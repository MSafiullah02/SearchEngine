            "text": "Glycosylation of proteins is a common post-translational modification, and eukaryotic cells are coated with complex carbohydrates associated with lipids or proteins forming the so-called glycocalix. Carbohydrates are the most abundant type of biomolecules on earth in term of biomass. Their biological role spans from the stabilisation of protein structure to their involvement in crucial biological events such as the development, growth or survival of a cell/organism (Varki 1993; Sharon and Lis 2004; Varki et al. 1999; Dwek 1996; Bertozzi and Kiessling 2001; Bishop et al. 2007). For instance, protein\u2013carbohydrate interactions are involved in intracellular trafficking of proteins, cell adhesion, cell recognition, cell differentiation and the development of the neuronal network. They are also involved in pathological events such as inflammation, metastasis (Galonic and Gin, 2007) and host\u2013pathogen interactions (Imberty et al. 2004; Seeberger and Werz 2007). For example, influenza virus takes advantage of the carbohydrate motifs present on the surface of the respiratory track endothelial cells for adhering to these cells (Skehel and Wiley 2000). The switch from avian influenza to human influenza sub-type is related to the subtle change of its ability to recognise the glycosylated motif of human respiratory track endothelial cell instead of the avian ones. The elucidation of these interactions is a critical issue not only in terms of fundamental research but also in terms of applied research for the development of diagnosis or new therapeutics.",

It has been calculated that a hexamer can lead to more than 1012 structures (Laine 1994). Secondly, carbohydrate synthesis is one of the most difficult and laborious synthetic work, and carbohydrates cannot be amplified enzymatically like DNA (by polymerase chain reaction) or cloned such as proteins. The consequence is that carbohydrate material is difficult to obtain in large amounts at affordable prices. Finally, carbohydrate interactions, especially with proteins, tend generally to be weak unless a multivalent interaction is involved, taking advantage of the so-called cluster effect (Lee and Lee 1995). Consequently, analysis of carbohydrate-mediated interactions requires analytical techniques with very low detection limit.",

They are polyfunctional biomolecules with the general formula Cn(H2O)n (e.g. n = 6 for glucose). The biological aspects of carbohydrates have long been underestimated because of their complexity in comparison to the three other classes of biomolecules. Polypeptides (proteins) and polynucleotides (e.g. DNA or RNA) are linear polymers, whereas carbohydrates are either linear or branched polymers, thereby increasing drastically the number of possible combinations (Laine 1994; Werz et al. 2007). Recent advances in glycobiology have demonstrated the numerous roles of carbohydrates in a series of biological processes such as storage and transport of energy, signal transduction, fertilisation, immune responses, pathogenesis, blood clotting, virus infection and cell-to-cell communication (Bertozzi and Kiessling 2001; Sharon and Lis 2004; Dwek 1996; Varki 1993; Varki et al. 1999). These fundamental discoveries found several applications in the design of carbohydrate-based drugs and vaccines against various diseases (Werz and Seeberger 2005b) such as malaria (H\u00f6lemann and Seeberger, 2006; Seeberger and Werz 2007), cancer (Galonic and Gin, 2007; Livingston and Ragupathi 2006) and AIDS (McReynolds and Gervay-Hague, 2007; Scanlan et al. 2007). The ever-increasing number of chemists, biochemists and biologists who are involved in research with carbohydrates is testimony to the fact that there is still a lot more work to be achieved in glycochemistry and glycobiology.",

Two explanations can be invoked based on dipolar moments or hyperconjugation (Fig. 7.6). Equatorial configuration of an electronegative anomeric substituent results in the formation of two similar dipoles repelling each other and destabilizing the molecule. On the contrary, axially orientated substituents create roughly opposed dipoles accounting for a lower energy state. The second explanation to the anomeric effect is the presence of a stabilizing interaction through hyperconjugation between an unshared electron pair of the endocyclic oxygen atom and the \u03c3* orbital of the anomeric bond (e.g. C\u2013Br).\n",

When a non-participating group is present at the 2-position, the major glycoside obtained is the \u03b1-anomer because of the stabilization through the anomeric effect. However, a participating group at the 2-position creates a cationic bis-acetal intermediate hindering the \u03b1-face of the pyranose ring and therefore favours the nucleophilic attack of the glycosyl acceptor from the \u03b2-face to give rise to the 1,2-trans glycoside. During this process, the alcohol could also form an orthoester which can be rearranged into the desired 1,2-trans glycoside under Lewis acid catalysis (Kochetkov et al., 1967, 1971).\n",

            "text": "Each glycosylation method can be distinguished through the glycosyl donor/promoter system involved (Table 7.2). Acetalation of a reducing sugar with an alcohol in the presence of a protic acid promoter was used as one of the first glycosylation method by Fischer (Fischer 1893; Fischer 1895). It is probably the most appropriate method for the synthesis of simple glycosides (e.g. methyl, benzyl, allyl). Glycosylation was then performed from glycosyl halides in the presence of heavy metal salts by Koenigs and Knorr (Igarashi 1977; Koenigs and Knorr 1901). Glycosyl fluorides can also be used as glycosyl donors and are much more stable than their chlorinated or brominated analogues (Mukaiyama et al. 1981). They can be activated under specific conditions compatible with most protecting groups. Peracetylated carbohydrates are particularly convenient for large-scale synthesis and can be also involved in a glycosylation as glycosyl donors but their activation sometimes requires drastic conditions (Helferich and Schmitz-Hillebrecht 1933). Glycosyl trichloroacetimidates were then introduced by Schmidt and are activated under acidic conditions with either Br\u00f8nsted or Lewis acids usually in the presence of molecular sieves and at low temperature (Schmidt and Michel 1980; Pougny and Sinay 1976). Arylthioglycosides are highly stable even when stored for long periods on shelves and can also accommodate a large number of chemical reactions on the pyranose ring. They can be activated by thiophilic reagents under mild conditions, and formation of the oxonium intermediate proceeds through the addition of the electrophilic promoter to the sulphur atom (Garegg 1997; Ferrier et al. 1973; F\u00fcgedi et al. 1987). Activation can also take place under single electron transfer, electrochemical or even high pressure conditions. n-Pentenyl glycosides were introduced by Fraser-Reid as glycosyl donors and are activated through halogenation of the terminal double bond followed by intramolecular cyclisation to provide the oxonium intermediate and a halomethyl-2-furane (Fraser-Reid et al. 1988; Fraser-Reid et al. 1992). Glycosyl phosphites (Kondo et al. 1992; Martin and Schmidt 1992; Zhang and Wong 2000) react with alcohols at low temperature in the presence of Lewis acids affording the corresponding glycosides, and glycosyl phosphates (Hashimoto et al. 1989; Vankayalapati et al. 2002) can be activated by protic acids. Activation of selenoglycosides (Mehta and Pinto 1991; Mehta and Pinto 1993) can be achieved under similar conditions as for thioglycosides, by photo-induced or single electron transfer or iodine. They can be selectively activated in the presence of thioglycosides.\n",

Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are natural enzymes capable of creating or hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds in an aqueous medium, using native sugars and with high stereo- and regioselectivities. Their use as \u201cglycosylating agents\u201d or promoters has attracted a lot of interest in the scientific community and a series of applications are now available for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharidic structures (Qian et al. 2001). This technology requires both biochemical and chemical skills since enzymes sometimes need to be mutated for obtaining the expected result. Sialylation is one of the most difficult glycosylation because of the poor stability of activated sialic acid derivatives. The biochemical engineering of sialyltransferases can readily provide a large series of sialylated derivatives ranging from the glycosylation of simple alcohols to mono- or disaccharides (Drouillard et al. 2006; Blixt et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2006b; Dumon et al. 2006; Muthana et al. 2007; Yu et al. 2006).",

The chemical conjugation of carbohydrate moieties to proteins or polyvalent species will create neoglycoproteins or neoglycoconjugates, respectively, which can find numerous applications in biology and biochemistry. After introducing a functionalised linker at the anomeric position of a carbohydrate through standard glycosylation methods, the other end of this arm will be used for its conjugation to the desired multivalent scaffold (Fig. 7.10).\n",

This methodology is now accessible due to the improved Cu(I)-catalysed processes developed more recently (Kolb et al. 2001; Rostovtsev et al. 2002; Bock et al. 2006; Tornoe et al. 2002; Gil et al. 2007; Bouillon et al. 2006; Morvan et al. 2007). This chemical ligation technique is highly attractive since the reactive species involved are pretty much unreactive to the chemical functions present in biological media, the reaction does not create any by-product and they can be performed in water, at low temperature and on reasonable time scales.\n",

Nojirimycin is produced by Streptomyces strains (Inouye et al. 1966).

Calicheamycin \u03b31I is isolated from Micromonospora echinospora and is used as an antibiotic (Nicolaou and Smith 1992). It binds to the minor groove of DNA showing a high degree of base pair sequence specificity which can be attributed to the oligosaccharide residues. Kanamycins are antibiotics affecting the 30S ribosomal subunit and preventing the correct translation of RNA (Maeda et al. 1957). Indeed, the proteins are biosynthesized but fold incorrectly, thus destroying the bacterium. Daunomycin is an anti-cancer chemotherapy agent of the anthracycline family and isolated from Streptomyces peucetius (Arcamone et al. 1964). Acarbose is an inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Junge et al. 1984). Streptomycin is an antibiotic drug obtained from the actinobacterium Streptomyces griseus and inhibits bacterial growth by damaging cell membranes and blocking protein synthesis (Majumdar and Kutzner 1962). Anthrose is found on the surface of Bacillus anthracis. This antigen is a very promising target for the development of an anti-anthrax vaccine (Tamborrini et al. 2006).\n",

Abacavir is a carbocyclic nucleoside analogue significantly less toxic than AZT and appears to have a stronger anti-HIV effect than any of the approved nucleoside analogues.

It is now accepted that these interactions strongly depend on divalent cations and show high specificity and low affinity. However, its mechanism is not yet clarified because of the difficulty in analysing weak affinity interactions. The main challenge to understand and control interactions between carbohydrates and lectins is the low affinity of the interactions. Nature overcomes this problem by a polyvalent presentation of ligands and receptors at the cell surface (Mammen et al. 1998).",

These endothelial cell adhesion molecules play a major role in cell recruitment from the bloodstream and in cell signalling. The three families of cell adhesion molecules present in the endothelial glycocalyx are the selectin family, the integrin family and the immunoglobulin superfamily. Selectins are carbohydrate-binding glycoproteins. These glycoproteins were designated as E-, P- and L-selectin, according to the cell type on which the selectin was found (i.e. endothelium, platelets, and lymphocytes, respectively). E-selectin and P-selectin are both involved in leukocyte\u2013endothelial cell interactions (Sperandio 2006). The carbohydrate ligands that are recognised by these selectins have been identified. E-selectin recognizes sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) on the surface of neutrophils. P-selectin also binds sLeX on neutrophils or leukocytes with a lower affinity. L-selectin weakly recognises sLeX on endothelial cells, but the affinity is higher with a sulphate group on the 6-position of Gal or, perhaps more likely, on the 6-position of the GlcNAc residue. Integrins are heterodimeric molecules composed of non-covalently bound \u03b1 (18 different \u03b1-subunits) and \u03b2 (8 \u03b2-subunits) subunits. Integrins are found on many cell types, including endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets. These integrins, such as \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b21, bind to multiple extracellular matrix ligands and are responsible for interactions with laminin, fibronectin, and collagen. Many studies have focused and still focus on the interactions between these integrins and the sub-endothelial matrix during angiogenesis (Ruegg and Mariotti 2003). The best known immunoglobulin superfamily of glycoproteins includes intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and 2 (ICAM-1 and -2), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). They act as ligand for integrins on leukocytes and platelets and are crucial mediators of leukocyte homing to the endothelium and subsequent diapedesis. In addition, glycoproteins of the endothelial glycocalyx display functionality in coagulation, fibrinolysis and homeostasis.",

Studies have shown that disruption of heparan sulphate proteoglycans of the endothelial glycocalyx stimulates firm adhesion of leukocytes (Constantinescu et al. 2003). Indeed, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are abundant on the endothelial cell surface, are highly negatively charged due to the presence of numerous sulfate groups, and bind numerous plasma proteins, contributing to the glycocalyx charge and thickness (Esko 1999; Yanagishita and Hascall 1992). The integrity of vascular endothelium depends on the number of negatively charged molecules at the endothelial cell surface. In myocardial tissue oedema, the decrease of microvascular fluid is associated with a reduction of negatively charged molecules (Gotloib et al. 1992).",

Indeed, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is important for sustaining multipotency and enhancing proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs)/neural precursor cells (NPCs). The signal of bFGF is mediated by receptors localized in the cell surface, but additional co-factors are also required. One of these co-factors is heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG; Fig. 7.1). In addition to HSPGs, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are also expressed in NSCs/NPCs. Nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2) is a CSPG expressed in heterogeneous cell populations, including glial precursor cells and/or NSCs (Belachew et al. 2003). Furthermore, NG2 displays high affinity for bFGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, which are mitogens of NSCs/NPCs and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (Goretzki et al. 1999).",

The GIPL of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas\u2019 disease, contains a unique glycan chain expressing slight variations among distinct T. cruzi isolates, and linked through a non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue to an inositol phosphorylceramide, mainly composed of an N-lignoceroyl-dihydrosphingosine (Carreira et al. 1996). The \u03b2-D-Galf-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-D-Manp substructure is involved in its antigenicity (Mendon\u00e7a-Previato et al. 1983). Biological effects of T. cruzi GIPL and its isolated glycan and lipid moieties were investigated on cells of the immune system. Dos Reis et al.

Control of this disease, which affects more than 20 million people worldwide, has been hampered by the absence of a vaccine, limitation with frontline drugs and the increased transmission as a result of co-infections with HIV (Croft et al. 2006). The promastigote stages of Leishmania are coated by a thick glycocalyx composed of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, the GPI-anchored phosphoglycan, lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and GIPLs (Naderer et al. 2004). Analysis of Leishmania mutants lacking individual or multiple surface components indicates that only LPG plays a critical role in macrophage infection, while loss of other surface components has relatively little affect on promastigote virulence in the mammalian host (McConville et al., 2007). The plasma membrane of Leishmania amastigotes is unusual in several other respects. It contains relatively high levels of externally exposed phosphatidyl serine, which may provide a mechanism for entering host cells via apoptotic cell receptors without activating microbicidal processes or proinflammatory responses (Wanderley et al. 2006).",

The four serotypes of DV (DV1\u2013DV4) bind to a number of opsonic and non-opsonic receptors on cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage including DC-SIGN (Navarro-Sanchez et al. 2003; Tassaneetrithep et al. 2003) and glycosaminoglycans (Chen et al. 1997). Recently, Miller et al. (Miller et al. 2008) have shown that the mannose receptor (MR) is a functional receptor for DV infection of human macrophage. MR and DC-SIGN both contain lectin domains, but differ distinctly in terms of ligand specificity. MR binds to terminal mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine, whereas DC-SIGN binds to mannose within high-mannose oligosaccharides and fucosylated glycans (Taylor et al. 2005; Feinberg et al. 2001).",

This means that the synthesis of oligosaccharides requires selective protections and deprotections of the desired hydroxyl function for coupling of monosaccharides through a glycosyl bond. Some authors have developed automated solid-phase synthesis, while some others have used a \u201cone-pot\u201d approach (Feizi et al. 2003; Werz and Seeberger 2005a; Seeberger 2008; Plante et al. 2001). Still others take advantage of enzymes (glycosidases or glycosyltranferases) to perform the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Glycosidases are enzymes that under usual conditions hydrolyse the glycosidic bond. However, as this reaction is reversible, under defined conditions, the enzyme can catalyse the formation of the linkage. Glycosyltransferases are enzymes that catalyse the glycosidic linkage formation between two saccharides. They are more efficient than glycosidases, giving better yields. However, the number of different enzymes is limited and expensive. The natural substrate of the enzyme is usually expensive as well. These reasons have motivated some authors to engineer whole bacteria with genes coding for the different enzymes required for oligosaccharides synthesis (Fort et al. 2005).",

In a simple medium where only one protein is present, the entropic factor (Norde 1985; Norde et al. 1986) seems to be the driving force for protein adsorption. Entropy is affected by the dehydration of both the surface and the protein, rearrangement of the protein structure and rearrangement of charged groups. The dehydration effect on hydrophobic surfaces can be viewed as the disruption of an ordered ice-like layer of water at the surface of the materials by the incoming protein. This disruption is due to surface\u2013protein hydrophobic interactions that are stronger than the surface\u2013water and protein\u2013water interactions. This leads to an increase in entropy.

Neutral hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Desai and Hubbell 1991; Jeon et al. 1991; Lee et al. 1997), polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, poly-N-vinyl 2-pyrrolidone, etc. seem to be ideal in this case. Some authors have described the use of polymers mimicking the lipid double layer (Ishihara et al. 1998; Ruiz et al. 1999).In the case of carbohydrate-based biosensors, Table 7.3 summarises the blocking strategies commonly described in the literature. It has to be ensured that the blocking protein does not have glycosylation motifs that can compete with the saccharide ligands and may interfere with the target molecule. Some authors have demonstrated that BSA can hide the probe immobilised at the surface from the target (Lesaicherre et al. 2002; Mac Beath and Schreiber, 2000).\n",

Such a tail can be introduced by the condensation of the azido functional group with sp2- and sp3-bearing molecules (Fazio et al. 2002), by aminoreduction (Fukui et al. 2002) or by the condensation of amine with isocyanate (Fazio et al. 2004). The group of Wang at Stanford University and the group of Feizi at Imperial College, London, have developed neoglycoconjugates bearing such tails for their immobilisation on nitrocellulose membranes or nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. Oligosaccharides (2\u201320-mers) are linked to amino phospholipid 1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or its anthracene derivative by reductive amination. The anthracene derivative allows quality control of the relative surface density of the probes (Palma et al. 2006). The group of Wong has derivatised oligosaccharides with a C14 alkyl chain through Cu(I)-catalysed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. A similar strategy was used by Huang et al. (2005). These two groups have demonstrated in various publications that this strategy is very efficient, allowing the immobilisation of femtomoles of compounds and with a very good signal-to-noise ratio.",

Many examples have been reported. However, it requires long reaction times and the yields are low. To circumvent these drawbacks, other authors have immobilised saccharides through hydrazide (Lee and Shin 2005; Satoh and Matsumoto 1999) or oxime (Zhou and Zhou 2006) linkages. Thiazolidine and glycosyl amide bonds have also been described (Larsen et al. 2006). The hydrazide linkage is poorly stable at low pH, while oximes are stable over a wider range of pH (Larsen et al. 2006). Nevertheless, the immobilisation of unmodified saccharides is advantageous with complex carbohydrates from natural sources. However, the main drawbacks are that the immobilisation reactions are limited to reactions involving the reducing end of the saccharides (and consequently cannot be used with non-reducing sugars) and they often lead to the opening of the reducing end ring while it may be crucial to maintain the structure of the molecule (Larsen et al. 2006).",

Immobilisation was performed by irradiation at 350 nm, leading to a reactive carbene, which reacted with the substrate. The advantage of this chemistry is the versatility of the reaction with respect to the substrate and the possibility of using photolithography for obtaining specific patterns of carbohydrate domains on the surface. In such a way, the immobilisation of galactose was performed on silicon, silicon nitride, diamond and polystyrene. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) analysis (Leonard et al. 1998; L\u00e9onard et al. 1998; L\u00e9onard et al. 2001) demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups present on diamond surfaces were involved in the immobilisation reaction. The resulting surface density was estimated to be in the range of 1012\u20131013 molecules per cm2. Square features of 25 \u00b5m were obtained using photolithography.",

Gb3 mimics were derivatised with a disulfide bearing 2 or 10 carbon alkyl chains as a spacer. The resulting molecules were self-assembled onto gold surfaces and the affinity of Shigatoxins 1 and 2 were studied. They found that Shigatoxin 1 binds to 2-carbon-derivatised Gb3 five times more strongly than 10-carbon-derivatised Gb3, while Shigatoxin 2 binds more strongly to 10-carbon-derivatised Gb3. Some authors (Sato et al. 1998) have demonstrated that the availability of the carbohydrate probe can be spoiled by steric hindrance due to compact packing. It may that the observed difference is related to the surface organisation of the probe. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the C10 long spacer forms compact layers compared to the C3 long spacer (Grubor et al. 2004).",

The architecture (distance between two saccharides residues, hydrophilic\u2013lipophilic balance) was designed by adjusting the linker between two pendant propargyl residues. Each glycomimetic was tagged with a DNA sequence bearing a cyanine 3 (Cy3) dye. The resulting molecules were immobilised on a DNA array (Dugas et al. 2004) bearing complementary sequence by means of DNA/DNA hybridisation. The fluorescent dye borne by the oligonucleotide permits a quality control of the immobilised molecules. Hybridisation was performed with a 1 \u00b5M solution of Cy3 \u2013DNA glycomimetic, leading to a probe surface density of 1\u20134 \u00d71010 molecules per cm2 as estimated by Dugas et al. with radiolabelled oligonucleotides immobilised under the same conditions. The resulting analytical device had a lower detection limit in the nanomolar range (albeit the use of a 1 \u00b5M solution of glycomimetic), which is similar to what is described in the literature where typical immobilisation solution concentrations are in the millimolar range.",

Similar results were found by Ebara (Ebara and Okahata 1994) with concanavalin A and glycolipids.

These molecules are capable, under illumination with a monochromatic light corresponding to their absorption maximum, of reaching an excited state. They return to the ground state by emitting a photon. The energy of the outcoming photon is less than that of the absorbed photon due to loss of energy by a non-radiative process. The difference between the maxima (in wavelength) in the excitation spectrum and the emission spectrum is called the Stokes shift. The ratio between absorbed photon and emitted photon is the fluorescence quantum yield. Table 7.4 gives some of the commonly used fluorescent dyes. Fluorescein and related molecules (Alexa, Oregon green, rhodamine, etc.) are four-ring structures with conjugated double bounds. FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) is affordable but has several drawbacks (Schena 2003). It is sensitive to self-quenching and photobleaching, and the fluorescent signal is influenced by pH (Schena 2003). The parent molecules of FITC (Alexa, Texas red, Oregon green, etc.) have additional polar, aliphatic and/or hetero cyclic groups that influence their excitation and emission spectra. These molecules are in general photostable. Furthermore, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH change over a broad range, have high fluorescence quantum yield and a long half-life of the excited state (Schena 2003).\n",

Using Maxwell\u2019s equations, one unique value for thickness and for refractive index of the layer of molecules is true for both phases of light. DPI gives absolute measurements and allows full characterisation in terms of mass, thickness and refractive index of the layer to be formed.

The resonance is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass on the surface of the acoustic resonator. When a thin film is attached to the sensor crystal, the frequency decreases. If the film is thin and rigid, the decrease in frequency is proportional to the mass of the film. In this way, the QCM operates as a very sensitive balance. The mass of the adhering layer is calculated by using the Sauerbrey\u2019s relation. For instance, with a crystal of resonant frequency 6 MHz, and considering an active crystal surface of 0.2 cm2 and a frequency resolution of 1 Hz, we can detect a change of 2.46 ng. For a long time, the main application of QCM consisted in monitoring thin-film deposition in vacuum or in gas phase (King, 1964). When QCM was used in liquid environments (Bruckenstein and Shay 1985), the number of applications increased dramatically, in particular in the biology field. For instance, an adsorbed protein monolayer on a surface electrode of 1 cm2 adds a mass of a few hundred nanograms (Muratsugu et al. 1993). But, the Sauerbrey equation developed for oscillation in air must be applied only to rigid masses attached to the crystal. Besides the mass, other physico-chemical parameters (such as viscosity, roughness, temperature) can induce a change in the resonant frequency. Thus, in liquid environment, Kanazawa and Gordon (1985) showed that quartz crystal microbalance measurements can be performed, in which case a viscosity-related decrease in the resonant frequency will be observed:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\Delta f = - f_0^{3/2}{({\\eta_{\\rm{l}}}{\\rho_{\\rm{l}}}/\\pi {\\rho_{\\rm{q}}}{\\mu_{\\rm{q}}})^{1/2}} $$\n\\end{document}where \u03c1\nl is the density of the liquid and \u03b7\nl is the viscosity of the liquid.",

Gold is usually used as the electrode material. When an alternating electric field is applied across the quartz crystal between the upper and lower electrodes, a mechanical oscillation of the characteristic frequency (f) is generated in the crystal. This resonant frequency shifts as a function of the additional bound material occurring at the upper surface. For adapting this system to molecular recognition, the metal surface is specifically biofunctionalised with a selective, passivating layer on which the analyte-specific receptor is immobilized. Appropriate flow channels with monitored microfluidics allow controlled introduction of the analyte. Nowadays, commercial QCM integrate user-friendly software for characterising the biomolecular interactions at the surface. A large variety of surface coatings have been proposed, allowing several optimized chemical treatments and biomolecule as the receptor grafting depending on the aimed interactions. Apart from the standard gold material, which is the most commonly used sensor surface because Au is chemically inert and easy to modify in different ways, we can find in product catalogues (Q Sense) electrode materials such as silicon dioxide whose main advantage is the ability to form lipid bilayers which act as a platform for further immobilisation of molecules; stainless steel surfaces used for studies of biofilm formation; titanium-coated surfaces mainly used for implant research; metals and oxides (aluminium trioxide, platinum, tantalum, tantalum nitride, tungsten, copper, chromium, iridium, iron, silicon carbide, iron carbide, silver and cobalt); and more recently commercially available polymers (polysterene, PMMA) deposited by spin coating.",

The binding affinity of Stx-1 to Gb3C10 SAM was estimated to be 1.2 \u00d7 108 (M\u22121). Secondly, upon addition of their glycoconjugates, they exhibited a notable inhibitory activity for the adhesion of Stx-1 to the Gb3C10 SAM (degree of inhibition going from 15% up to 70% versus glycoconjugate).",

In the case of ISFET, an ion-sensitive membrane is put in place of the metallic layer. This structure is intrinsically blocked, so no current flows between source and drain because whatever the potential applied at this two areas, one of the p-n junction is in reverse polarisation. When a positive voltage V\nG is applied between the gate and the source, the majority of holes tend to be repelled while the minority electrons of the p-substrate move to the channel. For V\nG > V\nT (V\nT is the threshold voltage), the electron density becomes larger than the hole density and the formation of n-type channel ensures electrical continuity between the source and the drain; the current flows from source to the drain.

The presence of the resulting products from the enzymatic reactions can be detected through the pH variation induced at the ISFET surface on which specific enzymes have been grafted. In this case, ISFET is called ENFET (enzymatic field effect transistor). Numerous molecular species can be detected by ENFET: for example, urease, glucose, organophosphorous pesticides. This type of transducer was also adapted for the detection of DNA hybridization. In this case, the SiO2 thin film was coated with an APTS (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) layer on which single-strand DNA was immobilised. This FET put in contact with a solution containing complementary DNA strands shows a strong drain current resulting from the field effect induced by the arrival of the negative charge borne by DNA strands under hybridisation (Souteyrand et al. 1997). This device was called GENFET. To exploit this field effect on a microarray, Souteyrand et al.

It was shown that the monoclonal antibodies bind the terminal tetrasaccharides as well as the natural hexasaccharides and that the fucose residue is compulsory for binding. However, serum from patients with breast cancer binds both the fucosylated and defucosylated pentasaccharide, probably due to the polyclonal nature of the serum.

The mannose residues are involved in the entry of the virus into the host cells by interacting with CD4, a chemokine family receptor present at the surface of T-lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, etc. Furthermore, the mannose residues are involved in protecting the virus from antibodies directed against GP120 by hiding the targeted epitope. This mannose oligosaccharide has been considered a potential target for the design of vaccine (it interacts with the 2G12 antibody (Calarese et al. 2005)) or as potential target for prophylactic measures. In the latter case, proteins interacting with the hyper-mannosylated moiety of GP120 would prevent the entry of the virus into the host cell. Adams et al. designed a glyco array bearing different mannose and studied the affinities of 2G12, CD4, Scytovirin (a potential anti-HIV protein), Cyanovirin N (CVN, a cyano bacteria protein with potential anti-HIV properties) and the dendritic cell lectin DC SIGN involved the internalisation of the virus. Detection was performed with FITC labelling (Adams et al. 2004). It was shown that each protein has specific requirements concerning the structure of the mannosyl oligosaccharide. For example, an \u03b1-1\u20132 linkage alone is necessary for the interaction of 2G12. The binding profile of the Scytovirin showed that the terminal \u03b1-1\u20132 mannose linkage at the terminal non-reducing end is required.",

Influenza virus is an enveloped virus with a segmented negative RNA genome. Its envelope bears two proteins: hemagglutinin (HA, around 5,000 copies) and neuraminidase (3\u2013500 copies). HAs interact with the sialic acids present at the surface of the host cell, permitting adhesion of the virus. It is the specificity of the HA towards the sialic acid linkage that determines the host specificity of the influenza virus. Human influenza viruses preferentially bind the \u03b1-2\u20136 linkage present at the surface of the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory track and lungs, while the avian ones recognise the \u03b1-2\u20133 linkage present in epithelial cells of the intestine of birds.
