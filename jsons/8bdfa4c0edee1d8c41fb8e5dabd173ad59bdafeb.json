All three polyester versus foam swab comparisons 184 exhibited a tendency for the foam swab to have lower Ct values than the polyester swab, 185 indicating the foam swab's superior ability to detect virus.

The exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an enormous demand for testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease. This increased demand has put a strain on every level of the system from personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by health care workers while administering the test, to swabs for collecting the samples, to viral transport media (VTM) to store the sample until tested, to laboratory capacity 2,3,4 . Efforts to provide viable alternatives for each of these supply shortages are 49 crucial to keeping the healthcare workforce safe and the testing throughput high.The shortages of PPE and swabs are driven, in part, because the originally recommended nasopharyngeal (NP) test cannot be self-administered, requiring a change in PPE for each test. A recent study showed that patient-collected foam nasal swabs were comparable to health care worker-collected NP swabs for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus, providing a safer and less invasive sampling method 5 . These results validate findings for influenza testing 6,7 . While these results open the possibility of using patient-collected foam nasal swabs for sample collection, reducing the risk of viral exposure for health care workers, several issues remain.
