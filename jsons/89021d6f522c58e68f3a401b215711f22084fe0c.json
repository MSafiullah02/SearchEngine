Gram-negative bacteria i.e. staphylococci, enterococci, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli, Neisseria sp., pseudomonads are most frequently associated with infant deaths due to sepsis, up to 92% of cases in several clinical studies reported to date (2) . Mortality due to sepsis is largely due to aberrant immune reactions in the patient (collectively known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, SIRS -which results in septic shock), marked by an interplay of proand anti-inflammatory host factors, in combination with cellular exhaustion (3, 4) . At present, the clinical management of sepsis relies on antibiotics, largely comprising ampicillin or penicillin in combination with gentamicin for infants below the age of 2 months. For infants older than 2 months, benzylpenicillin plus chloramphenicol is used. In clinical cases suspected of sepsis due to staphylococcal infection, a combination of flucloxacilin and third-generation antibiotics is administered, although the latter has become the mainstay of treatment in many developing countries due to its low cost (2, 4) . Third-generation cephalosporins are also used in drug-resistant infections causing sepsis; however, resistance to all types of chemotherapeutic agents in current clinical practice for sepsis treatment have been frequently reported (2) .",

Blockade of IL-1 receptor with recombinant human IL-1R antagonist (anakinra) did not result in a significant improvement of 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis (10) . Newer strategies aimed at reducing mortality have focussed on modulation of host physiological pathways involved in secretion of inflammatory cytokines (pharmacological reduction of IL-1\u03b2 using glyburide) (11, 12) cholesterol metabolism (administering recombinant high-density lipoprotein) (13) and T-cell exhaustion (targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway using recombinant antibodies) (14, 15).",

In mammals, sialic acid is an integral component of several cellular receptors, participating in general physiology and homeostasis (16) . Influenza virus easily targets host cells expressing sialic acid-containing receptors for entry and replication. Cleavage of this motif using sialidase-based agents i.e. DAS181 would contribute to dramatic reduction in viral load (17) . Besides influenza, a myriad of other pathogens including and not limited to Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium tetani, MERS-CoV and H. pylori also use sialic acid-containing receptors to initiate pathogenesis in humans -either for cell entry, toxin uptake or immune suppression (16) . These receptors therefore present a highly attractive target for host-directed therapy. One such receptor, DPP4 (host receptor for MERS-CoV entry) has already been discussed earlier in this review, and is the target of the currently used anti-diabetic drugs sitagliptin and vildagliptin (18) .",

It was later shown that pharmacological blockade of EGFR using gefitinib concomitantly abolished p38 MAPK activity in M. tb-infected cells, consequently killing intracellular bacteria via autophagy. Subsequent preclinical validation of this phenotype resulted in reduced M. tb proliferation in the lungs of infected mice (25) . MAPK inhibition could therefore be a viable strategy to control excessive inflammation and tissue destruction during the course of progressive TB disease.",

Although the use of complement proteins themselves is not host-directed, administration of the antibody-binding complement protein C1q to patients may enhanced pathogenic-specific antibody activity to control infection and disease, at large. Nevertheless, a novel therapeutic peptide (EP67) derived from the Cterminal of the C5a complement protein (involved in formation of the membrane attack complex on the surface of bacteria) was evaluated against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in mice (mouse model of dermonecrosis). Treatment with EP67 appeared to reduce GBS load in the vaginal tract, showing a direct bactericidal effect against the cocci (33) . In MRSA-infected mice, subcutaneous EP67 treatment resulted in reduction of skin lesion size and bacterial load coupled with increased neutrophil infiltration to ameliorate disease (34) .",

As such, VEGF, semaphorins, TGF-\u03b21 and heparin glycans can bind to the NRP1 receptor complex to initiate the signalling cascades that promote angiogenesis, neural system development and cell adhesion (44) . NRP1 can also be shed from cells, and is thus detectable in serum (45) . Although NRP1 is strongly associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) in mice, it is rather a marker for activated human T cells, in addition to its absence on human Tregs (46) . NRP1 expression is reflective of poor prognosis in lung, prostate, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer, which led to its development as a therapeutic target (47) . The inaugural clinical trial with anti-NRP1 mAb (MNRP1685A) against advanced solid tumours (including lung, pancreatic and CRC) was published in 2014, displaying a good safety profile in patients (48) . Co-administration of MNRP1685A and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) has also been clinically investigated in patients with advanced solid tumours, but reconsideration of the standard bevacizumab dose is required, if given in combination with MNRP685A (49) . Pertaining to infectious diseases, NRP1 has been associated with promotion of liver cirrhosis in patients with HCV infection (50), enhancement of EBV entry into human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (51) as well as HTLV-driven syncytia formation in human T cells (52) .
