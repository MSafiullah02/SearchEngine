            "text": "The method commonly used to prepare vaccines consists of obtaining sufficient amount of attenuated or inactivated pathogens and administering this material to humans or animals. Attenuated forms of the pathogen are generally obtained by natural mutation followed by a selection. The number of random mutants may be increased by using mutagenic chemicals or irradiation. Alternatively, known virulent genes may be removed from the pathogen genome using genetic engineering. The native pathogen may also be inactivated by physicochemical treatment. This approach suffers from several limitations. Attenuated exploitable forms of the pathogen may not be obtained in all cases. The tools commonly used for that purpose are animal cell lines and chicken eggs. The live vaccines obtained in this way are generally potent but their composition is complex and they may induce severe deleterious effects precluding their use. This was the case for a live-attenuated vaccine against rotavirus, which induced severe intestine inflammation (intussusceptions) [1]. New vaccines still containing attenuated retrovirus are under development with expected reduced side effects 2., 3.. Even in case of success, possible unknown side effects may persist with live vaccines. One is that the vaccinated persons are effectively protected but still shedding wild active viruses contributing to support the epidemic. Another problem generated by the use of attenuated or inactivated pathogen is that it is difficult to make a distinction between animals or humans who are vaccinated and those who are infected. Indeed, the same antibodies against the pathogens are present in the blood of both categories of animals or people. The absence of one gene of the pathogen may make the distinction possible between vaccinated and infected individuals. Alternatively, serum antibody markers resulting from the immunization by a foreign antigen added to the vaccine may also distinguish vaccinated and infected individuals.",

            "text": "A possible alternative consists of using subunits of the pathogens containing one or a few proteins organized as in the pathogens and forming virus-like particle (VLP) in the case of viruses [4]. This approach is expected to be safe as the material does not contain nucleic acids from the pathogen or from the vectors used to carry the gene coding for vaccinating proteins, which may be plasmids or viral vectors. This approach also makes it possible the distinction between vaccinated and infected individuals as antibodies are raised against most of the pathogen proteins after infection and only against a few of them after vaccination. The preparation of recombinant vaccines may be efficient but not easy to implement. Indeed, a long study may be necessary to define which proteins have a sufficient vaccinating capacity and ideally are efficient against most if not all the forms of the pathogens. The proteins cannot generally be obtained from the pathogen in sufficient quantity. Systems capable of providing large amounts of recombinant proteins at a low cost must then be implemented. The isolated proteins are also generally less potent to induce an immune response than the whole pathogens, mainly if they are living. This implies the use of potent adjuvants, which must be devoid of deleterious side effects. The vaccinating proteins must therefore be purified to prevent any immune response against their contaminants. The vaccinating potency of recombinant proteins is largely unpredictable and this obliges experimenters to evaluate the efficiency of various modes of administration with different adjuvants.",

This brute-force method already resulted in an unprecedented burst of new antigen discovery. A less laborious approach recently met a great success to identify new antigens from group A Streptococcus. This method consists of releasing fragments of the surface antigens by treating the bacteria with proteases. The peptides were identified by mass spectrometry and the corresponding genes were cloned to prepare and evaluate the corresponding antigens. This method allowed the fast identification of antigens for vaccination [5]. This method should be applied for a number of pathogens [6].",

This system is relatively simple to use and it proved efficient to prepare well-assembled viral proteins forming VLPs [4]. To reach this goal, the viral genes are introduced into baculovirus by homologous recombination in insect Sf9 cells. The resulting viral particles are used to infect a large number of Sf9 cells that produce high amounts of viral proteins, which are not secreted but stored in cytoplasm to form spontaneously well-shaped VLPs. The VLPs can be isolated from cell lysate and purified using different protocols. One of them consists of fractionating VLPs in cesium chloride gradients. Several VLPs prepared in this way show structure similar to native corresponding viral complex as judged by electron microscopy and biochemical analysis. The baculovirus system makes it possible the preparation of VLPs from a broad variety of viruses having or not a simple or a double capsid and an envelope [4]. This tool allows the preparation of VLPs in sufficient quantity to determine their structure and to evaluate their vaccinating properties. The baculovirus-Sf9 system cannot be easily scaled up to prepare vaccines at an industrial scale.",

One of these tools is the Agrobacterium tumefaciens system which contains a natural vector able to transfer a foreign gene into the plant genome. The other known as biolistics consists of projecting minute bullets covered by DNA into plant cells. In both cases, viable plants are developed from transformed somatic cells. A large number of transgenic plants can be obtained making it possible the selection of those in which the transgene is intact and functional.",

Low amount of antigens might induce a tolerance in humans or a basal unknown vaccination. This problem cannot be solved easily. Plants may be sterile to prevent any dissemination of the transgene. Another proposition which has been retained by companies involved in the production of recombinant proteins by plants is to limit the gene transfer to plants not used for human feeding such as tobacco or alfalfa [23].

Blood, milk [38], egg white 39., 40., seminal plasma [41], urine and silk gland [42] and insect larvae hemolymph [43] are other theoretical systems (Table 2\n). Silk gland is a promising system in particular cases. Preliminary results indicate that active human factor VII can be found in different tissues of a transgenic fish (tilapia). It is not known if this system may be improved and scaled up (McLean unpublished data). Blood cannot store high levels of recombinant proteins most of the time. Moreover, proteins in blood may alter the health of the animals. Milk avoids essentially these problems. Several mammalian species (rabbits, pigs, sheep, goats and cows) are currently being used to produce recombinant proteins in their milk. Rabbits offer a number of advantages: easy generation of transgenic founders and offspring, high fertility, relatively high milk production, insensitivity to prion diseases, and no transmission of severe diseases to humans. Pigs are more costly but produce higher amounts of milk than rabbits. Ruminants are potentially the most appropriate species to produce large amount of proteins but they need cloning or lentiviral vectors to integrate foreign genes, their reproduction is relatively slow, they do not glycosylate proteins as well as rabbits and pigs and they are sensitive to prion diseases. Until recently, egg white was considered as a promising system strongly limited by the great difficulty of generating transgenic birds. This difficulty appears now surmounted. Lentiviral vectors proved efficient in chicken. More impressively, pluripotent cell lines have been established in chicken and quail. These cells harboring foreign genes can be reintroduced in early embryos and participate to the development of chimeric transgenic animals [40]. In a previous experiment, the same group showed that chimeric transgenic chicken generated by using non-pluripotent cells was able to secrete a monoclonal antibody in egg white. This antibody was functional but a reduced half-life due to the lack of sialic acid in the terminal end of the carbohydrate chain [39]. These experiments validate egg white as a source of foreign proteins including recombinant vaccines.",

Alum is well tolerated and presents a good safety record. However, it is a relatively weak adjuvant for antibody induction against recombinant vaccines. It induces mainly a Th2 immune response and is not efficient for activation of cellular immunity (Th1) [49]. Thus alum adjuvant is suitable when antibody-based protective immunity is required (for example induction of neutralizing antibodies), but alum lacks the ability to induce mucosal IgA. This can impede efficiency of several vaccines where a strong mucosal immunity is needed to prevent pathogen entry and replication into host. This is for example the case for rotaviruses that replicate in the intestine causing severe gastroenteritis, and for which intestinal IgA were shown to protect against disease [50]. Other limitations of alum adjuvants are increased IgE production, allergenicity and neurotoxicity 49., 51., 52.. Alum also cannot be effective in some vaccine formulations [49]. Despite its extensive use for many years, alum mechanism of action is not completely understood. Adsorption of antigens onto alum results in the formation of a depot at the site of injection. The particulate structure of the alum/antigen complex may facilitate uptake by antigen presenting cells and alum could activate complement and macrophages [49]. The saponin Quil A, derived from the bark of a Chilean tree, Quallaja saponaria, or purified extracts none as QS-21 have been evaluated as alternatives to alum for cell-mediated responses activation. The observed toxicity (local reactions, hemolysis) associated with these adjuvants renders their use in humans limited to life threatening diseases like cancer or HIV infection [53].",

It has been shown with a number of different antigens in several animal models including non-human primates (reviewed in [55]). In mouse, ISCOM-based vaccines were shown to be potent inducers of Th1 immune responses, contrarily to aluminum-based vaccines. In non-human primates, strong long-lasting CD4+ and CD8+ responses were observed following immunization with the core protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) complexed to the ISCOMATRIX (a preformed ISCOM preparation) in addition to humoral responses [56]. The mechanism of action of ISCOM is not fully understood. It is believed that because of their particulate structure their uptake by antigen-presenting cells is more efficient.

ISCOM-based vaccines have been administered to several recipients and showed to be safe with low reactogenicity. Common adverse events were reaction at the site of injection and myalgia of mild intensity and of short duration. ISCOMS appear to be interesting candidates for human use.

            "text": "The exact mechanism of action of CpG ODN is not precisely elucidated, but it is known that CpG ODN act mainly through activation in the innate immunity. The innate compartment of the immune system evolved to recognize general structures commonly found on a broad range of pathogens. These include the structure of the bacterial and of many viruses DNA, which unlike vertebrate genomic DNA, contain a high proportion of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. Bacterial and other pathogens DNA can be recognized directly by the innate immune system through the interaction with the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) which, in humans, is present in B-cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). In mice, TLR9 is also expressed in monocytes and in myeloid dendritic cells. The effect of TLR9 activation is the induction of a proinflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1) and a Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune response (reviewed in [66]). CpG ODN mimic the presence of bacterial DNA and primarily trigger activation of the innate immune system. CpG ODN are rapidly internalized by immune cells where they are bound by TLR9. The TLR9 activation caused by CpG ODN administration can enhance antigen-specific humoral or cellular immune response against co-administered antigens. Contrarily to humans, TLR9 in mice is not only expressed in B-cells and pDC but also in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. This observation renders difficult the extrapolation of the encouraging results obtained in mice to humans because these cells may play important roles in vaccination efficiency. However, data obtained from clinical trials in humans showed efficacy of CpG ODN adjuvants. Co-administration of CpG ODN with hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) to healthy adult volunteers, either alone or in combination with alum, resulted in increased IgG titers compared to the control group receiving Engerix-B alone [67]. Furthermore, hepatitis B-specific surface antigen antibodies appeared earlier when immunizations were carried out with CpG 67., 68.. Inclusion of CpG adjuvant also increased the proportion of antigen-specific high-avidity antibodies [69]. An accelerated antibody response combined with increased magnitude and avidity was also observed when healthy volunteers were immunized with the anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) when CpG ODN were included [70]. So far, treatments with CpG ODN were well tolerated, and the adverse effects observed among recipients only included pain and erythema at the site of injection, and mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that did not last and did not impede daily life activities [66]. Taken together, these results underline the potential of CpG ODN adjuvants both in animals and humans. Although more studies are needed and important points remain to be addressed (like the possibility to induce autoimmune diseases in recipients [66]), CpG ODN appear to be promising tools. Interestingly, CpG ODN could benefit from the large-scale \u2013 good manufacturing practices \u2013 industrial production technologies developed during the past few years for the antisens drug development (which have been approved by the US FDA) [71].",

            "text": "Two bacterial toxins were identified as powerful mucosal adjuvants: the cholera toxin (CT) and the related heat labile enterotoxin (LT) produced by Escherichia coli. Both toxins consist of a catalytic subunit A (CTA or LTA) associated with a pentameric cell-binding B subunit. CTA and LTA subunits possess an ADP-ribosyl transferase enzymatic activity resulting in permanent adenylate cyclase activation in targeted cells, increased cAMP production and hypersecretion of salt and water into the bowel 72., 73.. The CTB and LTB parts allow the binding to cell surface through their association with GM1 gangliosides, which result in the internalization of the toxic A subunit. These toxins are internalized by polarized epithelial cells and it is thought that co-administered antigens may follow the same route. These toxins induce strong systemic and mucosal immune responses and increased responses against co-administered antigens. Vaccinations with CT and LT as adjuvants produced Th1 and Th2 responses. They showed excellent efficacy in inducing protective immunity when administered via the nasal and rectal route and to a lesser extent via the oral route 65., 74., 75.. However, the strong toxicity of these molecules precludes their use in humans (ingestion of 5 \u03bcg of CT in human would result in the induction of a 5-l watery diarrhea). Several less toxic derivatives that retain adjuvanticity were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutants comprise the LT K63, LT R72 and LT R192G forms of LT. The LT K63 and LT R72 bear single amino acid substitutions in the catalytic A subunit. Both mutants differ in the residual enzymatic activity, which positively correlates with their adjuvanticity. LT R192G contains a single amino acid substitution in a protease sensitive portion of the catalytic A subunit [76]. This mutant with reduced enterotoxicity shows great adjuvanticity when delivered mucosally either by the nasal, oral or rectal route 10., 74., 75., 77.. Interestingly, intranasal delivery of antigens in combination with CT, LT or its derivatives induces mucosal responses even at distant sites. When rotavirus virus-like particles (VLP) were administered intranasally, strong mucosal and systemic responses were induced together with intestinal IgA production 74., 78..",

Zot binds a receptor on intestinal epithelial cells and increases mucosal permeability by acting on the structure of epithelial tight junctions.

LPS have strong adjuvant properties but excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines linked to repeated administration of LPS leads to endotoxin shock characterized by inflammation, profound hypotension and organ failure [86]. Because of this elevated toxicity, LPS cannot be used in humans. An LPS-mimetic compound called monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), exhibiting adjuvanticity and low toxicity has been generated. MPL, like LPS act by interacting with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on antigen presenting cells resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 and INF-\u03b3, which will ultimately enhance the adaptive immune response (humoral and cellular). In preclinical studies, MPL has been shown to generate Th1-type immune response to antigens [87]. The molecular mechanisms resulting in the lower toxicity of MPL versus LPS are not clear; but recently, Okemoto and collegues [88] showed that contrarily to LPS, MPL activation of macrophages does not result in the release of IL-1\u03b2 (a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the endotoxin shock [89]), nor the activation of caspase-1 (also involved in the induction of endotoxin shock).",

Most of them rely on the entrapment of the antigens into polymer-based particles in the case of microspheres, or into lipid-based membranous vesicles in the case of liposomes. Microspheres are composed of biodegradable polymers, mainly polylactide (PLA) or poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The polymers degrade in vivo to form non-toxic lactic and glycolic acids. Administered microspheres allow controlled antigen release: it may form a depot at the site of injection, allowing the slow release of the antigen for extended periods. It can thus minimize the number of doses required for immunization. Liposomes are bilayered vesicles composed of phospholipids and other sterols surrounding an aqueous center where the antigens can be entrapped. Liposomes allow for prolonged release times of antigens.",

This immunization regimen often leads to induction of systemic immune responses and circulating antibodies but a poor mucosal immunity. This type of immunization is suitable when serum neutralizing antibody induction is needed to prevent pathogens to replicate or to reach their target cells in the host. This is for example the case for HBV vaccine delivered parenterally by injection, where neutralizing antibodies mediate protection. However, it is generally considered that in order to produce protective immunity it is best to vaccinate via the natural route of infection of pathogens. Most pathogens infect hosts via the mucosal epithelium that represents 90% of the body surface: respiratory tract (respiratory syncitial virus), gastrointestinal (enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus), vaginal (papillomavirus, HIV) or rectal mucosa (HIV). At present, a great challenge for vaccination is to stimulate a strong mucosal immunity to prevent pathogen entry into host.",

These include degradation of the antigens in the harsh gastrointestinal environment (acidity, bile salts and pancreatic secretions), and induction of oral tolerance to the antigens. One major feature of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is the homing of circulating activated B-cells at distant effector sites from the site of induction [97]. This feature allows, for example, for the production of intestinal or vaginal IgA after intranasal immunization 74., 78., 98.. Intranasal immunization has been widely used in mouse and is recognized as a very potent induction site for protective immunity in a number of cases. However, this immunization strategy may not be well adapted for humans. Indeed, the nasal epithelium is in close contact with the olfactory bulb and the central nervous system (CNS). The close vicinity of these structures renders the intranasal delivery of bacterial toxin-based adjuvants a dangerous approach for mass vaccination since toxins and co-administered antigens could penetrate the CNS 99., 100., (and see also NIAID July 9, 2001 meeting summary at http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/enteric/meetings.htm).",

HBV VLPs were also used to carry large polypeptides like GFP (Kratz) or the ectodomain of the outer surface protein A (OspA) from Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. HBV/OspA hybrid VLPs immunization could protect mice against challenge with Borrelia burgdorferi\n[111]. In another study, inclusion of a B-cell epitope tag into hepatitis E virus (HEV) VLPs induced specific antibody responses against both the VLP and the B-cell epitope. Sedlik et al. showed that porcine parvovirus VP2 capsid protein carrying a CD8+ T-cell epitope from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein retain its capacity to assemble into VLPs. Immunization of mice with these hybrid VLPs resulted in strong cytotoxic T-lymphocytes responses against the CD8+ epitope and protected mice against a lethal challenge with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [117]. It is important to mention that in some of these experiments, vaccinations were successfully conducted without the use of adjuvant, underlining the immunostimulatory effect of VLPs on the foreign epitopes.",

The demand of vaccines including recombinant vaccines remains relatively modest as these biopharmaceuticals require relatively a high investment in research. The amount of product to be prepared is relatively low. Vaccination is a preventive operation. This implies a very low level of risk. The price of vaccines is expected to be low, especially when they are to be used in developing countries.
