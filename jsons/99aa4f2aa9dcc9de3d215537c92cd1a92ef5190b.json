More than three lakh (339,181) persons have been globally infected with pandemic virus and counting. To date, no precise and dedicated vaccination has been found. There is a global fear of 2019-nCoV and most of the people are distressed from this epidemic (COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, 2020). The growth rate of infection, causality, and recovery is completely uncertain for this pandemic. Uncertainty and unpredictability are creating a more stressed environment which may increase the number of psychological disordered patients (Zandifar and Atefeh, 2020) .",

Out of 415 cases, 84 % of the cases are of Indian nationals and 9.8 % of the total positive cases belong to foreign nationals. Fortunately, to date, the rate of causality is only 1.68 % (Ministry of health and family welfare, 2020).",

To date, most of the infection is restricted to the upper-class society where the victims have a direct or indirect connection with the infected counties (China, USA, Italy, and London). A great disaster may occur in case the virus is entered into the person who lives in dilapidated houses. These people are normally not aware of the real consequences of this pandemic and even do not have enough resources to cope with this infectious disease. Additionally, the late or undiagnosed cases may create an immense chain of an infected person. The government is taking all kinds of preventive measures to stop mass destruction and causalities from 2019-nCoV. Consequently, most of the schools, colleges, organizations, and offices have been already shut down for the safety of the nation. Several cities and states have been temporarily locked down. All the national and international meetings and conferences have been aborted or postponed until further notice. The examinations of the students have been postponed. The use of public transportation has been restricted. Curfews have been imposed in some areas. However, still, there is chaos and stress in all cities and states of India. The lifestyles, as well as the lives of the Indians, have been significantly affected by this stressed and chaotic environment. These shutdowns and the curfews have momentously affected the small and large scale businesses. There is a hard time for daily wages and labourers. The parents feel worried with respect to the health and loss of study of their children. The pangs of this pandemic have also closed several pilgrimages as well as the holy places in India. The consequences of this pandemic have also shattered the Indian stock market well. A couple of lower circuit has been faced in a span of just two weeks. Most of the Indian stocks (cement, banks, and textiles) have been shambled (Sensex, 2020) .",

This segregation causes a state of fear both for victims and their families. In spite of the good global recovery rate, the 2019-nCoV suspected/infected victims have a fear of their lives. Even their families are stressed in fear of the loss of their members. One of the 2019-nCoV victims who mistakenly correlated his viral illness to the 2019-nCoV has committed suicide under the depression of this pandemic. The influx of panic messages transmitted over social networks was found to be the main cause of this loss (Goyal et al., 2020) . This kind of tragedies can be abridged by sharing and directing the nation to follow the authenticated information only. Moreover, the psychiatrist can act as a significant supporter of this pandemic. They can provide the guidelines for the nation to avoid the adverse consequences of these catastrophic events. Above all, people need to be aware of all government advisories/guidelines and do follow the same for their safety and well being (Banerjee, 2020) . Furthermore, the long-prevailing of this pandemic may significantly increase the number of stress, depression and anxiety patients and it will ultimately knock down the doors of other fatal human disorders (Kaur and Sharma, 2019) .",
