            "text": "In different areas of our planet, human activities such as deforestation and hunting are threatening the survival of many wildlife species. Additionally, accidental or intentional introduction of different organisms is exerting additional pressures on native animal species, and in certain cases the former becomes invasive. 1 In natural habitats, introduced animals have been shown to reduce or eliminate populations of endemic species through different mechanisms, such as direct predation or the reduction of available resources. 2 This increase in native-exotic animal interactions also presents a potential for \"pathogen pollution,\" or the introduction of a pathogen into a new geographic area or host species. 3 Invaders may also act as an additional competent host for native pathogens, thereby increasing infection rates of native species via spillback mechanisms. 4 Additionally, invader-borne pathogens may have more subtle and persistent effects and alter the outcomes of trophic or competitive interactions. 5 In fact, a shared pathogen can have considerable impact on the population size and the distribution of native species, even if the introduced species does not compete directly with the native species for resources; this is called \"apparent competition\" and is illustrated by the success of the invasive gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and the decline of the native red squirrel (S. vulgaris) in the United Kingdom-the result of apparent competition mediated by a parapox virus. 6, 7 Species inhabiting island ecosystems tend to be more heavily affected by invasive species because they lack appropriate behavioral traits or immunologic capacity, making them particularly vulnerable to the threat of introduced species and/or their associated pathogens. 8, 9 The high rate of bird extinction on Hawaii due to the introduction of arthropod vectors and the transmission of avian malaria and avipoxvirus are cases in point. 10, 11 Madagascar is a well-known biodiversity hot spot with approximately 90% of plant and animal species being endemic, including all nonhuman primates (superfamily: Lemuroidea), all native rodents (subfamily Nesomyinae), a 43 Disease Risk to Endemic Animals From Introduced Species on Madagascar FIDISOA RASAMBAINARIVO AND STEVEN M. GOODMAN radiation of insectivore-like animals (family Tenrecidae), and 9 of its 10 wild carnivorans (family Eupleridae). 12 Through a series of colonization events, probably during the Tertiary Period via some sort of over-water rafting, the ancestor for each of the four groups of terrestrial mammals occurring on the island (primates, rodents, insectivores, and carnivorans) established initial populations; their subsequent adaptive radiations produced the high diversity and 100% endemism rate observed today. 13 The diversity of the herpetofauna of Madagascar is even more impressive, with 390 species of nonmarine reptile species described on Madagascar up to 2013. 14 Of these reptile species, more than 92% are considered endemic and almost all of the 400 amphibian species are also endemic. 15, 16 Madagascar's fauna is remarkable not only by the diversity of endemic taxa found on the island but also because of the absence of entire families that are otherwise present in nearby continental Africa. For instance, no member of the families Canidae, Felidae, and Bovidae have naturally crossed the 400-km Mozambique Channel separating mainland Africa from Madagascar. The different dispersal filters and subsequent isolation of the animals that were able to colonize the island successfully may have important implications for the sensitivity of Malagasy animals to diseases carried by exotic species.",

            "text": "Human colonization of the island occurred some 4000 years ago and since then was associated with a series of introductions of domestic and peridomestic animals such as zebu, dogs, cats, rats (Rattus spp.), and mice (Mus musculus). 17 These introduced animals are negatively impacting endemic species and may even lead some native species to extinction. For instance, a survey has shown that in some areas of Madagascar, black rats (Rattus rattus) now constitute 95%-100% of the rodent population, effectively replacing the endemic rodents, even in rainforest habitats away from human habitation (Dammhahn, unpublished data). 18 Likewise, research on carnivorans inhabiting several regions of Madagascar has shown an alarming correlation between increasing numbers of introduced cats and dogs and decreasing detection of endemic euplerids and lemurs. 19 As sparrow [Passer domesticus] and house crow [Corvus splendens]). These nonnative birds may facilitate the introduction of pathogens and pose different threats to the native Malagasy avifauna, as has been the case for bird populations elsewhere. 10, 11 For example, in the Gal\u00e1pagos, it is thought that the introduction of the avipoxvirus and Haemoproteus blood pathogens in the 19th century was associated with either pet caged birds or natural songbird migration. 32 Some species of Haemoproteus are known to reduce the physical condition and reproductive success of captive and wild birds; on Madagascar, this genus and Plasmodium are transmitted by numerous species of mosquitoes living sympatrically with native birds. 33, 34 Most studies of bird pathogens on Madagascar focus on domestic fowl, and only a few investigations have documented pathogens infecting the island's native birds. 33, 35 West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, is widely distributed in parts of the Old World. During the summer of 1999, this virus was introduced in the Western Hemisphere presumably by the transport of infected humans, birds, or mosquitoes and spread rapidly, causing morbidity and mortality of birds and mammals in the United States and Canada. 36,37 On Madagascar, evidence of WNV exposure was found in both introduced and native animal species including birds, peridomestic rodents, fruit bats (Pteropus rufus), and several lemur species. 31,38-40 However, the phylogenetics of the WNV strains isolated on Madagascar suggest a local WNV transmission cycle with no new, recent introductions of WNV despite the migration and introduction of several bird and arthropod species on the island. 31,39 The introduction to Madagascar of a foreign strain of WNV might have a dramatic effect on the local fauna.",

Virulent forms of NDV cause widespread and highly contagious disease in both domestic and wild birds. 41 It is responsible for the high mortality of chickens in rural Madagascar, which in turn causes important economic burdens. 42 In most cases, domestic bird infections on the island implicate genotype XI of NDV, a form related to the variant responsible for the first pandemic of Newcastle disease (genotype IV), whereas wild birds are primarily infected by genotype Ib, although some are also infected by genotype XI. 43,44 These results suggest that genotype XI circulates across Madagascar between wild and domestic birds and may potentially affect either the native or exotic bird populations via spillover and spillback mechanisms. 45 A recent study has disclosed that certain coronaviruses, specifically of the genus Gammacoronavirus, are present in wild Malagasy birds, particularly species living in aquatic habitats. 46 Coronaviruses are found in a variety of animals, in which they can cause respiratory, enteric, and neurologic diseases. This particular genus is associated with infectious bronchitis virus, but birds that tested positive did not appear to be affected. 46 The strains of avian coronaviruses detected elsewhere in the world, the reason for the observed declines is likely a combination of factors, including resource competition, predation, and disease. 20, 21 This chapter attempts to review the literature on pathogen introduction from exotic hosts and highlights the risks of disease introduction on the rich and unique fauna of Madagascar.",

It has also been hypothesized that these toads might affect Madagascar's native carnivorans through their cardiotoxic toxins. 23 An additional concern regarding this invasive toad species is the cointroduction of pathogens, particularly Ranavirus and the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytridium dendrobatidis (Bd). Both have been associated with major declines in amphibian populations elsewhere in the world. 24, 25 Madagascar was previously considered to be one of the last major land masses without this amphibian fungal pathogen. 26 Despite several surveys and long-term research, the presence of the pathogen was not confirmed on Madagascar before 2010. 26, 27 More recently, the fungus was detected on several amphibians shipped from Madagascar to the United States. 28 Subsequently, and as a result of coordinated efforts, the pathogen was found in wild frogs in multiple areas across the island, where representatives of all anuran families have tested Bd-positive. 26, 28 However, results from field surveys from the same sites are conflicting, and there has been no evidence of mass amphibian mortalities, raising the question of whether the pathogen is firmly established or is recurrently introduced. 29 In its native range, the Asian common toad is also known to harbor potentially zoonotic pathogens such as Salmonella 30 ; by extrapolation, its introduction to Madagascar may also become a concern for public health or the native Malagasy fauna.
