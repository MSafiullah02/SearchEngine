            "text": "The compact genomes of viruses offer a limited number of protein targets for the development of anti-infective therapy. Structured RNA elements in viral genomes and transcripts have the potential to expand the target space for antiviral drug discovery. Precedent for clinically approved RNA-binding drugs is found in natural product-derived antibiotics including macrolides, tetracyclins, oxazolidinones, and aminoglycosides which interact with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of bacteria and block protein synthesis in the pathogens [1, 2]. The well-defined structure of rRNA provides selective binding sites for these antibiotics which serve as a paradigm for RNA recognition by small molecule ligands. RNA elements in viruses have been extensively explored as potential drug targets in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [3, 4] whose genomes include conserved noncoding regions (ncRNA) that may present structured binding sites for small molecules [5, 6]. Challenges and successes in the discovery and design of compounds targeting RNA have been discussed in the previous comprehensive review articles which also provide a historic perspective on past efforts to explore viral RNA targets for small molecule inhibitors [7\u201312]. In the current chapter, I describe progress on discovery and investigation of small molecule ligands for viral RNA targets over the last 2\u20133 years and include perspectives on potential new viral RNA targets which have not yet been widely explored but may attract interest in pathogens of unmet or emerging medical needs (Table 1).\n",

The HIV transactivation response (TAR) and Rev response (RRE) regulatory elements were among the first non-ribosomal RNA targets investigated for the discovery of small molecule inhibitors [17\u201323]. Other potential HIV RNA targets for small molecule ligands include the dimer initiation sequence (DIS), the packaging signal (\u03a8), and the Gag/Pol frameshift site (FSS). Three-dimensional structures have been determined for all HIV RNA regulatory elements by NMR and crystallography studies (Fig. 1). Previous efforts targeting HIV RNA have been reviewed comprehensively (Table 1) [3, 10, 11, 13\u201315].

Frameshifting depends on two distinct RNA motifs, including a slippery sequence for the reading frame change and a downstream motif whose relatively stable secondary structure stalls the ribosome. In HIV, an RNA hairpin with a long GC-rich stem serves as the frameshift motif. Ligands binding at the HIV FSS target may disrupt or stabilize the RNA hairpin and thereby affect the equilibrium between translation of structural and enzymatically functional viral proteins.

The HCV IRES adopts a structured fold comprised of four discrete domains which play key roles in the recruitment and assembly of host cell ribosomes. An RNA internal loop motif in subdomain IIa serves as a conformational switch during translation initiation and provides the binding site for selective inhibitors of viral translation. The small molecule ligands capture an extended conformation of the RNA switch and inhibit IRES-driven translation [32]. Discovery of the IRES binding HCV translation inhibitors and studies of their mechanism-of-action have been described in a comprehensive previous review [4]. Here, I will discuss the HCV IRES target (Fig. 2a) as well as a recently described G-quadruplex target in the C (nucleocapsid) gene.

Because of this crucial role for viral propagation and the high conservation of the IRES RNA sequence in clinical isolates, this ncRNA element has been recognized early as a potential drug target [35, 36]. Among the first inhibitors of IRES-driven translation described were phenazines [37] and biaryl guanidines [38] identified by high throughput screening against reporter translation in cells. IRES binding was not revealed in these studies but structural features of the two chemical series suggest that the compounds may interact with RNA. Screening for direct binding to the viral RNA was the basis of a high-throughput mass-spectrometry approach that identified 2-aminobenzimidazoles as ligands of the subdomain IIa internal loop in the HCV IRES (Fig. 2a) [39]. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that these compounds act as allosteric inhibitors of an RNA conformational switch [32]. Further investigations revealed that the HCV IRES subdomain IIa motif is the prototype of a new class of RNA conformational switches occurring in the IRES elements of flavi- and picornaviruses. Unlike traditional metabolite-sensing riboswitches, the viral RNA switches are structurally well-defined in both ligand-free and bound states and function as ligand-responsive, purely mechanical switches [40].",

Crystal structure determination has provided insight into the conformational states of the HCV subdomain IIa switch in the absence [41] and presence [33] of ligands. It has been suggested that the 2-amino-benzimidazoles are fortuitous ligands of a guanosine binding site [42] which lock the subdomain IIa target in an extended conformation and thereby inhibit IRES function. In the RNA complex, the 2-aminobenzimidazole inhibitor binds in a deep solvent-excluded RNA pocket that resembles ligand interaction sites in aptamers and riboswitches (Fig. 2a) [33].",

A conserved guanine-rich sequence of the HCV core (C) nucleocapsid gene may transiently fold into an RG4 motif under physiological conditions. Porphyrin derivatives such as tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) bind to the RG4 fold and stabilize the RNA motif sufficiently to inhibit viral replication and translation in HCV-infected cell culture [43]. While these findings support a potential RG4 motif in HCV as a new target for antivirals, a recent genome-wide study in yeast and human cells suggests that RG4 motifs are globally unfolded in eukaryotes, likely due to association with abundant single-stranded RNA-binding proteins [44]. However, it is conceivable that RG4-binding ligands may trap guanine-rich sequences in the quadruplex conformation and thereby affect biological processes.",

Duplex formation between ends of segments leads to circularization of the vRNA and produces a promoter for transcription and replication [48]. NMR studies revealed the RNA promoter as an A-form duplex containing a noncanonical A\u2022C base pair next to a uracil base that forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond interaction with two consecutive adenine residues in the opposite strand (Fig. 2b) [49]. These structural features induce widening of the RNA major groove in the promoter helix near the polymerase initiation site and may provide a selective recognition motif for small molecule inhibitors of influenza virus RNA replication. Ligands that interfere with replication by binding to the promoter structure would provide a novel route for the development of anti-influenza drugs. In Sect. 3, I will discuss recent studies of such RNA promoter-binding ligands [34].",

Ribosomal frameshifting maximizes the coding content of the viral genome by regulating translation of overlapping reading frames [31]. In some RNA viruses such as SARS CoV and HIV, a \u22121 frameshift during translation enables a transition in the production of highly expressed structural proteins to viral enzymes expressed at low levels. Ribosomal frameshifting occurs at a slippery sequence and is triggered by a downstream structured RNA motif that stalls the ribosome. The frameshift in HIV translation is triggered by a stable RNA hairpin that has been explored as a target for ligands aimed at stabilizing or disrupting the RNA fold. These earlier efforts on targeting the HIV frameshift signal have been summarized in recent reviews [3, 15]. The SARS CoV frameshift motif is an RNA pseudoknot [50] which has recently been studied as a target for small molecule ligands that inhibit ribosomal frameshifting [51, 52].

Unlike members of the hepacivirus family (e.g., HCV), these pathogens do not rely on an IRES element for translation but employ other structured RNA motifs for translational control, replication, and host defense suppression (Table 1) [53]. Conservation and structural features of flaviviral RNA elements suggest that they might be the viable targets for selective small molecule ligands interfering with the biological function of these RNAs. The best-studied motif among such elements is the replication promoter in the 5\u2032 UTR of the Dengue virus (DENV) genome which recruits the viral RdRp [54]. During replication initiation, the viral RdRp binds at an RNA three-way junction, designated as stem-loop A (SLA), which comprises the first 70 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 UTR [54, 55]. Replication of the DENV genome is preceded by circularization through complementary sequences in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of the UTR and ORF, similar as in the influenza A virus. However, unlike in influenza A, circularization of the DENV genome does not involve the RNA promoter motif SLA [55]. The DENV SLA was discovered by secondary structure prediction and confirmed by enzymatic as well as chemical probing [56\u201358]. Key structural elements of the DENV SLA three-way junction are highly conserved in different serotypes and clinical isolates. Mutation studies demonstrated that structural and conformational integrity of the SLA is essential for the function of the RNA promoter [54, 56], which suggests that ligand binding at the RNA may achieve a similar inhibitory effect.",

            "text": "The etiologic agents of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever are filoviruses which carry a (\u2212) ssRNA genome. Similar as in the insect-borne flaviviruses and the influenza A virus, filovirus replication requires a structured RNA promoter but unlike in the former viruses the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the filovirus genome do not interact during replication. Chemical probing has established an extended hairpin within the first 55 nucleotides of the filovirus genome which serves as the replication promoter in both EBOV and MARV [59, 60] and represents a potential target for small molecule inhibitors of viral replication. Other potential RNA targets in the filovirus genome occur in the long intergenic regions (IGR) which separate the reading frames for seven structural virus proteins. Specifically, the IGR between VP24 and VP30 has been proposed to adopt a two-armed stem-loop fold including an RNA four-way junction [61]. RNA hairpin motifs as potential targets in filoviruses are found at transcription start sites and the 5\u2032 UTR of viral transcripts. A hairpin loop at the transcription start site binds the VP30 nucleocapsid protein which serves as an anti-termination factor [62, 63]. The 5\u2032 UTR elements of viral transcripts derive from IGR and contain hairpin structures which have been proposed to regulate transcription and translation [64]. A recent bioinformatics analysis of the EBOV genome suggests that a conserved guanine-rich sequence within the L gene coding for the viral RdRp may fold into a G-quadruplex (RG4) that is stabilized by a porphyrin ligand (TMPyP4), similar to the RG4 motif discovered in the HCV core gene [65].",

            "text": "Among DNA viruses that contain potential RNA targets for the development of antiviral drugs is the oncogenic Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which causes malignancies in AIDS patients. KSHV-induced tumorigenesis involves the viral homolog of the FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) [66]. Translation of this protein is driven by a structured RNA element that contains an IRES including a conserved segment of 252 nucleotides [67, 68]. The vFLIP IRES consists of an independently folding RNA core domain whose secondary structure has been determined by chemical probing and mutational analysis [69]. The IRES RNA, together with a series of hairpin motifs following immediately downstream, provides structurally well-defined sites for ligands that may suppress vFLIP expression. A second RNA target in KSHV for potential antiviral intervention with small molecule ligands is a conserved hairpin motif which acts as an enhancer of nuclear retention element (ENE) [70]. The ENE is a 79-nucleotide sequence in the 3\u2032 terminus of the 1,077-nucleotide polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) ncRNA, which is the most abundant viral transcript during lytic KSHV replication [71]. PAN is an essential component required for viral propagation whose accumulation relies on posttranscriptional stabilization dependent on the cis-acting ENE RNA motif [70]. The ENE sequesters in cis the PAN poly(A) tail in an RNA triple helix that protects the ncRNA from decay and leads to PAN accumulation [72]. The ENE hairpin, which contains a U-rich internal loop, and the ENE\u2013poly(A) triple helix complex are potential targets for small molecule ligands that may interfere with KSHV replication.",

While several derivatives showed binding to TAR in an assay that measured fluorescence changes upon compound titration to a terminally dye-conjugated RNA, only a histidine conjugate (3a; Fig. 3) was a selective ligand whose target interaction was not affected in the presence of competitor nucleic acids. A tighter binding lysine derivative (3b; Fig. 3) was compromised by promiscuous binding to other nucleic acids. Antiviral activity testing of the S nucleobase conjugates 3 in HIV-infected human cells resulted in IC50 values over tenfold lower than TAR binding affinity which suggests that these compounds may act also on targets other than TAR.",

Around 1,120 FDA-approved drugs were tested for the ability to block complex formation between the RRE SL-IIB RNA and a fluorescent dye-conjugated Rev peptide [90]. Two drugs, clomiphene and cyproheptadine (4 and 5; Fig. 3), were identified as inhibitors of HIV transcription that affected levels of spliced versus unspliced viral transcripts. It was shown that clomiphene (4), which is approved as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, bound to the RRE SL-IIB RNA with a K\nd of 12.4 \u03bcM and had antiviral activity with an EC50 value of 4.3 \u03bcM in cells. Cyproheptadine (5), which is used as an antihistamine H1 receptor antagonist, bound the RRE RNA with a K\nd of 1.8 \u03bcM and inhibited viral replication with an EC50 value of 17.5 \u03bcM. While the interaction of clomiphene (4) with the RRE RNA target was specific, target binding of cyproheptadine (5) was compromised in the presence of competitor nucleic acids. Interaction sites of the drugs 4 and 5 with the RRE target were investigated by NMR, revealing the G-rich internal loop in the lower stem of the SL-IIB RNA as the binding site. This region overlaps with the binding site of Rev, consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition by competition between the small molecule ligands and the viral protein. Interestingly, compounds 4 and 5 are quite hydrophobic and lack hydrogen bond donors which suggest that a large number of heteroatom hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are not required to confer RNA targeting properties to small molecule ligands.",

The 2-aminobenzimidazole ligands, which were initially discovered in a high-throughput mass-spectrometry approach, were optimized for target binding by using structure\u2013activity relationship data, resulting in inhibitors such as 6 (Fig. 4) which had an affinity of 0.9 \u03bcM (K\nd) for the IRES target and showed anti-HCV activity in cell culture with an EC50 value of 3.9 \u03bcM [39]. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that the 2-aminobenzimidazole compounds act as allosteric inhibitors of an RNA conformational switch in the subdomain IIa [32]. A FRET-based assay was developed to test compounds for the ability to bind and lock the conformation of subdomain IIa, leading to viral translation inhibition, and thereby identifying inhibitors that capture the IRES RNA switch in an extended state [32, 91]. Crystal structure analysis of the subdomain IIa target in complex with inhibitor 6a revealed the ligand binding in a deep solvent-excluded pocket of the RNA [33]. Structural characteristics, depth, and complexity of the ligand binding pocket suggest that drug-like inhibitors may be developed that target this RNA as selective inhibitors of HCV translation.\n",

Closer analysis of the ligand binding site in the subdomain IIa led us to the design of the amino-quinazoline fragment 9 (Fig. 4) whose spiro-cyclopropyl modification targets a small pocket at the backside of the inhibitor interaction site [95]. While the fragment 9 showed only moderate binding affinity to the HCV IRES target, the positive impact of the hydrophobic spiro-cyclopropyl substituent on ligand binding suggests that inclusion of carefully placed nonpolar groups that improve shape complementarity is a promising strategy for optimization of compounds binding to RNA. Compared to the 2-aminobenzimidazole and oxazole compounds 6\u20138, the fragment 9 stands out for the simplicity of synthesis which is achieved in only two steps from commercial starting material, thereby allowing straightforward preparation of more potent derivatives in the future.",

In a recent study, NMR fragment screening of an oligonucleotide representing the RNA promoter against over 4,000 compounds identified the amino-quinazoline derivative 13a (Fig. 6) as a selective ligand with a target affinity of 50 \u03bcM [34, 105]. Modeling of the RNA\u2013ligand complex based on NMR NOE distance constraints suggested binding of the quinazoline ligand 13a in the major groove at a motif including a bifurcated U < A/A motif (Fig. 2b). While the NMR model of the promoter complex shows the quinazoline 13a interacting with the RNA target by close contacts of ligand methoxy substituents, it is not clear how much contribution to binding may be attributed to hydrogen bonds involving C\u2013H donor groups which are weak and quite rare but not without precedent [106].\n",

Synthesis of analogs derived from 13a furnished compounds 13b and 13c which had slightly better binding affinity for the RNA promoter and improved activity as inhibitors of viral replication (Fig. 6) [105].

A three-dimensional structure model of the RNA pseudoknot was used for in silico docking which identified the 1,4-diazepane 14 (Fig. 6) as a potential ligand [50]. Subsequent testing revealed 14 as an inhibitor of SARS CoV translational frameshifting in vitro and in virus-infected cells [50]. More recently, binding of 14 at the viral pseudoknot was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), however with a relatively weak K\nd of 210 \u03bcM [107]. Comparison of single-molecule unfolding of the SARS CoV pseudoknot RNA in the absence and presence of 14 suggested that ligand binding reduces the conformational plasticity of the RNA fold which, in turn, affects ribosomal frameshifting [108]. The ability of the RNA fold to adopt alternate conformations and structures are determinants of frameshifting efficiency rather than thermodynamic stability of the RNA fold or its impact on ribosomal pausing. Therefore, ligand-induced frameshifting modulation may only partially rely on stabilization of an RNA fold. Previously described inhibitors of HIV translational frameshifting may affect ribosome function through promiscuous RNA binding rather than by binding to the viral genomic frameshifting signal [15]. Similarly, the SARS CoV pseudoknot-binding ligand 14 may interact with other RNA targets as well, which may explain the over 450-fold higher potency of this compound as a frameshifting inhibitor in a cell-based assay [50] compared to its binding affinity for the pseudoknot RNA [107].",

Development of small molecule inhibitors is challenging for structured RNA, however, as target drugability and ligand selectivity have to be carefully evaluated. RNA folds rarely contain deep and structurally rigid binding pockets which are the most promising targets for drug-like ligands. Among viral RNAs, such characteristics are most prominently found in the HCV IRES subdomain IIa which offers additional advantages in targeting as a switch motif whose conformational states may be affected by ligand binding in a deep RNA pocket. Similar well-defined ligand binding sites are present in bacterial riboswitches which have been explored as antibiotic targets [109, 110]. Just recently, a novel class of synthetic antibacterial compounds has been discovered, which exert their activity through an unprecedented mechanism of action that involves targeting a bacterial riboswitch involved in cofactor metabolism [111]. This success story of antibiotic discovery for a bacterial RNA target sets a promising precedent for ligand discovery directed at viral RNAs which provide future therapeutic opportunities defined by the targets\u2019 structural complexity, participation in key processes of infection as well as high conservation in the pathogens.",
