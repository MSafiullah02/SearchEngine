To monitor the dynamic changes of viral shedding, we obtained throat swabs from patients every day during hospitalization and every other day during follow-up after discharge. Fecal specimens were collected applying a similar rationale since the first day of sample collection (samples from case 3 were only collected during follow-up period). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercial kit approved by the China Food and Drug Administration as described previously.8 The PCR assay simultaneously amplified two target genes of SARS-CoV-2 included open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N). A cycle threshold (Ct) value no more than 40 with evident amplification curve was considered as a positive test, and a value of 40 indicated the virus was molecularly undetectable. Ct values were used to approximately reflect the viral load (inversely related to Ct value) in respiratory tract and digestive system, a method suggested in recent studies on a similar topic.2\n,\n12\n",

During clinical practice, we noticed the time for viral RNA in respiratory specimens turning negative was similar between pediatric patients and infected adults (these children's family members). At this point, adult patients had negative results for nucleic acid testing in fecal specimens, whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools of the two infected children. Therefore, we conducted a quarantine and surveillance protocol for the children and their family members who were already qualified for hospital discharge according to current standards (with two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in throat swabs and sampling interval at least 1 day). Concerned about the possibility of fecal-oral transmission, we recorded the timeline of changes in nucleic acid testing results in both throat swabs and fecal samples collected from these patients (Fig. 3\n). All adult patients of the two families were negative for fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Strikingly, RT-PCR results remained positive in stools of the two children for 8 and 20 days, respectively, after nucleic acid turning negative in respiratory samples. Consistently, Ct values of the serial fecal and respiratory specimen test suggested the gastrointestinal tract might shed virus for a longer duration than the respiratory system with a greater load in case 1 (Fig. 4\n). While viral RNA measurements were not available for the other two children as they were either transferred or admitted in another hospital where the laboratory only reported positive or negative results for RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 without additional information.",

From available data, children appeared to be slightly affected by SARS-CoV-2, a feature resembling that of SARS-CoV emerged 17 years ago.18 However, the relatively low attack rate of COVID-19 in children could be explained by the stringent implementation of home confinement and prolonged school closure during the outbreak as required by the Chinese governments. Whether it is also the case during school year is hard to tell. One distinct feature of pediatric cases is that the majority of them are infected through household contact with adult patients.10\n,\n19, 20, 21, 22, 23 As with all new diseases, many characteristics of COVID-19 still remain unknown.

Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract.27 However, these researchers did not address whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was more common in certain age group than the others (patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 78 years in this study).

Caregivers of these children should take precautionary measures and avoid direct contact with children's waste. During the SARS outbreak of 2002\u20132003, viral RNA was detected in the sewage water from hospitals receiving SARS patients.29 In some rural areas and underdeveloped regions with poor sanitation in China, stools are often used as natural fertilizer in agriculture. As sewage cannot be properly disinfected in these places, it might be possible that SARS-CoV-2 polluted water causes infection in wild animals which bring the virus back to humans, creating a vicious cycle.
