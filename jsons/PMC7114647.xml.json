            "text": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are common causes of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Surveillance for nosocomial infections (NIs) is an important component of an effective infection control programme.1 The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system coupled with feedback and interventions successfully reduced the infection rate among participating hospitals.2 Unfortunately such prospective surveillance is costly and labour intensive. Prevalence surveys are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, although rates obtained are higher than comparable incidence rates and may be statistically less stable.3 Despite their limitations they provide a useful estimate of HAI. French et al. conducted serial point prevalence surveys in our hospital 15 years ago. These proved to be a practical and useful way of documenting the trend of HAIs and assessing the impact of an infection control programme.4 Conducting a prevalence survey also raises awareness among healthcare professionals of infection risks in hospital settings.5, 6 The objectives of this study were to determine the rate of nosocomial infection and the use of antibiotics. Knowledge of the current situation and major changes in distribution of nosocomial infections should help to prioritize resource allocation, allow a more effective infection control policy and enable a targeted prospective surveillance programme.",

This rate was much lower than those found in 1985\u20131988 in PWH (7.3%),15 as well as in other countries (6.5\u201313.95%).6, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 Apart from the overall rate, rate reductions were found in HAP (from 1.8 to 1.4%), SSI (from 1.5 to 1.1%), and UTI (from 2.6 to 0.8%) without making case-mix adjustments15 (\nFigure 1). This probably relates to improved infection control following the SARS crisis in Hong Kong, as evidenced by increased resources and heightened awareness among healthcare workers (HCWs). Our hospital had one infection control nurse per 250 beds after 2003 as compared to the previous ratio of 1:700. Infection control programmes, such as \u2018alert organism\u2019 reporting, biannual hand hygiene audit, regular infection control educational/training to HCWs and SSI surveillance have since been implemented. Heightened infection control awareness was demonstrated by the high compliance rate in hand hygiene audit among HCW. The low prevalence may also relate to a short duration of hospital stay and rapid transferal to convalescence hospitals after initial diagnosis and stabilization.",

Secondly, the definition did not take into account urinary catheters, as symptoms of UTI other than fever cannot be assessed in catheterized patient.20 The frequency of SUTI therefore depended upon: (i) Frequency of catheter use: 26% of the patients had an indwelling urinary catheter; (ii) Urine analysis protocol: in our hospital, urine is only analysed when the signs and symptoms indicate a UTI or when a catheterized patient develops a fever. Symptoms of UTI in patients with a serious major disease of other organs may have been ignored; and (iii) Physician's diagnosis: data collection based on doctor's diagnosis may not have been sensitive enough to record all UTIs.",

The remaining 35% may have represented treatment of infections not fulfiling the CDC criteria or inappropriate antibiotic prescription. Recent surveys showed that suboptimal antimicrobial prescription is frequent in our hospital.22 Though appropriateness of antibiotic prescription was not the aim of current study, unnecessary antibiotic combinations were noted (Table III). Broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g. imipenem, meropenem and cefepime, accounted for about 20% of the antibiotics being prescribed on the day of survey. Audit of \u2018big-gun\u2019 antibiotics in local university hospitals revealed that 20\u201325% of the prescriptions were not justified or suboptimal.22, 23 The upcoming antibiotic stewardship programme targeting this group of drugs should help to optimize use of antimicrobials in the hospital.23\n",
