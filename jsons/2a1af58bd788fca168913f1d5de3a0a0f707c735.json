            "text": "A recent editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that muraglitazar, a diabetes drug under development, may be associated with an unexplained increased rate of conditions associated with inflammation such as stroke and heart disease [1] . Muraglitazar acts through the binding of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically the PPAR-c family. In addition to modulating insulin sensitivity, activation of these receptors leads to an acute reduction in inflammation [2] . As we proposed earlier in the case of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents [3] , a paradoxical host response to chronic muraglitazar use may produce compensatory increased levels of inflammation that would explain the heightened cardiovascular risk. Such paradoxical long-term sequelae have now arisen in two classes of drugs with entirely distinct mechanisms of action. This finding suggests that such effects may not necessarily arise from invoking specific functional pathways, but may originate instead from a more fundamental physiologic response -a conclusion that provides greater support for our hypothesis. Indeed, if we consider other agents with this conceptual framework in mind, we may find that this source of risk has existed and may still exist for many other medications. This para-digm may highlight the need for significant changes in how we approach the temporal dimension of treatment. Question 1 (existence). FLI responded with, ''H5N1/asia virus can be produced completely in vitro by using reverse genetics. The virus generated this way, also called infectious clone, cannot contain contaminants from sick animals'' [translated from German]. However, PCR cannot be used to identify viruses which have not been previously sequenced [5] .",

He developed Reye's Syndrome and died eleven days later [7]. A search commenced for causation within a limited range of flu viruses. H5N1 was claimed causative, even though coronaviruses, flaviviruses, enteroviruses, other pathogens and chemicals can also cause flu symptoms. There was no confirmation of prior avian contact. Regardless, warnings of an ''explosive pandemic'' appeared in this early document, though FLI conceded: ''There is no scientific forecasting method that can evaluate the possibility that an influenza virus induces a new pandemic.''

            "text": "Paclitaxel is an effective agent in the treatment of breast cancer. Green et al. [1] reported the results of a randomized trial of preoperative chemotherapy comparing 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel (80 mg/m 2 ) followed by four cycles of 5-fluorouracl-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (FAC) with four 3-weekly doses of paclitaxel (225 mg/m 2 ) also followed by four cycles of FAC in 258 patients with operable breast cancer. Pathological complete response rates were 29% and 13% for those treated with weekly and 3-weekly paclitaxel, respectively (P = .01). Moreover, superiority of weekly compared with every 3-weekly paclitaxel in terms of response rate and time to progression was also shown in metastatic breast cancer [2] . One potential mechanism of weekly paclitaxel antitumor activity is that more frequent delivery of moderate doses may achieve greater efficacy than standard 3-weekly paclitaxel. More frequent exposure to paclitaxel may enhance its apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects [3] . Taghian et al. [4] in their study evaluated the interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and oxygenation before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using sequential paclitaxel and doxorubicin in patients with breast cancer tumors of P3 cm. In their phase II protocol, paclitaxel was administered on a weekly schedule at a dose of 80 mg/m 2 for nine cycles. They found that paclitaxel significantly decreased the IFP and increased the oxygenation, whereas doxorubicin did not cause any significant changes. Recent study by Pachmann et al. [5] showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel in breast cancer patients causes release of breast cancer cells into circulation, while at the same time reducing tumor size. During the applied combination therapy, three different phases were observed. A first decline in the number of circulating tumor cells during epirubicin containing part of regimen, followed by a steep increase during paclitaxel treatment and a subsequent re-decrease if a third regimen with cyclophosphamide-methotheraxe-5-fluoruracil combination was administered. We assume that since IFP may be a barrier for tumor cells entering into circulation, weekly paclitaxel may eliminate this barrier by decreasing IFP. Additionally, since circulating tumor cells correlate with patient outcome [6] and weekly paclitaxel may increase anthracycline drug concentration at tumor tissue level by decreasing IFP, giving weekly paclitaxel first then anthracycline in a sequential manner at neoadjuvant setting may be more optimal schedule in breast cancer patients.",
