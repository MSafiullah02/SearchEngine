Altruism and the medical profession have been linked throughout the history of medicine (McGaghie et al. 2002; Feldman 2017). While there are a myriad of reasons why students choose to matriculate in medical school, altruism and desires to alleviate suffering and promote healing are common features in the calling to medicine (Kutner and Brogan 1980; Gy\u0151rffy et al. 2016; McGaghie et al. 2002; Coulehan and Williams 2001; Feldman 2017). Despite a dedication to these values, altruism in medicine is threatened by empathy erosion and burn out which are increasingly prevalent among medical students. Currently, there are two widespread movements in medicine aimed at addressing the dual loss of altruism and physician and student burnout\u2014professionalism and wellness. Despite widespread recognition of the problems and programs aimed at improving them (Yasin et al. 2019), there has been little headway, and even calls to abandon altruism in the modern marketplace of medicine.",

This paper proposes the ESIA model as an ethical framework to allow medical students to synergize the interests of the self with those they serve in a mutually beneficial relationship to improve patient care and the healthcare system at large.",

            "text": "The ESIA model acknowledges that egoism and altruism are intertwined, dynamic motivators of behavior. In the enlightened self-interest approach, the interests of the group are also the interests of the self. The physician\u2013patient relationship is a dyad in which egoism and altruism may converge in an enlightened way that acknowledges that the interests of one are the interests of the whole. Students pursue medicine for self-fulfillment in cognitive, emotional, technical, and social desires\u2014all of which can then be used to benefit others. When the needs of the self are fulfilled, one can serve others, which in turn is a self-interest, as service to others can be deeply rewarding and provide a sense of accomplishment, pride, and interconnectedness. ESIA is a paradigm shift from the historical view of egoism and altruism as opposing motivations where altruism is self-sacrifice in the self-flagellation culture of medical school. This paper will present the threats to altruism, explore the interface of egoism and altruism in a clinical vignette, and then present the ESIA framework as an educational approach to aligning the interests of providers and patients to move from surviving to thriving in order to promote altruism.",

It alone does the work of charity in a Jovian and God-like way, dispensing with free hand truly Promethean gifts\u201d (Osler 1932, p. 282). Altruism has been a defining feature of medicine throughout time. It is a core component of the ancient Hippocratic Oath (Feldman 2017). The commitment to care for persons with infectious diseases despite personal risks was explained by understanding medicine as a moral enterprise, driven by the virtuous acts of providers (Zuger and Miles 1987). These virtuous acts are not a historic past of plagues, but ongoing, as seen with the recent Ebola outbreak. Despite inadequate personal protections, healthcare workers (defined as doctors, nurses, and midwives) in Africa continued to provide care to infected persons, and the epidemic resulted in the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers (Yakubu et al. 2016; Evans et al. 2015).",

It relies on altruistic acts such as donating blood and organs, participating in human research, and sharing health information. These acts may involve bodily discomfort, unpredictable adverse effects, or psychological stress. While the altruism of these acts has been challenged, the personal rewards are typically nominal compared to the act itself, with the greatest reward often being the emotional satisfaction that results from the charitable act such as giving blood (Ferguson and Lawrence 2016).",

In the Physician Charter, altruism is declared the fundamental principle that is necessary for fostering trust in the physician\u2013patient relationship (ABIM Foundation et al. 2002). The Medical Schools Objective Project, sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges, states in bold text \u201cPhysicians must be altruistic\u201d (Association of American Medical Colleges 1998, p. 4). The beginning of medical school has been considered to be a crossing of a threshold and a transition in one\u2019s social role in society defined by professionalism (Robins et al. 2002). In the American Board of Internal Medicine\u2019s Project Professionalism, it states \u201caltruism is the essence of professionalism\u201d (Stobo et al. 1995, p. 5). Medical school admissions committees seek out applicants who they believe will choose altruism as a guiding principle in their careers (Albanese et al. 2003).",

            "text": "These calls to professionalism and altruism by professional societies are in stark contrast to the increasing empathy erosion among medical professionals. It has been questioned whether altruism can even exist in the modern marketplace of medicine. In an editorial, Roger Jones describes \u201ca growing feeling that altruism in medicine, if not dying, is at least declining\u201d (Jones 2002, p. 624). Today\u2019s culture of medicine is considered to be \u201chostile to altruism\u201d (Coulehan 2005, p. 892). Some authors advocate for abandoning altruism in medical education as medicine is a compensated profession, and this financial compensation makes altruism an untenable goal (Burks and Kobus 2012; Glannon and Ross 2002). Glannon and Ross (2002) argue that the most fundamental feature of the medical profession is not altruism, but a fiduciary responsibility to patients in which physicians have an obligation to act in a patient\u2019s best medical interest. They argue that altruism cannot exist in this context of a professional obligation. However, physicians have always received compensation for their services, and the concepts of professional obligation and financial compensation are insufficient to overthrow altruism as a defining feature, ideal, and inspiration in medicine.",

They have less autonomy in the workplace, and they have long clinical hours after which they are studying for exams. They are shuffled from one rotation to the next without a constant peer group. All of these stressors are occurring as they enter a work environment characterized by human suffering and death. Over half of the attending physicians under whom they are training are themselves burned out, thereby limiting their cognitive and emotional energy to be teachers, role models, and mentors.",

Medical school is a self-actualization professional development in which students are learning to serve others by developing their own cognitive, emotional, and procedural skills. Tocqueville describes how enlightened self-interest does not result in great acts of self-sacrifice but rather in smaller, more regular, daily acts of self-sacrifice.

Medical schools can use ESIA to increase volunteers and improve the experience for faculty and students, thereby increasing community outreach. Students should be encouraged to think about how they can benefit from volunteering. When they arrive at the clinic, they should discuss their goals with faculty. After the experience, reflection on the experience may be encouraged by activities such as debriefing with the volunteer team, blogging about their experiences with an optional platform to share blogs with peers, or another creative outlet that encourages personal growth towards becoming a physician and experiencing the joy in serving others.",

The prevalence of burnout and empathy erosion in medical school demands a shift from the culture of self-sacrifice and self-flagellation. ESIA replaces the tension between self-interests and altruism with an alliance. Altruism is itself a self-interest in that it can be uplifting and promote a sense of purpose and well-being. ESIA promotes the intertwined relationship of self-interests and altruism to produce the desirable actions and behaviors in medical students. During a time when the relationship of medicine and altruism seems to be deteriorating, ESIA seeks to serve as bridge. ESIA makes altruism sustainable with the appropriate and guided incorporation of the self-interests.",
