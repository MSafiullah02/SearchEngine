It is caused by an autoimmune response to self-antigens in a genetically susceptible individual induced by unknown environmental factors. Principal cells of the immune system that drive the immunopathological processes are T cells, especially of T H 1 and T H 17 subsets. However, in recent years, it was disclosed that regulatory T cells took part in, too. Subsequently, there was endeavour to develop ways how to reestablish their physiological functions. In this review, we describe known mechanisms of action, efficacy, and side-effects of contemporary and emerging MS immunotherapeutical agents on Treg cells and other cells of the immune system involved in the immunopathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, we discuss how laboratory immunology can offer physicians its help in the diagnosis process and decisions what kind of biological therapy should be used.",

External \"enemies\" are represented mainly by germs; those of internal origin belong especially to potentially malignant cells that appear in our organisms as a result of the breakdown of their replication mechanisms. Another important biological function of the immune system is the prevention of autoreactive T and B cells activation, respectively, which potentially represent a threat of autoimmune diseases induction. To avoid this possibility, mechanisms of recessive (central) and dominant (peripheral) tolerance were developed. Recessive tolerance is based on deletion of autoreactive T and B cells in the thymus or in the bone marrow, respectively, during the process of their maturation in these primary lymphoid organs [1, 2] . Like other biological systems, the mechanisms of the recessive tolerance are not 100% effective, and a part of autoreactive lymphocytes escape their demise and enter the periphery, the secondary lymphoid organs. Here, when they encounter autoantigens, cross-reactive antigens or when a dysregulation of the immune system develops, they can be activated and induce autoimmune processes. Mechanisms of dominant tolerance mediated mainly by regulatory T cells (Treg) prevent this eventuality. By contacting with autoreactive lymphocytes directly or indirectly, especially by synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines, Treg cells prevent their activation or suppress their effector activity [1, 2] .",

It binds DNA and acts as a transcriptional activator/ repressor by recruiting deacetylases as well as histone acetyltransferases. FOXP3 is crucial for the function of the nTreg cells. Humans with mutations in the FOXP3 gene (Xp11. 23-q13 . 3 ) suffer from a severe autoimmune disorder known as IPEX syndrome (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked), which manifests in lymphoproliferation, multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration, and systemic autoimmune inflammation; the disease is incompatible with life [6, 7] . nTreg cells comprise 5-10% of all CD4 + CD8 \u2212 thymocytes and in the periphery they represent approximately 10% out of the whole population of CD4 + T cells. nTreg cells are longliving cells and IL-2 is essential for their peripheral maintenance as proved by its neutralisation, which results in reduction of nTreg cells counts and sensitisation to autoimmunity [8] [9] [10] . They are characterised by several membrane molecules. Characteristically, they express CD4, CD25, CD5, CD49d, CD69, CD103, CD152 (CTLA-4), and CD357 (GITR). More typical signs are low expression of CD127 (alpha chain of IL-7 receptor) and high expression of neuropilin [3, 11] .",

No systemic disease similar to IPEX happens when there is a deficiency of iTreg cells (in experimental animals); however, inflammatory processes of mucosal surfaces develop (colitis, asthma bronchiale) [16] [17] [18] . Initially, iTreg and nTreg cells were difficult to distinguish from one another. The problem was resolved only recently when it was found that iTreg, unlike nTreg, expressed much lower quantities of neuropilin [19] . iTreg cells suppress activities of target cells in a similar way like nTreg cells [4, 15] .",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a characteristic autoimmune disease. In short, MS is characterised by demyelination process in the brain and the spinal cord; the peripheral nervous system is rarely involved. Aetiology of the disease is still unknown, most likely MS occurs because of some combination of genetic, environmental, and infectious agents, among them EBV, CMV, HBV, HSV, human herpetic viruses 6, or 7, measles viruses, coronaviruses, and others. A relationship between viruses and MS is supported by observations that viral infections frequently precede bouts of the disease. It is possible that IFN-, which is produced during the infection, triggers immunopathological events resulting in demyelination [23] . The viruses may possess proteins that resemble the myelin antigens and by the mechanisms of molecular mimicry activate autoreactive T cells. Environmental factors like insufficient supply of vitamin D seem to support MS development [24, 25] . Furthermore, MS prevalence rates may be influenced by the socioeconomic changes in previous decades, which are related to industrialisation, urban living, pollution, occupational exposures to solvents, changes in diet, smoking habits, and so forth. Immunopathological processes start by activation of autoreactive T cells in the periphery; they belong to T H 1, and to T H 17 subsets ( Figure 1 ) [23, 26] . Activated T cells subsequently upregulate the expression of adhesive molecules which enables them to adhere to their counterparts in membranes of endothelial cells of the central nervous system (CNS). LFA-1 and 4 1-integrins in T cells and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells mediate these interactions. VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed and its expression is substantially upregulated by stimulation of cells by cytokines. This mechanism of transmigration into the CNS parenchyma is used mainly by T H 1 cells. T H 17 cells prefer interaction between their chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCL20 ligands, which are also constitutively expressed in small quantities in membranes of endothelial cells [27, 28] . Likewise, B cells migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is mediated by interaction between their CCR7 and CCL19 in the brain [28] . Upon entering the CNS, T cells are reactivated by local and infiltrating antigen presenting cells (i.e. dendritic cells and macrophages), which present peptides originated from myelin by their HLA class II molecules to T cells [29] [30] [31] . The activated T cells migrate into the parenchyma and produce proinflammatory cytokines (esp. IFN-, IL-17), which themselves may damage myelin [26] . However, more importantly, they activate microglial cells, which are thought to be the main cells responsible for lesional and perilesional axon killing. They, by the synthesis of cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, osteopontin), reactive oxygen, and nitrogen intermediate products, further contribute to the damage of myelin sheaths resulting in impaired nerve conduction [26, 30] .",

They produced various cytokines, especially IL-17 and they themselves killed human neurons and promoted central nervous system inflammation through CD4 + lymphocyte recruitment [23, 33, 34] . However, perhaps more important than IL-17 production is their synthesis of GM-CSF. This cytokine supports attraction of monocytes and dendritic cells to the CNS and their activation, the mechanisms by which they contribute to neuroinflammation. GM-CSF furthermore acts as a positive feedback loop whereby it enhances the synthesis of IL-23 from antigen-presenting cells and so further sustains the activation and maturation of T H 17 cells [35] .",

            "text": "MS has been viewed historically as a CD4 + T cellmediated autoimmune disease. However, the frequency of CD8 + T cells is greater than that of T helper cells in inflamed plaques, and CD8 + T cells show oligoclonal expansion in plaques, CSF, and blood which suggests they have a pathogenic role in MS too. Cytotoxic T cells destroy myelin by their perforin-granzyme mechanisms, resulting in the release of other autoantigens and circulus vitiosus continues [23, 36] . Regulatory T cells play a vital role in the regulation of immune processes. Based on the induction of autoimmune processes caused by the FOXP3 gene mutation, it was supposed that defective Treg cells might also contribute to the development of immunopathological processes in \"more common\" autoimmune disorders. This supposition has been confirmed. nTreg cells can contribute to the induction of autoimmunity by their decreased numbers, by the breakdown of their function, or simply by the reality that overactivated autoreactive T cells resist their immunosuppressive activities ( Figure 2 ). The role of Treg cells in MS is rather controversial. While there have been reports on reduced frequency of nTreg cells in MS patients [37, 38] , the majority of studies have found a similar frequency to the one observed in healthy individuals [39, 40] . However, several functional studies using in vitro suppression assays have documented impairments in Treg cells from MS patients [40] [41] [42] [43] . What may be the cause for insufficient activities of nTreg cells in MS patients? It is probably a complex defect, such as reduced expression of coinhibitory molecules (CLTA-4, TIM-3, TIGIT) in their membranes, and insufficient synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines [42, 44] . In this context, an interesting finding was reported by Schneider-Hohendorf et al. They disclosed an impaired migratory activity of Treg cells into the CNS in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) [45] .",

Although inflammation may also affect the brain, the lesions are different from those observed in MS. Unlike standard MS, the attacks are not mediated by the immune system's T cells, but rather by antibodies directed against aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a protein in the cell membranes of astrocytes. However, as antibodies belong to IgG1 class, their production requires T cells [56, 57] .

It was proved to induce, like IFN-, the production of IL-1Ra, a natural inhibitor of IL-1, which results in inhibition of its proinflammatory activities. Furthermore, monocytes/macrophages under the GA activities produce less IL-1 and TNF, that is, the most potent proinflammatory cytokines and IL-12, the cytokine supporting polarisation of na\u00efve T cells into the T H 1 subset (Figure 1 ). On the contrary, it increases the synthesis of immunosuppressive IL-10 [70] . One supposes that GA-activated T cells enter the CNS and develop their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities [71] . GA supports also suppressive activities of Treg cells by the upregulation of their coinhibitory molecules TIGIT and TIM-3 [42, 44, 72] .

This way, natalizumab prevents a transmigration of activated T cells into the CNS because they do not succeed in adhering to endothelial cells; macroscopically, this effect of natalizumab is perceived as lymphocytosis. Regulatory T cells are not affected by natalizumab; it influences neither their number nor function. Natalizumab reduces also the number of dendritic cells in the perivascular environment of the brain, indicating that its activity does not restrict itself to T cells only [74] .",

PML is thought to be caused by reactivation of John Cunningham virus (JCV), primarily in the setting of immunosuppression [77] . Its pathological activity results in oligodendrocyte destruction [78] . An other complication of the natalizumab treatment is the induction of IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), also known as the \"immune recovery syndrome. \" It is observed in some patients recovering from immunosuppression in whom the immune system begins to revive but then responds to a previously acquired opportunistic infections with an overwhelming inflammatory response that paradoxically makes the symptoms of the infection worse [78, 79] . Treg cells, rather induced than natural, probably take part in IRIS induction too because of inappropriate conditions for their induction. Nevertheless, natalizumab holds its position in the MS treatment when a physician considers the risk of the patient to develop PML or IRIS, and when his/her previous immunosuppressive treatment and a positivity of anti-JVC antibodies are taken into account. FTY720 (fingolimod), a derivative of myriocin, a fungal metabolite of the Chinese herb Iscaria sinclarii, is an other second-line immunomodulating drug approved for treating MS. It is a structural analogue of intracellular sphingosine that is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 in vivo. Fingolimod exerts its effect by mimicking sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and the binding to four of five S1P receptors on lymphocytes results in their internalisation and prolonged downregulation. Without signals from S1P receptors, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and B cells are unable to egress from secondary lymphoid tissues, resulting in a marked decrease of these cells in the periphery and their reduced recruitment to sites of inflammation. Approximately 80% of lymphocytes undergoes this reversible sequestration 3-5 hours after fingolimod application [80, 81] .",

The rationale of a decrease of B cells for MS (and other autoimmune disorders) treatment is based on their other functions, not only those connected with production of antibodies. B cells belong to antigen-presenting cells too. They express HLA class II molecules, and engulfed protein antigens, previously bound to their immunoglobulin receptors, are then subsequently processed and bound to their grooves. The presentation of the \"HLA-molecule-peptide\" complex to T cells follows and by receiving costimulatory signals, T cells are activated [86, 87] . By destruction of B lymphocytes, anti-CD20 mAb reduce their number and so downregulate their ability to interact with autoreactive T cells, which results in attenuation of autoimmune processes. Concurrently, a cytokine profile in the microenvironment is changing in support of the induction and expansion of Treg cells [20, 88, 89] . Why was the CD20 molecule selected? The answer is relatively easy: CD20 is expressed on B cell lineage from the pre-B cell stage to the memory B cell stage, but not on plasma cells [90] .",

Because the high-affinity IL-2 receptor signalling promotes the expansion of activated T cells in vitro, daclizumab was designed as a therapy that selectively inhibits T-cell activation and received approval as an add-on therapy to a standard immunosuppressive regimen for the prevention of acute allograft rejection in renal transplantation. Based on its mechanism of action, daclizumab represented an ideal therapy for T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases too and was subsequently tested in the treatment of inflammatory uveitis and MS. In both of them, it significantly inhibited target organ inflammation. Subsequent studies of mechanisms of its action in MS resulted rather in a surprise; instead of inhibition of T-cell proliferation and production of cytokines, it was shown it had expanded and activated Mediators of Inflammation 7 immunoregulatory CD56 bright NK cells, which gained access to the brain parenchyma and killed autologous activated T cells [100, 101] .",

Treg cells could block both the initiation of autoimmune responses and inhibit the function of established autoreactive effector cells. The system was successfully tested in the EAE model of MS. The studies have disclosed that transfer of MBP-reactive Treg cells prevented disease when given prior to immunisation and prevented relapses when administered after the onset of disease. The effect was seen only when relevant myelin antigen-specific Treg cells were transferred, but not with polyclonal Treg cells [46, 103] . This could represent a stumbling block to the possible use of Treg therapy in MS, where the relevant antigens are not well defined.",

            "text": "In recent years, we are witnesses of a substantial increase of our knowledge on particular immunopathological processes in MS, which has reflected in a better and more effective therapy that we shortly outlined in the previous paragraphs. However, there is still a question, which laboratory indicators should be taken into considerations when physicians are thinking over what type of treatment would fit best to a particular MS patient. The followup of particular population of T cells and their subsets in the peripheral blood surely informs a physician about response of the immune system to the therapy. For instance, level of expansion of CD56 bright NK cells and the decrease in ratios of T cells (as target cells) to CD56 bright NK cells (as effector cells) could represent a useful biomarker indicative of therapeutic response to daclizumab. However, our current knowledge of the great plasticity of T helper cells subsets and their ability of redifferentiation from one subset to another (e.g., T H 2 to T H 1, etc.) [104] will make us pay more attention to cytokines. If a cytokine profile is more tilted to a proinflammatory on the expense of an antiinflammatory, it will indicate that the pathological process is more intensive and our therapy is less efficient. For instance, the ratio between anti-inflammatory IL-10 and proinflammatory IL-12 correlates with the disease activity, for example, if patients respond to the IFN-treatment, the IL-10 to IL-12 ratio increases [105] . The monitoring of levels of some adhesive and costimulatory molecules (VLA-4, LFA-1, VCAM-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3) follows the same objective. For instance, if an MS patient responds to IFN-treatment, the levels of his/her adhesive molecules in the peripheral blood are decreasing [105] . How to treat it, when to change the therapy, and whether a drug combination should be used still remain upon the physician's discretion. Furthermore, MS is not a uniform disease; on the contrary, it has its own subtle differences based on the predominance of one type of immunopathological process over the other, which prevails differently in every MS patient.",

T helper lymphocytes leaving the thymus (na\u00efve or T H 0)are not yet fully differentiated to perform their specific functions in peripheral lymphoid tissues. They are endowed of these properties in the process of their interactions with dendritic cells (DCs) that engulf, process, and present antigens to them. Moreover, DCs in dependence of the processed antigens produce different cytokines. If DCs produce IL-12, na\u00efve T cells polarise into the T H 1 subset, if IL-4 into the T H 2 subset and eventually, if DCs synthesise IL-6, na\u00efve T helper cells will become the T H 17 cells.",

Failures of regulatory T (Treg) cell-mediated regulation can include: inadequate numbers of Treg cells owing to their inadequate development in the thymus, for example, due to a shortage of principal cytokines (IL-2, TGF-) or costimulatory signals (CD28), and so forth. Further, the number of Treg cells can be in a physiological range; however, there are some defects in Treg-cell function that are intrinsic to Treg cells, for example, they do not synthesise sufficient quantity of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-), or there is a breakdown of their interaction with effector T cells. Ultimately, pathogenic effector T cells (Teff) are resistant to suppression by Treg cells owing to factors that are intrinsic to the effector cells or factors that are present in the inflammatory milieu that supports effector T cells resistance.",
