Routine COVID-19 testing was implemented during this time period. 52 Testing was performed for all admitted patients, regardless of indication for admission or 53 presence of symptoms. IRB approval was obtained, as well as approval by a COVID-19 specific 54 research committee within our institution. The study was performed at NYU Winthrop Hospital 55 of the NYU Langone Health System; our hospital performs approximately 4,800 deliveries per 56 year. 57 All women were asked about symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath). The 58 presence of 1 or more of the aforementioned symptoms was used to determine if the patient 59 was symptomatic. Sampling was performed by a resident physician or physician assistant in 60 appropriate PPE using a nasal swab in a negative pressure room with closed doors. Each 61 nasopharyngeal swab was collected in the GeneXPert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for 62 Viruses (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and transferred to the laboratory. Within the negative 63 pressure fume hood, 30 mL of viral culture media from the collection kit was transferred into 64 the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). The cartridge was 4 subsequently placed in Cepheid's equipment for polymerase chain reaction. 6 (Cepheid, 66 Sunnyvale, CA). The PCR test takes approximately 45 minutes. The result was scored as 67 \"positive\" or \"negative.\" Viral testing was also performed in all neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 68 positive mothers. Results were used in clinical management to triage patients, guide PPE use, 69 and oversee the appropriate maternal/neonatal cohorting of patients. The accuracy of maternal 70 symptomatology to predict the COVID-19 infection was tested by constructing a 2x2table and 71calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive 72 likelihood ratio (sensitivity/1-specificity), and negative likelihood ratio (1-sensitivity/specificity)of 161 patients underwent routine COVID-19 testing on admission to L&D. Age 76 ranged 15 to 42 with a mean age of 31. There were 70 nulliparous women (43.4%) and 91 77 multiparous women (56.6%); 47.2% of women were Caucasian, 23.0% were Hispanic, 16.8% 78",

This approach 103 ensures that SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers are accurately identified and triaged.
