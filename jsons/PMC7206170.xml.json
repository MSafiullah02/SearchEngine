To respond to this demand, many vulnerability detection systems and methods, ranging from open source to commercial tools, and from manual to automatic methods have been proposed and implemented. Most of the previous works in software vulnerability detection (SVD) [1, 8] have been developed based on handcrafted features which are manually chosen by knowledgeable domain experts who may have outdated experience and underlying biases. In many situations, handcrafted features normally do not generalize well. For example, features that work well in a certain software project may not perform well in other projects. To alleviate the dependency on handcrafted features, the use of automatic features in SVD has been studied recently [11\u201313]. These works have shown the advantages of automatic features over handcrafted features in the context of software vulnerability detection.",

            "text": "However, most of these approaches lead to another crucial issue in SVD research, namely the scarcity of labeled projects. Labelled vulnerable code is needed to train these models, and the process of labeling vulnerable source code is very tedious, time-consuming, error-prone, and challenging even for domain experts. This has led to few labeled projects compared with the vast volume of unlabeled ones. A viable solution is to apply transfer learning or domain adaptation which aims to devise automated methods that make it possible to transfer a learned model from the source domain with labels to the target domains without labels. Studies in domain adaptation can be broadly categorized into two themes: shallow [6] and deep domain adaptations [3, 14, 18]. These recent studies have shown the advantages of deep over shallow domain adaptation (i.e., higher predictive performance and capacity to tackle structural data). Deep domain adaptation encourages the learning of new representations for both source and target data in order to minimize the divergence between them [3, 14, 18]. The general idea is to map source and target data to a joint feature space via a generator, where the discrepancy between the source and target distributions is reduced. Notably, the work of [3, 18] employed generative adversarial networks (GANs) [4] to close the gap between source and target data in the joint space. However, most of aforementioned works mainly focus on transfer learning in the computer vision domain. The work of [16] is the first work which applies deep domain adaptation to SVD with promising predictive performance on real-world source code projects. The underlying idea is to employ the GAN to close the gap between the source and target domains in the joint space and enforce the clustering assumption [2] to utilize the information carried in the unlabeled target samples in a semi-supervised context.",

In particular, the study in [17] recently studied the mode collapsing problem and further classified this into the missing mode problem i.e., the generated samples miss some modes in the true data, and the boundary distortion problem i.e., the generated samples can only partly recover some modes in the true data. It is certain that deep domain adaptation approaches that use the GAN principle will inherently encounter both the missing mode and boundary distortion problems. Last but not least, deep domain adaptation approaches using the GAN principle also face the data distortion problem. The representations of source and target examples in the joint feature space degenerate to very small regions that cannot preserve the manifold/clustering structure in the original space.",

Our two approaches are: i) apply manifold regularization for enabling the preservation of manifold/clustering structures in the joint feature space, hence avoiding the degeneration of source and target data in this space; and ii) invoke dual discriminators in an elegant way to reduce the negative impacts of the missing mode and boundary distortion problems in deep domain adaptation using the GAN principle as mentioned before. We name our mechanism when applied to SVD as Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN). We empirically demonstrate that our Dual-GD-DDAN can overcome the missing mode and boundary distortion problems which is likely to happen as in Deep Code Domain Adaptation (DDAN) [16] in which the GAN was solely applied to close the gap between the source and target domains in the joint space (see the discussion in Sects. 2.3 and 3.3, and the visualization in Fig. 3). In addition, we incorporate the relevant approaches \u2013 minimizing the conditional entropy and manifold regularization with spectral graph \u2013 proposed in [16] to enforce the clustering assumption [2] and arrive at a new model named Dual Generator-Discriminator Semi-supervised Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-SDDAN). We further demonstrate that our Dual-GD-SDDAN can overcome the mode collapsing problem better than SCDAN in [16], hence obtaining better predictive performance.",

Our experimental results show that our proposed methods are able to overcome the negative impact of the missing mode and boundary distortion problems inherent in deep domain adaptation approaches when solely using the GAN principle as in DDAN and SCDAN [16]. In addition, our method outperforms the rival baselines in terms of predictive performance by a wide margin.",

First, the data distortion problem (i.e., the source and target data in the joint space might collapse into small regions) may occur since there is no mechanism in DDAN to circumvent this. Second, since DDAN is based on the GAN approach, DDAN might suffer from the mode collapsing problem [5, 17]. In particular, [17] has recently studied the mode collapsing problem of GANs and discovered that they are also subject to i) the missing mode problem (i.e., in the joint space, either the target data misses some modes in the source data or vice versa) and ii) the boundary distortion problem (i.e., in the joint space either the target data partly covers the source data or vice versa), which makes the target distribution significantly diverge from the source distribution. As shown in Fig. 1, both the missing mode and boundary distortion problems simultaneously happen since the target distribution misses source mode 2, while the source distribution can only partly cover the target mode 2 in the target distribution and the target distribution can only partly cover the source mode 1 in the source distribution.",

We then measure the difference of the corresponding accuracies as a means of measuring the severity of the boundary distortion. We choose to conduct such a boundary distortion analysis for two pairs of the source (FFmpeg and Pidgin) and target (LibPNG) domains. As shown in Table 2, all gaps obtained by our Dual-GD-DDAN are always smaller than those obtained by DDAN, while the accuracies obtained by our proposed method are always larger. We can therefore conclude that our Dual-GD-DDAN method produces a better representation for source and target samples in the joint space and is less susceptible to boundary distortion compared with the DDAN method.",

As shown in Fig. 3,with undertaking domain adaptation (DDAN, the left figure) and dual-domain adaptation (Dual-GD-DDAN, the right figure), the source and target data sampled are intermingled especially for Dual-GD-DDAN. However, it can be observed that DDAN when solely applying the GAN is seriously vulnerable to the boundary distortion issue. In particular, in the clusters/data modes 2, 3 and 4 (the left figure), the boundary distortion issue occurs since the blue data only partly cover the corresponding red ones (i.e., the source and target data do not totally mix up). Meanwhile, for our Dual-GD-DDAN, the boundary distortion issue is much less vulnerable, and the mixing-up level of source and target data is significantly higher in each cluster/data mode.\n",

For example, to the case of the source domain (VLC) and target domain (LibPNG), our Dual-GD-SDDAN achieves an F1-measure of 76.19% compared with an F1-measure of 72.73% obtained with SCDAN. These results further demonstrate the ability of our Dual-GD-SDDAN for dealing with the mode collapsing problem better than SCDAN [16], hence obtaining better predictive performance in the context of software domain adaptation.\n",

We conducted experiments to compare our Dual-GD-DDAN method with the state-of-the-art baselines.
