TRM cells share many properties with effector-memory T cells (TEM cells), including genetic architecture poised for cytokine production and robust cytolytic activity2,4. Despite these functional similarities, TRM cells are defined by a unique core transcriptional signature that supports long-term tissue residence through the regulation of cell-trafficking molecules and adaptations that enable survival in the tissue microenvironment5,6. These adaptations allow for long-term protection by TRM cells in sites such as the skin and gut, where they can provide almost sterilizing immunity when present in sufficient numbers1,3. In contrast, the efficacy of cellular immunity against respiratory pathogens gradually wanes, and this decline is associated with the progressive loss of virus-specific TRM cells in the lung7,8. However, the mechanisms driving the transient nature of lung TRM cells are not well defined.",

Evidence from animal models and humans indicates that memory CD8+ T cells confer protective immunity to respiratory viruses by substantially decreasing viral loads, limiting immunopathology and lowering disease burden7,8,12\u201314. The lung CD8+ TRM cell pool comprises two distinct populations: airway TRM (A-TRM) cells and interstitial TRM (I-TRM) cells, with unique functional properties. A-TRM cells are poorly cytolytic compared with I-TRM cells, yet are sufficient to protect against influenza challenge through the rapid production of antiviral cytokines15. In addition, the number of A-TRM cells correlates with the efficacy of cellular immune protection in the lung8. These findings have raised questions about the requirements for differentiation and maintenance of these distinct populations of lung TRM cells, and about how environmental niches shape the function and lifespan of these cells, but the molecular underpinnings of differences between A-TRM and I-TRM cells have not been explored to date.",

However, TRM cells in the lung and other barrier tissues have a consistent transcriptional profile, raising questions as to why the lifespan of TRM cells would vary between tissues6,17\u201319. One potential explanation for these conflicting findings is that lung TRM cells have often been investigated as a single population, without separation into A-TRM and I-TRM cell subsets. Given the functional differences between these subsets and the distinct environments where they reside, a detailed comparison of A-TRM and I-TRM cells could be informative about the mechanisms that control their biology and regulate the decline of lung TRM cells.",

We observed that A-TRM and I-TRM subsets were gradually lost due to apoptosis in the tissue, and transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis (ATAC) revealed an enrichment of genes in A-TRM cells associated with the integrated stress response (ISR), notably the amino acid starvation pathway. These stress-related programs were due to the airway environment, whereas core TRM signature genes were regulated during the initial differentiation of A-TRM cells after infection. Overall, these findings provide new insight into the role of environmental cues in controlling the differential functions and lifespan of A-TRM and I-TRM cells, and identify pathways that may be manipulated to improve the longevity of cellular immunity against respiratory pathogens.",

The PR8-challenged mice showed progressively more weight loss (Fig. 1a) and decreased survival (Fig. 1b) as time from the initial infection with x31 increased. To determine the kinetics of the loss of flu-specific A-TRM and I-TRM cells in the lung, we analyzed the number of influenza nucleoprotein (FluNP)+ and acid polymerase (FluPA)+ CD8+ T cells on days 8, 10, 14, 21, 35, 60, 90 and 180 post-infection in the lung airways (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)), lung interstitium and spleen using intravital labeling, which allows for the identification of extravascular T cells in the tissue by gating on IV\u2212CD8+ T cells (negative for staining with the intravital antibody). Tissue-resident, FluNP+, memory CD8+ T cells were present in both the lung airways and the interstitium 35 d post-x31 infection (Fig. 1c). Regardless of specificity, the number of CD8+IV\u2212 A-TRM cells and CD8+IV\u2212 I-TRM cells gradually declined from day 35 to day 180 post-infection, whereas the number of splenic effector, memory CD8+CD62L\u2212 T cells (S-TEM) remained mostly unchanged (Fig. 1d,e). We observed a similar trend after infection with Sendai virus (see Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that the effect was not specific to influenza virus. A-TRM cells were lost much more rapidly than I-TRM cells, declining almost 100-fold by 6 months post-infection compared with 40-fold for I-TRM cells (Fig. 1f,g). These data indicated that A-TRM and I-TRM cells were lost over 6 months post-infection, with a more accelerated decline of the A-TRM cells.",

To test whether the gradual loss of circulating CD62L\u2212 TEM cells contributed to the loss of lung TRM cells, we measured the number of S-TEM cells after x31 influenza infection. There was a modest decrease in the number of FluNP+ S-TEM cells between 1 and 6 months post-infection in wild-type mice (see Supplementary Fig. 2), similar to previous reports20. CD69+CD103\u2212 and CD69+CD103+ FluNP+ I-TRM cells declined notably faster than FluNP+ S-TEM cells between 1 and 6 months post-infection (see Supplementary Fig. 2c). In contrast, CD69\u2212CD103\u2212CD8+ FluNP+IV\u2212 T cells in the lung, which were probably transiting TEM cells, declined at the same rate as S-TEM cells (see Supplementary Fig. 2c), indicating that the decline of lung TRM cells did not coincide with the gradual loss of S-TEM cells.",

Analysis of CD69 and CD103 expression on FluNP+ I-TRM cells found that >95% of CD69+CD103\u2212 and CD69+CD103+ cells were host derived (Fig. 2e).

We also observed an important increase in AnnexinV+ cells among CD69+ A-TRM cells compared with CD69+ I-TRM cells (Fig. 2h).

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 9,362 genes detected indicated that I-TRM cells more closely aligned with S-TEM cells than with A-TRM cells (Fig. 3b). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, absolute log2(fold change) (log2(FC)) > 1) indicated that each population had a distinct expression profile, with A-TRM cells being the most transcriptionally distinct (Fig. 3c). We correlated the change in expression for genes differentially expressed between A-TRM and S-TEM cells, or between A-TRM and I-TRM cells, and identified gene expression changes unique to each comparison (for example, Itgae, Ctla4), as well as shared differences (for example, Klrg1, Asns) (Fig. 3d). DEGs upregulated in airway TRM cells included genes involved in amino acid transport (Slc1a4, Slc7a5) and amino acid synthesis (Asns, Lars), whereas DEGs shared by A-TRM and I-TRM cells included genes associated with programming of TRM cells (Itga1, Itgae, Ahr) (Fig. 3d). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)21 identified a notable positive enrichment in genes associated with the unfolded protein response in A-TRM cells compared with both I-TRM and S-TEM cells (Fig. 3e), suggesting stresses unique to the airway and not present in the lung interstitium or spleen. A-TRM cells were also negatively enriched for genes involved in the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pathway, including Prf1, Gzma, Gzmb and Gzmk (Fig. 3e), which supported previous reports that A-TRM cells are poorly cytolytic15. In addition, A-TRM cells showed altered expression of DEGs related to intrinsic cell death, maintenance of cell survival under cell stress and activation of the ISR, including Dusp1, Bax, Bcl2, Bbc3, Pim2 and the proapoptotic transcription factor Ddit3 (Fig. 3f). However, A-TRM and I-TRM cells shared the expression of a core set of known TRM genes, including Itgae, Cdh1, Ahr, Cxcr6, Klf2 and S1p1r6,18 (Fig. 3f). To confirm the RNA-seq findings, we performed a second analysis using FluNP+CD8+ T cells sorted from three independent cohorts of wild-type mice 35 d after x31 infection, which included FluNP+IV+CD8+ TEM cells from the lung vasculature, in addition to FluNP+ A-TRM, I-TRM and S-TEM cells, to address whether processing of the lung tissue impacted the genetic signature of I-TRM cells. Data from this additional analysis showed a similar pattern of gene expression to the original analysis, and indicated that FluNP+ I-TRM cells and lung vascular TEM cells had unique transcriptional signatures (see Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, staining for BCL2 protein indicated that BCL2 was notably upregulated in A-TRM cells compared with I-TRM cells (see Supplementary Fig. 4). These data indicated that A-TRM cells had a distinct transcriptional profile, characterized by cellular stress and balancing of pro- and antiapoptotic signals compared with I-TRM cells,, and suggested that the local microenvironment had a critical role in regulating TRM cell biology.",

The PCA of 47,683 accessible loci indicated that A-TRM cells clustered separately from I-TRM and S-TEM cells (Fig. 4a). These differences were not due to tissue processing and were consistent in three independent cohorts of wild-type mice that had been infected with x31 35 d earlier (see Supplementary Fig. 3). We identified differentially accessible regions (DARs) (FDR < 0.05, absolute log2(FC) > 1) between each TRM cell subset (Fig. 4b), and integrated them with the RNA-seq data to determine coordinated changes in the epigenome and transcriptome for each TRM cell subset26. Using k-means clustering, we observed three distinct patterns (k1\u2013k3) in the data that could be mapped to each of the cell types: k1 in S-TEM cells, k2 in I-TRM cells and k3 in A-TRM cells (Fig. 4c). This analysis indicated that A-TRM cells had a unique chromatin accessibility landscape compared with I-TRM and S-TEM cells, which resulted in coordinated changes in gene expression and suggested that the epigenetic architecture of A-TRM cells may be impacted by their environment.",

The A-TRM pattern (k3) was enriched for genes implicated in cellular homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, hypoxia and glucose starvation (Fig. 4f). The extrinsic apoptosis pathway was uniquely enriched in I-TRM cells (k2, Fig. 4f), which might explain the increased apoptosis in these cells compared with S-TEM cells. Slc7a5 and Asns, which encode an amino acid transporter and asparagine synthetase, respectively, contained DARs with increased accessibility and were more highly expressed in A-TRM cells compared with I-TRM and S-TEM cells (Fig. 4g), suggesting differential epigenetic and transcriptional programming of pathways related to cell stress and apoptosis in A-TRM cells. These data suggest that the local environments of the airways and interstitium contribute to differential epigenetic programming in lung TRM cell subsets.",

Different stressors activate unique pathways to restore cellular homeostasis28. To determine the pathway responsible for the gradual loss of A-TRM cells, we analyzed genes known to be involved in responses to cellular stress that were differentially expressed in A-TRM cells. Most transcripts upregulated in A-TRM cells were involved in amino acid transport (Slc25a22, Slc1a4, Slc7a5), amino acid synthesis (Mars, Lars, Sars, Aars, Asns), recognition of uncharged transfer RNAs (Eif2ak4), cell cycle arrest (Cdkn1a) and proapoptotic transcriptional regulation in response to stress (Ddit3) (Fig. 5a), suggesting that amino acid starvation could be the primary trigger for activation of the ISR in A-TRM cells28. GSEA indicated that gene sets involved in intrinsic apoptotic signaling, in response to ER stress and amino acid transport, were highly enriched in A-TRM cells compared with I-TRM and S-TEM cells (Fig. 5b), suggesting ISR activation and amino acid starvation in these cells. To further investigate the impact of the airway environment in the amino acid stress response, we assessed the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter CD98, a heterodimer of Slc7a5 and Slc3a2 (ref. 29), in combination with CD11a, which is highly expressed on memory CD8+ T cells, but is downregulated within 36 h of entry into the airways30, on FluNP+ A-TRM, I-TRM and S-TEM cells 35 d post-influenza infection. A-TRM cells expressed more CD98 compared with I-TRM and S-TEM cells (Fig. 5c,d). Furthermore, increased expression of CD98 on A-TRM cells was limited to CD11alo cells (Fig. 5d), indicating that upregulation of CD98 occurred after entry into the airway environment. To address whether the airway environment was sufficient to drive upregulation of CD98 on memory CD8+ T cells, we transferred, intratracheally, S-TEM cells, from wild-type mice infected with x31 30 d earlier, into naive, congenic, wild-type recipient mice. Expression of CD98 on transferred S-TEM cells was notably increased 4 d post-intratracheal (i.t.) transfer compared with S-TEM cells pre-transfer (Fig. 5e). In addition, expression of CD98 on S-TEM cells transferred into the airways steadily increased between day 1 and day 8 post-i.t. transfer (Fig. 5f), suggesting that CD98 expression correlated with the length of time that memory CD8+ T cells were in the airway environment.",

Chimeric mice generated by co-injecting wild-type and Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow cells into congenic mice were infected with influenza x31 8 weeks post-transfer. The number of FluNP+ A-TRM, I-TRM and S-TEM cells was determined at the peak of acute infection (day 10) and after establishment of T cell memory (day 60). The ratio of wild-type to Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 FluNP+ A-TRM and I-TRM cells (normalized to the ratio of wild-type to Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 FluNP+ S-TEM cells in each mouse) showed no differences (Fig. 5h), indicating that Ddit3 deficiency did not rescue the accumulation of FluNP+ A-TRM cells. However, the dynamic balance between cell death and cell recruitment that regulates the number of A-TRM cells made it difficult to accurately define whether expression of Ddit3 impacted the survival of memory CD8+ T cells in the airway. Thus, to assess cell survival in the absence of cell recruitment to the airways, we sorted S-TEM cells from the spleens of congenic wild-type CD45.1+ and Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with x31 35 d earlier, and transferred them intratracheally in equal mixes into wild-type CD45.1+CD45.2+ recipients infected with x31 35 d earlier; 3 d post-transfer, the ratio of wild-type S-TEM cells to Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 S-TEM cells in the airways was notably biased toward Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 S-TEM cells (Fig. 5i), indicating increased survival of Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 S-TEM cells in the airways compared with wild-type S-TEM cells. To address whether deletion of Ddit3 impacted cellular immunity, A-TRM cells from wild-type or Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 mice, infected with x31 35 d earlier, were transferred intratracheally into the airways of naive hosts before challenge with PR8 influenza 1 d post-transfer. Viral titers were similar between mice that received wild-type or Ddit3\u2212/\u2212 A-TRM cells on day 4 post-challenge (see Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that expression of Ddit3 did not alter the protective functions of A-TRM cells. Thus, the airway environment affected TRM cell biology and suggested that amino acid starvation contributed to the gradual loss of the A-TRM cells.",

Comparison of RNA-seq on CD45.2+ S-TEM cells, isolated on day 2 post-i.t. transfer from post-i.t. acute mice or post-i.t. memory mice, found over 400 DEGs (Fig. 6c).

Analysis of gene expression from pre-transfer, post-i.t. memory, post-i.t. acute and post-i.p.

Expression of the amino acid transporter CD98 was higher on post-i.t. memory S-TEM cells compared with post-i.p. and post-i.t. acute S-TEM cells (Fig. 6e), confirming the RNA-seq results. Thus, the airway microenvironment could drive activation of the amino acid stress response pathway in S-TEM cells at steady state, but did not do so during infection.",

A number of genes associated with amino acid starvation, such as Slc7a5, Asns and Myc, were upregulated in both A-TRM cells and post-i.t. transfer S-TEM cells, whereas known TRM genes such as Itgae and Itga1 were upregulated only in A-TRM cells, but not post-i.t. transfer S-TEM cells, and independent of the tissue environment (Fig. 7a). Comparisons of select DEGs across A-TRM, I-TRM, S-TEM, and pre- and post-i.t. transfer S-TEM cells indicated that, although DEGs associated with cell stress (Aars and Slc7a5) or lack of CTL activity (Gzmb) were observed only in A-TRM cells and post-i.t. transfer S-TEM cells exposed to the airway environment, known TRM genes (Itgae, Itga1 and Cxcr6) were similarly differentially expressed in A-TRM cells and I-TRM cells compared with S-TEM cells and pre- and post-i.t. transfer S-TEM cells (Fig. 7b). These data indicated that the program linked to lung TRM cell differentiation was shared between A-TRM and I-TRM cells, with subsequent differences in gene expression being driven by adaptations to the local environment.",

DEGs from in vitro A-TRM cells were grouped in three clusters, and GO analyses indicated processes involved in apoptosis, tRNA charging and responses to ER stress being notably altered in A-TRM cells after in vitro culture (Fig. 7d). Genes related to the ISR (Slc7a5, Slc3a2, Ddit3, Sars, Aars and Bbc3)34 were downregulated in A-TRM cells cultured in a nutrient-rich environment compared with A-TRM cells isolated directly from the airways (Fig. 7f,g), indicating that this pathway was reversible and driven by the local microenvironment.

A-TRM cells showed increased apoptosis, decreased expression of cytolytic genes and a transcriptional signature indicative of increased cellular stress due to amino acid starvation. Comparisons of naturally generated A-TRM cells and S-TEM cells transferred into the airways indicated that expression of core TRM genes was largely unaffected by the environment, and was instead regulated during initial TRM cell differentiation after viral clearance. Thus, the lung CD8+ TRM pool comprised functionally and genetically distinct A-TRM and I-TRM cell populations that shared a common TRM cell differentiation program, but were further shaped by their respective microenvironments.",

The waning of the A-TRM cell pool over time had suggested that the source of these newly recruited cells must also be similarly transient, but whether these cells come predominantly from the circulation or from within the tissue remained unclear. Our parabiosis experiments in mice previously exposed to influenza virus indicated that A-TRM and I-TRM cells were not maintained by recruitment of circulating cells into the lung TRM cell pool, which agrees with recent reports that antigen encounter in the pulmonary environment, and not simply entry into the lung tissue itself, is required for TRM cell differentiation14,36,37. These data are in contrast to a study showing that circulating TEM cells were able to re-seed the lung TRM cell pool16. The observation that lung TRM cells could develop independently of pulmonary antigen encounter under specific inflammatory conditions may explain this discrepancy38. Thus, there may be scenarios where circulating TEM cells can convert into lung TRM cells, but further investigation is required to define these antigen-independent mechanisms.",

In contrast, the nutrient-poor conditions in the airway during homeostasis may serve as a brake on CTL activity to avoid unnecessary damage to the epithelium. Notably, this nutrient-poor environment does not influence the secretion of antiviral cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3, which is critical for the protection mediated by A-TRM cells15.
