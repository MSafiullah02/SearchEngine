The details of the seasonal studies have been reported elsewhere [2, 3]. Briefly, patients with ARI were recruited during each influenza season in primary care clinics, urgent care, emergency department, and an acute care hospital. Symptom eligibility criteria varied by season but included fever/feverishness or cough during most seasons. Individuals with illness duration \u226510 days (2004\u20132005 through 2006\u20132007) or >7 days (2007\u20132008 through 2009\u20132010) were excluded to minimize false negative RT-PCR results. After obtaining informed consent, a nasal swab (children <12 years old) or a nasopharyngeal swab (adolescents and adults) was obtained and placed in viral transport media for influenza testing. Symptoms and onset date were assessed during the enrollment interview. Real-time RT-PCR was performed each season to identify influenza cases. After testing was complete, aliquots of samples in viral transport media were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C.",

In 2008, a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness in Australian children 6 to 59 months old found that influenza vaccination was associated with detection of other respiratory viruses [15]. Nasal swabs from 289 children were tested by RT-PCR for influenza, rhinoviruses, RSV, parainfluenza virus 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus, and enteroviruses. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 58% (95% CI, 9\u201381) using influenza-negative controls and 68% (95% CI, 26\u201386) using other virus-positive controls. The authors noted the higher point estimate of vaccine effectiveness using virus-positive controls, although there was substantial overlap in the confidence intervals for these 2 point estimates. The authors speculated that the difference between point estimates could be due to false negative RT-PCR tests in some children (ie, pan-negative controls) due to inadequate sample collection. They also mentioned the possibility that influenza vaccination could increase the risk of infection with other viruses, but they viewed this as biologically implausible.",

In that study, TIV recipients (n = 69) had a 4-fold increase in risk of infection with noninfluenza respiratory viruses, compared to placebo recipients (n = 46); the incidence of seasonal influenza did not differ significantly between the TIV and placebo groups. The authors acknowledged that the association with noninfluenza viruses could be spurious, but they suggested that \u2018receipt of TIV could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism\u2019 [7]. They identified temporary nonspecific immunity as a possible explanation for this observation. According to this proposed mechanism, unvaccinated children were more likely to acquire influenza infection, and the resulting innate immune response provided temporary, nonspecific protection against infection with other respiratory viruses. This was described further in a letter that raised concerns about bias in studies of vaccine effectiveness that use RT-PCR confirmed cases and influenza-negative controls [8].",

However, one of the studies was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a study design that is less susceptible to bias and confounding compared to observational studies. We were unable to replicate the previously reported association in children or adults with a larger sample size over multiple influenza seasons. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that vaccination may alter susceptibility to non-influenza viruses in some circumstances. There is limited biological evidence to support an effect of nonspecific immunity across virus families or species and limited evidence to support the role of vaccination in such immunity. Cross-reactivity of the T-cell response has been described before for different subtypes of influenza A [16\u201318], although cross-reactivity generated by the innate immune system likely lasts only 10\u201314 days [19] and may not apply to interactions between viruses of different families or species. Other researchers have also suggested that outbreaks of different respiratory viruses may interact or interfere with each other on a population level [20\u201322]. This mechanism may help to explain effects not seen in our analysis but which have been reported elsewhere [7, 8].",

Further research may aid in determining the biological plausibility of temporary nonspecific immunity generated by infection with specific respiratory viruses. Finally, we found no difference in vaccine effectiveness estimates using test-negative vs other virus-positive control groups. The results of this analysis strongly support the validity of case vs test-negative control study designs that are currently used in multiple countries to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness in the outpatient setting.",
