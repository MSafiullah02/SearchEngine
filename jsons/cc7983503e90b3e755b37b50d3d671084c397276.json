The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, chest CT findings, and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. 2 However, the shortage of RT-PCR test kits and the prolonged detection time limit its application in emergency circumstances. The present article describes the diagnosis and treatment of four patients with suspected COVID-19 who required urgent surgical intervention for acute abdomen. March 23 rd , 2020, four acute abdomen patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were admitted to our hospital: cases 1 and 2 showed signs of acute peritonitis, while chest CT and radiographic examinations in cases 3 and 4 indicated gastrointestinal perforation and acute peritonitis as well. Moreover, all four patients presented pulmonary opacifications or infiltrations in the lung lobes on chest CT while three of them showed symptoms/signs of pneumonia. Given the epidemiological history was unclear and the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, 3-5 the risk of COVID-19 could not be totally ruled out in these patients.",

In all four of the present cases, exploratory laparotomy was chosen instead of laparoscopic procedures due to the manageable operation time and the uncertainty of airborne and aerosol transmission risk. And we suggested that surgeons who plan to perform minimally invasive procedures need pay more attention to the establishment and removal of artificial pneumoperitoneum, and any air leakage from the trocar sites as well. 8 (5) Wearing full PPE can be quite uncomfortable, and performing surgery under such conditions may be more challenging and technically demanding than usual.
