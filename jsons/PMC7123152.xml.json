Rodents are the most important reservoir for transmission. Commonly carried by the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), the virus is excreted through urine of the rat or other infected animal and contracted by contact with mucosal surfaces or skin breaks [1]. It is most commonly seen in tropical areas subject to poverty, large rainfall, and flooding; however, cases do occur within the United States, particularly the South Pacific coastal states and Hawaii [2]. The organism can infect many types of mammals which can be either asymptomatic or fatal. Spontaneous abortion is a common complication in animals and frequently described in cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. Risk factors for acquiring leptospirosis infection include activities with exposure to infected animals or water. Farmers and animal caretakers are at particular risk. Sporadic outbreaks commonly occur and have been described in athletes participating in triathlons who swam in infected water [3\u20136].",

While tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are effective treatments, doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice for rickettsial infections (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-75623-3_16), and adults should receive 100 mg twice daily. In children, doxycycline is still the recommended agent of choice regardless of age. The recommended dosing of doxycycline in children is 4 mg/kg daily divided into two doses to be received every 12 h. Of note, fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol may also be used but appear to be less efficacious. In addition, fluoroquinolones should not be used in children under the age of 18 years. While duration of therapy is controversial, some sources recommend treatment until 3 days after defervescence, and evidence of clinical improvement is documented. In addition, it should be noted that most individuals will recover from illness within 2 weeks without treatment [51, 52, 56].",
