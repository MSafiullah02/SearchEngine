NoV symptomatic infection causes vomiting, watery diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, fever and general malaise. Gastroenteritis induced by NoV is self-limiting and rarely fatal. Fatality in children and the elderly is usually caused by severe dehydration after NoV infection [2, 6, 7] . further subdivided into clusters, each categorized with a number and the name of the prototype strain. Each cluster is comprised of individual strains identified from various outbreaks and human and animal infections. GI, GII, and GIV affect humans, and currently there are 8 clusters for GI, and 17 clusters for GII [8] . It is not possible to determine the exact number of strains for each cluster and genogroup because new strains continue to be added.",

In rare cases, transmission can occur through organ transplantation [16, 17] . A low infectious dose of less than 5 genomic copies (viral particles) could be enough to infect a healthy adult (Moe, C.L. et al., unpublished data). In certain symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, virus can be shed for more than 3 weeks post-challenge or exposure [18, 19, 20] . In immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients, NoV has been detected in stool specimens for up to two years after initial infection [16, 17, 21, 22, 23] .

This number is probably a severe underestimate of the true burden of disease. In 2004, in the U.S., NoV was responsible for 48% of outbreaks among all reported gastroenteritis outbreaks and 79% of outbreaks among reported non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks [28] . GI and GII strains cause the majority of human outbreaks.

NoV may be internalized, usually through the mucosal route, after active administration of NoV inocula to volunteers (challenge) or animals (inoculation) or passive contact of humans or animals with NoV, usually in outbreaks (exposure). Challenge, inoculation or exposure with NoV may or may not lead to infection. Infection with NoV is defined as replication of NoV in the host. NoV infection can be determined by detection of viral particles or viral RNA in the host or by the presence of viral nonstructural proteins in host cells. Viral shedding is defined as the release of quantifiable virus in host specimens such as feces and vomitus. NoV may be detected in these specimens by molecular detection techniques, such as various forms of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR: conventional PCR, real time PCR, quantitative real time PCR, etc.), antigen capture immunoassays (e.g. ELISA), or electron microscopy. Infection may or may not lead to illness. The terms illness, disease, and symptomatic infection will be used interchangeably. NoV immunology refers to the host immune response induced after challenge, inoculation, or exposure to NoV.",

Prospective, retrospective, and case-control studies were common study designs and often took advantage of existing community and clinical specimens collected from studies [33, 34, 35] . In addition, clinical specimens (e.g. saliva, sera, stool) taken from outbreak investigations continue to provide a wealth of information to our understanding of NoV immunology. The advantages of these approaches are that the results are more representative of real conditions than laboratory studies and are directly applicable to the human condition.

In these studies, volunteers were enrolled in a clinical trial (after all the necessary regulatory approvals were met) and studied under controlled clinical conditions, usually in a hospital setting. Volunteers were challenged with various preparations of NoV, clinical specimens collected, and their responses recorded. The advantages of human challenge studies include: direct applicability of results to the human condition, control of study design and study power, and ease of obtaining clinical specimens. The disadvantages include: difficulty in obtaining all the relevant regulatory and ethical reviews and approvals, logistical issues involved with human volunteers, and difficulty in obtaining adequate sample sizes (study power). Another disadvantage is that human volunteers often have a range of pre-challenge exposures that will affect their response to the challenge. The difficulty is two-fold: (1) volunteers have diverse pre-challenge exposure history and (2) we do not have adequate methods of measuring and characterizing their pre-challenge exposure history.

This model utilizes gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs as an experimental animal model [40, 41, 42] . In this model, the investigators were able to infect the Gn pigs with a GII.4 human NoV after oral inoculation. Gn pigs have long been used to study human rotavirus pathogenesis and host immune responses and have the advantages of similar gastrointestinal physiology, mucosal immune responses and milk diet to that of infants [43, 44, 45, 46] . Other advantages of this model include susceptibility to human NoV infection, and similarity of symptoms with human disease, such as diarrhea and pathological changes in the gastrointestinal system [40] . Additionally, Gn pigs have histo-blood group antigens, like humans, that influence susceptibility to NoV. The incubation period for GII. 4 NoV in Gn pigs (12 to 48 hours) was similar to that observed in humans experimentally infected with Snow Mountain virus (SMV) (19 to 41 hours) [47] , and the diarrhea was mild and of short duration (1 to 4 days in most pigs). However, there are some differences compared to human disease. Multiple passages of NoV through various pigs (up to 3 serial passages) seemed to reduce the duration of diarrhea, reduce the prevalence of Gn pigs that shed virus, and reduced the duration of viral shedding although the virus was still infectious; therefore, multiple passages in the Gn pigs may be required for more complete adaptation of the GII.4 NoV to this animal model. The human NoVs infect the proximal small intestine in both humans and in Gn pigs. However, infected humans reportedly exhibit inflammation in the duodenum and jejunum [48, 49, 50] whereas Gn pigs exhibit mild pathological changes in the duodenum, but not jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, only 1 of 7 inoculated pigs exhibited pathological changes [40] .",

Similar to responses observed in adult human volunteers, newborn pigtail macaques reportedly began viral shedding after 24 hours, and it was reported that some shed virus in excess of 21 days [56] . Interestingly, the mother of one infected macaque that resided in the same cage also became ill with the same strain of human NoV. This finding suggested that horizontal transmission, probably by the fecal-oral route, had occurred, similar to NoV transmission in humans. Other investigators showed that inoculation of Rhesus macaques induced several weeks of viral shedding in one asymptomatic macaque [58] . Different non-human primate species exhibited varying clinical disease and shedding. Neither marmosets, cotton top tamarins, nor cynomolgus macaques developed diarrhea or clinical symptoms [58] . Both marmosets and tamarins shed virus for between 3 and 4 days post-inoculation, while cynomolgus macaques did not shed virus. Some non-human primates exhibited NoV-specific IgM and IgG (rapid rise by 14 days post inoculation); no NoV-specific IgA was detected in the saliva of any animal. The reported detection of IgG crossreactive with human NoV in mangabey, pigtail, Rhesus, and chimpanzee species suggests that non-human primates may be naturally infected by NoV [59] .",

In this model, either immunocompromised or wild type mice can be infected with a mouse-specific NoV. This mouse-specific NoV was named murine NoV (MNV-1) and was classified as a Genogroup V virus. To date, MNV is known to infect only mice and is a common pathogen in mouse colonies [61] . Immunocompromised STAT 1 knockout mice, when inoculated with MNV-1, developed massive viremia and inflammation in all organs and died within 10 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.) [60] . In contrast, wild type adult (8 week) 129 mice, when inoculated with MNV-1, exhibited viremia, and virus in a few organs including liver, spleen, and proximal intestine. These mice were able to clear MNV-1 by 3 d.p.i. and did not die. Of five mice inoculated, all seroconverted to NoV antigen between 14 and 21 d.p.i. [60] . Infection by other wild type mouse strains, MNV-2, MNV-3, MNV-4, in juvenile (4 week) CD1 mice resulted in viral shedding in feces and the presence of virus in mesenteric lymph node, spleen, and jejunum up to 8 weeks post-inoculation ( [62] and discussed in [63] ).",

Mice can acquire the virus through the fecal oral route, similar to humans. Wild-type mice housed with persistently-infected immunocompromised mice (RAG knockout mice) develop MNV-specific antibodies within 3 to 4 weeks of exposure (discussed in [63] ). Interestingly, mice can also acquire the virus through the respiratory route. Immunocompromised mice, but not wild type 129 mice, develop gastric bloating and diarrhea among other diverse clinical signs. Other clear advantages are the wealth of immunologic tools and mouse strains available to study the immunology of infection in mice and the ease of maintaining and setting up experiments. One disadvantage of this model is that wild type mice are asymptomatic and do not show lesions in the small intestine upon macroscopic inspection as is seen in human disease. Also, mice do not have the emetic physiologic response, so this variable and route of transmission cannot be assessed. Additionally, whether mice have the corresponding histo-blood group antigens like humans and pigs that influence susceptibility to NoV is unclear and precludes the use of mouse models for such investigations. In addition, infection of some immunocompromised mice with MNV-1 is lethal and leads to disseminated viremia, unlike human hosts.

This model will help investigators dissect the host cell-NoV interactions at the level of immune cells.

In addition, different strains of NoV were used as antigen in these studies.

            "text": "Examination of age-specific antibody seroprevalence in a variety of populations provides another key to understanding the body's immunologic response to NoV. Pediatric seroprevalence is particularly insightful as it illustrates the role of maternal antibodies and varied rates of antibody acquisition in different environments. The seroprevalence of NoV antibody in infants less than 4 months of age is similar to the number of seropositive women of childbearing age in the same community suggesting that these infants possess maternal antibodies [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72] . In general, these maternal antibodies persist for several months before a decrease in seroprevalence occurs. This decrease is usually observed between 3 and 6 months of age, although Parker et al. suggests that maternal antibody may be detectable in infants up to 8 months of age [73] . Figure 9 .1, collected from a representative set of studies, illustrates this trend. However, after 4 months of age, pediatric NoV seroprevalence shows variation across demographic lines. The contrasting rates of antibody acquisition in developed and developing countries is well documented and best understood within the context of pediatric seroprevalence. In several developing countries, including Bangladesh [74] , Kuwait [68] , rural Thailand [69] , South Africa [33] and Mexico [75] children appear to acquire \"primary infection\" during or prior to their second year of life. In Bangladesh, 100% of four-year-old children were seropositive for NoV antibody and, in general, childhood seroprevalence reaches [67, 68, 70, 71] . The presence of maternal antibodies at birth (0 years) and subsequent decrease in seroprevalence between 3 months and 2 years is illustrated. Each data marker indicates the median age in years for the age range specified in the original report and seroprevalence value given for each age group in a population. Please see Section 9.3.1 for additional information regarding this figure the maximum population-specific seroprevalence before age 5 in developing countries. In contrast, in developed countries, maternal antibodies decrease to low levels after 3 to 4 months, and the majority of children do not demonstrate subsequent serologic NoV response as a result of presumed exposure until age 12 [67, 76] . In Japan, NoV-specific seroprevalence is only 11% for children less than 6 years old while about 70% of adults are seropositive [76] , and, in the United States, adult levels of NoV-specific seroprevalence are not reached until adolescence [67] . Seroprevalence data from Beijing, China, Hokkaido, Japan and Southeast Asia associate steep increases of childhood acquisition of antibody against NoV with daycare and elementary school attendance [70, 76, 77] . Ultimately, the varied patterns of agespecific antibody acquisition may provide insight into the environment and behavior associated with exposure to NoV. Although the pattern of pediatric exposure to NoV is consistent, the pattern of adult seroprevalence of NoV appears to vary by populations. Greenberg et al. found that among 7 rural, urban, developed and developing countries there was no significant difference among adult seroprevalence [78] . However, examination of multiple seroprevalence studies indicates that there is variation among adult levels of seroprevalence. For example, an isolated Indian tribe in Ecuador, the Gabaro, was found to have no NoV antibodies in the late 1970s, while a Massachusetts cohort had a 50% NoV-specific seroprevalence in adulthood [79] , and Kuwaiti adults had a 100% NoV-specific seroprevalence [68] . Table 9 .1 illustrates adult seroprevalence from a representative number of international studies. While study design and method of [78] * Adults are defined as individuals over 20 years, unless otherwise defined within the publication. * * Year of study was not available so the date the study was published was used instead. \u2020 NoV-specific antibody for adults is defined as any isotype (IgG, IgA or IgM) seroprevalence for adults. \u2021 Because no general adult prevalence value was given, the median adult prevalence value was calculated and rounded from published data. antibody detection may account for some differences in the seroprevalence between populations, these findings also likely point to the roles of behavior and environment associated with exposure to NoV in a given population.",

First, lower socioeconomic status, poor standards of hygiene and limited access to potable water are found to be significantly associated with a higher NoV seroprevalence [35, 80, 81] . In agreement with these associations, a sero-epidemiological study of Chinese medical students found that students from rural towns had higher NoV-specific seroprevalence than students from urban settings [82] . Hygiene standards and socioeconomic status are often lower in rural settings. Other socio-behavioral factors associated with a higher NoV-specific seroprevalence include crowding within the home [35, 70, 80] and lower levels of maternal education [80] . In developed countries, the most common behavioral association with increased NoV-specific seroprevalence is childhood attendance at childcare centers or enrollment in elementary school [70, 76, 77, 80] . It is also notable that large outbreak situations are the most common pattern of infection in developed countries, indicating that high population density and common-source food or water contamination are important risk factors for infection [70, 83] . Additionally, there are a number of other factors associated with NoV-specific seroprevalence that are not specific to developed or developing countries including recreational water contact [80] , consumption of sea food [80, 83] , eating raw vegetables [80] , blood type [82] , and agricultural work [35, 84] . Ultimately, understanding the global patterns of seroprevalence and the associated risk behaviors will provide insight into the human immune response to NoV.",

This information is supported and refined with data from human challenge studies that provide more controlled conditions (discussed in subsequent sections). For example, in outbreaks, several NoV-specific antibody isotypes have been identified including serum IgA [85] , IgM [86] , and IgG [87] as well as antibodies in saliva [88] . These NoV-specific antibodies are cross-reactive and bind to multiple NoV strains within various clusters within and across genogroups [87, 89] . In general, higher cross-reactivity is observed within clusters [89] and genogroups than across genogroups [6, 89] . As will be later discussed, pre-challenge serum antibodies, determined from acute serum specimens, did not provide protection from infection [90] . Lastly, outbreaks also show us that infection with one NoV strain does not protect from re-infection with a different strain [90] .",

In general, a fourfold rise in NoV-specific antibody levels (from samples collected at least after 2 weeks post challenge) compared to baseline (from samples collected before or temporally close to NoV challenge) suggests infection. Unfortunately, serology is not as specific as genomic methods (e.g. real time PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, genomic based phylogeny and classification) to diagnose and classify NoV strains because of the presence of pre-challenge antibodies and cross-reactivity across strains. Serology may also not be as sensitive as genomic methods at diagnosing infections. For example, high levels of pre-challenge antibodies may mask a fourfold rise in antibody levels after exposure. Genomic methods should be used as the main diagnostic and classification tool for NoV strains, and serology should be used to complement existing results or as an aid in outbreak investigations when stool specimens or genomic methods are not available.",

In volunteer studies, the time to first symptom, or incubation period, ranged from 10 to 51 hours for Norwalk virus (NV) challenge (reviewed in [38] ) and 19 to 41 hours for Snow Mountain virus challenge [47] . Symptoms may last from a few hours to several days. In our experience, NV-infected volunteers usually exhibit symptoms from 1 to 2 days while Snow Mountain virus infected volunteers usually exhibit symptoms from 1 to 5 days (Leon, J.S. and Moe, C.L. unpublished data). Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, fever, chills and myalgia. Diarrhea stools are non-bloody, watery, and do not contain mucus or fecal leukocytes [37] . In agreement with these manifestations, fecal lactoferrin, a sensitive marker for intestinal polymorphonuclear leukocyte inflammation, is generally not detected [101] . In rare cases, NoV has been associated with encephalopathy (NoV was also detected in stool, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum) [102] , neck stiffness, disseminated intravascular coagulation, photophobia, reduced alertness [103] and sore throat [104] . Dehydration is often the most serious complicating factor and may induce death in young children and elderly individuals. There is a relationship between symptoms and NoV-specific antibodies and this will be discussed in Section 9.4.4.4. In an immunocompetent host, symptoms usually resolve after a few days. The severity of illness and manifestation of specific symptoms seems to depend on both the NoV strain and the individual.",

No abnormalities were observed two weeks [49, 105] and six to eight weeks after challenge [108] . Interestingly, these jejunum lesions were also observed 48 hours after challenge with Norwalk or Hawaii virus in some asymptomatic volunteers [50, 105, 108] . However, other asymptomatic volunteers exhibited no jejunum lesions 48 hours after NV challenge [48] . It is unlikely that these asymptomatic volunteers had no lesions because they were genetically resistant to NV infection, as some of these asymptomatic volunteers had previously been challenged and became ill after NV infection. Histological lesions were not observed in the gastric fundus, antrum, or rectal mucosa of volunteers challenged with NV [105, 109] . Based on this data, it is worth speculating that jejunum lesions are associated with NoV infection in the presence or absence of clinical illness.",

However, animal models have provided several clues as to the identity of the target cell. In Gn pigs inoculated with human NoV, the NoV capsid protein was detected, via confocal immunofluorescent microscopy, in enterocytes in discrete areas of the villi of the duodenum and jejunum and in some cells in the ileum [40] . Positive enterocytes of these inoculated pigs were mainly located at the sides or tips of each villus. The viral capsid was also observed in deep areas of the duodenum. It was not clear whether the capsid protein was located in Brunner glands or crypts. To identify areas of viral replication, the nonstructural N-terminal viral protein was identified in some, but not all, enterocytes that expressed the capsid protein. The N-terminal protein was found in the apical end of enterocytes. By transmission electron microscopy, calicivirus-like particles of 25-40 nm in diameter were observed in cytoplasmic vesicles in enterocytes.",

The first question is whether short-term or long-term immunity can be induced and protect from future NoV infection. An effective vaccine should be able to induce host immunity that protects from future NoV infection. The second question is whether protective homologous and heterologous immunity can be induced. An effective vaccine should induce protective immunity against antigens in the vaccine (homologous) and, ideally, against related antigens not present in the vaccine (heterologous). These questions have been incompletely addressed in three separate human NoV challenge-re-challenge studies [48, 111, 112] . These studies were unable to use the current definition of infection (detection of viral shedding) because molecular assays were not available at the time these studies were conducted. Instead, clinical symptoms were used as a marker of NoV infection. Because infected individuals do not always exhibit clinical symptoms, the results of these studies should be interpreted with caution. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish whether a positive immune response in a volunteer, especially to a cross-reactive antigen, may be the result of either a current or past norovirus infection.",

            "text": "Two general hypotheses can be derived from these studies (reviewed [30, 38, 113, 114] ). The first hypothesis is that challenge or exposure to NoV induces \"short-term immunity\" (6 months or less) but not \"long-term immunity\" (beyond 2 years) that protects from subsequent re-challenge or re-exposure to the same strain. This is based on the observation that challenged volunteers who became ill initially were re-challenged, within 6-15 weeks with the same virus and did not become ill [112] . Illness after re-challenge was 0/5 volunteers for NV (GI.1), 0/6 volunteers for Montgomery County virus (GI.5), and 0/3 for Hawaii virus (GII.1). The inability of each strain to induce illness in the re-challenged host was not due to a genetic factor because each strain was able to induce illness in the initial challenge. Therefore, these results suggest that previous challenge or exposure to NoV may induce protective immunity (6-15 weeks) that protects from subsequent challenge or exposure to the same strain. In agreement with this hypothesis, challenge and re-challenge with the same strain of bovine NoV within 30 days induced protection from viral shedding and clinical signs in Gn calves (discussed in 5.6 and in [53] ). A separate NV challenge study demonstrated that re-challenge 6 months after the initial challenge did not result in illness in some volunteers who had become ill in the initial challenge [111] . A third NV challenge study demonstrated that re-challenge after 27 and 42 months induced illness in all volunteers that initially developed illness upon first challenge [48] . Collectively, these observations suggest that challenge with NoV provides protection against subsequent illness if volunteers are re-challenged with NoV within 6 months, but not after 2 years. Whether re-challenge, between 6 months and 2 years, protects individuals from human illness has not yet been addressed.",

            "text": "The second hypothesis is that challenge with NoV can induce both protective homologous immunity against re-challenge with the same strain, shown above, and protective heterologous immunity against re-challenge with certain other strains. Heterologous immunity is thought to depend on immune reactivity to shared epitopes in the virus capsid between different NoV strains (shared epitopes will be discussed in Sections 9.4.4.2 and 9.4.4.3). This hypothesis is based on the observation that challenged volunteers who became ill and were re-challenged, within 6-13 weeks with a different virus, did not become ill [112] . Illness after Montgomery County virus (GI.5) re-challenge occurred in 0/8 volunteers initially challenged with NV (GI.1) and in 0/4 volunteers initially challenged with Hawaii virus (GII.1). Interestingly, illness after NV re-challenge occurred in 1/3 volunteers initially challenged with Montgomery County, suggesting that complete protection may have been in one direction, but that incomplete protection may occur in the other direction. Within GI NoVs, one Montgomery County challenged individual developed a significant rise of NV-virus-specific antibodies, suggesting antigenic relatedness between these viruses [112] . However, challenge and re-challenge between genogroups did not provide complete protection in either direction. For example, challenge with NV (GI) and re-challenge with Hawaii virus (GII) resulted in 3/6 ill volunteers while challenge with Hawaii virus and re-challenge with NV resulted in 2/3 ill volunteers. This result suggests that Norwalk and Hawaii virus are antigenically different which is confirmed by their classification into distinct genogroups [8] and the absence of antibody cross-reactivity in serologic studies [112, 115, 116] . This result is also in agreement with a study of two outbreaks involving some overlapping cases. One case who became ill upon infection with a Norwalk-like virus (GI) later became ill upon infection with a Hawaii-like virus (GII) 6 months later in another outbreak (classification of Norwalk and Hawaii virus was based on the reactivity of the individual's sera to NV and Hawaii antigen) [90] . Based on the challenge-re-challenge study [112] , because some volunteers did not become ill upon re-challenge (NV-Hawaii, Hawaii-NV, and Montgomery County-NV challenge-re-challenge), it is still possible that heterologous immunity protected these individuals from illness, albeit to a lesser degree. It is also possible that while these volunteers were genetically susceptible to the initial challenge strain and all became ill, some volunteers could have been genetically resistant to the different re-challenge strain and therefore did not become ill.",

The first observation was that NV challenge induced illness in two individuals but did not induce illness upon NV re-challenge three years later [111] . This observation suggests that long-term immunity (beyond two years) can be induced after one NoV challenge. These two individuals developed seroconversion to NV after re-challenge. It could be argued that these individuals were not protected because they seroconverted which may indicate viral shedding. However, seroconversion does not always indicate viral shedding and seroconversion can still occur in a protected host. Therefore, \"long-term\" immunity may have protected these two challenged-re-challenged human volunteers from clinical disease. In comparison, initial inoculation of calves with bovine NoV induced diarrhea, viral shedding, and seroconversion, and subsequent challenge 30 days later with bovine NoV failed to significantly increase IgA or IgG titer consistent with lack of diarrhea or detectable viral shedding in these \"protected\" calves (discussed in Section 9.5.6) [51] .",

Genetic resistance to NV in this individual would explain the results after the first three challenges. However, the current hypothesis is that genetically resistant individuals do not respond immunologically to NoV [117] . If this hypothesis is valid, and the individual was genetically resistant, then they could not have responded immunologically by seroconversion after the fourth challenge. Therefore, either the individual was genetically resistant and this hypothesis is invalid or the individual was genetically susceptible and this hypothesis is still valid. A second explanation for this observation could be that resistance to infection in this individual was mediated by a non-genetic, non-serum immune mechanism, such as a local mucosal immune mechanism, and that after four repeated immunological insults, the serum immune mechanism became activated and the individual seroconverted. Because no additional data is available on this individual, it is difficult to determine a definitive mechanism for this observation.",

For example, Parrino et al. [48] stated, \"Our data suggests that serum antibody by immune electron microscopy reflects infection in susceptible persons but does not appear to play a uniformly protective part in Norwalk-agent illness. . .. One hypothesis that could explain our findings is that local antibody rather than circulating antibody may determine clinical response after challenge with Norwalk agent.\" This hypothesis is based on the observation that levels of pre-challenge NV-specific titers did not correlate with illness in challenged-rechallenged volunteers with NV. We and many other groups have also observed this finding (discussed in Section 9.4.4.4). In addition, our group has found that \"local antibody\", in the form of mucosal IgA, was associated with protection to infection [117] . A similar association between induction of fecal IgA antibodies by wild type NoV (one inoculation) or NoV VLPs (2 or 3 immunizations), using LT(192G) as adjuvant, and complete or partial protection, respectively against homologous GIII NoV inoculation at post-inoculation day 30 was reported for Gn calves by Han et al. [53] . Parrino et al. [48] also stated that, \"A second hypothesis that could explain our findings is based upon a genetic control of susceptibility to Norwalk-agent infection.\" This hypothesis is based on the observation that some individuals remained illness-free upon challenge and re-challenge, after 31-24 months, with NV. We and others have also identified genetic factors mediating resistance (discussed in 4.3) to Norwalk virus infection.",

The mechanism of this resistance is thought to be due to the absence of a NoV receptor or binding molecule in genetically resistant individuals. These genetically resistant individuals, when exposed to NoV, do not provide any binding or internalization site for NoV, their cells do not become infected, and they do not develop illness. This mechanism is similar to that postulated for the CCR5 receptor in HIV infection [120, 121] . Presumably, because these individuals do not become infected, their immune system does not \"see\" the virus, and they do not mount an immune response to this specific NoV strain. The absence of immune response in genetically resistant individuals has not been rigorously tested but is supported by current evidence from human challenge and outbreak studies [117, 122, 123] .",

HBGAs are complex carbohydrates present on the surfaces of mucosal epithelium and red blood cells of the genitourinary, respiratory, and digestive tracts and are also present as free oligosaccharides in saliva, intestinal contents, breast milk and blood. Three families of HBGAs associated with NoV infection are thought to be the Lewis, secretor and ABO families (reviewed in [119] ). Secretor status, one of the HBGA families, is associated with resistance to certain GI and GII NoV infections in challenge, endemic, and outbreak studies [117, 122, 123, 124] , but seems to be NoV strain specific [125] . Because secretor status seems to affect susceptibility to NoV infection, it also appears to affect the levels and prevalence of NoV-specific antibodies. In 105 plasma specimens from Swedish blood donors, secretor negative individuals and Le a+b\u2212 individuals had significantly lower GII.4 VLP-specific antibody titers and were more often antibody negative than secretor positive and Le a\u2212b+ individuals [122] .

In a study of a GI virus outbreak, individuals with blood group B were significantly less likely to acquire NV VLP-specific IgG and individuals with blood group A were significantly more likely to acquire NV VLP-specific IgG [127] .

            "text": "There seems to be a general temporal order of the appearance of NoV-specific antibody isotypes, IgG, IgM, and IgA. This order and the relative levels vary depending on the individual and may be confounded by pre-challenge NoV-specific antibodies due to previous NoV infection. The synthesis presented below is based on data from a few human challenge studies and has not been rigorously addressed. General trends and ranges of these NoV-specific isotypes are illustrated in Fig. 9 .2. In general, in studies of human volunteers challenged with NoV, NoV-specific serum IgG, IgM and IgA increases are first observed after 5 days [86, 130, 134, 135] . In general, NoV-specific IgG levels reach their maximum at 3 weeks post-challenge, although some data suggests it may take up to 7 weeks for NoV-specific IgG levels to peak. Peak NoV-specific IgA and IgM levels occur earlier than IgG, generally during the second week of observation [86, 134, 135] . NoV-specific IgG levels tend to be higher than NoV-specific IgM levels that tend to be higher than NoV-specific IgA levels [86] . Furthermore, NoV-specific serum IgG levels tend to last longer at substantially elevated levels compared to NoV-specific IgM and IgA levels and maintain a plateau near their peak value for up to 100 days or more and decline thereafter. NoV-specific serum IgM levels revert to pre-challenge levels between 2 and 4 months [86, 130, 134] , while NoV-specific serum IgA levels seem to persist for 1-2 months and then revert back to pre-challenge levels by 3 months [86, 130] . In some individuals, NoV-specific IgA may persist for 15 months after challenge [86] . Notably, several individuals failed to mount an IgG, IgA or an IgM response [130, 135] , perhaps because they were genetically resistant and not infected. Because of these trends, NoV-specific IgM and IgA seroconversion could be cautiously used as a marker of recent infection. In general, NoV-specific salivary IgA and IgG are induced one week after challenge and peak 2 weeks after initial challenge [117] . Some individuals may exhibit a rapid rise in NoV-specific salivary IgA prior to 5 days post-challenge. NoV-specific salivary IgG and IgA may persist for up to 40 days post-challenge (Leon, J.S. and Moe, C. L. unpublished data) but longer time-points post-challenge have not been reported. NoV-specific fecal IgA antibodies can be detected by two weeks post-challenge and may persist for up to two months [136] . Repeated infections may prolong the duration and magnitude of the antibody response [134] . The degree of correlation among the antibody isotypes has not been adequately addressed. In general the correlation between levels of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM seem to be high, but the degree of correlation has not yet been statistically analyzed [86, 116, 130] . We found that volunteers challenged with NV (n = 77) had NVspecific serum and saliva IgA and IgG levels that were significantly correlated with each other and had Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.5 and 0.8 (Leon J.S. and Moe. C. L. unpublished data). Because animal studies can use na\u00efve hosts for inoculation, the duration of antibodies and degree of correlation between antibody isotypes obtained from animal studies will be clearer than the data collected from human studies.",

A single capsid protein has two main domains, the shell domain (S, aa residues 1-225) and the protruding domain (P) that is subdivided into two subdomains, P1 (aa residues 226-278 and 406-530) and P2 (aa residues 279-405) [143] . The distally located P2 subdomain is a large insertion in the P1 subdomain and protrudes more than the P1 subdomain. A comparison of capsid proteins from various calicivirus suggests that the S domain is well conserved, the P1 subdomain is moderately conserved, and the P2 subdomain is highly variable [142] . Chronic human infection with NoV induces the least number of mutations in the S domain, more in the P1 domain, and the majority in the P2 domain, suggesting that the P2 domain has important functions in host-pathogen interaction and pathogen or viral evasion [17] . Conserved regions in both the S domain and P1 domain may contribute to antibody cross-reactivity across clusters and genogroups [137] . For example, epitopes in the S domain from GI and GIII capsid proteins [144] or from GIII and GII VLPs [145] could bind the same monoclonal antibody derived from immunization of mice with NoV VLPs. The majority of monoclonal antibodies induced after immunization with NoV capsid protein targeted the S domain and cross-reacted with epitopes on GI and GII NoV capsid proteins [146] . One epitope in the P1 domain (aa 457-530) is common to GI viruses [139, 147] . The hypervariable P2 domain seems to contain multiple determinants for antigenicity, cell binding, and host specificity [138, 140, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153] (reviewed in [114, 119] ). With the development of in vitro NoV-specific antibody blocking assays, additional epitopes important for NoV neutralization and blocking will be identified.",

These NoV-specific antibodies are cross-reactive and bind to multiple NoV strains within various clusters and across genogroups [87, 89] . In general, higher cross-reactivity is observed within clusters [89] and genogroups than across genogroups [6, 89] . In addition, the prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies after challenge, inoculation, exposure or immunization is usually lower than 100% in human and animal models. Because NoV infection induces cross-reactive antibodies, serologic assays are not useful for classification of NoV strains. In addition, the ability of serologic assays to detect cross-reactivity also depends on the quality and nature of the antigens used in the detection assay (e.g. fully formed VLPs versus recombinant capsid proteins that do not form VLPs). The cross-reactive nature of the immune response against NoV can be utilized to design effective vaccines that protect against antigens not present in the vaccine (discussed in Section 9.5.4) and may eventually be helpful in the design of broad serologic assays for the detection of NoV-specific antibodies in populations.",

However after adjusting for secretor status in volunteers challenged with one virus strain, NV, (NV, n = 77), the presence of prechallenge serum NV-specific IgG antibodies were associated with an increased risk of infection [117] . This association was also observed for all volunteers without adjustment for any confounders. Pre-challenge NV-specific saliva IgA was not associated with infection. In agreement with this finding, infected volunteers from another NV challenge study (n = 50) exhibited significantly higher pre-challenge NV-specific IgG than uninfected volunteers [19] . In another NV challenge study using similar volunteers (n = 38), a higher pre-challenge NV-specific fecal IgA antibody geometric mean titer was found in ill compared to well volunteers and in infected versus uninfected volunteers [157] . In these two studies, secretor status was unknown and therefore the effect of secretor status on the probability of becoming infected and having an antibody response was not taken into account. In another study, we challenged volunteers with a NoV genotype II (GII) virus, Snow Mountain (SMV) (n = 15) [125] . We did not observe any association between the presence of pre-challenge Snow Mountain-specific IgG or IgA and infection.",

In our NV human challenge study, a portion of genetically susceptible individuals (secretor positive) was resistant to NV infection, suggesting that a memory immune response or other mechanism also protected them from NV infection [117] . The majority of the uninfected group (60%) exhibited a rapid rise in NV-specific salivary IgA titer before 5 days post-challenge. In contrast, the majority of the infected group (83%) exhibited a rise in NV-specific salivary IgA titer only after 5 days postchallenge. The rapid immunological response to NV challenge in secretor-positive, uninfected individuals suggests that acquired immunity may explain the difference in those secretor-positive volunteers who developed infection after challenge and those who did not. Therefore, the timing of the NV-specific mucosal IgA may be a good predictor of the risk of infection among genetically susceptible volunteers. At the same time, 6 out of the 15 uninfected volunteers did not develop a NV-specific salivary IgA response suggesting that other unidentified factors may also be associated with protection. In another one of our studies, where volunteers were challenged with Snow Mountain virus (n = 15), volunteers were infected regardless of their secretor status or blood group type [125] . Because we could not adjust for a genetic component (if there was one), we could not assess the effect of immunity independently and examine if the timing of salivary antibodies affected infection. Instead, we found Snow Mountain virus (SMV) infection increased SMV-specific IgG levels in serum and SMV-specific IgA levels in saliva after 14 or 21 days.",

These individuals, in general, will have lower NoV A-specific antibody levels, but once infected with strain B, may have higher NoV A and B specific antibody levels due to heterologous and homologous cross-reactivity.

As discussed above, the presence of NoV-specific pre-challenge antibodies has been associated with increased risk of infection. Because infection may lead to symptoms, it is not surprising that the presence of pre-challenge antibodies (serum IgG, IgA, IgM, fecal IgA) has been associated with increased risk of developing symptoms [79, 116] and viral excretion [19] . Similarly, because infection may lead to both symptoms and rise of NoV-specific antibodies, the development of NoVspecific antibodies (serum IgG, IgA, IgM), as expected, was also associated with symptoms [79, 115, 130] and viral excretion [19] . In the NV challenge study reported by Cukor et al. [134] , the association between NV-specific serum IgM and symptoms was significant (RR = 3.8, 95% CI [1.1-12.5], p < 0.01) (Leon, J.S. and Moe, C.L. unpublished data). Few reports have examined the association between NoV-specific antibodies and certain symptoms. One NV challenge study found a significant association between rise of the NV-specific titers and vomiting and nausea, headache or body ache, vomiting, and vomiting and diarrhea [19] while an epidemiologic study of Brazilian children found an association between NV-specific IgG seroconversion and diarrhea or vomiting [34] .",

One direct way to assess their contribution in vivo is through passive transfer studies where serum or purified NoV-specific antibodies are transferred to recipients that will be challenged or exposed to NoV and then monitor them for infection and illness. In humans, epidemiological studies may address this by examining the association between transfer of maternal NoV-specific antibodies to children and children's risk of infection. In animal models, NoV-specific antibodies may be passively transferred to recipients to assess whether these antibodies prevent infection or diminish the duration or severity of infection in the recipient. Currently, both the pig and murine models are best suited for this approach. In unpublished observations, passive transfer of MNV1-reactive polyclonal serum was able to delay MNV1induced lethality in immunocompromised mice (RAG2/STAT1) after intraperitoneal transfer suggesting that NoV-specific antibodies may protect the host from NoV infection and disease (discussed in [63] ).",

Because, until recently, there was no in vitro model of NoV infection it was not possible to detect these \"blocking\" or \"neutralization\" antibodies. Instead, over the past 3 decades, groups have attempted to detect antibodies that can competitively prevent NoV binding to other antibodies [79, 96, 158, 159] , other cells [153] , or putative NoV receptors like the HBGA family [160, 161] . These assays have been adapted for the detection of various NoV antibody isotypes [134] and NoV specificities [86, 162, 163] . Antibodies that block binding of NoV to other antibodies have been associated with increased risk of infection and illness, as discussed in Section 9.4.4.4. Antibodies that block binding of NoV VLPs to tissue culture cells were obtained from a monoclonal antibody raised against NV VLP, but not sera from NV-infected individuals [153] . These antibodies identified site(s) of the P2 domain on VP1 important for binding of tissue culture cells to VLPs [140] . Antibodies that block binding of NoV VLPs to HBGA structures are present in infected individuals [100, 161] , mice [160, 161] , and pigs [41] and block HBGA binding in a strain-specific manner. These assays have not yet been used in human challenges studies to investigate the associations between these antibodies and infection, symptoms, viral shedding and other clinical parameters.",

Through this assay, Thackray et al. demonstrated that MNV-specific antibodies induced after infection with 5 genetically distinct MNV strains were all equally effective at blocking MNV1 infection of RAW cells in a dose dependent manner. These results suggest that murine MNVs collected from research mouse colonies probably comprise only 1 serogroup [164] .

Innate immune protection seems to be mediated by downstream mediators of the STAT1 response, including the family of interferons, \u2423, \u2424, and \u2425. When the STAT-JNK pathway was deleted in mice, intracranial murine NoV (MNV) inoculation killed all STAT1 knockout mice [60] . Intracranial MNV inoculation of IFN-\u2423\u2424\u2425 receptor knockout mice also killed all mice suggesting that deletion of all the interferon receptors renders a mouse susceptible to death from NoV inoculation. Neither, IFN-\u2423\u2424 receptor or IFN-\u2425 receptor knockout mice died after MNV inoculation suggesting that any receptor is sufficient for survival. However, these mice had similar and persistent levels and distribution of NoV as their inoculated STAT1 counterparts suggesting that other factors are important for viral clearance. Knocking out other important IFN anti-viral mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR), in mice also did not result in lethality. Interestingly, while intracranial inoculation killed all susceptible mice, intranasal and perioral inoculations were less lethal than intracranial inoculation. Other innate mucosal factors may mediate protection in these mice after inoculation. Taken together, these results suggest that innate immunity, specifically IFN or STAT1-dependent immune responses may be responsible for the rapid control of NoV infection in humans but not viral clearance [63] .",

Inoculated wild type mice that have STAT1-dependent immune responses have lower levels of virus in their intestine and peripheral organs than inoculated STAT1 knockouts or infected IFN-\u2423\u2424\u2425 receptor knockout mice [110] . This low viremia in wild type mice was accompanied by detectable levels of IFN-\u2423 in sera and intestinal homogenates. In addition, bone marrow derived macrophages or dendritic cells from wild type mice exhibited lower MNV replication rates than STAT1, IFN-\u2423\u2424\u2425 receptor knockout, and IFN-\u2423\u2424 receptor knockout mice [64] . This lower replication rate was accompanied by secretion of IFN-\u2423 in MNV-infected wild type bone marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells [64] . Interestingly, infected macrophage or dendritic cells from IFN-\u2425 receptor knockout, iNOS knockout, and PKR knockout mice had similar MNV replication rates as wild type suggesting that IFN-\u2425 iNOS, and PKR do not affect MNV replication rates [64] . These results suggest that STAT1, the combined IFN-\u2423\u2424\u2425 receptors, and the combined IFN-\u2423\u2424 receptors are important in the control of viral replication. Therefore, it is likely that both IFN-\u2423 and \u2424 are also important in the control of viral replication, but direct experiments to demonstrate this have yet to be done. In contrast, the IFN-\u2425 receptor, PKR, and iNOS have no significant effect, compared to wild type, in the control of viral replication in macrophages and dendritic cells. Based on these results, Mumphrey et al. proposed two mechanisms for the role of STAT1 and IFNs: (1) IFN-induced host factors directly inhibit viral replication at the primary site of entry and (2) IFN responses limit NoV dissemination and replication in secondary tissues [110] . Interestingly, human challenge with NV or Hawaii virus did not induce detectable levels of interferon in sera, jejunal aspirates, or jejunal biopsy specimens taken 48-96 hours post-challenge [165] .",

Experiments by Karts et al. showed that MNV inoculated RAG1 and RAG2 knockout mice, mice that lacked B and T cells, did not die [60] . However, these mice exhibited a persistent viremia throughout all their organs up to 90 d.p.i. Based on these results, the authors hypothesize that the adaptive immune response, in contrast to the STAT1-dependent innate immune response, was not required for protection against lethal MNV infection. Instead, the components of the adaptive immune response, specifically B and/or T cells, were required to contain and clear murine NoV infection [63] . These studies also showed that NoV can continuously replicate in tissues for long periods of time without causing severe morbidity or lethality. These results may explain the persistent viral shedding observed in immunocompromised patients, which may last up to two years in some cases [16, 17, 21, 22, 23] . These immunocompromised patients have impaired B and T cell responses that may not be able to clear replicating virus. One group found that reducing immunosuppression in transplant recipients was essential for clearing human calicivirus infection [22] .",

In our human challenge study, we demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from challenged volunteers respond to Snow Mountain virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro by secreting cytokines 8-21 days post-challenge [125] . Among all secreted cytokines assayed, IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 exhibited the highest levels and prevalence among all specimens. Post-challenge PBMCs also secreted TNF-\u2423, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 cytokines (at least fourfold level above baseline) in a few volunteers. There was no significant difference in pre-challenge and post-challenge PBMCs stimulated with SMV VLP for any cytokine in either uninfected or infected volunteers, perhaps due to small sample size. Interestingly, IFN-\u2425 was detected in 91% of pre-challenge PBMCs after SMV VLP stimulation suggesting previous NoV exposure and immunological memory in these volunteers. Sera was also assayed for cytokine levels, and infected volunteers exhibited a significant rise in IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 levels at 2 days post-challenge; no difference was observed for IL-6 and IL-10. There was no difference in IFN-\u2425, IL-2, IL-6 or IL-10 from post-challenge serum specimens compared to pre-challenge serum specimens for uninfected volunteers. These results suggest that: (1) challenged individuals respond to NoV antigen with secretion of anti-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, (2) serum cytokines can be quickly induced by 2 days post-challenge and (3) challenged individuals probably had pre-challenge NoV exposure.",

Interestingly, a group of students that had a NoV and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) co-infection (n = 10, 8 GI and 2 GII strains), exhibited the aforementioned cytokines and a significant and large increase in secreted IL-10 in their diarrhea specimens compared to students who had no detectable pathogens. It is important to note that cytokine secretion in this study was not antigen-specific. One advantage of this study is that fecal cytokines probably better reflect the gut mucosal immune response during NoV infection than serum cytokines. These results suggest that symptomatic NoV infection is associated with an inflammatory gut response, while symptomatic co-infection with ETEC is associated with both an inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gut response.",

            "text": "Human milk can protect children from infectious diseases through a number of mechanisms. To date, human milk is thought to protect the infant from NoV infection through two mechanisms (reviewed in [118, 119] ). One mechanism is through transfer of NoV-specific antibodies from mother to child. Epidemiologic studies have suggested the presence of high titers of maternal NoV-specific antibodies in infants up to 8 months of age [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 79] . The ability of maternal milk to block NoV binding in a radioimmunoassay in the late 1970s indicated the presence of NoV-specific antibody. However, it was not until recently that NoVspecific IgA has been identified in human maternal milk [167, 168] . About 13% of human milk specimens, from mothers in Chiba City, Japan, had NoV-specific IgA that bound to different and multiple NoV clusters, including those within GI and GII. The prevalence of NoV-specific IgA to certain clusters varied depending on the clusters (e.g. antibodies to GII.6 had a prevalence of 13.6% while antibodies to GI.8 had a prevalence of 0.8%) [167] . In addition, the prevalence of NoV-specific IgA to certain clusters also depended on the mothers' HBGA makeup, specifically her secretor status [168] .",

These decoy receptors in human milk are thought to bind NoV, prevent NoV from binding to host gastrointestinal cells, and therefore prevent NoV infection in infants. These decoy receptors are glycoproteins that correspond to the bile salt stimulated lipases and a milk fraction including the mucins MUC1 and MUC4 [169] . The ability of these glycoproteins to protect from NoV infection may depend on the mother's HBGA makeup, the infant's HBGA makeup and the HBGA binding pattern of the NoV strain [118] . In agreement with this model, two groups found a concordance between the mother's secretor status and Lewis phenotype and the ability of their milk to inhibit the binding of different NoV strains [168, 169] . Interestingly, not all of the mother's HBGAs were expressed in their milk specimens [168] . It is likely that, in the future, additional protective factors against NoV will be identified in mother's milk.",

Clean water, hygiene and sanitation are effective public health interventions at reducing diarrhea morbidity and mortality associated with most enteric pathogens [170, 171] . However, developed countries, like the U.S. and Japan, that generally have clean water, good sanitation and hygiene practices, still have a high rate of outbreaks associated with NoV. This suggests that, for enteric pathogens that are highly infectious, these measures are not sufficient to prevent transmission. Therefore, an effective NoV vaccine is a necessary intervention to reduce the public health burden of this disease, especially in developed countries. To date, there is no commercially available NoV vaccine, but much progress has been made in the past decade to develop a vaccine. This section summarizes these advances, and the reader is encouraged to read other reviews on this topic [30, 32, 172, 173, 174, 175 ].",

NV-specific IgA was detected in saliva, stool, semen, and vaginal washes. Three doses of VLPs, 250 g, 500 g and 2000 g, were administered to different groups of volunteers, and no significant differences were observed in either levels of antibodies, seroconversion rates, or antibody secreting cells among the various volunteer groups. PBMCs harvested from the groups receiving 250 g and 500 g of VLPs at day 21 post-immunization, proliferated and secreted IFN-\u2425 in response to NV VLP antigens. IFN-\u2425 secretion was not detected in PBMCS collected 56 days post-immunization. Interestingly, PBMCs harvested from the group receiving 2000 g did not develop any cell-mediated response at either day 21 or 56 post-immunization. The authors could not explain this finding, but it is possible that a high VLP antigen dose could have induced oral tolerance to this antigen, similar to that observed in other systems (reviewed in [182] ).

Administration of cholera toxin together with oral feeding of NV VLPs to Balb/c mice and CD1 mice induced higher levels of NV-specific antibodies, a higher response at lower VLP immunization doses, and a higher rate of seroconversion [176] . In a similar study, a modified cholera toxin administered to mice that received oral NV VLPs also boosted the levels of NV-specific IgA present in various organs including the lungs, trachea, small intestine, and Peyer's patches [177] . The authors observed higher NV-specific IgG, IgA, and IgA antibody secreting cells, higher T cell proliferation and IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 secretion and higher CD4 + and CD8 + stimulation in spleens and Peyer's patches. Interestingly, in this study, administration of bicarbonate also had a mild \"adjuvant\" effect. Another mucosal adjuvant, mucosal Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin, LT and its nontoxic mutant, LT(R192G), also enhanced the magnitude and duration of NV-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses after oral and intranasal administration of NV VLPs to Balb/c mice [178, 183] . Mice inoculated with these two adjuvants developed NV-specific IFN-\u2425, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 secretion in splenocytes, lymph node cells, and Peyer's patches [183] . Lastly, oral administration of a raw material from a yeast cell lysate containing a GII.4 VLP induced NoV-specific serum IgG, fecal IgA and blocking antibodies to histo-blood group putative receptors. The raw yeast material could have served as an adjuvant although this was not tested [184] .

Levels induced by intranasal immunization persisted longer than levels induced by oral immunization. It is possible that the use of appropriate adjuvants for oral immunization would enhance the responses seen after this route of immunization. In mice, other investigators used intramuscular and intranasal immunization routes but did not directly compare them with each other or with oral routes [177, 184] . In a separate study in mice, oral immunization was superior to intraperitoneal or subcutaneous immunization (without adjuvant) at generating NoV-specific hybridomas, suggesting that oral immunization induced a higher number of antibody-producing cells than the other tested routes 2 [185] . Lastly, one group successfully infected mice with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicating particles (VEE-VRP) expressing various NoV antigens in the footpad [160, 179] . Mice mounted high levels of serum and gut NoV-specific IgA and IgG after infection. Differing immunization routes also induced different types of humoral and cellular immune responses [183, 185] .",

Cross-protection can be indirectly assayed by determining whether cross-reactive humoral and cellular responses are present against various antigens or directly assayed by immunizing a host against one antigen or infecting a host with a NoV strain and later determining whether challenge with a different strain results in decreased or no disease/infection. It is important to note that only direct assays of cross-protection, and not indirect assays of cross-protection, will indicate whether immunization or infection with an antigen/NoV strain will protect from future challenge with a different NoV strain. Cross-protection was indirectly observed in humans and animals after the induction of cross-reactive antibodies and cellular responses after immunization with NoV VLPs and after infection with NoV, as previously discussed in Sections 9.4.2, 9.4.4, and 9.4.5. Cross-protection was directly observed in early human challenge studies where volunteers were initially challenged with NV (GI.1) or Hawaii virus (GII.1) and did not become ill when later challenged with Montgomery County virus (GI.5) [112] (classification of Montgomery County virus determined from [36] ), as discussed in 4.2. In general, it seems as though cross-reactivity and protection is preferentially genogroup specific. For example, challenge with GII antigens induced stronger immune responses against other GII antigens than GI antigens [115, 116, 125] .",

These mice developed homotypic antibodies to the specific antigens they received as well as heterotypic antibodies to other antigens (Norwalk, Hawaii, Snow Mountain, and Lordsdale). As previously discussed, the levels of the cross-reactive antibodies were highest among genogroups than across genogroups [160] . Interestingly, na\u00efve Balb/c mice immunized with a trivalent VEE-VRP cocktail containing Norwalk, Hawaii, and Snow Mountain antigen and lacking Lordsdale antigen, generated levels of Lordsdalespecific IgG of similar magnitude as Balb/mice immunized with VEE-VRP cocktails containing Lordsdale antigen. In addition, the levels of the heterotypic Lordsdale-specific serum IgG after trivalent immunization were significantly higher than combining each level of the heterotypic Lordsdale-specific serum IgG after monovalent (Norwalk, Hawaii, Snow Mountain antigen) immunization. This exciting finding suggests that NoV cocktail vaccines may protect against NoV strains not in the original immunization and therefore may be useful against new NoV variants. The new murine and Gn pig models will facilitate the testing of these multivalent vaccines against both homotypic and heterotypic infections.",

To date, three general types of delivery vehicles have been proposed: purified VLPs, VLPs in unicellular organisms, and VLPs in plants. High yields of VLPs can be purified from baculovirus [180] , yeast [184] , and Venezuelan equine encephalitis vectors [160] . VLPs could be administered as part of a unicellular organism like in yeast and Lactobacillus casei, but these VLP-expressing organisms have not been tested in human volunteers [184, 186] . VLPs have also been expressed in tomatoes [187] , potatoes [188, 189] , and tobacco [189] . All three NV VLP-expressing plants induced NV-specific antibodies when fed to mice [187, 189] . In CD1 mice, inoculation with tobacco expressing NV VLPs induced higher levels of NV-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA than inoculation with potato expressing VLPs [189] . Additionally, tomatoes expressing NV VLP still retained their ability to induce NVspecific antibodies after they were freeze-dried [187] . Of the three plants, only potatoes expressing NV VLP have been tested in human volunteers. Feeding of raw potatoes expressing NV VLP to volunteers was safe and induced no symptoms other than nausea in volunteers receiving wild type potatoes or potatoes expressing NV VLP [188] . Potatoes expressing NV VLP induced NV-specific serum IgG, IgA, and IgM, fecal IgA and seroconversion. The rise in NV-specific IgG titers persisted until day 61, the latest time point measured, while NV-specific IgM levels decreased to pre-immunization levels by day 28 [188] .

They are all easy to administer by the oral route, but purified VLPs have the highest likelihood of approval for immunization via nonoral routes. VLPs in unicellular organisms and plants may have higher acceptance by consumers, than purified VLPs, because they can be eaten and administered in foods that are commonly consumed (e.g. yogurts, beer, raw fruits and vegetables). In contrast, purified VLPs may be easier to standardize and assay for efficacy because there are less external factors that may affect the host immune system (e.g. other plant or unicellular proteins). Ultimately, there are several promising vaccine delivery vehicles available once a NoV vaccine has been shown to protect human volunteers from infection.",

This study addressed whether immunization with bovine NoV VLPs would protect Gn calves from infection with virulent bovine NoV (BoNoV) using BoNoV strain CV186-OH for both the VLP vaccine and challenge. This BoNoV is classified as GIII.2 NoV and has 45-50% amino acid sequence identity to GI NoV and 43-46% amino acid identity to GII NoV [53] . BoNoV VLPs were used to immunize 4-to 5-day-old Gn calves via the intramuscular, oral or intranasal routes in two or three doses. BoNoV VLPs were inoculated with different adjuvants including immunostimulating complexes (ISCOM), E. coli LT toxin (mLT, R192G) or oil (ISA50V). Immunized calves were then challenged with virulent BoNoV 20 days after immunization. As a positive control, a separate group of Gn calves were orally inoculated with one dose of virulent BoNoV (9 \u00d7 10 5 RT-PCR detectable units/calf) and orally re-inoculated with the same dose of virulent BoNoV 20 days after initial inoculation.",

Protection was evident (no diarrhea or viral shedding) upon subsequent re-inoculation with virulent BoNoV, suggesting that one dose of virulent BoNoV is sufficient to induce protective immunity from BoNoV infection and disease. Examination of the immune response of these calves revealed that both BoNoV-specific serum and fecal IgA and IgG antibody responses were induced after initial inoculation. Low titers of serum BoNoVspecific IgA antibodies were detected at 10 and 20 days after initial inoculation and at 10 days post-re-inoculation (30 days after the initial inoculation). The highest fecal NoV-specific IgA antibody GMT (1,280) was detected at 10 days post inoculation. Titers were maintained through 20 days post-inoculation and did not increase post-re-inoculation. Serum BoNoV-specific IgG antibodies reached a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 400 and 2,560 at 10 and 20 days after inoculation, respectively. Fecal BoNoV-specific IgG antibody titers decreased from a GMT of 240 to 30 between 10 and 20 days after inoculation.

This immunization regime induced lower BoNoV-specific serum IgA and IgG antibody titers and no BoNoV-specific fecal IgG compared to inoculation with virulent BoNoV. These immunized calves were the only vaccinated group that developed NoV-specific fecal IgA antibody responses. Gn calves immunized intramuscularly with two doses of the BoNoV VLPs (250 g/dose, 10 days apart) emulsified with oil adjuvant were not protected from diarrhea or infection after challenge, although they developed higher or similar serum IgA and IgG antibody titers, compared to calves that received virulent BoNoV.

Similarly, in human volunteers orally challenged with NV, mucosal (salivary) IgA antibody responses were associated with protection against NV infection [117] .
