However, because of the lack of effective re-medy for COVID-19, the recommended treatment for acutely ill patients are severely limited, with options for compassionate managements that include the use of Chinese herbs (National Health Commission of China, 2020). Although these strategies help many patients, especially in China, severe and especially critically ill patients are with a high risk of death. Recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs such as Arbidol have not shown significant therapeutic benefit and the effect of Remdesivir still needs more evidence (Grein et al., 2020) . Recent clinical observation suggests that Tocilizumab against interleukin 6 (IL-6), a major proinflammatory cytokine, to calm down the cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, could lead to therapeutic effects in a portion of patients . More recently, plasma of convalescent patients was used in Wuhan to manage refractory patients successfully, but the scope of this treatment is greatly constrained due to the limited supply of effective plasma.",

CQ and HCQ have been used to treat rheumatological and immunological diseases because of their inhibition of immunity and proinflammatory cytokines. CQ and HCQ also have antimicrobial effects and were used to treat infections by bacteria and viruses. Recently, HCQ was reported to be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell-based assays (Bian et al., 2020) , and treatment with HCQ was significantly associated with reduction and disappearance of viral load in COVID-19 patients in a small-sized sample (Gautret et al., 2020) , which instigated new hope for an effective treatment for COVID-19.",

These data suggest that HCQ treatment greatly lowered the inflammatory levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, we analyzed the change of IL-6 levels during the hospitalization period and found that oral HCQ treatment rapidly resulted in reducing IL-6 level and kept the lower level stable during therapy period. However, after HCQ treatment stopped, the IL-6 level went up to control level ( Figure 3) . Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of different IL-6 levels on death risk in response to HCQ treatment and found that when the IL-6 levels were higher than 60 pg mL -1 , patients were more severe. For patients with IL-6 levels higher than 60 pg mL -1 , HCQ treatment decreased IL-6 level from 100.0 (62.6-189.4) pg mL -1 to 28.4 (10.9-59.3) pg mL -1 after 5 days' treatment, and reached 9.8 (5.5-24.6) pg mL -1 after 10 days' treatment.

            "text": "COVID-19 patients displayed apparent immunity disorders, showing marked reduction in lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood and lymphatic tissues, but large amounts of lymphocyte infiltration in lungs as well as in other critical organs such as the heart. Many patients showed symptoms of cytokine storm with markedly elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, suggesting over-activated immune responses (Bian et al., 2020) . Anti-IL-6 antibody, Tocilizumab, has been shown to be an effective treatment option for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms (Luo et al., 2020) . In this study, we demonstrate that HCQ can mimic the effect of anti-IL-6 antibody by greatly redu-cing the levels of Il-6 in the critically ill COVID-19 patients. In addition, HCQ can modulate human inflammatory macrophage polarization via downregulating M1 but upregulating M2 macrophages (Shiratori et al., 2018; Sarzi-Puttini et al., 2020) , and inhibit proinflammatory cytokines through inhibition of lysosomal-autophagy pathways (He et al., 2011) and formation of double membrane vesicles (He et al., 2011; Plantone and Koudriavtseva, 2018) , a process required for genome replication by the SARS coronavirus replication complex (Snijder et al., 2006) . Thus, the anti-inflammatory action of HCQ in combination with its inhibitory activity of viral replication may contribute greatly to its therapeutic effects on critically ill COVID-19 patients. In addition, tissue distribution of HCQ is unique and favors therapy of pneumonia because it has much higher concentrations in the lungs (McChesney et al., 1967) . Importantly, the CQ class of drugs has been shown to repress inflammation with great synergy with low concentrations of glucocorticoids, one of the most potent classes of anti-inflammatory drugs, pointing to the possibility of combined therapy of HCQ with a low dose of glucocorticoids (He et al., 2011) .",

However, based on the results in these studies, it is very likely that they used high doses of HCQ, which might induce cardiotoxicity and death. They might also have used high doses of HCQ as antiviral agents rather than for antiinflammation. In contrast, the dose of HCQ used in the present study is much lower than that in previous studies but is the same as used for treating inflammatory diseases, and thus HCQ for COVID-19 patients works more likely as an agent for anti-inflammation and immunomodulation, rather than as a direct antiviral agent. Recently, Geleris et al. (2020) reported their observation study, showing that there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death. By carefully re-analyzing this report, however, we noticed that in this study, HCQ-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline (even if after propensity score-matched) than NHCQ-treated patients. In addition, the time of treatment for patients is too short (5 days) to show the efficacy of HCQ. Another concern of this study is that about 60% HCQ-treated patients received azithromycin simultaneously, which increases risk of QT-interval prolongation and sudden death.",

Therefore, despite the need for randomizeddouble blind control study, HCQ should be considered as an additional option to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, which could save lives during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Although this retrospective study was performed on critically ill COVID-19 patients, HCQ could also be an option for patients at an early stage considering its safety records and the long history of its use in treating malaria infections. This study has some limitations. For example, it is a retrospective study and HCQ treatment group only has 48 cases, much less than the number in NHCQ group.
