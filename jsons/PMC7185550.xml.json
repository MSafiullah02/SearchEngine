While R&D costs spiral higher, attrition statistics in clinical development show no signs of improvement and may actually be getting worse. For example, the FDA highlighted in March 2004 that a drug entering phase 1 clinical development in the year 2000 was less likely to reach the market than one that entered clinical development in 1985 [1]. It is a truism that much of the fate of a drug candidate in clinical development is embedded in the chemical structure and, hence, is in the control of the chemist at the point of design. Clearly, there are serious limitations on what drug designers have so far learnt about the relationship between chemical structure and attrition through clinical development.",

Indeed, there are a growing number of targets that we are trying to inhibit or activate for which we do understand the relationship between inhibition or activation of the target at the molecular level and their pathophysiological effect. Advances in structural and molecular biology, as well as in biophysics, have led to the determination of high-resolution atomic structures of many of the protein targets of drug discovery projects. For instance, p38 kinase is a target that is well validated in the clinic with respect to its role in inflammation, and many high-resolution crystal structures are available. The same is true for thrombin for anti-thrombosis and renin for hypertension, iNOS for inflammation, EGF receptor tyrosine kinase for cancer, as well as many antibacterial and antiviral targets. Crystal structures of some of the most important drug-metabolising enzymes are also known 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, which potentially enables the structure-based rational optimisation of potency, selectivity and metabolism. However, routine control of potency, selectivity and metabolism based on the use of structural information has yet to become a reality.",

Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is being applied to protein structural work and removes the limitation of molecular size but is still in its infancy. In other words, we are reliant on X-ray crystallography as the major source of structural information, and therefore this review focuses upon the use of protein and protein\u2013ligand structures derived by this technique.",

An obvious assumption is that the chemical composition of the ligand is known and that its placement in the active site and its conformation is correct. A corollary of (1) and (2) is that the interactions between the receptor and the ligand are known, understood and correct.(3)\nThe protein\u2013ligand structure is relevant for drug design. It is usually tacitly assumed that the conditions under which the complex was crystallised are relevant, that the observed protein conformation is relevant for interaction with the ligand (i.e. no flexibility in the active-site residues) and that the structure actually contributes insights that will lead to the design of better compounds.\n",

This usually occurs only if the resolution is low and if sensible procedures for model building, refinement and validation are jettisoned. However, it is important to remember that almost every crystal structure, even at atomic resolution, can have problematic parts or aspects [8]. Inspection of electron density together with the model (and preferably in the presence of the crystallographer!) may help in identifying any such parts and in assessing the reliability of the model in areas of particular interest (binding site, catalytic residues, interaction motifs, etc.). From 1 February 2008, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank have amended their deposition practices to require the deposition of structure factors as well as coordinates for all new structures. This means that all new publicly available structure models will be able to be viewed with the experimental data from which they were derived. The interested reader can obtain further information on good practice in the validation of protein structures from references 28, 29 and a tutorial is available at http://xray.bmc.uu.se/embo2001/modval/. Furthermore, one should keep in mind that \u2018high-resolution questions\u2019 (e.g. pertaining to non-bonded distances or the precise position, orientation and conformation of sidechains and other interesting moieties) can only be answered reliably when high-resolution data are available.

However, in an everyday structure-based design context other problems are likely to occur, and it is good to be aware of these pitfalls. Many of these problems have been discussed previously [8], such as difficulties involved in determining the orientation of asparagine, glutamine and histidine sidechains and in the assignment of density features to water molecules. Other problems may arise when the density for a ligand is poor and the placement of the ligand by the crystallographer is questionable (but perhaps not debated!). As a matter of fact, modellers can make an important contribution themselves to the structure determination of protein\u2013ligand complexes. First, their knowledge of organic chemistry and stereochemistry of small molecules is often better than that of a protein crystallographer, so the modellers could help formulate appropriate refinement dictionaries with proper restraints and target values for bond lengths, etc. Second, their knowledge of, and eye for, judging protein\u2013ligand interactions could help the crystallographer, by proposing ligand poses that both fit the electron density and make good sense in terms of protein\u2013ligand interactions.",

The structures revealed substantial pH-dependent conformational changes and an unexpected mode of binding for the substrate-analogue inhibitor [49].

However, a recent study of aldose reductase in complex with tolrestat and zopolrestat highlights that these assumptions are not necessarily valid [50]. The authors observed a flip of a peptide bond depending on whether zopolrestat was soaked in or co-crystallised. The peptide flip resulted in the rupture of a key hydrogen bond to the ligand. With tolrestat as the ligand, complexes with two different stoichiometries were obtained, one with one and one with four inhibitor molecules bound. Accommodation of four ligands caused appreciable shifts of two helices that interact with the additional ligands.",

In an attempt to crystallise the ternary complex of the enzyme with pantoate and NADPH, crystals were obtained but the density showed no traces of pantoate and only a fragment of NADPH could be located. This fragment was confirmed to be 2\u2032-phospho-ADP-ribose by mass-spectrometry experiments. Compared with the complex with NADP+, the ligand binds in the opposite orientation. Isothermal titration calorimetry with several mutants showed that the unusual binding mode is caused by changes in the protonation state of binding groups at low pH. The implication of this observation for fragment-based approaches to ligand design is that a binding mode may be altered profoundly by variations in crystallisation conditions as well as by (unexpected or intentional) modifications of ligands.",

Pharmacophore models based on either set of structures worked well in discriminating true and decoy inhibitors, but the model based on the NMR ensemble appeared to be the most accurate yet general representation of the active site. It is not clear whether the increased structural variation of the NMR ensemble reflects modelling of true dynamics or under-determination of the structure by the data.

A pair of thrombin inhibitors where the S3/S4 hydrophobic binding group is homologated from cyclopentyl to cyclohexyl gave identical binding affinities, instead of the expected increase in affinity of 3\u20134 kJ/mol for the incorporation of an additional methylene unit. X-ray crystallography showed that while the cyclopentyl group gave good density in the S3/S4 pocket, the cyclohexyl compound showed ill-defined density in the difference maps. This was interpreted as either static or dynamic disorder of the cyclohexyl group. ITC revealed that the equality of the Gibbs free energy between the two inhibitors was factored into very different enthalpic and entropic contributions. While the free energy of binding of the cyclopentyl compound was factored equally between entropy and enthalpy, the cyclohexyl compound showed a relatively larger entropic advantage in binding, compensated for by a weaker enthalpic contribution to binding. This is consistent with the observations from the crystallography. The high residual mobility of the cyclohexyl group results in the loss of good enthalpic contacts but is compensated by the smaller entropy penalty paid. While enthalpy\u2013entropy compensation is a generally observed phenomenon, reflecting the interplay between the enthalpic benefit from \u2018tight\u2019 interactions, to the entropic price paid to form them, it is still surprising that such subtle medicinal chemistry changes can result in such large unpredictable changes in the biophysics of the system, and such perfect compensation.",

Drug design requires careful control of these properties, while maintaining high target affinity.

These models provide a strong stimulus to chemical creativity, through the direct visualisation of the ligand\u2013receptor interactions. Such interactions are otherwise rather abstract to the medicinal chemist, whose only other alternative is to blindly feel his way forward using the tools of structure\u2013activity analysis. For users of X-ray crystal structure information, however, it is important to realise that a crystal structure is a model, a crystallographer's partly subjective interpretation of experimental data. This interpretation may be flawed, ambiguous or inaccurate in its details (and in rare cases in its entirety). The best way to assess to reliability of a model is to discuss it with the crystallographer who produced it, to examine the model alongside the experimental electron density and to put the model to the test through iterations of structure\u2013activity work.",
