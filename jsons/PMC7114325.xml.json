The SARS-CoV genome encompasses 29,727 nucleotides and the genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003a). SARS-CoV genome expression starts with the translation of two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), which are encoded by the viral replicase gene (21,221 nt) that comprises ORFs 1a and 1b. The remaining twelve ORFs encode the four structural proteins, S, M, N and E, and eight accessory proteins (Thiel et al., 2003a, Ziebuhr, 2004).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV drug discovery requires the development of reliable biological assays. Traditional antiviral assays for coronavirus are based on viral infection of cultured cells, followed by monitoring of compound inhibition of viral replication through observation of cytopathic effects, quantification of viral yields by plaque assay, or measurement of viral RNA by reverse transcription-PCR (Ivens et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2004). The virus can infect many cell types and produces plaques (Hofmann and P\u00f6hlmann, 2004). However, the requirement that infectious virus work be carried out under Biosafety Level 3 conditions makes it more difficult to use live virus assays in high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify antiviral compounds. The low-throughput nature of these assays limits their use for the screening of compound libraries. The availability of reverse genetic systems for many coronavirus (cDNA clones for infectious full-length genomes and for subgenomic replicons) has made it possible to develop novel assays for HTS (Thiel et al., 2003b, Yount et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2003). In principle, a reporter gene such as GFP could be engineered into a full-length virus and into a subgenomic replicon. Infection or transfection of susceptible cells with such a reporting virus or replicon results in the expression of GFP. The level of GFP fluorescence would reflect the extent of viral replication and could be used to monitor the suppression of viral infection by potential inhibitors (Ge et al., 2007, Hertzig et al., 2004).",

Here we report the utilization of this cell line in a 96-well format high-throughput screen, and report on our initial success in using this assay to identify compounds with antiviral activity from a screen of a library of 7035 compounds. From this screen we have identified seven small molecules that reduced the GFP fluorescence, as well as SARS-CoV protein and RNA synthesis in the SARS-CoV replicon cells. The efficacies of these compounds against SARS-CoV infection in Vero cells have also been measured by a plaque reduction assay (PRA). In addition, the target of one of the hit compounds, C12344, was validated by the generation of resistant replicon cells and the identification of the mutations conferring the drug-resistant phenotype.",

The degree of protection offered by the test compounds against SARS-CoV infection was measured by plaque reduction assay. Briefly, one hundred plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV were added to individual wells of 24-well tissue culture plates seeded with a monolayer of Vero cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells per well) in DMEM with 1% FBS. After a 1 h incubation, the inocula were removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). One millilitre of overlay (1% low-melting agarose in DMEM with 1% FBS and either lacking test compound or with different concentrations of compounds) was added to each well. After 48 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2, the culture medium was removed and the cells in the culture plate were fixed with a 10% formalin solution and stained with crystal violet solution. The plaque number was then counted. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was defined as the concentration at which the plaque number was reduced to half of that in cells cultured without addition of antiviral drugs. The same experiment was performed three times independently for each drug and the IC50 values were calculated as the average \u00b1standard deviation (S.D.) of the three experiments. All procedures involving manipulation of live SARS-CoV were carried out in a biological safety level 3 containment laboratory.",

            "text": "We have recently described a cell line (SCR-1) that stably expresses a SARS-CoV replicon that encodes a GFP reporter gene and a blasticidin-resistant gene (Fig. 1A). It allows viral replication to be monitored by simply measuring the fluorescence intensity in the cells. To adapt a GFP-expressing replicon cell line (SCR-1) into an HTS assay, we initially determined a linear range of reporting cells for seeding of the 96-well plates. Selection of an appropriate cell number per well is critical because cell density could affect the replication efficiency of the replicon, and analysis of inhibitors requires quantification of a decrease in the steady-state level of replicon RNA. To examine the effects of cell density, SCR-1 cells were seeded at densities ranging from 5000 to 60,000 cells/well. The fluorescence signal correlated closely with cell number (Fig. 1B). We were able to consistently produced easily measurable fluorescence signals at a density of 30,000 cells/well, so this density was selected for the HTS assay. Furthermore, at this density the cells did not become overly confluent during the assay, a condition in which replicon copy number might be adversely affected (Pietschmann et al., 2001). We next examined the effect of cell passage on fluorescence intensity and showed that the activity was stable for at least 10 passages (data not shown). All HTS assays were performed with cells that were within 5 passages from the original frozen stocks (passage 25\u201330 from colony selection). The impact of DMSO concentration was also examined; the results revealed that the cells tolerated 0.5% DMSO, but there was a slight decrease in the fluorescence signal when 2% DMSO was used (data not shown). Therefore, in the HTS assay the DMSO concentration was limited to 0.5%. Under this experimental condition, the assay window (GFP fluorescence signal from replicon-bearing cells divided by the background signal from na\u00efve BHK-21 cells) consistently ranged from 1 \u00d7 104 to 1 \u00d7 105 (data not shown). The results suggest that the replicon-containing cell line could be used in an HTS assay.",

The specificity of the antibody against the SARS-CoV nsp5 was first confirmed using Western blot analysis, which showed that the SARS-CoV proteins were present in the replicon cells but not in the parental BHK-21 cells (Fig. 3A). In the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 3B, total cell proteins were prepared from SARS-CoV replicon cells treated with the candidate compounds and the viral protein nsp5 was detected with the anti-nsp5 (3CLpro) antibody. The same blots were stripped and probed for beta-actin to show equal loading. As shown in Fig. 3B, all of the compounds had minimal effect on the beta-actin level, which is consistent with the MTT data showing that these compounds are not cytotoxic at the 10 \u03bcM concentration used. The Western blot data demonstrate that the tested compounds all reduced SARS-CoV nsp5 protein level in replicon cells after 48 h drug treatment. Dose dependency is also clearly seen with several compounds, e.g. C12344 and C26505 (structures shown in Table 1). However, a few compounds reduced viral protein only at 10 \u03bcM, the highest concentration used. Examples include C03455 and C11472 (Table 1). Comparison of these Western blot data with the IC50 data determined with the FACS assay, demonstrated a reasonably good correlation between fluorescence reduction and viral protein reduction.

To validate the target of C12344, the chemical-resistant replicon cells were selected and the genetic mutations conferring the resistant phenotype were identified. Briefly, the SARS-CoV replicon cells were plated in six-well plates and in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin and 5 \u03bcM of C12344.

For cells recovered in the presence of antiviral agents, the nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro cDNA were determined after RNA extraction and RT-PCR, as described previously (Ge et al., 2007). Two resistance variations against C12344 were identified to be substitutions of Lys61 with Ile (K61I) and Asn119 with His (N119H).

Preliminary candidate compounds were defined by their ability to reduce GFP fluorescence activity by more than 50%. These preliminary candidates were validated by retesting, and demonstrating absence of cytotoxicity, which would also have reduced GFP fluorescence in the replicon-bearing cells.

All these compounds show a potential for further optimization into potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV and merit detailed characterization regarding mechanism of action. At present, only the target of C12344 has been validated by the generation of resistant replicon cells and the identification of the mutations conferring the drug-resistant phenotype, the mechanisms of action for the remaining six candidate compounds are not known. Whether the compounds are targeting a viral protein or a cellular process that is involved in SARS-CoV replication is not clear. To assess some of these aspects in vitro, we are establishing SARS-CoV 3CLpro and helicase assays to investigate whether the compounds can inhibit these enzymatic activities.

We demonstrated that such resistant variations have been selected in vitro against the SARS-CoV 3CLpro specific inhibitor C12433. Therefore, despite the potent anti-SARS-CoV activity of C12433 demonstrated in the replicon cells, the optimal therapy could still involve the combination of C12433 with other antiviral agents. This has been best illustrated with the treatment for HIV, where the combination of three or more drugs of various mechanisms is absolutely necessary to continuously suppress viral replication and the emergence of resistance. In future, we will examine whether the effect of the combination of several drugs was additive or synergistic. Also we are going to investigate whether incubation of the replicon cells with a combination of several drugs would help suppress the emergence of these in vitro resistance variations against C12433.",

This screening system meets the requirements of a successful high-throughput assay such as minimal manipulation after assay set-up, low sample volume and automated detection of end-point. This system offers considerable benefits from a first round of screening regarding selectivity, specificity and toxicity of the compound, resulting in an improved data set from an initial screen in comparison with existing assays based on simpler observation such as plaque formation or analysis of CPE. This system, with its ease of handling and good level of safety is well suited to drug discovery against the SARS-CoV, and should be applicable to other emerging high-risk pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, the compounds we have identified may be useful research tools in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV replication and viral host interaction.",
