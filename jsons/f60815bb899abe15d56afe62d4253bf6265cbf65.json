Soon after the start of the epidemic, the so-called \"double-diagnosis, double-buffering, and double-mode\" model was implemented throughout Hubei province.In addition, patients who develop a fever after surgery or during hospitalization must be closely monitored. The origin of the fever should be identified based on signs, symptoms, blood test results (especially lymphocyte counts), changes in inflammatory indicators, and imaging study results. Patients with fever and respiratory symptoms should be isolated in accordance with the procedures for suspected COVID-19. Additionally, lung computed tomography and a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing should be performed.The presence of COVID-19 should be appropriately assessed before surgery and other emergency operations in orthopedics. Patients should not undergo surgery without prior disease screening, with the exception of surgeries that are necessary to avoid endangering life and physical function. The indications for emergency surgery should be stricter than usual during a pandemic.

Rapid and effective measures are recommended to stabilize the orthopedic condition and switch the treatment to a limited or elective surgery, which can achieve the same goals as if surgery was performed.Patients with diabetic foot ulcers of Wagner grade\u2160-\u2162 have small ulcers and mild infections.Regardless of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms, conservative treatment and small-scale debridement can be performed according to the needs of the patient. In patients with diabetic foot ulcers of Wagner grade \u2163-V, irreversible injury and necrosis have already occurred. As the infection progresses, toxin absorption leads to severe liver and kidney dysfunction. To save the lives of patients who cannot be stabilized by non-surgical treatment, amputation must be performed. Patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms can tolerate more extensive or longer operations, which can be performed according to surgical plans under the three-level protection measures in a \"negative pressure operating room\". For patients with severe or critical COVID-19, it is necessary to fully evaluate the potential risks and benefits of surgery, which cannot be tolerated by all patients. Operations are mainly intended as life-saving treatments, and can include debridement or amputation if appropriate. If patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must undergo surgery, multidisciplinary cooperation should be implemented on the basis of prevention and control. The procedure should be negotiated with relevant departments such as anesthesiology, operating room staff, endocrinology, and the intensive care unit to implement individualized diagnosis and treatment plans. Surgery should be performed in a designated hospital under protective conditions. The operation should be performed in a negative-pressure operating room, where negative pressure",
