            "text": "The anatomy and the cell types of the respiratory tract dictate to a large degree the type of disease observed during respiratory virus infection. The demarcation between the upper and lower respiratory tracts is the vocal cords. The structures of the upper respiratory tract, which are all interconnected, include the nasopharynx, the larynx, the Eustachian tube and middle ear space, and the sinuses. Significant collections of lymphoid tissue reside in the upper respiratory tract, the tonsils and the adenoids. The lower respiratory tract structures include the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, and lung tissue. The cell types that line the respiratory tract are complex, and exhibit different susceptibilities to virus infection. The predominant cell types are ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells, and Clara cells. Smooth muscle cells are prominent features of the airways down to the level of the bronchioles, and the lung possesses type I and II pneumocytes. The pathologic process of wheezing is driven mostly at the level of bronchioles by smooth muscle contraction and obstruction caused by mucous accumulation and epithelial sloughing. Pneumonia is infection of the pneumocytes, which are deeper in the tissue.",

Different viruses appear to have tropisms for different cells or regions of the respiratory tract; therefore, there are particular associations of viruses with clinical syndromes. The clinical diagnoses for infections with disease manifestations in the respiratory tract are rhinitis and the common cold, sinusitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tracheitis, acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and exacerbations of reactive airway disease or asthma. Clinical syndromes with more systemic illness due to respiratory viruses include the influenza syndrome, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).",

The landmark studies of association of viruses with clinical syndromes were performed in the 1960s and 1970s. Recent studies have increased our understanding of the causes of viral respiratory infection in infants, especially because of the advent of molecular tests such as reverse transcription combined with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is more sensitive than cell culture. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses, and influenza viruses were identified initially as the most common causes of serious lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children. More recently, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified as a major cause of serious illness. In the last 10 years, a number of additional viruses have been associated with respiratory illness, as discussed below. However, infectious agents still are not identified in 30\u201350% of clinical illnesses in large surveillance studies, even using sensitive diagnostic techniques such as viral culture on multiple cell lines, antigen detection assays, and RT-PCR based methods. It is not known if these illnesses are due to identified pathogens that are simply not detected due to low titers of virus in patient samples or if there are novel agents that are yet to be identified.",

            "text": "\nRhinovirus is a genus of the family Picornaviridae of viruses. Rhinoviruses are the most common viral infective agents in humans, and a causative agent of the common cold. There are over 100 serologic virus types, also classified by a large number of genotypes that cause cold symptoms. In 2014, the species Rhinovirus A contained 80 types, species Rhinovirus B had 32 types, and species Rhinovirus C 54 types. Rhinoviruses are responsible for half or more of all cases of the common cold. Rhinoviruses have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes. The viral particles are icosahedral in structure, and they are non-enveloped. Rhinovirus-induced common colds may be complicated in children by otitis media and in adults by sinusitis. Most adults, in fact, have radiographic evidence of sinusitis during the common cold, which resolves without therapy. Therefore the primary disease is probably best termed rhinosinusitis. Rhinovirus infection is associated with exacerbations of reactive airway disease in children and asthma in adults. It is not clear whether rhinovirus is restricted to the upper respiratory tract and induces inflammatory responses that affect the lower respiratory tract indirectly, or whether the viruses spread to the lower respiratory tract. In the past, it was thought that these viruses did not often replicate or cause disease in the lower respiratory tract. However, recent studies discern strong epidemiological associations of RVs with wheezing and asthma exacerbations, including episodes severe enough to require hospitalization. Likely, rhinoviruses can infect the lower airways to some degree, inducing a local inflammatory response. Another possibility is that significant local infection of the upper respiratory tract might induce regional elaboration of mediators that causes lower airways disease. Association of rhinovirus infection with lower respiratory tract illness is difficult to study because diagnosis by cell culture is not sensitive. RT-PCR diagnostic tests are difficult to interpret because they are often positive for prolonged periods of time and even asymptomatic individuals may have a positive test. Comprehensive serologies to confirm infection are difficult because of the large number of serotypes. Nevertheless, most experts believe rhinoviruses are a common cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness.",

It is one of the most infectious viruses of humans and infects infants at a very young age, often in the first weeks or months of life. It is the most common viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in children and one of the most important causes of hospitalization in infants and children throughout the world. There is one serotype, but circulating viruses exhibit an antigenic dimorphism such that there are two antigenic subgroups designated A and B. Reciprocal cross-neutralization studies using human sera showed that the antigenic groups are about 25% related. Reinfection is common and can be caused by viruses of the same subgroup. Yearly, epidemics of disease often peak between December and March in temperate regions. RSV infection causes mild upper respiratory tract infection in most infants and young children, but results in hospitalization in 0.5\u20131% of infants due to wheezing or pneumonia. Most children have been infected by the age of 2 years. There is an association of RSV infection early in life and subsequent asthma, although a causal relationship is controversial. Most hospitalized infants were otherwise healthy prior to infection, but some groups are considered at high risk for severe disease such as premature infants, especially those with chronic lung disease, and infants born with congenital heart disease. Immunocompromised patients of any age are at risk of severe disease. Severe disease is also common in the elderly, especially institutionalized frail elderly.",

Evidence of near universal seroconversion was found in the general population by 5 years of age, suggesting ubiquitous infection in early childhood. This virus, a member of the genus Pneumovirus with RSV, differs from RSV in that it lacks the NS1 and NS2 nonstructural genes that counteract host interferons and it possesses a slightly different gene order. Studies of the role of hMPV in pediatric lower respiratory tracts infection (LRI) in otherwise healthy children in the United States, using a prospectively collected 25-year database and sample archive representing about 2000 children, revealed that nearly 12% of LRI in children was associated with a positive hMPV test. This and similar studies suggested that the virus is one of the major respiratory pathogens of early childhood. The clinical features of hMPV LRI were similar to those of other paramyxoviruses, most often resulting in cough, coryza, and a syndrome of bronchiolitis or croup. Interestingly, hMPV seemed to be clinically intermediate between RSV and PIV in that it tended to cause bronchiolitis with similar frequency to RSV but more frequently than PIV, while causing croup less often than the latter. Studies in subjects with conditions predisposing to increased risk of respiratory illness suggest that hMPV plays a significant role in exacerbations of asthma in children and adults, LRI in immunocompromised subjects, and in the frail and elderly.",

Nipah virus is a newly recognized zoonotic virus, named after the location in Malaysia where it was first identified in 1999. It has caused disease in humans with contact with infectious animals. Hendra virus (formerly called equine morbillivirus) is another closely related zoonotic paramyxovirus that was first isolated in Australia in 1994. The viruses have caused only a few localized outbreaks, but their wide host range and ability to cause high mortality raise concerns for the future. The natural host of these viruses is thought to be a certain species of fruit bats present in Australia and the Pacific. Pigs may be an intermediate host for transmission to humans in Nipah infection, and horses in the case of Hendra. Although the mode of transmission from animals to humans is not defined, it is likely that inoculation of infected materials onto the respiratory tract plays a role.

            "text": "Influenza is a single-stranded segmented negative-sense RNA genome virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. There are three types of influenza viruses: influenza virus A, influenza virus B, and influenza virus C. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B infects humans almost exclusively. The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types, and cause the most severe disease. The influenza A virus can be subdivided into different subtypes based on the antibody response to these viruses. The subtypes that have been confirmed in humans in seasonal influenza, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are: H1N1 which caused the 1918 pandemic, and H2N2 which caused the 1957 pandemic of avian influenza that originated in China, H3N2 which caused the pandemic of 1968. Currently, H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses cause annual seasonal epidemics. In addition, H5N1 virus infection of humans occurred during an epizootic of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong's poultry population in 1997. The disease affected animals of many species and exhibited a high rate of mortality in humans. The virus is spreading throughout Asia and beyond, carried by wild birds. Human-to-human transmission does not occur efficiently at this time; however, there is widespread current concern about the potential for an H5N1 pandemic if the virus acquired transmissibility among humans. The H7N7 avian virus also has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 this virus caused an outbreak in humans in the Netherlands associated with an outbreak in commercial poultry on several farms. One death occurred and 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection. A significant outbreak of H7N9 virus began in China in March 2013, with high mortality. H1N2 virus appears to endemic in pigs and humans. An H3N2 variant virus endemic in pigs sporadically infects humans with close contact, such as at state fairs in the US. H9N2, H7N2, H7N3, H10N7, and H10N8 human infections have been reported. Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. It mutates less rapidly than influenza A, and there is only one influenza B subtype, although there are currently two major lineages that exhibit antigenic differerences (Fujian-like viruses and B/Shanghai-like strains). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection and syndrome are fever, sore throat, myalgias, headache, cough, and fatigue. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. Influenza pneumonia has an unusually high rate of complication by bacterial superinfection with staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterial pneumonia occurring in as many as 10% of cases in some clinical series.",

Adenoviruses were first isolated in human lymphoid tissues from surgically removed adenoids, hence the name of the virus. In fact, some serotypes establish persistent asymptomatic infections in tonsil and adenoid tissues, and virus shedding can occur for months or years. These double-stranded DNA viruses are less than 100 nm in size, and have non-enveloped icosahedral morphology. The large dsDNA genome is linear and non-segmented. There are seven major human adenovirus species (designated A through G) that can be placed into 57 immunologically distinct serotypes. Human respiratory tract infections are mainly caused by the B and C species. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year. Sporadic outbreaks occur with many of the serotypes, while others appear to be endemic in particular locations. Respiratory illnesses include mild disease such as the common cold and lower respiratory tract illness, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Conjunctivitis is associated with infection by species B and D. There is a particular constellation of symptoms called \u2018pharyngo-conjunctival fever\u2019 which is very frequently associated with acute adenovirus infection. In contrast, gastroenteritis has been associated most frequently with the serotype 40 and 41 virus of species F. Immunocompromised subjects are highly susceptible to severe disease during infection with respiratory adenoviruses. The syndrome of acute respiratory disease (ARD), especially common during stressful or crowded living conditions, was first recognized among military recruits during World War II and continues to be a problem for the military following suspension of vaccination. ARD is most often associated with adenovirus types 4 and 7.",

            "text": "Members of the genus Coronavirus also contribute to respiratory illness including severe disease. There are dozens of coronaviruses that affect animals. In the twentieth century, only two representative strains of human coronaviruses were known to cause disease, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-OC43. An outbreak of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) showed that animal coronaviruses have the potential to cross species to humans with devastating effects. There has been one major epidemic to date, between November 2002 and July 2003, with over 8000 cases of the disease, and mortality rates approaching 10%. SARS-CoV causes a systemic illness with a respiratory route of entry. SARS is a unique form of viral pneumonia. In contrast to most other viral pneumonias, upper respiratory symptoms are usually absent in SARS, although cough and dyspnea occur in most patients. Typically, patients present with a nonspecific illness manifesting fever, myalgia, malaise, and chills or rigors; watery diarrhea may occur as well. Investigators reported the identification of a fourth human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, a new group 1 coronavirus. Evidence is emerging that HCoV-NL63 is a common respiratory pathogen of humans, causing both upper and lower respiratory tract illness. Human coronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 was first described in January 2005 following detection in a patient with pneumonia. Several cases of respiratory illness have been associated with the virus, but the infrequent identification suggests to date that this putative group 2 coronavirus causes a low incidence of illness. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first isolated in 2012, causes severe disease in humans.

Fomite transmission occurs indirectly when infected respiratory droplets are deposited on hands or on inanimate objects and surfaces with subsequent transfer of secretions to a susceptible subject's nose or conjunctiva. Most respiratory viruses, unlike measles virus or varicella zoster virus, do not spread by small particle aerosols across rooms or down halls. Therefore, contact and droplet precautions are sufficient to prevent transmission in most settings; handwashing is critical in healthcare settings during the winter season.",

            "text": "There are licensed vaccines for influenza viruses. In the US, trivalent and quadrivalent (H3N2, H1N1, and one or two B antigen) inactivated intramuscular vaccine and a live attenuated trivalent vaccine for intranasal administration are available. The efficacy of these vaccines is good when the vaccine strains chosen are highly related antigenically to the epidemic strain. Antigenic drift caused by point mutations in the HA and NA molecules leads to antigenic divergence, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. The influenza genome is segmented, which allows reassortment of two viruses to occur during co-infection, which sometimes leads to a major antigenic shift resulting in a pandemic. Pandemics occur every 20\u201330 years on average. There is current concern about the potential for an H5N1 or H7N9 pandemic, and experimental vaccines are being tested for these viruses. To date, H5N1 vaccines have been poorly immunogenic compared to comparable seasonal influenza vaccines, but adjuvants improve immunogenicity. Vaccines were developed for adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7, and these were approved for preventing epidemic respiratory illness among military recruits. Essentially, these were unmodified viruses given by the enteric route in capsules, instead of the respiratory route, which is the natural route of infection leading to disease. Inoculation by the altered route resulted in an immunizing asymptomatic infection. All US military recruits were vaccinated against adenovirus from 1971 to 1999 with near complete prevention of the disease in this population, but the sole manufacturer of the vaccine halted production in 1996 and supplies ran out 3 years later. Since 1999, adenovirus infection has reemerged as a significant problem in the military with approximately 10% of all recruits suffering illness due to adenovirus infection during basic training; some deaths have occurred. Live attenuated vaccine candidates are under development and being tested in phase I and II clinical trials for RSV and the PIVs. Mutant strains with reduced pathogenicity were isolated in the laboratory, tested, and sequenced. Now, vaccine candidates are being optimized by combining mutations from separate biologically derived viruses into single strains using recombinant techniques for generating RNA viruses from cDNA copies, a process called reverse genetics. Subunit vaccines have been developed for RSV, but there are safety concerns about their use in young infants because formalin inactivated vaccine induced a more severe disease response to infection in the 1960s. Subunit RSV vaccines likely will be tested in the setting of maternal immunization shortly. There are no vaccines against rhinoviruses as there is little or no cross-protection between serotypes, and it is not feasible to develop a vaccine for over 100 serotypes. Efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines are in the preclinical stage.",
