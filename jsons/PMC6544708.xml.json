It is caused by a number of pathogens, although coronaviruses and rhinoviruses are among the most prevalent [2]. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of these viruses may differ, it is believed that many common cold symptoms are mediated through the release of proinflammatory substances in response to viral infection [3, 4]. Rather than targeting viral infection and proliferation, most current treatments for the common cold are directed at individual symptoms, such as congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, fever, sore throat, and cough [5\u20138].",

Accordingly, pretreatment or post-treatment at 12 h after virus challenge with tremacamra, a recombinant soluble ICAM-1, was shown to be effective as prophylaxis of symptoms of experimental rhinovirus infection [10]; however, the study did not determine whether tremacamra was effective when given after symptom onset [10].",

Carbomer gels have been studied as a component of microbicides for prevention of transmission of other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections [13\u201315].

            "text": "Although 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray was well-tolerated, it failed to reduce symptoms of the common cold. The failure to demonstrate any clinical benefit in the efficacy study was not likely due to a lack of statistical power, as a sample size of 150\u2013200 subjects was considered sufficient based on prior studies using products with a similar proposed mechanism of action [16\u201318]. The results were flat (i.e., not even a trend in favor of 0.5% carbomer). The NSS and TSS, which comprised the primary and secondary endpoints of the efficacy study, have been widely used in studies of allergic rhinitis and have been shown to be sensitive tools [19\u201323]. These scores have been less extensively used in the common cold, but their use in some studies has demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms [5, 18, 24\u201326]. While the common cold is generally more prevalent in colder months, it can occur all year round. It is therefore possible that the lack of clinical benefit of carbomer 980 in our study may be due to the seasonal variability of the pathogens responsible for the common cold [27, 28]. For example, rhinoviruses, which are among the predominate causes of the common cold [1, 2], are genetically diverse and appear to circulate with seasonal variation [27]. Moreover, although subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis were excluded, subjects with springtime allergies may not have mentioned them, particularly since screening for study 2 began in winter, when seasonal allergies are not top of mind [1, 2, 27].",

It is also possible that preventing further viral replication with 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray would have been more effective at preventing or reducing symptoms if given earlier in the course of illness.

Across the two studies, the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the active treatment arm than in the placebo arm. Multiple administrations of 0.5% carbomer 980 gel were well-tolerated with regard to local nasal tolerability, with no mucosal grading higher than grade 1B and low incidences of mild mucosal bleeding and crusting. The use of a conservative grading scale in the local nasal tolerability study likely led to a higher reporting of nasal irritation than observed in the efficacy study. Overall, most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The only serious AE that occurred in either study was unrelated to study treatment. Laboratory variables, vital signs, and physical examinations did not reveal any clinically significant effects of 0.5% carbomer 980 gel treatment.",
