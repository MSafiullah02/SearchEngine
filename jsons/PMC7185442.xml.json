In addition, HRVs have been implicated in severe lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia [11], [12], [13], [14]. In recent years, important insights have been gained into the diversity of rhinoviruses and the spectrum of disease they cause [15], [16], [17], [18]. Currently, there are 3 recognized species of HRVs: A, B and C, and these include approximately 100 prototypic genotypes. Viruses within this group were also classified based upon host receptor binding- Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 (major group) vs. low density lipoprotein (LDL, minor group)- and reactivity to capsid-binding antiviral compounds types 1(A) vs. 2(B) [19], [20], [21], [22]. Diversity is attributed in part to the error rate of the viral RNA polymerase which is estimated at 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 errors/nucleotide/cycle over the entire open reading frame [23]. Recombination resulting in new types has also been described [24], [25].",

VP1 sequences from the clinical isolates were 98% identical to HRV-A1 sequences deposited in GenBank and not sufficiently divergent to constitute a new variant [35]. Initially, an HRV-A21 virus circulated in one of the nursing units. This was rapidly replaced by the dominating HRV-A1 virus.

In contrast, partial sequence analysis of viruses revealed single types were responsible for LTCH outbreaks reported in the literature [6], [8], [32]. Among household members, multiple types of HRVs have been shown to co-circulate simultaneously [30]. This is the first study we are aware of where multiple HRV genotypes have been implicated in a LTCH outbreak. VP1 region sequencing provided better resolution and was able to genotype 3 HRVs which were only identified to the species level by 5\u2032 UTR sequencing. Recombination cannot be ruled out in the case of the type identified as a species B by 5\u2032 UTR analysis without further sequencing. In this outbreak, genotyping also revealed the dominant type was a HRV-A1, which is a minor receptor binding and antiviral group 2 reactive type. With respect to pathogenicity, HRVs species A and C have been implicated more in clinical disease and severity compared to species B [17], [26], [27], [36]. In addition, it has been proposed that HRV types possessing type 2 (or B) antiviral binding sites may cause more clinical disease [21]. The mean viral loads of a subset of samples from this outbreak were comparable to those of children and university students; these data have been published elsewhere [37].",

            "text": "Genotyping also revealed aspects of transmission dynamics which would have otherwise been overlooked. The HRV 21-like virus circulated early in the outbreak among residents on units where the general level of activity tends to be lower. Thus, residents infected with HRV-A21 virus may have been more likely to remain on their units, limiting the spread of this type. The more extensive spread of HRV-A1 may have been due to host characteristics such as level of activity, as opposed to a viral fitness advantage. Unfortunately, there are no animal models in which to study transmission dynamics and compare dispersion fitness of HRVs. At this point it is not known whether HRV genotypes differ with respect to transmission efficiency or optimal mode of transmission. Past human experimental work and epidemiological studies suggest that fomites and droplet aerosols are routes for transmission of HRVs, though there are conflicting data regarding the contribution of fomites to transmission [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Of note, effective transmission may not be linked to a highly virulent phenotype [43], since less symptomatic hosts are more likely to interact with susceptibles, facilitating dispersion. We speculate this may partially explain the extent of this outbreak in this highly vulnerable population. It is important to also consider the possibility that patients with cognitive impairment may not observe infection control precautions to the same extent as other residents, potentially facilitating the spread of the virus. Finally, it is well-recognized that HRVs frequently infect HCWs [44] and HCWs have been implicated in the spread of HRVs in other settings such as a neonatal intensive care unit [45]. Infected HCWs circulating between units and wings may account for the rapid and widespread dispersion of the HRV-A1 type, underscoring the importance for HCWs to observe healthy workplace policies and remain at home when unwell.",

In addition, the size of the outbreak may be underestimated: individuals with subclinical disease would not have been screened, and some individuals who were screened may have had suboptimal samples. The genotypes of viruses infecting asymptomatic residents are unknown and may differ; it is also not possible to consider the role asymptomatics may have had in viral transmission.",

This study provides further evidence of the impact of HRV outbreaks in LTCH residents, and highlights the importance of effective infection prevention and control. Finally, we conclude that genotyping is an excellent tool to further our understanding of transmission dynamics and virulence.",
