However, such strategy is difficult to follow in developing countries, due to lack of surveillance resources, appropriate technology, and funds. In addition, the poorer countries carry a higher risk of increased morbidity and mortality due to overcrowding and large population sizes and densities. Furthermore, lack of accurate diagnostic methods places them in a more vulnerable situation due to inadequate source identification. Individual behaviors such as self\u2010isolation, social distancing, and accessing health care only if symptoms are severe, may be lacking in poorer countries due to inadequate information and illiteracy. Dispersion of misinformation and false beliefs are also more common.\n4\n\n",

This is in sharp contrast to developed countries like Italy, whose transparency helps developing appropriate strategies.",
