In this article, we propose a novel parsimonious scalar-on-image classification model adopting the ideas of functional data analysis. Our main idea is to treat images as functional measurements and exploit underlying covariance structures to select basis functions; these bases are then used in approximating both image profiles and corresponding regression coefficient. We re-express the regression model into a standard generalized linear model where the functional principal component scores are treated as covariates. We apply the method to (1) classify pneumonia against healthy and viral against bacterial pneumonia patients, and (2) test the null effect about the association between images and responses. Extensive simulation studies show excellent numerical performance in terms of classification, hypothesis testing, and efficient computation.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is a form of an acute respiratory illness affecting the lungs. Though pneumonia can occur at any age, younger children are most vulnerable. Bacteria, viruses, or fungi can categorize the common causes of pneumonia. In all these cases, children experience breathing difficulty as their lungs get contaminated with pus and fluid, which results in the inflammation of air sacs limiting the oxygen intake. Pediatric pneumonia is the primary cause of fatality that claims 3 million children globally every year, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) [51] . Unfortunately, the majority of these deaths were preventable and occurred due to the lack of proper immunization, adequate nutrition, and the availability of antibiotic treatments. The developing countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, suffer most and have the majority of death tolls. The developed countries still suffer substantially from the burden of disease, with 2.5 million incidences yearly leading a third to a half of these to hospitalizations incurring high healthcare-associated costs; see [3; 20; 11] . Very recently, with the discovery of the pneumococcal vaccine, the risk of pneumonia in the United States has been reduced substantially. In contrast, the developed countries are yet to avail such measures, and they have been working strenuously to achieve the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) under the supervision of the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF.",

            "text": "The clinical signs or symptoms for pneumonia are often nonspecific and vary based on the patient's physical characteristics. Accurate and timely diagnosis is the key to fight pneumonia. The current state-of-the-art diagnostic approaches include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, culture, complete blood cell (CBC), chest radiography, and ultrasonography based test. Some of these tests require advanced lab facilities and are not entirely immune from producing false negatives. The PCR test is widely used but requires 24-48 hours to get back the diagnostic results and often requires close contact to collect the specimens from the suspected individuals manually, which is risky and has a high chance of transmitting infectious diseases like COVID-19. Recently, chest X-rays have shown a lot of promise and been used in diagnosis or as a confirmatory test for pneumonia [30; 28] . Such medical images need to be interpreted by radiologists to detect appropriately any abnormalities; unfortunately, this is often a manual, time-consuming step, and requires experts with domain-knowledge to diagnose. Therefore, there is a need for intelligent decision support that can empower and augment clinical decision making, which in turn saves time and prevents physicians' burnout and morbidity. Such a tool, if developed, may classify, flag, or confirm pneumonia-like patients using radiography images or can even stratify symptomatic patients into different risk categories as needed; see [2; 27; 53; 50; 52; 16] and many others.",

            "text": "Deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been used extensively in studying radiology images and detecting patients [27] . While AI works well in prediction, it requires a substantially large dataset to train the machine learning model, which may not always be feasible. Besides, such an approach does not offer flexibility to either make inference about the parameters of interest or quantify uncertainty in estimation. Very recently, statistical-based methodologies have been applied in neuroimaging; see [45; 26; 22; 54; 42] and many others. [39; 26; 22] adopted Bayesian spatial modeling approaches to model the correlation between neighboring voxels with carefully placing priors on brain regions in predicting adverse clinical outcomes of Alzheimer's disease. In a similar spirit, [46; 18; 45] fitted univariate linear regressions on each region of interest of brain image separately to explore the relationship between images and scalar measures. While most of these methods primarily focus on prediction, the inferential aspects of parameter estimates are not discussed explicitly. [54; 55] model an image data as functional measurements and apply the regularization penalty to induce zero-effect for the region where there is no association between responses and images. Here the authors used pre-specified Haar wavelet basis functions to approximate coefficient functions for which the selection of the optimum number of basis is based on either information criterion or crossvalidation, which is a time-consuming step for multi-dimensional images. Such methodologies are also not directly applicable in the presence of noisy image data. Furthermore, the authors adopted a permutation-based test to make inference about the non-zero effect in a region, and it is unclear how to test the nullity of the overall regression coefficient.",

The first novelty is the use of the functional data analysis approach exploiting the underlying covariance structure of 2-dimensional (2D) X-ray data, which has not previously been used, to the best of our knowledge, in this generality in image classification. The second novelty is the parsimonious modeling of the coefficient function using data-driven basis functions. The third novelty is casting the scalar-on-image regression model into a generalized linear model framework, which allows hypothesis testing about the parameters of interests explaining the association between responses and covariates. The main advantages of this approach are as below -(1) It provides excellent numerical performance in terms of classification accuracy; (2) it is computationally efficient and magnitude faster; (3) unlike the deep learning approach, it does not require a massive set of images to train the model; (4) it offers inference about the effect of radiographic images in classification; (5) it is applicable for images corrupted with subtle noises.",

(M2) A random sample of 1,300 from each type (i.e., healthy and pneumonia) so that a total of 2,600 images form the whole dataset.

Notice (M2) ensures balanced cases and uses much smaller sample to train the model than that of (M1); the purpose is to assess the model's performance with a smaller sample. We consider two ways of forming the test set -(a) replicating the test-train split 200 times and evaluating the performance within each split (b) forming the test-train split for once. In both cases, test images are selected randomly without replacement. Approach (a) will potentially induce more randomness into the train-test split and is less susceptible to sampling bias.

Table 1 provides the numerical performance of the model for both in-sample and out-of-sample image data for (S1). The classification results are close in the validation set for both (a) and (b); due to the smaller training sample in (b), unsurprisingly, in-sample performances are marginally better. The high ACC values indicate that the model identifies pneumonia and healthy patients using X-rays correctly. The high F 1 values suggest a good balance between precision (i.e., TPR) and recall (i.e., PPV) referring to the number of instances that the model correctly classifies and instances that the model misses, respectively. Besides, the high AUC values (\u2265 0.98) indicate an excellent balance between TPR and the false positive rate (FPR). Apparently, we observe better classification performances in the Non-PEN method for (M1) than that of (M2). This could be due to the fact that (M1) is comprised of all images implying more variation in the data; therefore, an FPC analysis with a high PVE (i.e., 0.99) is likely to provide some directions associated with noise that could potentially overfit the model. Therefore, by shrinking such directions to zero, we improve the model performance. The IQR values provide evidence of small variation in the reported summary values across 200 validation sets for (a). The other important metrics such as TNR, PPV, and F 1 are reported in the Supplementary Material; see Section in 9. Table 2 provides the numerical performance of the model for (S2). Separating viral and bacterial cases using a scalar-on-image regression is a much more difficult problem than that of (S1). Overall, the model performs satisfactorily in differentiating between viral and bacterial pneumonia patients. As above, we observe better out-of-sample performances in PEN approach.",

As the calculated p-value is < 2.2e-16 for testing (1), we may conjecture that the observed patterns in the X-rays are distinctive between healthy individuals and pneumonia patients. Similarly, since the p-value for testing (2) is < 2.2e-16, we may conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the image data between viral and pneumonia patients. Further results related to testing the equality of mean scores between healthy and pneumonia patients are provided in Section of the Supplementary Material 9.

Classification metrics are presented for in-sample and out-of-sample data with respect to training-testing schemes (a) and (b) based on (M1) and (M2). Median and corresponding IQR (in parenthesis) across 200 iterations are reported for scheme (a). In this section, we consider a simulation study generating X-ray images for healthy and pneumonia patients. The objective is to assess the model performance when the images are alterted by noises. Let the observed data be y i * , {X i * (h u , w v ); u = 1, . . . , U, v = 1, . . . , V }; i * = 1, . . . , N * ; where y i * is the binary response associated with the i * th subject for who the simulated image, X i * (\u22c5, \u22c5)., is rendered. Let N * = 600. We generate gray-scaled 120 \u00d7 80 pixel images for each patient such that U = 120 and V = 80. Denote by X i * (h u , w v ) = X i (h u , w v ) + \u03b5 uv the model that generates noisy realizations of X-ray images; where \u03b5 uv is a white noise which follows IID N (0, \u03c3 2 ). Here X i (\u22c5, \u22c5)'s are the original gray-scaled images selected randomly from 5,216 original images; i.e. i \u2208 N h or i \u2208 N p . Note that the standard deviation \u03c3 controls the departure in pixel from the true X-ray images; as \u03c3 departs from zero, the image quality drops gradually and gets perturbed on both u and v directions. In our simulation study, we consider \u03c3 \u2208 {1e-8, 0.01, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, 1.00}; see Figure 2 . Note that as the magnitude of noise increases, it gets difficult to interpret and becomes indistinguishable between healthy and pneumonia cases. For each setting, we run simulations for 500 times, and within each run, we simulate the X-ray images for 300 healthy and 300 pneumonia patients. We label the binary responses such that y i * = 0 if a patient belongs to the healthy cohort and 1, otherwise. To assess the classification performance of the proposed method, we divide each simulated dataset into training (75%) and test set (25%) and calculate the classification metrics for both in-sample and out-of-sample data.",

The results are close for \u03c3 = 0.01 and \u03c3 = 0.10, which provides evidence of the efficacy of the proposed methodology in the presence of noise. Overall, both PEN and Non-PEN perform competitively. While the model still classifies patients satisfactorily for \u03c3 \u2265 0.50, the performance drops to an extent. This phenomenon is not too unexpected as it becomes hard for the model to extract the signal out of the data from such noisy images. In reality, such low-quality images are not even recommended for clinical use anyway. Additional results are provided in Section of the Supplementary Material 9. Figure 3 illustrates the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operator characteristic for different noise levels for the Non-PEN (left) and PEN (right) model; the differences are very marginal and visually indistinguishable.

We approximate both functional covariate and coefficient using the same orthonormal data-driven basis functions and cast the model into a GLM framework. The methodology relies on the assumption that the leading eigenbasis functions of the functional predictor are most predictive of generalized response and that the latent predictor signals are relatively smooth. The proposed idea is applicable to other response types that follow multinomial, Poisson, Gaussian, or any other distribution belonging to the Exponential family; in this case, we need to select the corresponding link function appropriately (e.g., log link for Poisson). The methodology can be extended to the case with multiple functional predictors observed with or without noise and defined on diverse sampling designs. Numerical results using chest X-rays show excellent classification performances in detecting (a) pneumonia and healthy patients, (b) viral and bacterial pneumonia cases. The method performs competitively even when we have a smaller sample to train the model. Two numerical experiments based on the data application show the robustness of the methodology and exhibit efficacy in attaining the inferential properties in terms of size and power. Despite the increased flexibility, the method is computationally efficient (computation time is in seconds) and can be implemented with the existing freely available software.",

Also, the detection of COVID-19 patients becomes a significant challenge due to the limited detection kits and short of medical supplies. The current testing approach is based on PCR, which is a time-consuming procedure. Besides, the community hospitals in remote areas are falling short in medical supplies and staff. Therefore, an alternative testing procedure based on radiography examination may play a role in identifying COVID patients as a supplement to the existing process. In a recent study, the chest radiography images of COVID-19 patients indicate abnormalities in their X-rays, suggesting the effectiveness of a radiography examination as an alternative infection detection approach; see [21; 36; 1] . We want to address that COVID detection is more complicated due to the presence of pre-existing conditions and uncertainty about disease-biology as we are still in an early stage of this outbreak, and thus requires substantial validation and very high-quality data.",

We apply functional principal component (FPC) analysis on the marginal covariance function \u0393(w, w \u2032 ) induced by the functional predictor comprised of intensity profiles associated with 5,216 X-ray images. Setting a percentage of variance explained (PVE) value equal to 99% provides directions at which we have maximum variation in the data. We estimate functional principal components\u03c6 k (\u22c5) and corresponding eigenvalues\u03bb k ; where k = 1, \u22ef, 19. Figure 6 displays the estimated directions with the explained percentage of variance; first, 6 FPCs explain almost 96% variation in the data. Similarly, spectral decomposition on G k (h, h \u2032 ) for each k, results in\u03c8 kl (\u22c5)'s and\u03b7 kl 's. Figure 7 displays the estimated directions associated with the profile of loadings\u03be w,i1 (\u22c5); first, 6 FPCs explain approximately 96% variation in the data. Similarly, we do it for each k. In our example, L 1 + \u22ef + L 19 = 187. Figure 8 displays the boxplots of the estimated scores (first 60 components) corresponding to both normal and pneumonia patients' intensity profiles. Figure 9 displays the log p-values for testing the equality of mean scores between healthy and pneumonia patients at 5% level of significance. In particular, we test H 0 \u2236\u03b6 0 kl =\u03b6 1 kl for each k and l; where\u03b6 0 kl and\u03b6 1 kl refer to the mean values associated with the klth component for normal and pneumonia patients, respectively. A two-tailed t-test statistic is used to make inference. For testing, H 0 \u2236\u03b6 0 k =\u03b6 1 k , for each k, we adjust for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction.",

We observe high TNRs implying low false-positive rates (FPRs), and high PPVs indicating low false discovery rates (FDR). Such observations are dominant across all settings. As before, PEN outperforms Non-PEN in the setting (M1), and the magnitude of improvement is higher in evaluating out-of-sample cases than that of in-sample ones. These findings are in alignment with what we observe in Table 1 of the draft. Table 6 provides additional results for (S1). The results between PEN and Non-PEN are competitive. Table 7 displays additional binary classification results for the simulated data with different magnitude of noises. We notice similar phenomena as in Table 3 of the draft; the classification Table 5 : Comparison of chest X-rays between pneumonia and normal (S1).
