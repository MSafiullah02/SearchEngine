All ages are susceptible to infection, and viral shedding may occur in asymptomatic individuals. 7 The risk factors for poor prognosis include advancing age and comorbidities 8 , while mortality is associated with age, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer levels of >1 \u03bcg/mL on admission 9 .",

Its counterparts include 4 strains of low pathogenicity (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), as well as 2 other \u03b2-coronaviruses which caused the previous outbreaks of severe and potentially fatal respiratory tract infections -SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 10 SARS-CoV-2 more closely resembles SARS-CoV (79% sequence identity) than MERS-CoV (50% sequence identity). 11 It also shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. 12 ACE2 receptors are enriched in alveolar epithelial type II cells of lung tissues 13 , as well as extrapulmonary tissues such as the heart, endothelium, kidneys and intestines 14, 15 , which might play a role in the multi-organ effects of COVID-19.",

Unfortunately, there are no specific clinical features that discern COVID-19 from other viral respiratory illnesses. 29 Although most patients will only experience mild symptoms of the disease, some patients will experience rapid progression of their symptoms over the span of a week (Table 3) . 3, 25 One study 30 found that 17% of their patients developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and among these, 65% rapidly worsened and died from multiple organ failure. In a study focusing on the associated risk factors 31 , it was reported that ARDS was greatly associated with older age (>65 years old), Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and hypertension. For most cases, bilateral lower zone consolidation (identified through chest x-ray) peaked at 10-12 days from symptom onset. 32 Radiological manifestations COVID-19 infection shares similar radiological features 33 to those of other viral pneumonia. 34 The hallmarks of COVID-19 on Computed Topography (CT) imaging were bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs), and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Crazy paving patterns have also been observed. 27 A staging system for using CT images has been reported 33 and is summarized in Table 4 .",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, shock, and multi-organ failure precipitate death. Full attention to the comorbidities and potential organ injuries is therefore crucial in the implementation of preventative and protective measures. Acknowledging this could help in triaging the management of individual patients, minimizing the risk of decompensation. Alongside the rapid pace at which scientific results are shared, this paper hopes to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID-19. Estimated hazard ratio indicates that the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients with AKI is ~5.3x (p < 0.001) higher than the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients without AKI. Conclusions: BUN and SCr are key predictors of AKI and they were found to be significantly higher in non-severe cases of COVID-19 compared to other commonly known pneumonia. Both high levels of BUN and SCr were commonly observed in severe and deceased cases across the course of COVID-19. Unlike BUN, for other pneumonia cases, there were no reported elevated SCr levels. Occurrence of kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 patients could be due to kidney-lung crosstalk 76 for the following reasons: renal cells have the potential to be target sites for SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory responses following lung impairments could damage the kidney, where this kidney-lung crosstalk could lead to a \"cytokine storm\" that acutely induces multi-organ failure and death. Furthermore, direct renal cellular damage is consistent with another report 77 which found acute renal tubular damage in 6 COVID-19 cases from the histological analysis of renal cell autopsies.",

The search terms were used as key word and in combination as MeSH terms to maximize the output from literature findings. A staged literature search was done, whereby a separate literature search was performed for each section within this article and all the relevant studies were identified and summarized separately.

These pathological features lead to the further aggravation of alveolar and interstitial oedema.
