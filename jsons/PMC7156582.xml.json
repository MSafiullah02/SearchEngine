A learning management system is a software application for maintaining, delivering, and tracking educational resources.13 To fulfil the global, open access aims of Heart University, the team selected the eFront learning management system, created by DHx Software, LLC. This system comprehensively met the outlined needs, with the necessity of secure user login protocols, easy-to-navigate and visually appealing user interface, and detailed background analytics and learning assessment (Fig 2). The detailed design of the Heart University learning management system began in November 2017, with initial focus on developing the newly conceived Pediatric Cardiac Learning Center and transitioning the existing ACHD Learning Center over to the new learning management system.",

Several members of the Editorial Boards of Heart University have been appointed to the Editorial Board of Cardiology in the Young, including Justin T. Tretter,Rohit S. Loomba, and Andrew N. Redington. These common members of the Editorial Boards will assure ongoing alignment of the missions of Heart University and Cardiology in the Young. Another area of collaboration is that Heart University will begin to feature White Papers, Guideline Papers, and Landmark Papers published in Cardiology in the Young.18,22,23 Approximately every 4 months, Cardiology in the Young will provide Heart University with a new \u201chot of the press\u201d major paper that is published in Cardiology in the Young. Heart University will post and highlight this paper on the Heart University site. A discussion board surrounding the paper will be established and the lead author of the manuscript will be invited to moderate the discussion. Finally, bidirectional hyperlinks will be established between the websites of Heart University and Cardiology in the Young. The leadership of Heart University and Cardiology in the Young are currently actively exploring additional opportunities for collaboration.",

A clear limitation to providing a large amount of material readily available online with no structured plan for navigating through the material and assessing mastery of the content is that the user may become complacent, with little motivation to work comprehensively through the outlined curriculums. The end result is a broad superficial familiarity with a topic without a mastery of its fundamental concepts. We are working to build in some rigour into the process of online learning through certification courses that mandate answering questions relating to the topic material (i.e., Certification in Cardiac Anatomy). The site eventually aims to provide continued medical education credit for practising providers, navigating the various specific international requirements. We additionally are actively pursuing a means to provide objective credit and applicable analytical feedback for content creators of learning modules that will be pertinent for career advancement. While our focus is to continue to improve upon and fill the gaps of the current three component sites, we have also been in discussion with other international organisations wishing to create component sites specific to their specialties, e.g., congenital cardiac surgery and cardiac anaesthesia.",
