This phenomenon is very common in many fields, and has been previously explored by different approaches in epidemiology, social and biomedical research among many other contexts [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The sources and underlying mechanisms that cause the underreporting might differ depending on the particular data. Some authors consider a situation where the registry is updated with time and therefore the underreporting issue is mitigated 6 . That leads to temporary underreporting while this work is focused on permanent underreporting, where the registered data are never updated in order to become more accurate. From the methodological point of view, several alternatives have been explored, from Markov chain Monte-Carlo based methods 5 to recent discrete time series approaches 7, 8 and several attempts to estimate the degree of underreporting in several contexts have been done 9 , although there is a lack of models incorporating continuous time series structures and handling underreporting.",

Generally, the infection disappears on its own without inducing any health problem, but in some cases it can produce an abnormal growth of cells on the surface of the cervix that could potentially lead to cervical cancer. HPV infection is also related to several cancers (cervical, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, . . . ) and other diseases like genital warts (GW). The fact that most cases of HPV infection are asymptomatic causes that public health registries might be potentially underestimating its incidence.

For each autocorrelation structure and parameters combination, a random sample of size n = 1000 has been generated using the function arima.sim from R package forecast 19, 20 . Different sample sizes (n = 50, 100, 500) have also been analysed to study the impact of sample size on accuracy and the results are reported in the Supplementary Material. The complete tables with the estimates corresponding to each combination of parameters can be found in Table S4 to S6 n = 50 and AR(1), M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) respectively, Tables S7 to S9 for n = 100 and Tables S10 to S12 for n = 500, and the performance is summarised in Tables S13 to S15 for n = 50, 100 and 500 respectively. Absolute average bias is similar regardless of the sample size, while average interval lengths (AIL) are higher and interval coverages are poorer (around 75% for n = 50) for lower sample sizes as could be expected. Several bootstrap sizes (b = 20, 50, 100) were also considered and the difference between them were negligible, so only results corresponding to b = 100 bootstrap replicates are reported. The average absolute bias, interval coverage and 95% confidence interval length are reported in Table 1 . These values are averaged over all combinations of parameters. Additionally, standard AR(1), M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) models were fitted to the same simulated series without accounting for their underreporting structure. The complete table with the estimates corresponding to each combination of parameters is available as Supplementary Material (Tables S1, S2 and S3 for AR(1), M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) structures respectively).",

It is clear from Figure 1 that the estimated regression line does not cross the origin, so the behavior of the observed process is consistent with an underlying underreported AR(1) process. By means of the estimation method described in Section Estimation, it can be seen that the estimated model for the hidden process is X t = 0.104 \u00b7 X t\u22121 + \u01eb t , being the observed process Y t , Y t = X t with probability 0.202 0.236 \u00b7 X t with probability 0.798 (5) The estimated parameters are reported in Table 2 . These results are highly consistent with those previously reported in the literature for the number of HPV cases obtained through a discrete time series approach 7 and can be interpreted in a very straightforward way.
