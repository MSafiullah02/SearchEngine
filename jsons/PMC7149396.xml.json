The K1 antibody was shown to recognize dsRNA; therefore, we hypothesized that the CoV epitope was dsRNA. To determine whether this phenotype is present in a stable cell line, we infected IFN-responsive AML12 hepatocytes with wild-type or EndoUmut MHV and measured accumulation of replication complexes (anti-nsp2/3) and dsRNA foci (anti-dsRNA, K1) at 8 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1A). In AML12 cells, wild-type and EndoUmut virus have similar replication kinetics and viral RNA expression, but EndoUmut elicited enhanced type I and type III IFN expression during infection (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). We quantified the number of nsp2/3 foci and dsRNA foci from 50 individual cells. We found that, while the numbers of nsp2/3-labeled replication complexes were not significantly different (Fig. 1B, Right), the total number of dsRNA foci per cell was elevated in EndoUmut-infected cells (Fig. 1B, Left). Median fluorescent intensity of the individual dsRNA foci was also brighter in EndoUmut-infected cells (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that EndoUmut infection results in increased abundance of an epitope recognized by the K1 anti-dsRNA antibody.",

To this end, we sequenced the RNA precipitated with the K1 anti-dsRNA antibody. We obtained \u223c30 million reads for each total RNA sample and \u223c10 million reads for immunoprecipitated samples. Upon mapping the reads to the mouse genome, we found similar read counts to host genes from both wild-type\u2212 and EndoUmut-infected cells (data available at NCBI GEO database, accession no. GSE144886) (33). We then mapped the reads to the MHV-A59 genome (GenBank accession no. AY910861) (34), and separated the viral reads by strand specificity, expecting to identify complementary sequences from positive- and negative-sense RNA. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of reads from the immunoprecipitated RNA sample mapped to negative-sense RNA (Fig. 2A). We discovered that 99.8% of the reads from the input RNA sample mapped to positive-sense RNA. In contrast, 99.8% of the reads from the immunoprecipitated RNA mapped to negative-sense RNA. We found that the reads from the input RNA sample mapped across the entire MHV genome, as expected (Fig. 2 B and D). Similarly, the reads from the immunoprecipitated RNA sample also mapped across the entire genome (Fig. 2 C and E). We concluded that the K1 antibody immunoprecipitated full-length, negative-sense RNAs. When comparing the read counts between wild-type virus- and EndoUmut virus-infected samples, we found an eightfold increase (6 \u00d7 105 read counts versus 4 \u00d7 106 read counts) in the abundance of the reads from the EndoUmut virus-infected samples (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the increase in dsRNA foci observed in EndoUmut-infected cells by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1).",

We used random hexamers as primers for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, which allows for generation of cDNA from both positive- and negative-sense RNA, and then evaluated the abundance of cDNA by qPCR. We consistently detected elevated levels of viral RNA immunoprecipitated by the dsRNA antibody from EndoUmut virus-infected cells as compared to the levels detected in wild-type virus-infected cells (Fig. 3A). The total input viral RNA was similar between wild-type\u2212 and EndoUmut-infected cells (Fig. 3B). Overall, our sequencing and qPCR results suggest that EndoU reduces the accumulation of a negative-sense viral RNA epitope that can be recognized by the anti-dsRNA antibody.",

Therefore, we considered the PUN RNA as a potential target for EndoU activity. We hypothesized that PUN RNAs accumulate in the absence of EndoU activity. To quantitate the PUN RNAs, we generated cDNA from the negative-sense RNA using a strand-specific primer and performed a series of qPCRs with primers shown in Fig. 4A. Primer set 1 flanks a taqman probe and provides a measurement of total negative-sense RNA. Primer set 2 measures the PUN RNA. By normalizing set 2 to set 1, we can compare relative proportions of the negative-sense RNA that contain polyU sequences. To control for potential \u201cself-priming\u201d of the viral RNA during cDNA synthesis, we performed cDNA synthesis in the presence or absence of the negative-sense cDNA primer and quantified RNA expression by qPCR (Fig. 4B). For both set 1 and set 2 qPCRs, we detected a significantly higher signal with the negative-sense primer compared to no primer. When comparing wild-type\u2212 and EndoUmut-infected cells, we detected a 10-fold increase in PUN RNAs from EndoUmut-infected cells as compared to wild-type virus-infected AML12 cells (Fig. 4C, Left) and detected a 60-fold increase in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Fig. 4D, Left). To determine whether the polyA tail on the positive-sense RNA was similarly reduced by EndoU activity, we used either random hexamers or oligo-dT primers for reverse transcription and determined that the abundance of polyA tails on positive-sense RNA does not differ between wild-type and EndoUmut infections (Fig. 4 C and D, Middle and Right). We concluded that EndoU activity reduces the abundance of negative-sense RNA that contains polyU extensions.",

We detected PCR species of \u223c100 bp from both wild-type\u2212 and EndoUmut-infected cells, and detected a smear of larger PCR species unique to EndoUmut virus-infected cells (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the length of polyA tails on the positive-sense RNA was affected by EndoU activity, we generated cDNA with oligo-dT primers to select for polyA-containing RNAs and performed the nested PCR reactions. We found that the products generated from positive-sense RNA were similar between wild-type and EndoUmut viruses, consistent with our previous results indicating that the polyA tail is not cleaved by EndoU activity (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the smear of PCR amplicons represents extended polyU sequences, we sequenced the amplicons with next-generation sequencing and found that EndoUmut PCR amplicons had an increase in the number of reads and proportion of products with extended polyU sequences (Fig. 5D). The most striking feature of the sequencing results is the bimodal distribution of the polyU extensions present in the EndoUmut-infected cell samples. We found that the majority (65%) of the reads from wild-type virus infection contained 10 uridine residues. In contrast, only 35% of the reads from the EndoUmut virus-infected sample contained 10 uridine residues. This was not due to a difference in the number of reads with 10 uridines but to an increase in longer polyU extensions detected in EndoUmut-infected cells. We detected variability in the polyU extensions in the EndoUmut virus-infected sample, with 65% of the reads containing from 11 to 17 uridine residues. We note that, while PUN RNAs in EndoUmut-infected cells are only a few uridines longer than the PUN RNAs from wild-type virus-infected cells, the PUN RNAs are 10-fold more abundant in EndoUmut virus-infected cells (Fig. 4). Overall, these experiments revealed that EndoU activity reduces the abundance and length of polyU extensions on PUN RNAs, consistent with our hypothesis that EndoU cleaves the PUN RNAs during virus replication.",

Although the EndoU domains of MHV and PEDV exhibit only about 50% overall amino acid similarity, the catalytic histidines are 100% conserved (19). We showed that inactivation of EndoU in PEDV results in an increased type I and type III IFN response during infection (20). To determine whether EndoU limits the accumulation of PUN RNAs during PEDV infection, we infected cells with either wild-type or EndoUmut PEDV, isolated RNA, and evaluated the levels of PUN RNAs. We found that, relative to wild-type virus-infected cells, EndoUmut virus-infected cells contained abundant PUN RNAs in PK1 (Fig. 6A) and Vero cells (Fig. 6B). Sequences of PCR products templated by PUN RNA revealed that the length of the polyU extensions on the PUN RNAs was increased during EndoUmut virus infection (Fig. 6 C and E), with a similar bimodal distribution of polyU extensions shown in Fig. 5D. During PEDV infection, we did not observe a difference in polyA tail length (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results indicate that PUN RNAs are generated during alpha- and beta-CoV replication, and that the highly conserved EndoU activity targets the polyU extensions in the PUN RNA.",

RNA 4 was not cleaved, consistent with the requirement of uridine residues for EndoU recognition and cleavage. To determine whether EndoU cleavage can decrease the ability of PUN RNA to stimulate IFN, we cleaved the PUN RNA with EndoU (Fig. 8D). In the presence of EndoU and MnCl2, the PUN RNA was degraded into smaller RNA fragments. After EndoU treatment, we transfected the PUN RNAs into AML12 cells and measured IFN stimulation (Fig. 8E).

We note that the PUN RNA with MnCl2 migrated faster in the agarose gel, likely due to the addition of the Mn2+ cation (36), but we do not observe a difference in IFN stimulation in the presence of MnCl2 alone.

Our immunofluorescence studies showed that the epitope recognized by K1 accumulates in EndoUmut-infected cells. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we determined that the RNA bound by K1 was negative-sense RNA. We speculate that CoV negative-sense RNA forms a higher-order RNA structure recognized by the K1 antibody, and that this RNA is also recognized by host sensors. Supporting this idea, a previous study showed that the viral RNA recognized by the K1 antibody during encephalomyocarditis virus infection formed a higher-order RNA structure and could activate MDA5 (39). Our approach using RNA-seq analysis of immunoprecipitated RNA could be widely used to determine whether other unique dsRNA epitopes are generated during viral infections. Sch\u00f6nborn et al. developed four anti-dsRNA antibodies: J2, J5, K1, and K2 (38). These antibodies were generated against the L species of dsRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and each antibody has unique binding specificities to different dsRNA species. For example, the K1 antibody was reported to be highly specific to poly I:C, whereas the J2 antibody is specific to the L species of dsRNA (38, 40). The differing specificities suggest that each anti-dsRNA antibody recognizes unique dsRNA structures or sequences. Ultimately, structural studies are needed to fully elucidate the higher-order RNA structures that these dsRNA antibodies are recognizing during CoV infection.",

Previous studies implicated MDA5 as the PRR important for macrophages to respond to CoV infection (6, 18). Consistent with these studies, we report that the PUN RNA acts as a PAMP, recognized by MDA5 (Fig. 7). We show that knocking down MDA5 by CRISPR-Cas9 limits the IFN stimulation by PUN RNA. Canonically, MDA5 binds to long dsRNA species, such as poly I:C, to induce IFN signaling (4). Our study suggests that the negative-sense RNA may form a higher-order RNA structure that can bind and activate MDA5. Interestingly, a longer polyU extension (>12 uridines) on the RNA drives a heightened IFN response. Currently, many studies utilize nucleic acid as an adjuvant to stimulate innate immune responses (41). With the PUN RNA forming an MDA5-recognized structure, it would be interesting to determine whether the PUN RNA could act as an MDA5 adjuvant to elicit robust IFN responses during immunizations.",

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome encodes a long polyU stretch on the positive-sense RNA, but the polyU region is flanked by highly structured RNA, which may limit immune stimulation (42). Furthermore, the HCV replication complexes may hide the viral RNA from recognition by host sensors (43). Polioviruses prime replication of the negative-sense RNA with a polyU sequence attached to VPg (44). The VPg linkage may prevent the exposure of a polyU structure to host sensors, thus preventing the polyU sequence from acting as a PAMP. For influenza viruses, the polyU sequence on negative-sense RNA is essential for polyadenylation, because it is part of a unique stem\u2212loop structure (45). However, this RNA structure is localized to the nucleus and not exposed to cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors. These examples illustrate that many viruses have polyU sequences that may act as PAMPs, and that each virus may have evolved unique mechanisms or structures that limit their detection.",

            "text": "Our study also raises interesting questions about how the CoV polyA tail is generated during positive-sense RNA synthesis. Studies from influenza virus revealed that a short polyU sequence within a unique RNA stem\u2212loop mediates a stuttering mechanism used to polyadenylate the positive-sense RNA (45). In contrast, Peng et al. (46) implicate that CoVs utilize a noncanonical cytoplasmic polyadenylation site to synthesize the positive-sense polyA tail. They identified a conserved viral sequence on the positive-sense RNA that could be bound by host proteins, including cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1) (47), a protein that mediates polyadenylation. In addition, CoV nsp8 has been demonstrated to contain 3\u2032 terminal adenylyltransferase (TAT) activity (48). Nsp8 can synthesize the polyA tail on the positive-sense RNA, and having a complement negative-sense RNA with a polyU extension greater than five uridines enhances the TAT activity. Since we observe EndoU controlling the abundance of longer polyU sequences which stimulate IFN, it would be interesting to determine whether there is an \u201cideal length\u201d of polyU sequences that lack immune stimulation by MDA5, but promote TAT activity during addition of the polyA tail. One caveat of these in vitro studies is that the assays are performed in the absence of other viral replication complex proteins that may alter the binding, recognition, and activity of the RNA processing proteins. Studies have shown protein\u2212protein interactions between nsp12, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp15, which may alter the activities of these proteins (31, 49). While EndoU can fully degrade PUN RNAs in vitro, the cleavage activity may be more specific during viral infection, due to interactions with other viral proteins in the membrane-associated replicase complex (50, 51). While EndoU can cleave PUN RNA, there may also be other EndoU cleavage sites during CoV infection that were not detected in this study. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms CoVs use to alter and process viral RNAs.",

One vaccine strategy is to generate attenuated viruses that can efficiently be produced and signal for robust, protective, antiviral immune responses. EndoU is not necessary for viral replication, and EndoUmut CoVs are attenuated in vivo while still eliciting a protective immune response (11, 20). Therefore, EndoU may be one of several immune antagonists targeted for generating an attenuated and recombination-resistant CoV vaccine (58, 59). Ideally the IFN antagonist mutations would be conserved so they can be applied to any current or emergent CoV, including the 2019-nCoV. In addition, the enzymatic activity of EndoU could be targeted for the development of an antiviral therapeutic.",
