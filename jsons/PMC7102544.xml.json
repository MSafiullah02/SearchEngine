Each Hajj draws over 2.5 million attendees and, in some years, almost 3 million \u2018Guests of God\u201d as the KSA regards them. Safeguarding the lives of millions of pilgrims is the cardinal duty and honor of the Custodian of the Two Holy Cities in Islam. Keeping Hajj safe and sacrosanct are the overriding national priorities of the KSA and the ruling monarch. Protecting the lives of pilgrims during Hajj however is not only a matter of governing national policy for the KSA and its monarch, but a divinely ordained duty. The stakes for protecting Hajj are therefore extremely high, not only in scale but also in terms of the religious mandate.",

We predict Hajj 2020 may be suspended in the interests of global safety as well as a precaution for domestic containment in the KSA [5]. While almost unprecedented-the last time Hajj was canceled predates the formation of the modern KSA, Islam mandates that the sanctity of human life be placed above all other rights including the right of God to demand worship by mankind. With this in mind, the KSA in canceling Hajj 2020 well in advance of the events would be very much in line with Islamic ideals and would contribute greatly to the safety of humanity in doing so [6]. We also predict that Hajj planners and the Saudi authorities will very much set the tone for the international community in addressing many forthcoming mass gatherings including the forthcoming Olympics in Japan (see Fig. 1\n).",

The public must be informed to wash hands with soap and water frequently, as well as before and after visits to the lavatory and before and after eating. The public must learn to wash their hands for at least - 20 s - and when hands are not overtly soiled, to use an alcohol hand rub. While alcohol is forbidden for ingestion to the observing Muslim, it is permitted for all medical purposes including as both a vehicle for medications and in topical form as alcohol hand hygiene agents. The KSA has been very far sighted in issuing religious fatwahs for such medical practices for over two decades with KSA's scholars issuing fatwas to reassure Muslim patients and the wider public of the acceptability of the use of alcohol hand rub for the Muslim without violating any principles of Islam [15]. In this time of COVID-19 outbreaks, religious authorities would do well to remind the Muslim public of the legitimacy of alcohol hand rubs as safe and indeed preferred mode of hand hygiene and coronavirus containment.",

The enormous effort of this temporary but massive and sophisticated healthcare system that KSA engages and operates for the purposes of the religious pilgrim visiting in Hajj season means that many thousands of HCWs must travel to the Hajj sites as well. Sometimes they are hired from outside the country, many international volunteer doctors and other personnel seek to serve the \u2018guests of god\u2019. These workers are also at risk should Hajj be allowed to continue in the face of an accelerating COVID-19 outbreak. The impact would be two-fold. Not only of more health care personnel exposed to active disease with the threat of severe infection in localized pockets and then transmission to others seeking medical care, but also a twofold burden on the HCWs-caring for patients afflicted by the outbreak or compromised by it somehow and managing fellow colleagues sickened by the intensification of exposure. The semi-permanent health services at Hajj are already siphoning off critical healthcare staff from their usual responsibilities throughout the KSA managing a population of close to 32 million including 10 million expatriates. In a scenario with colleagues falling ill and on some occasions dying, the wider Saudi healthcare system could be singularly more impacted by the COVID-19 crisis during Hajj than any other healthcare workforce yet to date.

Thus, a greater impact on China translates as more significant reverberations in the global markets. SARS reduced China's GDP by 1% in 2003- then 100 Billion Renmibi at a time when China represented only 4% of the global GDP. Today the losses are already far greater.",

While that decision will be heartbreaking for individual Muslims and both spiritually and economically damaging for the Kingdom, solace will be obtained in knowing the Muslim majority world can contribute to the wellbeing of humanity. Further, the Kingdom has the opportunity to lead the world in acknowledging that even the most beloved and long-awaited mass gathering events including the Olympics must sometimes be suspended, postponed or canceled. Hajj planners frequently consult on the management of mass gatherings including the US inauguration, the Olympics and the World Cup. Their preemptive management of the coronavirus crisis in the setting of the world's largest and most diverse mass gathering is being closely followed and will be a blueprint for other mass gatherings soon following.",
