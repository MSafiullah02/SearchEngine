The 2002\u20132003 SARS coronavirus pandemic vividly demonstrated that prompt reporting and effective communication powerfully impact the course of an outbreak, and that local delays may escalate into national and global emergencies. Political will played a fundamental role in the global eradication of smallpox, which was announced by an independent committee of experts in December 1979 and ratified by the World Health Organization in 1980, after almost two centuries of challenges (Figure 1) 17, 18. Only a few decades later, the poliovirus vaccination campaign provided a crucial lesson, when it revealed that stopping vaccination initiatives, even temporarily, may translate into local setbacks and, subsequently, global emergencies, such as the re\u2010emergence of the virus in previously disease\u2010free areas, compromising and delaying global eradication efforts. The increased infectious disease morbidity and mortality in areas of conflict, which are characterised by reduced access to medication and vaccines, is an additional international and global concern that slowed past eradication efforts and promises challenges for the future.",

One of the key lessons that emerged in the wake of the SARS pandemic was that social and political factors are powerfully shaping the outcome of the outbreak. As vividly reflected, an initial delay in reporting the initial SARS coronavirus infections in China exerted a major contribution on the global dynamics of the outbreak 22. In China, Guangdong officials first publicly reported about the disease on 11 February 2003, when provincial health officials informed about 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, and also indicated that the disease was under control. Nevertheless, the first case is thought to have started on 16 November 2002, and an investigation of the outbreak took place during this interval 23, 24. Even though rumours about the disease were circulating during this time, and even after it became known that the infection was highly contagious, it was reported that local authorities in Guangdong did not alert the neighbouring provinces and Hong Kong officials 23, 25, 26. When the media first reported about the outbreak in February 2003, it conveyed the information that the outbreak was under control 23. The outbreak was hardly mentioned in the media until 20 April 2003, when it was announced to the public 27. The number of reported infections skyrocketed overnight, from 37 to 346, when a military surgeon publicly accused health officials of covering up the true extent of the outbreak. Subsequently, the President of China warned against a cover\u2010up and requested an accurate report of the cases 23. Partially, this period of silence was explained by the \u2018political mindset towards negative news\u2019, and the 4\u2010month media silence was important in shaping the course of the outbreak 23.",

            "text": "In contrast, in Vietnam, the prompt reporting and immediate actions taken by the government ensured that the disease was eradicated by the end of April 2003. As a result, the outbreak was considered contained on 28 April 2003, and Vietnam became the first country to achieve successful containment of the infection in the first phase of the outbreak 28. The quick recognition of the outbreak and the effective control of transmission in nosocomial settings, along with efficient international cooperation, the sharing of accurate information, and proper advice provided by the Ministry of Health were instrumental for successfully controlling the outbreak in Vietnam 29. Some of the contributing factors involved prompt steps that prevented the transmission from hospitals back into the community and the implementation of stringent infection control measures 30. Situated at the intersection of public health, political leadership and economic development, the SARS outbreak in China demonstrated that delays in reporting and in acting can translate into public health consequences within the country as well as beyond its borders 31. Once the virus was identified, its entire genome was sequenced by mid\u2010April, allowing the first steps towards understanding its biology 20. In analysing SARS outbreak epidemic curves from several countries, it was reported that delaying control measures during the outbreak would have tripled the size of the outbreak, and would have increased its duration by 4 weeks, underscoring the importance of promptly implementing infection control measures 32. Collaborative public health networks and prompt communication were particularly critical during the SARS outbreak 33. A better understanding of the species barrier and cross\u2010species transmission, and increased surveillance in animal reservoirs and humans emerge as fundamental aspects of these initiatives, and assume important roles for multiple zoonotic outbreaks 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. Subsequently, during the 2013 H7N9 influenza outbreak, China has gained international recognition for its effective response in handling the outbreak 42. The lessons provided by SARS made important contributions towards strengthening our capabilities in at least three areas: outbreak alertness, public health responses and international health 21.",

To a large extent, this became possible through political will and determination. The smallpox eradication campaign was launched in the mid\u20101960s 45, and it represented one of the earliest examples when the medical community performed risk\u2010benefit calculations, shaping the progress of medicine 46. Several characteristics of the virus contributed to the possibility to effectively eradicate the infection. These included the severity of the infection, the absence of an intermediate host, the known mode of acquisition, the short incubation period of 7\u201317 days, the existence of only one serotype, the absence of silent, asymptomatic, or recurrent infections and of a human carrier state and the absence of treatments except for supportive measures 44, 47, 48, 49, 50. The high mortality rates and the absence of a cure were additional incentives to generate a vaccine as soon as possible 44. The need for approximately 200 million vaccine doses annually, and for stable freeze\u2010dried vaccines to ensure that individuals from remote tropical areas could be vaccinated, were some of the driving forces behind the technological developments associated with generating the smallpox vaccine 51. These also included the bifurcated needle, developed in 1966 and introduced into the vaccine program in late 1968, which used 0.0025 ml of vaccine per dose, one\u2010fourth of what was previously required, and allowed an untrained person to learn within an hour how to use it, and to subsequently vaccinate up to 1500 individuals within a day 51.",

Political will is credited as one of the contributors to this, as it facilitated populations in remote places, sometimes engaged in military conflict, to be vaccinated. This was particularly challenging in countries where governments and health officials changed frequently 55. To be successful, political will had to be sustained and to involve all levels of the community 15. To eradicate smallpox, one of the requirements was to ensure that it will be eradicated it in every country worldwide 54. Therefore, some countries that lacked the capacity to eradicate the disease depended on other countries for their success 53. To underline that a global infectious disease eradication campaign is contingent on the active participation of every country, including the countries with the weakest control programs, and the efforts of just one country can shape the benefits to all countries, eradication was referred to as a weakest\u2010link public good\n54, 56.",

During the immunisation campaigns, 150,000 healthcare workers were involved in reaching over 600,000 villages, walking from house to house to vaccinate people 44. In several states, cash rewards were offered to the first person giving information about a new case and to the health worker receiving the information, an initiative that motivated the reporting of new cases and contributed to health education in the community 44. Often, vaccinators were inoculating themselves in front of the entire community, to demonstrate that vaccination was not harmful 51. In India, the eradication campaign was particularly challenging in the southern part of the state of Bihar, inhabited by tribes and characterised by a poor governmental health organisation. In this state, an industrial town harbouring a large steel company was found to export many smallpox cases to the neighbouring states. A key role in supporting the campaign was played by the chairperson of a local industrial corporate, the Tata Group of Companies, by providing crucial economic and political support, in the form of healthcare personnel and managerial and communication assistance. As a result, the southern part of Bihar became smallpox\u2010free within a record time of 6 months 58, 59. Until 1950, it is estimated that over 100,000 people died in India annually as a result of smallpox 44. While in 1951 India had 52% of the smallpox cases in the world, this percentage decreased in 1975 to 7.5%, and the country was certified to be smallpox\u2010free on 23 April 1977 60.",

While prior to 1977, the smallpox eradication program in Somalia was reported to be plagued by concealment, in February 1977, after the government allowed the WHO to search for smallpox outside Mogadishu, transmission was detected, and after the WHO assumed a leading role in the surveillance and containment, smallpox was eradicated, and Somalia was declared smallpox\u2010free on 19 October 1979. It was reported that had the government been more open about the disease in Somalia 62, eradication would have happened sooner and at a lower cost. Smallpox eradication was particularly challenging in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, the third largest country in Africa, which was characterised by a particularly poor infrastructure and harboured 80% of the inhabitants residing in rural area and, at the time, had one of the most incomplete disease reporting systems in the world 63. In 1967, when the eradication program started, smallpox was widespread in the country, and the number of infections decreased to 3800 in 1968, with the last case being reported in 1971. The obstacles to vaccination in the DRC made it one of the more challenging countries during the smallpox eradication campaigns in Africa 63. This campaign provided important lessons for other infectious diseases, such as the need to increase vaccine coverage, enhance surveillance and establish collaborations within communities and across countries 63.",

Additional challenges emerged in 1974, when the military revolution that overthrew the Emperor marked the beginning of a very difficult period for the country, and while all UN operations had to cease, vaccinations were allowed to continue; from 25,000 cases in 1971, the number of infections decreased to 915 in 1976, and August of that year saw the last case 64.",

In some countries, such as Peru and El Salvador, vaccination efforts were so popular that guerillas not only observed cease\u2010fires but, in addition, often served as vaccinators 74. In El Salvador, between 1985 and 1992, during peace accords that were negotiated by the UNICEF, the Roman Catholic Church and several other organisations, fighting was suspended for 3 days annually to enable the vaccination of the children; as a result, the incidence of several infectious diseases decreased, and that of polio became zero 75.",

When some religious leaders in Northern Nigeria advised their followers not to allow their children to be vaccinated with the OPV, as a result of community pressure, federally sponsored polio immunisation campaigns came to a halt 77. One of the arguments was the belief that vaccines contained infertility drugs that were meant to sterilise young girls 77. As a result, between July 2003 and August 2004, five states in Northern Nigeria, Zamfara, Kaduna, Bauchi, Niger and Kano, initiated a boycott against polio vaccination 78, 79, 80. While vaccination campaigns resumed within a few months in the first four states, in Kano this only happened about a year later 80. The end result was the increase in the incidence of polio in Nigeria from 202 in 2002 to approximately 800 by the end of 2004 and to 1143 in 2006 80, 81. As a result of the suspended vaccination programs from Northern Nigeria, polio spread to 20 countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East 77, and led to 80% of the paralytic polio cases in the world 77, and DNA analyses of the virus confirmed that it originated in Nigeria 64. In Sudan, 105 cases of polio were confirmed in 17 of the 26 states as of 6 January 2005 82. The disease spread to other polio\u2010free countries, such as Indonesia, which had its last reported case in 1995, and where a case detected in April 2005 indicated that the infection has crossed the Indian Ocean 65. Ethiopia, another country where infections re\u2010occurred, had at the time been polio\u2010free for a year 65. In addition to the costs in human suffering based on the GPEI estimates, this boycott cost over $500 million in subsequent expenses to control the outbreak, and also ended the hopes to eradicate the disease globally during this decade 77, 81.",

In 2011, a measles epidemic accounted for 17% of the deaths among Somali refugees to a camp in Kenya 106. A threefold delay in diagnosing tuberculosis in conflict\u2010affected regions from the Somalia Regional State of Ethiopia was reported, in comparison to regions of the country not affected by conflict 105. During military conflict in Guinea\u2010Bissau, West Africa, patients with tuberculosis were over three times more likely to die because of irregularities in medical treatment as a result of the war, and each additional week of treatment before the war started led to a 5% increase in their probability to survive 107.",

The impact of military conflict on infectious disease outbreaks becomes even more relevant for the global community, if we consider that the profile of countries affected by conflict is shifting towards the ones with higher baseline incomes and higher life expectancies 108.",

            "text": "In the current era of global mobility and connectivity, when local infectious disease outbreaks can assume national and global dimensions within days or weeks, social and political factors occupy a central position in epidemic and pandemic preparedness. The global spread of infectious disease outbreaks, just like the success of global eradication programs, is shaped to a great extent by the sociopolitical framework from the country that is the least prepared. The integration of active surveillance, prompt detection and reporting, and information sharing between the animal and human health sectors, within and across countries, at the local, regional and global levels, assume central positions during outbreak preparedness efforts. Through their inherent nature, airborne infectious diseases are strategically more powerfully positioned than any other medical condition, at the intricate and labile confluence shaped by several disciplines. Most importantly, there is an urgent need to combine medical and biomedical initiatives with interventions from the social and political arena, to establish a transnational multi\u2010 and cross\u2010disciplinary framework. Capitalising on the teachings provided by previous epidemics and pandemics, this platform emerges as a fundamental facet of public health on the global stage that we all set through our interactions, and on which microbial choreography is unfolding faster and more dynamically than ever before.",
