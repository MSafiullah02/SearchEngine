Most infants admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory support during this infection are previously healthy, but their principal risk for needing PICU treatment is young age. That is, if you are born in October/November in the northern hemisphere, then your first winter exposure to RSV is likely to be when you are less than 4 months of age and vulnerable because of poor respiratory mechanical reserve (Alonso et al. 2007). However, if you are born in May/June, then you will be 7\u20138 months during your first winter exposure to RSV, much bigger and stronger and have more efficient thoracic and diaphragmatic mechanics. In the PICU, the main predictors of severe outcome in previously well infants appear to be young age, presence of apnea, and pulmonary consolidation on admission chest radiograph (Tasker et al. 2000; Lopez Guinea et al. 2007). Taken together, we can say that more severe RSV bronchiolitis in PICU practice is typically a problem of pulmonary consolidation, poor respiratory mechanics, and poor reserve, in the younger infant.",

RSV is the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis. Other viral causes include adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus. Cytomegalovirus can produce a bronchiolitis or pneumonitis-like illness in immunocompromised children. Rare, nonviral causes of bronchiolitis syndrome include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis infection. The pathology of RSV infection in the lower airways is characterized by sloughed necrotic epithelium, excessive mucus secretion, bronchial mucosal edema, and peribronchial inflammation.",

There are some infants where the respiratory features of RSV infection are silent at presentation but can become severe enough to require high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) (Arnold et al. 2000). There are others, where cardiac compromise is a consequence of cardiopulmonary interaction that improves with clinical improvement. For example, Sreeram et al. (1991) studied 21 infants with acute bronchiolitis, with normal hearts, and found that half had tricuspid valve regurgitation; many had evidence of raised pulmonary artery systolic pressure. In all such patients, myocardial injury may contribute to the severity of presentation (Checchia et al. 2000).",

            "text": "In regard to CO2 derangements in bronchiolitis, respiratory failure is defined as an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (P\naCO2) exceeding 65 mmHg (8.7 kPa). Reynolds (1963a) found that when such infants breathed air, there was little increase in P\naCO2 above 40 mmHg, even when respiratory rates were up to 60 breaths/min (Fig. 50.1). At a breathing rate of 60 breaths/min, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P\naO2) was ~60 mmHg (8 kPa). Downes et al. (1968) found two phases or a progression in CO2 clearance. In infants with P\naCO2 below 65 mmHg, the dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (V\nD/V\nT) was between 0.55 and 0.69. (In normal, spontaneously breathing infants, the ratio is 0.25 \u00b1 0.07, which is similar to that found in adults.) When increase in V\nD/V\nT originates within the respiratory system, it represents increase in V\nD, decrease in V\nT, or some combination of the two. Krieger and Whitten (1964) found lower mean V\nT and mean minute volume in 24 infants with acute bronchiolitis; they concluded, \u201crespirations may be considered shallow.\u201d Distinct from these causes, outside of the respiratory system, hypovolemia or shock may also lead to high V\nD/V\nT. Given this limit to lung physiology in bronchiolitis, avoidance of respiratory failure can be accomplished by maintenance of two- to threefold increase in minute volume (Downes et al. 1968). In bronchiolitis, if V\nT is limited, then compensatory increase in minute ventilation has to be due to an increase in respiratory frequency (Stokes et al. 1981). It is interesting to note that infants with respiratory failure (based on clinical and blood gas findings) have high V\nD/V\nT associated with minute ventilation close to predicted basal levels, which implies that the needed increase in minute ventilation has not been maintained. At this point, some infants are extremely tachypneic, so their deterioration represents worsening increase in V\nD or lessening of V\nT. In other infants, this state represents fatigue or an abnormality in lung mechanics that cannot be overcome. Of note, the V\nD/V\nT remains raised (0.46 \u00b1 0.10) even after starting MV, which is due to increase in physiologic dead space caused by hyperinflation or associated hypoperfusion (Almeida-Junior et al. 2007).\n\n",

Cyanosis is invariably present when SpO2 is below 85 %, but this is a late sign. There is a significant inverse relationship between respiratory rate and P\naO2 (Reynolds 1963a). In those breathing air, respiratory rate increases from 25 to 60 breaths/min as P\naO2 falls from 90 to 60 mmHg (Fig. 50.1). There is also a significant inverse linear correlation between P\naCO2 and P\naO2, which suggests that alveolar hypoventilation contributes to arterial hypoxemia (Downes et al. 1968). From first principles, in the Downes et al. data, the degree of hypoxemia is as expected from the alveolar gas equation and a normal alveolar-arterial oxygen (AaDO2) gradient: at a time when P\naCO2 is 65 mmHg (and assuming a respiratory quotient of 0.8), the expected alveolar PO2 is 68 mmHg, which is consistent with the P\naO2 of 50 mmHg observed. However, Reynolds (1963b) found much higher AaDO2 in 10 infants with bronchiolitis, ranging from 35 to 57 mmHg, and concluded that since administering oxygen (fractional inspired oxygen, FiO2, 0.4) made their P\naO2 rise to above 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa), the most likely cause of large AaDO2 gradient was ventilation-perfusion inequalities. As the condition becomes extremely severe, intrapulmonary shunt may become the more significant cause of high AaDO2 (Tasker et al. 2000).",

The critical questions are as follows: what is driving tachypnea, and what is causing V\nD/V\nT to increase? Rising P\naCO2 is not the stimulus for rapid breathing, since respiratory rate is increased despite near-normal levels.

Work of breathing in bronchiolitis is double to six times that of normal infants but similar to that of infants with bronchopneumonia (Krieger and Whitten 1964; Stokes et al. 1981). Interestingly, the latter do not present in extremis, which implies that this increase in work of breathing can be tolerated, but the problem may lie in whether lung mechanics in bronchiolitis permit such work. Since individual clinical features (e.g., auscultation, respiratory rate, and heart rate) do not correlate with total work of breathing, it is difficult to assess (Stokes et al. 1981). The degree of hyperinflation may be helpful in the assessment because it does mirror severity, but the best measure of work is esophageal pressure changes during breathing.",

This finding can be explained by the theory of \u201cequality of time constants,\u201d i.e., when flow is rapid in a system of unequally obstructed airways, the measured resistance will approximate that of the large peripheral pathways (Otis et al. 1950).",

This decrease in compliance is due, in part, to rapid respiratory rates (Helliesen 1958) and bronchiolar inflammation. The most significant factor, however, is the increased retractive force that is active at a high level of lung inflation; the degree of lung distention (i.e., V\nT) influences work expenditure more significantly when compliance is low. (Speed of distention, i.e., respiratory rate, is a more important influence when airflow resistance is increased.) Krieger and Whitten (1964) found that elastic work was less than expected in bronchiolitis. The rapid shallow mode of breathing, therefore, appears to be economical in terms of work expenditure when compliance is low (Otis et al. 1950), because elastic work is conserved through breathing fast. These points are illustrated in the two cases of bronchiolitis depicted in Fig. 50.2. The relationship between elastic (1/compliance), viscous (resistance), and total work of breathing per minute to frequency of breathing during bronchiolitis and on recovery is shown in graphs that have been calculated from first principles according to the equations described by Otis et al. (1950). The acute and convalescent data are from two cases of bronchiolitis reported by Krieger and Whitten (1964). The upper two panels (A and B) are from a 5.5 kg infant with, predominantly, reduced compliance. The lower two panels (C and D) are from a 4.5 kg infant with a mixed abnormality in compliance and resistance. The acute graphs (A and C) show a doubling of total work, due mainly to increased elastic work. The vertical lines show the infant\u2019s respiratory rate and where this rate intersects the work curves.\n\n",

In bronchiolitis, hyperinflation places the muscles of inspiration at a mechanical disadvantage; they are unable to shorten sufficiently to produce the necessary reduction in intrapleural pressure. Another physiologic problem that is considered to follow from obstructive breathing with large negative intrathoracic pressure swings (unbalanced by similar positive pressure efforts) is transpulmonary fluid shifts and the development of pulmonary edema (Stalcup and Mellins 1977). Stokes et al. (1981) did not find evidence for this phenomenon in 26 hyperinflated infants with bronchiolitis. Instead, the esophageal pressure monitoring in these infants showed positive values for a large portion of the respiratory cycle, which suggests that positive pressures were produced on expiration.

Ideally, these devices should deliver flow greater than the patient\u2019s peak inspiratory demand to fully support their minute ventilation. In addition, HFNC provides some level of CPAP, which depends on the flow delivered relative to the size of the patient and on the leak around the nasal cannulae. Flows of 3\u20135 L/min in term infants have been shown to generate intrapharyngeal pressure of up to 5 cm H2O (Spence et al. 2007). The advantages of this system over conventional nasal CPAP delivery devices are that it is less cumbersome, better tolerated, and as a consequence used earlier. The disadvantage of this system is that not all attendants may realize that HFNC is CPAP by another name \u2013 it isn\u2019t just nasal oxygen. As a consequence, clinical deterioration while receiving HFNC means failed low-level CPAP. McKiernan et al. (2010) reported their PICU experience of managing infants with RSV bronchiolitis before and after the introduction of HFNC to their practice. In the season after the introduction of HFNC, only 9 % of infants required intubation, compared with 23 % in the previous season (P = 0.04). HFNC decreased respiratory rate to a greater extent than other devices, and those with the greatest decrease in respiratory rate were least likely to be intubated. The authors also found that median PICU length of stay for cases of bronchiolitis decreased from 6 to 4 days.",

            "text": "A review of MV settings applied to infants with RSV \u2013 reported in the literature 1967\u20131994 \u2013 reveals considerable variation in practice (Table 50.2). Both volume-cycled and pressure-cycled MV are described in the literature with breathing rates varying from 10 to 60 breaths/min, maximum pressures from 20 to 50 cm H2O, and V\nT from 6 to 20 mL/kg (Leclerc et al. 2001). There is no evidence for a superior mode of MV, and it would be difficult to plan such a study since mortality and morbidity are low and, as noted above, time course on PICU is fairly consistent. We are therefore left with a pragmatic approach that takes account of the prevailing pathophysiology. Figures 50.3 and 50.4 illustrate this point. The inflation-deflation volume curves above FRC are hypothetical for a model 5 kg infant and based on data presented in the literature. (The curves are a simplification of the ideal situation with a number of assumptions \u2013 see figure legend \u2013 but they do illustrate the physiology). The \u201ccontrol\u201d cases in Fig. 50.3 represent the mean data for controls in the report by Hammer et al. (1997): if one chose to ventilate a 5 kg infant at a rate of 30 breaths/min with inflation pressure (P\ninf) of 16 cm H2O, we may expect P\naCO2 35 mmHg. The \u201cbronchiolitis\u201d cases in Fig. 50.3 represent the mean data for the unselected cases of bronchiolitis reported by Derish et al. (1998). If we make the assumption that there is an increase in V\nD/V\nT ratio during bronchiolitis (Almeida-Junior et al. 2007) as well as a change in respiratory system compliance (C\nrs) and resistance (R\nrs), continuing to ventilate a 5 kg infant at a rate of 30 breaths/min with P\ninf 16 cm H2O will result in P\naCO2 46 mmHg (graph A). Note that the inspiratory time (t\ni) has been increased to 0.50 s to allow inflation lung volume above FRC to reach 40 mL (i.e., 8 mL/kg). If the t\ni had remained the same as in \u201ccontrols,\u201d inflation lung volume above FRC would only be 3 mL/kg. Graph B shows the potential danger of responding to P\naCO2 46 mmHg with simultaneous increases in P\ninf to 20 cm H2O and ventilator frequency to 36 breaths/min. Lung volume above FRC rises to 10 mL/kg, and P\naCO2 falls to hypocapnic level (i.e., 31 mmHg).\n\n\n",

The estimate of P\naCO2 is now 109 mmHg. The deflation curve also shows the development of dynamic hyperinflation (see end-expiratory volume above zero). Graph B shows the effect of lengthening t\ni and decreasing the ventilator rate. The problem of dynamic hyperinflation continues, but tidal volume is improved. P\naCO2 is nowhere near being fully controlled (i.e., 93 mmHg), but further increase of P\ninf, lengthened t\ni, and slower ventilator frequency will bring P\naCO2 to more tolerable levels.",

In less severe cases, with modest decrease in C\nrs, standard approaches should not cause harm providing ventilator rates are limited to 30 breaths/min. In more severe cases, in the absence of lung function testing, clinical observation of inspiratory and expiratory chest excursion as well as regular auscultation is important. The aim in the \u201cobstructive\u201d lung is to avoid overventilation, with associated hyperinflation, and barotrauma. Ventilatory management should therefore take account of two guiding principles:Achieve adequate but not necessarily normal arterial blood gases. Adequate oxygenation is considered present with P\naO2 > 60 mmHg (8 kPa) or SpO2 > 88 %. Adequate minute ventilation is considered present with any value of P\naCO2 that achieves pH > 7.25 (so-called permissive hypercapnia strategy; see Sect. 50.6.1).Avoidance of overdistention of hyperinflated lungs by limiting V\nT to 6\u20138 mL/kg. This goal may even necessitate MV at slow ventilation rates (10\u201315 breaths/min) with prolonged expiratory times to limit ventilator-associated dynamic hyperinflation and impaired minute ventilation. (MV of \u201crestrictive\u201d lungs is discussed in Sect. 50.6). Our recommendation is that ventilator rate should be limited <30 breaths/min.\n",

In combination, these drugs will alter the CO2-ventilatory response, with a decrease in the slope and an increase in the apnea threshold (Yaster et al. 1990). These features are useful when applying the permissive hypercapnia strategy (see Sect. 50.6.1). However, these effects may be detrimental after extubation since the expected protective response to worsening gas exchange will be blunted, hence the need for continued close observation 12\u201324 h after extubation (see 4.5.3). When neuromuscular blockade is required, vecuronium (50\u2013100 \u03bcg/kg/h) can be used. The main reason for neuromuscular blockade is to enable MV at either very slow rates or fast (HFOV) rates and prevent ventilator-patient asynchrony. As will be discussed later, neuromuscular blockade is not necessarily required during HFOV (see Sect. 50.6.2).",

However, the use of PEEP in bronchiolitis is controversial. Not all centers use it, but in those that do, it is used at levels between 3 and 15 cm H2O (Table 50.2). In bronchiolitis, low-level PEEP during MV is used with the idea that it decreases airway resistance and improves gas exchange (Wren et al. 1982; Frankel et al. 1986). But it is also possible that PEEP may not have these desired effects in bronchiolitis because airways of such infants are smaller and may not be distensible. To date, studies of lung mechanics and PEEP have shown varied results (Smith et al. 1993; Gauthier et al. 1998; Marchal et al. 1998). Smith et al. (1993) studied the effect of increasing PEEP in steps of 3 cm H2O (0\u20139 cm H2O) and found that applied PEEP at any level failed to consistently improve passive expiratory airway resistance or increase compliance from baseline. Inadvertent or auto-PEEP (i.e., the accompanying residual airway pressure at end expiration in MV patients) occurred in all cases (5 \u00b1 2 cm H2O), but it had no influence on the response of mechanics to applied PEEP, except that peak inspiratory pressures increased when applied PEEP was greater than auto-PEEP. (It should be noted that the presence of auto-PEEP requires that applied PEEP be set at the same level in order to optimize expiratory flow.) In contrast to the Smith et al. (1993) findings, Gauthier et al. (1998) contend that there may be an optimum level of PEEP in acute bronchiolitis (Marchal et al. 1998).",

Last, when significant levels of PEEP are being used, it should not be forgotten that it will further complicate the cardiac-pulmonary-renal interaction of bronchiolitis that results in abnormal water and electrolyte homeostasis (Gozal et al. 1990; Poddar et al. 1995). Therefore, whenever PEEP is used, fluids, electrolytes, and hydration must be closely monitored. Our practice is to restrict water to 67\u201375 % of maintenance requirements. Careful attention should also be given to cardiac function and the need for volume and inotropes (Simpson et al. 1974; Njoku and Kliegman 1993; Kim and Frankel 1997; Arnold et al. 2000; Checchia et al. 2000).",

One limitation in assessing R\nrs, and therefore making some conclusion about airway obstruction, is that the measurement is codependent on airway caliber and lung volume; bronchodilation and decrease in air trapping have opposite effects, and few studies have reported lung volume changes. Hammer et al. (1995, 1997) found that most infants requiring intubation and MV have evidence of obstructive airway disease with reduced flows, air trapping, and a component of restrictive lung disease. Albuterol inhalation affected either all or none of the measured lung functions; if a decrease in R\nrs occurred, it was always accompanied by a reduction in air trapping. Figure 50.5 illustrates this point. The nomenclature is the same as Fig. 50.3. The figure uses the mean data of \u201cobstructive\u201d patients reported by Hammer et al. (1997). The upper panel shows that in these selected patients (more severe than the cases reported by Derish et al. (1998); see above), MV with a rate of 20 breaths/min (t\ni 1.00 s) and P\ninf 20 cm H2O would result in P\naCO2 93 mmHg. The middle and lower panels show the hypothetical effect of influencing either R\nrs or C\nrs or both together. Graph A in the middle panel shows the effect on inflation and deflation of halving R\nrs from 0.38 to 0.19 cm H2O/mL/s. Lung volume above FRC is increased, and there is reduction in dynamic hyperinflation. The theoretical consequence on P\naCO2 is a reduction from 93 to 58 mmHg. Graph B in the middle panel shows the effect of increasing C\nrs from 2.85 to 4.28 mL/cm H2O. Dynamic hyperinflation is worsened, and there is no improvement in P\naCO2. Graphs A and B in the lower panel show the combined effect of making the above changes in R\nrs and C\nrs but simultaneously rather than separately. Graph A shows that dynamic hyperinflation remains, but there is the additional problem of overinflation with tidal volume 12 mL/kg. Initially, P\naCO2 will be driven down even further to 49 mmHg. Graph B shows that decreasing t\ni from 1.00 to 0.75 s will lessen the effect of dynamic hyperinflation (estimated P\naCO2 62 mmHg), but an even slower ventilator rate may be needed.\n\n",

It is therefore not surprising that the usefulness of \u03b22-adrenergic drugs (e.g., salbutamol and albuterol) remains controversial in standard clinical practice. The results of studies are mixed, and many infants fail to show clinically significant improvement, but this finding is probably a reflection of the variation in (or lack of) abnormality in R\nrs (Derish et al. 1998). There is also some evidence that combined \u03b2- and \u03b1-agonists (e.g., epinephrine) are more effective, because of their additional vasoconstrictor effects, which decrease bronchial mucosal edema and hence airflow obstruction (Sanchez et al. 1993; Menon et al. 1995; Numa et al. 2001). These potential beneficial effects, however, may be outweighed or masked by other drug effects having an opposite influence on blood gases. For example, all of these drugs increase total body oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, and energy requirement by their direct or indirect effects on other organs through \u03b2-receptor stimulation (Newth et al. 1997b).",

The strategy allows for a degree of hypercapnia provided the arterial pH does not fall below a preset minimum value; it may be used in combination with a degree of permissive hypoxemia with SpO2 ~88 % in order to minimize mean airway pressure and hence barotrauma. Reda et al. (1997) reviewed their experience of this strategy in 29 infants with RSV bronchiolitis and reported significantly less barotrauma and shorter duration of MV and hospital stay. In contrast, Tibby et al. (1999) had a different experience in their 28 infants. They could achieve the strategy \u2013 as demonstrated by mean P\naCO2 7.6 kPa (57 mmHg), mean pH 7.34, and maximal peak inspiratory pressure 25 cm H2O \u2013 but it did not result in improved survival, less barotrauma, or less nosocomial infection, when compared with their experience before using this strategy. Furthermore, the duration of MV was longer, although not statistically significant. The authors concluded that since they could not show a benefit of permissive hypercapnia, a prospective randomized controlled trial is needed. These reports are over 10 years old, and it is likely that equipoise is now lost. Most attendants incorporate a version of permissive hypercapnia in conventional MV for bronchiolitis (see Sect. 50.5.1). Again, it comes down to the mechanical cost of trying to achieve normal P\naCO2 and the benefit of permitting higher values so that reduced ventilator settings can be applied.",

Interestingly, the authors found that infants with RSV had significantly longer periods on HFOV compared with those with other causes of lower airway disease (10.5 vs 6.8 days). Recently, however, Berner et al. (2008) reported much shorter duration of HFOV (5.0 \u00b1 1.6 days) in nine infants with RSV bronchiolitis (5.0 \u00b1 1.6 days). The authors attributed this result to better P\naCO2 control brought about by their practice of allowing infants to breathe spontaneously while on HFOV. This practice is used sometimes in neonatal care (Froese and Kinsella 2005). There are reasons why this approach is beneficial in infants. In children and adults, spontaneous breathing during HFOV leads to discomfort and distress which is probably due to the high level of imposed work of breathing (van Heerde et al. 2006a, b). In bench testing, with simulators, the level of imposed work of breathing in \u201cpatients\u201d heavier than 25 kg exceeds normal physiologic work of breathing by ~200 % (van Heerde et al. 2006b). In contrast, simulations for infants weighing 3.5 kg show a low level of imposed work of breathing; hence, infants are able to tolerate spontaneous breathing during HFOV.",

            "text": "This collected experience, over 20 years, raises two important questions. Why do some infants have such severe course of illness? Does our MV management make lung disease worse? It is beyond the scope of this chapter to review the literature on the biology of severity of RSV disease and genetic predisposition. Khan et al. (1995) and Flamant et al. (2005) suggest that bronchopulmonary dysplasia is an important risk factor. The question of whether attendants can make lung disease worse is also important and concerns us here. The series reported by Khan et al. (1995) was collected during 1989\u20131995, a time when HFOV was not in general use. This fact is reflected in the pre-ECMO summary measures of MV, which indicate high-pressure ventilation: mean peak inspiratory pressure 36 \u00b1 5.5 cm H2O (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), mean PEEP 5.8 \u00b1 2.2 cm H2O, and mean airway pressure 20 \u00b1 4.7 cm H2O. In addition, the normal pre-ECMO pH 7.43 \u00b1 0.13 and P\naCO2 5.8 \u00b1 2.1 kPa (44 \u00b1 16 mmHg) suggest that the contemporary target for MV was normal gas exchange even at the cost of high MV pressures, rather than a more permissive approach to hypercapnia that we would now accept (see also Sect. 50.6.1). Given that 96 % of these infants survived, the implication is that many such infants would not need ECMO where current standards are applied. The Flamant et al. (2005) supports this notion. This series was collected during 1996\u20132003 and 70 % of their ECMO cases had been on HFOV and 64 % had received inhaled nitric oxide before ECMO (see also Sect. 50.7.2). The authors do not provide any pre-ECMO pH or P\naCO2 data for comparison.",

A multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 39 non-intubated infants using a heliox mixture with 78 % helium within 8 h of admission to PICU showed no difference in the proportion that required MV (19 % controls vs 22 % heliox group) (Liet et al. 2005).

Patients receiving heliox nasal CPAP had a greater decrease in clinical score compared with air-oxygen nasal CPAP (2.12 vs 1.08 points) and a greater decrease in transcutaneous PCO2 (9.7 vs 5.4 mmHg or 1.3 vs 0.7 kPa).

The essential points to remember are:The progression in deteriorating pulmonary mechanics is decrease in respiratory system compliance (\u201cbronchiolitis\u201d), followed by combined decrease in respiratory system compliance and increase in respiratory system resistance (\u201cobstructive\u201d), followed by a state where low lung volume and very low respiratory system compliance predominate (\u201crestrictive\u201d).The acute deterioration in pulmonary mechanics \u2013 bronchiolitis and obstructive \u2013 is accompanied by increased dead space-to-tidal volume ratio and pulmonary ventilation-perfusion inequalities.Before endotracheal intubation, the aim of respiratory support is to overcome the exaggerated work of breathing and abnormal lung mechanics and allow for resolution of the primary pathophysiology. Various forms of noninvasive CPAP have a role.After endotracheal intubation, each phase of the condition \u2013 bronchiolitis, obstructive, and restrictive \u2013 requires different strategies. In the acute phase, focus on the time course of lung inflation, respiratory system resistance, and the pulmonary time constant for deflation will limit overinflation and dynamic hyperinflation.

In the acute graphs (a and c), total work of breathing is increased compared with the recovery phase. Elastic work decreases with increasing respiratory rate, and viscous work increases with increasing respiratory rate. It is more efficient to breathe at higher respiratory rate during bronchiolitis as demonstrated by the vertical lines that show the breathing rate of the infant during each stage of illness.
