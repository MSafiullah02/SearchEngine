            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein (Pedersen, 2009). FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein (Motokawa et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996). Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes FIP. Stoddart and Scott (1989) reported that the proliferation in macrophages was associated with the virulence of FIPV because FECV exhibited a lower proliferation in macrophages than FIPV. It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation (Chang et al., 2010, Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998), but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. Recently, Brown et al. (2009) theoretically demonstrated that FIP develops via the horizontal infection of FIPV. On the basis of their theory, FIPV and FECV are prevalent among cats.",

It has been suggested that TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, and GM-CSF produced by FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages are involved in the formation of granulomatous lesions (Takano et al., 2009b). On the other hand, the effusion has been considered to result from increased vascular permeability induced by a type-III hypersensitivity reaction. It was assumed that immune complex-mediated damage to vessels causes increase in permeability of endothelial cells in cats with FIP (Weiss and Scott, 1981a, Weiss and Scott, 1981b). However, it has been reported that there are no immune complexes in the vascular lesions of cats with FIP (Kipar et al., 2005). Specifically, factors other than the type-III hypersensitivity reaction may also cause the effusion in cats with FIP.",

It was reported that VEGF was thermostable (Clauss et al., 1990). Based on these facts, VEGF may be a vascular permeability-associated factor existing in the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. To verify this concept, we should examine whether an anti-feline VEGF antibody can inhibit the permeability of feline vascular endothelial cells, induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no antibodies that neutralizes feline VEGF activity. We will create a monoclonal antibody to neutralize feline VEGF and examine whether this antibody can inhibit the vascular permeability induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. The culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages contained VEGF in a smaller amount (about 20 pg/ml VEGF) than rfVEGF (400 pg/ml). However, it showed increased vascular permeability. Thus, the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages contained vascular permeability factors other than VEGF. According to a recent report, TNF-\u03b1 increases the vascular permeability induced by VEGF (Stathopoulos et al., 2007). Like VEGF, TNF-\u03b1 is thermostable (Takano et al., 2007b). We should also examine whether TNF-\u03b1, like VEGF, is involved in the vascular permeability induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages.",

On the other hand, Hantavirus reportedly shows increased susceptibility to VEGF and increased vascular permeability in virus-infected vascular endothelial cells (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2008). It is unknown whether FIPV infects vascular endothelial cells. No report has been published on FIPV antigen detection from the vascular endothelial cells of cats with FIP.

To elucidate the pathology of FIP, it is desirable to conduct experiments using feline vascular endothelial cells. However, no report has been published on the use of feline vascular endothelial cells in FIP research. One of the reasons for this, no feline vascular endothelial cell line is available. In addition, as experienced in this study, a method to isolate vascular endothelial cells from SPF cats requires many cats and skills. Even if cells are successfully isolated, their use in experiments is limited by the number of passages. When a feline vascular endothelial cell line is established, it will allow the easy handling of cells and may facilitate further elucidation of the mechanism of pathological deterioration in FIP.",
