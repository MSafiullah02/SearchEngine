The key component is self-learning in the sense that the targeted population learns digital operational skills without the need of a teacher. This is achieved through the adaptation of the training material to the trained group. As training groups are diverse, e.g., including both populations in developing and developed countries, and varying in age aspects, gender, languages, literacy levels and technological literacy levels, materials and the speed which training takes place has to be adapted to take into account these differences. The methodology involves use of training videos, and use a dual screen approach where training material is shown on one screen and training takes place on a second screen (computer). The approach has been evaluated in both developing countries and developed countries, with training groups of different capabilities and backgrounds (in Kenya, El Salvador, Spain, France and The Netherlands), with promising results.",

            "text": "The second-level digital divide, in particular, operational skills, is an important social issue both in developing countries an in developed countries. In developing countries, young people need to have certain skills (for example, effective use of text editors and spreadsheets) in order to get a better job. In developed countries, society is clearly becoming more digital, providing many new digital services, some for very basic services like to get a doctor appointment, at a fast pace. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable people are often left behind. Many seniors, migrants and minorities are suffering social exclusion due to their lack of digital literacy, Thus, large segments of the population lacks the necessary skills to interact effectively with such digitalized services To address the second-level digital divide, in particular, operational skills, the usual approach to train the population, both in developing and developed countries, involves face-to-face training with teachers, since the usual training material (MOOCS, etc.) is not suitable for those without the most basic digital skills. However, often such face-to-face training activities has limited effectiveness. The typical training in groups has many problems: logistics (participants with different time availability) and pedagogical (participants with different learning speed) problems, and teachers are sometimes ill-equipped to deal with individuals not only experiencing digital illiteracy but also experiencing low literacy in general. Of course, there are many qualified teachers but, in general, scaling such face-to-face training activities to be able to train big sectors of a population is very costly in terms of the human resources needed; in general it is simply not a sustainable activity. In addition when the trainees are located in rural or remote areas the human resources needed (teachers) may not be available in sufficient quantities. In developing countries typically both problems occur, i.e., too high training costs, and limited availability of qualified teachers.",

In the practical studies we have conducted (see Sect. 3) assuring that the practical necessities for conducting the literacy training (e.g., availability of working computers, access to literacy training material) are met is the responsibility of a local training coordinator, who does not need to be familiar with the literacy training material. Use of a two-screen approach: The methodology follows a learning-by-doing approach where the trainee is presented with two screens: (i) one, typically a tablet, where the training material, a number of videos, is shown and (ii) a second one, typically a desktop computer, used by the trainee to practice the practical exercises shown in the first screen. The benefits of using dual screens has been studied in a number of works, e.g., [4, 7] . Adapting training material to the trained group: When training diverse populations the training material used should be localised, e.g., in general with respect to languages utilised, with respect to literacy levels, etc. In general such a localisation (e.g., in the website domain [11] ) process typically consists of a translation to a language and a cultural adaptation. In our methodology, both the language used for instructions, and the video speed, is adapted to the trained groups: (i) Language adaptation: normally the videos are in the native language of the trainees. However, in the case of migrants, they may choose to either receive instructions in their native language or in the language of the country they currently reside; (ii) Age adaptation: for instance, the speed of the videos is slower for elderly people than for younger people; (iii) Literacy adaptation: for instance, the language in the video is \"simpler\" for people with low literacy than for other with higher levels of literacy; (iv) Gender adaptation, for instance, we use inclusive language;",

The project had the following main activities: (i) definition of training contents, including the collaborative process with project participants to obtain the agreed upon training program for each collective; (ii) development of the audiovisual material; (iii) conducting training session to evaluate the success of the approach. The results were measured as follows. First, a pre-questionnaire was created to measure the operational skills owned by the target population before taking the course. Secondly, a post-questionnaire was designed to measure the acquisition of the same skills after taking the course. In Madrid, a group of 42 Arab migrants and 28 seniors attended the training; in Pairs 26 seniors; and 28 Arab migrants in The Netherlands. We are still analysing the detailed results, but the informal feedback we have received has been very positive, with several participants for instance telling us that they were able for the first time to make an appointment with a doctor using an online system. A detailed analysis showing to what extent the goals of the project has been met, through measuring the outcome of the training sessions (e.g., to what extent trainees can successfully use medical digital systems), will be presented in a future article.",

The approach works with specially developed software training applications, and uses a two-screen approach. The methodology has been applied in a number of training events in Kenya, El Salvador, and Europe. In all locations students reported an improvement in their operational skills due to the training. Based on these findings, we are now working on reducing the amount of work needed to adapt the overall methodology to different contexts, e.g., to account for differences in language, gender, literacy, etc.We believe that our methodology holds great promise, and future plans include demonstrating its potential for training on a significantly larger scale. Moreover, we are eager to cooperate with other institutions that share the ambition of reducing the second-level digital divide.",
