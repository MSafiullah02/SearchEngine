            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused a pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. It erupted in many other countries in the following months and eventually became a worldwide pandemic. The pneumonia was officially named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. So far, the pandemic is still accelerating. More than 3.7 million people were confirmed infected, 260,000 more people died globally [2], and the virus transmission is expected to last for more than one year [3]. At the same time, other types of coronaviruses and influenza viruses, which have been widespread in the world, may invade human society again during this winter or in other circumstances, circulating together with the SARS-CoV-2 and causing more serious respiratory diseases [4, 5]. It is necessary to investigate whether the simultaneous prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, such as IAVs, can promote the spreading of each other. In addition, because the clinical symptoms caused by CoVs and IAVs infection are very similar to each other [6], it will bring further challenges to clinicians in the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients. This article will summarize and compare the epidemic characteristics, clinical symptoms, treatment, and prevention measures for the diseases which are caused by CoVs or IAVs respectively, hoping to provide a brief comparative information for the clinicians and researchers who are working in the related fields.",

As shown in Figure 1\nA, S protein is located on the surface of virus particles, which plays a key role in virus entry into host cells, and is also one of the major targets of antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. CoVs are divided into four genera which belongs to Coronaviridae, alpha, beta, delta and gamma CoVs. So far, there are seven CoVs causing human diseases, including three highly pathogenic CoVs (HPCoVs) (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) and four normal human CoVs (abbreviated as HCoVs) (HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) [12]. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha genus, while the other 5 CoVs belong to the beta genus. The genes of S protein from the three HPCoVs form 3 clusters, as shown in the polygenetic tree in Figure 1A. Compared with MERS-CoV, the S protein gene of SARS-CoV-2 is a little bit closer to SARS-CoV, as reported they are sharing about 50% identity [13].",

Viral proteins were translated by mRNAs through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus system for packaging into mature viral particles with the progeny RNA in the cytoplasm. Then the virions was transported to cell membrane and released by exocytosis [7, 15].",

As shown in Figure 1C, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are distributed on the surface of virus particles, which are the basis for subtype classification of IAVs and also play important roles during the process of virus invasion and mature virus releasing [17, 18]. Like S protein of CoVs, HA and NA are very important targets of antiviral drugs and vaccines [[19], [20], [21]]. In recent 30 years, three subtypes of IAVs, including H1N1pdm09 virus causing 2009 flu pandemic [22], and two highly pathogenic avian viruses, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, had caused severe respiratory diseases and resulted in thousands of deaths or high mortality in humans [23, 24]. The majority subtype of seasonal IAVs is H3N2 [25]. The polygenetic tree in Figure 1C displays the three clusters of HA genes. They show a distinct difference from each other, with the HA gene of H5N1 virus generating more mutations during its transmission as reported [26].",

As illustrated in Figure 1D, IAV binds to receptor \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid (H7N9 and H5N1) or \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid (H1N1 and H3N2) to form endosome and enters into cell, and the viral RNA was released into the cytoplasm by viral-endosome membrane fusion. Then the viral RNA is imported into the nucleus, and once there starts both virus RNA transcription and replication. After mRNAs and progeny negative-sense RNAs are exported to cytoplasm, the proteins are translated and trafficked to the cell membrane into packaged RNAs. The mature virus then buds from the cells [27].",

            "text": "For the spread of viruses, there are no borders between countries as more and more interactions and cooperation were established worldwide. Since the CoVs and IAVs were identified as the major pathogens for respiratory diseases in last century, they have traveled to many corners of the world [28, 29]. The transmission and infectivity related information of these viruses were summarized in Table 1\n. There are two seasonal flu viruses included, HCoVs and H3N2 IAV (HCoVs represents four CoVs that cause seasonal cold, HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, for convenience in following discussion, they will be denoted as one CoV in this article.). They usually cause moderate clinical symptoms and spread globally [28, 30]. The rest of six viruses either show high pathogenicity or are highly transmissible, which could cause much danger for human society. These viruses are called here as HPHTs, which stands for high pathogenicity or highly transmissible viruses. Of the HPHTs, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is accelerated due to its ability to transmit through airborne droplets during the incubation period [31]. That it may also transmit between human and animals becomes another challenge in the control of the pandemic [31]. Another two viruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, reported in 2012 and 2003 respectively, caused mortalities of 35% and 9% in patients respectively. Their transmission mostly started after the patients started showing clinical symptoms [15, 32]. Therefore, they could not travel in humans too long before being discovered and controlled. All ages of people were susceptible to these 3 CoVs, but senior people were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develop more severe clinical symptoms, while mostly younger people were infected with SARS-CoV [33, 34].",

Besides the well documented Spanish flu in 1918, H1N1pdm09 virus spread to 214 countries one year after it appeared in USA in 2009 [35]. It was noticed that the virus caused more deaths in people who are younger than 65 [36]. Some scientists deduced that the senior people may carry the immune memories from those induced by 1918 H1N1-like flu viruses in their early years, which cross protected them from the H1N1pdm09 virus attack [37]. However, the fact is that the 1918 H1N1 virus also caused more deaths in younger people [38]. H7N9 and H5N1 viruses were limited in transmission due to the similar reason mentioned above with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, the mortality of H7N9 is as high as 37%, and H5N1 is 53% [39, 40]. Nevertheless, the high pathogenicity and high mortality make them easier to be identified and controlled at the beginning of the break. Although H7N9 and H5N1 viruses transmitted in humans ineffectively, their geographic expansion and genetic recombination still suggested the potential of forming the next pandemic [41, 42].",

Hemagglutinin glycoprotein, located on the surface of influenza virions [133], plays a critical role in virus attachment and membrane fusion. Accompanied with HA structure characteristics elucidated, HA inhibitors appear to be one of the most promising candidates [[134], [135], [136], [137]]. With high efficacy and broad antiviral activity, some inhibitors targeting HA such as DAS181 and arbidol are currently in clinical development stage or partly approved for influenza virus infection [[138], [139], [140]]. Considering the antigen drift and shift of IAVs, the conserved regions on HA, such as the HA1 receptor binding sites (RBS) and the HA2 stem domain, are more attractive for new drug design [[141], [142], [143]]. A number of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies targeting above the two domains have been identified. For example, CR9114 exerts a broader antiviral effect against both influenza A and B viruses in mice by binding to HA stem domain, which may be useful for the treatment of severe influenza disease [144].",

SGIMI also developed a second one using artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) modified with lentivirus vector carrying similar genes with LV-SMENP-DC (NCT04299724). Two inactivated vaccines were approved for clinical trial as well, developed by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and Sinovac Research and Development Co., Ltd (NCT04352608) [147, [149], [150], [151], [152]].",

There are many types vaccines approved in US with trade names such as FluLaval, Fluarix, Agriflu, and Flublok. A live attenuated vaccine with the name of FluMist was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in US in 2003, and which is delivered through nasal spray [157]. To decrease side effects, animal and insect cells were also approved to replace chicken embryos for growth of vaccine strain [158]. To provide protection from most seasonal virus attacks using one shot, multiple dominant viruses were included into one vaccine, such as those containing 3 or 4 different circulating strains and called trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines [158, 159]. Before a universal vaccine was successfully developed, it is necessary to switch vaccines strains year by year as the prevalent influenza viruses mutate their genes or change their subtypes very frequently to escape from the immune recognition [24, 29].",

In contrast, MERS-CoV, H7N9 and H5N1 viruses rarely transmit between humans. SARS-CoV, H1N1pdm09, and H5N1 viruses easily infect younger people. Severe patients usually infected with HPHTs develop bilateral pneumonia, ARDS, respiratory failure, and even death. CT and autopsy showed that the main pulmonary pathological manifestations were DAD, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar and interstitial edema, fibromyxoid exudation, etc. At present, there are no specific and effective drugs or vaccines for the treatment and prevention of CoVs. However, thanks to clinicians\u2019 and scientists\u2019 efforts worldwide, some promising progress has been made in the treatment of the diseases. Although there are some drugs and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of IAVs, it is still necessary to further research and develop more effective methods of treatment and prevention to better control the influenza epidemic.",
