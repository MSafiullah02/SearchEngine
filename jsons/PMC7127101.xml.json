The active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro has a catalytic dyad with the sulfur of Cys145 as a nucleophile and the imidazole ring of His41 as a general base.4 Therefore, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be considered an attractive target for developing effective drugs against SARS.",

Subsequent bioactivity-guided fractionation of the CHCl3 extracts led to the isolation of four quinone-methide triterpenoid derivatives11 that were identified as celastrol (1), pristimererin (2), tingenone (3), and iguesterin (4) on the basis of their spectroscopic analyses (Fig. 1\n).12\nT. regelii is a woody vine native to Eastern and Southern China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.13 This plant known as \u2018Thunder God Vine\u2019 has been historically used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and Behcet\u2019s disease.14 A number of triterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes as a major compound have been isolated from the bark of T. regelii and are known to have a variety of biological activities with good cytotoxicity to numerous cancer cell lines and efficacy in several rodent models of arthritis and other inflammatory disease.15 However, their SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activities have not been reported. In this study, we wish to describe the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activities of the four quinone-methide triterpene derivatives 1\u20134 and semi-synthetic dihydrocelastrol 5.",

According to Schwalbe\u2019s result,17 celastrol (1) possesses electrophilic sites within the A and B rings, where nucleophilic groups of cysteine thiol group of cell division cycle protein 37 (Cdc37) reacts with the quinone-methide of 1 through a Michael addition, resulting in the formation of an adduct at C6. Thus, we believe that this moiety would be valuable for enhancing the inhibitory activity of 3CLpro. In fact, our result showed that quinone-methide moiety of 1 (IC50\n = 10.3 \u03bcM) increased the potency of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibition by twofold when compared with the reduced analogue 5 (IC50\n = 21.7 \u03bcM) (Table 1).

            "text": "To better investigate the interaction of these inhibitors with the enzyme, we attempted a molecular docking simulation of the binding of 4 and 5 into SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site. The X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with a substrate-analogue inhibitor (coded 1uk4 or 2z3e)18, 19 obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) was used for modeling analysis. Computer docking analysis20 revealed that iguesterin (4) can fit well into the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As shown in Figure 4\nA, the hydroxyl group of C3 of 4 formed a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Cys 44 and OH of Thr 25 located in domain I (residues 8\u2013101),9 whereas dihydrocelastrol (5) did not form any intermolecular bonds with the enzyme besides the hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 4B). Iguesterin (4) binding mode has different from betulinic acid (His164 and Thr24) and savinin (Cys145, Gln166, Gln189, Gly143 and Ser144) with 1uk4. These differences of intermolecular interaction apparently are reflected by the 10-fold smaller IC50 value of iguesterin (4) compared with that of reference compounds in inhibiting the 3CLpro. Moreover, the calculated binding energy (kcal/mol)19 of all quinone-methide triterpenes are shown in Table 2\n. These docking experiments support the observation in the enzymatic assay, which reveals the important roles of the quinone-methide moieties inhibition of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Although this preliminary molecular modeling study cannot be final proof for this critical argument, it constitutes a positive sign for the possibility of the mechanism.",

Although all isolated quinone-methide triterpenes has previously been known compounds, this is the first time it has been shown to possess SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity. We are hopeful that these preliminary data may be able to open new avenues for research targeted toward reducing the threat of SARS to the global community. Further research and drug development on quinone-methide triterpenes as promising SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors are ongoing in our laboratory and the results will be reported in due course.",
