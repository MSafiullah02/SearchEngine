            "text": "Persistent viruses cause chronic disease, and threaten the lives of immunosuppressed individuals. Here, we elucidate a mechanism supporting the persistence of human adenovirus (AdV), a virus that can kill immunosuppressed patients. Cell biological analyses, genetics and chemical interference demonstrate that one of five AdV membrane proteins, the E3-19K glycoprotein specifically triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor IRE1\u03b1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not other UPR sensors, such as protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The E3-19K lumenal domain activates the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease, which initiates mRNA splicing of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1). XBP1s binds to the viral E1A-enhancer/promoter sequence, and boosts E1A transcription, E3-19K levels and lytic infection. Inhibition of IRE1\u03b1 nuclease interrupts the five components feedforward loop, E1A, E3-19K, IRE1\u03b1, XBP1s, E1A enhancer/promoter. This loop sustains persistent infection in the presence of the immune activator interferon, and lytic infection in the absence of interferon.",

Mammalian cells express two homologs of the yeast Ire1p, IRE1\u03b1 (encoded by the ERN1 gene) and IRE1\u03b2 (ERN2), the latter in a tissue-specific manner, for example in the digestive tract 37, 38 . To explore the role of IRE1\u03b1 in AdV infection, we used CRISPR/ Cas9 to generate IRE1\u03b1-knockout HeLa cells (HeLa I-KO). A guide RNA targeting exon 2 yielded a KO phenotype affecting all three allelic copies of IRE1\u03b1 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b) . Two IRE1\u03b1 alleles were edited by frameshift mutations and one had a 15-nt in-frame deletion. HeLa I-KO was significantly less susceptible to AdV-C5 infection than HeLa or HeLa I-KO ectopically expressing IRE1\u03b1 from a lentivirus, as shown by AdV late protein VI expression and virus production (Fig. 1a) . Infection inhibition was not due to reduced virus entry, as the incoming vDNA was effectively delivered into the nucleus 2.5 hpi 39 (Supplementary Fig. 1c ). Akin to IRE1\u03b1 KO, the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C 40 reduced viral replication, as shown by quantitative (q)-PCR (Fig. 1a) .",

Note that the band denoted with asterisk (*) is a background product and can be removed by EndoT digest (see Supplementary Fig. 1d ). XBP1s (denoted as 1S) was not enhanced in HeLa I-KO cells, but restored by ectopic expression of IRE1\u03b1 (Fig. 1b) . Importantly, XBP1s induction occurred in AdV-C2 or C5-infected HeLa and human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, or in diploid human fibroblasts WI-38, but not in cells infected with AdV-C5 lacking the E1 region ( Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1e-g) .

In contrast, PERK did not show an upward shift upon AdV-C5 infection, unlike treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), a known activator of PERK 45 (Fig. 2c) . We found no evidence that AdV-C5 induced the regulated IRE1\u03b1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway, unlike DTT, as assayed with Bloc1S1 mRNA (see Supplementary Fig. 2a) .",

In UPR, the association of the ER chaperone BiP/Grp78 (BiP) with IRE1\u03b1 decreases upon initial ER stress, and restores under persistent UPR stimulation, when BiP and co-chaperones are transcriptionally induced 46, 47 . We assessed the levels of BiP-IRE1\u03b1 by immunoprecipitation experiments of Flag-hIRE1\u03b1 expressed in IRE1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs at near-endogenous levels 43 . The coimmunoprecipitation data, western blots, and rt-PCR measurements of E1A mRNA showed that BiP dissociated from IRE1\u03b1 at 7 hpi, when only low amounts of E1A protein were present, and neither 19K protein nor XBP1 splicing were detectable (Fig. 2d) . This was in contrast to conventional UPR induced by DTT where BiP-IRE1\u03b1 dissociation was rapidly followed by XBP1 splicing (Supplementary Fig. 2b ). Similar results were obtained in HeLa I-KO cells transduced with lentivirus encoding Flag-hIRE1\u03b1, where BiP dissociated from IRE1\u03b1 at 4 h post AdV-C2 infection (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d) . In MEFs, AdV-C5 lacking E1A and E1B ORFs did not dissociate BiP from IRE1\u03b1, in contrast to a mutant lacking the 19K ORF (Fig. 2e) . Notably, AdV-C5 infection did not increase the levels of BiP and IRE1\u03b1, unlike treatment with DTT, which massively increased the BiP levels ( Fig. 2f) . Accordingly, the ectopic expression of BiP did not attenuate the induction of XBP1s by AdV-C2, unlike thapsigargin treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 2e , f), consistent with earlier reports 46 . Collectively, the data indicate that AdV activates IRE1\u03b1 in a non-canonical manner, whereby BiP dissociates long before XBP1 splicing, and independent of 19K. f a AdV-C2 (h) 24 48 Tg ( An early AdV gene product activates IRE1\u03b1. E1A activates all early viral promoters, and together with E1B enhances transformation and replication 48, 49 . We assessed if viral replication was required for the IRE1\u03b1/XBP1s induction by treating HeLa cells with the nucleoside analog cytosine arabinoside (AraC), which blocks viral replication and late protein expression past the immediate early phase of E1A induction 50, 51 . AraC neither affected the E1A expression nor the levels of XBP1s (Supplementary Fig. 3a ). In contrast, an inhibitor of the positive transcription elongation factor, flavopiridol, blocked E1A expression 24 hpi as expected 52 , and wiped out the induction of XBP1s ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). The data reinforce the notion that E1A is required for XBP1s induction.",

Phos-tag SDS-PAGE indicated that a mutant lacking the 19K ORF (AdV-C5-\u039419K) poorly induced IRE1\u03b1 phosphorylation, and barely induced XBP1s at 24 hpi unlike AdV-C5 (Fig. 3b) . Similar results were obtained in time-course studies in HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3d) . Remarkably, the AdV-C5-\u039419K-infected cells showed reduced E1A expression levels compared with AdV-C5. This finding was in accordance with the RNAi data against 19K, where a pool of more than a dozen synthetic dsRNAs targeting 19K strongly reduced the induction of XBP1s, and also reduced the expression of E1A, while control RNAi pools against E4-Orf4 had no effect on E1A ( Supplementary Fig. 3e ).",

All three chimeras had comparable expression levels and induced XBP1s, but 19K lacking the LD only weakly induced XBP1s (Fig. 3d , and Supplementary Fig. 3g ). The human MHC class-I antigen binding defective M87A 19K mutant 35 strongly induced XBP1s, indicating that MHC-I binding was not required for XBP1s induction (Fig. 3d) . The expression of the C2 19K-LD alone with or without a C-terminal HDEL motif activated IRE1\u03b1 to comparable levels as the fulllength protein, and much more effectively than the D8 19K-LD or full-length 19K (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 3h , i).

This underscores that 19K alone or in context of AdV-C infection induces the phosphorylation of endogenous IRE1\u03b1 followed by XBP1 splicing.

To test if 19K interacted with IRE1\u03b1, we stably expressed C2 19K in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, yielding a reticular ER-like pattern in the cytoplasm ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Immunoprecipitation of 19K by the monoclonal IgG antibody 3A9 significantly enriched IRE1\u03b1 compared with pulldowns with a control IgG, suggesting a complex of IRE1\u03b1 and 19K. We next tested if the lumenal domains of C2-19 K and IRE1\u03b1 interacted in the ER. Tripartite split-GFP fluorescence complementation assays were used in cells expressing the 19K-LD and IRE1\u03b1 or PERK-LD. The Flag-IRE1\u03b1 containing the 20-amino-acid domain GFP10 at the C terminus and the C2 19K-LD with the C-terminal 18 amino acids of GFP11 gave rise to reticular ER-like green fluorescence signals in transfected cells expressing signal sequence containing GFP1-9 with a HDEL ER retention signal (Fig. 4a, b) . Green fluorescence signals colocalized with the anti-19K and anti-Flag immunostainings validating the GFP complementation signals. In contrast, no green fluorescence was obtained with Flag-tagged PERK-GFP10-LD, although both 19K and PERK localized in reticular cytoplasmic Three independent experiments gave similar results.

Flag-IRE1\u03b1 expressing IRE1\u03b1-KO MEFs at 7, 16, and 24 hpi with AdV-C5 (MOI 300) immunoblotted with anti-IRE1\u03b1 antibody. Lysates were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel containing 25 \u00b5M Phos-tag. Samples were treated with or without alkaline phosphatase. Phosphorylated (p) and hypophosphorylated (o) forms of IRE1\u03b1 are indicated by the dashed lines, and the percentage of IRE1\u03b1 phosphorylated was calculated as indicated. Lysates are the same as in panel D demonstrating \u03b2-tubulin loading. Three independent experiments gave similar results.

Cells were lysed and BiP-IRE1\u03b1 complexes immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag antibody, and a western blot with anti-IRE1\u03b1, anti-BiP, and anti-\u03b2-tubulin antibodies was performed. A separate non-reducing immunoblot probed with anti-19K Tw1.3 antibodies revealed monomeric and dimer forms of 19K indicated as mo and di, respectively.

The ectopic expression of XBP1s enhanced the E1A protein levels under the viral E1A-e/p in HeLa and HDF-TERT cells (Fig. 5b) . The application of the IRE1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C reduced E1A expression, indicating that both XBP1s and IRE1\u03b1 boost E1A expression in the absence of other AdV gene products (Fig. 5b) . In contrast to XBP1s and IRE1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 reduced E1A expression.

To test if XBP1s bound to the E1A-, E4-, and ML promoters, ChIP analysis of AdV-C2infected cells was performed. XBP1s antibodies enriched the E1A, MLP, and E4-e/p regions fivefold to sevenfold over isotype control antibodies (Fig. 6b) . The deletion of the four E1A XBP1sbinding sites in E1A significantly reduced E1A expression in HDF-TERT cells from dl309_\u039463-95 compared with dl309, most prominently, if XBP1s was overexpressed (Fig. 6c) . This result was supported by site-specific mutagenesis of the five XBP1sbinding sites (ACGT, CCACG, and CACG boxes) yielding AdV-C5-XBP1s-mut, which showed strongly attenuated E1A expression compared with AdV-C5 (Fig. 6c ).

The E1A-wild-type viruses dl309 and AdV-C5 were used as controls. HDF-TERT cells were seeded onto xCELLigence plates, treated with IFN-\u03b3, infected 36 h later, and incubated in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 until 22.5 days post seeding, followed by IFN-\u03b3 washout and incubation for another 13.5 days.

While dl309 and AdV-C5 infections led to cell death after 12.5 and 11 days, respectively, in the presence of intermittent amounts of IFN-\u03b3, the dl309_\u039463-195 and the AdV-C5-XBP1s-mut-infected cells remained viable throughout the course of the experiment to about 36 days (870-h time point), akin to uninfected cells (Fig. 7c) . Under IFN-\u03b3, the titers of dl309_\u039463-195 and AdV-C5-XBP1smut did not rise (middle panel), and the cells remained viable as shown by phase-contrast microscopy and impedance measurements using xCELLigence, indicative of only low levels of persistence, whereas titers of dl309 or AdV-C5 increased by 10 2 \u221210 3 -fold, indicating high persistence of E1A normal viruses (Fig. 7c) .

Green fluorescence is restored when proteins containing the GFP10 and GFP11 domains are in close proximity together with the core GFP1-9 targeted to the ER lumen. b Interaction of C2 19K-LD with IRE1\u03b1-LD but not PERK-LD. HeLa cells co-transfected with C2 19K-LD-GFP11, SS-(signal sequence)-GFP1-9-HDEL, and Flag-IRE1\u03b1-GFP10 or PERK-LD-GFP10 were fixed and stained with anti-19K (3A9) and anti-Flag antibodies and DAPI (nuclei). Confocal images were segmented with CellProfiler using DAPI as a nuclear mask, and the reticular ER signal was measured in a ten-pixel area around the nuclei.

Statistical analyses were done by two-tailed Wilcoxon nonparametric tests with significance *p < 0.001. Two independent experiments gave similar results. b E1A expression from the E1A-e/p can be increased by ectopic XBP1s, or reduced by the IRE1\u03b1 inhibitor 4\u00b58C in HeLa cells (left panel). A similar experiment was carried out in HDF-TERT cells including IFN-\u03b3 to suppress the E1A promoter/enhancer expressed from a lentivirus vector (middle panel). E1A expression in HDF-TERT cells is reduced by RNA interference against IRE1\u03b1 and XBP1, but not by nontargeting siRNA (siNeg1, 20 nM siPools, right panel). Error bars represent standard deviations. For all the graphs, data are presented as mean from two technical replicates, and two independent experiments gave similar results.

This may be akin to a subset of ER-targeted cellular mRNAs, signal recognition particle RNA, ribosomal RNAs, or transfer RNAs, which can directly activate IRE1\u03b1 64 triggers the transition of IRE1\u03b1 from a closed to an open conformation, and leads to IRE1\u03b1 oligomerization 65 . Consequences of IRE1\u03b1 activation comprise inflammatory reactions in conjunction with activation of pattern recognition receptors 66 . The LD of C2 19K and IRE1\u03b1 was in close association based on immunoprecipitations and split-GFP complementation assays. This mode of IRE1\u03b1 activation contrasts with a recent lipid stress activation model of IRE1\u03b1, where BiP binding to IRE1\u03b1 is not affected 43, 67 . Importantly, IRE1\u03b1 activation by C2 19K was independent of 19K interaction with MHC-I in the ER lumen, The initiation of XBP1 mRNA splicing is a key output from activated IRE1\u03b1 reviewed in refs. 9, 68 . XBP1s is central in boosting lytic and persistent AdV-C2/5 infections. Lytic infection could be rescued by overexpression of XBP1s in IRE1\u03b1 KO cells. More specifically, XBP1s was found in a complex with the E1A-e/p in infected cells, and boosted E1A (and also 19K) expression, and lytic infection. The XBP1s-binding sites on the E1A-e/p are distantly located from the E2F-Rb repressor-binding sites 36 , a configuration that allows for coregulation by repressors and stimulators, which we show here is crucial in AdV persistently infected cells in the presence of IFN-\u03b3. The concept of coregulation by activators and repressors is found with herpes viruses and HIV, where transcriptional coregulation occurs during persistence 69, 70 . In accordance, the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C, which reduces XBP1s, reduced AdV-C5 persistence in HDF-TERT cells under IFN-\u03b3.",

This supports both lytic and persistent infection of HDF-TERT cells, as indicated by AdV-C5 mutants lacking functional XBP1s-binding sites in the E1A-e/p. In nonlymphoid cells, the E3 promoter, which lacks XBP1sbinding sites is controlled by E1A, and in lymphoid cells, it is E1A-independent but NF-\u03baB dependent 71 . This may lead to cell death. For example, TNF\u03b1 exposure induces ER stress, IRE1\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB activation, and exacerbates death signaling through the TNF receptor 1, involving c-JUN N-terminal kinase 72 . If and how AdV antagonizes this signaling pathway is unknown. Alternatively, other host transcription factors could be involved in E3 regulation. For example, SP1, which is induced by XBP1s 60 has 29 predicted binding sites in the E3 promoter, and could enhance E3 transcription. Regardless of the nature of the E3 promoter regulation, the deletion of the 7.1K and 19K region in AdV-C5 reduced viral persistence in Syrian hamsters 73 . Our data highlight the therapeutic potential of the IRE1\u03b1 branch of the UPR, and converge on the notion that in Zika virus-infected human and mouse embryos, the UPR was observed in the cerebral cortex of postmortem fetuses, and the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C reduced the microcephaly frequency 74 . In conclusion, the selective activation of IRE1\u03b1 by 19K provides an environment conducive for AdV persistence, and supports the lytic cycle under conditions of impaired immunity.",

For the construction of tripartite split-GFP plasmids, lumenal domains of E3-19K from AdV-C2 or D8, and Flag-tagged human IRE1\u03b1 or PERK was PCR amplified (Supplementary Table 2 ) and inserted into pcDNA 3.1 plasmid having the GFP11 and 10 domains, respectively. The rest of the GFP1-9 and GFP1-10 domain was inserted after Css at the N terminus and ER retention signal HDEL at the C terminus and cloned in pcDNA 3.1. For full-length split-GFP constructs shown in Supplementary Fig. 4b , IRE1\u03b1-GFP11 and 19K-GFP10 pair was chosen due to the better signal:noise ratio of this pair. For IRE1\u03b1, GFP11 domain was inserted at the linker region after the transmembrane domain of IRE1\u03b1. The rest of the GFP domains 1-9 were cloned in pcDNA 3.1. One hundred nanograms of all the plasmids were transfected in HeLa or 293T cells using Lipofectamine transfection method. Forty-eight hours later, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained with anti-Flag and anti-E3-19K (3A9) antibodies and imaged with high-throughput and confocal microscopes to measure the expression levels. The number of cells was determined with DAPI staining. Total tripartite split-GFP puncta were identified using custom-made CellProfiler script (Supplementary  Table 4 ) and plotted using JMP 13.",
