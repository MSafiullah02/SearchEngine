This is exactly what critiques of European neoliberalism were asking for. 5 The nation states are taking action within the boundaries of their national democratic constitutions and the EU legal order. 6 They act through legislative packages to save the lives of their citizens and EU citizens in border regions through the establishment of a safety net for the economy, for employees and for companies. The COVID-19 threat dictates the order of assistancehealth first, then money; society first, the economy second. This order demonstrates and explains the weakness of the EU as a quasi-state with a quasi-constitutional legal order built around enumerated powers and the still-remaining foundational powers of the Member States as the guardians of the Treaty in terms of the management of societal crises.

The window will not remain open for long. The longer the shutdown lasts, the stronger the voices will be to return to normal, to bring people back to work, to get the economy going again; and the more the political debate around crisis management turns to its economic implications, the easier it will become for the EU to gain ground again and to integrate national crisis management into the European legal order and into the set of competences the EU has and that allows it to manage the economic effects of the COVID-19 threat. Depending on the depth and length of the expected recession, one might even think of a much more radical scenario, one where the Member States use the EU as a catalyst to promote a hard-core version of economic neoliberalism where the social and environmental achievements of recent decades are blown away as barriers in order to relaunch the economy.",

The Internal Market has not been suspended, at least not with regards to the cross-border trade in goods and services. What is mainly suspended is personal freedomin EU language, the free movement of persons and non-essential business activities in areas where small and medium-sized companies dominate. There will be lessons to learn as to who will benefit from the crisis -Member State politics, national governments, multinationals, online business, transport of goodsand who will suffer: the EU as an institution, the European legal order based on the four freedoms and competition, national parliaments, small and medium-sized companies and non-essential economic sectors. A stocktaking will be needed on what remains of the European legal order after COVID-19 and whether and to what extent the state of emergency the Member States have proclaimed could be brought into line with EU law. This is the kind of clean-up that lawyers are accustomed to doing as a repair service for society and the economy.",

            "text": "What, then, does rethinkingthinking the unthinkableimply? Thinking the unthinkable does not relate to Krastev's \"After Europe\" 8the dissolution of the EU overnight. The majority of European legal scholars might in one way or the other sympathise with Baquero Cruz, 9 with the deeper historical origins of the \"Law after Auschwitz\" (the heading of Cruz's chapter 2): its peace through trade mission, a rejection of the return to the nation state and the political and theoretical opportunity for a serious and substantial reform of the EU. In rethinking, there is no need to start from scratch. From the 1990s onwards, growing critical legal scholarship has accompanied the eastern enlargement of the EU and the feasibility of a European Constitution and of a European Civil Code. By and large, the critique has fallen on deaf ears: the eastern enlargement was pushed through against warnings about the impact of the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach on the former socialist economies, let alone the lack of democratic institutional structures and a society that subscribes to liberal democratic values. The failed European Constitution was saved in the Lisbon Treaty, and the failed European Civil Code was broken down into a bunch of regulations and directives that breathe the same spirit. In the COVID-19 threat, the criticism appears in a different light, not as a laborious attempt to change the direction of European politics, but as a possible scenario for a new beginning. In what follows, I would like to tie three strands of discussion together: the COVID-19 threat, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the circular economy, as well as the digital economy and society. Only such a holistic perspective opens up pathways for a new European Economic Constitution and a new European private law post-COVID-19.",

The exclusion of the social impact of the Internal Market on national societies and on an infant European society builds the first strand of critique that unites philosophers and legal theorists. In his letter to P. van Parijs, Rawls asks whether \"meaningless consumerism\" could be a legitimate aim for the EU and for a European society. 10 Davies and Taguri highlight the societal and cultural implications of ever-increasing consumer choice in the Internal Market. 11 The one-sided promotion of online business, which empties our cities and transforms physical communication into online orders, is just one visible expression of what is excluded from the toolbox of European lawnot only to investigate potential gains in economic growth through increased efficiency and increased effectiveness of political objectives through fully harmonising European private law rules, but also to seriously look into their impacts on society.",

The eastern enlargement seems to teach the lesson that there are limits to the role of law in post-communist states, where society had been suppressed for over 40 years. This does not mean that European law cannot play a much larger role in the making of a European society. The nonexistence of a fully-fledged European state opens up morenot feweropportunities for the law to enable society-building. 12 This implies understanding the law of the Internal Market as the law of the Internal Market society. 13 The addressee of such a legal order is the consumer citizen, the worker citizen, the employer citizen. Such an understanding breaks down the fragmentation of the legal person in the EU 14 and establishes a common umbrella for status-related European laws (non-discrimination, labour and consumer law). Whether it is feasible to combine citizenship with economic rights is subject to controversy. 15 In an admittedly optimistic reading, I have tried to formulate out of the bits and pieces of European private law de lege lata a tripartite distinction between universal services, the law of the labour market society and consumer market society and societal private law. 16",

            "text": "The second potential for rewriting the European Economic Constitution is the everlouder call for sustainability, which reached the EU through adoption of the circular economy in 2015. The COVID-19 threat provides the earth with breathing space. The Juncker Commission has brought to a \"successful\" end a whole range of regulations and directives that cover broad fields of economic and private law. These newly adopted legislative measures follow the Internal Market philosophy, the rationality of market efficiency piggy-backing on social regulations on consumer and environmental protection. They are united in that sustainability and the circular economy are downgraded to a few window-dressing references in the recitals without any conceptual rethinking, let alone re-conceptualising. Sustainability goals translated into the circular economy are kept strictly separated from economic (Internal Market) and private law. There is no attempt to initiate a debate that the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the circular economy, if taken seriously, might require a different economic constitution and a different private law. What is urgently needed is a serious stocktaking of the state of affairs in terms of European private law in the light of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that highlight the dark side of one-sided rules that protect employees and consumers without taking their counterproductive effects on the environment into account. 17 In his \"many constitutions\", K. Tuori 18 distinguishes between the framing of juridical and political constitutions and the sectoral constitutions: micro-and macro-economic, social and security constitutions. Neither he nor von Bogdandy and Bast 19 in their compendium mention the possible existence of an environmental/sustainable constitution. The bits and pieces enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 191 TFEU render it difficult if not impossible to deduce concrete consequences of the positioning of the environment in relation to the micro-and macro-economic constitution. 20 Here is the place for a political commitment by the Member States to give shape to a new European economic constitution. The COVID-19 threat is supposed to strengthen the transformation of the nation state into a steering state -\"l'\u00c9tat Providence\" in the format of the precautionary state. 21 The EU Member States will have to make sure that the healthcare sector will never again suffer from shortages in life-saving medical devices and pharmaceuticals and that essential industries that are indispensable for fighting the next pandemic threat are located within the EU if not on national territory. The transformation will affect the European Economic Constitution and the interplay between private entrepreneurship and de facto nationalised industrial sectors. The huge safety net that the Member States are currently building with taxpayers' money is the means through which the EU Member States intervene in the economy. The very same means could and should be understood as an opportunity to build a sustainable economy that deserves its name. Financial aid could be bound to sustainability.",

The private law of contracts and private regulation through contracts, codes and standards beyond the nation state enables and promotes digitisation. The EU is at the forefront in setting legal standards through the General Data Protection Regulation, the Copyright Directive, the Platform-to-Business Regulation and, last but not least, through the Directive on Digital Content. The rationale is again to promote economic growth in the Internal (digital) Market through digitisation. The bits and pieces are pillars of an emerging European digital constitution in which the proclaimed human-centred artificial intelligence risks falling by the wayside. The post-COVID-19 wonderland should not be entered without a deeper understanding of the political economy behind digitisation. 22 Digitisation will be used ever more strongly to consider if, how and to what extent algorithms, machine learning techniques and neuronal nets can reduce the social costs of labour, which will have a huge impact on our societies. 23 The COVID-19 threat will accelerate and legitimise the digital transformation of society and the economy. However, the very same crisis must be seized as an opportunity to make sure that technology serves, in the words of Brownsword, \"the anterior conditions for humans to exist and for them to function as a community of agents\". 24 In the scholarly debate on digitisation and the impact of economic and private law, there seems to be agreement that red lines are needed that cannot be crossed by anyone and that should not be submitted to a balancing test. 25 The digital constitution is supposed to set benchmarks for all sorts of European, national and private regulation that governs private relations in the digital society and economy.",
