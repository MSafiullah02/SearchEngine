            "text": "Leishmaniasis: Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoal organisms of the genus Leishmania and is transmitted in Mediterranean regions by the bite of an infected female sand fly. The vector in North America is not known. In the United States, the disease is considered endemic in Texas, Ohio, and Oklahoma 8 but also has been reported in several other states. Several forms of the disease, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral forms, have been identified in dogs. Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania donovani, has been transmitted clinically by blood transfusions in dogs, with clinically healthy foxhounds as blood donors. 9 In 1 study, 30% of English Foxhounds tested were seropositive for Leishmania spp. 9 Another study examining the seroprevalence of antibodies against Leishmania in the United States found 2 non-foxhound dogs to be seropositive. Both of these dogs had negative test results by PCR assays. 10 Because of the severity of the clinical disease and its known transmission via blood transfusion, it is recommended that all foxhounds and dogs with travel history to or from endemic areas be screened for Leishmania spp. As with Babesia, screening for Leishmania involves initial IFA testing, with seropositive dogs excluded. Seronegative dogs can be screened additionally with Leishmania PCR. It should be noted that the IFA for Leishmania spp. can cross-react with Trypanosoma cruzi, and seropositive animals should also be evaluated for the presence of specific antibody against T cruzi. 10 Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, Neorickettsiosis: Dogs are known to be infected by a variety of Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Neorickettsia spp. organisms in the family Rickettsiaceae. In general, these organisms are arthropodborne; several are known to be tickborne. Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (previously Ehrlichia equi, the human granulocytic ehrlichial agent), and Anaplasma platys (previously Ehrlichia platys) are known to infect dogs naturally and can produce disease. Neorickettsia risticii (previously E risticii var. atypicalis) and Neorickettsia helmintheca are the most common organisms in this genera known to infect dogs. 11 Of all of these agents, E canis is probably the most commonly described in the dog and causes acute, chronic, and subclinical syndromes. Experimentally, subcutaneous inoculation of the organism, mimicking natural transmission by tick vectors, results in dose-dependent infection and positive blood cultures. 12 Screening of potential blood donor dogs for antibodies against E canis can be performed by IFA assay. The consensus of the ACVIM Ehrlichial Disease Infectious Disease Study Group in 2002 was that IFA titers to E canis \u03fd1 : 80 should be interpreted with caution because they could be false positives but that titers \u03fe1 : 80 were likely to be true positives. 13 For dogs with low titers, repeated serologic testing (within 2-3 weeks), PCR, or Western immunoblotting is recommended. A commercial point-of-care E canis enzyme immunoassay (EIA) antibody screening test a also is available for screening for E canis antibodies. This assay requires a ''threshold'' antibody titer of at least 1 : 100 for positive results. Given the widespread geographical distribution of the disease and its subclinical form, the consensus is that potential blood donor dogs should be screened by IFA or screened with the point-ofcare test for E canis, and positive animals should be excluded as blood donors. Because cross-reactivity among E canis, E ewingii, and E chaffeensis might not always occur, dogs that are seronegative for E canis antibodies should be additionally screened by genus-specific PCR, especially in those areas where E ewingii or E chaffeensis are endemic. Individual blood banking programs also might want to pursue further testing with PCR or IFA for other Anaplasma or Neorickettsia species.",

Male dogs can harbor the organism in the prostate and epididymides, and urine and seminal fluid can serve as the source of infection.

Cats serve as a reservoir for a number of Bartonella species, including Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, and Bartonella koehlerae. Infected cats typically have a prolonged, asymptomatic bacteremia, but uveitis and endocarditis have been reported. 34, 35 Fleas can harbor the organism and are believed to be the likely vector. 36 Natural transmission of B henselae by blood transfusion is likely because the organism is an intraerythrocytic bacterium, 37 but cases of bartonellosis resulting from clinical transfusion have not been reported. Bacteremia can be produced experimentally in cats after transmission of infected blood. 38 Transmission of some Bartonella species from infected cats to humans does occur, with cat scratch fever the most frequently documented B henselae-induced disease. 39 Blood culture or PCR are used to detect current infection, and serology provides evidence of previous or current infection. One study in the United States and western Canada showed a seroprevalence for B henselae of 27.9% in 628 pet cats, with regional variability. 40 Another study showed that B henselae and B clarridgeiae bacteremia was found in up to 50% of the domestic and feral cat populations in regions where fleas were endemic. 41 However, B henselae infection was only documented by PCR assay in 2 of 117 (1.7%) community source cats used as blood donors in the United States. 32 Serologic cross-reactivity among B henselae and B clarridgeiae and B koehlerae does not always occur, but blood culture and PCR are capable of detecting all Bartonella species. Although sensitive, blood culture can take up to 4-6 weeks to perform, and bacterial isolates require molecular characterization such as PCR or DNA sequencing to confirm their identity. Treatment does not consistently lead to elimination of the organism. 42 The panel was divided on screening recommendation for Bartonella. All authors felt it would be ideal to strive for a Bartonella-free donor pool, but several factors, including the potential pathogenicity and epidemiology of feline bartonellosis, led to a division of the panel on whether or not to categorize feline bartonellosis in the recommended or conditional group. Four of 7 authors recommended routine screening of feline blood donors, with seropositive, PCRpositive or blood culture-positive cats excluded from donation. Three of 7 authors felt that the lack of current in-formation on the pathogenicity of the organism and the possibility of a high prevalence of pre-existing infections in some areas warranted a conditional recommendation.",

The organism infects erythrocytes and can be transmitted experimentally via blood. 47 The fatal form of the disease develops after tick transmission of the organism or after experimental administration of infected tissue homogenates. In naturally occurring disease, the majority of infected cats develop severe anemia and die within 5 days. A chronic carrier state has been identified in Arkansas and Tennessee. 48 No commercially available serologic or PCR test is available for C felis, and blood smears must be examined for the signet-shaped piroplasm in erythrocytes. Because the majority of infected cats are ill and the carrier state is geographically limited, the disease is considered of low priority when screening clinically healthy cats as potential blood donors. Use of indoor cats and appropriate ectoparasite prophylaxis are advised to avoid this disease in donor animals.",

In the presence of any of these findings, culture should be performed to determine whether contamination has occurred. If the unit appears abnormal, it should not be administered. 4. Currently, veterinarians cannot rely on screening of individual units for infectious disease because of the turnaround time and costs of available tests.
