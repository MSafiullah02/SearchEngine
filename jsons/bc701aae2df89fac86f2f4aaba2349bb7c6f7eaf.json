The decision to perform Cesarean delivery was based on either a confirmed or suspected maternal diagnosis of COVID-19, and the obstetricians' desire to shorten the course of delivery. All three newborns were tested for COVID-19 in accordance with governmental policies requiring testing of newborns of mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. In all three cases, the obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists and nurses wore full personal protection equipment (PPE) including an N-95 mask, eye goggles, face shield, and a top-to-bottom tight-fitting gown, entering the operating rooms ~5 five min before the patients. Notably, only obstetricians touched both the mothers and newborns during the time of Cesarean delivery, handing the newborns off to the neonatologists after delivery. The resuscitation tables for newborns were ~ 3 m away from the head of the mothers. The operating rooms in cases 2 and 3 were equipped with negative pressure to minimise virus spread. The environmental surfaces of operating and inpatient rooms were routinely decontaminated with chlorine 2000 mg L -1 disinfectant for 30 min after patients had exited operating rooms or were discharged from inpatient rooms. Medical staff followed PPE doffing procedures according to standard guidelines, which included spraying the surfaces of PPE with 75% ethanol before removal and washing hands after doffing.",

Additional laboratory evaluation showed marked abnormalities (Supplemental Table 1 ). The mother's course was notable for fever, tachypnoea and hypoxaemia. She had a Cesarean delivery under general anaesthesia with rapid sequence induction and easy intubation using videoassisted laryngoscopy on day 9, and delivered a male with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. The mother did not have regional anaesthesia due to abnormal liver function and coagulopathy. The anaesthesia circuit had an electrostatic filter to avoid contaminating the machine and gas scavenging system. The operating room was not a negative-pressure Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). The mother wore a face mask except during intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

The mother recovered well and was discharged home on day 26; 19 days after delivery no caregivers had developed COVID-19.

            "text": ") and tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on postpartum day 6. The woman had had an urgent Cesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia on January 31, 2020, with the delivery of a newborn boy (Apgar scores of 3 and 5 at 1 and 5 min, respectively). The mother wore a mask during the procedure and had mild coughing. The newborn initially had asphyxia and was clinically managed in the OR for ~ 10 min without intubation. The newborn was then transferred to an isolation room in the neonatal ICU, and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on PND 8 and 20. Because he had a fever on PND 3, lungrales and abnormal laboratory results [leucocytes 15.7 x 10 9 L -1 , neutrophils 72.1%, lympocytes 19.1% , C-reactive protein 25.1 mg L -1 , ESR 31 mm, LDH 528 U L -1 , CK-MB 38 U L -1 ], and because his mother had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, a chest CT scan of the newborn was performed on PND 6 that showed findings suggestive of COVID-19 (Figure 1). Respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and other infections were excluded. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the clinical and CT scan criteria. These three women infected with COVID-19 in the peripartum period had three different maternal and neonatal outcomes. The first case suggests mother-to-newborn transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during an urgent Cesarean delivery under general anaesthesia. The other two mothers both had urgent Cesarean deliveries under spinal anaesthesia; one baby never became infected and the other baby was diagnosed with COVID-19 despite negative SARS-CoV-2 testing. It is not clear whether transmission of COVID-19 to the newborn in case 1 occurred in utero or in the operating room, recovery room or community while being cared by his grandmother (wearing a mask), or whether the route of transmission was via airborne droplets, personal contact, or blood. The newborn in the third case who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 had clinical symptoms and classical chest CT findings consistent with COVID-19, although other acute lung diseases could also cause the CT findings. Nevertheless, this report highlights the risk of mother-to-newborn transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and suggests that more systematic investigations are warranted to determine if vertical transmission is possible. The lessons learned from this case series are: (1) the numbers of visitors should be minimised; and (2) sufficient PPE is important to prevent caregivers from infection of COVID-19.",
