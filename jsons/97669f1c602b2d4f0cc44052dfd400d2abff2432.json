Characteristic RNA sequences within RNA virus genomes or RNAs transcribed from DNA virus genomes contribute toward this inhibition. In this study, we developed a method called \"Fate-seq\" to comprehensively identify the RNA sequences derived from RNA and DNA viruses, contributing RNA stability in the cells. We examined the stabilization activity of 5,924 RNA fragments derived from 26 different viruses (16 RNA viruses and 10 DNA viruses) using next-generation sequencing of these RNAs fused 3\u2032 downstream of GFP reporter RNA. With the Fate-seq approach, we detected multiple virus-derived RNA sequences that stabilized GFP reporter RNA, including sequences derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Comparative genomic analysis revealed that these RNA sequences and their predicted secondary structures are highly conserved between SARS-CoV and the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the global outbreak of the coronavirus-associated disease that emerged in December 2019 . These sequences have the potential to enhance the stability of viral RNA genomes, thereby augmenting viral replication efficiency and virulence.",

The Fate-seq system incorporates the following procedures: Fate-seq revealed that multiple viral sequences, including 21 viral sequences derived from the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), were relatively stable. Furthermore, the sequences of the identified viral sequences derived from the SARS-CoV genome were highly conserved within the Coronaviridae family, and some of the conserved sequences have a potential to form notable secondary structures. Additionally, the secondary structures are conserved in the novel coronavirus related to the ongoing coronavirus-associated disease outbreak that first emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, the viral sequences identified by Fate-seq may enhance the genomic stability of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 within their hosts, where they have potential to inhibit the host's cellular RNA degradation machinery and to contribute toward viral replication efficiency and virulence.",

More than 95% of the reads could be aligned, of which approximately 55% and 45% mapped to the forward and reverse strand, respectively. We then quantified the number of reads that aligned on the region of the viral sequences. Note that, since the total abundance of the introduced mRNA library decreased in a time-dependent manner, the counts in each sample were not absolute but were rather indicative of relative abundance among the mRNAs introduced into the cells. To identify viral sequences that confers RNA stability, we searched for the viral sequences with statistically significant increase in 6h compared to 0h samples. From the 11,848 viral sequences (corresponding to 5,924 fragments from forward and reverse strands), we filtered lowly-expressed sequences, resulting in the remaining 7,442 sequences. Among these, 625 viral sequences (377 from DNA viruses and 248 from RNA viruses) were significantly increased in 6h compared to 0h (adjusted p-value < 0.05) ( Fig. 1E ; Table S3; Table S4 ). These included viral sequences derived 7 from various RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV. Since the 1,087 viral sequences derived from RNA viruses were derived directly from the parental viral genomes, these were considered more likely to function in a similar manner in vivo in host cells. Therefore, we focused on the viral sequences derived from RNA viruses, especially SARS-CoV, which is the RNA virus species with the highest number of increase viral sequences (Table S3) , for further analysis. The SARS-CoV genome used to design the viral sequences consists of 29,751 bases, generating 296 viral sequences from the forward strand. Among these 296 viral sequences, 21 viral sequences significantly increased in the 6 h samples ( Fig. 2A ; Table S5 ). We termed these sequences \"RNA stabilizing regions\".",

To cope with host responses, certain viruses inhibit the innate immune system and RNA degradation through the suppressor activity of characteristic viral RNA sequences. For example, high-dimensional RNA sequences such as those containing stem-loops or the pseudoknots typical of the flavivirus [termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA)] interrupt the progress of XRN1 along the viral genomic RNA, thereby inhibiting RNA degradation and resulting in the accumulation of degradation intermediates [3,4]. These partially degraded viral genomic RNAs inhibit TRIM25, an ubiquitin ligase recognizing RIG-I, which then inhibits the host immune response. The Group C enterovirus contains phylogenetically conserved RNA structures that competitively inhibit RNase L, the antiviral endoribonuclease in host cells [5]. Thus, several viruses have evolved to carry RNA fragments with characteristic highdimensional structures within their genomic RNA or in RNAs transcribed from their genomic DNA to regulate the fate of viral replication in host cells through the regulation of RNA degradation.",

Since Stem #1 is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is predicted to be a long and stable stem-loop, it may contribute toward the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. In silico mutations of COV001 in SARS-CoV of C to A at 17,114 nt and C to T at 17,144 nt formed a putative stem-loop similar in structure to that of Stem #1(Fig. 3C). Note that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions corresponding to COV001 and COV002 were almost completely conserved among the 1,116 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences sampled from human hosts (Materials and Methods): 1,107 genomes (99.2%) for COV001 and 1,109 genomes (99.4%) for COV001 were identical(Fig. S1), indicating that their secondary structures are also highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains. The co-occurrence of these mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may enhance the genomic stability of this virus within host cells through inhibition of the host's RNA degradation machinery, thereby contributing toward enhanced viral replication and virulence.",

The secondary structures in these two regions were inferred with theCentroidFold tool (http://rtools.cbrc.jp/centroidfold/). For in silico validation of the importance of the two observed SARS-CoV-2 mutations, C at 17,114 nt and C at 17,144 nt in the COV001 region of the SARS-CoV genome were replaced with A and T, respectively. The secondary structure of the modified sequence was also inferred using the CentroidFold tool. Author Contributions: H.W., K.K., and N.A. conceived the project.

A total of 26 different viruses were used to generate the viral sequences. (B) Structure of the vector library. The viral sequences were inserted immediately downstream of the EGFP coding sequence (CDS) in a reporter vector harboring the T7 promoter, the EGFP CDS, and a polyA stretch (A60). (C) The mRNA library. In vitro transcription (IVT) of the vector library was used to produce the mRNA library, in which each mRNA contained the EGFP CDS, a viral sequence, as well as a polyA stretch. (D) Transfection and retrieval of the mRNA library. The mRNA library was transfected into HeLa cells using electroporation, and the transfected cells were then divided into two wells. The mRNA retrieved from the cells immediately after the transfection was termed the \"0 h sample\". The mRNA retrieved from the cells 6 h after the transfection was termed the \"6 h sample\".
