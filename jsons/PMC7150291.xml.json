            "text": "Traditionally, the epidemiological control of most viral infections depends on the isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, personal protection by infection control measures and mass vaccination, because specific antiviral treatment is generally not available for most viral infections (Table 1\n). This scenario is rapidly changing with the increasing availability of rapid diagnostic tests which use nucleic acid amplification, and the development of an increasing number of effective antiviral agents. Common acute viral diseases such as respiratory, diarrheal, exanthematous, or neurological infections can overlap with each other and appear as seasonal epidemics, which peak in incidence every few years and coincide with the accumulation of sufficient number of nonimmune hosts in the young population. Arboviral disease activity often coincides with arthropod vector activity such as mosquito breeding in hot rainy seasons which are associated with increased incidence of hemorrhagic fever or neurological diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, West Nile virus, or Japanese encephalitis in Southeast Asia. Many chronic blood-borne viral illnesses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still taking a major toll in certain geographical regions due to specific human behaviors or vertical transmission. Some of these chronic viral infections such as HBV, HCV, HIV, polyomaviruses, and papillomaviruses are also linked to the genesis of cancers. Over 70% of emerging viral infections such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are associated with acute explosive outbreaks after the virus jumped the species barrier from bats or other animals into humans (Table 2\n). This article will focus on the prevention and control of viral infections, while other articles in this encyclopedia will cover information on specific viruses.",

Moreover, viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and do not grow in artificial culture medium. Collecting the correct clinical specimens during the peak of viral shedding in appropriate viral transport medium is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Electron microscopy is not sensitive and has a limited role in the examination of feces from viral gastroenteritis and vesicular fluid from skin lesions caused by herpesviruses and poxviruses. Virus isolation in cell lines or chick embryo is the gold standard for virological diagnosis but seldom alters clinical management due to its long turnaround time. Viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, and point-of-care rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays has significant impact on therapeutic and infection control strategies.",

Genotyping by nucleic acid amplification and sequencing for detection of mutations associated with antiviral resistance directly from clinical specimens are now available for many antiviral agents and are routine for antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection. Though nucleic acid amplification tests still have practical limitations in the field settings of developing areas, such tests are now routine in most hospitals in developed countries. Antibody testing by enzyme immunoassay for IgM in acute infection, IgG for immune status of exposed individuals, and retrospective diagnosis by the presence of rising antibody titers in paired acute and convalescent sera of symptomatic patients is useful for making clinical and epidemiological decisions. Antibody screening is especially important in antenatal visits of expectant mothers, blood donors, and organ donors and recipients before transplantation. Next-generation sequencing performed directly on clinical specimens may revolutionize virological diagnosis in the coming decade. The timely and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has important implications for effective epidemiological control in the community and infection control for hospital outbreaks.",

In a study from the USA, the annual death rate of health-care workers from occupational events was estimated to be 17\u201357 per 1 million workers, and most of these deaths resulted from infection-related complications of blood-borne viruses (Sepkowitz and Eisenberg, 2005). The overall risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses by hollow needle stick injury is 33%, 3%, and 0.3% if the source is a hepatitis carrier with positive HBe antigen or high viral load, hepatitis C carrier with viremia, and HIV, respectively. Compliance with standard precautions including wearing gloves when handling blood during patient care practice, disposing sharp needles into puncture-resistant box, and avoidance of recapping needles remain the most important ways to prevent nosocomial acquisition of blood-borne viruses (Garner, 1996).",

Postimmunization anti-HBs antibody level should be measured at 4\u20138 weeks after completion of the 3-dose immunization regimen given at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. A good responder is defined as a person whose anti-HBs antibody level is greater than 100 IU/L. If the hepatitis B antibody level is between 10 and 100 IU/L, a booster dose of vaccine should be given. For nonresponders whose anti-HBs antibody is less than 10 IU/L, another course of HBV vaccine should be given. The response rate is about 61% in repeated HBV vaccination by the same route as the initial vaccination (Struve et al., 1994). Alternatively, immunization with high-dose intradermal recombinant HBV vaccine, given in up to four doses, can achieve immunity in 88% of health-care workers who failed to respond to intramuscular vaccination and boosters (Levitz et al., 1995). The anti-HBs titer was persistently higher than the protective level for at least 10 years after primary HBV vaccination (Floreani et al., 2004).",

The source patient's blood is collected to check for the presence of HIV, HBV, and HCV. If the status of blood-borne viruses of the source patient is positive or unknown, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be offered according to current guidelines (Kuhar et al., 2013). The exposed health-care worker will be closely followed up for counseling, baseline and follow-up HIV testing, and monitoring for drug toxicity. If a newer fourth\u2013generation combination HIV p24 antigen-HIV antibody test is utilized for follow-up HIV testing, it may be concluded 4 months after exposure. Otherwise, follow-up HIV testing is performed 6 months after the exposure (Kuhar et al., 2013). For HBV, PEP with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or HBV vaccination should be considered for occupational exposures after evaluation of the HBsAg status of the source, and the vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person (2001). For HCV, PEP is not currently recommended. However, an open-label pilot trial was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and acceptance of peginterferon alfa-2b as PEP. Among 213 health-care workers exposed to an HCV antibody-positive source, 51 HCWs enrolled in the study and 44 (86%) elected to undergo peginterferon alfa-2b as the study group. Seven subjects who elected not to undergo PEP were treated as the control group. In this pilot study, peginterferon alfa-2b was proven to be safe without serious adverse effects. However, the lack of HCV transmission in both the study and control groups did not support the routine use of PEP in health-care workers after HCV exposure (Corey et al., 2009). It is likely that the new polymerase and protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HCV infection will result in new strategies for PEP of HCV exposures.",

            "text": "Blood-borne viruses can also be transmitted from health-care workers to patients, especially during exposure-prone procedures in dental and cardiothoracic operations. The most well-known example involved an HIV-positive dentist working in Florida, USA, who infected five of his patients after performing invasive dental procedures on them (Ciesielski et al., 1992). Sequencing of the HIV proviral envelope gene showed that the viruses infecting the dentist and the five patients were closely related (Ou et al., 1992). However, the overall risk for transmission of HIV from a health-care worker to a patient is very small. In a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 22 171 patients being cared by 51 HIV-positive health-care workers, 113 (0.5%) patients became HIV positive. Epidemiologic investigation did not implicate health-care workers as the source of infection in any of these patients (Robert et al., 1995). In contrast, transmission of HBV and HCV from health-care workers to patients was more frequently documented. Between August 1991 and July 1992, 19 of 144 (13%) patients who were operated on by a thoracic surgeon with acute HBV infection became HBV-infected. Sequencing of 160 bases in the core region of HBV showed an indistinguishable pattern among the strains of the surgeon and nine infected patients (Harpaz et al., 1996). Subsequently, numerous health-care worker-to-patient transmissions of HBV and HCV were reported. Among all these reported cases, the viral loads of the index health-care workers were more than 106 genome copies per ml (Buster et al., 2003; Gunson et al., 2003). In this connection, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) issued a guideline for the management of health-care workers who are infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV to impose restriction on different categories of exposure-prone procedures according to the viral load (Henderson et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Epidemiologically important respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus are predominantly transmitted by the droplet route. By definition, the virus can spread within 1 m from the index case. However, individuals infected with influenza A virus may produce as many as 40 000 droplets of 0.5\u201312 \u03bcm in size and expel them at a velocity of 100 m s\u22121 upon sneezing (Tang et al., 2006). Droplet nuclei of less than 3 \u03bcm may suspend in air and do not settle onto the ground (Knight, 1980). Therefore, an explosive outbreak with high clinical attack rate as a result of aerosol transmission may occur under special conditions. In a jet airliner with nonfunctioning ventilation system, 72% of 54 passengers developed influenza-like illness within 72 h after being kept on ground for 3 h due to delay in flight time (Moser et al., 1979). As the virus may survive on inanimate surfaces for 12\u201348 h, and on the surface of hands for 10\u201315 min (Kampf and Kramer, 2004; Kramer et al., 2006), influenza virus can be transmitted indirectly by contact with hands from the contaminated environment to the pharyngeal mucosa. Symptomatic influenza may develop after intranasal inoculation of 1 TCID50 of influenza A virus (Tellier, 2006). Hand hygiene is always the core component of infection control measures in both community and hospitals to prevent the transmission of influenza A virus. Wearing face masks by either the index case as source control or the health-care workers as contacts has shown to be equally effective in the control of nosocomial transmission of pandemic influenza A H1N1 (Cheng et al., 2010). Hand hygiene and face masks have been shown to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 h of the index patient's symptom onset (Cowling et al., 2009). Oseltamivir PEP halted an outbreak of pandemic influenza A H1N1 in a secondary school (Asiedu-Bekoe et al., 2012), but not in nursing homes (van der Sande et al., 2014).",

The exact mechanism of airborne transmission remains to be elucidated. However, an early study demonstrated that nosocomial outbreak of VZV occurred even when the index case was strictly isolated in a single room (Gustafson et al., 1982). There was a lack of nosocomial spread of VZV when all index cases were placed in negative pressure airborne infection isolation rooms (Anderson et al., 1985). Measles virus can survive in the air for at least 1 h, as shown in an outbreak where three susceptible children who contracted measles were never in the same room with the source patient and one of the three arrived at the office 1 h after the source patient had left (Bloch et al., 1985). A massive community outbreak of measles occurred in a modern suburban elementary school in New York in spring, 1974, when the index case produced 28 secondary cases in 14 different classrooms. The epidemic subsided after two subsequent generations when 60 children had been infected. From estimates of major physical and biologic factors, it was possible to calculate that the index case produced approximately 93 units of airborne infection (quanta) per minute, which was higher than that of patients with laryngeal tuberculosis (Riley et al., 1978, 1962). Early recognition and placement in airborne infection isolation room of index case of VZV and measles may reduce the risk of nosocomial outbreaks.",

Some of the respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and the gastrointestinal viruses, norovirus, and rotavirus are predominantly spread by direct contact. As an illustrative example, RSV is the most frequent cause of nosocomial infection in pediatric wards and causes lower respiratory tract disease in 40% of young children. Prolonged shedding of RSV for 3\u201311 days has been observed in immunocompetent children (Hall, 2000), and the virus can survive on inanimate surfaces for 6 h (Kramer et al., 2006). All these factors contribute to fomite-mediated transmission of RSV in the hospital. The risk of nosocomial RSV transmission was not related to age or underlying disease, but to length of hospitalization (Hall et al., 1975). Contact precautions with cohort nursing and wearing gloves and gowns during patient care resulted in a significant reduction in nosocomial transmission of RSV in three consecutive winters (Madge et al., 1992). In another study, the incidence of nosocomial acquisition of RSV was significantly decreased after implementation of wearing gloves and gowns and isolation of cases even though the duration of RSV shedding remained unchanged before and after the intervention (Leclair et al., 1987).",

As norovirus is unculturable, feline calicivirus has been used as a surrogate for in vitro and in vivo testing for different preparations of disinfectants (Gehrke et al., 2004; Lages et al., 2008). In the WHO formulation AHR, formula I preparation contains ethanol (80% v/v) which, based on the above studies, may possess reasonable virucidal activity for norovirus when the contact time is prolonged for up to 30 s. Successful control of nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus by directly observed hand hygiene has been reported, especially during high-risk nursing care practices such as changing napkins and feeding (Cheng et al., 2009). A proactive infection control approach with the provision of \u2018added test\u2019 was implemented to prevent the occurrence of nosocomial outbreak when the new variant of norovirus, genogroup II, type 4 (GII.4) was circulating in Hong Kong (Cheng et al., 2011). RT-PCR for norovirus was performed as an \u2018added test\u2019 by the microbiology laboratory for all fecal specimens that were requested for bacterial culture, Clostridium difficile culture or cytotoxin, and rotavirus antigen detection without a request for norovirus detection. During the study period, almost 50% of newly diagnosed norovirus infections were detected by the added test. Timely implementation of infection control measures by single room isolation of index case with strict contact precautions significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired norovirus infection from 131 (baseline) to 16 cases per 1000 potentially infectious patient-days (P\n < 0.001) (Cheng et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was the first emergence of an important human pathogen in the twenty-first century. SARS emerged as an outbreak of atypical acute community\u2013acquired pneumonia in late 2002. The epidemic may have started when a bat SARS coronavirus jumped into caged palm civets in a wildlife market and became adapted and amplified to jump from civet to human. Infected chefs and animal handlers transmitted the adapted virus to health-care workers and then the epidemic became amplified into the community. The epidemic was rapidly and globally disseminated when a \u2018super-spreader\u2019 of SARS, who was a medical professor from a teaching hospital in Guangzhou, went to Hong Kong on 21 February 2003. During his stay in hotel M, he transmitted SARS-CoV to other residents, and the secondary cases spread the disease to hospitalized patients in Hong Kong, and to other countries including Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Eventually, a total of 8096 patients were infected in over 30 countries among five continents and 774 (9.5%) of them died (Cheng et al., 2007a). Nosocomial outbreaks were reported in many parts of the world including Toronto, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Kaohsiung, Singapore, and Vietnam during the SARS epidemic. There were a total of 716 secondary and tertiary cases of SARS as a result of the admission of infected index patients. Health-care workers constituted 410 (52.3%) of the secondary and tertiary cases (Cheng et al., 2013). As there were no known effective antiviral agents or vaccine for the treatment and prevention of SARS, infection control measures and extensive tracing to quarantine the contact person became the most important interventions for SARS control. The longitudinal follow-up of SARS patients revealed that the viral load gradually increased on day 5 after symptom onset and peaked at day 10. Early isolation of source patients can prevent ongoing transmission of SARS in the community. In hospitals, temporary suspension of clinical services in both inpatient and outpatient settings was adopted (Gopalakrishna et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Nishiura et al., 2005; Reynolds et al., 2006), while home quarantine of health-care workers who had contact with SARS patients was also mandated in some centers (Dwosh et al., 2003).",

For the clinical definition, patient suffering from elevated body temperature or subjective fever or symptoms including severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage should be alerted, while the epidemiological definition includes close contact with a confirmed or probable case of EVD or residence in or history of travel to an affected area or countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) within 21 days before symptom onset. For health-care workers working in volunteer medical services or nongovernment organizations, who have had direct contact with patients in the affected areas or countries, should also perform medical surveillance or be placed in quarantine for at least 21 days after leaving the affected areas or countries. Medical evaluation should be sought promptly if there are any symptoms of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, or bleeding during quarantine or medical surveillance.",

During the influenza pandemic in 2009, school closures were practiced in the USA and Australia (Borse et al., 2011; Effler et al., 2010), because school closures were associated with a 65% reduction in the mean total number of contacts for each student as reported in a retrospective questionnaire survey in the United Kingdom (Jackson et al., 2011). In Hong Kong, kindergartens and primary schools were closed when local transmission of influenza A virus was identified in 2009, followed shortly afterward by secondary school closures for summer vacations. Influenza A virus transmission was estimated to be reduced by 25% (Wu et al., 2010). Home quarantine was also shown to reduce the incidence of pandemic influenza A in the workplace (Miyaki et al., 2011). In fact, home quarantine has been used to control the community spread of SARS in Beijing, Taiwan, Singapore, and Toronto (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2003; Cava et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 2006).",

However, if it is technically and politically feasible, home quarantine may be extended for up to 21 days (one incubation period) for Ebola virus disease. However, public health staff is expected to face unprecedented challenges in implementing an extensive quarantine policy, as they have a dual role of monitoring compliance and providing support to people in quarantine. Countries in close proximity to the affected areas require implementing border control measures to screen for any suspected case of Ebola virus or even considering closing the border for 21 days.

Influenza vaccine is the most widely used annual vaccine in the community and health-care setting to protect at risk or any person to develop influenza-related complications and prevent institutional outbreaks. Seasonal influenza-related excess hospitalization and death were estimated to be 10 000 and 1100 per year, respectively, in Hong Kong, a subtropical city (Chiu et al., 2002; Wong et al., 2004, 2006). In a meta-analysis assessing influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in elderly patients, the inactivated influenza vaccine could reduce the risk of hospitalization as a result of pneumonia by 21\u201338%, and cardiovascular disease by 18\u201330%, and all cause of mortality by 39\u201356% (Nichol, 2008).",

Measles (incubation period of 7\u201318 days), mumps (incubation period of 12\u201325 days), rubella (incubation period of 14\u201323 days), and varicella (incubation period of 10\u201321 days) are relevant examples. Reactive vaccination for measles outbreak has been shown to be an effective measure to reduce the scale of outbreaks. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, weekly reported cases reduced respectively by 89.3% and 68.9% in the 3 weeks following mass vaccination campaigns (Alberti et al., 2010). Similarly, nationwide mass vaccination interrupted the transmission of paralytic poliomyelitis in Albania. In 1996, a total of 138 paralytic cases occurred with an attack rate of 10 per 100 000 population among adults aged 19\u201325 years. The epidemic was controlled by two rounds of mass vaccination with trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine targeted to persons aged 0\u201350 years (Prevots et al., 1998).",

The broad array of viruses worldwide causes substantial morbidity and mortality, ranging from respiratory viruses, arthropod-related viruses, to the most deadly blood-borne viruses. Novel emerging or reemerging viruses are causing major epidemics from time to time especially in densely populated areas where human populations have close contact with wild animals (wildlife markets) and food animals (wet markets and abattoirs). Such epidemics such as the Ebola virus disease can be explosive in countries with failed governance and poor health infrastructures. Currently, there is a lack of antiviral treatment for most of these infections. Therefore, prevention by implementing effective infection control and vaccination is of utmost importance to contain these viruses.",
