Given a set U of users, a set I of items and a set R of user ratings for items, we need to predict ratings for user-item pairs which are not in R. One of the main recommender system techniques is similarity-based Collaborative Filtering [1]. Such algorithms are based on a similarity function which takes into account user preferences and outputs a similarity degree between pairs of users. Another important approach in recommender systems is Dimensionality Reduction. Each user or item in the system is represented by a vector. A user\u2019s vector is the set of his ratings for all items in the system (even those that have not been rated by the specific user). The Matrix Factorization method [5] that characterizes both items and users by vectors of latent factors inferred from item rating patterns, is also a Dimensionality Reduction technique. High correlation between item and user factors leads to a recommendation.",

Other personalized methods use text queries [17]. They suffer, however, from the cold start problem, not being able to provide recommendations for users that are not in the training set. In addition, only a small number of examples per user are often available. This limits the class of possible methods to simple models that can be trained from a handful of examples [6]. More recent methods use a ranking formulation, where the goal is to score interesting video segments higher than non-interesting ones [4, 6, 14, 19] while combining audiovisual representation and user preferences. In [19], a novel pairwise deep ranking model is proposed that employs deep learning in order to learn the relationship between highlighted and non-highlighted video segments. A two-stream network structure is developed by representing video segments from complementary information on the appearance of video frames and temporal dynamics across frames for video highlight detection. Rather than training one model per user, the model proposed in [6] is personalized via its inputs, which allows to effectively adapt its predictions, given only a few user-specific examples. To train this model, a large-scale dataset of users and GIFs is created, providing an accurate indication of their interests. In this work, we use the same dataset and a ranking formulation.\n",
