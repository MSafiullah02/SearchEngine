            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in November 2002 led to infection in over 8000 individuals in 29 countries, and by August 2003 had resulted in 774 deaths worldwide. In Hong Kong 1755 individuals were diagnosed with SARS of whom 299 died. The agent causing SARS was found to be a RNA coronavirus (CoV), aptly named SARS-CoV [1], a member of coronaviridei which causes gastrointestinal, respiratory and systemic diseases in animals. Some members, OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HCoV-229E have long been known to cause common cold in human beings. SARS-CoV caused an influenza-like syndrome of malaise, rigors, fatigue and high fevers, which progressed to atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli. Respiratory insufficiency led to respiratory failure, which was the most common cause of death. The condition was empirically treated with a combination of antibacterial, antiviral and supra-physiological doses of glucocorticoids [2], [3]. Lymphopenia along with neutrophilia were common features in SARS patients [4], [5].",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a human paramyxovirus, is the most important cause of viral lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children world-wide. The disease too is characterized by lymphopenia (and neutrophilia), which is more severe in children admitted to intensive care unit [6], [7]. Lymphopenia (and neutrophilia) has also been reported in Ebola [8]. Thus there seems to be a connection between viral infections and lymphopenia, and the question is whether the viruses directly cause it. With regard to SARS, a review in Nature Reviews Immunology [9] highlighted a study of Gu et al. [10] as the one which \u201cindicates that SARS-CoV infection of lymphocytes is a crucial determinant of disease outcome\u201d. However of the 22 SARS patients whose white blood corpuscles were studied for SARS-CoV, the virus was detected in only six patients and in only 51.5% of the lymphocytes [10]. The prevalence rate of 27.3% statistically does not support the contention that SARS-CoV infection of lymphocytes determines the disease outcome, let alone cause lymphopenia as authors claimed. Moreover, whilst the SARS patients who had not received exogenous glucocorticoids exhibited lymphopenia, the lymphocyte count decreased further in patients who were given steroids [10]. This certainly suggests glucocorticoids had a role in the development of lymphopenia. The lymphopenia in the former group may just have been a prognosticator of the stress response, involving the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis [11]. An intact HPA axis is capable of secreting 225\u2013440 mg of cortisol under extreme stress, and achieving blood levels in the range 830\u20137220 nmol/L [12].",

In children with RSV infection, blood cortisol was significantly higher during the active phase (550\u2013650 nmol/L) than during convalescent phase (300 nmol/L) a few months later [13]. Cortisol ranged from 555 to 1110 nmol/L in seven asymptomatic patients with Ebola infection compared to 133\u2013377 nmol/L in 10 endemic control subjects [8]. In SARS, lymphopenia (and neutrophilia) was more prevalent in patients with higher prevailing cortisol, before any steroid therapy had been commenced [14], which probably reflected the integrity of HPA axis and stress response [11], [15]. However, the insidious presentation of SARS led to its empirical treatment with antibacterial, antiviral and supra-physiological doses of glucocorticoids [2], [3].

Around this time it was also shown that glucocorticoids changed the circulatory behaviour of lymphocytes, particularly T lymphocytes [17]. Glucocorticoids induced lymphopenia within 4 h of steroid administration [18]. Even under normal situation lymphocytes exhibited a pattern that was inversely correlated with the cortisol diurnal rhythm [19], a pattern that was absent in patients with adrenal insufficiency and duly restored with physiological doses of exogenous steroids [20]. In depressed patients who generally have hypercortisolaemia, lymphopenia and neutrophilia are common [21]. Although glucocorticoids acutely drive the T lymphocytes out of the peripheral circulation [22], they ultimately initiate apoptosis in these cells [23]. Intriguingly, while glucocorticoids cause apoptosis in lymphocytes, they inhibit the process in neutrophils [24], hence the probable reason for simultaneous occurrence of lymphopenia and neutrophilia.",

            "text": "Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of cytokines and chemokines in the aetiology and prognosis of SARS [25], [26], [27], [28]. Essentially all studies reported the up-regulation of same chemokines, namely macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). However, these studies were performed in SARS patients who were treated with glucocorticoids at supra-physiological doses, e.g., 0.1\u20131 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone. More severe patients with dyspnoea were further given intravenous infusions of 100 mg hydrocortisone every 8 h and 500 mg methylprednisolone (MP) pulses [3] (see [2] for other glucocorticoid dosage regimen). One study debated the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine and chemokine status in SARS patients subdivided into glucocorticoid \u201cnot treated\u201d or \u201ctreated\u201d groups with regard to pulsed steroid only, and claimed corticosteroid treatment lowered IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 concentrations after 5\u20138 days [25]. However the authors failed to mention that the \u201cnot treated\u201d patients had also received the initial steroid therapy. Zhang et al. [29] reported increased IL-6 and decreased IL-8 and TGF-\u03b2 in SARS patients, and further concluded that steroid treatment had no effect on the levels of eight cytokines in both less and more severe SARS patients. However, this conclusion was based on wrong statistical analysis used. Closer examination of their IL-6 data in untreated more severely sick SARS patients, presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, clearly was non-Gaussian, and yet the authors used a parametric unpaired \u201ct\u201d test for the statistical comparison between steroid treated and untreated SARS patients. Despite their erroneous conclusions, both less and more severely sick SARS patients treated with steroids had lower IL-6 levels. Another study which used corticosteroids primarily to dampen the local proinflammatory cytokine production believed to cause lung immunopathology [27], erroneously hypothesized up-regulation of chemokines in the SARS-CoV infected dendritic monocytes. It must be appreciated that systemically administered glucocorticoids do not just act locally, but have wider reach.",

The administration of 25 mg cortisone acetate (equivalent to the daily adrenal cortisol output) at 21 h that raised blood cortisol to 450\u2013676 nmol/L physiological range, promptly depressed all four cytokines within an hour, followed by a decrease in CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ lymphocytes by 2\u20133 h [19]. Given that physiological levels of cortisol had such profound effect in down-regulating the proinflammatory cytokines (and affecting the trafficking of lymphocytes), it is not difficult to envisage the effects of supra-physiological doses of exogenous glucocorticoids on lymphokine production.",

Jiang et al. while promulgating the elevations of proinflammatory IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 as the sign of superinfection and increased risk of death in SARS [26], overlooked the fact that patients in their study, with or without secondary infections had received 162.5 \u00b1 116.3 or 105.8 \u00b1 78.7 mg MP per day, respectively. MP is five times more potent than cortisol and would have left the patients immunocompromised, vulnerable to secondary infections. The same treatment should also have down-regulated the proinflammatory cytokines [19], [30], [31], but mysteriously did not. Lymphokines can be produced by any nucleated cell in the body [34], and moreover the dogma confining their production to any particular immune cell, e.g., Th1 vs. Th2 has been challenged [35].",

Cortisol would have caused lymphocytes to migrate out of the peripheral circulation initially, and later caused their demise via apoptosis. However, the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids complicated the whole issue regarding the cause of lymphopenia (and neutrophilia) in SARS. But all indications are that glucocorticoids, whether endogenous or exogenous were the main arbiters of lymphopenia (and neutrophilia). Secondly, in a setting where the immune system must have been severely compromised by exogenous glucocorticoids, the up- and down-regulation of various lymphokines and their prognostic implications for SARS, should be interpreted with caution [36].",
