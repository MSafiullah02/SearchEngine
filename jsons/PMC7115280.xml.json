Physiologic and subjective data were analyzed using 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance to determine the main effect of the FFRs (3 conditions) over time (4 time points over 1 hour), with the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for the violation of sphericity.

However, of subjects passing the pre-exercise fit test, a significant number failed on the postexercise test with the N95 FFR, but not with the P100 FFR (Table 2). Facial sweat has been reported to interfere with the fit of some respirators,3 and all subjects in the current study were observed to be sweating profusely during the 1 hour of exercise in the hot, humid environment. The impact of the hot, humid ambient environment is further supported by the significantly higher retained moisture of both respirators compared with that previously reported for the N95 FFR over 1 hour at a similar work rate in temperate ambient conditions.15, 16 In addition to possible effects on face seal and breathing resistance, significant moisture retention in nonrigid protective facemasks can lead to facemask collapse on inspiration that impedes breathing; therefore, rigid FFRs, such as the P100, may retain their shape better in hot, humid conditions of prolonged FFR wear.17, 18 It may be that the better postexercise fit factor performance of the P100 FFR was, at least in part, related to its inner gasket-like flange (face seal) (Table 1, Fig 1D), which offers a larger sealing surface area than that of the N95 FFR.19 The adjustable straps of the P100 FFR (Table 1) might also offer an advantage of tailoring the face seal pressure to compensate for the variability in facial anthropometrics among respirator users and thereby may enhance fit. The 2 individuals who failed the initial fit testing with the N95 FFR and the 1 individual who barely passed (FF = 107) are the same 3 individuals who also failed the initial fit testing with the P100 FFR (Table 2), suggesting that they shared some common features that impact fit (anthropometrics, etc). Of further (but possibly related) note, the 2 respirator models studied are available commercially only in 1 size (that is expected to fit most, but not all, faces) rather than the multiple sizes offered for most FFRs (ie, small, medium, medium-large, large) to accommodate recognized differences in facial sizes. Having a 1-size FFR model that fits most users well offers certain commercial and logistical advantages, but the fact that it cannot fit all users in a given respirator protection program is an important consideration.",

            "text": "There were no significant differences between controls and FFRs with respect to measured physiologic variables, save for the temperature of the facial skin under the respirator, a finding that was not unexpected because of the FFR barrier effects on facial skin heat dissipation (eg, convection, radiation, evaporation) that has been previously reported with N95 FFR use.20 The findings of no significant differences between controls and FFRs with respect to overall skin temperature, rectal temperature, and thermal perceptions indicate that the use of FFRs in hot, humid environments does not add to the body's thermophysiologic or perceptual burdens. The lack of significant physiologic impact of N95 FFR use compared with controls was also not unexpected because comparable findings have been previously reported with N95 FFRs having similar filter resistances.15, 16 This is the result of decreased breathing resistance that is the result of the incorporation of electrostatic charges into the filter that allows for improved particle capture without increasing filter density. This is also related to the fact that workload intensity (low to moderate in the current study) has a greater impact physiologically (eg, HR, RR) than the magnitude of inspiratory resistance.9 The lack of significant difference between the 2 FFR models with respect to measured physiologic variables was, however, somewhat unanticipated given the roughly 3-fold difference in filter resistance of the P100 FFR (Table 1). The similarity in the RR between the 2 FFRs and controls suggests that the FFR filter resistances were compensated for by an increase in the respective respiratory duty cycles (the portion of the respiratory cycle spent in inhalation), a feature that may be imperceptible to the FFR wearer at the study's low to moderate work rate.21 Therefore, the significant subjective perception of increased breathing discomfort with either FFR compared with controls may have been related to other issues, such as the significantly greater facial skin heat, associated respirator microenvironment (respirator dead space) moisture and heat, or temperature of the inhaled air (determined by the composite of the temperature of the entrained ambient air and respirator dead space air temperature). The finding of no significant beneficial impact on study variables attributable to the exhalation valve of the P100 FFR has previously been reported for N95 FFR use over 1 and 2 hours, at the same work rate as the current study, and attributed to the lack of development of the streamlined airflows required for exhalation valve activation at low to moderate work rates.22, 23 The lack of significant difference in the increased temperature of the facial skin covered by either of the FFRs further supports that the P100 exhalation valve was likely not sufficiently activated.23 The impact of an exhalation valve could be evaluated through the use of an infrared camera to determine surface temperatures of different models of FFRs (with and without an exhalation valve) at similar work rates.24 The absence of significant differences in thermal perceptions between controls and FFRs suggests that global skin temperature in a hot, humid environment is the major contributor to perceptions of thermal discomfort rather than the FFR itself.",

We only tested subjects for 1 hour of exercise at a low to moderate work rate and cannot comment on findings with more prolonged FFR use or higher work rates. Only 1 model each of the N95 FFR and P100 FFR from a single manufacturer was tested, and we cannot comment on other FFR classes (eg, P99 FFR, N99 FFR), models (eg, cup shaped, duck bill, pleated), other exhalation valve-equipped models, or FFRs from different manufacturers. Although the tested N95 FFR and P100 FFR were of different design styles (flat fold and cup-shaped, respectively), prior investigations comparing flat-fold and cup-shaped N95 FFRs have reported no statistically significant differences in fit factors between designs.19, 25 It may be that anthropometric features, selecting the appropriate respirator size, and certain respirator features (eg, adjustable straps) are more important to respirator fit than respirator style.25 Some of the subjects who failed a fit test (ie, score <100) nonetheless still attained a score (\u226510) that correlated with the OSHA-assigned protection factor of 10 for FFRs (the workplace level of respiratory protection that a respirator or class of respirators is expected to provide to employees when the employer implements a continuing, effective respiratory protection program as specified by the OSHA).",

            "text": "A P100 FFR had a significantly greater proportion of passing scores on respirator quantitative fit testing after 1 hour of treadmill exercise at a low to moderate work rate in a hot, humid environment without significant difference in measurable physiologic stress compared with an N95 FFR. The adjustable straps that permit tailoring of face seal pressure to compensate for variability in facial dimensions, and the inner flange on the P100 FFR that allows for a greater sealing surface to the face when compared with the study N95 FFR model, may serve to maintain an acceptable fit in environments associated with increased facial moisture. At low to moderate work rates, exhalation valves on FFRs may not be activated. Wearing a FFR in hot, humid environments at low to moderate work rates does not add to the body's thermophysiologic or perceptual burdens. In hot, humid environments where respiratory protection is mandated, the use of P100 FFRs may offer some advantages over N95 FFRs in maintaining FFR fit without any additional physiologic burden over 1 hour of use at low to moderate work rates, while simultaneously offering a higher level of filtration.",
