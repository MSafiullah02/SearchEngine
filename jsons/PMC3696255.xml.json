Improvements in infection detection, antimicrobial therapy and evidence-based practices of prevention have played a big role in reducing the scourge. Some infections are eliminated, some are under control, some new ones are emerging and some are re-emerging. Some hitherto \u2018innocuous\u2019 microbes have started acquiring \u2018infectivity\u2019. Being intimately associated with patient care in the operating theatre and critical care units, the anaesthesiologist is always at risk of contamination. He has to keep himself abreast of the developments related to infectious diseases.",

Of the routine infections, more than 90% of the percutaneous infections occur in healthcare workers (HCWs) in developing countries.[2] There have been five documented cases of HIV infection after occupational exposure in the UK (as of November 2008) as per the Health Protection Agency (HPA) report.[3] Effective strategies for protection of HCWs against these infections are available such as universal precautions, immunisation against hepatitis B and influenza, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) and post-exposure management.[24]",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first detected in southern China in late 2002 and later in South-East Asia and subsequently killed more than 770 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide, including HCWs who got infected during patient care. Ventilatory care was needed for associated pneumonia and respiratory failure. Recent reports in the media of outbreaks of influenza A (H7N9) bird flu virus in China and possibly, the first human deaths have caught the attention of healthcare professionals world-wide once again. No vaccine is currently available for human use against this infection.",

Anthrax has been used for terrorist attacks and anthrax dissemination by post has been a concern.

Specific antibiotics can cure the disease and the typical black scars can help in diagnosis, but high index of suspicion needs to be maintained and diagnosis confirmed by laboratory tests. Only some tertiary centres undertake Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (test of choice) apart from Weil Felix test. Involvement of the central nervous system is increasingly seen in scrub typhus with neck stiffness, neurologic weakness, seizures, delirium and coma; anaesthesiologists have a major role in neurological and cardio respiratory support to reduce the risk of death.",
