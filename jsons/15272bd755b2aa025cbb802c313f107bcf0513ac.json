Several structural features of this protein are known to be important for its fusion activity. A stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the amino terminus of the F 1 subunit, termed the 'fusion peptide', is considered to be responsible for insertion into the host cell membrane to initiate the fusion process [5, 11, 12] . In addition, 2 heptad repeat regions (i.e. HRA and HRB) in the F 1 polypeptide are believed to have important roles in membrane fusion. HRA is located at the carboxyl terminal of the fusion peptide, and HRB is located immediately upstream of the transmembrane region. Upon triggering, these 2 domains undergo conformational changes to form a stable 6stranded coil that pulls the viral and target cell membranes together [9, 12, 13] .",

To investigate the effect of this domain on fusion activity, point mutations were introduced by using site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the heptadic residues at amino acids 257, 264, 271, 278, 285, 292, and 299 in this motif with an alanine residue. Additionally, 3 highly conserved middle heptadic leucine residues (i.e. L271, L278, and L285) were replaced with alanine in various combinations. The effects on the fusion activity, cell surface expression, and HN-F interactions of such mutated F proteins were examined. Our data showed that all of the mutants, whether individually or in combination, caused no reductions in the cell surface expression levels of F, but they led to a decreased fusogenic activity in all steps of membrane fusion. Thus, it seems that the defective fusogenic activity of these mutated F proteins is related to decreased HN-F interactions at the cell surface.",

Identification of colonies carrying the mutated F genes was facilitated by screening for the presence of 2 unique restriction sites (i.e. the KPN I site and the Not I site). Finally, mutated F protein genes were sequenced in their entirety to verify the desired mutation(s) and that no other changes in the F protein were present. The other single mutants were obtained with the same procedures. Double and triple mutants were made by sequential mutagenesis on previously mutagenized templates.

Quantification of syncytia, expressed as a percentage of those detected in cells coexpressing wt F and HN proteins, is shown in figure 2 b.

As shown in figure 5 a, when cells individually expressing pBSK + or the hPIV-3 F protein were mixed with R18-labeled RBC, no fluorescence dequenching was detected (blue curve or purple curve; colors refer to the online version only); however, with cells coexpressing wt F and its homologous HN proteins, fluorescence dequenching rapidly and significantly increased (red curve; color refers to the online version only).

Our results indicated that amino acid residues L257 and I299, which are positioned at either end of the leucine zipper-like domain, displayed an extremely exhausted fusion activity in all stages of the fusion process when they were replaced by alanine. One nonexclusive possibility is that L257 and I299 are not only key residues in stabilizing the structure of this motif but they are also involved in fusion. While V264A and Q292A mutants both retained about 85% of the fusion activity compared with the wt F protein, it appears that the 2 residues were much more tolerant of alanine substitution than the ones located at either end of this motif without significantly affecting its fusogenicity. As shown in figure 8 , comparison of the primary amino acid sequence of the leucine zipper-like motifs of different paramyxovirus F proteins suggested that the 3 middle heptadic leucine residues were highly conserved. Analysis of these 3 heptadic leucines, which were replaced individually or in combination by alanine, revealed that single substitution was able to diminish the fusion activity of the protein, while replacement in combination could further reduce or even abrogate fusion activity. These data are in agreement with the results from the mutational analysis of the leucine zipper domain of the murine coronavirus spike (S) protein; substitution of at least 2 heptadic leucine residues is necessary to abrogate fusion activity [35] . Since these mutants exhibited similar levels of cell surface expression with respect to the wt F protein, the lack of their fusion activity could not be accounted for by an insufficient amount of F proteins available on the cell surface.",

Six of the mutated F proteins (L257A, L271A, I299A, L271A-L278A, L271A-L285A, and L278A-L285A), which nearly lost their ability to form syncytia, directed less than 16.0% of the levels of pore formation of the wt F protein and exhibited a hemifusion activity almost similar to the negative control level, with the rate and extent of initial fusion below 9.5% of the wt F level. The minimal levels of hemifusion, the low levels of pore formation, and the almost negative control levels of syncytium formation detected with these mutants suggest that the low levels of syncytium formation were likely due to slow fusion kinetics being unable to efficiently support pore expansion.",

            "text": "In most paramyxovirus systems, including hPIV-3, membrane fusion requires HN and F proteins derived from homologous viruses [39] , which suggests that there is a virus-specific interaction between the 2 membrane glycoproteins that is crucial for the induction of cell fusion [5] . Upon attachment of the HN protein to its sialic acid receptor, the HN protein undergoes a conformational change that stimulates the associated F protein refolding into its postfusion conformation. Our study shows that all of the mutations in the leucine zipper-like motif of the hPIV-3 F protein not only diminished or even abrogated fusion activity but also reduced the amount of HN-F complexes. There seems to be a correlation between fusion deficiency and the decreased ability of F to interact with HN. This result seems to be in line with the findings of Melanson and Iorio [40] . Thus, the most reasonable explanation for the defective fusion activity is that these mutant F proteins failed to form a sufficient amount of functional complexes containing the hPIV-3 HN protein, thereby blocking signal transmission between the HN and F proteins. These signals are presumably involved in modulation of the membrane fusion pro-cess. It has been reported that the domains M1, M2, and B of the PIV5 F protein and the M1 region of the PIV2 F protein are involved in the HN-F interaction [41, 42] ; the corresponding region of this motif of the hPIV-3 F protein in the PIV5 and PIV2 F proteins was identified as being included in these domains by amino acid sequence alignment. Our present findings thus do not exclude the possibility that this motif per se was the constituent of its specific interaction domains with HN.",

The mutants formed by replacing the 3 highly conserved middle heptadic leucine residues (L271, L278, and L285) in combination, and 2 single mutants (L257A and I299A) at the end of the motif drastically diminished or even abrogated fusogenic activity. Based on these findings, we propose that the leucine zipper-like motif of the hPIV-3 F glycoprotein has an important effect on its fusion activity, and the integrality of this motif is indispensable for membrane fusion. Studying the influence of this motif of the hPIV-3 F protein on fusion activity could provide clues to develop antiviral vaccines and therapeutic drugs to prevent and cure paramyxovirus infection.",
