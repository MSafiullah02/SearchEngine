While the leading web search engines support the retrieval of plain facts often fairly well, hardly any support is currently provided for the retrieval of argumentative text, let alone the retrieval and ranking of individual arguments. This is particularly unfortunate in today\u2019s political and corresponding societal discourse, where well-reasoned argumentation on all kinds of controversial topics is of utmost importance. Yet, especially search results on such topics are often riddled with populism, conspiracy theories, and one-sidedness. This is not to say that these are not valid argumentative techniques, but rather that they arguably do not lead to the kind of information and insights one wants to support. Also at the personal level, users are very interested in (and often search for) the most relevant arguments that speak for or against a possible decision.",

Participants then submit their ranked retrieval results for each topic to be judged. Participating teams will be able to submit up to three runs with different approaches to be evaluated by expert assessors. We will make all the runs from this year\u2019s task available to the community\u2014to have a basis for training models in light of a potential second edition of the lab as well as to enable reproducibility and independent research.",

Multiple online portals are centered around exactly such topics, such as Yahoo! Answers or Quora. Surprisingly, however, search engines nowadays do not provide any effective way to retrieve reliable arguments from these platforms, even though the search engines provide snippets for direct answers to factoid questions, among others. Presumably, the main reason is that search engines often do not grasp the argumentative nature of the underlying information need.",

In particular, the goal of the task is to find relevant arguments when comparing several objects with different options (e.g., \u201cIs X better than Y for Z?\u201d). Evidently, comparative information needs seem to be important: Question answering platforms such as Quora are filled with topics such as \u201cHow Python compares to PHP for web development?3\u201d or \u201cIs Germany better to live in compared to US?4\u201d. Still, in their current form, search engines such as Google and DuckDuckGo5 do not provide much support for such comparative queries besides the \u201cten blue links\u201d. Retrieval of comparative information is thus eminent in web search and, according to [1], appears in about 10% of all search sessions. The retrieval topics for this task are based on real-world comparative questions that were submitted to commercial search engines and posted to question answering platforms.",

Furthermore, TARGER\u2019s API can also be used to identify argumentative units in free text input. Additionally, we provide a baseline argument retrieval approach proposed by [3], which integrates the TARGER\u2019s API to capture \u201cargumentativeness\u201d in text documents.

Participants of respective ad-hoc setups from previous years at TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR can participate with ease, either with their favorite system, or enriched with a pipeline taking argumentativeness into account. The second task will be centered around information needs expressed as questions, which is attractive to participants from previous question-oriented tracks/labs. Both subtasks ultimately aim to support the building of (retrieval) systems that can discuss and argue with human users. Hence, also the rapidly growing community around conversational search, with successful workshops at the recent SIGIR, WWW, IJCAI, and EMNLP (CAIR and SCAI), might be interested.",

We suggest to integrate a notion of a \u201cstrong\u201d argumentation, or argument quality, into a retrieval pipeline by exploiting definite metrics such as level of support, credibility, cogency, style, and contribution to a stance. Our lab is aimed at inducing a discussion and developing computational approaches to the underlying aspects of the argument retrieval from an application-driven perspective.",
