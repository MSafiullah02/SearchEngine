It is regulated by infant immunity, which in turn develops and is shaped by exposure to the microbiota3,4. Intestinal lymphoid tissues require the intestinal microbiota for normal development, and exposure to commensal and pathogenic organisms sets the tone of the systemic and mucosal immune system for the long term. These early interactions have a substantial impact on the development of metabolic and immune-mediated disorders5. There is also emerging evidence in mice and humans for microbiota dependent modeling of local immunity and the subsequent response to infection or vaccination6\u20138. Understanding the complex interaction between the microbiota and immune responses during infancy therefore has potentially important implications for vaccine development as well as prevention of immune-mediated disorders.",

Oral vaccines against poliovirus, rotavirus, and cholera are all substantially less immunogenic and effective when given to children in LMICs17. This phenomenon has prolonged polio eradication by limiting vaccine effectiveness18, and is limiting the benefits from the global scale-up in access to oral rotavirus vaccines19. However, recent studies of biomarkers of EE in children at the time of immunization have had mixed findings, with different biomarkers showing positive, negative or no association with oral poliovirus or rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity20. Several other mechanisms may also contribute to poor oral vaccine immunogenicity in LMICs, including interference by high titers of antigen-specific transplacental or breastmilk antibodies. However, withholding breastfeeding does not improve oral poliovirus or rotavirus vaccine response21\u201324, and neonatal immunization when transplacental antibody titres are at their highest has in general resulted in comparable levels of seroconversion to doses administered later in life25,26.",

We measured systemic and mucosal immune parameters in peripheral blood and stool samples collected at the time of monovalent serotype 3 OPV immunization of seronegative Indian infants aged 6\u201311 months. These infants were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on EE and OPV immunogenicity31. As primary outcome, we reported that azithromycin treatment had no effect on seroconversion after OPV, despite reducing the enteric bacterial pathogen load and fecal biomarkers of EE. Instead, infection with enteric viruses (enteroviruses and rotavirus) was associated with seroconversion. We now report on extensive immune profiling of these infants at the time of immunization, including mucosal homing immune cells in peripheral blood, plasma cytokines and acute-phase proteins, leukocyte counts, and fecal biomarkers of inflammation. We use a statistical learning approach to identify immune markers measured at the time of vaccination that predict OPV immunogenicity. We end with a consideration of the implications of our findings for improving oral vaccines and oral vaccination strategies.",

Combining all measurements in a machine-learning (random forests) analysis, OPV seroconversion could be predicted with an out-of-sample accuracy of 58% (IQR: 50\u201369%), only a modest improvement over the 50% accuracy expected by chance. Apart from enterovirus infection, the variables with the highest importance in this analysis were the numbers of CD4+ T cells homing to the small intestine (CCR9+), particularly CD4+FOXP3+ (regulatory) T cells, and also circulating leukocytes, in particular neutrophils, and the fecal biomarker of enteropathy \u03b11-antitrypsin. This is potentially suggestive of a local intestinal inflammation that inhibits OPV immunogenicity. CD4+ regulatory T cells have a well-established role in intestinal inflammation\u2014they home towards the inflamed gut and can resolve intestinal inflammation32. They are also involved in the early antiviral immune response to mucosal infection in mice33,34.

It will be important to determine how our findings in this population translate to other settings, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, where oral vaccine immunogenicity is also compromised. We deliberately enrolled infants without detectable serum neutralizing antibodies to serotype 3 poliovirus, but these infants were previously exposed to trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine and may have developed an immune response that was not detectable in blood or that had waned by the time of enrollment. It is therefore possible that our population included both na\u00efve and immunologically primed infants with a potential impact on the subsequent immunogenicity of OPV. However, we were not able to distinguish such a population and analysis of infant vaccination history and seroprevalence at screening for eligibility was consistent with a simple hypothesis of a small, independent probability of vaccine failure per dose of earlier vaccine40.",

Infection with enteric viruses and changes in gut-homing regulatory T cells showed a modest association with OPV immunogenicity. Further work would be required to investigate this possible association, ideally including mucosal samples. It is clear that intestinal homeostasis among these infants is skewed towards an inflammatory state that maintains health in the presence of multiple intestinal pathogens. On average, each infant had >2 pathogen targets detected in stool using TAC but only 2% had diarrhea at enrollment31. We do not fully understand the mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of this inflammatory environment, although they are likely to reflect the integration by the infant immune system of multiple signals from intestinal viral and bacterial pathogens and commensals3,41. Further investigation of these mechanisms in humans and in animal models may identify pathways that could be targeted by coadministered drugs or adjuvants that enhance the immune response to oral vaccines.",

The dashed line indicates expected accuracy if a random choice were made. The top eight most important variables that predict c seroconversion and d study arm in one best fit full random forests model are shown as correlation networks. The color of the circle around each variable indicate whether they were positively (green) or negatively (red) associated with seroconversion or azithromycin respectively. The size of each network node indicates the strength of correlation with the outcome and the color indicates whether the variable describes pathogens in stool (orange), EE biomarkers (blue) ex vivo T-cell and total leukocyte count data (pink), or plasma cytokines (green) (as for a and b). Demographic variables were not among the top eight variables.
