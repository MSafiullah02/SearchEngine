The history, laboratory data, and outcome measures were extracted from patients' medical records, using an structured abstraction tool. All vital signs and lab data were collected at presentation. \"GI manifestation\" was defined as presence of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Patients were considered to have indication of liver injury at presentation if they had elevated ALT, AST, total bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase. The primary clinical outcome for admitted patients was defined as a composite of ICU admission or death (details of methods is available in supplementary material).",

One potential explanation for the high rate of diarrhea seen may be related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus's high affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and the abundant ACE2 expression on colonic and ileal epithelial cells 1 . Prior studies, suggest that the presence and severity of digestive symptoms on initial presentation was correlated with worsening disease severity 2 . In contrast, we observed a trend for the presence of GI symptoms on initial presentation to be associated with less severe disease in univariable analysis (Supplementary table 1) , and no significant effect in multivariable analysis. This might be due to higher admission rates in patients with relatively mild respiratory involvement but significant GI symptoms.",

The presence of liver injury on presentation, however, was associated with a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and death. High prevalence of liver injury in COVID-19 may be due to direct viral infection of liver cells 4 . However, the pathology of hepatic injury in COVID-19 is likely multi-factorial, and may include an indirect reflection of the systemic inflammatory response resulting in compromised vascular hemodynamics and immune hyperactivity and cytokine activation [5] [6] [7] .",
