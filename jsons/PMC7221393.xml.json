This can dramatically increase exposure to COVID-19 as the virus can remain airborne viable for longer than three hours.5\n,\n6 These compounding risks justify the need to establish clear protocols for physicians performing any nasal procedure.",

As of March 18, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has limited \u201call non-essential planned surgeries and procedures, including dental, until further notice\u201d. Only procedures/surgeries in a high acuity situations or in unstable patients should continue.8 Some providers have already modified their use of nasopharyngoscopy in perioperative evaluation of patients undergoing endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.9 Based on the surgeon general's advice, all elective procedures should be currently halted. Endoscopy at this point should only be considered for emergent/urgent cases, which in the case of endoscopy is likely limited to a very select number of tumor cases and possibly severe refractory epistaxis. Even with these cases, providers should consider utilizing imaging modalities (CT, MRI, CTA) for diagnostic purposes and reserve endoscopy for critical situations where it will have a significant impact on management.",

The above recommendations are also followed for inpatient settings, with the addition of the placement of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) for those in the OR as N95s may not be sufficient.12 This procedure is supported by guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention13 and healthcare agencies in China as the usage of PAPRs may help control viral dissemination.11\n,\n12 Lastly, some institutions have postponed elective surgeries in cases where patients tested positive for COVID-19 in the 48 hours prior. These institutions are requiring patients to retest with a negative result before proceeding with the operation.12\n",

Only vital personnel should remain in the room if performing any nasal endoscopic procedure as this will both reduce exposure and conserve vital personal protective equipment. Three levels of protection are recommended for the person performing the procedure: gown, N95 mask, and face shield. PAPR should be used in place of an N95 if available. Use nasal pled gets in place of aerosol decongestants and anesthetics. In addition, COVID-19 testing prior to emergent surgeries should be performed, with the expectation that the procedures for patients who test positive will be postponed. Finally, just as in office visits,all non-essential personnel should be limited during any emergent ENT surgeries.",
