Health systems around the globe are struggling to find efficacious treatments against COVID-19 and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Previous experience with SARS and MERS-CoV infection demonstrated a marked pro-inflammatory response (Th1 and Th17) in patients with ARDS which is also seen in COVID-19 [1], [2], [3]. This evidence has prompted the off-label use of IL-6 inhibitors in severe COVID-19 disease as well as the initiation of randomised clinical trials to test these drugs (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04320615). Additionally, other inflammatory cytokine pathways such as the IL-1 pathway are currently being explored (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04324021). Hydroxychloroquine, a commonly used antirheumatic medication, has been shown to have in vitro protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection [4], although its clinical efficacy still needs to be adequately assessed via randomized clinical trials [5]. A recently approved RA drug, JAK1/2 inhibitor baricitinib, could also be protective by reducing the ability of the virus to infect lung cells [6]. Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide an opportunity to rapidly learn the impact of immunosuppressive agents as protective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against the development of more severe outcomes in COVID-19 disease.",

            "text": "Targeted biological and synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) could also have a detrimental effect in COVID-19 disease. There is a major need in the rheumatological community to determine which, if any, tDMARDs increase the vulnerability to infection and should therefore be stopped. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), American College of Rheumatology (ACR), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) have published preliminary guidance in this scenario [7], [8], [9], [10]. EULAR and PRES suggest that patients should discuss treatment discontinuation with their rheumatologists. ACR recommendations also favour to temporarily stop treatment with tDMARDs if exposure to SARS-CoV-2. NICE and ACR advocate the suspension of tDMARDs if COVID-19 is confirmed or suspected with the ACR considering IL-6 inhibitors an exception, which may be continued under specific circumstances. So far, these recommendations are based on expert opinion as there is yet very limited epidemiological evidence on the potential risk conferred by tDMARDs with regards to severe COVID-19 disease complications in patients with rheumatic diseases. Recent reports from Italy show no evidence of increased risk in a cohort of 320 adult rheumatic patients and in a cohort of 123 patients with connective tissue diseases [11, 12]. To date, only one report from a paediatric centre in Milan (Italy) shows no confirmed COVID-19 cases in children [13]. With this scant evidence, rheumatologists worldwide are in the dark as to how to manage patients on immunosuppressive therapies during the pandemic and more information is urgently needed [14]. Different initiatives are being established worldwide to attempt to resolve this issue. Among them, the best positioned to lead this objective is the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance, an international coalition that is collecting data on rheumatic patients affected with COVID19. At present, however, they have published an initial report of only 110 rheumatic patients with COVID-19 disease outlining their characteristics and comorbidities [15]. The aim of our study was to report the incidence of COVID-19 in a large cohort of adult and a cohort of paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases receiving tDMARDs from a reference tertiary hospital in Spain, and to explore the possible effect of these treatments in the expression of COVID-19.",

People receiving immunosuppressant therapies are considered more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections and, consequently, a major concern for rheumatologists worldwide is to know if rheumatic patients receiving these therapies have an increased risk of COVID-19. In this study, we performed an epidemiological survey of the COVID-19 incidence in rheumatic patients receiving tDMARD therapy from a large tertiary hospital from Barcelona, Spain. From a total of 959 IMID patients treated with tDMARDs, we identified 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases in adults and no cases in the paediatric population. When comparing our cohort to the epidemiological data from the same city districts and tested with the same criteria, we found that the cumulative incidence for rheumatic patients is highly similar to that of the general population. In our patient cohort, 10% of patients had COVID-19 compatible symptoms according to the WHO criteria. Analysing the tDMARD distribution in these at-risk cases, we found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases.

The number of confirmed cases in our cohort is comparable to that recently reported from one of the focal regions in Italy (1.2% vs. 1.2%) [11]. If considering all cases, the adjusted incidence rate appears to be higher in our patients compared to the general population (1.21% vs 0.58%). However, these results need to be contextualised. Following hospital and regional health guidance [16], SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation should be only performed in patients with pneumonia and hospital admission requirements. In our cohort, however, 5 additional patients with normal chest x-ray and without inpatient admission criteria were PCR-tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. These patients were health workers from the same hospital (n=2) or patients who were tested as considered to be vulnerable population by the treating clinician (n=3). Once these subjects are excluded from the analysis, the incidence rate is analogous to the population from the same city area. Reassuringly, tDMARD-treated inflammatory rheumatic disease patients do not seem to present a more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19, although our sample of confirmed cases is small. All of the confirmed cases had a complete recovery and only one required admittance in the intensive care unit. Of relevance, there were no confirmed cases in our paediatric cohort as shown in a previous report from Italy [13]. This result is in concordance with the low occurrence of COVID-19 reported for children from the general population [19].",

In our rheumatology department, tDMARD treatment discontinuation was performed individually, based on the specific patient characteristics. Of note, in most of the confirmed cases that were not admitted (i.e. normal chest x-ray), treatment was not stopped and all patients completely recovered from the infection. This is in line with the recently published guidelines of the German Society of Rheumatology that in a situation of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR without signs of infection, only recommend a tDMARD pause or delay for 5-6 days [20].

This situation clearly hinders the estimation of the true population incidence. In our study, to better explore the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of the suspected cases we decided to identify which patients had compatible symptoms based on the current WHO guidance [17]. The most frequent symptoms in both confirmed and suspected cases were fever and persistent cough as outlined in a recent meta-analysis [22]. Patients with compatible symptoms were significantly younger in the adult population. Factors that could contribute to this increase could be that younger patients tend to live with a higher number of cohabitants and are more likely to leave home for work and, therefore, have an increased risk of infection exposure. We found no differences in comorbidities between groups. This is in apparent contradiction to data suggesting that comorbidities have an important role in COVID-19 severity [23]. However, it is possible that comorbidities influence the severity of the disease rather than the probability of infection [24]. Finally, in our cohort active RA patients were more likely to be classified as suspected cases. There is evidence that RA patients are at an increased risk of infections particularly if they present high disease activity and depending on the concomitant glucocorticoids dose [25], [26], [27]. Also, when exploring the characteristics of these active patients, we found they were older, more obese and had more diabetes suggesting an effect of comorbidity in this finding [28].",

CTLA4-Ig and anti-IL-6 treated patients were less likely to be classified as suspected cases. When restricting the analysis to RA patients, we found suspected cases being less treated with abatacept or IL-6 inhibitors, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. This data suggests a protective effect of these two therapies. IL-6 is one of the cytokines more highly expressed in severe forms of COVID-19, and has been associated to the reported cytokine storms [29]. For this reason, IL-6 inhibitors are currently being used in the treatment of severe COVID disease [30]. Our results are in line with a possible protective role of IL-6 inhibition in the progression of disease severity and suggest this could be applied preventively, at earlier stages of the infection [31]. There is preliminary evidence that inhibition of the CD80/86 co-stimulation by abatacept as well as IL-6 inhibition could be useful to treat interstitial lung disease [32, 33]. Moreover, abatacept has been associated with a lower risk of serious infections which adds up as a possible explanation of these findings [34]. Very recently, a case series of 86 COVID-19 affected patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) from New York showed that the percentage of patients treated with tDMARDs (72% of the cohort) was higher in the ambulatory managed patients compared to those that required admission[15]. Despite the small sample size, this study is in line with our findings, supporting the observation that some tDMARDs might have a protective effect. Together, these data should encourage the initiation of well-designed randomised controlled trials to corroborate the protective effect of these treatments in COVID-19.",

            "text": "Some limitations of this study need to be addressed. First, we designed an observational study based on a telephone survey with different date completion and filled by distinct operators. Patient reporting could have been influenced by the operator and symptoms could have been missed as these could have appeared after the date of completion. To address this potential bias, we reviewed the electronic health records of all patients to detect possible cases and asked all our patients to actively contact us if any of the compatible symptoms occurred. Secondly, we only included rheumatic patients treated with tDMARDs without a control group, either treated with other type of DMARDs or untreated patients. While including also rheumatic patients without these therapies would have also been useful information, the exceptional workload during the lockdown period compelled us to prioritise the group of patients who were initially considered to be the most vulnerable. Thirdly, our study is mainly focused on chronic inflammatory arthritis and we did not include, for example, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or giant cell arteritis that could provide additional insights into the protective effect of hydroxychloroquine and anti-IL6 therapies. Further, the lockdown effect might be more pronounced in IMID patients since they are considered an immunosuppressed cohort protecting them from possible exposure to infection and, therefore, distorting their comparison with general population. With regards to the analysis, the small number of cases did not allow for the adjustment for potential confounders other than age and sex. Lastly, due to limited availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing in our setting, the estimate of COVID-19 incidence is inaccurate, thereby prompting the health community to rely on suspect cases definitions that might not precisely identify all cases.",

            "text": "In conclusion, adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome compared to the general population. These data suggest that tDMARDs should not be stopped in these patients during the pandemic. Our study also suggests that tDMARDs show different levels of protection against COVID-19 and supports the development of randomized clinical trials to adequately assess their individual effect. International initiatives currently under way, such as the Global Rheumatology Alliance and the EULAR COVID-19 database will provide invaluable data for rheumatic disease management, but epidemiological studies from large national reference centres can be extremely helpful as an interim guidance [14, 35]. In this unprecedented time, when therapies commonly used in rheumatic diseases could prove useful to manage a pandemic disease, rheumatologists are required to provide all their expertise to accelerate the generation of scientific data to protect the lives of people, not only those affected by rheumatic diseases, but also for the global population.",
