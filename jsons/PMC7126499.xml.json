Betula alleghaniensis, Betula lenta and Betula papyrifera are also valuable for forest industry. Birches are cold tolerant pioneer species and in southern Europe they are found mainly on higher altitudes. Many Betula species such as Betula nana L. (dwarf birch), Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii (Orlova) H\u00e4met-Ahti (arctic moor birch) and Betula utilis D. Don (Himalayan birch) are typical for treeline. Betula nana and its subspecies are shrubs native to arctic and cool temperate regions of northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America. They are also present in Greenland as well as in mountains in Scotland and the Alps. Betula utilis is growing as a shrub or tree native to the Himalayas (Ha\u00a8met-Ahti et al., 1989, http://www.discoverlife.org,).",

The former have been based mainly on morphological characteristics of birch leaves and fruits (reviewed in Atkinson (1992)), and the latter on the composition of phenolics (particularly flavonoids) and terpenoids in birch leaves, buds, bark and stems (reviewed in Kein\u00e4nen et al. (1999)). Besides these, studies have also been conducted to determine the phylogenetic relationships in Betula based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers (Schenk et al., 2008), nuclear alcohol dehydrogenase genes (ADH) and chloroplast MaturaseK (MatK) gene sequences (Ja\u00a8 Rvinen et al., 2004).

A cytotoxicity assay was used with L1210 as target cells. This assay determines the inhibitory effect of test samples on the growth of mouse leukemia cells (ATCC L1210). The extracts exhibited 99% and 91% activity respectively at 10 mg per well concentration of the extract. They however exhibited only 15% and 7% antithrombin activity respectively when compared with the blank solution. Antiproliferative activity of Betula pendula was also studied on B16 melanoma cells (Calliste et al., 2001). \u015eoica et al. (2012) studied the antiproliferative effects of Betula pendula bark and its two major compounds betulin (48) and betulinic acid (54)\nin vitro on three human cell lines: HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and A431 (skin epidermoid carcinoma), using the MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]) assay. They were found to possess antiproliferative activities, as is also suggested in the literature against other tumoural cell lines (Fulda, 2008, Drag et al., 2009). Although the birch bark extract presented antiproliferative activity, it was not very different to the main compound in its composition, betulin. They could both be considered important therapeutic compounds for skin pathology but also for other types of hyperproliferative pathologies, including other solid cancers. Although the exact IC50 values were not determined, the results revealed considerable efficacies of both the extract and its active components against A431 and HeLa cell lines. The concentration range in which the proliferation of skin cancer cells was substantially inhibited (approximately 70\u201380%) may present practical significance, especially in the case of local administration. The in vitro data suggested the high efficiency of betulinic acid and also of the related compound betulin as anticancerous agents, but further that the exploitation of their natural source, birch bark extract, could prove to be very useful. Betulin enriched extracts of the bark of Betula pendula, containing over 90% betulin, were also tested for their growth inhibiting effects in vitro on four malignant human cell lines: A431 (skin epidermoid carcinoma), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma) and MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), by means of MTT assay (Dehelean et al., 2012). All of the prepared bark extracts exerted a pronounced antiproliferative effect against human cancer cell lines. The goal of the MTT assay was a direct comparison of the extracts, concluding that the IC50 values of all the samples was between 1 and 5 \u03bcg/mL. The substantial differences in betulin and betulinic acid content of the extracts were not reflected in the antiproliferative activities. The reason of this contradiction could be the presence of other active natural compounds in birch bark, including flavonoids.",

            "text": "A number of extracts from Betula species have shown anti-inflammatory activity in different test models. Tunon et al. (1995) tested the aqueous extract of the leaves of Betula pendula for anti-inflammatory activity using isolated cells and enzymatic tests in vitro. It was evaluated for inhibitory activity on prostaglandin biosynthesis and platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced exocytosis in vitro at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL respectively. The leaves exhibited 23\u00b12% prostaglandin synthesis inhibition and 76+4% PAF-exocytosis inhibition. The effects shown by the extracts of the leaves of Betula pendula might be explained by the high contents of tannins and other kinds of polyphenols. Several hemolytic compounds of dammarane type that have been isolated from the leaves of Betula pendula might affect the neutrophils in the PAF-test and thus influence the result. Later, Wacker et al. (2012) demonstrated the effect of Betula pendula leaf extract (BPE) on corneal inflammation following keratoplasty in the rat model. T cells were stimulated in vitro in the presence of BPE. Proliferation, activation phenotype and the number of apoptotic/necrotic cells in cell culture were analyzed by flow cytometry. Corneal transplantation was performed between Fisher and Lewis rats. Recipient rats were either treated with cyclosporine A at a low dosage (Low-dose CsA=LDCsA) or received LDCsA in combination with BPE (2\u00d71 ml/day). Clinical signs for corneal inflammation and rejection time points were determined. Infiltrating leukocytes were analyzed histologically. BPE specifically inhibited T cell proliferation in vitro by inducing apoptosis. The phenotype was not affected. In vivo, BPE significantly delayed the onset of corneal opacification (p<0.05). The amount of infiltrating CD45(+) leukocytes and CD4(+) T cells (p<0.001) was significantly reduced by BPE, whereas infiltration of CD163(+) macrophages was not significantly different between the two groups. BPE selectively induces apoptosis of activated T cells. Accordingly, BPE treatment significantly reduces infiltrating T cells and subsequent corneal opacification following keratoplasty. The findings suggest BPE as a promising anti-inflammatory drug to treat corneal inflammation. Dehelean et al. (2012) conducted in vivo studies involving the anti-inflammatory effect of Betula pendula extracts on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced model of inflammation in mice. It is well known that in a few hours application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can induce an inflammatory process to mouse ears by increasing vascular permeability, producing edema and swelling inside dermis. Indometacin was used as reference. Both betulin and ethanolic extracts (1 pp and 3 pp) were used to determine the reduction of edema. Betulin was found to be comparable with indometacin; however, the extracts revealed the most intense anti-inflammatory potential probably because of the aggregation of effects of other triterpenes, also present in the extract composition, even in small concentrations (betulinic acid, lupeol etc.).",

            "text": "One of the prominent uses of Betula species in traditional medicine is against arthritis and rheumatism. Several studies have been carried out to support these claims. In vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory properties of plants traditionally used in Czech Republic and Central-East Europe region for gout, arthritis or rheumatism treatment were studied by Havlik et al. (2010). Since gouty arthritis or uric acid nephrolithiasis is a result of marked hyperuricemia, leading to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints or kidneys, the enzyme xanthine oxidase is a possible target for urate-lowering drugs in humans and is used predominately in hypouricemic therapy. Betula pendula and Populus nigra were identified as species with the highest xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential in the study. The 80% ethanolic and methylene chloride\u2013methanolic extracts of Betula pendula exhibited IC50 values of 39.4 and 25.9 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Betula pendula was among the most active supposedly because of the content of salicylates or other phenolics. In another study (Gr\u00fcndemann et al., 2011), in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the extract of Betula pendula on primary human lymphocytes in comparison to the synthetic anti-arthritis drug methotrexate. Lymphocyte proliferation and cell division were measured by the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases and by using the membrane-permeable dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), respectively. Apoptosis was analyzed by surface staining of phosphatidylserine and intracellular activation of effector caspases 3 and 7 in comparison to the drug methotrexate using flow cytometric and photometrical analysis. In addition, the impact of the extract on cell cycle distribution was investigated by propidium iodide staining of DNA. For the bioassays BPE concentrations of 10\u2013160 \u00b5g/mL were investigated. Leaf extracts of Betula pendula inhibited the growth and cell division (CD8+: 40 \u00b5g/mL: 45%; 80 \u00b5g/mL: 60%; 160 \u00b5g/mL: 87%) (CD+: 40 \u00b5g/mL: 33%; 80 \u00b5g/mL: 54%; 160 \u00b5g/mL: 79%) of activated, but not of resting T lymphocytes in a significant dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation due to apoptosis induction (compared to untreated control: 40 \u00b5g/mL: 163%; 80 \u00b5g/mL: 240%; 160 \u00b5g/mL: 348%) and cell cycle arrest was comparable to that of methotrexate. It is known that peripheral blood lymphocytes play an important role in the perpetuation of the autoimmune processes in rheumatoid arthritis and the maintenance of these cells might be caused by the dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis. The study, thus, gave a rational basis for the use of Betula pendula leaf extract for the treatment of immune disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis, by diminishing proliferating inflammatory lymphocytes",

            "text": "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bond remodeling, spur formation, synovial inflammation and the degradation of proteoglycan and collagen. The integrity of these macromolecules is vital to cartilage and joint function. Cho et al. (2006) investigated the cartilage protective effects and mechanism of Betula platyphylla on rabbit articular cartilage. It was observed that the bark extract of Betula platyphylla inhibited the degradation of proteoglycan and collagen through the down regulation of MMP-3 and MMP-13 expressions and activities without affecting the viability or morphology of IL-1\u03b1-stimulated rabbit articular cartilage explants. The n-butanol fraction from the bark of Betula platyphylla (BFBP) was identified as the most potent cartilage protective fraction. It was shown to have protective effects against cartilage degradation in a collagenase-induced osteoarthritis rabbit model (Huh et al., 2009). Oral administration of BFBP dose-dependently suppressed the stiffness and global histologic score. The proteoglycan content was considerably increased in a dose-dependent manner in the BFBP treated group. The mRNA expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was also decreased. On the contrary, the level of TIMP-1 in the synovial fluids was significantly increased in the BFBP treated group. The pathologic inflammatory molecules such as PGE2 and COX-2 were inhibited by BFBP, but COX-1 expression was not affected. It was, therefore, suggested that BFBP showed the protective effect on cartilage alternations through balance of MMPs/TIMP-1. BFBP is a COX-2 inhibitor through suppressing the production of PGE2 and inhibiting of expression of COX-2 in CIA. It regulated inflammatory-related molecules in in vivo model of OA. Huh et al. (2011) also investigated the inhibitory effects of Betula platyphylla in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory efficacy was compared to celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in animal models of arthritis. Betula platyphylla significantly inhibited proliferation of IL-1\u03b2-induced synoviocytes. It reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MMP-1, MMP13, and PGE2. The release of nitrites and iNOS, as well as release of NF-\u03baB, into the nucleus of IL-1\u03b2-treated synoviocytes was significantly inhibited, even at concentrations as low as 1 \u00b5g/mL. Oral administrant of Betula platyphylla at 400 mg/kg significantly decreased about 27.8% of tail flick withdrawal and inhibited the number of paw flinches in both phases 1 and 2 of the formalin test. In the carrageenan-induced acute pain and arthritis model, Betula platyphylla dose dependently reduced the nociceptive threshold and the arthritic symptoms at day 8, respectively. At 400 mg/kg, it markedly reduced the inflammatory area about 48% in the ankle joints. This capacity of Betula platyphylla at 400 mg/kg was similar to that of the celecoxib-2 inhibitor in carrageenan-induced nociceptive and inflammatory arthritis model. These results suggested that Betula platyphylla has anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated RA FLS and in an animal model of arthritis.",

Oral administration of AWB extracts (25, 100 and 250 mg/kg) to the PC-treated mice inhibited the development of AD-like skin lesions as exemplified by a significant decrease in the total skin severity scores, itching behavior and a decrease in hypertrophy and infiltration of inflammatory cells into dermis. The serum IgE level was also significantly reduced by AWB extract. In the RT-PCR results, the expression of interleukin-4 mRNA was reduced by AWB extract, whereas the expression of interferon-\u03b3 mRNA was not changed. These results suggest that AWB inhibits the development of AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice through the suppression of the T(H)2 cell response. Besides, Oh et al. (2012) carried out in vitro and in vivo studies to elucidate whether and how Betula platyphylla modulated the mast cell-mediated allergy inflammation. Pharmacological effects of Betula platyphylla on both compound 48/80 or histamine-induced scratching behaviors and 2,4-dinitrochlrobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis in mice were ascertained. Additionally, to find a possible explanation for the anti-inflammatory effects of Betula platyphylla, the effects of Betula platyphylla on the release of histamine in compound 48/80-induced rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs), production of inflammatory mediators and activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and caspase-1 in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI)-stimulated human mast cells (HMC-1) were also evaluated. The finding of this study demonstrated that Betula platyphylla reduced compound 48/80 or histamine-induced scratching behaviors and DNFB-induced atopic dermatitis in mice. Additionally, it also inhibited the release of histamine in RPMC and production of inflammatory cytokines as well as the activation of NF-\u03baB and caspase-1 in stimulated HMC-1. Collectively, the findings of this study provided novel insights into the pharmacological actions of Betula platyphylla as a potential molecule for use in the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases.",

Studies were thus carried out to evaluate the antioxidant activities of ethanolic and hot water extracts from barks of Canadian wood species, their toxicological effects on normal human keratinocytes and the antiproliferative properties of these extracts on the growth of normal, lesional and non-lesional psoriatic keratinocytes. These properties of crude extracts from barks of Canadian species were also compared with those of the standardized French maritime pine bark extract (Oligopin\u00ae) (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al., 2010). The results showed that yellow birch (Betula alleghalensis) extract obtained by maceration had high antioxidant capacity. Also, that after 24 h the initial toxicities of YBMac and Oligopin\u00ae determined by the TBDE method are comparable. After 48 h, the initial toxicity of YBMac did not significantly vary and Oligopin\u00ae showed to be less toxic. IC90 values determined by the TBDE method after 24 h showed an inverse correlation with the content of CinnAc (r=\u22120.73; p=0.0246) and PAs (r=\u22120.66; p=0.049) whereas after 48 h no correlations could be determined between IC90 and the different classes of phenolic compounds. Toxicity of extracts on keratinocyte plasma membrane and mitochondria after 24 h was attributed to their content of hydroxycinnamic acids and proanthocyanidins. The mean degree of polymerization of proanthocyanidins (DPm) of crude extract from barks of Betula spp. is reported to be 6.4. Thus, it could be hypothesized that the higher degree of polymerization of YBMac proanthocyanidines and the presence of terpenic compounds in this extract, which can be extracted with ethanol at high concentrations (Diouf et al., 2009), could influence on the higher initial toxicity observed on keratinocytes plasma membrane after 24 h. The crude extracts from bark of Canadian wood species and Oligopin\u00ae presented a modest inhibition on the growth of normal and psoriatic keratinocytes, but were not selective for lesional psoriatic cells after exposure during 48 h. YBMac at 90 \u00b5g/mL was shown to inhibit by 26% the NHK growth, but it failed to induce any change in lesional and nonlesional PK growth. These studies demonstrated the toxicological and antiproliferative properties of polyphenolic extracts from barks of yellow birch as well as other Canadian species on normal and psoriatic keratinocytes.",

Proliferation of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with DCs matured with fraction IV, as measured by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, was similar to proliferation of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with control DCs. However, IFN-\u03b3 secretion was reduced and IL-10 and IL-17 secretion was increased, a cytokine profile consistent with a Th17 regulatory phenotype.

It has been demonstrated that the pollens modulate human dendritic cell (DC) function in a way that results in an enhanced T(H)2 polarization in vitro. DC function was analyzed in vitro by using BALB/c bone marrow-derived DCs. T-cell responses were analyzed with DO11.10 peptide 323-339 from chicken ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4 T cells as responder cells. For in vivo studies, OVA-specific CD4 T cells were adoptively transferred into BALB/c mice. 24 h later, mice were challenged by means of intranasal application of OVA in the absence or presence of Bet-APEs or phytoprostanes. Polarization of T-cell responses in vivo was analyzed in draining lymph node cells. In vitro Bet-APEs and E(1)-phytoprostanes dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced IL-12p70 of DCs. In addition, Bet-APEs induced a T(H)2 polarization in vitro. Similarly, intranasal instillation of Bet-APEs in vivo, together with the antigen, leads to increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion and decreased IFN-gamma secretion from antigen-specific T cells in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast, intranasal E1- and F1-phytoprostanes downregulated both T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production in vivo. Thus, Betula alba pollen releases water-soluble factors that display T(H)2-polarizing capacities in vivo independently of E(1)- and F(1)-phytoprostanes.",

However it was found that methyl gallate, methyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate, and methyl 3-O-methylgallate inhibited both aflatoxin production as well as fungal growth of Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus flavus (Jermnak et al., 2012).",

Although betulin can also be isolated from other sources in small amounts, the birch bark could be a large and feasible source of raw material for its isolation on an industrial scale. It can be isolated up to 30% dry weight from the birch bark. The birch tree (Betula spp.) is one of the most widely reported sources of betulinic acid and betulin which can be obtained in considerable quantities. In recent years, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, differentiation-promoting effects and wound-healing properties of betulin have been described. Betulin can be used as such or after chemical modification as a starting compound for other useful materials and compounds, which possess various interesting pharmacological properties. Betulinic acid has been reported to display a wide range of biological and medicinal properties such as inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anti-bacterial, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, antinociceptive, anti-HSV-1, and anti-cancer activities. Because of its selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells and favorable therapeutic index, even at doses up to 500 mg/kg body weight, betulinic acid is a very promising new chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of HIV infection and cancer. In a major step toward realizing clinical chemotherapeutic applications for this class of compounds, the University of Illinois at Chicago had licensed the worldwide rights to develop betulinic acid to Advanced Life Sciences, a company specializing in the development of potential new drug candidates in disease categories including viral infections, cancer, and inflammation.",

Since methyl papyriferate was found to exhibit potent reversing effect on cytotoxicity of colchicine against multidrug resistance (MDR) human cancer cells (KB-C2), several papyriferic acid derivatives were prepared and evaluated for their cytotoxicity and effect on reversing P-gp-mediated MDR against KB-C2 cells. It was observed that 3-O-(Morpholino-\u03b2-oxopropanoyl)-12\u03b2-acetoxy-3\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-(20S,24R)-epoxydammarane significantly increased the sensitivity of colchicine against KB-C2 cells by 185-fold at 5 \u00b5/mL (7.4 \u00b5M), and the cytotoxicity of colchicine was recovered to nearly that of sensitive (KB) cells.

There is a growing importance of triterpenoids as a source of medication for various chronic diseases and several evidences suggest that both natural as well as synthetic triterpenoids have potential anti-cancer activities (Patlolla and Rao, 2012). Although Betula species are currently at the focus of a variety of projects on novel anticancer agents, no direct ethnobotanical link seems to exist between the traditional uses (i.e., as an anticancer agent) and modern biomedical research. This is not surprising, because only few species have recorded uses as anticancer agents. However, many of these uses imply that the extract will modulate the cell cycle, a property that is explored in the development of novel anticancer agents (Heinrich, 2010). There is convincing evidence in experimental animal models in support of anti-carcinogenic effects of Betula bark, betulin as well as betulinic acid.
