Although the precise mechanism underlying HCV replication process remains largely unclear, most of the HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins are known to be involved in membranous web (MW) and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) formed by protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013lipid interactions, which is the site of the viral RNA synthesis [6\u20138]. One of the NS proteins that are indispensable for viral replication is HCV NS4B, which is a hydrophobic protein highly conserved in Flaviviridae family [9]. NS4B expression causes alteration of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and formation of MW, which could provide a platform for HCV viral replication [8, 10]. Our previous work has shown that NS4B expression activates unfolded protein response (UPR), ER overload response, and NF-\u03baB pathway in human hepatic cells, which could contribute to HCV replication and pathogenesis [11\u201313].",

Topology structure studies of NS4B showed that its N-terminal domain comprises two amphipathic \u03b1-helices (AH1 and AH2) with several functional properties. Its central domain consists of four transmembrane domains (TMs) and a nucleotide-binding Walker A motif, mediating HCV viral replication and replication-related focus formation [9]. The C-terminal domain has been suggested to be the major membrane-binding domain, but recent studies showed that it is involved in protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interactions [14, 15].

Scribble is a PDZ-containing protein and has been well known for its roles in cellular polarity [17] and apoptosis [18]. The functions of Scribble have been shown to be modulated by viral proteins [19]. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein affects the localization of Scribble protein and inhibits its activity to attenuate T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) NS5 protein interacts with Scribble to inhibit interferon-mediated JAK-STAT signaling. In addition, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein binds Scribble protein to cause its degradation through proteasome-mediated proteolysis [19].",

Here, we showed that NS4B PBM is a key motif that enables NS4B to interact with Scribble protein, and at least three PDZ domains of Scribble are required for this interaction. Furthermore, this interaction leads to scribble degradation through the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway. We also observed this proteasome-dependent Scribble degradation in HCV-infected Huh7.5.1 cells, suggesting that NS4B has some roles for HCV-mediated Scribble degradation. In addition, NS4B PBM confers the ability of NS4B to transform cells. Taken together, our study revealed a novel mechanism by which NS4B contributes to HCV tumorigenesis by targeting tumor suppressor protein, Scribble, for degradation.",

The replicon Con-1 was kindly provided by Prof. Ralf Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg, Germany).

The full-length cDNA of NS4B gene was designed as NS4BWT, the NS4B with last four amino acids deleted as NS4BD, and the NS4B with last four amino acids mutated as NS4BM. These NS4B sequences were inserted into pEGFPC1 and pFLAG-CMV2 plasmids (Invitrogen, USA) to construct pEGFPC1-NS4B, pEGFPC1-NS4BD, and pEGFPC1-NS4BM and pFLAG-CMV2-NS4B, pFLAG-CMV2-NS4BD, and pFLAG-CMV2-NS4BM, respectively.

As Scribble protein contains four PDZ domains and interacts with the PBM of some viral proteins [19], we hypothesized that HCV NS4B PBM domain could interact with the PDZ domain of Scribble. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected pEGFP-NS4B and pFLAG-CMV2-Scribble expression vectors into 293T cells and analyzed their co-localization by immunofluorescence. HCV NS4B localized throughout the cytoplasm and has a perinuclear staining (Fig. 1a, second panel), consistent with previous reports about NS4B localization [21, 22]. Most importantly, we found that NS4B co-localized with Scribble (Fig. 1a, second and third panels), indicating an interaction between these two proteins. We also observed the co-localization between NS4B and Scribble in other cells lines including HeLa (Fig. 1a, fourth panel) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1a, fifth panel), indicating that HCV NS4B interacts with Scribble protein irrespective of cell lines.\n",

We transfected different amounts of NS4B expression plasmids into 293T and HepG2 cells and then examined the protein levels of Scribble. Increased expression of NS4B significantly reduced Scribble protein levels in both 293T (Fig. 4a) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 4b). In NS4B-transfected 293T and HepG2 cells, NS4B expression was higher at 48-h post-transfection compared with 24-h post-transfection; however, Scribble protein levels were lower at 48-h post-transfection compared with 24-h post-transfection, revealing a negative correlation between NS4B expression and Scribble protein level. We also examined the impact of NS4B on the other two PDZ-containing proteins, lethal giant larvae2 (Lgl2) and protease-activated receptor-3 (Par3). Our data showed that their intracellular protein levels were not altered by NS4B expression (Fig. 4b\u2013d, f; the Par3 protein data was not shown).

To test this hypothesis, we transfected HepG2 cells with NS4B-expressing plasmids. Our results showed that NS4B induced more colonies (increased anchorage-independent growth) than empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 7), consistent with its reported roles in transformation [14]. Moreover, transfection of full-length NS4B significantly yielded more colonies than its PBM mutants, NS4BD or NS4BM (Fig. 7). These data suggest that NS4B promotes cell transformation primarily by its PBM domain-mediated Scribble degradation.\n",

For example, only PDZ domains 4 and 5 of PATJ are required to bind HPV E6 [19].

The influenza A virus NS1 and HTLV-1 Tax proteins interact with Scribble and result in mislocalization of Scribble into cytoplasmic puncta [19]. The influenza A virus NS1-mediated relocalization of Scribble was thought to inhibit the pro-apoptotic function of Scribble. However, we did not observe any location change of Scribble in NS4B expression cells (Fig. 1a). Other viral proteins regulate Scribble protein level. The HPV E6 binds Scribble and results in its degradation through the proteasome pathway [28\u201330]. Similar to HPV E6, we found that HCV NS4B specifically induced Scribble protein degradation with little to no effects on the other two PDZ-containing proteins, Lgl2 and Par3. This is the first report regarding the role of HCV NS proteins in regulating Scribble functions by affecting its protein levels. Moreover, HCV NS4B PBM induced Scribble degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, indicating that HCV NS4B utilized the same strategy with HPV E6 in regulating Scribble. The TBEV NS5 protein directly interacts with Scribble and causes the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway by an unclear mechanism [19]. It is unknown whether HCV NS4B affects the JAK/STAT pathway.",
