Nevertheless, for RA to be a viable alternative to GA, it must guarantee adequate surgical conditions (i.e., with minimal risk of failure), ensure patient safety, and provide consistent protection for health workers.",

Brachial plexus blocks above the clavicle carry an inherent risk of phrenic nerve palsy, which translates to a consequent risk of up to 25% decrease in vital capacity and forced expiratory volume.3 Unfortunately, no reduction in either local anesthetic volume or concentration has consistently reduced the risk of hemi-diaphragmatic paresis below 20%, without increasing the risk of block failure.4 Hence, we strongly recommend performing diaphragm-sparing alternatives, such as a suprascapular nerve block, with or without axillary nerve block5 (or no block at all) for these patients.",
