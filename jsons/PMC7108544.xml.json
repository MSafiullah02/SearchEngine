SARS is a novel disease and people's perceptions on the disease had changed within a very short period of time [2]. Perceptions such as SARS-related perceived susceptibility, perceived mode of transmission, perceived consequences etc. were strongly associated with preventive behaviours [2\u20135]. To our knowledge, perceptions related to recovered SARS patients, including infectivity and health sequelae, discriminatory and avoidance attitudes have not been reported.",

Psychological distress due to SARS is therefore relevant in predicting related avoidance/discriminatory attitudes. Avoidance of these patients may also be considered by the actor to be a form of preventive behaviour. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to investigate preventive behaviours for various diseases [18, 19], including SARS [20]. The model specifies that the practice of preventive behaviours is affected by perceptions including perceived efficacy of the preventive behaviour, perceived consequences and perceived susceptibility of the disease, barriers and cue to actions, etc. [21]. In this case, perceptions related to infectivity and health conditions of recovered SARS patients (i.e. perceived susceptibility and consequences) are most relevant in predicting attitudes related to protective (avoidance) behaviours which can be translated into discriminatory attitudes against these patients.",

For instance, misconceptions about the mode of HIV transmission are common in Hong Kong [22] and were strongly associated with discriminatory attitudes towards PLWHA [12]. Discrimination towards PLWHA not only affects quality of life of these patients [23], but it also undermines community responses for effective prevention [24].",

SARS differ from other infectious diseases in that it became a severe global epidemic within a short period of time while there was almost no information about recovered patients' infectivity and health consequences. Fear was therefore easily induced and avoidance/discrimination against recovered SARS patients was prone to develop. The provision of knowledge has been shown to be successful in reducing HIV-related discrimination and is much warranted [28]. It is important to rectify misconceptions in the general populations. The results of this study therefore show that HBM may also be applicable for studying avoidance behaviours related to infectious diseases, especially those new ones with incomplete knowledge (e.g. SARS and human avian flu).",

Education level was, however, not statistically significant, which was different from results of similar studies on discrimination on HIV/AIDS [12]. It is possible that there is a better knowledge base for HIV/AIDS or disability as compared with SARS and such favours those who attained university education. SARS, however, being a novel disease would be much less affected by gender or education level. Seemingly, there may be less gender and sociodemographic differences in SARS-related discrimination, as compared with HIV-related discrimination. In HIV research, similar findings that knowledge and misconceptions about modes of transmission (such as HIV transmission via daily social contacts) were associated with discrimination towards PLWHA were reported [12, 29, 30]. Therefore, there are both similarities and differences in factors associated with disease-related discriminations among different types of infectious disease. Knowledge and perception about mentally ill and disabled persons were also associated with relevant discriminatory attitudes [8, 9].",

Most of them were likely to have been seen as victims, whereas HIV/AIDS patients are more often seen to be personally responsible for contracting the disease, as compared with patients of other illnesses such as cancer [31].

Similar Knowledge, Attitude, Beliefs and Practices studies using telephone surveys are quite common [2, 22]. Second, the response rate was not very high (61.8%) though it is comparable with many other telephone surveys conducted in Hong Kong [2, 22, 33]. The gender and age compositions of this study are similar to those of the Census distribution (Census: % male = 47.5% and % aged 45\u201360 = 32.9%; this study: % male = 45.3% and % aged 45\u201360 = 36.5%) [34]. Reporting biases due to social desirability may exist. Yet, the direction of such biases should favour under-reporting of avoidance/discrimination responses. Measurement of avoidance/discriminatory attitudes may be another limitation although the items were mainly adopted from local HIV surveys; validated scales on measuring avoidance/discrimination towards SARS patients was used as they do not exist. A panel of researchers assessed the face validity of these items but test\u2013retest had not been performed. Further, only the dimensions on avoiding contacts and job-related discrimination have been studied. It is uncertain whether such perceptions would persist over time. The study only investigated perceptions, not behaviours. Perceptions may not result in behaviours though the two are correlated with each other. The role of the media has not been covered by this study. The reasons for exhibiting discriminatory attitudes behind have not been sought in this study. Qualitative studies are required to investigate reasons operating behind the observed perceptions. Further studies are therefore warranted.",
