Because we detected a high percentage (39.39%) of HRV/RSV co-infections, we compared the clinical symptoms and severity between patients with HRV-A or HRV-C single infections to those of patients with HRV/RSV co-infections. The median age of patients co-infected with HRV/RSV was significantly lower than that of patients with single HRV-A or HRV-C infection. Furthermore, more children with dual infections had shortness of breath than those with single infections. Common causes of shortness of breath are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia.28 Because the prevalence of asthma is low in Chinese children,29 shortness of breath can be assumed to be an indication of CAP severity. In addition, in the HRV-A positive group, more children with co-infections had three severe indices and respiratory failure than those with single HRV infection (5:1 and 9:4, respectively). These differences between HRV single infection and HRV/RSV co-infections may be attributed to the RSV infection. RSV seems to be a more virulent virus, infecting younger age groups, causing shortness of breath and other symptoms. For instance, Midulla et al. reported that infants with RSV bronchiolitis were younger and had a significantly higher clinical severity score upon hospital admission than infants with HRV bronchiolitis.30 Further investigations of such co-infections are necessary to evaluate their specific role in disease severity.",
