Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 activity is expressed as the ratio between product, Ang(1\u20137), and substrate, Ang II. Figure 1 is an example of a typical SELDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS peptide chromatographic profile for an ACE2 assay in plasma (Fig. 1A\n), kidney (Fig. 1B\n) and hypothalamus (Fig. 1C\n) from normal C57Bl/6 mice. The two MS peaks seen in Fig. 1B and C\n are the assay substrate, Ang II (1045, m/z), and peptide product, Ang(1\u20137) (899, m/z). Data provide evidence for ACE2\u2010like activity in kidney and brain with no detectable activity in plasma. Incubation of Ang II with heat\u2010inactivated brain tissue failed to generate Ang(1\u20137) (data not shown). Based on these findings, we measured ACE2 activity in various brain regions (Table 1). The ACE2 activity was highest in hypothalamus and lowest in brainstem and pituitary. The linearity of the MS ACE2 assay is shown in Fig. 2, in which varying concentrations of a hypothalamic extract (20\u201380 ng protein) were tested for ACE2 activity. There was a linear relationship between protein concentration and ACE2 activity (r\n2= 0.92).",

Figure 3 shows the dose\u2010related inhibitory effect of DX600 on hypothalamic ACE2 activity. Angiotensin II (5 \u03bcm) was incubated with hypothalamic extract (40 ng protein) in the presence and absence of DX600 (1 and 10 \u03bcm; Fig. 3B\u2013D\n). Hypothalamic ACE2 activity was 92% inhibited by 1 \u03bcm DX600 (Fig. 3C\n), and the higher dose (10 \u03bcm) produced more than 99% inhibition (Fig. 3D\n). A lower dose of DX600 (0.1 \u03bcm) inhibited ACE activity by 20% (data not shown). The reaction was completely blocked by EDTA (10 mm), while captopril had no effect on ACE2 activity (data not shown). Generation of Ang(1\u20137) was not inhibited by Z\u2010PP, a selective inhibitor of prolyl\u2010endopeptidase. These results document the specificity of the reaction, indicating that the peptide cleavage was produced by ACE2 and not by non\u2010specific degradation of Ang II.",

There was no evidence for production of Ang(1\u20137) (899.7, m/z). A different peptide profile was observed when Ang I was incubated with a hypothalamic extract (Fig. 4C\n). Angiotensin II was almost undetectable, indicating that ACE activity is low in brain. Moreover, the chromatograph showed that in hypothalamus, Ang(1\u20137) was the primary angiotensin peptide product generated when Ang I was used as a substrate (Fig. 4C). The absence of detectable Ang(1\u20139) (1183, m/z) suggests that Ang I is not a good substrate for ACE2. This is supported by previous experiments which tested the proteolytic profile of recombinant human ACE2 (Rice et al. 2004; Elased et al. 2006).",

To confirm these results, we compared the MS assay with the traditional colorimetric ACE assay (Hurst & Lovell\u2010Smith, 1984). Plasma (0.5 \u03bcl) and kidney or hypothalamic extracts (1 \u03bcg protein) were incubated with Ang I (5 \u03bcm). Angiotensin I and generated Ang II and the ratios were quantified using SELDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS. As shown in Fig. 6A\n, hypothalamic ACE activity was almost undetectable compared with that in kidney and plasma (P < 0.001). Captopril (10 \u03bcm) inhibited the generation of Ang II in kidney and plasma (Fig. 6A\n, P < 0.001), indicating that Ang II was generated by the action of ACE. The experiment was repeated using the conventional colorimetric assay. Plasma (20 \u03bcl) and kidney or hypothalamic extract (160 \u03bcg protein) were incubated with the synthetic substrate, N\u2010hippuryl\u2010l\u2010histidyl\u2010l\u2010leucine. The released hippuric acid was colorimetrically quantified and results expressed as ACE units. Figure 6B\n shows that ACE activity in hypothalamus was below the detection limit of the assay and was not significantly altered by captopril (10 \u03bcm). As expected, ACE activity was detected in kidney and plasma and was significantly inhibited by 10 \u03bcm captopril (P < 0.001, Fig. 6B\n).

The ACE activity was measured in kidney, brain and plasma from C57BL/6 (two\u2010copy) or ACE overexpression mice (four\u2010copy; Fig. 7). Hypothalamic ACE activity was low to undetectable compared with kidney and plasma in ACE two\u2010copy mice.

Since this system is a complex of bioactive peptides with a regulatory enzymatic cascade, characterization of current and prospective drugs requires data on peptide processing as well as sensitive proteolytic enzyme assays. There is much clinical interest in measurement of renin and ACE activity as biomarkers for disease states such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and renal dysfunction. However, recent data indicate that Ang(1\u20137), a product of the carboxypeptidase, ACE2, may be important in regulating cardiovascular function (Tipnis et al. 2000; Vickers et al. 2002; Ferrario, 2006). Like ACE, the substrate affinity of ACE2 is not confined to the RAS; for example, it also efficiently degrades des\u2010Arg9 bradykinin (Vickers et al. 2002; Huang et al. 2003). However, it is the ability of ACE2 to inactivate the vasoconstrictor, Ang II, and to generate the metabolite, Ang(1\u20137), that implicates ACE2 as an important participant in cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 and Ang(1\u20137) become potential targets in the development of novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular disease (Raizada & Ferreira, 2007).",

We have taken advantage of MS technology to develop proteolytic assays for ACE, ACE2 and renin activities in plasma and tissue (2005, 2006). The proteolytic angiotensin peptide products are identified by m/z and quantified by peak intensity. Results show that the enzymatic reactions produce the predicted angiotensin peptides with inhibition by specific inhibitors. For example, incubation of plasma with Ang I resulted in formation of Ang II with a linear relationship between substrate depletion and product formation. There was also a correlation between incubation time and product formation. In the present study, we exploited the sensitivity and selectivity of SELDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS to study brain ACE and ACE2 and other enzymes such as NEP which generate Ang(1\u20137) from Ang I and Ang II. The assay system allows for relative comparison of multiple proteolytic enzymes contributing to angiotensin peptide processing in brain. Plasma and kidney were used as known sources of ACE and ACE2, respectively, and provided a means of comparison with brain. The goal was to address the ability of brain tissue to metabolize Ang I and Ang II and to directly evaluate the contributions of ACE/ACE2 activity. Proteolytic enzyme activities were measured directly rather than using other indices of the RAS such as protein levels or mRNA expression.",

The substrate peptide contains a fluorescent 7\u2010methoxycoumarin group which is quenched by energy transfer to a 2,4\u2010dinitrophenyl group. A fluorogenic peptide substrate, Mca\u2010Y\u2010V\u2010A\u2010D\u2010A\u2010P\u2010K (Dnp)\u2010OH is used to measure activity of ACE2 or peptidases that are capable of cleaving an amide bond between the fluorescent and quencher groups. Examples of other enzymes that would be active in this assay are ACE (Wysocki et al. 2006), caspase\u20101 and interleukin\u2010converting enzyme (Enari et al. 1996). The assay has been improved by the use of a different fluorogenic substrate, Mca\u2010A\u2010P\u2010K (Dnp)\u2010OH, which is more specific for ACE2 (Vickers et al. 2002; Guy et al. 2003). It is also possible to use radioactive angiotensin peptides (125I\u2010Ang I and 125I\u2010Ang II) for the study of angiotensin metabolism and as a screen for ACE2 activity in kidney and heart (Ferrario et al. 2005b\n; Shaltout et al. 2007). While this approach is reliable and accurate, it is time consuming and requires the use of radioactivity and chromatographic separation of substrate and peptide products. The advantage of the MS\u2010based methods is the ability to utilize endogenous peptide substrates for ACE and ACE2 without the need of synthetic, artificial fluorogenic or radioactive substrates.",

However, the role of brain ACE2 in the generation of this peptide is not well understood. The original study described ACE2 in heart, kidney and testis, but failed to demonstrate its presence in brain (Donoghue et al. 2000). Subsequent studies using quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (Harmer et al. 2002) and immunohistochemistry (Doobay et al. 2007) revealed that ACE2 is localized in brain. There is also evidence for the presence of ACE2 mRNA in cultured astrocytes (Gallagher et al. 2006) and mouse brain (Lin et al. 2008).

Other supportive data show that the reaction is inhibited by an ACE2 inhibitor, DX600, but not by captopril.

In fact, there was no evidence for ACE activity in brain even though it was easily detected in kidney and plasma. This was seen using either the MS proteolytic or the conventional colorimetric assay. Furthermore, a test using a model of ACE overexpression (Krege et al. 1997) failed to show evidence for ACE activity in hypothalamus. This occurred even though there were markedly higher ACE levels in plasma and kidney in the four\u2010copy ACE mice. Most studies of brain ACE have relied on the use of immunochemical methods (Johren et al. 1997) or receptor binding assays (Chai et al. 1987; Rogerson et al. 1995; Johren & Saavedra, 1996) to support the idea of an active brain ACE system. A recent study reports that brain ACE activity is low in brain of perindopril\u2010treated mice (Eckman et al. 2006). Results showed more than 90% inhibition of serum ACE with only a slight inhibition of brain ACE even though perindopril readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier. Using HPLC separation with radioimmunoassay, brain Ang II levels were undetectable despite pooling the tissue from three mice (Alexiou et al. 2005). There are also data from an in situ hybridization study which revealed low levels of ACE mRNA throughout the mouse hypothalamus (Johren & Saavedra, 1996).

This is an unexpected finding because Ang II and its receptors are present and active in the brain (reviewed by McKinley et al. 2003). Injection of Ang II peripherally or centrally activates brain systems, with effects blocked by angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers. However, these experiments rely on the response to exogenous peptide or antagonist administration, which is not the same as the endogenous state. It would be interesting to determine whether there are changes in brain ACE and ACE2 activity in animals or humans with cardiovascular dysfunction.

However, Ang(1\u20137)\u2010forming activity from Ang II, putative ACE2 activity, was not altered in these mice. This supports the idea that brain ACE2 has a distinct role in inactivating Ang II which is separate from NEP. Our data also showed that conversion of Ang I to Ang(1\u20137) was not inhibited by the ACE2 inhibitor, DX600, which suggested that NEP might be involved in this metabolic pathway. Indeed, there are data which support the idea that NEP plays a role in generation of Ang(1\u20137) (Chappell et al. 1989; Welches et al. 1991). Taken together, the data indicate minimal importance for ACE in brain metabolism.

A recent clinical trial showed that plasma ACE2 was detectable in <10% of individuals, within a study population of 500 (Rice et al. 2006). While there is evidence showing Ang(1\u20137) in plasma and urine which is physiologically regulated, the source of the peptide is not certain (Brosnihan et al. 2004; Ferrario et al. 2005a\n). A recent study in sheep demonstrated the presence of serum ACE2 activity which converted Ang II to Ang(1\u20137) but did not cleave Ang I into Ang\u2010(1\u20139) (Shaltout et al. 2007). In rats, ACE2 was measured in plasma and found to be increased after coronary arterial ligation (Ocaranza et al. 2006). It was surprising that the increase in rat plasma ACE2 activity was not associated with an increase in plasma Ang(1\u20137), but rather with an increase in Ang (1\u20139). This would suggest that ACE2 preferentially cleaves Ang I rather than Ang II. This observation does not agree with our data or with previous studies which demonstrate that Ang II is efficiently cleaved by ACE2, almost 400\u2010fold more active with Ang II as substrate compared with Ang I (Vickers et al. 2002). We also found no evidence for ACE2\u2010dependent formation of Ang(1\u20139) from Ang I (data not shown). Therefore, an important criterion for in vivo ACE2 activity would be detection of increased Ang(1\u20137). The generation of Ang(1\u20137) in the brain was not inhibited by Z\u2010PP, a selective inhibitor of prolyl\u2010endopeptidase, which is capable of generating Ang(1\u20137). It was not possible to address the possible activity of prolyl carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.16.2) in the generation of Ang(1\u20137) in the brain because all the assays were carried out in the presence of 2 mm PMSF, an inhibitor of prolyl carboxypeptidase (Odya et al. 1978).",

This provides further evidence to support a vital role for localized ACE2 and tissue specificity of the RAS.
