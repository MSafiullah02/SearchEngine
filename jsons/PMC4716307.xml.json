A pool of three siRNA sequences targeting each gene was tested in 384-well format to identify suppressors of erastin-induced ferroptosis. A pool of siRNAs targeting VDAC3, which was previously identified as an essential gene for erastin-induced ferroptosis, was used as a positive control on each plate (Figure 1a).9 HT-1080 cells were reverse transfected with siRNAs for 72 h, after which they were treated with either 7 \u03bcM erastin (GI100, the concentration required for 100% growth inhibition; this meant that we could only detect suppressors, not enhancers, in the screen) or an equivalent volume of DMSO as a vehicle control, for 24 h (Figure 1b). Growth inhibition (%GI) was calculated for each pool of siRNAs, and screening data were analyzed using CellHTS2, an R-based open source software package.13 Gene knockdowns that prevented erastin-induced ferroptosis by more than three median absolute distribution (MAD) from the median were rescreened in a second cell line (BJeLR), in the same manner as in HT-1080 cells (Supplementary Figure S1A).8 BJeLR cells are fibroblast cells harboring oncogenic hTERT, Simian Virus 40 large and small T oncogenes and oncogenic HRAS, and are sensitive to ferroptosis.14",

We used Panc-1 cells to decrease the chances of finding a genetic modulator of ferroptosis that might be cell-line or lineage specific, and because Panc-1 cells are derived from a different tissue lineage, but are sensitive to ferroptosis. Toxic siRNAs that decreased viability to <30% of control were not further evaluated. Eleven genes reproducibly suppressed erastin-induced ferroptosis upon knockdown in both HT-1080 cells (three sequences, t-test, P<0.05 compared with nontargeting siRNA) and Panc-1 cells (three sequences, t-test, P<0.05; Supplementary Table SI1). These 11 genes were associated with distinct pathways. Knockdown of CARS had by far the most robust suppressive effect, so we further investigated the function of this gene in ferroptosis (Figure 1c).",

These siRNA sequences knocked down CARS protein and mRNA levels as determined through immunoblotting and qPCR (Figure 2b). Independent shRNA constructs targeting CARS also showed a suppressive phenotype, corresponding to the degree of mRNA knockdown (Supplementary Figure S1B). CARS knockdown with siRNA was able to rescue from erastin treatment for longer than 24 h (Supplementary Figure S1C). Moreover, overexpression of a CARS cDNA construct, with the third codon of the siRNA target sequence mutated, prevented knockdown of CARS with the siRNAs and reversed the suppressive effects of siCARS, restoring sensitivity to erastin (Supplementary Figure S2A). CARS overexpression on its own did not sensitize to erastin-induced lethality, suggesting that excess CARS abundance does not further contribute to erastin-induced ferroptosis (Supplementary Figure S2B). These experiments established that CARS expression is essential for erastin-mediated ferroptosis.",

Specifically, we tested two other compounds that induce ferroptosis through distinct mechanisms (1 S,3 R)-RSL3 (hereafter referred to as RSL3, which inhibits GPX4 directly) and FIN56, which causes depletion of GPX4 protein (Shimada et al., under review), and on the lethality of the apoptosis inducers doxorubicin (a DNA-damaging agent and topoisomeriase inhibitor) and rotenone (an inducer of mitochondrial ROS generation), in HT-1080 cells. CARS knockdown did not suppress the lethality of any of these compounds (Figure 2d), indicating that the suppressive effect of CARS is likely specific for ferroptosis induced by system xc\u2212 inhibition. In support of this observation, the lethality of ME II and PE, two erastin analogs that also inhibit system xc\u2212, was suppressed by CARS knockdown. Given that RSL3 and FIN56 act at the level of GPX4 inactivation, leading to accumulation of lipid peroxides and execution of ferroptosis,6 we hypothesized that CARS knockdown inhibits erastin's lethality upstream of GPX4. CARS knockdown did not suppress the lethality of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, in HT-1080 cells, suggesting that CARS knockdown does not protect from lethality in response to inhibiting this step in glutathione synthesis (Supplementary Figure S2D). BSO, however, has been documented to induce both ferroptosis and apoptosis in different contexts, potentially complicating the interpretation of this result.",

As expected, CARS knockdown inhibited erastin's ability to induce C11-BODIPY oxidation (Figure 3a), but did not have an effect on RSL3's ability to induce C11-BODIPY oxidation (Supplementary Figure S3B).

However, co-treatment of siCARS with PPG resensitized cells to erastin, suggesting that the transsulfuration pathway is necessary for siCARS's ability to suppress erastin's lethality. PPG co-treatment with CARS knockdown also resensitized to erastin in 143B cells (Supplementary Figure S3D).

Using MARS knockdown as a negative control and CARS, EPRS and HARS knockdown as positive controls for suppression of erastin lethality, we performed RT-qPCR on cells upon knockdown of these genes. Indeed, we found that upon EPRS knockdown, the transsulfuration pathway genes CBS, CTH, PSAT1 and PSPH were upregulated, whereas MARS knockdown had no effect on the mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3g and Supplementary Figure S3I). CARS and HARS knockdown upregulated CBS and PSAT1. The variable response of some tRNA synthetase knockdown's ability to rescue from erastin was also observed using small molecule inhibitors of tRNA synthetases. Co-treatment with halofuginone, an inhibitor of EPRS, suppressed erastin's lethality and upregulated CBS and PSAT1, whereas histidinol, an inhibitor of HARS, did not suppress erastin and did not upregulate the transsulfuration genes (viability in Supplementary Figure S3J and mRNA in Supplementary Figure S3K). The precise mechanism by which knockdown or small molecule inhibition of some tRNA synthetases leads to induction of genes associated with transsulfuration is not known. Nonetheless, upregulation of transsulfuration genes was predictive of the knockdown of tRNA synthetases to cause resistance to erastin-induced ferroptosis, suggesting that this is a key mechanism involved in their suppressive activity on ferroptosis.",

PC12 cells were sensitive to both erastin and glutamate, and both lethal agents were rescued upon treatment with any of the ferroptosis inhibitors Fer-1, deferoxamine (DFO), and ATOC (Figure 4a). The lethality of both erastin and glutamate was also associated with increased lipid ROS levels (Figure 4b), consistent with induction of ferroptosis. To confirm that the mechanism by which PC12 cells were dying in response to glutamate was due to cystine depletion, we co-treated cells with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), which allows cells to take up cystine circumventing system xc\u2212 inhibition, and with glutamate.21\n\u03b2-ME co-treatment rescued cells from glutamate toxicity, signifying that PC12 cells undergo cell death due to cystine depletion in response to glutamate (Figure 4c).
