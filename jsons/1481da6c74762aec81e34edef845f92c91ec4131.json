Most of these patients had vascular risk factors but nearly a fifth did not, and none had known coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Thus, it is possible that COVID-19 related thromboembolism may follow multiple separate pathogenetic pathways. In patients with pre-existing vascular risk factors, it may predispose to the ischemic event earlier than if purely driven by those underlying conditions. This could explain why some of our younger patients in the 40-50 age range presented with stroke. In these situations, it may follow the paradigm seen in other hypercoagulable conditions where two or more factors act synergistically to increase risk of stroke. (12) It can also be likened to the double-hit theory of many cancers. (24) It is also possible that in some cases this hypercoagulable condition by itself is enough to cause an embolic stroke. This may be correlated with elevated lab markers like D-Dimer or NLR ratio or presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.
