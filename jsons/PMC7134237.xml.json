Consequently, customer satisfaction needs a holistic approach and banks are continuously looking for ways to attract new customers and retain existing customers.

As such, customer satisfaction is critical in ensuring business goals are achieved. The achievement of goals the customer set out to achieve without limitations results in customer satisfaction [5], which is key to customer retention [6]. However, Rauyruen and Miller [7] identified factors that impact customer satisfaction, in addition to contextual and personal aspects, price, product quality and service quality also plays a role. According to Hallowell [8], profitability of banks depends on customer loyalty derived from customer satisfaction. Service quality, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty in retail banking are linked together [9]. Mihelis et al. [10] linked customer satisfaction to excellence that can be applied to any organisation. Customer satisfaction requires organisations to not only match customer expectations but exceed them in order to promote customers retention [11].",

Given the increasing introduction of online services, a new scale was necessary to measure service quality delivered through online services \u2013 hence the emergence of E-S-QUAL.

A positive coefficient means that there is a direct relation between the two variables, meaning that as one variable increases, the other increases [36]. Age-income have a moderate positive relationship, meaning as age of users increases so does their income. The same trend is noted for both income-experience and income-device relations. High-income earners tend to make use of both mobile and desktop computer to access online banking and are generally more satisfied with the service quality. On the other hand, the relations between income-use_frequency have a moderate negative relationship. This implies that as income increases the frequency at which users access online banking decreases. Interestingly, only device has any notable correlation with E-S-QUAL mean values, that is, a very weak positive relationship. This leads to the conclusion that E-S-QUAL is not influenced by any of the variables investigated since no medium or strong relationships exist at 0.05 level, albeit a very weak one with device.

These can be considered for further research to assist in the evolution of E-S-QUAL. A larger sample would also make the generalisation of findings across the whole population of online banking users. This also allows the reporting to include bank names without unwarranted prejudice. Further research is needed to also include current aspects such as user experience of online banking that affect customer satisfaction and provide a holistic service quality assessment. Also of consideration as future work is a qualitative study that investigates new constructs by asking online banking users what services they need, instead of an evaluation of the currently provided services.
