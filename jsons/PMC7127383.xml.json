AOPs involving PS activation have been successfully utilized to inactivate microorganisms (such as Coronavirus and Norwalk virus) (Thayer, 2003) and degrade a variety of organic pollutants (McCallum et al., 2000; Lau et al., 2007; Waldemer et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2016). Ultraviolet (UV), a common disinfection and oxidation method, can activate PS (UV/PS process) to produce SO4\n\u2022\n\u2212 (Eq.

The resulting chain reactions are summarized in Table S1 (Eqs.

            "text": "Low-pressure (LP) mercury lamps are a highly efficient UV light source for water treatment, with a photon-energy efficiency of approximately 36% (Bolton, 2006). By using synthetic silica in the production of the lamp tube, LP mercury lamps can deliver two major resonance lines at 185 and 254 nm (i.e., vacuum-UV (VUV)/UV irradiation), and the manufacturing and operating costs of VUV/UV LP mercury lamps are close to those of a conventional LP mercury lamp (Li et al., 2016). VUV (185 nm) readily photolyzes H2O into HO\u2022 by homolysis and ionization (Eqs. (2) and (3)) (Gonzalez et al., 2004). Moreover, recent studies found that organic pollutant degradation in a UV/chlorine process when a VUV/UV lamp was used as the light source (VUV/UV/chlorine process) was more efficient than that of conventional UV irradiation (UV/chlorine process) owing to the additional formation of HO\u2022 (Eqs. (2) and (3)) (Gonzalez et al., 2004) and the synergistic effect (Li et al., 2016). Therefore, VUV/UV LP mercury lamps could serve as a highly efficient light source for UV-based AOPs. However, the application of the VUV/UV/PS process in water treatment has not been studied. Thus, it is necessary to explore organic pollutant degradation by this highly efficient AOP.(2)H2O+hv185\u2192HO\u2022+H\u2022 (\u03a6HO\u2022=0.33)\n(3)H2O+hv185\u2192HO\u2022+H++eaq\u2212 (\u03a6HO\u2022=0.045)\n",

The removal kinetics and mechanisms of MB under different conditions (such as various impact factors and real waters) using chemical (Qi et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Wolski and Ziolek, 2018; Ren et al., 2019) and physical technologies (Bulut and Ayd\u0131n, 2006; Qi et al., 2015; Bedin et al., 2016; Wolski and Ziolek, 2018; Ren et al., 2019) have been discussed with drawbacks of the generation of iron sludge, difficulties in separation and regeneration of catalysts, membrane fouling, and high cost. UV-based AOPs were found to be highly efficient for removing MB, which is commonly used as a model organic pollutant (Bulut and Ayd\u0131n, 2006; Qi et al., 2015; Bedin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Wolski and Ziolek, 2018; Ren et al., 2019) with good stability under UV irradiation and easy detection. Moreover, when combined with the previously developed mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system (MVPS; Fig. S1) (Li et al., 2016), MB concentration can be measured precisely and rapidly with an online UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer during its degradation in the UV-based AOPs, which could avoid sampling errors and reduce the workload.",

The effects of solution pH and water matrix components were assessed, and the main ROSs and their consumption distributions in different types of real water were elucidated. Additionally, the pH impact on the photon absorption distributions was explored to understand the roles of direct photolysis (VUV and UV) and indirect oxidation by various oxidants at different pH levels. This study proposes a new UV-based AOP for water treatment, which could be used for highly efficient organic pollutant removal.",

The flow rate was 60 mL min\u20131 and the reaction solution temperature was maintained at 25 \u00b0C using a water recirculator (DHX-0515, Shunma Technology Co., China). The solution pH was adjusted using various solutions (H3PO4, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, and Na3PO4) with total phosphate concentrations of 2.0 mM, unless otherwise stated. During the total organic carbon (TOC) tests, solution samples were withdrawn and quenched with excess Na2S2O3 before analysis.

Additionally, k\u2032VUV/UV/PS (327.6 m2 einstein\u20121) was 3.2 times higher than k\u2032UV/PS as more ROSs were produced by the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS.",

Therefore, k\u2032VUV/UV/PS and TOC removal ratio in the VUV/UV/PS process at different pH levels were studied and are shown in Fig. 2\n. k\u2032VUV/UV/PS increased within a pH range of 3.0\u20137.0, and then decreased as the solution pH further increased from 7.0 to 11.0; the highest k\u2032VUV/UV/PS was observed at pH 7.0. However, the TOC removal ratio steadily decreased with increasing solution pH. The required levels of target parent pollutant and TOC (or chemical oxygen demand) removal in practical water treatment differ. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind the different trends of k\u2032VUV/UV/PS and TOC removal ratio at various pH levels, which could be useful for selecting an economic treatment strategy according to the specific requirements of a certain scenario (this is discussed in detail in Section 3.6).",

The acceleration of the reaction rate between SO4\n\u2022\u2012and HO\u2012 (Eq.

However, for kHO\u2022\u2032, increasing solution pH enhanced HO\u2022 generation by reducing SO4\n\u2022\u2012 concentration (Eqs. (S7) and (S8); Table S1) and weakened the scavenging effect of H+ on HO\u2022 (Tang and Huang, 1996). Meanwhile, EHO\u2022\u00b0declined as the solution pH increased (Kim and Vogelpohl, 1998). Additionally, the concentration of HPO4\n2\u2012, which could react with ROSs more rapidly than the reaction between H2PO4\n\u2012 and ROSs (Table S2) (Pan et al., 2017), was higher under alkaline conditions, thereby decreasing the concentrations of ROSs. As a result, the minimum and maximum kHO\u2022\u2032 (236.5 and 275.3 m2 einstein\u22121) values were observed at pH 11.0 and 7.0, respectively.",

However, owing to the similar manufacturing costs and power inputs of VUV/UV and conventional LP mercury lamps, the organic pollutant removal efficiency and water treatment cost of the VUV/UV/PS process could be better than those of the UV/PS process. The evaluation of energy consumption for various treatment processes was detailed in Text S4 and the electrical energy per order value of 0.347 kW h m\u22123 order\u22121 (Table S4) suggest a good application potential of the VUV/UV/PS process in effectively degrading organic pollutants.",

The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results:\u2022MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was more rapid than that in the conventional UV/PS process. Increasing PS dose enhanced MB degradation, while the addition of HA, HCO3\n\u2212, Cl\u2212, NO3\n\u2212, and SO4\n2\u2012 inhibited MB degradation to different degrees. The effects of Fe(II) and Fe(III) were dependent on the iron concentrations.\u2022Unlike the steady decrease in the TOC removal ratio, k\u2032VUV/UV/PS first increased and then decreased with increasing solution pH. This is because various pH levels induced different roles of photolysis and oxidation. Increasing solution pH increased the contributions of direct VUV and UV photolysis to MB degradation, but were ineffective in mineralizing MB and its intermediate products.\u2022HO\u2022 and SO4\n\u2022\u2012 were identified as the two dominant ROSs and were mainly consumed by the DOC and Cl\u2012 in real waters, respectively. The tests conducted in real waters demonstrate that the VUV/UV/PS process has a good potential for highly efficient removal of organic pollutant in practice.\u2022As the parent compound and TOC are two different objects for removal in water treatment, this study may provide an economic treatment strategy that can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of a certain scenario.\n",
