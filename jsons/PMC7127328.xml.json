            "text": "Our knowledge of the virosphere is scant. Although viruses are the most abundant source of nucleic acid on earth, with every species of cellular life likely harboring multiple viruses, until recently most studies of virus biodiversity and evolution were of limited scope, with a strong focus on aquatic environments and prokaryotic DNA viruses (Angly et al., 2006, Culley et al., 2006, Desnues et al., 2008, Paez-Espino et al., 2016, Philosof et al., 2017). Far less is known about the diversity of RNA viruses in terrestrial organisms. This has begun to change following advances in bulk genome sequencing that have initiated a new age of virus discovery, in which it is now possible to rapidly document the entire virome of groups of host organisms (Li et al., 2015, Shi et al., 2016a). As well as greatly expanding our knowledge of virus diversity, including the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of highly divergent viruses that often elude characterization, these new data will enable us to determine the fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes that shape the virosphere, and better understand the virus-host interactions that lead to disease emergence. It is also clear that the virus diversity generated from these genomic studies will radically shake-up attempts to classify the virus world (Simmonds et al., 2017a).",

As the transcriptome data generated by RNA-Seq is able to provide an unbiased and likely comprehensive view of all the viruses present within a host sample \u2013 that is, their complete virome \u2013 it can also be thought of as \u2018meta-transcriptomics\u2019. The data generated by meta-transcriptomics is a rich source of evolutionary and ecological information. As a case in point, meta-transcriptomic studies of invertebrates have unearthed remarkable levels of untapped virus genetic diversity, such that the virosphere is evidently far broader and more complex than previously anticipated (Li et al., 2015, Shi et al., 2016a, Webster et al., 2015). For example, an analysis of 220 species from nine invertebrate phyla identified a remarkable 1445 novel RNA viruses, as well as potentially novel genera and families (or orders) (Shi et al., 2016a). Aside from its evolutionary utility which we will discuss in more detail below, meta-transcriptomics allows the identification of novel microbial pathogens \u2013 that is, those associated with overt disease in their hosts \u2013 on clinically actionable time-scales (Wilson et al., 2014). Indeed, it is possible that with a continually declining cost meta-transcriptomics may eventually be used for routine microbiological diagnostics. A key advantage of this over other diagnostic techniques is that it has the potential to detect, in an unbiased fashion, any pathogen that produces an RNA molecule (DNA viruses, bacteria, fungi, eukaryotes), as well as the obvious case of RNA viruses. Hence, if appropriate tissues are analyzed meta-transcriptomics may provide a one stop diagnostic shop.",

Indeed, metagenomics provides an unbiased survey of the genetic material within a sample, and has revolutionized virus discovery in terms of speed, accuracy, sensitivity, and the amount of information generated (Firth and Lipkin, 2013). Among the various metagenomics approaches are available, meta-transcriptomics has recently come to the fore. This approach involves gathering total transcriptome information from a host sample after depletion of ribosomal (r) RNA, as this is the dominant component of the host transcriptome. Compared to metagenomics protocols that involve viral particle enrichment (reviewed in Kumar et al., 2017), this method is far simpler yet still achieves a high level of sensitivity, generality, and efficiency for virus discovery (Fig. 1\n). Previous methodologies were often based on removing as much nucleic acid outside viral particles as possible by filtering, centrifugation, lysis, and nuclease treatment, although this seldom results in a complete depletion of host RNA (Firth and Lipkin, 2013, Mokili et al., 2012). In contrast, in meta-transcriptomics total RNA (i.e. the transcriptome) is directly extracted from untreated homogenates and used for library preparation without filtering and nuclease digestion steps.",

In turn, abundance level can provide important pointers to disease associations, whether viruses are segmented (such that genomic components have similar or different expression levels), and help identify those viruses that are in fact derived from other eukaryotic organisms present in the host sampled, such as in undigested food or prey, gut micro flora, and parasites, or simply contamination (and the greater the virus abundance, the more likely that active viral infection has occurred in the host under consideration).

However, subsequent studies have revealed a remarkable diversity of orthomyxo-like viruses in invertebrates, including mosquitoes, cockroaches and earthworms, that fell both basal to, and interleaved among, the previously known genera on phylogenetic trees (Li et al., 2015). Hence, the gaps on the tree have been dramatically filled and the previous genera no long appear as phylogenetically distinct groups. In addition, that all orthomyxo-like viruses currently sampled are segmented shows that this form of genome organization is an ancient innovation in this group.",

Clearly, the monophyletic nature of vertebrate-specific viruses implies that have had a long-term evolutionary association with vertebrate hosts. Also, although some invertebrate viruses appear basal to vertebrate viruses, the distance between them are often substantial and phylogenetic relationships are not always stable.

Meta-transcriptomic data provide a ready means to determine what viruses are present in which hosts and allows a simple measure of virus abundance. Equally important is that the meta-transcriptomic sampling of an increasing number and diverse set of hosts has fundamentally changed the view of the host structure of major virus groups. Before the metagenomics revolution the virus diversity within a specific family was often dominated by particular host groups; so, for example, vertebrate, insect, and plant viruses often fell into distinct taxonomic groups. This has changed dramatically with meta-transcriptomics. For example, the family Totiviridae, previously thought to be largely associated with fungi, are now commonly found in metazoa. Similarly, some previously defined families of plant viruses, such as the Tombusviridae and Luteoviridae, have expanded to include viruses from arthropods, nematodes, molluscs, and protists (Shi et al., 2016a). Given such a complexity of host structure, combined with still very sparse sampling, it is dangerous to construct detailed ancestor-descendant relationships on the currently available data. For example, arthropods were initially proposed to be the ancestral hosts of bunyaviruses (Marklewitz et al., 2015), although more divergent viruses in this group have now been discovered in other invertebrates, fungi, and protists (Akopyants et al., 2016, Shi et al., 2016a).",

However, given their complexity and the often great genetic distances between virus genomes, determining the precise sequence of cross-species transmission and co-divergence events that have shaped the evolutionary history of a particular group will undoubtedly be challenging and require a denser sampling of host taxa. Indeed, the greater diversity of hosts sampled, the more cases of species jumping we are likely to document (Geoghegan et al., 2017). Although the occurrence of virus-host co-divergence has long been suggested, meta-transcriptomic-based studies indicate that this may extend even further back in time than previously suspected. For example, one interpretation of the evolutionary relationships within the Narna\u2013Levi clade of RNA viruses is that there has been virus-host co-divergence since the \u03b1-proteobacteria became endosymbionts (Shi et al., 2016a).

Although the bulk sequencing of potential animal reservoir species as been proposed as a way to better predict of what types of virus may emerge in human populations in the future, and where this may occur, in reality disease emergence is a nuanced process that entails a complex interaction of ecological and genetic factors (Parrish et al., 2008, Plowright et al., 2017). Meta-transcriptomics tells us that there are so many viruses in nature that trying to establish which will ultimately appear in a new host from diversity sampling alone is almost certainly a futile exercise. This is apparent in the current vogue to study bat viruses. Since the emergence of SARS coronavirus in humans \u2013 a pathogen that has its ultimate ancestry in bats \u2013 sampling bat viruses as a means to determine which next might emerge in humans has received considerable attention (Smith and Wang, 2013). While these studies have made it clear that bats indeed harbor an enormous number of viruses (Anthony et al., 2017, Luis et al., 2013, Olival et al., 2017), at the same time they clearly show that the vast majority of these viruses have not jumped to humans.

Suffice to say, RNA virus genomes are more diverse, have more complex structures, and a wider range of lengths than previously anticipated. Although the reasons for this diversity and the birth of individual genes are uncertain, one process of undoubted importance is inter-specific recombination, including lateral gene transfer (Krupovic et al., 2012). This evidently occurs more frequently than previously anticipated, and can involve both structural and non-structural genes, with even evidence that cellular genes can be integrated into viral genomes (Shi et al., 2016a). Indeed, an emerging view is that RNA viruses experience as complex processes of genome evolution as in DNA organisms. To better determine the evolutionary processes that shape viral genome structures, and hence how new viruses are created, it is important to use the new wealth of meta-transcriptomic data to carefully determine the frequency, pattern and history of gene duplications and losses, lateral gene transfers, and genomic rearrangements; combined, these will provide a more complete picture of genome-scale evolutionary processes obtained.",

Families of RNA viruses were generally thought to be characterized by a specific segmentation type, such as the presence/absence of segmented genomes or certain number of segments. However, segmentation no longer appears to be a strong taxon defining trait, and a combination of segmented and unsegmented genomes has now been observed within families of RNA viruses. An informative example is presented by the Flaviviridae and their relatives \u2013 the so-called \u2018flavi-like\u2019 viruses. Traditionally, flaviviruses were considered to be small (\u223c10 kb) unsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses that infected vertebrates; if invertebrates were involved then it was as vectors of these viruses among vertebrates, particularly mosquitoes and ticks (Simmonds et al., 2017b). Meta-transcriptomic studies have radically changed this view, including the identification of a large number of \u2018insect-specific\u2019 flaviviruses (Bolling et al., 2015, May et al., 2013, Qin et al., 2014, Shi et al., 2016b). Indeed, flavi-like viruses now appear to be a group of predominantly invertebrate RNA viruses with the potential to have very large genomes (\u223c26 kb) and which can be arranged in four or five segments (Ladner et al., 2016, Qin et al., 2014). Even more dramatic is that some of these flavi-like viruses appear to comprise distinct virus particles such that they are multipartite, a form of genome organization that was previously thought to be the exclusive domain of plant RNA viruses (Ladner et al., 2016).",

Although there is still debate as to the cause of this size limit, it is tempting to think that it reflects the high rate of RNA virus evolution and the mutational burden this entails, particularly since single-stranded DNA viruses, that also mutate rapidly, similarly possess small genomes (Holmes, 2009). Of course, it is possible that the length profiles of viruses will radically change with increased sampling, and an RNA virus with the length and complexity of a large double-strand DNA virus stands represents something of a virological holy grail.",

An informative example is provided by the Mononegavirales \u2013 an order of viruses originally characterized by unsegmented negative-sense RNA genomes and which has recently been the subject of considerable attention from the ICTV. Although use of the taxonomic term \u2018Mononegavirales\u2019 is growing in popularity, it now makes little sense in its strict literal definition as RdRp-based phylogenies show that this group contains segmented viruses, so that they no longer fulfil the criterion of possess a single (\u2019mono\u2019) negative-sense RNA molecule (Li et al., 2015), with genome segmentation evolving a number of times independently. Similar stories can be told for the Flaviviridae and the Totiviridae that were originally defined based on single segment but are now found to be closely related to viruses with multiple segments (Li et al., 2015, Qin et al., 2014, Sasaya et al., 2002), and the Partitiviridae and Picobirnaviridae that were thought to be bisegmented yet now include viruses containing one to six segments.

Although this is a common problem in classification, and in large part reflects the fact that some families have a much longer evolutionary history than others, it is especially prominent in RNA viruses. The reason for such imbalance again points to the sometimes shaky criteria used for viral classification. For example, the \u2018Hepe-Virga\u2019 clade (also known as the alpha-like supergroup) are relatively closely related in RdRp phylogenies yet the ICTV divides them into one order (Tymovirales), eight families (the Virgaviridae, Togaviridae, Bromoviridae, Closteroviridae, Endoranviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Hepeviridae, and Benyviridae), and three floating genera (Negevirus, Idaeovirus, and Cilevirus). Although this clade does possess some divergent genome structures, with differences in segmentation, ORF arrangement, genome length, and even the genome sense, its RdRp diversity is no larger than that of reoviruses that are still classified as a single family thanks to a stable genome plan. In other cases these taxonomic differences appear to be largely arbitrary. For example, in the newly established order Bunyavirales (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/), the Jonviridae, Feraviridae and Phasmaviridae are defined as separate families, although they form a single RdRp cluster whose diversity is significantly smaller than those of some individual families, such as the Phenuiviridae and the Peribunyaviridae. Although there have been clear improvements in making virus classifications more compatible with underlying phylogenetic relationships, there are notable exceptions. For example, the Togaviridae comprise two genera, Alphavirus and Rubivirus, that do not share common ancestry in phylogenies of either their replicase or structural proteins. At the very least proposals for individual taxonomic groups should be monophyletic, which is not always the case (Kuhn et al., 2013).",

First, the boundaries we draw to mark higher virus taxa are inherently arbitrary, rather than reflecting a hard evolutionary \u2018rule\u2019, and we should not expect nature to provide neat boundaries for classification. As noted above, the gaps apparent in many phylogenetic trees will likely be filled by newly discovered lineages as our sampling becomes more extensive. Hence, phylogenetic gaps do not necessary reflect a fundamental evolutionary process, but are likely an artefact of sparse and inadequate sampling. Indeed, from a metagenomic perspective virus species will simply be points in phylogenetic space, and viruses \u2018species\u2019 differ fundamentally from those in diploid outcrossing animals in which the term has a real biological meaning. At a lower taxonomic level, using genetic distance cut-offs to determine taxonomic differences within virus species, particularly genotypes, is also fraught with difficulties as different schemes are used in different viruses and all such rules of distance may break down if there is extensive rate variation among taxa and if our sampling is biased toward specific geographic locations.",

Because of high levels of sequence divergence it is necessarily the case that most deep (particularly inter-family) virus phylogenies are based on the analysis of RdRp alone. However, given the dynamic nature of virus genome organization, particularly the occurrence of lateral gene transfer, it is certain that in many cases the phylogeny of the RdRp will not match that of the virus genome as a whole. For example, the Luteoviridae are currently defined based on the relatedness of the structural proteins, although the replicase sequences of these viruses do not form a monophyletic group. Unfortunately, phylogenetic analyses of other genes, particularly those that encode structural proteins, often present an unsurmountable challenge for sequence-based analytical methods because of the huge sequence distances involved (Holmes, 2009, Zanotto et al., 1996). It is therefore an inconvenient truth that while phylogenies based on the RdRp can sometimes accurately depict the evolutionary history of that gene, they do not necessary reflect that of the virus as a whole. Although there are pros and cons to using either replicase or structural genes to determine phylogenetic relationships, the fact that they often give contrasting views of evolutionary history clearly complicates virus classification.",

As well as revealing an abundance of new virus taxa, and determining the evolutionary processes that have shaped this diversity, it is undoubtedly the case that viruses exist in hosts that have not been screened for RNA viruses or that are so divergent in sequence that they cannot readily be detected by standard homology-based methods (such as Blast) or included in phylogenetic analyses. If the nature of this dark matter can be resolved it will surely shed new light on the ultimate origins of viruses as well as their deep phylogenetic relationships. The situation is particularly acute in the case of the archaea in which only a single putative RNA virus has been described to date (Bolduc et al., 2012), and which in large part may reflect our current inability to identify viruses that possess highly divergent genome sequences. It is therefore of critical importance to perform unbiased metagenomics surveys of prokaryotic taxa that have not been examined to date, followed by novel bioinformatics analyses that are able to accurately identify viruses and reveal their phylogenetic relationships. This will entail the characterization of the unknown biodiversity of RNA viruses in prokaryotes and basal eukaryotes and, in parallel, developing and utilizing new computational tools to robustly extract sequence information from highly divergent genome sequences. Similarly, the increasingly frequent detection of recombination and lateral gene transfer also poses a major challenge to current phylogenetic protocols and may require a new computational tool-kit (Iranzo et al., 2016, Koonin and Dolja, 2014).",

            "text": "Our knowledge of the evolutionary processes that have generated the diversity of the virosphere has been strongly skewed by a focus on those viruses that act as agents of disease in economically important animals and plants and those that can be easily cultured. Importantly, recent work has shown that animals harbor enormous uncharacterized viral diversity, only some of which has been associated with disease. However, these viruses still only reflect a tiny proportion of those in nature and therefore provide an incomplete picture of the major processes of virus ecology and evolution. Key questions for future research that can be addressed with the new wealth of meta-transcriptomic data include (i) determining the flow of viruses between host taxa and the processes that shape virus ecosystems; (ii) revealing the mechanisms of long-term virus macroevolution, particularly lineage birth and death, and (iii) revealing the mechanisms and evolutionary processes that structure viral genomes. Rather than simply surveying biodiversity and classifying, the goal for the future should be to perform more ecology-focused studies to reveal fundamental patterns and processes. It is critical that studies of virus diversity evolution shape our attempts to classify these infectious agents, rather than classification schemes guiding how we think that viruses have evolved. Finally, we contend that is perhaps premature to construct inflexible and overly hierarchical classification schemes for RNA viruses when we have clearly sampled so little of what is there in nature. The new age of virus discovery will undoubtedly provide many new challenges for the science of virus classification.",
