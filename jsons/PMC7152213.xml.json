            "text": "\nWhen discussing drugs and drug development it is usual for one to think of all-organic molecules rather than those containing a metal/main-group element. While it is estimated that about 70% of organic drugs are bioinspired or are derivatives of natural products,1 putative metal-based drugs are normally synthetic. Metal-based drugs can offer considerable advantages over all-organic drug molecules in that they may function as carriers of otherwise unstable organic drugs (the so-called Trojan horse strategy), offer opportunities for controlled release of drugs, or, crucially, may in fact be the key to therapeutic benefit. Despite the dominance of organic molecules in chemotherapy, it is of interest that modern chemotherapy is widely acknowledged to have begun with the work of Paul Ehrlich who investigated the efficacy of arsenic compounds for the treatment of, for example, African trypanosominasis.2 While it is evident that metals featured prominently in traditional medicine of various societies, their adoption in contemporary medicine is not as well developed as it should be. This contention is supported by the fact that several metal-based drugs have dominant roles in modern chemotherapy. Perhaps most notable among these are cisplatin and second-generation platinum complexes that are used successfully for the treatment of various types of cancers. Other prominent elements include vanadium for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, gold for severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis, and more directly relevant to the present chapter, arsenic for the treatment of a specific form of leukemia, antimony for the treatment of the tropical disease leishmaniasis, and bismuth for peptic and duodenal ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori. While it is of some interest that specific metals appear to target specific diseases, a multitude of metal compounds are continuously being evaluated for efficacy against the full range of human afflictions and the literature describing this development is steadily growing. As such, a comprehensive literature is emerging. Two books dedicated to the topic \u2018metal-based drugs\u2019 have appeared in recent years.3\n,\n4 These are complemented by numerous reviews with recent examples focusing on general aspects,5\n,\n6 metal complexes for the treatment of cancer, which no doubt is the endeavor attracting most attention in this context,7, 8, 9, 10 tropical diseases,11 diabetes,12 and for enzyme inhibition.13 Reflecting growing interest, reviews are also available describing the development of organometallic compounds as therapeutic agents14, 15, 16 and, intriguingly, of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) which may function as drug carriers, that is a new type of drug delivery system.17\n,\n18\n",

Once gallium gets into the cell, it exerts its antiproliferative effects by inhibiting ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase (RDR). Due to the competitive binding between Ga3+ and Fe3+, gallium not only affects intracellular iron availability, but also interacts directly with RDR, displacing iron from the enzyme.32\n,\n37\n,\n38 Tumor cells are more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of RDR inhibition than normal cells because of the increased need of deoxynucleotide triphosphates for proliferation, and decreased adaptability and low responsiveness to regulatory signals. Thus, the enzyme has long been considered an excellent target for cancer chemotherapy. Owing to the benefits outlined above as well due to their better antiproliferative properties, greater bioavailabilities, and suitability for oral administration,39 two compounds, the aforementioned gallium maltolate (2)40, 41, 42 and tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (3)43\n,\n44, were selected for further evaluation. As with the structure of 2, 3 features an octahedral geometry with a mer distribution of donor phenoxido-O atoms (Figure 1). Compound 3 has already finished phase I clinical trials and is expected to enter the second phase. Even though the antitumor effects of gallium compounds were demonstrated sometime ago, the optimum schedule of administration still needs to be determined.",

The antimicrobial effect of gallium relates to its biochemical similarity to iron. As the ionic radii and other properties of Ga3 + and Fe3 + ions are very similar, as mentioned above, Ga3 + can substitute for Fe3 + in iron-dependent biological processes such as bacterial iron scavenging and transport systems as well as enzyme synthesis pathways.49\n,\n54 In fact, Ga3 + is taken up preferentially over Fe3 + by some bacteria as it binds to ferric sites in transferrin and is also preferentially taken up by mononuclear phagocytes at sites of inflammation.21\n,\n55 However, unlike Fe3 +, Ga3 + is not reducible to the divalent form under physiological conditions. This precludes its participation in crucial bacterial iron-dependent DNA synthetic pathways, thereby accounting for gallium's antimicrobial activity.",

While the general phobia against the heavier elements might be partly responsible for this inactivity, just like Ga3 +, In3 + is known to interact with transferrins, iron-binding blood plasma glycoproteins that control the level of free iron in biological fluids, thereby providing a likely mechanism for transport of In3 + across a cell membrane. When 111In-labeled compounds are administered with weakly bound ligands or in acidic solutions, more than 95% of the In3 + is found to bind to proteins, mainly transferrin.66 This is crucial as when a transferrin protein loaded with iron encounters a transferrin receptor (TFR) on the surface of a cell, it binds to it and is transported into the cell in a vesicle by receptor-mediated endocytosis suggesting that indium-loaded transferrins can similarly transport In3 +.67\n,\n68 Although In3 + transferrin binds the TFR as well as diferric transferrin, the transport of In3 + across the cell membrane is much slower than in the case of Ga3 +. However, In3 + still tends to accumulate in tissues that have high levels of TFR, and it seems likely that transferrin is a mediator for the delivery of In3 + to tumors.69 In any case, it is clear that indium(III) compounds will use the first steps of the classical iron pathway after reaching the blood stream and this may have important consequences in relation to the toxicological or radiopharmaceutical roles of these compounds.",

It has been reported that CDK1 inhibitors effectively arrest tumor cell growth prompting recent interest in the discovery and development of new CDK1 inhibitors.85 In 2002, germanium oxide (GeO2) was found to block cell-cycle progression at G2 phase for Chinese hamster ovary cells.

In cancer cells, which cannot utilize oxygen, which actually appear to be oxygen sensitive, the presence of an oxygen catalyst could have deleterious effects and likely therapeutic value.91 The exact anticancer mechanism of these compounds remains unclear, however. A recent study that evaluated the cytotoxicity of hydroxyl derivatives of 12 suggested these may possess DNA-binding specificity, like cisplatin, to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.92\n",

Since there are two primary modes of apoptosis, metal-induced apoptosis is thought to be initiated intracellularly with the mitochondria being most pertinent in mediating apoptosis via metal-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS).109 In the following, brief summaries of studies are given where potential activity was coupled with investigations of possible mechanisms of action.",

Apoptotic death caused by 24 was also confirmed by the DNA fragmentation analysis, in which the typical pattern of the oligonucleosomal-sized fragments was also observed.

No changes in DNA integrity or in mitochondria function were observed. However, all of the organotin compounds surveyed were found to reduce ergosterol biosynthesis and caused severe damage to C. albicans cells compromising the cellular integrity, suggesting that the organotin complexes act on the cell membrane in view of cytoplasm leaking and cellular deformation. The study also indicated that the mechanism of action of these organotin compounds is similar to that of the azole drugs, such as ketoconazole or fluconazole, normally used in Candida infections.123\n",

This suggests that clinical trials of the combined regimen of 35 and PTX deserve to be performed in the refractory patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.160 Finally, recent research revealed that treatment with 35 reduces CD133 expression at transcriptional levels.161 CD133+ tumor cells are responsible for the initiation, propagation, and recurrence of tumors, which are highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy. As2O3 effectively induces CD133+ gall bladder carcinoma cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of CD133 is attenuated by the apoptotic effect of 35 on cells through activation of AKT (protein kinase B) signaling pathways. In summary, 35 effectively targets CD133 in gall bladder carcinoma, providing a new mechanism of 35-induced cell apoptosis and a better understanding of drug resistance in gall bladder carcinoma.161\n",

Accordingly, an investigation of the antitrypanosomal activity of antimony(III) thiosemicarbazone compounds was carried out, as exemplified by dichloridoantimony(III) N-2-chlorophenyl-2-acetylpyridinethiosemicarbazonate (40) (Figure 11\n) in which the immediate environment of the antimony(III) atom comprises N2S donor atoms of the uninegative tridentate ligand, and two chloride atoms which define a highly distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. Supramolecular association via Sb\u22efCl interactions (3.3 \u00c5) led to a polymeric chain and to a distorted octahedral coordination geometry (Figure 11) based on a mer-Cl3N2S donor set. In vitro trials revealed excellent inhibition action on Trypanosoma cruzi growth.169 The antitrypanosomal mechanism of action of the antimony(III) thiosemicarbazone compounds could be due to a synergistic effect involving both antimony(III) and the ligand molecules as the latter were also active in their own right and are thought provide the additional function as carriers of antimony(III) into the cell.168\n",

In early studies, the effects of antimony(III) drugs on glutathione homeostasis, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) monocyte cells were investigated.169 It was shown that when treated with antimony(III), THP-1 macrophage cells exhibited high levels of ROS and showed the early signs of apoptosis.169 Other studies showed that antimony trioxide (Sb2O3, 41) induces growth inhibition in patient-derived APL cell lines. It was demonstrated that treatment with 41 inhibits the growth of several malignant cell lines including those derived from both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.170 In most malignant cells tested, this growth inhibition is due to an increase in apoptosis as well as caspase activation, although in APL cells, 41 also induces a significant amount of granulocytic differentiation.170 When treated with 41, the signaling pathway of APL cells is associated with increased apoptosis as well as differentiation markers. Sb2O3-induced ROS correlated with increased apoptosis. In addition, 41 induces c-jun kinase (JNK) activity in APL cells and fibroblasts, and that an intact JNK signaling pathway involving SEK1 is important to 41-induced growth inhibition. Therefore, a complete SEK1/JNK pathway is required for 41 to induce activator protein-1 binding, which leads to apoptosis.171\n",

Gamide, acting through the cholecystokinin-2 receptor, is the major hormonal regulator of gastric acid secretion,181 and is a mitogen for normal gastric epithelium and some gastric cancers in vitro and in vivo.182 By contrast, progastrin and Ggly have little direct effect on gastric acidity but potentiate the effects of Gamide on acid secretion.183 The major physiological role of progastrin and Ggly is in the colon, as progastrin and Ggly stimulate proliferation of a colonic cell line in vitro and of the normal mucosa in vivo. Such nonamidated gastrins may also act as growth factors in colorectal cancer.184\n",

In all, 20 847 subjects received table salt containing 47, so that each subject received 30\u201350 mg of selenium per day for 8 years. The incidence of primary liver cancer was significantly reduced.194 It is thought that 47 induces apoptosis by generation of ROS through the mitochondrial-dependent pathway,195 based on studies into the 47-induced cell death in cervical carcinoma cells during 24 h of exposure in the HeLa Hep-2 cell line. Compound 47 produced time- and dose-dependent suppression of DNA synthesis and induced DNA damage which resulted in phosphorylation of histone H2A.X. Subsequently, 47 activated the p53-dependent pathway as evidenced by the appearance of phosphorylated p53 and accumulation of p21 in the treated cells. Concurrently, 47 activated the p38 pathway.195 The p53- and p38-dependent signaling led to the accumulation of the protein responsible for the generation of the Bax proapoptotic gene. It appears that mitochondria in 47-treated cells had their dynamics changed and initiated caspase-independent apoptosis, which was confirmed by the assay of caspase-3 activity. It was concluded that 47 induces caspase-independent apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells mostly by ROS-mediated activation of p53 and p38 pathways, and other selenite-mediated effects, in particular in mitochondria-specific cells, are also involved.195\n,\n196 The versatility of selenium is evidenced by the fact that amino acid analogs also display protective action against cancer.",

Disproportionation to the diselenide, the rate-determining step, is followed by reaction with H2O2 to produce a selenium-containing acid, either selenenic acid (53) or seleninic acid (54). Any 54 formed reacts with thiol to give 53 which, following dehydrogenation, regenerates 52, and so completes the catalytic cycle.203 Structure\u2013activity studies suggest that three key factors are important for efficacy, namely (1) the presence of a Se\u2013C(aromatic) bond that is sufficiently stable to prevent release of selenium, (2) the presence of a Se\u2013N bond that ensures activity akin to that exhibited by glutathione peroxidase, and (3) the presence of a N\u2014C(\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO) moiety to provide coordination donors to stabilize the various intermediates in the catalytic cycle.203\n",

What is known is that during deiodination a selenenyl iodide intermediate is formed that reacts with a thiol cofactor.207 The selenium compound 1-methyl-3H-imidazole-2-selenone (57), an analog of the sulfur drug Methimazole\u00ae, effectively inhibits lactoperoxidase-catalyzed reactions relating to oxidation, in a mechanism likely to involve the reduction of H2O2, and iodination.208 A chemical reason has been proposed to account for the differences between the sulfur and selenium antithyroid drugs, namely based on the greater nucleophilicity of selenium.209 While the sulfur analog of 57 exists primarily as a thione, the greater nucleophilicity of selenium sees a significant contribution of zwitterionic 58 to the overall electronic structure. Thus, while 57 is readily oxidized to the diselenide, important for the inhibition thyroid hormone synthesis, the same is not true for the sulfur drugs.

Sir Alexander Fleming, in 1932, established that 63 was active in penicillin-insensitive bacteria and, by contrast, penicillin was active in tellurium-insensitive bacteria.215 Despite this selectivity, the evaluation of tellurium as a therapeutic agent did not really progress significantly from that point in time, perhaps owing to perceived problems with toxicity.216\n,\n217 As mentioned above on several occasions, this should not be a deterrent in evaluating tellurium compounds for therapeutic potential.

The molecular structure comprises a pentacoordinate tellurium atom coordinated by two oxygen atoms derived from the chelating alkoxide ligand and three chloride atoms (Figure 18\n).

When patients with advanced cancer were treated with 64 in phase I clinical trials, it was observed that the increased production and secretion of certain cytokines resulted in a dominance and decrease in TH1 and TH2 responses, respectively. The effects of 64 on IL-10 might explain the mechanism by which it sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy. While Stat3 is the main target of IL-10, it is known that to a lesser extent PI3-kinase can be activated by this cytokine. As the upregulation of survivin gene expression in malignant cells requires the convergence of constitutive Stat3 activation and PI3K/Akt signaling, in IL-10-producing tumors it is feasible that inhibition of IL-10 ultimately results in the inhibition of pStat3 and subsequent repression of survivin. Supporting this proposal is the observation that 64 inhibits survivin protein expression in myeloma cells.220\n",

Despite the emergence of other drugs, lithium salts continue to be used as the first-line treatment against acute mania, and used prophylactically for recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Clinically, lithium salts can also be used as an adjunctive with mood-stabilizing drugs, antidepressants, and antipsychotics in order optimize their therapeutic benefits.

Based on pharmacological and gene manipulation studies, the main mechanisms of action for lithium appear to be the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated signaling. These lead to pathways for enhanced cell survival and alteration of various downstream effectors.233 Lithium also contributes to calcium homeostasis by inhibiting N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated calcium influx and by suppressing calcium-dependent activation of proapoptotic signaling pathways.234 Lithium has also been implicated in a recently identified process touted as a novel mechanism for inducing autophagy, that is, by inhibiting phosphoinositol phosphatases lithium decreases inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentrations. Whatever the precise mechanism/mechanisms of action, it is clear that therapeutic doses of lithium are able to defend neuronal cells against diverse forms of death insults.

It is evident that these compounds present a diverse range of clinical outcomes, with certain types of cancer being treated by arsenic and gallium-containing species, leishmaniasis by antimony compounds, gastric ulcers by bismuth formulations, and neurodegenerative disease by lithium salts. Despite these current applications, it is acknowledged that precise molecular structures, let alone mechanisms of action, are often not known for compounds that entered into the pharmacopoeia before the more stringent regulations of modern times. Perhaps with greater knowledge of structure and mechanism of action, more effective drugs can be designed. As clearly indicated in the known crystal structures of many of the biologically active molecules described herein, supramolecular aggregation through hypervalent metal\u22efX (donor atom) interactions is apparent. This indicates a possible and consistent mode of action whereby the metal center in a putative drug can anchor onto a target biomolecule through such interactions. Great potential is obvious for all main-group element compounds as therapeutic windows might be available for elements once dismissed as being too toxic to provide pharmacological benefit, with the obvious outstanding example being that of arsenic. This change in paradigm obligates further research into elements that have been neglected owing to perceived problems with toxicity. However, such research should be reliant on complementary in vivo studies and include a quest to discover biological targets and mechanisms \u2013 studies proving \u2018potential\u2019 by in vitro studies are often incomplete and ambiguous. A full range of disease can be tackled, that is, from cancer to microbial disease. With the latter, overcoming drug resistance may be possible using \u2018out of the ordinary\u2019 main-group elements with no known biological function. Inspirations from traditional medicine should not be ignored, as after all Chinese traditional medicine inspired studies into therapeutic arsenic. With an emphasis on molecular compounds, nanoparticles of main-group elements have not been covered to any significant extent in the present survey and this remains an almost unchartered frontier deserving of greater investigation.235\n",
