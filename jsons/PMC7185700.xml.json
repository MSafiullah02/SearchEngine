Some of these atypical shapes improve the aerodynamic performances of the buildings themselves and bring economic benefits to the developers. For example, the aerodynamic forces and wind excitations of tall buildings may be effectively minimised by tapered shapes and chamfered corners [11], [18], [21], [19]. In addition, certain building forms have proved useful in achieving acceptable wind conditions at the pedestrian level around buildings [5], [10], [22]. In contrast to the influence of novel building forms on the aerodynamic behaviour of high-rise buildings, which has long been a topic for academic research and hence been thoroughly investigated, their influence on the pedestrian-level wind field has yet to be systematically studied. Considering the importance of the pedestrian-level wind fields in a tropical metropolis, it is necessary to analyse the impact of novel building forms on the pedestrian-level wind field in order to select appropriate building forms to produce acceptable pedestrian-level urban wind fields.",

            "text": "Wind nuisance in cities is typically caused by tall buildings, as they frequently produce unacceptable, even dangerous, windy conditions at the pedestrian level [14], [15]. Although high wind speeds are typically considered as the cause of pedestrian discomfort, wind-related environmental issues in cities such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New Delhi have switched from dangerously high wind speeds to undesirable low wind speeds [20], [4], [6]. Undesirable low wind speeds are a result of excessive sheltering by closely-spaced tall buildings, built in such a way to cope with the high land prices and scarcity of available lands in cities. Because developers do not want to lose usable space, there is a reluctance to reduce building dimensions so as to provide more space for air to circulate. Newly developed building forms may be an alternative solution to improve pedestrian-level wind conditions in cities without sacrificing the useable space of a building. However, some common building forms used in cities impede air circulations by obstructing breezeways at the pedestrian level. Hong Kong is a classic example of a city where the use of inappropriate building forms has led to a deterioration of the urban wind environment. For example, closely-spaced tall buildings and bulk podium structures in Hong Kong substantially reduce wind penetration into the city and consequently generate undesirable low wind speeds at the pedestrian level [26], [16], [20]. Low wind speeds that allow air pollutants to remain near the ground also continue to exacerbate the air pollution in Hong Kong [23]. Widespread stagnant air can be favourable to the spread of air-borne pathogens such the SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and hence is a threat to the public health [27]. Moreover, mean wind speeds smaller than 1.5 m s\u22121, the minimum mean wind speed required by the Air Ventilation Assessment stipulated in Hong Kong, can cause outdoor thermal discomfort for pedestrians, especially in the hot summer months [16], [3].",

            "text": "The \u2018lift-up\u2019 building design is a potential solution for enhancing urban air ventilation in the city. The main structure of a \u2018lift-up\u2019 building is elevated from the ground by individually, or a combination of, columns, shear walls, and a central core (Fig. 1\n). The main structure elevated from the ground is known as \u2018lift-up\u2019 floors, and the ground area under the elevated main structure is referred to as the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area. The main benefit of the open space between the ground and the \u2018lift-up\u2019 floors is to minimize obstruction to wind flow at the ground level to enhance wind circulation at the pedestrian level [7]. In addition, the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area can be used as a recreational area, parking area, or a pathway to access other buildings or areas. The \u2018lift-up\u2019 design is, however, not widely adopted for buildings due to unacceptable or even dangerous high wind speeds found in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area [1], [5], [17]. These high wind speeds are a result of accelerated wind flows through narrowing openings, which connect positive and negative pressures on the windward and leeward sides of a building, respectively [17]. However, the accelerated wind flows in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 areas may be favourable in achieving the minimum acceptable wind speeds in cities where undesirable low wind speeds prevail. In fact [25], have demonstrated that the addition of \u2018lift-up\u2019 floors to a single building, a building array, and building(s) with podium structure(s) can considerably increase the wind circulation around the building and is effective in achieving outdoor thermal comfort even under the prevailing low wind speed conditions in Hong Kong. However [25], employed a single core size thus no results are available to quantify the influence of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions on the pedestrian-level wind field. This lack of understanding on influential parameters of \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions prevents designers to adopt the \u2018lift-up\u2019 design to buildings in cities. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the influence of \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions on the pedestrian-level wind environment, so as to be used to guide designers to adopt a \u2018lift-up\u2019 design for buildings to improve pedestrian-level wind conditions in a modern city such as Hong Kong. A series of wind tunnel tests were conducted using 9 isolated building models with different dimensions of central \u2018lift-up\u2019 core. Albeit being the simplest building arrangement, isolated buildings are (1) able to generate less complex flow conditions than in a group of buildings, and (2) capable of producing all important flow features in the surrounding wind environment [1], [8], [12] thus selected for the current study. On the other hand, a central core design would minimize the influence on wind conditions in the lift-up area, the main concern of this study, compared to rows of columns or shear walls at the perimeter of the building. In the wind tunnel tests, the wind speeds at the pedestrian level near lift-up buildings were measured and subsequently compared with wind speeds near a control building model (i.e., a building without the \u2018lift-up\u2019 design) with similar dimensions in order to identify flow features in pedestrian-level wind field modified by the \u2018lift-up\u2019 design.",

The WWTF is a closed-return type boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) and has two parallel test sections named as \u201chigh speed\u201d and \u201clow speed\u201d with different dimensions and operating wind speeds. The wind tunnel tests were carried out in the \u201clow speed\u201d section, which has a test section of 5 m \u00d7 4 m (width x height) and maximum operating wind speed of 10 m s\u22121. The approaching wind speed and turbulence intensity profiles were simulated by arranging roughness elements and spires in the upstream of the flow development section, which is 41 m long. Fig. 2\ndisplays the measured mean wind speed and turbulence intensity profiles at the centre of the turntable. The mean wind speed profile followed the power law wind profile model with an exponent of 0.11 (equation (1a)). The mean wind speed (U) and the longitudinal turbulence intensity (I\nu), which is calculated as in equation (1b), measured at the 100 mm height at the centre of the turntable were 6.3 m s\u22121 and 9.5%, respectively.(1a)U(z)=Uref(zzref)0.11\n(1b)Iu(z)=\u03c3u(z)u\u00af(z)\n",

The two types of sensors together covered a rectangular area spanning 375 mm in the upstream direction, 1425 mm in the downstream direction, and 600 mm in the lateral directions from the centre of the building model. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the resolution of the Irwin sensor measurement grid was fine close to the building model and became coarse beyond a distance of 525 mm downstream of the building. The smallest spacing of the Irwin sensor measurement grid was 75 mm in the longitudinal direction and 100 mm in the lateral direction and satisfied the minimum separation distances proposed by Ref. [24]. The minimum spacing of Kanomax anemometers was 30 mm in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. Both the Irwin sensors and Kanomax anemometers were operated via a common computer to record wind speeds data synchronously. The wind speed measurements at 10 mm height of both for Irwin sensors and Kanomax anemometers were recorded for 135 s at a sampling frequency of 400 Hz for the Irwin sensors and 10 Hz for the Kanomax anemometers.

The K\u00afHWS value corresponding to the control building (CB) is marked by a red dashed line in Fig. 8 for the purpose of comparison. In general, all the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings have larger K\u00afHWS values than the control building (K\u00afHWS=1.405) whereas the K\u00afHWS values of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings vary considerably with the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height and area. In fact, the K\u00afHWS values rapidly increase with the \u2018lift-up\u2019 height but decrease slightly with increasing core area. The increase of the K\u00afHWS values with the core height is attributed to the accelerated wind flows in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 areas with taller cores where more space is available for the wind flow to pass through. On the other hand, significant wind blockage induced by shorter cores with larger areas, marginally reduces the K\u00afHWS values. Therefore, an appropriate combination of core height and size would maximise the accelerated wind flows near \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings as observed in model M6. The model M6, which has a taller core and a moderate core area (h = 9 m, AP = 25%) has recorded the largest K\u00afHWS value of 1.495 among all the tested \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings in this study However, if the given objective of the design is to minimize the formation of HWS zones near \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings, then the designer should select a short and bulky central core for the building such as in model M7.",

Except for models M2 and M3, K\u00afLWS values in the ULWS zones of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings are smaller than in the ULWS zones of the control building (CB). The higher K\u00afLWS value of the CB than of \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings is attributed to the difference between the LWS zones formed upstream of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings and the CB. In general, there are two LWS zones formed upstream of the CB, which is a building without \u2018lift-up\u2019 design, one next to the windward side, and the other far upstream of the building [20]. However, the LWS zone far upstream is not visible for the CB in Fig. 4(b) because it was formed outside the measurement area owing to the strong backflow. On the other hand, leakage of the downwash flow through the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area has weakened the backflow, and subsequently forms the second LWS zone in the far upstream of measurement area, as shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the wind flow through the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area not only creates the second LWS zone but also controls the K\u00afLWS values in the ULWS zones. Higher wind blockages induced by shorter cores with larger areas tend to stagnate more air on the windward side of the building and produced smaller K\u00afLWS values as observed for model M7. \u2018Lift-up\u2019 buildings with taller cores with smaller AP values, on the other hand, produce higher K\u00afLWS in the ULWS zone such as in the M2 and M3 cases. The \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height has a more influence on the K\u00afLWS values in the ULWS zone than the core area, as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 11\nfurther substantiates the greater influence of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height on the K values and corresponding areas of the ULWS zone. Taller \u2018lift-up\u2019 cores reduce considerably the size of areas with lower K values and are sometimes able to eliminate undesirable low wind speeds completely in the upstream direction of a \u2018lift-up\u2019 building. No areas with K < 0.4 found in the ULWS zone for model M3 is an example of the effectiveness of taller cores with smaller core areas to minimize stagnated air in the upstream of \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings.",

The K\u00afLWS value cannot be calculated for the control building (CB) as no LWS area (i.e., an area with K < 0.7) is formed next to the leeward sides of the CB (Fig. 5). The absence of DNLWS zone of the CB is attributed to the steady horseshoe vortex generated by the strong downwash along the front face of the CB. The steady horseshoe vortex of the CB wraps firmly around the base of the building and prevents the formation of a DNLWS zone on the leeward side of the CB [20]. The horseshoe vortices in each of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings are, on the other hand, weaker because of the downwash flow passes through the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area. As a result, an LWS zone appear next to the leeward side of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings, which have smaller K\u00afLWS values than the K\u00afLWS values obtained in the pedestrian-level wind field on the leeward side of the CB. In fact, the calculated K\u00afLWS value of the CB is 0.85 and thus it does not appear in Fig. 12, which has a set maximum K\u00afLWS value of 0.7. In addition, Fig. 12 reveals that the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height further reduces the K\u00afLWS values in the DNLWS zone. It is reasonable to link the reduced K\u00afLWS values to the increase of downwash passing through the taller \u2018lift-up\u2019 areas, which further weakens the horseshoe vortex generation.",

It should be noticed that Fig. 13 does not show data related to the control building (CB) as its K values in the DNLWS are not less than 0.7. In other words, Fig. 13 depicts that the most of \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings, generally, corresponds to smaller K values (such as K < 0.4) when comparing to higher K values (K > 0.7) corresponding to the CB. Moreover, AP\ncum values increase considerably with the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height, especially when K values are smaller than 0.6. Furthermore, a distinct increasing trend of AP\ncum is identified with the increase of \u2018lift-up\u2019 core area from the smallest (AP = 9%) to moderate (AP = 25%) values but such an increasing trend is interrupted as the core area increases from moderate to the largest (AP = 49%). In fact, larger core areas (AP = 49%) are linked to the smaller AP\ncum value under the condition that 0.7 < K < 0.4. The decrease of AP\ncum with larger core areas may have resulted from the UNLWS zone shifted inside the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area rather than stretched into the downstream direction of the building. Therefore, a part of the DNLWS zone within the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area is not counted in the calculation of AP\ncum (see Fig. 6). The inward expansion of the LWS zone is further analysed in the section focusing on the distribution of wind speeds in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area.",

Consequently, knowledge of the wind speed distributions in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area provides the guidance for positioning the building entrances in order to prevent the high wind speed from worrying pedestrians. Low wind speeds, eventually lead to inadequate air ventilations to cause outdoor thermal discomfort of people in \u2018lift-up\u2019 areas.

For example, shorter cores with smaller core areas create larger high wind speed zones, which cover a major portion of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area. On the other hand, low wind speeds prevail in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 areas corresponding to the cores with the largest area (AP = 49%). Moreover, the cores with the smallest area (AP = 9%) results in the low wind speed zone having a width approximately equal to the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core but in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 areas where the cores have larger areas (AP = 25% and 49%) then the low wind speed zone is wider than the cores. The low wind speed zones at the leeward side of the largest core (AP = 49%), on the other hand, expand laterally rather than stretch downstream, which could explain the high K\u00afLWS values and smaller AP\ncum values corresponding to the buildings with the largest core, as seen in Fig. 12, Fig. 13. The \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions not only modify the pedestrian-level wind speed distribution but also define the location where the maximum and minimum wind speeds are observed. The maximum wind speeds in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area of model M1 are found near the upstream corners of the building, while the maximum wind speeds in model M6 exist on the lateral sides of the core. In the extreme case, the location of the maximum wind speed may lie outside of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area, as seen in the models M8 and M9, which have larger core areas.",

The acceptable wind speeds at a given location depend on several factors such as the prevailing wind speed, air temperature, physical activities, and clothing [13]. Since the scope of the present study is limited to determining the effects of wind speeds on pedestrian comfort and safety, only a criterion based on the mean wind speed is presented to select appropriate \u2018lift-up\u2019 dimensions. The selected criterion considers K values within the range of 0.7\u20131.3 as acceptable wind conditions by assuming K < 0.7 indicates undesirable low wind speeds that cause the outdoor thermal discomfort and K > 1.3 results in pedestrian discomfort due to high wind speeds. Since residential building sites usually have areas allocated for kids' playing areas, or sitting areas, the less perturbation concept, and hence the selected acceptable K value range, is reasonable and practical for the building design evaluation. However, the selected comfort criterion is arbitrary such as the criterion used by Ref. [22] and only intends to demonstrate how to select appropriate lift-core dimensions based on a given comfort criterion. To achieve a higher accuracy in determining \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions and to compatible with the prevailing wind conditions, it is advisable to employ a comprehensive comfort criterion together with meteorological data rather than a simple criterion similar used in the current study.",

            "text": "In the present study, the pedestrian-level wind fields around \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings were systematically investigated through a series of wind tunnel tests. The influence of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions was determined by testing 9 \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings with different \u2018lift-up\u2019 core heights and core areas. The investigation used mean wind speeds measured at the 10 mm height (i.e., 2 m height in full scale), and the normalized mean wind speed ratio (K) to analyse: (1) the overall features of the pedestrian-level wind environment around the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings, (2) the distribution of high and low wind speeds near the \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings, and (3) the distribution of wind speeds in the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area. Moreover, a control building of the same overall dimensions but without a \u2018lift-up\u2019 core was tested using the same wind-tunnel setup, and the results were compared to identify any wind conditions resulting from the \u2018lift-up\u2019 configuration. Based on the wind tunnel test results, the following conclusions are drawn:(1)A \u2018lift-up\u2019 building modifies its surrounding wind environment differently than a building without \u2018lift-up\u2019 design (the control building) with similar dimensions. The flow modifications include (1) increases in area and magnitude of high wind speed (HWS) zones, (2) the formation of a pronounced low wind speed (LWS) zone on the leeward side of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 building, and (3) a weakened LWS zone in the upstream direction of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 building. All of these modifications are the direct results of the wind flow that passes through the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area. Therefore, it is possible to maintain the desired wind environment near a \u2018lift-up\u2019 building by controlling the amount of wind flow passing through the \u2018lift-up\u2019 area or in other words, by adjusting the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions.(2)The area-averaged high wind speed ratio (the K\u00afHWS value) of a \u2018lift-up\u2019 building is considerably higher than of a building without \u2018lift-up\u2019 design due to the increases in size and intensity of the HWS areas. The K\u00afHWS value increases appreciably with the increase of \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height and slightly decreases with the increase of the core area. The effect of the \u2018lift-up\u2019 height is more pronounced for larger core areas (e.g. AP = 49%) than for smaller core areas such as AP = 9%. Consequently, the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core dimensions that consist of a moderate core area with the tallest core height (AP = 25%, h = 9 m) would result in the highest accelerated wind flows near a \u2018lift-up\u2019 building.(3)The area averaged low wind speed ratio (the K\u00afLWS value) of the two low wind speed (LWS) zones around \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings are smaller than the K\u00afHWS value of a building \u2018lift-up\u2019 design. Moreover, the core area has a greater influence on generating smaller wind speeds in the upstream low wind speed (ULWS) zones than the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height. The \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height is effective in reducing the size of the ULWS areas of \u2018lift-up\u2019 buildings with larger cores areas (e.g. AP = 49%). The increase of both height and area of the core decreases wind speeds in the downstream near-field low wind speed (DNLWS) zone. However, K\u00afLWS values in the DNLWS zone are slightly increased for the largest core size of AP = 49% due to the expansion of the LWS area from the leeward side to the lateral sides of the core.(4)Appropriate lift-up dimensions can be determined by combining a wide range of wind speed data and meteorological wind data with a selection criterion, which depends on the required wind conditions so as to increase or decrease the wind speeds near lift-up buildings. As the wind tunnel test results indicate that the \u2018lift-up\u2019 core height is the most influential parameter, the most appropriate \u2018lift-up\u2019 design can be determined by first selecting the core height and then choosing a suitable core area from examining the wind tunnel test data.\n",
