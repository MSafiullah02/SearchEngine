Four patients had a QTc\uf0b3 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p=0.03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p<0.01) compared with those with QTc< 480 ms. At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had \u22651 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p=0.4). No patients showed \"R on T\" premature ventricular beats. Analysis of 24-hour QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability. Conclusion. Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases. Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 hours, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f proposed arrhythmic mechanism is the blockade of the KCNH2-encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel in the myocardial cells, which results in prolongation of ventricular repolarization and QT-interval (8).

No differences in terms of the median number of premature atrial or ventricular beats, or the presence of supraventricular tachycardia and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were observed between COVID-19 patients and controls (Table 2B ). The only run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (5 beats) was recorded in a 55-year old male patient, with a severe COVID-19 disease requiring high oxygen support. No patient and control showed \"R on T\" premature ventricular beats. Chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine have long been used in the treatment of malaria, and rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (6) (7) (8) . During the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, they have been suggested as potential treatments, based on in vitro investigations and unpublished clinical experience (3, 9) . The safety profile of chloroquine and analogs is favorable, although cardiovascular side effects are known, including hypotension, bradycardia, ECG changes such as QRS and QT-interval lengthening, and cardiac rhythm disturbance (8, (10) (11) . The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f repolarization rates, which are the predisposing factors of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias like \"R on T\" premature ventricular beats and torsade de pointes (12) . This effect may be amplified when multiple QT-prolonging drugs are used in combination.",

Nonetheless, they did not experience any arrhythmic complications during the hospital stay, like syncope or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Interestingly, patients with QTcinterval longer than 480 ms showed higher levels of transaminase. This is not a novelty since a prolonged QTc interval has been previously reported in patients with liver disease, due to electrolyte imbalance, autonomic nervous system dysfunction with a prevalence of sympathoadrenergic activity, and increased plasma concentrations of cytokines and vasopressors (16) . Given that our COVID-19 cohort did not show any dysionia during the ECG recordings, it is reasonable to believe that the inflammatory response and the cytokines release were more severe in patients with higher levels of transaminase. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), and interleukins IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, have a potential role in causing prolongation of the QT interval (17) .",

Limited data evaluating the safety of concurrent use of these medications are available. However, a higher risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, promoted by the druginduced QT-interval prolongation (4), is feared by the medical community. For this reason, electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring of patients treated with such combination therapy is warranted to detect excessive QT prolongation.",
