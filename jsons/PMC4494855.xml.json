            "text": "According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), natural disasters are classified as geophysical, metrological, hydrological, climatological and biological. These five disaster types encompass 12 disaster types and more than 30 sub-types. The 20th Century witnessed an increase in disaster losses, and this has continued its upward trend in the current Century. Climate change will increase the rate of increase of disasters, particularly those of meteorological origin. This is reflected in the fact that, of all natural hazards, floods are the most frequent and their impacts are also increasing 1\n,\n2. Though man-made disasters are also on the rise, the available global data is very limited to showing the trend over time; however, for the year 2012, CRED reported the occurrence of 188 technological disasters worldwide 1\n. It is also important to note that geographically, Asia is the continent with highest toll of natural disasters (e.g., in 2012, it accounted for 40.7% of disasters and 64.5% of disaster victims). Discrepancies in between number of events and victims, with Asia bearing the brunt of both events and losses, highlights the urgent need for more DRR efforts to be directed to Asian countries. It is also evident that despite the growing experience of hazard events, the growing incidence of disaster related losses indicates that the experience of disaster per se is not acting to trigger greater mitigation or preparedness activities in at-risk populations. While it is generally agreed that preparedness at an individual, community and organizational levels is important for ameliorating hazard impacts, the fact that growing incidence of and awareness of disasters is not driving increased preparedness directly suggests that pursuing the goal of increased preparedness in practice is an activity that needs guidance. In developed countries this guidance has emerged in the forms of behavior change theories that have been used to model preparedness. While a major pandemic has not occurred in recent decades, the occurrence of SARS, bird flu, swine flu, MERS and Ebola, for example, has drawn attention to a need for more community preparedness for large-scale public health and epidemic hazards. The management of all of these diseases includes a behavior change component. Since there is likely to be, at least at a national level in most countries, overlap of responsibility for managing natural hazards, health hazards and technological hazards, it becomes important to gain a better understanding of the utility of behavior change theories to contribute across a range of risk management domains.",

            "text": "This argument is an extension of the need to provide empirical support for the all-hazards capability of a theory. Many places around the world face threats from several hazards (e.g., locations in Japan and New Zealand need to be ready to deal with the consequences of earthquake, tsunami, typhoon and volcanic hazards) and places in California need to prepare for earthquake and wildfire hazards. Consequently, it is important to ascertain whether a given theory can predict preparedness for hazards that differ in the type of preparedness required. All hazards require people to undertake survival actions (e.g., storing food and water), but they can differ in their respective structural and planning requirements (e.g., the need to secure a house to its foundations for earthquakes versus a need to create defensible space zones around a property for wildfire). The utility of a theory is thus a function of its ability to predict a range of behavioral outcomes.",

Effective preparedness reduces vulnerability, increases mitigation level, enables timely and effective response to a disaster event and so shortens the recovery period from a disaster, and increases community resilience 3.",

That is, one reason for the discrepancy in the effectiveness of information-based change programs discussed above relates to whether agencies used an evidence-based approach or a more ad hoc approach to their risk communication programs. It is also possible to hypothesis that, amongst the former, agencies differed in the theory adopted to inform their program design. Given the existence of numerous theories that describe the interpretive processes that inform behavior change, identifying salient variables and behavior change processes becomes a challenging task. Investigating this, however, is important from the perspective of giving risk management policy makers and planners the processes they need to guide how to develop and combine information and behavior into the required interventions.",

However, it was integrated with other models or theories in three studies 16\n,\n17\n,\n18. One study stated that HBM had more predictive power of behavior than explaining behavior 16. The rationale for use of TPB for disease outbreak preparedness include TPB\u2019s explanatory power along with social cognitive theory 16, TPB\u2019s widely applicability to predict the intention and behavior 17\n,\n23, and TPB\u2019s more appropriateness \u201cfor situations where individuals do not perceive themselves as having complete control over their behavior\u201d 22. The MLOC theory was applied, as stated by one study, due to the MLOC\u2019s capability to explain the behavior of individual and its applicability in situations whereby hazards may be beyond the control of people. In doing so, however, it was used along with the HBM to test and for the purpose of comparison 18. Four studies applied the EPPM to assess preparedness in the context of disease outbreaks, and the rationale for its application were the \u201cusefulness\u201d of EPPM to understand adaptive behavior \u201cin the face of unknown risk\u201d 19, EPPM\u2019s \u201cusefulness\u201d to understand \u201chow health care may positively or negatively influence their [health workers\u2019] willingness to fulfill the response expectations\u201d 21, and to test the model 25. One study that applied EPPM not clearly stated the reason of using it 20. PMT was applied to further build on the previous studies 26, while the Social Cognitive Model was used to test the model on behavioral responses to pandemic influenza 27, and SPMI derived from previous theories and models to test the relationship between personal, community, social factors and the formation of intention to act, and the mediation of social trust 28.",

The study populations of these five studies were less than 40 years of age (n =387) 14, pregnant women (n=250) 15 , aged 19 to 24 years (n =473) 16, older than 18 years (n= 134) 17, and 65 years or older (n = 2147) 18. Thus, the results of each of these studies cannot be generalized to other age groups of their respective general populations, and the small sample size 17 present in one study could threaten its internal validity. In addition, these studies were conducted at higher institutes 14\n,\n16, hospital 15 and online 17; and hence the studies\u2019 settings could limit generalizing the results to the same populations who are not in a higher institute, not regularly visiting hospital during pregnancy, and who are not regular (or who do not use at all ) internet users, respectively. The response rates of three studies were quite high, ranging from 88.8% to 94.8% 14\n,\n15\n,\n16, while one study sent a questionnaire two times and the average response rate was 58% 18, and in one study the response rate was not reported 17. Therefore, the interpretation of the results of each of these studies needs to take into account sample size, setting and response rate; as these factors among others introduce potential sources of bias into the nature and interpretation of the respective studies\u2019 findings.",

In three of the studies that applied this model, it was shown that perceived higher threat and higher efficacy predicted the willingness of health workers to respond to an emergency when either required or asked 19\n,\n20\n,\n21. Moreover, these studies found perceived efficacy to be a more significant (i.e., higher predictive utility) component of the EPPM in determining the health workers\u2019 willingness to respond to pandemic influenza/flu emergency 19\n,\n21. In addition, perceived psychological preparedness reported to be a vital predictor of willingness to respond to emergency 19\n,\n20\n,\n21 (refer table 3). As the aims of these studies were to determine the willingness of health workers to respond to emergency, the set-up and sampling method used are robust, and the results could be generalized to beyond the study populations.",

As its major constructs, TPB has three components that include attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy (perceived behavioral control). Based on \u201chierarchical ordinary least square regression\u201d analysis, a study conducted in the USA reported that attitude (b=0.25, p<0.001) and subjective norm (b=0.40, p<0.001) were positively associated with behavioral intention for swine flu vaccination; whereas self-efficacy was not associated with behavioral intention (b=-0.7, p>0.05) 16. A similar pattern was observed in a study conducted in UK (analysed using \u201cHierarchical ordinary least square regression\u201d), that reported that attitude (b= -0.51, p < 0.001) and subjective norm (b= - 0.20, p < 0.01) inversely predicted behavioral intention for swine flu vaccination; while self-efficacy (b= - 0.08, p > 0.05) did not predict behavioral intention 17. With regard to predicting nurses intentions to care for SARS patients, a path analytical study identified, attitude (b=0.25, p< 0.001) and self-efficacy (b= 0.39, p<0.001) as predictors. However, based on our own interpretation of the findings reported, the variable subjective norm was not included in the path analysis in this study 22. From a study investigating blood donors\u2019 intention to donate during high and low risk periods of avian influenza, clear evidence was not generated, as the major constructs of TPB were not clearly analyzed and summarized in a way that permitted the association of intention with those variables; sample size of the study was small and response rate wasn\u2019t reported 23.",

PMT includes threat appraisal and coping appraisal as its major elements. According to this particular study that applied PMT, threat appraisal was measured by perceived personal risk, emotional response to threat and perceived severity of health threat; on the other hand, coping appraisal was measured by general response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response costs. According to the results this study, coping appraisal was found to explain the self-reported intention of pharmaceutical measures 26.",

As such, the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) 29, affective and cognitive routes 30, expectancy-valence models (model of risk reduction process) 31, outcome expectancy and self-efficacy 32, Protective Motivation Theory (PMT) 33, Vested Interest Theory (VIT) 34, and the social cognitive model 35 were identified as theories and models that had been applied to assess flood hazard preparedness. PMT and VIT were chosen, as stated by their respective studies, as being adopted with the goal of improving on previous works by modifying or adding additional variables 33\n,\n34. The range of theories used to assess flood preparedness provided an opportunity to examine the diversity of variables and relationships between variables in behavior change theories and models. The PADM \u201chas a more detailed set of salient beliefs\u201d and its clarity in terms of \u201cresponse costs\u201d compared with PMT 29. The rationale for using the Expectancy-valence models (model of risk reduction process) derived from PMT, the PADM, and Paton\u2019s social cognitive preparation model was to assess the risk reduction process in an all-hazards context 31. For example, the rationale for using the social cognitive model, which was initially developed to test volcanic hazards preparedness, was to test whether its predictive utility was sustained when applied to predicting earthquake and flood hazard preparedness 35. The other studies discussed here did not explicitly provide reasons for their selection of the theories/models they applied to flood disaster preparedness 30\n,\n32.",

In addition, critical awareness directly and indirectly predicted intention to prepare and intention to seek information (with these being linked to predicting the adoption of protective measures and not adopting measures respectively).

The third study (n=800), termed the model it applied for terrorism preparedness, \u201cadaptation terror preparedness.\u201d In this model, in addition to its incorporation of socio-demographic and past experience factors, also included risk perceptions, social networks, emotive, and information as the predictors of adaptive behavior for terrorism. The results of this third study revealed that apart from the socio-demographic factors, the other variables posited as being predictors did not act as predictive factors of adaptive behavior for terrorism 45.

To build on the previous studies, one of the two studies (n=1302 with response rate 40.5%) applied the Trans-theoretical Model (TTM) to investigate the individuals\u2019 emergency preparedness based on study participants\u2019 acquisition of information from the media about any natural, man-made, and influenza related disasters and emergencies. This study reported that self-efficacy, subjective norm, and exposure to emergency news were positively associated with emergency preparedness and having emergency items 46. The second study (n=3181) too, set out to further the previously existing knowledge on emergency preparedness by applying EPPM to assess the willingness of volunteers to respond to disasters emanating from weather, pandemic influenza, radiological, and bio-terrorism hazards. Thus, according to the results of this second study, despite the variation of association of between self-efficacy and willingness to respond across the above listed hazards scenarios, self-efficacy was found to be sole predictor of willingness to respond; while other components of the EPPM were not statistical significantly associated with willingness to respond 47. Though the second study 47 did not specifically report the response rate of study participants, both studies\u2019 sample sizes were large and both selected participants at random, reducing the risk of their results being affected by selection and information bias (standardized questionnaires were used in both cases).",

However, the study that used the same model (HBM) and the same method of analysis for preparedness for heat wave hazards showed that risk perception (perceived susceptibility and severity) and perceived barriers were not associated with preparedness 41. While it must remain tentative until more research is conducted, this raises the possibility that systematic study across hazards is required to ascertain whether hazard preparedness differ depending on the specific hazard. Another potential issue raised here concerns the relative exposure people have had to influenza versus heatwave hazards. Levels of coverage of heatwaves have, in the past, been considerably lower than that for influenza and other health hazards. This lack of coverage could affect people\u2019s ability to personalize their risk and thus affect how they interpret issues such as perceived susceptibility and severity. Again, this idea remains speculative until more work is conducted, and this should be done before making broad decisions about the utility or otherwise of a theory.",

In the logistic regression analysis, perceived barriers and perceived cues to action were the only elements from the HBM that demonstrated an association with preparedness for climate change. However, in structural equation model analysis, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefit, and perceived barrier were associated with having an emergency kit, some directly and others indirectly 40. Therefore, apart from the study settings, size, and population type (in some high risk group population selected for study) that challenge the validity of the findings of some studies, the method of analysis used to show the relationship of constructs proved to be very crucial for demonstrating the predictive utility of the theory for hazard preparedness and most studies that applied HBM did demonstrate this 14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n18\n,\n41 . This issue applies to testing all theories and calls for future work on process models such as those discussed in this paper to be analyzed using at least path analysis and preferably structural equation modelling.",

Three of the studies conducted using this theory demonstrated, using logistic regression analysis, that higher perceived threat and higher efficacy predicted the willingness of health workers to respond to emergency when either required or asked 19\n,\n20\n,\n21 and one study reported the significant association of only self-efficacy to preparedness 47. The fourth study, which used structural equation model for the analysis, demonstrated that threat, being mediated by fear arousal, predicted behavioral intention for preparedness, while self-efficacy was directly associated with behavioral intention for preparedness 25. In five of the studies reviewed, the methods of study participants\u2019 selection was random sampling, the sample sizes were also high in four of them and the outcomes of the studies strongly supports the applicability of EPPM in disaster and emergency preparedness (particularly when the focus is on self-efficacy and threat). However, the mediating effect of fear observed in the association of threat and preparedness, as shown in one study using path analysis 25. This reiterates the need for future work applying the EPPM to not only include self-efficacy and threat but also to expand the model further through the inclusion of other variables.",

Overall, the TPB has been shown to be one of the more influential theories applied in disaster and emergency preparedness settings. However, consistent with findings from studies using alternative theories/models, issues regarding the empirical demonstration of the the association of variables or constructs in the TPB between each other and preparedness is limited.

This was done so, because during the pilot testing, the numbers of articles generated by using only general terms from some of the databases were fewer (particularly from PubMed and Nursing Index databases) than the combination of general and specific keywords. Therefore, we decided to include the specific terminologies for behaviors/model that were familiar to us from the pilot-study exercise and our own experiences (e.g. health belief model, theory of planned behavior and etc\u2026); disasters (natural disasters such as earthquake and flood, man-made disasters chemical and biological terrorism); and for the term preparedness alternative terminologies such as protective action, adaptive behavior, and others were incorporated into search strategies. These search strategies were able to generate studies with specified theories and models that their keywords were included, and also other studies with behavioral theories and models that their keywords were not included. For example, studies with Witte\u2019s Extended Parallel Process Model, Vested Interest Theory, and Protective Motivation Theory (PMT) were obtained despite their specific keywords were not in search strategies. The appropriateness of the search terms used is supported by the fact that the search did identify papers covering the most commonly used theories and models and brought to light those less frequently used in the preparedness literature.Hence, while the inclusion of specific terms along with general terms found to capture more studies with theories and models even whose specific terms were unspecified in search strategies, still we do feel non-inclusion of some specific terms (for theories and models unfamiliar to us in disaster field) might have resulted in some relevant studies of our interest being omitted, and that is one of the caveats that needs to be addressed by future studies. It is also important to note that the exclusion criteria meant that several studies were identified by their use of one or more of the above terms in their title, keywords or abstract were excluded because they did not include a systematic empirical analysis of the theory or model. Future work should also be directed to exploring how and why studies did so. For example, did this occur because researchers felt that the theory was inappropriate in some way? This possibility could be explored in future studies as a way of delving deeper into the utility or otherwise of behavioral change theory approaches to hazard preparedness.",

Due to different methods of statistical analysis used across the studies (logistic regression, \u201chierarchical ordinary least square regression\u201d, and structural equation model) this made it difficult to summarize the results under each category of hazard type. However, efforts have been made to summarize where possible and in other instances results were presented qualitatively for the sake of clarity. Despite these limitations, we do believe that this systematic review could contribute to the existing literature on disasters and emergencies preparedness. The content provides a good foundation for future comparative studies. The results offer tentative support for the all-hazards utility of several theories.

These hazards were preponderantly various forms of influenza (H1N1 and H5N1), floods, and earthquake; no specific man-made hazards were focused, apart from the general terrorism. Theoretically, models and theories have elements or constructs, which are interdependent to each other and then finally influencing the main dependent variable within constructs. Hence, studies ideally purported to reveal this interdependence of variables/elements/constructs, besides demonstrating the direct influence of some specific constructs on the main dependent variable/construct. One of the methods of analyses that could serve that purpose is structural equation model; however, most of the studies did not give the information pertaining to the influence of each construct on each other and the analyses used were traditional logistic regressions. Studies that used social cognitive theory portrayed their results in terms of path analyses, and few of the studies with other theories and models showed the relationship of constructs to each other and to the main dependent variable.
