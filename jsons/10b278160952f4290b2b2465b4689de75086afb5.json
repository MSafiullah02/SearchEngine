First, a sufficiently useful disease spreading simulation system requires complex models, including social contact networks, local and global mobility patterns of individuals, and epidemiological parameters for the infectious disease (eg, the infectious period). Epidemic simulations track tens or hundreds of interdependent parameters, spanning multiple layers and geospatial frames, affected by complex dynamic processes operating at different resolutions. Moreover, an ensemble of stochastic epidemic realizations may include hundreds or thousands of simulations, each with different parameters settings corresponding to slightly different but plausible scenarios [24, 25] . As a consequence, running and interpreting simulation results (along with the real-world observations) to generate timely actionable results pose challenges.",

This necessitates continuous analyses and interpretations of the incoming data and adaptation of the networks and models. Therefore, simulation ensembles may need to be continuously revised and refined as the situation on the ground changes. Revisions involve incorporating the real-world observations, as well as updated probability surfaces, into existing simulations to alter their outcomes, whereas refinements involve identifying new simulations to run based on the changing situation on the ground to provide trustable recommendations. As the situation on the ground and intervention mechanisms evolve, the sampling strategies for the input parameter spaces have to be varied (by eliminating irrelevant scenarios and considering new scenarios or varying the likelihood of old scenarios) in such a way that more-accurate simulation results are obtained where it is more relevant.",

Therefore, tools that help execute largescale simulation ensembles under a large number of diverse hypotheses/scenarios and those that facilitate analysis, exploration, interpretation, and visualization of large simulation ensembles (aligned with the real-world observations) to generate timely actionable results are critically needed for understanding the evolution patterns of the outbreaks (including estimating transmissibility, forecasting the spatiotemporal spread at different spatial scales, and assessing the cost and impact of interventions, including travel controls, at various stages of the epidemic) and supporting real-time decision-making and hypothesis testing through large-scale simulations.",

To account for uncertainty in the epidemiology of the disease, characteristics of surveillance systems, and actual field conditions (eg, healthcare capacity) including the availability and effectiveness of the interventions, public health experts execute a large number of simulations by using the epiRun simulation ensemble creation engine to generate simulation instances. The configuration file for epiRun specifies applicable disease models, parameter value ranges and sampling granularities, connectivity and mobility graph assumptions, simulation duration, and assumptions regarding when and what interventions are to be applied. Given these, epiRun schedules the execution of these simulations. The simulation metadata and results are then read and stored in epiStore. Intuitively, each simulation result corresponds to a so-called possible world, and thus it is annotated and indexed with the metadata describing the corresponding scenario.

The query also specifies a particular mobility graph, describing expected movements of the populations during the epidemic, as an underlying assumption. In addition, the query asks the system to return daily (1-D) averages of infected, incidence, and deaths simulation output parameters for Arizona, California, and New Mexico for an epidemic simulation that lasts 8 months.
