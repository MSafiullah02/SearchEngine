For example, wheezing illnesses in children older than 2 years are most common in children who have rhinovirus infections together with allergic sensitization, nasal eosinophilia, or increased nasal eosinophil cationic protein levels.4 Additional studies have identified increased expression of the Fc\u03b5RI receptor on monocytes and dendritic cells during acute asthma exacerbations.5 One potential mechanism by which IgE could affect viral exacerbations relates to effects of the Fc\u03b5RI on interferon responses. In vitro experiments demonstrated that increased Fc\u03b5RI expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and IgE cross-linking strongly inhibited rhinovirus-induced interferon production in cells from children with allergic asthma.6\n",
