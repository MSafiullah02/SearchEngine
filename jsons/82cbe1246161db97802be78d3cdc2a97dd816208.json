In this report we document for the first time that high numbers of LGL accumulate in the liver during viral infection . An initial wave of NK/LGL is followed by a substantially greater influx of CTL/LGL . We compare hepatotropic and nonhepatotropic strains of LCMV (a noncytopathic virus) for their effect on NK cell and CTL accumulation and activity in the liver. The effect on NK/LGL accumulation stimulated by two highly cytopathic hepatotropic viruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), is contrasted to that caused by noncytopathic LCMV.",

At the end of incubation, plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min, and 0.1 ml of the supernatant was removed and counted in a Beckman gamma counter (model 5500; Beckman Instruments, Inc ., Palo Alto, CA) . The coefficient of variation among quadruplicate wells was <5% . Data were expressed as percent specific 51 Cr release : 100 X (cpm experimental -cpm spontaneous)/(cpm maximum -cpm spontaneous) . In some experiments that examined CTL activity, lysis was expressed as: percent virus-specific lysis = percent lysis of infected target -percent lysis of uninfected target . To compare the total lytic capabilities of effector populations isolated from different organs, calculations of total lytic units were computed by the formula : total lytic units = (fraction of targets lysed X number of cells per organ)/(E/T ratio). An E/T ratio on the linear portion of the cytotoxicity curve was used for these calculations .",

The induction of NK cells and CTL activities and the accumulation of LGL in the liver were studied on days 1-14 p.i. in animals infected i.p. with either LCMV-ARM or LCMV-WE . LCMV-ARM is generally nonhepatotropic and grows poorly in z no-U V 1Bi -J the liver during acute infection, whereas the LCMV-WE strain is hepatotropic and replicates in the liver to high titer (18) . Both viruses induced an increase in NK cell activity detected against both YAC-1 and L929 cells by day 1 p.i. that peaked at days 3-5 p.i. and declined thereafter ( Fig. 1 D and E) . The appearance and progressive increase of NK cell activity through day 5 p.i. were paralleled by a progressive increase in LGL number beginning on day 1 p.i. (Fig. 1 B) . Virus-specific CTL activity began to increase on day 5 p.i. with both viruses and peaked on day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1 F) . By day 7 p.i., the LCMV-WE infection induced an average 28-fold increase in the number of liver leukocytes, whereas the LCMV-ARM infection induced only a fivefold increase ( Fig. 1 A) . These differences in total leukocyte number were confirmed histologically : LCMV-WEinfected livers had markedly greater infiltrations of mononuclear inflammatory cells than LCMV-ARM-infected livers (not shown) . The centers of focal accumulations of mononuclear cells occasionally contained one or two necrotic hepatocytes with pyknotic nuclei and intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm . Because LCMV is relatively noncytopathic (28) , it is likely that hepatocyte death results from an immunopathologic mechanism . When the total lytic capacities of the liver leukocyte populations were calculated, the LCMV-WE infection resulted in 10-fold higher total CTL lytic units on day 7 p.i. than did LCMV-ARM infection ( Fig. 1 H) . These levels of day 7 CTL activity closely correlated with the total numbers of LGL isolated on day 7 from the livers of mice infected with LCMV-WE or LCMV-ARM ( Fig. 1 B) .",

(Fig. 1) were suggestive of the NK cell and CTL lytic profiles reported previously in the spleen (8) . To characterize these effector cell populations further, liver leukocytes were treated with various antibodies and complement (C) in vitro . The cells remaining after treatment were tested for cytotoxic activity and were examined for the presence of LGL on stained cytocentrifuge smears. The data in Table I (experiment 1) indicate that day 3 cytotoxic activity against YAC-1 cells was completely sensitive to treatment with anti-asialo GM, + C and slightly reduced by anti-Thy-1 .2 + C. Treatment with C and J 11 d antibody (recognizing a marker on granulocytes and B cells [25] ) had no effect on lysis. Changes in the number of cells morphologically identified as LGL paralled the changes in lytic activity: anti-asialo GM, + C treatment markedly reduced the number of LGL, anti-Thy-1 .2 + C resulted in a partial depletion (64%), and J 11 d + C was without effect on LGL number . Thus, the phenotype for the day 3 p.i. effector cells is consistent with the reported phenotype of NK cells (29) : asialo GM,-positive, Thy-1 .2+/-, Jlld-, YAC-1 killer, and LGL morphology . Liver leukocytes isolated at day 7 p.i . were treated with antibody reagents known to react with determinants present on CTL. As shown in Table I (exp . 2), treatments with either anti-Thy-1 .2 + C or anti-Lyt-2 + C significantly reduced the virus-specific lysis of infected target cells. These treatments also resulted in the depletion of a significant proportion of the LGL from the effector cell population .",

Other experiments showed that liver NK/LGL activated in vivo by poly(I-C) treatment or MHV infection could be enriched in plastic-nonadherent cell populations (data not shown) . The early appearance (day 1-2 p.i .) of augmented NK cell lytic activity in the liver is also seen in the spleen (8) , where activity peaks around day 3 p.i . and then declines . Furthermore, the liver leukocytes contain \"activated\" NK cells at day 3 p.i . as evidenced by their ability to lyse L929 cells, a target resistant to \"endogenous\" NK cell-mediated lysis (Fig . 1 D) . The lysis of NK cellsensitive YAGI cells by liver leukocytes continues to remain above endogenous levels on day 7 p.i . with LCMV-ARM ( Fig . 1 E) , but lysis of the more resistant L929 cells is declining (Fig . 1 D) . This prolonged elevation of NK cell-mediated lysis against YAGI cells has also been observed in peripheral blood (33) . The circulating NK cells at day 7 p.i . are lytically active against YAGI targets but they have lost their ability to lyse the more resistant L929 cells (33) . Thus, the high NK cell-mediated lysis against YAGI cells seen in the liver and blood at day 7 p.i . is more likely due to the high NK cell number rather than to an activated state of the NK cell population . This may reflect the fact that IFN levels, required for NK cell activation, decline after 3 d p.i . (8) .",

The IFN-inducer poly(I-C) stimulates comparable increases in NK cell activity and number (Table VII) . In contrast, MHV and MCMV, which cause highly cytopathic infections o\u00a3 hepatocytes, stimulate much higher levels of NK/LGL in the liver (Table VII) . This is also apparent in beige mutant mice which, despite having defective NK cell function, respond to cytopathic MHV infection with large numbers of abnormal NK/LGL . In these circumstances, the presence of the virus, by virtue of its lysing target cells, may provide an important stimulus for NK cell accumulation . Bukowski et al . (4) demonstrated that NK cells play a role in the early resistance to MCMV infection, and suggested that NK cells may provide resistance against MHV infection as well (23) . In contrast, LCMV infection does not seem to be regulated by NK cells (4, 23) . The tendency of a particular virus infection to attract a significant number of NK/LGL to a site of virus replication may be one factor in determining its sensitivity to NK cell-mediated antiviral resistance .",

The lack of a large inflammatory cell infiltrate in any strain of mouse at 3 d p.i . or in nu/nu mice at 7 d p.i . suggests that the T cell hypothesis may be correct (Table VI) . Supporting this hypothesis is that inflammatory responses in the brain or footpad of LCMV-infected mice are dependent upon the presence of H-2K-or D-restricted T cells (34, 35) . The fact that a higher inflammatory response in the liver is seen with LCMV-WE than with LCMV-ARM is probably due to the fact that LCMV-WE replicates to higher titers (>100-fold) in the liver .

The dramatic LCMV-WE-induced day 7 increases in total leukocytes and LGL were absent in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, suggesting that the increases were T cell-dependent . LCMV-ARM infection of C57BL/6 mice induced significant spleen CTL activity but little liver CTL activity, whereas LCMV-WE infection resulted in significant liver CTL activity but minimal spleen CTL activity.",

MHV-infected mice homozygous for the beige (bg/bg) mutation also exhibited significant increases in liver NK/LGL cell number and activity, although the activity was less than heterozygote controls, and the morphology of the LGL granules was aberrant.",
