Over the last few years, a shift from curative towards preventive medicine has been observed in the livestock sector and represents a key element of the European Union Animal Health Strategy since 2007 (European Comission, 2007). Nevertheless, several surveys highlight a low implementation level of biosecurity measures (BSM) by the farmers with different constraints expressed such as cost, usefulness, workload, and lack of clarity on the measures (Brennan & Christley, 2013; Gunn, Heffernan, Hall, McLeod, & Hovi, 2008; Hoe & Ruegg, 2006; Kristensen & Jakobsen, 2011; N\u00f6remark, Fr\u00f6ssling, & Lewerin, 2010; Sarrazin, Cay, Laureyns, & Dewulf, 2014; Sayers et al., 2013). The rate of implementation of BSM seems even lower in cattle farms versus pig or poultry production facilities (Sarrazin et al., 2014). To better advise cattle farmers and increase their level of implementation, it is essential to prioritize the biosecurity measures, according to the most important infectious diseases affecting or threatening Belgian cattle.",

Given the lack of prevalence data for most cattle diseases, most of them followed the Delphi methodology (WHO, 2006) based on: (a) the establishment of an initial list of diseases, (b) the development of a prioritization methodology translated into a questionnaire, and (c) ranking or scoring of the different diseases by a panel of experts. The Delphi method based on a consensus approach has many advantages (e.g., no need of scientific evidence as it relies on experts\u2019 opinion which can be modified through debates and avoids personal and political influence as a consensus is needed) and is recognized by the scientific community worldwide since its development by the RAND Corporation in the late 1960's. The recent prioritization exercises identified in the literature (ANSES, 2012; Ciliberti, Gavier\u2010Wid\u00e9n, Yon, Hutchings, & Artois, 2015; DISCONTOOLS, 2016; Havelaar et al., 2010; Humblet et al., 2012; McIntyre et al., 2014) were quantitative, semiquantitative, or qualitative and based on the Delphi method with the exception of two. One of them was based on the H\u2010index (McIntyre et al., 2014) and the second one on a literature review with a scoring and weighting system applied and validated by a panel of experts (Humblet et al., 2012) (Supporting Information Table S1).",

These regional databases compiled the number of tests performed on cattle, per year and age category (adult, calves, and newborns) and their result (positive/negative), over a 3\u2010year period (2013 to 2015). The Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre (CODA\u2010CERVA), the national reference laboratory, provided additional data covering the period between 2012 and 2014. For each disease, the annual number of tests and the proportion of positive results were analysed. Diseases were considered equally important and attributed a score of \u201c1\u201d if, in at least one laboratory, one of the following arbitrary conditions was recorded: (i) >100 tests performed, (ii) >25% positive results, (iii) increasing number of tests requested over the period of concern (>66th centile), or (iv) increasing number of positive results (>66th centile).

Its classification as \u201cimportant\u201d could therefore be reconsidered. For both leptospirosis and bluetongue, the number of test requests increased significantly in 2015, despite a low frequency reported by RVP. This could be related to increased surveillance motivated by bluetongue outbreaks in France and suspected outbreaks of leptospirosis in Belgium. Indeed, for leptospirosis, a peak of abortions, with icteric syndrome, was observed during the first half of 2014, which led to increased testing (Delooz et al., 2015).

Previous studies have confirmed the endemic status of Bo\u2010HV4 in southern Belgium, along with a high seroconversion rate of cows (Delooz, Czaplicki, Houtain, Dal Pozzo, & Saegerman, 2016). Nevertheless, the relationship between Bo\u2010HV4 and abortion is still subject to controversy and the disease might be underranked by the RVP due to the nonpathognomonic character of clinical signs. In order to further assess the role of Bo\u2010HV4 in abortions, a recent study included the search of the virus in the abortion protocol already implemented in southern Belgium (Delooz et al., 2016; Delooz, Czaplicki, Houtain, Mullender, & Saegerman, 2012) and highlighted a possible association; specific awareness raising messages were already sent in that region (Delooz et al., 2012). Regarding Schmallenberg disease, such high proportion of positive results is probably related to the confirmatory character of the test, within a herd management program or policy, as clinical signs are quite pathognomonic; it does probably not reflect a high disease prevalence nor the current circulation rate of the virus. At last, a high proportion of positive tests was noticed for cryptosporitiosis. Cryptosporidium sp. is a coccidium causing clinical signs mostly in young animals; adult cattle is resistant and, thus, does not show any clinical signs (Geurden, 2007).",

Nineteen of them were not considered as important by the previous prioritization exercises while relevant in Belgian adult cattle. This additional list could guide the decision makers for future control programs as these diseases are a major concern for cattle holders. The six diseases identified as important by the three data sources are covering the different diseases transmission pathways, therefore the proper implementation of their related BSM (Table 4) should improve the prevention and control of the majority of other cattle diseases. Based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change, as well as other theories and existing models (Armitage, 2009; Mase, Gramig, & Prokopy, 2017; Morris, Marzano, Danady, & O'Brien, 2012; Prochaska & Diclemente, 1983), the \u201cpossible personal benefits\u201d is a constant key factor motivating the adoption of new behaviour. Therefore, identifying the risk factors and associated biosecurity measures related to the six diseases with a high or significant disease index could be used to improve the technical guidance for farmers and better answer their main concerns. Once the farmer has engaged into a behaviour change and is convinced of the efficiency and relevance of biosecurity, the introduction of additional measures will be accepted easily. As the six most important diseases to consider cover all the possible transmission pathways, future researches should focus on the BSM prioritization based on their level of implementation and acceptation by the herders, their feasibility and their cost\u2010effectiveness in terms of disease(s) prevention.

Identifying the most important diseases affecting cattle farms is therefore necessary in order to initiate the process of change. Specific measures related to public health purposes could be introduced easily afterwards. Future researches should focus on the assessment of the level of implementation of the BSM related to the most important diseases to be targeted (six in the case of Belgian cattle herds), as well as the possible constraints and factors affecting their adoption by the farmers in order to be able to prioritize the most effective BSM to be promoted.",
