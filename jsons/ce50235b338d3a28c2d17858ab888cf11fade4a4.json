            "text": "To the Editor, During the COVID-19 lockdown phase, people experience anxiety and emotional break down (1) . As people face days of isolation at home, this creates an ideal condition to engage in online activities and watching television. As recreation sources are limited at home settings and internet/television are easily accessible, readily available and of course affordable; it may result in binge-watching. People with binge-watching behavior often watch multiple episodes in a single go (2) . Considering this fact, the tele-industry is spending on making web-series that compel people for binge-watching and to promote this behavior often all the episodes of a particular season of web-series are released simultaneously (2) . In the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic with a global lockdown state, as people have little to do, there seems to be an increase in bingewatching. To the best of our knowledge, no study studied binge-watching behavior during pandemics and their short-term as well as long-term effects. This study aimed to determine the binge-watching pattern of television, internet resources during this COVID-19 lockdown in South East Asian countries. This is a descriptive study with a cross-sectional design. It was conducted in the general population of four Southeast Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia & Nepal).",

During the lockdown period, 73.7 % agreed to a considerable increase in binge-watching with an increase in an average time of 3-5 hours (17.3 %) and 5+ hours (11.5 %) of binge-watching. The major platform used for viewing has been you-tube (52.7 %) and the major content watched has been news (69.2 %). The frequency of binge-watching has been daily for 27.6% of participants.",

It has been reported in recent day electronic and printed media that there is an increase in viewership of television and internet over the past few months, globally. During the lockdown period although more than half the participants (53.3 %) were found to be working from home yet most of them agreed that their TV/ internet usage has increased (73.7 %) considerably daily (27.6 %). This might indicate the use of binge-watching as a coping mechanism. It is considered an unhealthy coping mechanism as people tend to substitute the live unacceptable experiences with fantasy and imagination generating web-series and television shows (3). The psychological motivation found for binge-watching has been to pass time and escape boredom (52.6 %), relieve stress (25 %), overcome loneliness (15.7%). It leads to the immediate gratification of needs. The constant availability of content for binge-watching helps in the gratification of needs whenever and wherever one wants, resulting in an imbalance between the short-term pleasures and the potential costs of media exposure (4). It is too early to say whether binge-watching will result in behavioral addiction or not. However, existing evidence supports the association of binge-watching with mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, fatiguability and impairment in self-regulation (5). This study revealed that binge-watching sometimes causes significant interference in sleep (39.1 %), disturbs in completion of work (32.3 %) as well as causes conflict with others (28.1 %) (Table 1) .",
