            "text": "The chorioallantoic membrane (chorioallantois, CAM) is a vascular membrane found in embryonated eggs of some amniotes, such as birds and reptiles. It results from the fusion of the mesodermal layers of two developmental structures: the allantois and the chorion [1]. In mammals, the chorioallantois interacts intimately with the maternal decidua basalis to form the placenta[2]. In the absence of maternal participation during development, the chick extraembryonic membranes form the sole source of support for the physiological requisites of the embryo including nourishment, gaseous exchange and excretion. For much of the incubation, the CAM, the subject of the current study, is the sole source of gaseous exchange. It is formed of three layers, which include the chorionic epithelium, the mesenchyme and the allantoic epithelium. During growth, blood capillaries and sinuses invade the chorionic layer and become lodged in between the epithelial cells and in so doing they gain close proximity with the ambient air (within 0.2 \u03bcm) [3]. In addition the CAM also plays an essential role in osteogenesis by transporting calcium into the embryo from the eggshell [4, 5].",

It is incipient from embryonic day 4 or 5 (E4 or E5) of incubation [6], and grows into a tripartite membrane consisting of the chorion, the mesoderm and the allantois [7, 8]. Each of the three distinct layers has its definite structural components with specific functions. The chorion is ectodermal in origin and consists of villous cavity cells (VC), capillary covering cells (CC) and endothelial cells (EC) surrounding the lumina of chorionic capillaries [9]. Even in the absence of the shell and shell membranes, the various cell types of the chorion differentiate well, although may be a bit delayed [10]. In the latter study, VC and CC cells, which normally appear by E12-E14, were not apparent until E15. However, later it was shown that presence and transportation of calcium were necessary for proper differentiation of CAM [11].",

The CAM completely covers the inner surface of the shell membrane by E12 [13]. During development, vascular capillaries from the superficial aspects of the mesoderm become incorporated into the chorionic epithelium and the specialized cells of the chorion differentiate [9, 12, 14]. A study of the entire incubation period of the CAM showed that by E8, it covers 75% of the inner shell surface rising to 100% by E12 [15]. Towards hatching signs of degeneration have been reported in the cells of the chorionic layer [16].",

In the post-fusion period, the various cellular components of the chorion differentiate, chorionic capillaries assume a superficial position and the allantois increases its strata up to 4. The accelerated differentiation is concomitant with augmentation of sizes for all layers, until E18, when a maximum is reached.",

However, using PCNA assay we noted sustained cell proliferation up to E14 and by E17, only occasional proliferative cells were encountered. Previously, filopodia containing cells were reported to occur close to the chorionic epithelium at E12 [37] but they were not recognized as participants in the growth of the chorionic epithelium. Filopodia observed here were most prominent in the allantoic cells and emanated from both the epithelial cells and the cells aggregating in the suballantoic layer. The filopodia from the mesenchymal cells established contact with those of the epithelial cells or with the cell walls of the epithelial cells and in so doing became part of the allantois. A similar process occurred in the chorionic layer, an indication that both layers grew by recruitment of subepithelial mesenchymal cells. This observation was further fortified by the fact that in the period of robust growth for the two layers (E11-E14), there was remarkable proliferation of cells in subchorionic and suballantoic parts of the mesenchyme.",

This transformation of mesenchymal cells was shown to be mediated by Wnt-4 since mice lacking Wnt-4 activity fail to form pretubular cell aggregates during nephrogenesis [39]. The known molecular regulators of MET in the kidney have been reviewed recently [40]. However, no data exist on the molecular control of the growth of CAM layers. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that differentiating chorionic cells at E12 CAM were distinguishable through annexin (anx) expression. Annexins are a multigene family of Ca(2+)-regulated phospholipid-binding and membrane-binding proteins that function to control membrane structure and certain membrane transport phenomena [41]. Anx-1 was found in CC and VC cells while anx-2 was localized in capillaries of the chorionic epithelium and basal cells of the allantoic epithelium [37]. Anx-6 occurred in basal cells or endothelial-like cells of the chorionic epithelium and in the media of larger vessels in the mesenchyme [37]. A detailed study of the molecular control of the differentiating CAM layers would further illuminate the preponderant processes.",

In a detailed study, Fitze-Gschwind investigated the chick developing CAM between E5-E21 and noted that the chorionic epithelium increased in thickness from 3.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcm at E8 to a maximum of 13.7\u00b1 2.2 \u03bcm at E19 and then decreased to 9.4 \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcm at E20[42]. Elsewhere, Reizis and colleagues reported that the thickness of CAM decreases from 67.4 \u00b1 26.4 \u03bcm at E10 to 49.4 \u00b1 20 \u03bcm at E14 and then increased steadily to 110.4 \u00b1 38.3 \u03bcm at E20 [19]. Later, Maksimov and others indicated that thickness of CAM increases from 61.9 \u00b1 2.48 \u03bcm at E7 to a maximum of 82.5 \u00b1 4.95 \u03bcm at E10 and then decreased steadily to 41.8 \u00b1 3.17 \u03bcm at E20. A stereologic study of the CAM at E16 documented an arithmetic mean thickness of 0.47 \u03bcm for the air-blood barrier and a CAM surface area of 90.2 cm2 [43].Earlier the arithmetic mean thickness of the air-blood barrier was estimated to be 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm and the surface area had been reported to be 63.5 \u00b1 2.5at E20 [42]. The discrepancies in the data reported for the CAM emanate partly due to use of model-based methods, and perhaps also the methods of sampling employed. The decrease of CAM thickness on E14 in the study of Reizis et al was not explained but Maksimov and colleagues note that on E18 after internal pipping, the thickness of the CAM decreases primarily at the expense of the mesodermal layer [18]. This is plausible and is corroborated by the data in the current study. After internal pipping, the lungs become ventilated and the functional blood circulation in the lung is initiated at the expense of the CAM circulation. This results in decrease in blood volume in the vessels of CAM and plausibly this is replaced by water loss from the mesenchyme into the blood vessels. Blood flow through the CAM during incubation continues to increase from 1.3 ml/min at E10 to 4.5\u20135 ml/min at E18, with a temporal trajectory very similar to that of the egg V\u0307O2[44, 45] but decreases after internal pipping, when the lung becomes functional. Measurements on in vitro CAM preparations revealed the same developmental pattern and similar blood flow values (Van Golde et al., 1996).",

Local hypoxia ensues in the CAM after internal pipping as indicated by increase in HIF-1\u03b1 at E18, as blood is diverted to the CAMs[45]. HIF-1\u03b1 is known to induce transcription of VEGF [46] hence the similar pattern of expression for the two factors. The high expression levels of the three factors (HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF and VEGFR2), at E11 is consonant with expectations for a period of robust angiogenesis and consistent with previous observations [21, 22]. The high levels of SDF-1 are a possible indicator for participation of bone-marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMDC) in CAM angiogenesis at E11. Indeed we recently demonstrated that SDF-1/CXCL12 were up-regulated subsequent to inhibition of Notch signaling with a resultant recruitment of BMDC that led to massive intussusceptive angiogenesis [47].",

Stage I extends from E4 or 5 to E12 and is the stage of initiation and fabrication of CAM when fusion of the mesodermal components of the chorion and allantois occurs, thus forming the tripartite structure. Stage II extends from E12-E18 and this is the stage of differentiation and expansion. During this stage, various cell types in the allantois and chorion differentiate, the allantois increases in number of layers and the chorion becomes thicker and more complex in structure. Specialized cells such as the calcium transporting VC cells differentiate and gas exchange capillaries become superficially positioned in the chorion. Phase III extends from E18-E21 and this generally is the stage of regression when most CAM components are degenerating. It appears to start after the lung becomes functional and part of the blood is diverted to pulmonary circulation. Nevertheless, degeneration of the CAM is a well programmed process since progressive apoptosis of cells in all layers is evident well before E18.",

The mesodermal layer has loose connective tissue and fibroblasts (white arrows).

The first few granules start to appear in the outer layer of the allantois (arrowhead in c). A mesenchymal cell (Mc) is closely aligned with the inner layer of the epithelium. By E15, a two-cell layer is well accomplished and formation of the third layer begins (see layers 1, 2, 3 in d).
