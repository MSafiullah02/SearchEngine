Laboratory testing has improved to the point that a standard of care is to always suspect and test for this particular pathogen in stool specimens from patients with diarrhea. Importantly, it is the clinician's responsibility to communicate with the clinical microbiology laboratory to ensure that appropriate specimen collection and transport occurs, and that cultures are ordered and performed to recover and isolate STEC O157 from stool specimens submitted for bacterial cultures.3, 13 Isolation of a pure culture of STEC from patients is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis. In addition, pure cultures provide organisms for molecular epidemiology and outbreak investigations by public health laboratories working to prevent transmission in the community.14, 15 With the emerging awareness of STEC non-O157 as diarrheal pathogens, many clinical laboratories now offer immunoassay tests for Shiga toxins or for several non-O157 STEC O-antigens in parallel with stool cultures.3, 7 Immunoassay results can often be provided to the clinician before a final culture result is available. Culture confirmation of STEC should always be attempted by the clinical laboratory, however, or by a reference laboratory to which suspected STEC isolates are sent.16\n",

Commercial kits for real-time amplification tests for Shiga toxin genes, using instrument platforms currently in use in clinical laboratories, may eventually be available.21\n",

The infectious dose of STEC is low, about 100 bacteria,3 so person-to-person transmission can occur, leading to secondary cases in contacts of infected persons. Clinically recognized STEC diarrhea, and probably many subclinical STEC infections, occurs through direct animal-to-human contact.5 Risk of transmission to humans from food sources can be substantially reduced by careful washing of produce; pasteurization of juices and milk; and cooking to allow the internal temperature of meat, especially ground (minced) beef, to reach 70\u00b0C (160\u00b0F).4\n",

The monomeric A subunit of the Shiga toxin then enters the enterocyte by endocytosis and is transported to the rough endoplasmic reticulum by the Golgi apparatus.12 The A subunit is proteolytically cleaved in the cell cytoplasm, liberating the N-terminal (A1) portion, a glycosidase that hydrolyzes a specific adenine-ribose bond in the ribosomal 28S RNA. This cleavage prevents aminoacyl-tRNA binding, and irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis, resulting in cell death (see Fig. 2).48\n",

Children under the age of 10 years are at greatest risk. In children with STEC diarrhea, 15% develop HUS, which has 5% mortality rate. The STEC are unique among diarrheogenic E coli in producing Shiga toxin type 1 and type 2, the virulence factors responsible for bloody diarrhea and HUS. Cattle and other ruminants are the natural reservoir of STEC as their normal intestinal flora. Humans become infected by consumption of foods contaminated with cattle feces, notably undercooked ground (minced) beef, nonpasteurized products, and leafy vegetables that are consumed without cooking. The O157:H7 serotype of STEC predominates in human infections, and has been associated with outbreaks of diarrhea and HUS, but non-O157 STEC currently cause at least one third of STEC diarrhea and HUS. Diagnosis of STEC infection and of HUS is based on clinical signs; patient history; monitoring of renal function (especially in children); rapid testing of stool specimens for Shiga toxins; and isolation of STEC from stool cultures. Early diagnosis of STEC infection is important because of the contraindication for treating STEC using antimicrobial agents, and the intense supportive care needed if renal failure occurs.",
