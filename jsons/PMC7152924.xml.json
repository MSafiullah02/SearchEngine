On January 7, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed a novel beta-coronavirus from the throat swab sample of a patient through high-throughput sequencing [2]. The disease resembles severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] and has been subsequently named the 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Evidence pointing to the person-to-person transmission has occurred among close contacts in hospital and family [4], [5]. Considerable efforts for reducing transmission are required to control outbreaks. Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV [6] and MERS-CoV[7], can cause multiple system infections in various animals and mainly induce respiratory tract infections in humans [6]. Most patients exhibited mild symptoms and partial patients exhibited worse prognosis. To date, only a few COVID-19 patients have developed into severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome [1], [7], or multiple organ failure and eventually died. Given the rapid spread and serious harm of COVID-19, it is urgent to continuously improve and enrich its clinical diagnosis and treatment research. This updated analysis identified the defining laboratory results and clinical characteristics with improved precision and also elucidated the risk factors associated with mortality.",

Severe inflammatory responses contribute to weak adaptive immune response, thereby resulting in immune response imbalance. Therefore, circulating biomarkers that can represent inflammation and immune status are potential predictors for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients [9]. Peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil (NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), derived NLR ratio (d-NLR, neutrophil count divided by the result of WBC count minus neutrophil count), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) are indicators of the systematic inflammatory response [10] that are widely investigated as useful predictors for the prognosis of patients with viral pneumonia. By collecting the data from 93 laboratory-confirmed cases, we attempted to determine the effect of sex, age, CRP, WBC count, NLR, LMR, PLR, and co morbidities on the length of stay of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

At the end date of data collection (2020-02-18), more than 70000 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, and 1800 cases died. Mortality was less than 2.5% (CDC, China). In recent publications [1], [8], the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms were rare, suggesting the difference in viral tropism compared with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza [11]. Fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients on initial presentation and developed in 83.4% after hospitalization. The absence of fever in COVID-19 was more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV infection (2%) [6], [3], and such patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition focused heavily on fever detection [12]. Consistent with the two recent reports [13], lymphopenia is common and severe in some cases. Significantly high frequencies of severe cases were observed in elder patients with diabetes or hypertension (Tables 1). The clinical characteristics of these patients are similar to those reported in previous studies.[2], [3], [17].",

            "text": "After the discussion of the clinical features of COVID-19, we analyzed the immunological characteristics of peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19. In the present study, our results first proved our hypothesis and indicated that elevated NLR was an independent prognostic biomarker that affected pneumonia progression in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the integration of elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) to prognostic nomograms may lead to improved prediction. Our findings were consistent with those of previous studies on the relationship between NLR and prognosis of many other infectious diseases [14]. The following reasons may account for the findings. On the one hand, neutrophil (NEU)is a major component of leukocyte population that activates and migrates from the venous system to the immune organ or system. NEU releases large amounts of reactive oxygen species that can induce cell DNA damage and free the virus from the cells. Thus, antibody dependent cell mediated cell (ADCC) may kill the virus directly, expose virus antigen, and stimulate cell-specific and humoral immunities [15]. In addition, NEU interacts with distinct cell populations and produces numerous cytokines and effector molecules, such as circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF stimulates tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis [16]. Compared with normal tissues, VEGF-A and VEGF-C have significantly higher expressions in COVID-19 patients [17], and the reduced expression of VEGF and VEGFR contributes to markedly inhibited tissue and organ damage. Furthermore, NEU can be triggered by virus-related inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma factors, produced by lymphocyte and endothelial cells [18], [19], [20], [21]. On the other hand, human immune response triggered by viral infection mainly relies on lymphocyte [22], whereas systematic inflammation significantly depresses cellular immunity, which significantly decreases CD4+ T lymphocytes and increases CD8+ suppressor T lymphocyte [23]. Thus, virus-triggered inflammation increased NLR. Elevated NLR promoted COVID-19 progression. The clinical symptoms were increasingly severe, and the progress from admission to ICU, cure and discharge, or mechanical ventilation was rapid.",

The optimal threshold at 3.3 for NLR showed a superior prognostic possibility of clinical symptoms to change from mild to severe, which had the highest of sensitivity and specificity and the largest of AUC. When age \u226549.5 years old and NLR\u22653.3, 46.1% of the COVID-19 patients with mild disease will become severe, and the mean time is 6.3 days. So, these patients must be closely attended by clinicians. By contrast, when age<49.5 years old and NLR<3.3, COVID-19 patients with mild disease can be cured and discharged at approximately 13.5 days.The difference included numerous COVID-19 patients from a different geographic region and race may be an important factor that contribute to this phenomenon.NLR was a very useful indicator, and its clinical application was mainly seen in tumor-related diseases [24], autoimmune diseases [25], bacterial infectious pneumonia [26], [27], and tuberculosis [28].It could also be seen in other diseases, such as secondary pulmonary infectious diseases [29].In addition, other scholars had shown that NLR was an early new marker of aiv-h7n9 infection in patients [30].However, the application of NLR in other viral pneumonia was rarely reported.In our study, we found that NLR can be used as a prognostic factor for covid-19. Finally, the findings of this study indicate that elevated NLR is an independent prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 patients. NLR can increase evaluated capacity for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the usable NLR and age are recommended as practical tools to assess prognosis and to evaluate the severity of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients",
