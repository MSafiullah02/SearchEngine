Outpatients having unstable symptoms or considered high-risk for events or hospital admission maybe considered \u201curgent\u201d and treated after agreement between local hospital administration and Cardiology units.ii)Acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI/UNSTABLE ANGINA)oThere are many considerations regarding whether a catheter procedure should be performed or how rapidly it is done for these patientsoThere is no randomised controlled trial evidence (Cochrane review) that an early invasive approach reduces death or non-fatal myocardial infarction in this setting [8]. However, there is a reduction in recurrent MI and angina and re-hospitalisation which is important in unstable patientsoInvasive management may facilitate early discharge especially in those with medical therapy refractory angina or high-risk anatomy such as L main disease on CTCAoThere is no evidence to support the use of early invasive coronary angiography amongst patients with 4th Universal definition [9] Type II myocardial infarction, acute myocardial injury with troponin elevation without significant delta but clinical decision on a case-by-case basis should be made. Echocardiography may be a useful tool in this context.oCOVID-19 \u201cLow exposure risk\u201d can be brought to the catheter laboratory with staff observing appropriate PPE during procedure performance (may be routine care in this case) and cleaning procedures applied as per usual practice.oCOVID-19 \u201chigh exposure risk\u201d should only be brought into the catheter laboratory if there is a strong indication that urgent cardiac catheterisation would alter their short-term prognosis, ie clear evidence of ongoing severe ischaemia by the presence of i)symptoms and ECG changes refractory to medical therapy, orii)haemodynamic instability\noWhen patients are in the unknown category, for example, non-English speaking patient and there is an urgent clinical need, it is appropriate to treat as \u201chigh exposure risk\u201d of COVID-19.oPatients who are clinically stable should be cleared of ongoing COVID-19 infection (asymptomatic and COVID-19 PCR negative) before being considered for invasive coronary angiographyoPatients with severe pneumonia or ARDS should not be brought to the catheter laboratory as multi-disciplinary management discussions are likely necessary (eg escalation to intubation or haemodynamic support, risk/benefits/indications for invasive angiography/PCI or decision to palliate)oThe possibility of myocarditis should always be considered and possibly excluded using CTCA where possibleoPoint-of-care COVID-19 testing when available may reduce time required to stratify patient\u2019s COVID-19 risk but the accuracy of this has not been demonstrated in practiceiii)Acute coronary syndrome (STEMI)oPatients with \u201clow exposure risk\u201d of COVID-19 can be brought to the catheter lab with appropriate PPE and cleaning procedures applied as per usual practiceoIn units where staffing levels are compromised and primary PCI cannot be offered (including lack of PPE) then fibrinolysis may be appropriate if patients are lysis-eligibleoIn busy primary PCI units, simultaneous presentations of 2 or more STEMI patients is not infrequent. In this situation, it is unlikely that more than 1 patient will receive primary PCI (time delay with PPE, terminal cleaning time, avoid contamination of a \u201cclean Lab\u201d, lowered staffing levels), then fibrinolysis would be an optionoFibrinolytic agents should be made available where patients are likely to be treated (eg Emergency departments, coronary care units, catheter laboratories)oCardiologists should re-familiarise themselves with the indications and contraindications of fibrinolytic agents they are using (commonly TNK-tPA single bolus weight-adjusted dosing)oFibrinolytic therapy could be considered in lytic-eligible patients with \u201cHigh exposure\u201d risk of COVID-19 as suggested by Sichuan Provincial people\u2019s hospital flow chart [10] (see also protocols from Cairns hospital, Nepean Hospital, Eastern Heart Clinic and Zaman et al.).oLengthy treatment delay in delivering cardiac catheterisation is likely to arise due to the need for proper infection control procedures and PPE need (time donning PPE, terminal cleaning between procedures. See practical considerations below).oIndicated fibrinolytic treatment should be delivered within key performance targets (30 min \u201cDoor-to-Needle\u201d or \u201cDoor-to-Lysis\u201d time).oIf fibrinolysis is used for STEMI, patients aged \u2265 75 years should receive \u00bd weight-adjusted TNK-tPA dose with clopidogrel given (n.b.: omit the loading dose and use 75 mg daily) [11] as Ticagrelor should not be given at the time of fibrinolysis administration. Enoxaparin should be given at a dose of 30 mg IV bolus (<75 years) and then 1 mg/kg SCI BD except for patients \u226575 years where enoxaparin is given at 0.75 mg/kg SCI BD with no IV bolus [11]\no\u201cHigh exposure risk\u201d COVID-19 patients should only be brought into the catheter laboratory if there is a strong indication that urgent cardiac catheterisation would alter their short-term prognosis ie clear evidence of ongoing severe ischaemia by the presence of i)Symptoms and ECG changes refractory to medical (or fibrinolytic) therapy, orii)Haemodynamic instabilityiii)Large STEMI e.g. left main/anterior territory or inferior territory with hypotension or ischaemic arrhythmia\noPatients with severe pneumonia or ARDS should not be brought to the catheter laboratory and multi-disciplinary management discussions are likely necessary (eg escalation to intubation or haemodynamic support, risk/benefits of invasive angiography/PCI or decision to palliate)oThe possibility of myocarditis should be considered and possibly excluded using CTCA where possibleoEchocardiography is also useful and hand-held devices may be advantageous because of their ease-of-use and simpler cleaning (eg GE V-scanTM and Philips LumifyTM).iv)Structural interventionsa)\nTAVI \u2013 the patient group in question can be very elderly and are already vulnerable to death from infections. The overall value and clinical urgency of TAVI would require joint decision making between Heart team/TAVI implanter/referring cardiologist/patient and the host institution. TAVI offers shortened hospital stays and reduced morbidity compared to surgical Aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Compared to SAVR, TAVI may reduce demand for ICU and anaesthetic services during a pandemic. If TAVI is performed, pre-procedural screening and COVID-19 PCR may aid in reducing risk to staff. Although a significant proportion of TAVI are done under conscious sedation, GA and intubation is a consideration especially to mitigate viral spread in the event of unforeseen intubation or CPR requirement.b)\nMitral Clip \u2013 unstable patients could be considered if resources allow, lower risk patients should be postponedc)\nPFO and ASD closures \u2013 postponement recommendedd)\nLAA closure \u2013 postponement recommendede)\nOther \u2013 postpone unless urgent in-hospital indication\n",
