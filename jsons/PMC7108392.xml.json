As negative controls, water and a nasopharyngeal swab from an individual without respiratory symptoms were used in each analytical session.

The RT-PCR assay was validated through participation in an external quality assessment (QCMD 2006 Rhinovirus & Coronavirus RNA EQA Pilot Study, Glasgow, UK), where HCoV-NL63 was detected in all positive samples included in the panel.",

The phylogenetic analysis of S gene nucleotide sequences is shown in Fig. 3\n. Besides the 5 patients described in Fig. 2 (indicated as Southern-Central Italy), 7 additional patients identified in Pavia (indicated as Northern Italy) had S gene sequence data available, and were included in this analysis, together with 12 French isolates and 2 prototype isolates whose sequences were available in GenBank. From this tree it was not possible to identify any cluster with bootstrap values >80.

This frequency is consistent with prevalence data from previous studies, ranging from 1.0% to 9.3% (Arden et al., 2005, Bastien et al., 2005a, Bastien et al., 2005b, Chiu et al., 2005, Ebihara et al., 2005, Kaiser et al., 2005, Kuypers et al., 2007, Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005, Suzuki et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2005, van der Hoek et al., 2005). Due to the lack of matched healthy subjects for comparison, it is not possible to attribute any causal role to HCoV-NL63 in LRT diseases. Nevertheless, the following points can be derived from our results: (a) HCoV-NL63 was detected in LRT secretions of a small number of adult patients with clinically overt LRT disease; however, it is not possible to rule out that the virus detected could actually derive from contamination by upper respiratory tract secretions; (b) HCoV-NL63 is often combined with other respiratory viruses, in agreement with previous data (van der Hoek et al., 2006); in fact, 3 out 10 HCoV-NL63 positive samples were co-infected with HRV and 1 with adenovirus; these findings raise the possibility that HCoV-NL63 may be only a bystander virus present in people with LRT disease due to other causative agents, rather than directly being involved in the disease aetiology; in addition, our numbers are too low to draw any conclusion on the role of immunosuppression on prevalence and clinical presentation of HCoV-NL63 infection; (c) temporal distribution of HCoV-NL63 positive samples (Fig. 1) is consistent with winter seasonality of the infection, as previously reported (Arden et al., 2005, Bastien et al., 2005a, Ebihara et al., 2005, Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2005, van der Hoek et al., 2005).",
