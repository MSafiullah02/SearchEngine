To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of 27 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is quantified. 28 29 Keywords: COVID-19; asymptomatic cases; relative transmissibility 30 31 32 33 Main text 35 Nishiura et al (Nishiura et al, 2020 ) estimated the asymptomatic ratio of COVID-19 was 41.6% 36 (5 out of 12 confirmed cases) among 565 Japanese individuals evacuated from Wuhan, China. 37", "cite_spans": [{"start": 515, "end": 517, "text": "35", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 533, "end": 554, "text": "(Nishiura et al, 2020", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract 23"}, {"text": "Mao et al (Mao et al, 2020) reported that 2 out of 78 confirmed cases are asymptomatic. One 38 of the two cases showed RT-PCT positivity 15 th days after first diagnosis. Mizumoto et al 39 estimated that the 17.9% of cases on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship were asymptomatic 40 case during the outbreak in February 2020 (Mizumoto et al, 2020) . However, the 41 transmissibility of asymptomatic case is unclear, and the positive RT-PCT results only imply 42 the potential infectivity. It is important to study the pattern of viral shedding and live virus 43 isolation. W\u00f6lfel et al studied 9 hospitalized cases and found that live virus was isolated from 44 throat and lung-derived samples between 3 and 8 days after symptom onset (W\u00f6lfel et al, 45 2020) . When the RNA concentration is above 10 6 copies per ml (or equivalent Ct-value lower 46 than 24), but not from stool samples, despite of high virus RNA concentration. Above the 47 threshold, high RNA concentration yields high probability of live virus isolation. This 'dose-48 response' association highlights a patient's RT-PCR level should be higher than a threshold 49 to be effectively infectious. However, the mean infectious period (\u03b3 \u22121 ) of a symptomatic case may be longer than that of 102 an asymptomatic case hypothetically. Therefore, the combined effects of \u03c1 and \u03b3 \u22121 probably 103 lead to a higher reproduction number in the symptomatic group. 104 105 Additionally, Chen et al (Chen et al, 2020) showed that asymptomatic cases are more likely 106 to produce asymptomatic cases relatively speaking, since the 6 secondary cases from 107 asymptomatic primary cases consist 3 asymptomatic cases (50%). Whereas, 19 out of 126 108 (15%) are asymptomatic from symptomatic primary cases. The odds ratio (OR) is estimated 109 In summary, we conclude that the relatively transmissibility of asymptomatic case could be 127 significantly smaller than that of the symptomatic cases. The main contribution of (Chen et al, 128 2020) is that they raise the alarm of the existence of the transmissibility of the asymptomatic 129 cases. We remark that how efficient of the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases comparing 130 to symptomatic cases warrants more study. 131 132 133 Here we showed that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. 287 288 We also reported the asymptomatic case ratio in Hong Kong over time due to a large number 289 of young imported case. 290 291", "cite_spans": [{"start": 10, "end": 27, "text": "(Mao et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 322, "end": 344, "text": "(Mizumoto et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 732, "end": 755, "text": "(W\u00f6lfel et al, 45 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1467, "text": "(Chen et al, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2314, "end": 2317, "text": "288", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract 23"}, {"text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of 292 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is quantified. 293 294 295", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract 23"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of novel coronavirus infections (COVID-158 19)", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Miyama", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Estimating the asymptomatic 161 proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess 162 cruise ship", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mizumoto", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Kagaya", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Zarebski", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Chowell", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Eurosurveillance", "volume": "", "issn": "10", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "The enlightenment from two 165 cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2: is it safe after 14 days of 166 isolation?", "authors": [{"first": "Z", "middle": ["Q"], "last": "Mao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Wan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "He", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Hu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "SARS-CoV-2 169 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients", "authors": [{"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Zou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Ruan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Huang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Liang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Huang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [", ."], "last": "Hong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Q", "middle": [], "last": "Guo", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "New England Journal of 170 Medicine", "volume": "382", "issn": "12", "pages": "1177--1179", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Virological assessment of hospitalized patients 174 with COVID-2019", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Jones", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Vollmar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Rothe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Hoelscher", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "1--1", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China.

It was found that the viral 53 shedding pattern of COVID-19 patients resembles that of influenza patients rather than that 54 of SARS patients. The patterns of virus shedding in Zou et al and W\u00f6lfel et al are similar 55 (Zou et al, 2020, W\u00f6lfel et al, 2020). These results explained the shorter serial interval and 56 incubation period of COVID than that of SARS patients (Guan et al 2020, Du et al 2020). Till In Hong Kong asymptomatic cases are most likely from young imported cases and 60 in the recent month Hong Kong are facing a large number of relatively young imported casesWeekly asymptomatic case ratio (out of weekly confirmed cases) in Hong Kong. 64 Cases are grouped in weeks according to confirmation date. 65 66 The asymptomatic transmission of the COVID-19 is an important topic in understanding the 67 transmissivity of COVID-19 (Qiu, 2020). To our knowledge, the transmissibility of 68 asymptomatic cases has not been quantified. In a recent paper (Chen et al, 2020), Chen et al 69 investigated the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases among close contacts, and claimed no 70statistical difference between the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases versus that of 71 symptomatic cases. In this work, we re-analyses their dataset, and argue that the 72 transmissibility of asymptomatic cases appears lower than that of the symptomatic case respectively. The consecutive secondary infections consist 110 symptomatic 79 cases and 22 asymptomatic cases, seeTable 1. According to(Chen et  al, 2020), the number 80 of cases per contacts is calculated as (126/2001 =) 0.063 and (6/146 =) 0.041 for the 81 symptomatic and asymptomatic groups respectively, and then concluded that the difference 82 among the transmissibility of the two groups was not statistically significant. 83 84 Theoretically, the transmissibility (of an infectious disease) can be quantified by the 85 reproduction number (R). The R is defined the ratio of the case counts in the first generation 86 divided by those in the second generation, namely the number of secondary cases per index 87 case, and thus it is proportional to the risk of infection, i.e., force of infection. Hence, by 88 definition, the Rs can be calculated as (126/161 =) 0.78 and (6/30 =) 0.20 for the 89 symptomatic and asymptomatic groups respectively. Therefore, the risk ratio (RR) of 90 infectivity of a symptomatic group against that of the asymptomatic group is estimated at 3classic 'SEIR' modelling framework, the basic reproduction number, R 0 = \u03b2\u00b7\u03b3 \u22121 = 95 \u03c1\u03b8\u00b7\u03b3 \u22121 . Here, the \u03b3 \u22121 is the mean infectious period and the \u03b2 is effective contact rate. The \u03b2 can 96 be formulated as \u03b2 = \u03c1\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the average contact rate (common unit: contact per day) 97 and the \u03c1 is the risk (probability) of transmission per contact. Thus, the RR of the \u03c1 of 98 symptomatic group against the \u03c1 of the asymptomatic group is estimated at [(126/2001] / 99 (6/146) =] 1.5 (95%CI: 0.7\u22123.4). This indicates the symptomatic cases are likely to be more infectious than the asymptomatic cases though this difference is statistically insignificant. 101", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": ".4). We note that such a phenomenon may as well have occurred in the 110 COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020(Zhao et al,  111    2020), where a large proportion of asymptomatic cases were confirmed in the last 10 days of 112 the quarantine period. Namely, asymptomatic COVID-19 cases may likely contains limitation. Our analysis is conducted based on the contact tracing 116 surveillance data. Referring toTable 1, the close contacts per primary case of the 117 symptomatic group are [(2001/161) / (146/30) \u2212 1 =] 1.6-fold (95%CI: 0.8\u22122.6) more than 118those of the asymptomatic group. On the one hand, the difference could be merely due to the 119 difference in the contact pattern as pointed out in(Chen et al, 2020), which would not affect 120 our main results. On the other hand, this difference in the contact tracing might partially be 121 due to the difference in the contact tracing surveillance scheme implemented on the two 122 groups of the primary cases. In such case, the RR estimate may be higher than its true value. 123Cautious should be taken in interpreting these data, and understanding this gap would 124 improve our conclusions. 125 7 126", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Summary of the COVID-19 transmission and contact tracing in Ningbo from 197 January 21 to March 6, 2020.
