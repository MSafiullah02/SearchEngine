However, the detection of MERS-CoV RNA may overestimate the duration of shedding of replicative virus. Coronaviruses have a unique mechanism of discontinuous transcription with the synthesis of sub-genomic mRNAs (Sawicki et al., 2007). The MERS-CoV has at least seven distinct sub-genomic mRNA species and the detection of these indicates that the virus is replicative (Woo et al., 2016). The objectives of this study were to examine the duration for detecting MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA vs. genomic RNA in different respiratory specimens.",

Forward primer was elaborated from the leader sequence and backward primers of 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR)-S and 5\u2032UTR-N were from gene sequences coding for proteins S and N, respectively. The PCR reactions were performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. Sub-genomic mRNA was sequenced using a DNA Engine Tetrad 2 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) and the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA).
