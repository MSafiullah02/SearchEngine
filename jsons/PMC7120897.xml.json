            "text": "Transgenic and knockout animal models are the most effective tools to study cardiovascular hormone systems, since they reveal effects of changes in single components of these systems on the whole physiology. In particular, studies on the renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) have profited from this technology in recent decades [3, 5, 58]. Therefore, it was warranted to establish such models also for the novel RAS consisting of ACE2, Ang-(1-7), and Mas (Table 1). Despite that these three components comprise a common axis, distinct phenotypes of models with one of the components altered are expected since each of the three components has distinct additional functions independent from the two other molecules. ACE2, in particular, is a protein with several functions, a carboxypeptidase metabolizing a multitude of peptides, such as AngII and apelins, thereby either activating or inactivating them [104], a protein with a collectrin domain, which is involved in amino acid uptake in the gut [34, 95], and the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [45]. Moreover, also Ang-(1-7) may interact with other receptors than Mas and Mas may have other ligands or exert ligand-independent effects [4, 86].",

Based on the pleiotropic actions of this protein, mice lacking ACE2 areexpected to exhibit increased levels of AngII, decreased levels of Ang-(1-7) and tryptophan, as well as alterations in other peptide levels, which all may contribute to observed phenotypes. ACE2\u2212/y mice and also heterozygous female ACE2+/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to cardiac injury induced by pressure overload, AngII infusion, or diabetes [69, 109, 115, 125] and ACE2\u2212/y mice developed cardiac abnormalities at older age [17] probably due to an increased level of Ang II [68]. However, the spontaneous appearance of cardiac alterations could not be confirmed by another group and therefore remains controversial [31, 32, 125]. However, obesity-induced epicardial inflammation was worsened and caused cardiac dysfunction in ACE2\u2212/y mice [70]. Furthermore, in heart and skeletal muscle, ACE2 was involved in training-induced physiological hypertrophy [59].",

            "text": "There were also inconsistenciesin the reports about hypertension in ACE2\u2212/y mice, but it is now accepted that this phenotype is depending on the strain of mice appearing in C57BL/6 and FVB/N but not in 129 mice [32, 38, 77, 101]. ACE2-deficient mice on C57BL/6 background even developed a pre-ecclampsia-like syndrome when pregnant [8] and placental hypoxia and uterine artery dysfuncion caused fetal growth restriction in these animals [124]. In ACE2\u2212/\u2212 female mice, estrogen cannot inhibit obesity-induced hypertension in contrast to wild-type controls [114]. We and others have described AngII-dependent endothelial dysfunction in ACE2-deficient mice [49, 77], which probably mediated the prohypertensive phenotype. However, an increased sympathetic outflow may have also contributed [119]. On the other hand, ACE2 also degrades the vasodilator apelin peptides which consequently accumulate in ACE2\u2212/y mice and counteract the effects on the RAS [110]. Nevertheless, there were several other vascular effects of genetic ACE2-deletion such as a worsening of atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)- and low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice [63, 81, 99, 100] and an increased neointima formation after vascular injury [81], to which the endothelial dysfunction was a major contributor.",

Moreover, ACE2\u2212/y mice spontaneously developed glomerulosclerosis in older age [67] and were more susceptible to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury due to increased cytokine expression, inflammation, and oxidative stress [23]. Accordingly, genetic ACE2 deficiency led to accelerated nephropathy in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and Akita diabetic mice [91, 115]. Furthermore, knockout mice for ACE2 infused with AngII showed enhanced collagen I deposition in renal glomeruli and expression of genes related to fibrosis, such as smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and procollagen I, probably through activation of ERK1/2 and enhancement of protein kinase C levels [133]. ACE2-deficient mice also showed a worse outcome in shock-induced kidney injury [127], chronic hepatic injury [66], liver steatosis [12, 64], and cerulein-induced pancreatitis [48].",

This included hypertension induced by peripheral infusions of AngII [26] and by desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt treatment [118], cardiac hypertrophy elicited by AngII [25], coronary ligation-induced chronic heart failure [120], and stroke triggered by middle cerebral artery occlusion [14, 132]. In another model, the ACE2 transgene was flanked by loxP sites and it could therefore be specifically deleted in distinct brain regions by the local injection of Cre-recombinase-expressing adeno-associated viruses to assess the relevance of these areas for the blood pressure increase after DOCA/salt treatment. Such experiments revealed the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the subfornical organ as important but not exclusive contributors to hypertension development [117]. The shift in the balance between Ang-(1-7) and AngII in brain regions important for cardiovascular control modulated local NO and ROS production as well as cyclooxygenase-mediated neuroinflammation [97] and likely caused the beneficial effects of ACE2 in the brain. Accordingly, the AngII-dependent deleterious effects on brain tissues observed in double transgenic mice expressing human angiotensinogen and human renin were mitigated in triple transgenic animals additionally expressing human ACE2 [14, 131].",

However, Esteban and coworkers found that Mas knockout mice presented an attenuation of renal damage in the unilateral ureteral obstruction and in the renal ischemia/reperfusion model [22]. The authors reported that Ang-(1-7) infusion led to NF-\u03baB activation and inflammation via Mas. In contrast, Kim et al. showed protective effects of Ang-(1-7) infusion in the same model [40] and no aggravation of renal injury produced by kidney ischemia/reperfusion was observed in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice [6]. Moreover, Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from adriamycin-induced renal injury, again confirming the protective actions of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis of the RAS in the kidney [94]. The discrepancy between the studies remained unresolved, but anti-inflammatory and protective actions of Mas have repeatedly been described also in other organs: Ang-(1-7) protected from intracranial aneurysm only in wild-type but not in Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice [73]. Mas deficiency promoted atherosclerosis and autoimmune encephalitis by affecting macrophage polarization and migration [33] and by increasing vascular intima proliferation [2]. The effects on macrophages and other leukocytes were probably also the reason for the higher susceptibility of Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice in an endotoxic shock model [65, 96]. Moreover, Mas\u2212/\u2212 mice presented aggravated inflammatory pain [16] and allergic pulmonary inflammation [51].",

Using this method, Ang-(1-7) was overexpressed in transgenic rats (TGR(A1-7)3292) using the CMV promoter [28]. These animals mainly expressed the peptide in the testis, which nevertheless significantly increased plasma levels of Ang-(1-7). As a consequence, total peripheral resistance was decreased together with increases in the blood flow to several organs. Nonetheless, the animals remained normotensive, probably since they exhibited an improved pumping function of the heart [11]. These cardiac effects also protected the heart from pressure and ischemia-induced damage [84] as well as from DOCA-induced diastolic dysfunction [19]. A part of these effects may be due to alterations in autonomic regulation observed in these rats [18]. The increased levels of plasma Ang-(1-7) exerted antinatriuretic actions in the kidney resulting in reduced urinary flow and increased urinary osmolality [28]. Furthermore, TGR(A1-7)3292 rats exhibited metabolic improvements such as decreased plasma lipid levels, improved glucose tolerance, less fat tissue, decreased lipogenesis, and less cafeteria-diet-induced obesity [9, 57, 87, 89]. Moreover, these rats presented a reduction in anxiety-like behavior [39] and in the response to stress [60].",
