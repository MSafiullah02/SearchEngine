The initially isolated strains may appear like fi lament in a diameter of about 20 nm and length of 300-3000 nm. The hemagglutinin protuberance is a homotrimer composed of 3 non-covalently bound protein molecules, and the neural aminase presents with homotetramer made up by head and stem like a mushroom. The structures of the virus are subsequently envelope, matrix protein, and viral core from inside to outside. The surface glycoprotein club-shaped hemagglutinin (HA) and neural aminase (NA) are embedded into the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope together with ion channel protein. Matrix protein binds to the inner surface of viral envelope and associates with the helical ribonucleoprotein of the viral core to form a layer of membrane-like structure to protect the viral core. RNP comprises nucleocapsid protein (NP), three polymerases (PB1, PB2, PA), and eight viral RNA segments.",

However, infl uenza virus could only recognize specifi c sialic acid molecules on host cell membranes. Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal binding on the membrane of human respiratory tract mucous cells is key to infection of humans by avian infl uenza virus. Hyaluronic acid (HA) of the virus combines with host cell receptors and by pinocytosis mediated by such receptors and then enters coated pits which further internalizes HA into coated vesicle. Then the coated vesicle with viruses generates endosome which combines with lysosome to form endosomic lysosome. The acidic pH value inside endosome lysosome changes HA structure and decreases the aggregation force of trimer to expose segment N of HA and fuse with plasma membrane. Besides, the low pH value activates M2 ion channel and facilitates H+ to enter virion, thus decreasing pH value inside the virus. Therefore, the direct interaction between M1 and NP is damaged to free RNP, thus resulting in uncoating of the virus. Thereafter, the genome of the virus is released into the cell plasma and again transported to the nucleus. Both the transcription and repli-cation of the infl uenza virus RNA segments take place in the host cell nuclei, and RNP must enter the cell nuclei.",

Infl uenza virus falls into type A, type B, and type C in light of the antigen of nucleoprotein (NP). Infl uenza virus type A could be further divided into subtypes according to the antigen difference of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) embedded in the lipid bilayer outer membrane. Avian infl uenza virus (AIV) of different types or subtypes demonstrates varying pathogenicity due to the difference in viral genome structure and sequence expressing protein polypeptide. Some mutant viruses could even surmount genus and order barriers to infect humans, such as H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, and H7N9, among which H5N1 or H7N9 infection could induce severe conditions and high mortality. HA on the outer membrane of infl uenza virus type A plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of AIV. HA, as the main component of envelope spike, is key to viral attachment and transmembrane process and could stimulate generation of neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity to ward off viral infection and disease. In the course of infection, HA, could be hydrolyzed into peptide chain HA1 and HA2, with the former able to combine with host cell receptors and the latter as a critical subunit to mediate fusion of the virus and host cell membranes. Therefore, the infl uenza virus could integrate with host cell receptors mediated by HA1 and fuse with cell membrane mediated by HA2 to promote release of ribonucleoprotein (RNP).",

Coronal imaging visualized remarkable pneumatosis at the neck, mediastinum, and the periphery of the heart and large blood vessels shaped change or mutual fusion at the periphery of stellate sign. In the advanced phase, the femur head becomes fragmented and deformed, and the absorption of sclerotin between fragmented bones presents irregular low-density area, with the stellate sign absent. Based on MRI presentations, aseptic necrosis of the femur head may be divided into the following four phases: Phase I shows homogenous or inhomogeneous low-signal areas adjacent to joints above the femur head on weighted T1 and T2 imaging; phase II manifests wedge-shaped mixed low-signal band; phase III is typical of sequestrum crescent sign and cortical collapse; phase IV manifests phase III signs accompanied by joint degeneration and joint space stenosis. Besides, apart from the most common ischemic necrosis of the femoral head, osteomyelitis is also documented, mostly at the femur, which presents irregular low-signal area on T2 weighed imaging (Fig. 3.19 ).
