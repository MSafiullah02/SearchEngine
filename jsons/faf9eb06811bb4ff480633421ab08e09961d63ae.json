            "text": "The area of molecular diagnostics has developed in a big way following the successful sequencing of the human genome in 2003. This was followed by the sequencing of the genomes of major infectious disease-causing organisms. This allowed the identification of unique sequences of microorganisms that could be used as markers to detect the presence of these microorganisms in the human body. Currently, infectious disease testing accounts for over three-quarters of total molecular diagnostics revenues internationally, most of which is due to increased disease burden of infectious diseases such as influenza, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and HIV. This project will develop the assays for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics in the much-neglected area of infectious disease diagnostics. We plan to systematically develop assays for the common and rare bacterial or viral pathogens with the objective of subsequently out licensing the tests to pathological laboratories. We will also develop rapid assays for detection of emerging infectious diseases. For example, the newly emerging influenza strains can be detected very accurately by PCR-based tests. This will open up a huge business opportunity and help catch up with the emerging international trend of next generation of diagnostics-assisted therapy.",

As applied to infectious diseases diagnostics, it involves the amplification of the genetic material of the infectious disease-causing microorganism to a detectable level proving the presence of the microorganism in the blood or other bodily fluid. These reactions are easy to perform and are quick and reliable tests to detect virtually all infectious diseases pathogens having either DNA or RNA as genetic material. As opposed to ELISA-based tests that detect the immune response of the body, the PCR-based test will detect the presence of minute amounts of microorganismso that an infection can be detected at a much earlier stage.",

Reliability: As PCR-based diagnostics are direct tests that detect the presence of infectious microorganisms, if done properly are extremely reliable and gives consistent reproducible results. The positive result is a single band of a specific size at a particular location on agarose gel. 2. Specificity: If the oligonucleotides are designed well, the PCR reaction will give a single band specific for a particular microorganism. In the absence of the microorganism or in the presence of a different microorganism, no such band will be seen. 3. Sensitivity: As a PCR reaction amplifies even minuscule amounts of genetic material. It is this 100-1000 times sensitive than ELISA-based techniques that detects signals once the infection is well established. Furthermore, after the waning of the infection, the PCR signal will drop, but the immune signals will remain giving an erroneous result. 4. Flexibility: Multiple reactions can be run in a single tube giving a result that appears as multiple marker bands for the same microorganism for better cross checking of the results. 5. Speed: A PCR reaction is relatively quick to perform and as many as 96 samples can be analysed in a single run. If the whole plate is run, it also is much cheaper than conventional assays.",

Lack of hands on technical knowledge among the established pathologists of this region: Partly due to commercial considerations and partly due to lack of adequate molecular biology training in the medical colleges, the pathologists do not have the expertise to carry out these tests as well as interpret these results. As a result, these tests have not gained in popularity. 3. Presence of an organized lobby for the promotion of ELISA-based tests: The manufacturers and the distributors of the diagnostics kits in the city have a strong lobby that opposes the introduction of newer diagnostic tests that will replace the existing tests. This includes Government regulatory authorities that approve the tests. 4. Competition amongst pathological laboratories that cuts into each other: The competition amongst laboratories having the tests and those not having the tests results in sending of the tests to laboratories outside Kolkata to do the simple tests. A simple independent laboratory can tap into this business potential. 5. Lack of validated tests suitable for Indian conditions: All the reagents are imported from abroad and there are no validation studies carried out to see if they will be suitable for conditions here. Hence tests often turn out to be unreliable, as a result of which the medical community cannot trust these. India promises to be a big market for molecular diagnostics primarily due to increasing health awareness, demand and affordability for quality healthcare. This is further compounded by the fact that the number of insured lives have increased recently and medico-legal implications necessitate conducting such tests. Furthermore, 70% of the decisions of doctors are based on lab reports and such facilities are increasingly becoming available in towns and rural areas.",

An improvement to this is also being carried out where the test results can be viewed colourimetrically, where the positive results can be indicated by the appearance of a single colour in a tube. The ability of a lab having the technical ability and the single-minded focus and determination in the area of PCR-based diagnostics will transform these tests into commercially viable tests that can compete with the other tests already available in the market.

Various volatile molecules and water diffuse out of the cells lining the airspaces in the lung, the airways and the mouth. Analysis of exhaled breath also revealed the presence of non-volatile particles [4] . These droplets may be formed due to turbulence in the airways, changes in surface tension in the alveoli and airways or from the airway lining fluid (ALF). A collection of these gases in the exhaled air forms the EBC. EBC comprises of water vapour and a variety of volatile such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons and non-volatile (such as urea, GSH, leukotrienes, prostanoids, and cytokines) [1, 3] components. The composition of EBC is not completely understood. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is increasingly gaining popularity in the field of lung diseases due to its non-invasive nature. Various oxidative stress markers and inflammatory mediators such as inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and oxidized glutathione may be estimated using EBC. Therefore it may be useful for detecting and discovering novel markers for different lung diseases. However, the small amount of EBC obtained from each patient poses a hurdle in its application for detection of various lung ailments.

Its design also prevents salivary contamination [11] . It can also be used for determining pH of EBC using pHTube \u00ae (Respiratory Research, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) [11] . For pH measurement, sufficient volume may be collected in about a minute [11] . The collected EBC still needs to be taken to the laboratory for biochemical tests. Comparison of EBC collected from RTube and EcoScreen reported higher volumes of the condensate and detection of lipid and protein mediators in EBC collected from EcoScreen. Further studies to address this issue are required. Standardization of the sterilization protocol for EBC equipment is necessary to reduce cross contamination. Currently, the equipment is sterilized using an antibacterial solution such as sodium hypochlorite for 1 h followed by rinses with water. The effect of different collection material on the components of EBC is unknown. In EcoScreen the condenser is coated with Teflon \u00ae (E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Inc., Washington, DE) to avoid loss of molecules by adhering to the service. Borosilicate glass coating was found to be better than silicone, aluminium, polypropylene and Teflon for albumin detection. These results suggest that the condenser material needs to be according to the molecules/compounds to be detected. Further use of separate sensors for simultaneous collection of different compounds such as hydrogen peroxide [12] and inflammatory mediators may be developed. Further effect of the antiseptic solutions used for cleaning and optimization of collection protocol to enable simultaneous collection of material is required (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4).",

The respiratory tract contains several different types of cells (airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, smooth muscle cells and mast cells) which contain NOS. A ROS, superoxide anion (O 2 \u00c0 ), reacts with NO and forms the unstable and highly reactive peroxynitrite (ONOO-). The peroxynitrite anion aids in the nitrosation of tyrosine, or its residues, and forms 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), which can be measured by HPLC or MS. NO also reacts with thiols, like glutathione, cysteine, and protein thiol residues, to form S-nitrothioles (RS-NO). RS-Nos can be measured colourimetrically.

In several cell types, H 2 O 2 can be produced by superoxide dismutase (SOD) through conversion of the superoxide anion. H 2 O 2 can be released from both inflammatory and structural cells including neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells. H 2 O 2 can be detected in EBC but is probably more unstable than other oxidative stress markers like isoprostanes. Like the RNS, H 2 O 2 is found to increase in people affected with asthma, COPD and ARDS. Treatment with montelukast did not have any effect on the H 2 O 2 content in EBC of mildly asthmatic patients, whereas treatment with triamcinolone acetonide reduced the H 2 O 2 content. A limitation in the assessment of H 2 O 2 in the EBC is its instability, which means that samples have to be collected fresh, and frozen for later assays. H 2 O 2 is measured by assays (colourimetric, chemiluminescent and fluorimetric assays). Another biomarker of oxidative stress is malondialdehyde (MDA), which is formed from the degradation of polyunsaturated lipids by ROS. MDA present in EBC can be measured, in the range of 10 nM, by HPLC. Oxidative stress or inflammation in the respiratory tract leads to increase in ROS and RNS, which are used as indicators. Patients with asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have high levels of H 2 O 2 , RS-NO, NO 2 \u00c0 , NO 3 \u00c0 , 3-NT and MDA in the EBC. Apart from these, the airway lining fluid (ALF) also has antioxidant compounds like cysteine (Cys) and Glutathione (GSH).

            "text": "Assessment of EBC is a non-invasive technique used to sample the lower airways. Collection of EBC involves tidal breathing (inhalation & exhalation during restful breathing) into a collection device, which is chilled. The chilled collection device allows the water vapour in the EBC to condense and be collected. Quantitation of different mediators and factors can be done from the collected condensate. The mediators that are quantified originate from the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) that gets mobilized during expiration [17] . Different inflammatory mediators, from simple pro-oxidant molecules to larger proteins, are found in the EBC of patients with diseases like COPD, asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite being a promising and non-invasive technique, several questions have been raised regarding its methodologies that have delayed its adoption as a clinical technique. There is no standardized method for the collection of EBC, and different investigators have used collection devices ranging from Teflon tubing, convection cylinders and ice baths. Thus, before the use of EBC is mainstreamed, a standard method for collection must be determined. Nowadays, EBC collection devices, like RTubeTM from Respiratory Research, Inc., USA, and EcoScreen, from Viasys, are commercially available [10] . There is also the problem of dilution of EBC. The respiratory droplets get diluted, often as much as 10,000 folds, when they are collected in the water-saturated exhaled breath [17] . This poses a problem because mediators and soluble factors are already present at very low concentrations which can be detected by only few, very-sensitive tests. Detection is especially a problem in case of proteins, as they may not get aerosolized. This dilution may differ among test subjects, making it difficult to standardize the test. The American Thoracic Society, as well as the European Respiratory Society, have issued guidelines for the collection of EBC which have attempted to address the above-mentioned issues [18] . It has been suggested that standardization of the EBC mediators may be done by measuring the quantities of non-volatile cations in the EBC [17] . This is considered to give an idea about the degree of dilution, as cation levels in the ELF remain somewhat constant. However, for this method to work, the EBC has to be lyophilized and ammonia removed from it, which may lead to changes in the levels of the biomarkers. Regardless of these issues, EBC analysis has the potential to be a powerful technique for assessing the lung diseases.",

Currently, nNO is measured using the portable analyzer, MINO, and the results have been validated against results from standard chemiluminescent assays. Thus, this technique, which is non-invasive, easy and quick, can be used as a tool for diagnosis. Generally, nNO levels range from 400 to 900 parts per billion (ppb). Paranasal sinuses produce high levels of nNO (up to 25 ppm) by the action of inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) of the epithelium.

As a result, no one technique is enough for the measurement of the different molecules. Presently, one main limitation of EBC measurement is the very low concentration of some biomarkers, thus limiting their measurement due to assays which are not sensitive enough. It is possible that, as potent antibodies are developed, more sensitive assays will also ensue. H 2 O 2 can be easily detected in real time using electrodes coated with horseradish peroxidase. Other similar enzyme-based assays may be developed for the lipid mediators, like the 8-isoprostane.

EBC of COPD patients have higher levels of H 2 O 2 compared to healthy controls, and the levels further rise with exacerbation of the disease [19] . The H 2 O 2 levels, measured by EBC, can be correlated with the severity of the disease measured by the FEV1/FVC ratio [19] . H 2 O 2 levels in the EBC of COPD patients can be reduced by n-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of H 2 O 2 in COPD. H 2 O 2 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of COPD, as an indicator of neutrophilic inflammation, since neutrophils are predominant in the airways in COPD [19] . Also, measurement of H 2 O 2 in EBC can be done easily using inexpensive chemicals.\u2022 Isoprostanes:Isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds that are formed by the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of essential fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, without the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Chemically stable, and formed in vivo, they are considered to be markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in humans. Of the isoprostanes, 8-isoprostane has been thoroughly studied as a marker for oxidative stress in human lung diseases. It may be important in the development of COPD. Several studies have shown that the levels of 8-isoprostane are higher in the EBC of COPD patients than in normal healthy controls [10, 19] . Its levels have been found to increase with exacerbation of the disease. However, measurement of pulmonary function with FEV1/FVC showed no correlation between pulmonary function and 8-isoprostane [10, 19] . COPD patients who are also smokers have higher levels of 8-isoprostane than non-smoking COPD patients [10] . Thus, it can be used as a marker for underlying inflammation of the airways. Isoprostane can be measured using a commercial immunoassay kit.\u2022 Other mediators: Other markers of oxidative stress, like aldehydes, have been found in EBC, but their instability and lack of specificity limit their use clinically. EBC of COPD patient has a lower pH than normal, and thus, can be used as a marker for airway inflammation [19] . Cytokines are also found in the EBC, but in very low levels (in the range of pg/ml). The level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) was found to be higher in COPD patients.The range of markers found in the EBC of COPD patients shows the potential of EBC as a tool for diagnosis and/or treatment of COPD.",

Leukotrienes (LTs) and 8-isoprostanes, which are eicosanoids, can be measured in the EBC by enzyme immunoassays or by GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). Cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) have been found in the EBC of asthmatic patients, the levels of which seem to be correlated with the severity of the disease, and are found to be reduced by anti-inflammatory drugs. 8-isoprostane is also found in the EBC of asthmatic patients and is correlated with the",
