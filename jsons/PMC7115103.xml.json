Distinct organisms interact by providing a habitat or ecological niche for one another, by serving as a nutritional source, by enabling reproduction (in the case of pollination, for example), or by providing metabolic functions, morphological traits, and behavioral features neither of the partners are able to develop on their own. When organisms engage in a symbiotic association, both the host (the larger partner in the association) and the symbiont(s) (the smaller partner) often develop new features and sometimes form new individuals with characteristics not found in the individual organisms (Margulis 1991, 1998). Lichens, for example, result from a conjunctive symbiosis between a fungus (the mycobiont) and algae or cyanobacteria (the phycobiont).",

When distinct organisms live on the surface of other organisms (on their skin, the leafs or roots of plants, the gill of fish, the outer membrane of cells), the symbiosis is called ectosymbiosis; and when organisms live inside other living organisms (inside the cells, leaf cavities or roots of legumes, or inside the vascular, lymphatic or gastro-intestinal systems), it is called endosymbiosis. Symbiotic associations are also differentiated based upon actual (penetrating) physical contact between the host and symbiont (conjunctive symbiosis), or the mere living inside each other\u2019s vicinity (disjunctive symbiosis) (Albany 1998).",

The origin of photosynthetic life forms (organisms that produce oxygen as a waste product), led to the great oxygenation event which commenced somewhat 2.4 billion years ago. The transition from a reducing atmosphere to an oxygen-rich atmosphere led to the oxygen catastrophe, i.e., the first major extinction event where obligate anaerobe life forms that evolved in the Hadean and Archean became severely threatened. The great oxygenation event was a precondition for oxygen-respiring life forms to evolve, and it triggered the Huronian glaciation (the first ice age). These environmental changes were also one of the triggers for the evolution of symbiogenesis out of permanent symbiosis, where, as an adaptive environmental response, various life forms increased in size and sought permanent shelter in one another to find protection against the devastating environmental conditions.",

By building on earlier work of Andreas Schimper, the Russians pointed out that chloroplasts, organelles found in algae and plant cells, had evolved from cyanobacteria that engaged in long-term symbioses. The permanent endosymbiosis resulted in symbiogenesis: the cyanobacteria evolved into organelles, cellular structures that permanently reside inside the cells. With the Russians, hereditary symbiosis became understood as a causal agent in the evolution of new morphological features, and symbiogenesis was identified as an evolutionary mechanism whereby species evolve. A symbiogenetic origin for mitochondria, which are also eukaryotic organelles, was conjectured by Paul Portier in France (who identified them as \u201ccellular symbiotes\u201d), and in America by Ivan Wallin who adopted the notion of hereditary symbiosis and introduced the concept of \u201csymbionticism\u201d (Sapp 2003).\n",

Nonetheless, these plastids have been acquired repeatedly, often as primary, secondary, and tertiary\nendosymbiosis events. Eukaryotic organisms with chloroplasts in place and forming a primary endosymbiosis were completely engulfed by other eukaryotes where the engulfed organism, as a whole, started to function as a chloroplast. Products of this secondary endosymbiosis in turn have also been engulfed by other eukaryotes, a process called tertiary endosymbiosis (Archibald 2011, 2014). Symbiogenesis as an evolutionary mechanism therefore not merely evidences a pattern of reticulation, it also demonstrates a pattern of increased embedding, comparable to Russian dolls, though the dolls have different morphologies rather than being identical.  Mitochondria, in turn, have all evolved from proteobacteria with which they still share a high genetic similarity.",

Many viruses can also copy their genetic material into the genome of the host. Endogenous retroviruses or ERVs (Gifford and Tristem 2003; L\u00f6wer et al. 1996; Ryan 2009) are viruses that upon infection can horizontally insert their genetic material into their host genome. ERVs resemble retrotransposable elements (Nelson and Hooley 2004), and they are often classified as a subtype of the latter. ERVs make use of the genetic apparatus of the somatic cells, but they can also integrate in the genomes of the sex cells and nestle inside the germ line. Once they become part of the germ line, the genes become the subject of vertical transmission where they are passed on to future generations in a Mendelian fashion. It is now well established that the genomes of mammals contain bits and pieces of these viruses in regions that were previously designated as \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d The genomes that acquire retroviral genes, however, not merely serve as containers for the latter. On the contrary, the acquired retroviral genes often play crucial functional roles in developmental pathways. It has been proven that endogenous retroviruses played a significant role in the formation of the female placenta (Knerr et al. 2002; Sugimoto and Schust 2009). Evidence furthermore suggests that our human ancestors caught endogenous retroviruses from Neanderthals (Marchi et al. 2013). At least theoretically, it is likely that Neanderthals reciprocally caught some of our infectious diseases, which might have eventually contributed to their decline.",

Prions are infectious proteins that underlie mammalian neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease in bovines; as well Kuru in humans, and Scrapie in sheep. Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and BSE are also related in etiology and caused by similar prions. Prions are proteins that undergo post-translational, epigenetic changes in their three-dimensional folding structure. Thus, after the genetic code is transcribed and translated into proteins, the protein that makes up the prion undergoes further, non-genetically encoded alterations in form. What exactly causes the proteins to change form is still uncertain, but Spiroplasma bacteria have been implicated (Bastian et al. 2007). Once the proteins flip into prions and take on the altered morphological form, these prions can bind to the regular proteins and make them change form as well. The prion-induced disease is able to spread across the brain and causes neurodegenerative, spongiform diseases where the brain starts to shrink in size and morphologically starts to resemble a sponge.",

Anaerobe gut flora is known to contribute to digestion of certain food substances, they help build the colon walls, and they often protect their host against infections with less beneficial microbes (Backhed et al. 2005; Turnbaugh et al. 2007, 2009; Ley et al. 2006).

How we define organisms, groups, species, genera, or higher taxa requires reconceptualization that takes the numerous interactions that exist between organisms into account. It requires a basic reformulation of notions such as behavior, communication, fitness, adaptation, speciation, and extinction. Reticulate evolution has identified new units of evolution (such as hybrids, mobile genetic elements, symbionts, and holobionts), as well as levels of evolution. The \u201cenvironment\u201d is both abiotic as well as biotic. A multicellular organism is itself an entire community, from the intra-genetic and intracellular level all the way up to the outer layers that bound it.",

Some scholars plead for an integration and a revision of the synthesis, others deny the possibility and call out for a rupture with the Modern Synthesis. Only the future will tell and though this volume is (merely) of an introductory level, we do hope it will inspire scholars to engage in finding the answers to these fascinating questions.",

Species A\n\u2032 and B\n\u2032 are nonetheless genetically, morphologically, or behaviorally altered by the various crossings, transfers and symbiotic associations in time, possibly up to the point that they evolved into new species (species C and D). Bottom right Divergence by gene flow or introgression: During its divergence from species A, species B either regularly backcrosses with its parental species (introgression), or exchanges genes laterally (directly or via symbiosis), thereby causing both species to diverge in time. This leads to the evolution of a new species B, and also the parental species is genetically altered (species A\n\u2032), possibly up to the point that it evolved into a new species (species C)",
