In many, a prothrombotic state or coagulopathy is induced which can lead to pulmonary emboli, intracardiac thrombus and exacerbation of coronary artery disease. The data show that those with preexisting cardiovascular disease are at highest risk for complications which suggests that in addition to the mechanisms described above, the stress of infection can transform a heart failure or coronary artery disease patient from a compensated state quickly to an unstable state (2) . For example, the hypoxemia from acute respiratory distress syndrome will exacerbate the pre-existing cardiac disease. In the cases presented by Zhang and colleagues, it is likely that some or all of these patients had pre-existing cardiac disease based on features noted on the echocardiographic assessments of cardiac structure and function.",

We know that chest pain is a common occurrence in this infection. We are also learning that biomarkers of cardiac injury are elevated in many of the infected, critically ill patients (3) . While in other circumstance either one of these might trigger the request for a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), now we need to insure that performing the TTE will truly provide information not obvious on clinical assessment and that the results will assist in important treatment decisions. Thus, a pragmatic and practical approach is in order. While the echocardiogram might be of assistance, we need to ask if the use of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) and the exposure of additional personnel is justified. We also need to recognize that providing imaging services for this high-risk population will differ from our typical model. We should encourage focused exams to limit exposure time of the imager and also utilize cardiac point of care ultrasound (POCUS) by the clinical personnel who might already be in the room with these patients (thus conserving PPE).",

            "text": "From the paper by Ward and colleagues we see the impact that COVID-19 has had on echocardiography ordering, screening and performance at the University of Chicago (7). This analysis of utilization and appropriateness of TTE provides many important insights. First, from an echocardiography laboratory operations standpoint, it is notable that with hospital and state directives to defer elective procedures, the weekly volume of TTE has been markedly decreased (84% among outpatient studies in this report). This is similar to the experience at our institution, with the primary goal to help protect patients and hospital staff by minimizing non-essential travel and practicing rigorous social distancing. What impact deferring these studies will have on future patient outcomes is not clear. From a practical standpoint how busy echocardiography laboratories will ultimately reschedule these studies for patients remains to be seen. The pandemic has provided an unexpected opportunity for clinicians and procedural labs to focus on which studies are truly needed. Appropriate Use Criteria for echocardiography have been in existence for over a decade (8) and the subject of much clinical investigation, although integration into routine clinical practice has been varied. The COVID-19 pandemic mandated a change in workflow, and the University of Chicago authors instituted a protocol which involves physician review of all echocardiography referrals. This essentially eliminated \"rarely appropriate\" TTEs (down to 1%). While many echocardiography labs have physician or other clinician review of transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE), the volume of TTE has been a barrier for doing so for that modality. This paper shows that when given no choice, it can be done and improves patient selection for TTE. The sustainability of such a protocol after the pandemic is an obvious question, yet the principle that improved screening of ordered TTEs reduces inappropriate studies is a valuable lesson to carry forward.",

Specifically, the main risk considered is to the sonographers (or physicians) performing TTE, as the procedure requires prolonged and close contact with patients. Sonographer workplace safety has previously focused on areas such as radiation safety and ergonomic issues related to the nature of the work, although the COVID-19 situation has rightfully brought a new dimension to this discussion. The authors examined an alternative imaging protocol (limited TTE), which reduces imaging time and minimizes high risk exposure, and showed a significant increase in the use of limited TTE during the pandemic.",

This crisis has ironically forced us all to bring existing quality improvement initiatives to the forefront. Almost overnight, Cardiology Divisions have needed to enact new protocols to help strike a balance of optimal patient care, clinical workforce safety, and societal responsibility. Deferring echocardiography studies deemed non-urgent (or inappropriate) has greatly reduced volumes in an effort to protect patients and echocardiography laboratory staff. For the studies that should and must be done, evaluating limited imaging protocols and other modalities (POCUS) are well underway. This will provide an opportunity for needed real world study. Prior to the pandemic, there has been growing use of POCUS and guidelines written on its use (5) . The use of smaller ultrasound machines including hand-held devices have been deployed in this new work-flow model and it will be interesting whether such implementation sticks. Some have raised concerns that lack of uniform reporting and image storage for later review may be limiting factors to optimal adoption of this technology. We owe it to the patients being cared for during the pandemic, and to future patients, to rigorously evaluate the rapidly escalating incorporation of these technologies into clinical care. In an analogous fashion in clinical cardiology care, the use of virtual (video or telephone) visits is increasing rapidly by necessity and represents an area that can be studied to help guide optimal utilization in post-pandemic times.",

These are valuable lessons that in some form should be carried forward when the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, and perhaps we can emerge as a more efficient and patient-centered health care system that will prepare us for any future challenges that may arise.
