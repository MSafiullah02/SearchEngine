Although each of these threats has its own characteristics, its underlying network determines the spreading. To restrain the spreading, a widely used approach is the fragmentation of these networks through immunization, so that epidemics cannot spread. Here we develop an immunization approach based on optimizing the susceptible size, which outperforms the best known strategy based on immunizing the highest-betweenness links or nodes. We find that the network's vulnerability can be significantly reduced, demonstrating this on three different real networks: the global flight network, a school friendship network, and the internet. In all cases, we find that not only is the average infection probability significantly suppressed, but also for the most relevant case of a small and limited number of immunization units the infection probability can be reduced by up to 55%.",

Nowadays there is a possibility to reach every city in the world within at most a day, which allows for the evolution of a local disease to a global pandemic [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Crucial for fast global disease spreading is the international flight network [9, 10] . To avoid spreading through this network, significant effort is made by, e.g., screening passengers or canceling flights. Since it is unrealistic to examine all passengers, it is vital to apply the best possible immunization strategy in order to most effectively exploit limited resources, like available vaccines and man power. Different strategies to immunize nodes or links of a network have been studied in the past [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Targeted immunization strategies, in which nodes or links playing a special role in the network architecture are immunized first, have proven to be very effective [17] [18] [19] [20] . The strategy believed to be the most efficient is the targeted immunization based on immunizing the highest betweenness centrality nodes or links [17] . The adaptive betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths passing through the node or the link, recalculated for the network of non immunized nodes at each step of the immunization process.",

This is important since improving the effectiveness of immunization strategies even by a small amount can result in saving thousands of human lives. Based on percolation we developed a more efficient immu- * schnechr@ethz.ch nization strategy using the betweenness centrality measure [17] . We studied quantitatively the effectiveness of the improved strategy on real networks, the global airport network [21] , the friendship network in American schools [22] , and the internet at the level of service providers (point of presence, PoP) [23] , as well as on model networks. We study both cases of immunization, the immunization of nodes, which models, for instance, immunization of people or airports, and the immunization of links, modeling, for instance, prevention of direct contact between people or the performance of special checks and vaccinations on all flights between two specific airports. We find that, although very effective, the immunization strategy based on immunizing nodes or edges with the highest values of dynamically recalculated betweenness is not optimal. Starting from such a strategy, our approach reduces the risk of becoming infected on average by more than 10%, independent of the amount of immunization units for the real examples of airport, friendship, and internet networks. Moreover, for specific numbers of immunization units the improvement is even up to 55%. For model networks, the improvement is close to 30% on average, and a maximal improvement of over 80% can be obtained or up to 29% of immunization units can be saved.",

The color code represents the probability of becoming infected. Note that the average probability of becoming infected is 84% for random, 34% for betweenness, and 20% for our improved immunization method.

In our search for a more efficient immunization strategy of nodes or edges, we start from the efficient known strategy of high betweenness. First, we calculate the sequence in which nodes or edges would be immunized if the highbetweenness adaptive (HBA) immunization strategy [17] was used. To this end, we calculate the shortest path between all pairs of nodes and count how often a node or edge lies on a shortest path. This number defines its betweenness centrality. The node or edge with the highest contribution to the shortest paths is identified and immunized. Repeating this procedure with the remaining network of non immunized nodes until it vanishes leads to the high-betweenness immunization sequence.",

If the susceptible size does not increase when the new immunization sequence is used, the change in the sequence is accepted. The sequence is further improved by repeating the same procedure many times. To further improve our strategy, we use in addition an improving algorithm employing a population of immunization sequences. We start from 1000 equal highbetweenness immunization sequences and choose one of them randomly to perform a swap. If the susceptible size of the network after immunizing with the new sequence is not increased, it replaces the sequence from the population for which the network has the highest susceptible size. The final immunization sequence is the one with the lowest susceptible size. The basic algorithm for improving edge immunization sequences is demonstrated in Fig. 3 . Note that the algorithm uses the global knowledge of the network to achieve the final immunization sequence. The calculation of the initial sequence, which is based on the Starting from an initial immunization sequence (based on betweenness centrality), two randomly chosen edges (in this case the edge between nodes 5 and 9 and the edge between 3 and 7) are swapped in the immunization sequence.

We also analyze the case of the internet at the level of pointof-presence as well as two models, the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks [24] and scale-free networks [25] generated using the configurational model [26] . For a typical friendship network we show the results for a single school, since we found that the other 81 school networks we studied all behave in a qualitatively similar way. For all real networks we demonstrate the efficiency of our method for both link (Fig. 2) and node immunization (Fig. 5) . For the airline network, an infected airport implies that sick people arrive at or depart from it. Consequently immunization means identifying sick people and inhibiting their travel. For example, link immunization can be done by screening people on specific flights -as done in several countries (including Japan and China) during the SARS and swine flu epidemics -while in the case of node immunization all people at an airport are screened. A more drastic immunization would be the canceling of flights or even the shut down of entire airports. For the school network, link immunization corresponds to preventing direct contacts between students and node immunization can be performed by immunizing students or temporarily removing them from classes. For the internet, the screening of traffic between routers is equivalent to link immunization and the upgrade of the router soft-or hardware to node immunization. The efficiency of our method for improving immunization is evaluated by three different measures: modeling epidemic spreading using the SIR model, the saved immunization doses, and the susceptible size, which represents the upper limit of the number of infected individuals. First we analyze the probability for a single node (airport, student, router) to become infected. To study this probability we simulate a disease spreading model (SIR) on the global airline transportation network with N = 3666 airports and M = 27235 flight connections, a typical friendship network with N = 1461 students and M = 3875 friendship connections, and the internet with N = 1098 and M = 6089 connections. We simulate the SIR model [2, 5] with the parameters \u03b1 = 0.2 (probability that the infection spreads from an infected node to its neighbor in one time step) and \u03b2 = 0.05 (probability that a node recovers in a unit time step) starting from a single random infected node and averaging over 10000 independent runs.",

The full line is the probability of becoming infected in the largest connected cluster after immunizing or removing a fraction q of edges, according to the highbetweenness immunization strategy. The dashed line corresponds to our improved immunization strategy. Thus, the green (light gray) area represents the improvement. For the most practical case of a small number of immunized flights, the improved immunization strategy is significantly more efficient, while for large q the two strategies have nearly similar effects. Figure 2(b) shows the probability that a student becomes infected as a function of the percentage of suppressed contacts, and Fig. 2(c) shows the dependency of the probability that a router becomes infected on the percentage of controlled connections. Qualitatively, in all cases a similar improvement is observed for improved immunization. For the airline network, the average improvement is about 15% for immunization fractions less than 20%, while the maximal improvement is about 55% for q \u2248 11.9%. For the school network an average improvement of about 7% for immunization fractions less than 20% is obtained with a maximal improvement of 45% for q \u2248 9.4%. In the case of the internet the average improvement is 15% for fewer than 20% controlled connections and the maximal improvement is 24% for q \u2248 8%. Note that the simulations are for a highly contagious illness or virus. Results for less contagious ones are shown for the airline network in Fig. 4 . Not only is the probability for a single person to become infected of interest, but also the maximal possible spreading size is crucial. Therefore, we analyze the change of the largest connected cluster of non immunized nodes during the immunization process, a measure of the network's susceptible size. The size of this cluster gives the upper limit of the number of people that could become infected if the disease spreading starts on a node in this cluster. An efficient immunization strategy should keep this number as small as possible in all steps of the immunization process. In the insets of Fig. 2 we show the possible savings of immunization units with our strategy. To reduce the maximal spreading size to a certain value s, our strategy needs significantly fewer units than the betweennessbased strategy . On average the potential savings are 9% (school), 17.9% (airline), and 21.2% (PoP).",

The full line is the fraction of nodes in the largest connected cluster after removing a fraction q of edges, according to the high betweenness immunization strategy and the dashed line corresponds to our improved immunization strategy. Not only is the overall improvement of R about 30% (see inset of Fig. 6(a) ), but also the largest component that can be infected is reduced by up to a factor of 5 compared to high-betweenness immunization for the practical case of a small number of available immunization doses. In the inset, the size dependence of the improvement of edge immunization is shown for the three real networks, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks, and scale-free networks with \u03b3 = 2.5. The improvement is calculated by the relative reduction of the susceptible size. Interestingly, the larger the system, the better the improvement. In Fig. 6(b) we demonstrate the efficiency of our method on a scale-free network with N = 4000 nodes and an exponent \u03b3 = 2.5. Here we immunize the nodes of the network instead of the edges among them. Although, in general, the efficiency of our method is higher in the case of edge immunization, the overall improvement of R, in this case, is about 6%. The size dependence, shown in the inset, is similar to that for edge immunization for both model and real networks. We have also investigated the effect of the density of edges (degree) in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks on the improvement and found that it has no major impact on the efficiency of our strategy. Both betweenness-based and improved immunization can reduce the spreading of diseases significantly. Nevertheless, for practical cases of small fractions of immunized nodes, the improved strategy is significantly more efficient. In the insets the savings of immunization units obtained using our immunization strategy are shown. We compare the number of immunization units required to keep the fraction of affected nodes under a certain value and plot the relative number of saved units vs the maximal size of the spreading, s.

Our method outperforms other immunization strategies for both node and link immunization. We showed this by studying three different performance measures, the average infection probability of SIR model diseases, the susceptible size, and the relative number of saved immunization doses. All of these three measurements indicate that the immunization significantly improves with our strategy for all networks studied. Such improvement could result in the saving of many human lives and resources. For the most important network responsible for global disease spreading, the global airline network, we showed that with our approximated approach the disease spread may be reduced significantly with a relatively small effort.

Both betweenness-based and improved immunization can reduce the spreading of diseases significantly. Nevertheless, for practical cases of small fractions of immunized edges, the improved strategy is significantly more efficient. In the insets the savings of immunization units obtained from our immunization strategy are shown. We compare the number of immunization units required to keep the fraction of affected nodes under a certain value and plot the relative number of saved units vs the maximal size of the spreading, s. The average savings are 17.8%, 9%, and 21.2% for the airline, school, and internet networks, respectively. FIG. 3. (Color online) Illustration of improving the edge immunization strategy.",
