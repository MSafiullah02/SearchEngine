            "text": "Peacekeeping The Charter contains no explicit provisions for peacekeeping operations (PKOs), yet they have the highest profile of all the UN's operations. PKOs are associated with humanitarian intervention though their emergence was primarily a result of the failure of the Charter's collective security system during the Cold War and the absence of a UN Force. The end of the Cold War and the rise of intra-state conflict led to a proliferation of PKOs from the late 1980s and a greater proportion of armed missions. However, notable failures in the early and mid-1990s, such as the missions to Somalia in 1993 and to Rwanda in 1994, account for a drop in PKOs and shorter mandates. In 1992 then Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali presented the 'Agenda for Peace', which laid out four phases to prevent or end conflict: preventative diplomacy; peacemaking with civilian and military means; peacekeeping, in its traditional sense of operations in the field; and post-conflict peace-building, an area seen as comparatively neglected in previous missions. The then Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented a report aimed at conflict prevention in July 2001 emphasizing inter-agency co-operation and long-term strategies to prevent regional instability. There have been 72 peacekeeping operations in total since 1948. The first mission-consisting of unarmed observers-was to monitor the ceasefire during the First Arab-Israeli War.",

            "text": "Recent History In Nov. 2002 the Security Council held Iraq in 'material breach' of disarmament obligations. Weapons inspectors, led by Hans Blix (Sweden), returned to Iraq four years after their last inspections. Amid suspicion that Iraq was failing to comply, the USA, the UK and Spain reserved the right to disarm Iraq without a further Security Council resolution. Other Council members, notably China, France, Germany and Russia, opposed such action. In April 2003 US forces, supported by the UK, brought an end to Saddam Hussein's rule. In June 2004 the UN recognized the transfer of sovereignty to the interim government of Iraq. In 2005 the Council referred cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the first time, asking the court to investigate the situation in Darfur, Sudan. Instability in Sudan saw the establishment of peacekeeping missions in Darfur (2007) , the disputed Abyei region and newly independent South Sudan (both 2011). Other peacekeeping missions established in recent years have included Liberia (2003) , C\u00f4te d' Ivoire (2004) , Haiti (2004) , Timor-Leste (2006) , Democratic Republic of the Congo (2010), Libya (2011 ), Mali (2013 , the Central African Republic (2014 ) and, again, Haiti (2017 . In April 2012 the Security Council established a mission in Syria to monitor the cessation of armed violence and to oversee a UN-League of Arab States six-point peace plan. However, with continuing violence obstructing implementation of the mandate, the mission was ended in Aug. 2012. While UN sanctions have been tightened against North Korea in response to weapons tests carried out by Pyongyang, those against Iran were lifted in Jan. 2016 following implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action limiting Iran's nuclear development activities. In 2015 the UN launched the Sustainable Development Goals agenda, comprising 17 specific targets to be achieved over 15 years, designed as a successor programme to the Millennium Development Goals. In Jan. 2017 Ant\u00f3nio Guterres took office as the UN's Secretary-General. In Nov. that year the UN imposed its strongest sanctions to date on North Korea in response to Pyongyang's continued nuclear testing programme. A month later the UN General Assembly supported a non-binding resolution effectively rejecting the USA's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In Aug. 2018 the UN issued a report on military atrocities against Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority in 2017 that called for the investigation and prosecution of the country's senior generals for genocide.",

However, reform is in the hands of the permanent members and a unanimous agreement has proved elusive. In Sept. 2004 Brazil, Germany, India and Japan (the G4) launched a joint bid for permanent membership, along with a seat for an African state. In March 2005 then Secretary-General Annan proposed either six new permanent members and three new non-permanent members or the election of a new type of member, eight of which would be elected for a four-year period.

It consisted of the five permanent members of the Security Council. The task of decolonization was completed in 1994, when the Security Council terminated the Trusteeship Agreement for the last of the original UN Trusteeships (Palau), administered by the USA. All Trust Territories attained self-government or independence either as separate States or by joining neighbouring independent countries. The Council formally suspended operations on 1 Nov. 1994 following Palau's independence.

However, in a depressing appraisal at the end of the year he warned that 'unfortunately, in fundamental ways, the world has gone in reverse. . . conflicts have deepened and new dangers have emerged'. Alluding to the crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, he said that global anxieties about nuclear weapons were the highest since the Cold War, while adding that climate change was accelerating, inequalities were growing and that there had been horrific violations of human rights. He concluded: 'As we begin 2018, I call for unity. . . We can settle conflicts, overcome hatred and defend shared values. But we can only do that together.'",

Crucial to this status is the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the expulsion from or forcible return of refugees to a country where they may have reason to fear persecution. UNHCR pursues its objectives in the field of protection by encouraging the conclusion of intergovernmental legal instruments in favour of refugees, by supervising the implementation of their provisions and by encouraging governments to adopt legislation and administrative procedures for the benefit of refugees.

She approved the first rise that month in borrowing costs in the USA since 2006 as necessary, but warned that higher interest rates, economic slowdown in China and depressed commodity markets could undermine the already tepid and vulnerable global recovery. Earlier, in Nov. that year, she heralded the inclusion of China's yuan in the basket of currencies that comprise the IMF's lending reserves.",

She said that, measured by GDP, nearly 75% of the world was experiencing an upswing, reflecting a cyclical pick-up in the advanced economies, especially in Europe and Japan, strong markets in China and India, and a brighter outlook in other emerging and developing economies. Nevertheless, she said that persistent low growth since the global financial crisis had exposed long-standing inabilities to adapt to technological change and global integration. Also, there remained threats from high levels of debt in many countries, excessive risk-taking in financial markets and corruption. In Dec. Lagarde maintained that the UK referendum decision in June 2016 to leave the European Union was already having a negative impact and that the UK's weaker growth in 2017 was in contrast to accelerating activity in the rest of the world.",

The High Commissioner is nominated by the Secretary-General for a four-year term, renewable once. The principal co-ordinating human rights organ of the UN was until mid-2006 the 53-member Commission on Human Rights, set up by ECOSOC in 1946. On 15 March 2006 the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to abolish the Commission after it was criticized for having member countries with poor human rights records. A 47-member Human Rights Council was established as its successor and held its first session in June 2006. In June 2018 the USA withdrew from the Council, accusing the organization of political bias.

UNAIDS brings together the HIV/AIDS responses of 11 co-sponsor UN agencies, providing an overall framework for action and ensuring better co-ordination between its members.The co-sponsor agencies are: International Labour Organization (ILO), Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank, World Food Programme (WFP) and World Health Organization (WHO).

The second amendment took effect on 1 April 1978, and established a new code of conduct for exchange arrangements in the wake of the collapse of the par value system. The third amendment came into force on 11 Nov. 1992; it allowed for the suspension of voting and related rights of any member that failed to settle its outstanding obligations to the IMF. The fourth Amendment, in force from 10 Aug. 2009, provided for a special one-time allocation of SDRs. A fifth amendment, effective 18 Feb. 2011, expanded the Fund's investment authority.

Verification is also applied to chemical industry facilities which produce, process or consume dual-use chemicals listed in the convention.The OPCW also co-ordinates assistance to any State Party that falls victim of chemical warfare as it fosters international co-operation in the peaceful application of chemistry.By Jan. 2019 a total of 193 countries and territories were States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Convention recognizes the human rights of disabled people who have physical, mental and/or sensory long-term impairments that may affect their full participation in society. Article 1 lays out the convention's aim 'to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity'. Member states are obliged to ensure the equality and non-discrimination, health, education and employment of disabled people.

Specific attention is paid to Africa, where desertification is most prevalent. The ten-year strategy covering 2008-18 focuses on improving living conditions of affected parties, improving the condition of affected ecosystems and mobilizing resources to build relationships between national and international participants.The UNCCD encourages co-operation between nations and with international non-governmental organizations. The body also works closely with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In March 2014 Canada became the first member state to withdraw from the convention, having announced its intention to do so a year earlier with then Prime Minister Stephen Harper claiming that it had become too bureaucratic.

            "text": "The Convention was produced at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development with the stated aim of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to 'a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human induced) interference with the climate system'. Signatories agreed to take account of climate change in their domestic policy and to develop national programmes that would slow its progress. However, no mandatory targets were established for the reduction of emissions so the treaty remained legally non-binding. Instead it operates as a 'framework' document, with provisions for regular updates and amendments. By Jan. 2019, 196 states and territories plus the European Union had signed and ratified the Convention.The first of these additions was the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. Under the protocol, 37 developed countries were committed to reducing their collective emissions of six greenhouse gases to at least 5% below 1990 levels. These targets were scheduled to be met in the period 2008-12. By 2012 results were mixed. The EU had reduced emissions by 21\u20220% and Russia by 50\u20223%, while the USA's had risen by 2\u20227%, Canada's by 42\u20222%, New Zealand's by 111\u20224% and Turkey's by 163\u20223%. In Dec. 2011 Canada announced it would be the first signatory to formally withdraw from the agreement. A second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol began on 1 Jan. 2013. The USA has not ratified the protocol. China and India, also amongst the world's top five producers of emissions, are exempt from the protocol's constraints by virtue of their status as developing countries.The members of the UNFCCC meet on an annual basis. The conference in Indonesia in 2007 led to the creation of the 'Bali Roadmap', which timetables negotiations for a protocol to succeed Kyoto, a process continued at the 2008 conference in Poland. The subsequent Copenhagen Accord of 2009 was not legally binding and failed to set out concrete measures for tackling climate change. The 2011 conference, held in Durban, South Africa, advanced negotiations on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Action Plan and the Canc\u00fan Agreements. At the 18th conference in Doha, Qatar in 2012 plans were laid for the development of a successor protocol by 2015 to be implemented by 2020. The 2014 conference, in Lima, Peru, saw a framework agreement approved by 194 nations for setting national pledges for submission at the conference in Paris, France in 2015. The Paris conference duly concluded a global agreement on countering climate change, although no country-specific goals were set. Follow-up conferences were hosted in Marrakesh, Morocco, in Nov. 2016 , Bonn, Germany, in Nov. 2017 and Katowice, Poland, in Dec. 2018 . A further conference was scheduled to take place in Chile in Nov. 2019. However, in June 2017 President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the USA from the agreement.",
