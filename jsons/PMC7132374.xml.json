Structurally and functionally diverse bioactive compounds have been isolated from prokaryotes, including members of the myxobacteria (e.g., Sorangium) and cyanobacteria (e.g., Nostoc) (Magarvey et al., 2004). Most studies aimed at identifying bioactive compounds from marine bacteria have centered on bacteria of the order Actinomycetales, as well as on bacterial production of exopolysaccharides, with cyanobacteria being considered a eukaryotoic algae (Magarvey et al., 2004, Arena et al., 2006, Arena et al., 2009).",

Pure active compounds extracted from the marine actinomycete Salinispora tropica have shown inhibitory effects in many malignant cell types (Prudhomme et al., 2008). In particular, Salinosporamide A, related to the known proteasome inhibitor omuralide, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of human multiple meyloma (Feling et al., 2003). Salinosporamide A has begun phase I clinical trials as a potent inhibitor of dividing melanoma cells. It possesses the unique ability to inhibit the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome subunit, without affecting any other proteases.",

Salinosporamide A was shown to have inhibitory activity against parasite development in vitro (Plasmodium falciparum) and in vivo (P. yoelii). The exact mode by which salinosporamide A inhibits Plasmodium erythrocytic development is unknown, however, it is likely due to the inhibition of the proteasome complex. It is interesting to note that chloroquine resistant strains are still sensitive to Salinosporamide A. Targeting the proteasome system has a huge therapeutic implication as it can restrain growth and survival of most cell types (Prudhomme et al., 2008). These attributes, taken with the fact that it is already in phase I clinical trials as an antitumor agent, makes it an excellent candidate to test as alternative therapies, such as antibacterial, antiparasitic, antifungal or antiviral agents.",

Many are of economic importance as food, fertilizer, agar, potash, or sources of iodine. The antibacterial activity of an aquatic microalgae was first reported for Chlorella vulgaris (Pratt and Fong, 1940). An early report of the antimicrobial properties of seaweed extracts was published a decade later (Pratt et al., 1951), and several other papers appeared in the next two decades (Burkholder and Sharma, 1969).",

These nucleosides were the basis for the synthesis of Ara-C, the first marine-derived anticancer agent, and the antiviral drug Ara-A (Privat de Garilhe and de Rudder, 1964). Ara-C is currently used in the routine treatment of patients with leukemia and lymphoma. One of its fluorinated derivatives has also been approved for use in patients with pancreatic, breast, bladder, and lung cancer (Sipkema et al., 2005). With respect to the diversity of their secondary metabolites, marine sponges have since been considered a \u201cgold mine,\u201d with more than 15,000 marine products described for sponges, which are responsible for more than 5300 different products, and hundreds of new compounds being discovered every year (Sipkema et al., 2005).",

Their early appearance in evolution has given them a lot of time for the development of an advanced chemical defense system. It is interesting to note that the synthesis of secondary metabolites is regulated, depending on conditions that the sponge experiences. The huge number of different secondary metabolites discovered in marine sponges and the complexity of the compounds and their biosynthetic pathways (and corresponding kilobases of DNA for the programming of their synthesis) can be regarded as an indication of their importance for survival (Sipkema et al., 2005).",

This compounds is also active against RNA viruses: VSV, Sinbis virus, and HIV-1 (Baba et al., 1988). However, this compound is not active against coxsackievirus, poliovirus, and parainfluenza virus. A water-soluble, noncarbohydrate component of fucoidan isolated from F. vesiculosus is able to inhibit HIV RT in vitro at 50 \u03bcg/ml (Moen and Clark, 1993). Preincubation of cell-free virus to 200 \u03bcg/ml causes 100% reduction in the amount of HIV-1 p24 antigen released. Tests show that these effects are not due to the killing of target cells. In fact, fucoidan produced no adverse effects on cell proliferation and protein metabolism. The preincubation of target cells with fucoidan actually protects them from HIV-1 infection (Moen and Clark, 1993). In addition to its antiviral activity, fucoidan possesses low anticoagulation properties (Baba et al., 1988, B\u00e9ress et al., 1993, Moen and Clark, 1993).",

Hayashi et al. (1996) demonstrated Ca-Sp to be a potent antiviral agent against HIV-1 in MT-4 cells. The IC50 value for cytotoxicity of Ca-Sp against MT-4 cells is 2900 \u03bcg/ml. Viral replication is reduced at ED50 values of 11.4 and 2.3 \u03bcg/ml when Ca-Sp is added to cell medium immediately and 3 h prior to infection, respectively. Ca-SP was subsequently found to inhibit replication of several other viruses, including HCMV (in HEL cells), HSV-1 (in HeLa cells), measles (in Vero cells), mumps (in Vero cells), influenza A (in MDCK cells), polio (in Vero cells), and coxsackie virus (in Vero cells), by selectively blocking the penetration of virus into host cells.

Cyanovirin-N is an 11-kDa, 101 amino acid antiviral peptide (NSC 682999; C467H737N133O164S4) (Boyd et al., 1996, Boyd et al., 1997, Gustafson et al., 1997) and is unlike any other protein thus far characterized. Low nanomolar concentrations of CV-N prevent the in vitro replication and cytopathic effects of primate retroviruses, including SIV and diverse laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2 (Bewley et al., 1998, Gustafson et al., 1997). CV-N mediates these antiviral effects through apparently conserved interactions with the viral envelope glycoprotein (Boyd et al., 1996, Boyd et al., 1997). CN-V effectively prevents cell-to-cell fusion and transmission of HIV from infected to uninfected cells. Pretreatment of HIV virions irreversibly neutralizes virus infectivity with no toxicity to host cells. The U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) selected this novel anti-HIV agent for preclinical development as a potential prophylactic viricide (Boyd et al., 1996, Boyd et al., 1997). It was first proposed that cyanovirin inactivates HIV by interacting with the virus\u2019 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120. Mariner et al. (1998) found that CV-N does not block the binding of sCD4-receptor to HIV-1 lysates, nor the attachment of intact HIV-1 virions to several target T-cell lines. They concluded that the virucidal effects of CV-N result from interference with a step(s) in the fusion process subsequent to the initial binding of the virus to target cells.",

            "text": "Avarol is one of the few compounds for which the mechanism by which it inhibits the progression of HIV infection is more or less known (Muller et al., 1985, Muller et al., 1987). In vitro and animal data indicate that avarol combines useful properties of an increased humoral immune response, as IgG and IgM production is significantly increased, and interference with the post-transcriptional processes of viral infection. Avarol inhibits HIV by almost completely blocking the synthesis of the natural UAG suppressor glutamine transfer tRNA (Muller and Schroder, 1991). Synthesis of this tRNA is upregulated after viral infection, and it is important for the synthesis of a viral protease, which is necessary for viral proliferation. Low concentrations of only 0.9 and 0.3 \u03bcM of avarol result in 80% and 50% inhibition of viral release from infected cells, respectively. Uninfected cells are highly resistant to avarol (Muller et al., 1985, Muller et al., 1987, Muller and Schroder, 1991). Sponge metabolites such as avarol, avarone, the avarol derivatives, 6\u2032-hydroxy avarol and 3\u2032-hydroxy avarone, and several phloroglucinol derivatives (Muller et al., 1985, Muller et al., 1987, Muller and Schroder, 1991) have been reported to interact with reverse transcriptase, along with illimaquinone (Loya and Hizi, 1993) which targets the RNase H function of the reverse transcriptase.",

Clathsterol, a novel and active sulfated sterol from the Red Sea sponge Clathria sp., was shown to be active against HIV-1 RT at 10 \u03bcM (Rudi et al., 2001). An HIV-inhibitory cyclic depsipeptide, microspinosamide, was isolated from the marine sponge Sidonops microspinosa (Rashid et al., 2001). Microspinosamide inhibits the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 infection in cell-based in vitro assays with an EC50 value of 0.2 \u03bcg/ml. However, this compound is only cytoprotective over a modest concentration range due to cytotoxic effects towards host cells (IC50 value of approximately 3 \u03bcg/ml) (Rashid et al., 2001). An extensive study was performed on the mechanism of action of polyacetylenetriol, isolated from the marine sponge Petrosia sp. (Loya et al., 2002). Polyacetylenetriol shows selective inhibition of the RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities of retroviral RT (IC50\n = 0.95 \u03bcM), as compared to cellular DNA polymerases (IC50\n = 2.6 \u03bcM). Furthermore, a reversible non-competitive mechanism involving a putative hydrophobic interaction was shown to play a critical role in the inhibition of the HIV-1 RT enzyme. Although polyacetylenetriol lacked sufficient specificity and thus could probably not be used as an anti-HIV agent, it was concluded that structural modifications of the side chains of the lead polyacetylenic molecule might produce new potent and selective anti-AIDS drugs (Loya et al., 2002). A new polycyclic guanidine alkaloid, crambescidin 826, was reported from the marine sponge Monanchora sp. (Chang et al., 2003). Crambescidin 826 inhibits HIV-1 envelope-mediated fusion in vitro (IC50\n = 1\u20133 \u03bcM), thus suggesting that this class of compound might ultimately aid in the rational design of small molecule HIV-1 fusion inhibitors (Chang et al., 2003). A new C22 furanoterpene was isolated from a Madagascan Lendenfeldia sponge and designated dehydrofurodendin, which is active against HIV-1 RT-associated RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase (IC50\n = 3.2\u20135.6 \u03bcM) (Chill et al., 2004).",

Compounds like equisetin and phomasetin are isolated from marine fungi Fusarium heterosporum and a Phoma sp. respectively, and have shown significant HIV-1 integrase inhibition in bioassay-based experiments (IC50\n = 7\u201320 \u03bcM) (Singh et al., 1998). Sansalvamide A, a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from the marine fungus Fusarium sp., was found to inhibit the topoisomerase of the pathogenic poxvirus Molluscum contagiosum (MCV) by preventing topoisomerase catalyzed DNA relaxation, DNA-binding and covalent complex formation (IC50\n = 124 \u03bcM) (Hwang et al., 1999). The isolation and identification of this metabolite is particularly significant, because MCV can cause severe lesions in AIDS patients (Bhadury et al., 2006). A series of novel linear peptides, Halovirs A\u2013E, isolated from the marine fungus Scytidium sp., have shown potent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Rowley et al., 2003). The ED50 values (1-h duration) for Halovirs A, B, C, D, E are 1.1, 3.5, 2.2, 2.0 and 3.1 \u03bcM, respectively. In a standard plaque reduction assay, Halovir A can equally inhibit the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 with an ED50 value of 280 nm. The mode of action is still not clear, however it is presumed that halovirs render HSV non-infectious by possible membrane destabilization (Rowley et al., 2003).",

The marine environment represents approximately half of the global biodiversity and is estimated to contain between 3 and 500 million different species, offering an almost infinite resource for novel compounds (Tziveleka et al., 2003). It has been reported that oceans contain 34 of the 36 global phyla and possess nearly 300,000 described species of plants and animals, which represent only a small percentage of the total number of species that have yet to be discovered (Bhadury et al., 2006, da Silva et al., 2006). Marine microorganisms are known producers of pharmacological and anti-viral agents and may provide unlimited biological resources for the production of therapeutic drugs for the treatment and control of viral diseases in humans, livestock and marine farming species, as well as ever more novel compounds with potential as pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, cosmetics, agrichemicals, and enzymes, all of which have strong potential market value (Table 1) (Bhadury et al., 2006). In addition, ecological pressures, such as competition for space, predation, symbiosis and tide variations, throughout thousand of years, originated the biosynthesis of complex secondary metabolites by these organisms, which in turn, allowed their adaptation to a competitive and hostile environment (da Silva et al., 2006).",

Integration between combinatorial biochemistry and computer-based molecular modeling designs, along with post-genomic technologies, could be used for sustainable production of these metabolites. Already, some of the marine metabolites being tested clinically are being produced either through aquaculture (e.g., compounds like Bryostatin, ET-743), chemical synthesis (compounds like Dolastatin, Ziconotide, Halichondrin B derivatives, etc.) or by fermentation processes (Thiocoraline) (Munro et al., 1999).

Large-scale cultivation of marine fungi using bioreactor technology or other means will also be essential for the steady supply of natural products into the marine-based drug market. Fermentation processes have gained considerable importance in the last few years for commercial production of these metabolites. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) has been used widely for the production of biologically active secondary metabolites from fungi. Combinatorial biosynthesis involving introduction of novel biosynthesis genes into microorganisms will result in the synthesis of the novel metabolites due to the effect of new enzymes on the metabolic pathways (Bhadury et al., 2006).",

However, when considering the numerous undiscovered organisms in the marine environment, along with their unique metabolites, it is plausible that increasing numbers of novel drugs will be discovered that viruses have not yet developed resistance to. It is also important to note that many organisms of different species produce similar classes of compounds, each suited for their unique composition and living environment. The fact that varying derivatives of a common class of compound are being produced by multiple organisms may be a solution. A virus that has developed resistance to a particular drug may not be resistant to other naturally occurring derivatives, which have the potential to possess similar, if not identical, antiviral activities. Should no alternatives be found occurring in nature, the application of biochemical technologies will allow the manipulation of naturally occurring compounds to produce chemical derivatives that are far superior to the original (Bhadury et al., 2006). This will allow the creation of compounds with reduced cytotoxicities and increased specificities.",
