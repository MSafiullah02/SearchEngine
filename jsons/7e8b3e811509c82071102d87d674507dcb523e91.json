The concept and model of innate immune sensing was first proposed by Charles Janeway Jr. who predicted that there must exist a group of innate immune receptors responsible for recognition and sensing of non-self from self, and triggering subsequent adaptive immunity (1) . Later studies confirmed his prediction and more and more innate immune receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been found since then.",

These PRRs recognize and sense a variety of PAMPs from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which range from lipoproteins, carbohydrates, lipopolysaccharide to nucleic acids. PRRs also recognize endogenous damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from host, which is related with both homeostasis and autoimmune diseases. Upon sensing of PAMPs or DAMPs, the PRRs trigger intracellular cell signaling, leading to transcriptional activation and expression of cytokines, chemokines, MHC, and co-stimulatory molecules. Additionally, PRR triggered cell signaling induces several transcription-independent cell processes such as phagocytosis, autophagy, cell death, and inflammasome/cytokine processing, which work together with the transcriptional innate responses (2) .",

Different from non-pathogens, the pathogens including viruses and intracellular bacteria replicate in cells, and nucleic acids RNA or DNA represent the signature of pathogens in particular of viruses which accumulate large amount of nucleic acids during replication in cells. All the nucleic acid detecting PRRs are localized intracellularly. For example, DNA sensing PRRs are endosomal TLR9, cytosolic AIM2, IFI16, and cGAS; RNA sensing PRRs are endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and cytosolic RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, and NOD2. RNA PRRs play more important roles than DNA PRRs in recognition of RNA virus infections and initiation of protective immune responses. RNA viruses exhibit rapid replication kinetics, high mutation rates, and complex evolutionary dynamics, thus RNA viruses pose unique challenges to human and animal health (5) . Most severe disease causing viruses are RNA viruses, such as ebola virus, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), foot-mouth disease virus (FMDV), etc. Therefore, investigation and understanding of RNA PRRs are critical for control of virus infections and protection of host. Following are the description of individual RNA PRR.",

Currently human and mouse have 10 and 12 TLRs, respectively: both human and mouse have TLR1-9; in addition, human has TLR10 whereas mouse has TLR11-13 (6) . All TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins and comprised of Nterminal ectodomain or extracellular domain (ECD), middle transmembrane domain (TM) and C-terminal cytoplasmic Toll/ IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain (Supporting Information Fig. 1 ). The ECD contains 20-26 leucine rich repeats (LRR) motifs, which are juxtaposed into a horseshoe-shaped solenoid or a ring-like structure. The a-helix of each LRR is located on the convex surface of solenoid structure, and b-sheet of each LRR assembles and forms into the concave surface of the solenoid structure. Different from other LRR containing proteins, TLRs bind their ligands including agonists on the lateral convex surface instead of concave surface (7) . The formation of M-shaped dimer or multimer is needed for all TLR activation, so that the C-terminal regions of the two TLR ECDs are brought into proximity. It in turn causes the multimerization of cytoplasmic TIR domains, which will recruit downstream adaptors TRIF or MyD88 through homotypic interaction, further forming signaling complex called signalosome and activating downstream transcription factors: one is NF-jB that induces proinflammtory cytokines, another is interferon regulatory factor (IRF) that induces anti-viral type I Interferon (IFN) (6) .",

The crystal structure of TLR3 ECD was the first resolved one among TLR proteins, existing as a monomer of solenoid structure. Upon binding to dsRNA, TLR3 forms a dimer with the backbone phosphates and sugars of dsRNA binding to the lateral positive charged regions of N-and C-terminal ECD (10) . The downstream adaptor TRIF is recruited by activated TLR3 through homotypic interaction, which further forms TRIF signaling complex involving other signaling components, such as TRAF6, TRAF3, TBK1, IKKe, and IKK.

TLR7 and TLR8 are very similar in terms of ligand recognition and intracellular signaling. Both are activated by small molecular agonists and GU or U rich single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (Fig. 1 ). Small molecular compounds Resiquimod (R848) and CL097 are agonists for both TLR7 and TLR8; however, Imiquimod (R837) and Loxoribine only for TLR7, and CL075 (3M002) only for TLR8. In addition, TLR7 and TLR8 may also recognize short dsRNA such as siRNA from RNA interference (RNAi), and some miRNA such as miRNA-21 and miRNA-29a secreted by tumor cells (13) . The ECDs of TLR7 and TLR8 both have 26 LRR motifs that are more than those of TLR1-6; additionally there are several insertions including the one between LRR14 and LRR15 called undefined region or Z-loop, therefore, the ECDs are larger and exhibit the ring-like crystal structures (14) . The TLR8 and TLR7 at endosome are proteolytically cleaved along the Z-loop by cathepsins and arginine endopeptidase; nevertheless, the two cleaved fragments are still stuck together by multiple intermolecular interactions, and both are required for receptor's activation (15, 16) . The Z-loop cleavage is necessary for TLR8/7 dimerization which is essential for activation (17) . Newly recent crystal structures showed that there are dual agonist binding sites in both TLR7 and TLR8 dimers (18, 19) : one is located within dimer interfaces which binds small chemical agonists or degrade products of ssRNA agonists; another is located on the concave surface of the TLR horseshoe structures and for binding of ssRNA oligonucleotides. The first sites are enough for small chemical agonist induced TLR7 and TLR8 activation, whereas both sites are necessary for ssRNA induced TLR7 and TLR8 activation. At steady state, TLR7 and TLR8 exist as dimers; upon binding to agonists, the conformation of dimers change such that the cytoplasmic TIR domains multimerize and recruit downstream adaptor MyD88 through homotypic interaction. The signaling complex called Myddosome is formed involving IRAK4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TRAF3 and downstream transcription factors NF-jB and IRF7 are activated to induce proinflammatory cytokines and IFNs, respectively.",

The optimal RNA recognized by RIG-I is the 5 0 ppp-dsRNA, whereas the one MDA5 prefers is long dsRNA (Fig. 1) . The third member LGP2, lacks of N-terminal 2CARDs, has no signaling activity, but is able to regulate RIG-I and MDA5 signaling due to the capability of binding RNA (24, 25) . RIG-I, as the prototypic member of RLRs, has been subjected to extensive research. Currently, there have been intensive investigations and clear understanding of RIG-I activation mechanism: Under steady state, RIG-I CARDs binds to the Hel-2i region of the helicase and is subjected to auto-inhibition (25) . Upon binding of RIG-I C-terminal RD to RNA, the conformation of RIG-I changes so that the RNA further binds to Hel-2i, and in turn the auto-inhibition of 2CARDs is released. Next, through K63-polyubiquitination/polyubiquitin chain binding of the 2CARDs and/or the filament formation by RIG-I RD-helicase along the dsRNA chain, the 2CARDs are tetramerized into stable lock-washer structure. The effective 2CARD tetramer will nucleate downstream adaptor MASV, which aggregates on the mitochondria into prion-like signaling complex (28) . The downstream TRAF3/TBK1/IKKe and TRAF6/IKK further activate transcription factors IRF3 and NF-jB, which drive IFN and proinflammtory cytokine expression, respectively (29) (Fig.  1) .",

Nevertheless, there existed potassium efflux independent non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome formations under conditions of disrupted glycolytic flux or by stimulation of extracellular LPS (33) . Probably, NLRP3 would favor a general sensor of homeostatic disruption such as lysosomal rupture, mitochondria damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ionic imbalance (31) . However, the exact mechanisms of NLRP3 action need to be further investigated and determined. Under steady state, NLRP3 is likely subjected to auto-inhibition; upon activation, NLRP3 binds downstream adaptor ASC and substrate procaspase-1, forming the wheellike structure inflammasome. Next the caspase-1 is activated, processing the pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into active IL-1 and IL-18 (Fig. 1) . NLRP3 recognizes the cytosolic dsRNA/ssRNA of influenza virus and sendai virus, and bacteria mRNA, activating the inflammasome and inducing IL-1 and IL-18 (34-36) ( Table 1) .",

Once activated by RNA, TLR13 recruits adaptor MyD88 to trigger transcription factor NF-jB activation and induce proinflammtory cytokine production (22) . Mouse TLR13 was reported to recognize a conserved CGGAAAGACC motif in Staphylococcus aureus 23S rRNA and E. coli 23S rRNA (41, 42) . Furthermore, TLR13 also recognizes Streptococcus pyogenes (43) . In addition to RLRs RIG-I and MDA5, there exists a group of non-RLR RNA helicases which mediate cytosolic RNA recognition and signaling. These are DDX3, DHX9, DHX33, DDX60, and DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 (30, 44) . DDX3 binds poly I:C or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RNA, associates with RLR-MAVS signaling complex, and enhances IFN response. DHX9 is expressed in mouse spleen dendritic cells and mouse bone marrow dendritic cells, recognizes poly I:C, influenza virus and reovirus RNA, binds with MAVS activating downstream signaling. DHX33 binds poly I:C and reovirus RNA, activates MAVS mediated signaling or NLRP3 mediated inflammasome. DDX60 can be induced by the virus infection, and in the meantime binds the virus RNA, further binds RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, enhancing RLR signaling and downstream IFN response. DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 are expressed in myeloid dendritic cells, in which DDX1 binds poly I:C through helicase domain, whereas DHX36 and DDX21 bind TRIF TIR domain through their HA2-DUF and PRK domain, respectively. The complex enhances IFN response and exhibits inhibitory effect to influenza virus and reovirus infections. The third minor RNA PRR, leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1 (LRRFIP1) was reported to bind both RNA and DNA and be involved in the recognition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Listeria monocytogene, activate b-catenin, which then translocates into nucleus and promotes IRF3 transcription activity and IFN production (45) .",

Likewise, there are interactions between different RNA PRRs and mutual influence of different RNA PRR signaling. Understanding of the enormous complexity of these processes helps provide insights into in vivo innate immune activation. Within the RNA sensing TLRs, synergistic effects were observed between TLR3 and TLR8 in monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs (49, 50) ; In contrast, TLR8 inhibits TLR7 signaling in both human and mice (51, 52) . Between three subfamilies of RNA PRRs, TLR7/ 8 cooperates with NOD2 in DC activation and results in a synergistic release of pro-inflammatory mediators which promote the activation of Th 17 cells (53) . RLRs suppress the gene transcription of IL-12p40 induced by the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR3 and subsequent TLR3 induced Th 1 and Th 17 responses (47) . Furthermore, RLR RIG-I crossinterferes with NOD2 in regulating downstream signaling by direct interaction with each other (54) . The interactions between different PRRs need to be considered in the contexts of distinct species, various cell types, and different agonists used for stimulation.",

            "text": "The understanding of RNA PRR immune biology including the ligand recognitions, cellular localizations, cell signaling pathways, mechanisms of activation, recognized pathogens and the interactions between different RNA PRRs will definitely be helpful to improve the anti-viral immune response. We give some examples here: First, based on the ligand recognitions and activation mechanisms of RNA PRRs, RNA varieties and small-molecular agonists of higher potency can be developed for either direct anti-viral therapy or effective viral vaccine adjuvants. Similarly, elucidation of the RNA PRR triggered cell signaling pathways will potentially lead to the discovery of novel innate immune modulators with higher anti-viral efficacy. Second, for certain virus infections, only the RNA PRRs involved in the viral recognition will likely play an important role in the anti-viral immune response; in this case, knowledge of the virus recognition by RNA PRRs becomes critical. Third, TLR3, 7, 8 are primarily expressed by macrophages and DCs and recognize viral RNA within the endosomal compartment, whereas RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5) and NLRs (NLRP3, NOD2) are ubiquitously expressed and sense viral RNA within the cytoplasm of infected cells (Table 1 ). Therefore, it should be considered how to deliver the RNA PRR agonists to host to maximize the anti-viral immune response, such as delivery routes, with or without transfection etc. Fourth, as seen in Table 1 , TLRs have general positive cross-talks with NLRs, whereas RLRs have negative cross-talks with TLRs and NLRs. Even though information is incomplete, this knowledge of crosstalks between different RNA PRRs will provide a rationale to develop appropriate combinations of various agonists/ modulators to control viruses which are simultaneously recognized in vivo by several RNA PRRs. With the information becoming complete, and additional knowledge on how the RNA PRR signaling influences downstream adaptive immune response, more and more effective therapeutics or vaccine adjuvants to control virus infections will be on the horizon.",
