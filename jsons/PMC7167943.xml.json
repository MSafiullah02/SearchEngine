Only sparse data, however, are available on the association between high MBL levels and respiratory symptoms, mainly based on studies about asthma in older children and adults (14, 22, 23, 24). We therefore further analysed the role of high cord blood MBL levels using stratification for parental asthma. We found that in infants of parents without asthma, MBL levels in the high tertile were not associated with an increased risk of respiratory symptoms (IRR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.81\u20131.53; p = 0.49 for total respiratory symptoms; IRR = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.88\u20132.82; p = 0.13 for severe respiratory symptoms). In contrast, in infants of asthmatic parents (mother and/or father), MBL levels in the high tertile were significantly associated with an increased risk (IRR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.30\u20134.03; p = 0.004 for total respiratory symptoms; IRR = 3.64; 95% CI: 1.47\u20139.02; p = 0.005 for severe respiratory symptoms). Thus, the association between cord blood MBL levels in the high tertile and subsequent respiratory symptoms was significantly modified by the presence of parental asthma (p value for interaction 0.013 for severe respiratory symptoms, Fig. 3). Similar findings were obtained for stratification by maternal or paternal asthmatic disease. No effect modification was found for paternal atopy as assessed by questionnaire or maternal atopy as assessed by skin prick test for six common respiratory allergens.",

Sensitivity analysis focussing on infants with very low MBL levels [<100 ng/ml (18, 20)] confirmed these results. Currently available evidence concerning the role of MBL deficiency on respiratory infections in children is inconclusive (19) and arises mainly from hospital\u2010based or case control studies (16, 18, 20). Koch et al.

No obvious pattern between low MBL levels and the type of virus isolated from nasal swabs or age at the first respiratory tract infection was observed in our cohort. Since MBL\u2010mediated opsonization and direct lysis of pathogens have primarily been demonstrated for bacteria (9, 10), it may be argued that MBL deficiency plays a minor role in modulating susceptibility towards common respiratory infections (31) during infancy, which are mainly of viral origin. Furthermore, redundancy within innate immunity such as antibody\u2010mediated activation of the classical pathway of complement may compensate for MBL deficiency (32). Since our study addressed lower respiratory tract symptoms in a healthy population with a low incidence of hospitalizations, we cannot comment on the role of MBL deficiency in predominantly bacterial infections such as pneumonia or otitis media (11). MBL\u2010mediated immunity might indeed be more relevant in the context of invasive bacterial infections (33, 34).",

Subset analysis revealed that high MBL levels were particularly relevant if at least one of the parents suffered from asthma. Notably, infants of parents with asthma did not overall have higher MBL levels than infants of non\u2010asthmatic parents, which would be expected if the rise in MBL was caused primarily by a pro\u2010inflammatory in utero environment. Several authors have reported elevated MBL levels in patients with asthma (14, 22, 23, 24, 35), whereas studies based solely on genotyping MBL deficiency found no association with asthma (17, 36, 37). Recently, a novel intronic single nucleotide polymorphism within the MBL2 gene, associated with high MBL levels, peripheral blood eosinophilia and asthma severity, has been identified (23). Since most studies (14, 22, 23, 24, 35) measured MBL at a time when asthma had already been diagnosed, chronic inflammation could have caused the rise in MBL. In contrast, our results demonstrate that high cord blood MBL levels precede respiratory symptoms in infants of asthmatic parents. Thus, MBL may act as a disease\u2010modifier: when an asthmatic genetic background is present, high MBL levels may be either causative or represent a side\u2010phenomenon of an inflammatory process leading to increased respiratory symptoms. Considering that MBL activates the complement system, representing one of the most potent inflammatory cascades (38), it seems plausible that high MBL levels favour complement\u2010mediated inflammation (13, 39). No effect modification was found for atopy. This is in line with several studies who have failed to show associations between MBL and atopy (17, 37).",

Contrary to previous studies (16, 18, 20, 21), we assessed well\u2010known risk factors for respiratory disease and could therefore obtain carefully adjusted estimates of the impact of MBL cord blood levels. Weekly standardized phone calls to the parents allowed us to prospectively assess respiratory morbidity during infancy in detail. Although we studied unselected healthy infants, participants were likely to be biased towards a predominantly white middle class origin, with a high proportion of asthmatic parents and a low proportion of smoking parents as discussed in detail previously (3). This might have affected the incidence of respiratory symptoms, but is unlikely to have influenced the association between symptoms and MBL.",

The present study was based on MBL serum concentrations and not MBL genotype. Since the effect of MBL is related to circulating functional oligomers (9, 10), this approach seems justified. In addition, MBL genotypes correlate closely with phenotypes (11, 12, 20, 36), and recent publications even categorize genotypes as low\u2010, medium\u2010, or high\u2010producing, thus by phenotype (13, 17, 28).",

            "text": "In conclusion, in this prospective birth cohort study, low cord blood MBL levels were only weakly associated with respiratory symptoms during infancy. In otherwise healthy term infants, environmental and genetic factors other than MBL deficiency may be more relevant for determining susceptibility to common respiratory infections (31), which are mainly of viral origin. In contrast, high cord blood MBL levels were significantly associated with increased respiratory morbidity during the first year of life, especially in offspring of asthmatic parents. The strength of this association was comparable to known risk factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or day\u2010care attendance. Innate immunity mechanisms thus need to be considered as important determinants for pulmonary disease. In addition to the principal function of recognizing microbial pathogens, MBL may modify how an individual reacts to an infectious or allergen challenge (24). Contrary to surfactant proteins A and D, which possess a high structural similarity to MBL (8), the biological role of MBL in bronchoalveolar fluids has received little attention (40). Future studies should therefore address the presence of MBL on airway surfaces and its implications in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as asthma.",
