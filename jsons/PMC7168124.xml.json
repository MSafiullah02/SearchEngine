The cells and prototype viruses were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). The polyclonal antibodies were tested against EV71, PV and CVB3 isolates to examine their utility for detecting clinical isolates in cell culture. The isolates were classified using a neutralization assay with virus\u2010specific antisera, or by examining the capsid region sequences. The EV71 strains were isolated between 1997 and 201039, 40 and the CVB3 strains were isolated between 2011 and 2012 in Japan. The PV1 and PV2 strains were isolated from patients with acute flaccid paralysis (associated with vaccine\u2010derived poliovirus) in the Philippines in 2001 and Nigeria in 2005, respectively.41, 42 Human parechovirus (HPeV), Saffold virus (SAFV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) were used to assess the polyclonal antibodies existing in any cross\u2010reactivity against other picornaviruses.

The VP1 region of CVB345 and PV146 cDNA was amplified by PCR and the fragment was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX\u20103X vector (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The vector was then used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Expression of the GST\u2010CVB3 VP1 and the GST\u2010PV1 VP1 fusion proteins were induced by isopropyl\u2010D\u20101\u2010thiogalactopyranoside. The cell pellets were sonicated and the inclusion bodies containing the fusion protein were collected. The fusion proteins were purified by SDS\u2010PAGE and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits as previously described.44 The antibody against PV1 2C (anti\u2010PV1 2C) was generated as follows: the antibody was raised against peptide 2C within PV1, which comprises 20 amino acids and is well conserved among EV. Anti\u2010PV1 2C was expected to detect many other EV. The following EV protein sequences were extracted from the GenBank database: EV\u2010A: CVA3, AAR38841.1; CVA4, AAR38842.1; CVA6, AAR38844.1; CVA10, AAR38847.1; CVA16, AAA50478.1; and EV71, BAG82821.1; EV\u2010B: CVA9, BAA00518.1; CVB1, AAO84299.1; CVB2, AAD19874.1; CVB3, AFS18536.1; CVB4, CAA29172.1; CVB5, AAF21971.1; Echo6, AAQ730951; Echo9, CAA59341.1; Echo11, CAA56365.1; Echo25, AY302549.1; and Echo30, AAD45119.1; EV\u2010C: PV1, NP_041277.1; PV2, AAA46912.1; and PV3, AAA46914.1. The amino acid sequence of peptide 2C was as follows: CQMVSTVEFIPPMASLEEKG. The sequence showed high homology compared with other EV 2C peptides (EV\u2010A: 95%, EV\u2010B: 80%, EV\u2010C: 100% of homology). This sequence was then submitted to the antibody production service at Sigma\u2010Genosys (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A commercial mouse monoclonal anti\u2010EV antibody (Clone 5\u2010D8/1; Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as the positive control for immunofluorescence assay (IFA), Western blotting (WB) and IHC staining.

The cDNA was then used in the first\u2010round PCR with primers SO222 and SO224. The PCR product was then amplified in a second\u2010round nested PCR using primers AN88 and AN89. The amplified DNA was sequenced using an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corp.). The VP1 nucleotide sequences were obtained from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Bilthoven, The Netherlands) database using the EV Genotyping Tool (Version 1.0) to identify the EV serotypes with the highest sequence homology.49 The nucleotide sequences of three EV isolates were aligned using Sequencher (ver. 4.10.1, Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). All nucleotide sequences analyzed in this study have been submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (Table 1).",

Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays using sera from EV\u2010infected patients revealed that the most reactive peptides were derived from conserved regions at the amino\u2010terminus of VP1.50 VP1 mediates viral attachment to target cells and bears several neutralizing epitopes; however, it also shares epitopes with other EV.

Here, we used paraffin\u2010embedded tissue samples from neonatal mice infected with prototype virus or EV isolates (this was not possible for Echo because the virus does not infect mice). A common problem associated with polyclonal antibodies for IHC in tissue samples (both human and animal) is the high level of background staining due to non\u2010specific binding or specific cross\u2010reactions.54 To solve this, we used powdered\u2010acetone tissue or cultured cell preparations to block non\u2010specific binding; we also purified the IgG fraction in an attempt to reduce non\u2010specific binding.54 These treatments mostly worked well, although higher antibody concentrations were needed in the assays (data not shown).

In addition, CVB and Echo infections have been reported by several countries undertaking surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis; the effective control of these viruses will be important in the post\u2010polio eradication era.69, 70, 71 Some countries have developed new vaccines against EV71 and neonatal mice are a candidate animal model for evaluating vaccine efficacy.72, 73, 74 Neonatal mice have been used for both virus isolation and neutralization studies to identify different EV. Small murine models of picornavirus infection are both convenient and useful for immunological analyses; however, the sensitivity of rodents to picornavirus infection is different from that of humans. Thus, it is necessary to understand differences in sensitivity between human and rodent models when studying the pathogenesis and development of vaccines and anti\u2010viral agents. For instance, the pathogenic mechanism in neonatal mice in this study seems to be different from that in human cases of EV71\u2010mediated severe encephalomyelitis. In addition, in EV71\u2010infected neonatal mice, viral antigens were present in both muscle and the CNS; however, there is no evidence for virus infection of muscle in human cases.23, 33 Thus, we need to carefully evaluate the neonatal mouse and mouse\u2010adapted EV71 models.75 The six in\u2010house polyclonal antibodies described herein are very useful for evaluating the pathological dissimilarities between enterovirus infections in humans and experimental animals. Thus, these data will contribute to future studies of picornavirus infection.",

Although the specificity of the anti\u2010EV antibodies for EV was low and they were not able to distinguish between different EV serotypes, they were specific for the EV genus and did not recognize other genera such as HPeV and SAFV. In addition, it should be noted that the detection of viral antigens in tissue specimens is dependent upon the phase of the infection. Thus, clinicians, virologists and pathologists must collaborate to ensure a definitive diagnosis of picornavirus infection. Also, when tissue samples are available, IHC and PCR and/or ISH should be performed. In conclusion, the present study established a panel of in\u2010house polyclonal antibodies suitable for the pathological diagnosis of picornavirus infections, such as CVA, CVB, Echo and PV. These results will help facilitate future diagnosis and research into the pathogenesis of EV infections.",
