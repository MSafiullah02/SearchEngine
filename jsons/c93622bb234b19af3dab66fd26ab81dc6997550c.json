In immunocompromised patients, this intestinal nematode can disseminate and cause a fulminant fatal illness: hyperinfection syndrome. Oral ivermectin is the principal treatment. Since one of the features of S. stercoralis hyperinfection is the development of an ileus and small bowel obstruction, the drug absorption is impaired and thus a reduced efficacy is noted. No parenteral antihelminthic drug is licensed for human use, but parenteral ivermectin is commonly used in veterinary medicine. We report two cases of S. stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome that were refractory to oral drugs and, as a life saving therapy, were treated with a veterinary formulation of parenteral ivermectin (Ivomec \u00d2 , Merial) after agreement from the French drug administration (AFSSaPS). Design: Case report. Setting: Pneumology and Neurochirurgical Intensive Care Units, University Hospital, Paris, France. Main Outcome Measures: case report. Results: Patient 1 A 44-year-old African man has been hospitalized in August 2006 for a degradation of his condition in neurosarcoidosis with hydrocephalus, associated with Enterococcus faecalis meningitis. He underwent ventriculo-peritoneal shunt and was treated with corticosteroids (prednisone 65 mg/day). His condition worsened on September 2006, with the diagnosis of a disseminated strongyloidiasis with paralytic ileus. He was initially treated with ivermectin (12 mg bid) via the nasogastric tube. Antibiotics were added on day 2 to control the sepsis. On day 5 albendazole (400 mg/day) was added. Subcutaneous ivermectin was then obtained and administered on day 6 (200 lg/kg) in association with ivermectin via nasogastric tube while albendazole was discontinued. The patient's condition improved during the following days. He completed 8 days of Ivomec \u00d2 and 30 days of oral ivermectin. He returned home 2 months later. Patient 2 A 49-year-old African man was hospitalized in November 2006 because of a 30 kg weight loss. He was diagnosed with HIV, meningeal tuberculosis, urinary and pulmonary infections and S. stercoralis hyperinfection treated with oral ivermectin. On 29 January 2007 he was admitted in Pneumology Intensive Care Unit with melena on severe immunodepression. On 6 February he developed a septic shock with ARDS on an important bowel obstruction. Therefore, among other antiinfectious therapies, a veterinary formulation of subcutaneous ivermectin was administered (200 lg/kg/day). The sepsis was controlled, but on 11 February he died of an acute haematological deterioration. Conclusions: As the occurrence of malabsorption is a frequent complication of disseminated strongyloidiasis, a parenteral formulation of ivermectin would be really helpful, especially as the efficacy of the subcutaneous form has been proved in the literature.

Poor adherence could lead to inadequate control of asthma complaints. Monitoring of repeat prescriptions by a pharmacist could offer an opportunity to reach concordance with the patient and improve adherence. The objective of this study is was to improve asthma control by optimizing use of asthma medicines. Design: Retrospective follow up study. All pharmacy dispensing records concerning respiratory medication (R03) from 1st October 2003 to 30th September 2006 were collected. Between 1st October 2005 to 30th September 2006 monitoring of repeat medication was conducted by a pharmacist. Pharmacists discussed asthma complaints and use of asthma medicines with all patients calling for repeat prescriptions. When indicated the pharmacist proposed adjustments of asthma medicines to the GP after this telephone consultation. Setting: Community pharmacy and one GP practice (5 GP's) in Leiden, the Netherlands, serving a community of 6.000 patients. Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported use of short-acting betaagonists (SABA) by intervention patients. Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) of short-acting beta-agonists (SABA), long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

The pharmacist worked as a supplementary prescriber and had remote access to the electronic records of the GP. Patients had diagnoses of diabetes (n = 34), hypertension (HTN; n = 250), ischaemic heart disease (IHD; n = 60), other ischaemic vascular disease (cerebrovascular n = 27; peripheral vascular n = 13), heart failure (HF; n = 12), atrial fibrillation (AF; n = 28), were anticoagulated (warfarin, n = 19) or otherwise identified as potential candidates for primary prevention of CVD (n = 100). Main Outcome Measures: Adherence (%) to 51 criteria based on guideline recommendations on primary and secondary prevention of CVD, treatment of HTN, IHD, HF, AF and warfarin therapy; overall applicability of criteria and quantification of insufficient data; interrater agreement of application of individual MAT-CVD criteria and of the overall tool (Cohen's r) Results: A total of 2473 criteria were applicable and for 131(5%) of these there was insufficient data to apply the standard. The guideline adherence (95% CI) overall was 74 (72-76)%. Highest adherence was to 'primary/secondary prevention of CVD' [80 (77-82)% adherence, n = 11 criteria]. Lowest adherence was to 'treatment of AF' [43 (25-61)% adherence, n = 3 criteria]. Non-adherences were found to at least one criterion in 259 (67%) and to C4 criteria in 49 (13%) patients. Inter-rater agreement was assessed on the application of the tool to all patients by two independent raters. All six sections and the overall tool were found to have inter-rater agreement r [ 0.8 and a percentage agreement [90%. Among the 31 (61%) of 51 individual MAT criteria that were applicable to C10 patients 24 showed r [ 0.8. In two of the remaining seven criteria the base-rate problem 2 was responsible for r \\ 0.8 and when taken into account the number of individual criteria with acceptable inter-rater agreement was 26 (84%).",

The inclusion criteria were: (1) at least one stay lasting more than 24 hours in the hospital in 2006, (2) regular checkups with a GP in the outpatient clinic and (3) medication delivered by the community pharmacy of the outpatient clinic 6 months prior to 6 months after the hospitalization. Setting: Both hospital and outpatient clinic are independent and run their own pharmacy. The hospital pharmacy is implied in drug production and distribution without generalized pharmaceutical care activities, and the community pharmacy delivers Rx or OTC medication for outpatients. Geographic and computer proximity between both entities constitutes an ideal setting for seamless care projects. Main Outcome Measures: (1) To map medical or administrative information between community pharmacy, GP and hospital and (2) to find opportunities to improve pharmaceutical seamless care. Results: Sixteen patients met inclusion criteria (5 women, 11 men, average 53 years, mean visits/patient/year with GP: 3, and with community pharmacist: 49, i.e. 16-time more with pharmacist than GP). We observed that administrative information is computerized on a common database for both hospital and outpatient clinic. In contrast, clinical information is mainly handwritten and difficult to share between hospital and outpatient clinic caregivers. Patient medication database is managed by a community pharmacy software not linked to medical information. However administrative information flows in one direction from the administrative to the community pharmacy database. We identified 2 potential tools easily available to the community pharmacy to improve pharmaceutical seamless care in the center: (1) an alarm through the administrative database connection if a patient is hospitalized to allow pharmacist to contact hospital physician for medication history and (2) an access to patient discharge letter and lab results to improve Rx validation process.",

The highest ratio was obtained with CPOE, due to the very high costs investment (1 quali = 22.47 Euros). Conclusions: The use of a prospective risk analysis allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between the medication process of injectables and the paediatric patient safety and to build a strategy for continuous quality improvement, by selecting the most appropriate evolutions. Based on the results of the pharmacoeconomic analysis, development of clinical pharmacy and CIVAS for some drugs will be discussed with the paediatric department Background and Objective: Studies show that up to 38% of patients starting treatment with antidepressants fill only a single prescription at the pharmacy, apparently not accepting treatment. The aim of this study was to determine characteristics and reasons associated with non-acceptance of SSRI treatment. Design: Retrospective questionnaire study. Patients presenting a GP prescription for a newly started SSRI treatment to a community pharmacy were selected. 'Non-accepters' were defined as those patients filling only a single SSRI prescription, and patients who received at least three prescriptions were defined as 'accepters'. Setting: 37 community pharmacies in The Netherlands. Main Outcome Measures: Characteristics evaluated included sociodemographic (e.g. level of education), disease (e.g. reason for use) and treatment (e.g. type of SSRI) characteristics. 'Non-accepters' were also asked for the reason not filling a second prescription. Results: 57 'non-accepters' and 128 'accepters' were included in the analysis. 'Non-acceptance' was more common among patients with a low level of education (OR 2.6; CI 1. 1-5.9 ) and in patients who reported aspecific symptoms like fatigue, stress and restlessness as the reason for SSRI use (OR 2.7; CI 1. 4-5.5 ). In addition, there was a trend that 'non-acceptance' was more common among patients over 60 years of age (OR 2.5; CI 0. 8-7.9) . Of all 'non-accepters', 29.8% (n = 17) did not start SSRI use, while 70.2% (n = 40) discontinued SSRI use within two weeks. Fear of side effects and the actual occurrence of side effects are main reasons for not accepting SSRI treatment. In addition, a considerable number of 'non-accepters' indicated that they felt an aversion towards medicine use, were feeling better meanwhile or disagreed the GP's diagnosis. Of the 'nonaccepters', 55.0% discontinued treatment without informing the GP. Conclusions: Acceptance of SSRI treatment is a decisive moment in compliance to treatment initiated by GPs, and deserves more attention. GPs and pharmacists should address issues related to the use of SSRIs especially in groups who are at risk for non-acceptance.

It is also useful for the pharmacy ward to improve its relationships with clinical wards and feedback on treatments. Training sessions will shortly be organised to improve the above results. Results: The aim of the VITA (Vienna Transdanubia Aging) Study is the early detection of Alzheimer dementia and the discovery of its risk factors. At basic examination, dementia was diagnosed in 21 out of 606 patients (4%) at an age of 75 years. In 89% of these cases dementia was classified as Alzheimer disease. In addition, a clinically relevant depression was diagnosed in 17% of patients at basic examination, but only 32% of them were treated accordingly. The first re-examination after 2.5 years included those patients, who showed no or only mild signs of cognitive disorders at basic examination. 19% of these patients developed dementia within the period of 2.5 years. The first reexamination also revealed a rapid increase of patients with depression (17% vs. 28%). The incidence for the development of dementia was 11% in patients, who have never suffered from depression. However, in patients with the diagnosis depression at basic examination, the risk for dementia was doubled. We aimed to prove whether there is a statistically significant correlation between long-term medication with selected drugs and the development of depression. Eleven classes of drugs were investigated, including calcium channel blockers, beta-and alpha-blockers, corticoids, statines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, H2-blockers, neuroleptic drugs, benzodiazepines, levodopa and opiates. Medication was documented from those 285 patients Pharm World Sci (2008) 30:649-740 659 (122 male, 163 female) without dementia and depression at basic examination, and without dementia at first re-examination. At first reexamination 86 of them were depressive (26% male, 33% female), and 199 had no depression (control group). For each class of drug, patients were divided into 6 groups according to gender and duration of medication. A statistically significant (P \\ 0.05) correlation was found between the treatment with benzodiazepines (C3 months) as well as beta-blockers (C30 months) and the development of depression in both male and female.",

We present the results for IRMA patients who received a platinum salt (PS) as part of their chemotherapy. Design: Data were retrospectively collected for in and outpatients with cancer presenting over two periods in 2004 (February 1st-15th and October 1st-15th). Setting: 15 anticancer centers in France. Main Outcome Measures: Subgroup analysis of IRMA patients who received PS. Data collected: sex, age, weight, serum creatinine (SCR), type of tumor and anticancer drugs. The prevalence of SCR [ 110 lmol/L was assessed. GFR was estimated with Cockcroft-Gault (CG) [2] and aMDRD [3] formulae. Chi-square test was used to compare the prevalence of RI between patients who received PS and patients who did not. Results: 990 patients were included: mean age 60.2 and weight 66 kg, 525 men. The prevalence of SCR [ 110 lmol/L was 9.5%. GFR \\ 90 mL/min was 63.1% with CG and 55% with aMDRD. The prevalence of RI was significantly higher in patients who received PS as compared to patients who did not receive PS (p = 0.0005). There were 993 prescriptions: 38.1% carboplatin, 31.5% cisplatin and 30.4% oxaliplatin. 69.6% of patients received carboplatin or cisplatin, the two drugs of this class needing dosage adjustment and being nephrotoxic. Conclusions: RI is highly frequent in cancer patients receiving PS. Appropriate evaluation of renal function necessitates CG or aMDRD calculation. In addition, two third of those patients with pre-existing RI are at risk for iatrogenic acute renal failure still receive nephrotoxic PS. Consequently, appropriate methods for the nephrotoxicity prevention of those drugs should be used as recommended for cisplatin by the ESCP Special Interest Group on Cancer Care [4] .",

Results: The trained pharmacists that have passed the education process are more facilitated in providing pharmaceutical care that leads to the elderly patients' satisfaction (about 70%). Additionally, the elderly patients obtained significantly more information from their pharmacists that leads to better care and avoidance of nearly half of the drug-related problems (DRPs) for this age. Conclusions: Pharmacist communication skills' training appears to be an effective means of enhancing the communication process in the pharmacy.

Our objective was to assess the role of the pharmacist in prevention of iatrogeny when dispensing drugs, in particular medication errors at high risk for the patient. Design: a 6 month retrospective study, from December 2006 to May 2007 Setting: Pharmacy of Paule de Viguier, Teaching hospital of Toulouse, France Main Outcome Measures: Each error encountered was recorded and analysed. First, we determined the number of errors avoided and the number of errors effective (divided into 2 groups: non avoided and created by pharmacy). Then, we quantified the frequency (1 = once, 2 = from twice to ten times, 3 = more than ten times) and the severity (0 = no risk, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = high) of each error. The multiplication of those two parameters gave us the level of the risk of error for the patient (0 = no risk, 1 to 3 = weak risk, 4 and 6 = moderate risk, 9 = high risk). Finally, for each type of error we noted the actors. Results: We made 6543 dispensations during the period of the study. We recorded 125 errors (1.9%): 92 (14 for 1000 dispensations) were avoided by the evaluation of the pharmacist, 8 were not avoided (1 for 1000 dispensations) and 25 were created (4 for 1000 dispensations). Among the avoided errors, 36 (5.5 for 1000) were at high risk (9), 26 (4 for 1000) at moderate risk (6 or 4), 30 (4.5 for 1000) at weak risk (2 or 3). The actor of 87 of them was the prescriber (mainly lack of information on the prescription like no dosage). Among the 33 effective errors, 24 (3.7 for 1000) were at moderate risk (6 or 4), 5 (0.7 for 1000) at weak risk (1 to 3), 4 (0.6 for 1000) had no risk (0). The actor of 31 of them was the pharmacy. Conclusions: The errors for the activity ''retrocession'' are not numerous. The majority of them are stopped by the evaluation of the pharmacist, in particular those at high risk for the patient. We implemented curative and preventive measures to decrease the number of errors made both by prescribers and pharmacy. Background and Objective: Despite improved treatments and guidelines, asthma control remains suboptimal. In a recent observational study, we described the Asthma Control Test \u00d2 (ACT) as an easy tool to measure asthma control of patients presenting at community pharmacies (1) . The present randomised controlled trial was set up to study the hypothesis that a pharmacist intervention, focused on optimal use of asthma medication and tailor-made to the patient's current asthma control, would result in improved asthma control in adult patients. Design: A 6-month randomised controlled trial in 201 asthma patients: 94 patients in the control group (C) and 107 patients in the intervention group (I). Patients in the control group received usual care. Patients in the intervention group received a protocol defined pharmacist intervention, mainly focusing on inhaler technique and adherence to controller medication. Setting: 66 randomly selected community pharmacies in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was the level of asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Test \u00d2 . Secondary outcomes included rescue medication use, night-time awakenings due to asthma, patients' peak expiratory flow, inhalation technique, adherence to controller medication, quality of life, knowledge on asthma and smoking behaviour. Results: Mean ACT scores did not change from baseline for both study groups (ACT at baseline for C: 19.3, I: 19.7 -ACT at 6 months for C: 19.7, I: 20.3). However, a predefined subgroup analysis of patients having insufficiently controlled asthma at baseline showed that the intervention significantly increased ACT scores during the course of the study compared with usual care (p = 0.019). The intervention also significantly reduced reliever medication use (p = 0.012) and the frequency of night-time awakenings due to asthma (p = 0.044). Inhalation technique (p = 0.004) and adherence to controller medication (p = 0.016) were significantly better in the intervention group. These findings suggest that the more effective use of asthma medication is responsible for the improvements in symptom control.",

Design: Two study nurses especially instructed about typical symptoms of ADRs identify and document these cases prospectively in cooperation with doctors on selected internal wards for a period of three months. These cases are evaluated by a clinical pharmacist by means of a computer tool and data-base specialised on detecting causality and severity of ADRs. Results and outcomes form the basis for structured feedback to doctors. Setting: University Teaching Hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Quantity and quality of ADRs connected with hospital admission. Results: During the first six weeks, 958 patients were screened. Sixty three ADRs (41 female) were identified (6.6% of admissions). More than 50% of ADRs occurred in patients more than 75 years old. Reasons: Polypharmacy (mean number of drugs on admission 8.5) and reduced renal function (mean creatinine clearance 48.6 ml/min). Diuretics, oral anticoagulants, NSAIDs, digoxin and antibiotics were most frequently associated with drug-related problems. Water-electrolyte imbalance, overantigoagulation with or without bleeding, gastrointestinal problems and bradycardia are some of the most common problems. Results concerning the severity of ADRs will be available in September 2007. Conclusions: ADRs are frequent in Austria. Incidences are comparable to numbers given in the literature. Mainly older patients are affected. The impact on clinical practice is yet unknown. Background and Objective: Adherence to cardiovascular treatment, particularly in the first year, is low and can result in serious complications. Depression is associated with a 3 fold increased risk of nonadherence with medical treatment. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether illness and treatment perceptions were associated to depressive symptoms in patients starting treatment for cardiovascular diseases. Design: Cross-sectional study with mailed questionnaire. Setting: Patients, who were dispensed at least a first prescription for a cardiovascular disease (anti-thrombotics excluded), were selected from 5 pharmacies in the Netherlands. Main Outcome Measures: The questionnaire comprised the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Brief (IPQ-B), Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Descriptive statistics and associations between depressive symptoms and the other study variables were assessed by bivariate correlations. Results: Sixty two (37.1%) of 167 eligible patients returned our questionnaire. The mean age was 62.9 yr \u00b1 11.9 (range 40-90) and 51.6% was female. Patients reported to have hypertension (51.6%), cardiac arrhythmia (21.0%) and hypercholestereamia (38.7%).

Background and Objective: The task of assisting patients in selfmedication practice is an important component of pharmaceutical care in Spain. In order to provide appropriate self-medication counselling pharmacist should be able to distinguish between a minor ailment and one that it is not, and should, consequently, refer patients as necessary to GPs. Nevertheless, there are no criteria for referral to GP in Spain. The objectives were:(1)To identify the most relevant minor ailments, agreeing on the specific criteria for referral to the GP.(2)To select the non-prescription drugs, with evidence of safety and effectiveness, for the treatment of the identified minor ailments Design: Qualitative study with an expert panel which was made up of 2 primary care physician from SEMFYC and six community pharmacists (two members of SEFAC and four members of GIAF-UGR). The expert panel held two meetings, of five hours each. It was established which minor ailments were considered most relevant within the framework of community pharmacy in Spain. Subsequently, the expert panel, reach an agreement on the general content that should be included in the protocols for the management of each selected minor ailment. Finally, a working team composed of 4 GPs and three community pharmacists prepared the protocols, which were compiled into a guide for self-medication counselling. Setting: University of Granada, Spain during 2007. Main Outcome Measures: Identified minor ailments, content of the protocols for each minor ailment, non prescription drugs selected. Results: It was selected 27 minor ailments, allocated as follows; respiratory (rhinitis, cough, cold, flu), pain (period pains, sore throat, headache, backache, toothache), gastrointestinal (heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, hemorrhoids), skin and mucous membrane (aphthae, acne vulgaris, cutaneous wounds, burns, stings, urticaria, herpes labialis, eczema lesions) and others (vaginitis, varicose veins, fever, conjunctivitis, insomnia).",

Drug related problems (DRP) were identified by medication review and discussed with the physicians. From January to June 2005 all pharmaceutical interventions (PI) from pharmacists (2 FTE) were recorded (paper based) and classified according to DRP (with the PI-Doc \u00d2 -System, which was modified to comply the requirements for hospital use1), intervention type, outcome and clinical relevance. The PIs were documented and evaluated with an Access \u00d2 database. Design: Retrospective study of PIs in surgical patients, identification of DRP by medication review. Setting: Departments of Neurosurgery, Accident Surgery and General/Abdominal Surgery (70, 73 and 71 beds, respectively), university hospital. Main Outcome Measures: DRP, intervention type, outcome, clinical relevance, drugs and admission diagnoses being at risk for DRPs. Results: Within six month 3679 patients were admitted. DRPs were identified in 17% (n = 610) of the patients. Patients with DRPs were older (mean = 67 y SD \u00b1 14 vs. 56 y SD \u00b1 19) and had an increased length of stay (mean = 24 d SD \u00b1 18 vs. 10 d SD \u00b1 9). 970 PIs were made. The acceptance by the physicians was 95.8%. 175 PIs were classified to the outcome subcategory patient safety and clinical relevance was estimated as major (n = 6) or moderate (n = 169) by pharmacists.",

            "text": "Design: Studies to be included are identified by searching electronic databases. Due to limited relevance of older studies, the scope is limited to studies published between 1996 and 2006. Mainly three techniques can be used to conduct an economic evaluation: costeffectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis and cost-benefit analysis. (2) All studies are reviewed regarding results and methodological quality. Nineteen out of 312 studies met our eligible criteria. Setting: Clinical pharmacy services provided in a hospital setting. Main Outcome Measures: Results were analyzed in terms of number of preventable adverse drug events (ADE), length of stay (LOS) and financial savings. Methodological quality was assessed with respect to perspective, scope and measurement of costs and consequences, sources of data on costs and consequences, and application of an incremental analysis. Results: a) Nearly all studies conclude a financial benefit based on direct cost saving and estimated cost avoidance as a measure of prevented ADE or shortened LOS. b) Methodologically there are a number of shortcomings: e.g. not including the wage of the personnel, lack of control groups, use of expert panels to estimate savings and costs, possible selection bias, no valorization of health effects. c) A methodology for conducting a prospective economic evaluation of an observational study is proposed. Conclusions: It is not obvious to calculate the net savings of a clinical pharmacy program or to compare different programs because there are no common guidelines for this type of assessment. The ideal protocol is hard to achieve, so best practice will be more realistic. Addition of direct cost saving, labor cost and economic value of prevented ADE and shorter LOS results in a lucrative service. These savings are higher for specific inverventions (like preventing ADE, switch therapy) or disciplines (e.g. intensive care unit versus geriatrics Background and Objective: The contribution of pharmacists to the delivery of public health in Scotland is recognised in national pol-icy1,2.

Research has since been carried out, using focus group and questionnaire methodology, to investigate the views of practising community pharmacists. Background and Objective: In Spain, off-label drug utilization (nonapproved indications, patient population, doses, administration route, association), must be derived to compassionate use, which requires a prior National Health Authorities (NHA) approval and a monitoring plan and follow up information provided to them. Request to NHA includes circumstances of case and patient protection measures, including: physician assessment, informed consent and institutional clearance. The objective of this study is to analyse the strength of recommendation, strength of evidence and clinical efficacy of drugs prescribed outside the terms of product licence (off-label) in paediatric patients of our hospital. Design: Literature review to evaluate the evidence level: Micromedex Healthcare Series, Cochrane Library, Pub-Med, Embase, expert opinion or consensus. Sample: 100% off-label drugs used in at least 2 paediatric patients (prior Spanish NHA treatment approval required for every patient). 10 years, retrospective observational study (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) . Setting: Paediatric hospital (300 beds) and Pharmacy Department (1 pharmacist) in a large general teaching hospital (1450 beds, 15 pharmacists). Main Outcome Measures: Categorisation of evidence-based medicine according to Thomson ratings of recommendation (class I-III), evidence (category A-C) and efficacy (class I-III). Results: 191 paediatric patients (3% total patients: adults and paediatrics) used 85 off-label drugs (27% total drugs: adults and paediatrics). Out of this 85 off-label drugs, 48% (41/85) only approved for adults, 35% (30/85) outside of license in terms of indication for adults and paediatric patients and 17% (14/85) both causes. 26 off-label drugs for 29 indications were used in at least 2 paediatric patients: 17% anti-infective agents, 14% haematopoietic growth factors, 14% cytokines, 10% hormone therapy, 7% antiarrhythmics, 38% other 9 therapeutic groups. The categorisation according to evidence-based medicine was: a) strength of recommendation class: 3% I, 24% IIa; 52% IIb, 7% III and 14% indeterminant; b) strength of evidence category: 7% A, 55% B, 28% C and 10% no evidence; c) clinical efficacy class: 2% I, 65% IIa, 21% IIb and 7% indeterminant. Conclusions: A higher proportion of off-label prescriptions is observed among paediatric patients, most of them related to nonapproved indications in this population. There is a broad range of therapeutic groups involved. The evidence of most off-label therapies are based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with conflicting conclusions, small numbers of patients or significant methodological flaws or nonrandomized studies and, although the weight of evidence favors efficacy of the treatment for a specific indication, the therapy may be useful and indicated in some, but not most, cases. Keywords: Medicine-based evidence, Off-label, Paediatrics Background and Objective: There is an increasing demand towards the involvement of the community pharmacists in health promotion. It has been reported that community pharmacists have a successful role in providing services, which help to improve and promote health with regard to smoking cessation, coronary heart disease, skin cancer prevention, drug misuse, sexual health, immunization, mental health, diabetes, nutrition and physical activity [1] . The aims of this study were to describe the current practice of community pharmacists with regard to their provision of health promotion activities, identify their willingness to participate in health promotion and identify the barriers that may limit their participation. Design: A descriptive cross sectional study, which included 186 community pharmacies that selected via stratified and systematic random sampling. Data were collected via face-to-face structured interview of the respondents using a pre-tested questionnaire.",

Background and Objective: Current treatment options for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are limited and there is a need to identify novel and effective therapies. Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinasa inhibitor, which has shown activity in cytokinerefractory metastatic RCC patients. This agent inhibits vascular endothelial grown factor receptor and platelet derived growth factor receptor. The purpose of this study is to analyse the efficacy and safety profile of this agent in patients with mRCC. Design: Retrospective assessment in seven patients treated with sunitinib as second-line treatment in mRCC. Data were obtained from clinical histories and informatic records from the oncology pharmacy department. Setting: Oncology and Pharmacy Department. La Paz University Hospital. Madrid. Spain. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of clinical response and adverse events. Results: Seven patients were evaluated (4 men, 3 women), median age was 57 (41-77). Six of them presented bone, lung, brain or liver metastases, all patients were treated with vinblastine and IFN-alpha as first-line therapy. Patients received sunitinib at a starting dose of 50 mg per day in repeated 6-week cycles for 4 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment. They started therapy with sunitinib because of progressive disease in 3 patients and adverse events in 4 patients on previous therapy. Sunitinib was discontinued in four of them, causes were: adverse events (1 patient), volunteered dropout (1 patient) and progressive disease (2 patients). The median progression-free survival was 6.2 months. The median number cycles received was six and 3 of the 7 patients are still in treatment at the time of data analysis.",

All the pre-dialysis patients who received rHuEPO were including. In order to evaluate the possible changes in clinical practice, we measured the levels of haemoglobin prior to the publication of evidences (March-May of 2006: group 1) and after the publication of these evidences (March-May of 2007: group 2). We made a descriptive analysis of independent data. Setting: Department of hospital pharmacy. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures were: age, sex, mean Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), mean haemoglobin level, mean haematocrit and type of rHuEPO used. Results: We studied 196 patients (95 in group 1 and 101 in group 2). Patients age ranging between 23 to 96 years (median = 73 years). The proportion of women was 61.2%. Mean GFR for both years located around 25 ml/min and the most frequent stages of renal injury were 4 and 3. The most rHuEPO used was Darbepoetin alfa (71.4% of patients). Mean haemoglobin level for group 1 was 11.25 g/dL (SD = 1.43) and 11.61 g/dL (SD = 1.43) for group 2. Mean haematocrit was 34.98% (SD = 4.53) and 35.9% (SD = 4.42) for group 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusions: Our nephrologist are cautious about of prescribing rHuEPO, not only after the publication of the new scientific evidences on this subject, but before this too. It 0 s worth questioning if clinical practice in ours hospital is different from the published evidences. Background and Objective: Tacrolimus (TAC)-based immunosuppression is effective in adult renal transplant patients with acute or chronic rejection or cyclosporin (CYA)-related toxicity. The conversion from CYA to TAC resulted in improved cardiovascular risk profile and increased prevalence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM)compared with treatment with CYA. The aim of this study was to review clinical documents for renal transplant patients and assess patients' outcomes. Design: A retrospective review of clinical data. Excluded from the study were patients converted to TAC less than 3 months posttransplantation.",

The conversion had no added benefit on renal function in patients with stable renal function taking CYA more than 12 months post transplantation. The reported incidence of PTDM was found to be low (2%). Background and Objective: Most of the cancer patients suffer from severe pain especially during the terminal phase of the disease. It is essential to monitor these patients to achieve adequate and successive pain management, not just because of the importance of the effects, side effects and overdose problems; but also to improve quality of life. The aim of the study was to evaluate oncology pharmacist interventions on pain management. Design: Numeric pain scales was conducted prospectively among the 58 cancer patient who were over 18 years old and were selected randomly. Patients were separated into two groups: 29 of the patients was control group, pharmacist had been effectively included to the rest 29 patient's pain management strategies, which was pharmacist intervention group. All of the patients had been evaluated by numeric pain scales (time 0). The patients who were on pharmacist intervention group were monitored by pharmacist on treatment effectiveness and side effect profile every three days during the study. After one month, numeric scales were repeated (time 1). The interventions that pharmacist done were pain evaluation, suggestion on appropriate pain reliever, dose management, patient education and patient monitoring. Our therapy recommendations were made on the basis of the World Health Organization's analgesic ladder following the results of assessments. Setting: Oncology Outpatient Unit of a university hospital Main Outcome Measures: The demographic and diagnostic information of the patients were collected. The results of the evaluations via numeric pain scales were calculated by using arithmetic mean value. Results: The mean of pain intensity was significantly decreased in pharmacist intervention group when compared with control group (2.35 \u00b1 1.85 vs. 4.04 \u00b1 2.10, p = 0.003) and between time 0 and time 1 (3.68 \u00b1 1.93 vs. 2.35 \u00b1 1.85, p = 0.011). The mean of pain's effect on daily activity was significantly decreased in pharmacist intervention group when compared with control group (3.34 \u00b1 2.79 vs. 6.00 \u00b1 2.57, p = 0.010) and between time 0 and time 1 (5.23 \u00b1 3.01 vs. 3.34 \u00b1 2.79, p = 0.019). The mean of drug effectiveness was significantly increased in pharmacist intervention group when compared with control group (86.30 \u00b1 16.4 vs. 73.52 \u00b1 26.6, p = 0.040) and between time 0 and time 1 (58.45 \u00b1 36.9 vs. 86.30 \u00b1 16.4, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The harmonious working of the pharmacist with the other health care staff working in oncology unit, helped patients to achieve more effective pain management. In this study; pain intensity was decreased, pain interfered less with daily activities was, and the reported effectiveness of drugs was increased in the pharmacist intervention group compared to the control group. All these outcomes show that the clinical pharmacists have an important role in oncology services, especially pain management. Background and Objective: To investigate and compare the frequency and nature of prescrbing errors requiring contact with the prescriber at community pharmacies in Norway, Estonia and Sweden. Design: A protocol, based on a scheme originally presented by Rupp (1), revised and developed by Kennedy (2) and translated and transformed to the Nordic context by Haavik (3), was used in all three settings. In Norway the protocol was self-completed by the pharmacists; in Sweden and Estonia observers (trained students) recorded and classified the interventions. Setting: Norway -9 community pharmacies in southern and western Norway; Estonia -4 community pharmacies in three cities; Sweden -6 community pharmacies in 6 Swedish cities and 6 public pharmacies at 6 hospitals in Sweden. Main Outcome Measures: Prescriptions with errors or ambiguities where the pharmacist decided to contact the prescriber to correct, clarify or complete the information on the prescription. Results: The total numbers of dispensed prescriptions were: Norway 69,315, Estonia 13,221, Sweden 49,657 (community pharmacies) and 36,840 (public pharmacies at hospitals). The proportion of handwritten prescriptions and prescriptions where pharmacists contacted the prescriber was higher in Estonia than the other countries. Administrative problems -reimbursement issues; prescriber data and distribution and licensing issues -were the reason for more than one third (34-43%) of all contacts with the prescribers in all settings. However, the patterns of prescription problems with potential clinical hazards varied -in Estonia and Norway, errors concerning strength, administration form and number of doses were the most common errors and constituted 31 and 24% of the problems. In Sweden, errors concerning the prescribed dosage were the most common reasons. Conclusions: The proportion of problem prescriptions requiring a clarifying contact with the prescriber was higher in Estonia compared to Norway and Sweden. The main reason may be that most prescriptions in Estonia were handwritten. Administrative problems (reimbursement and availability of prescribed products) constituted a similar large portion in the three countries. However, prescription problems with potential clinical consequences for the patients, varied. , presenting with Salmonella bacteremia and neurological deterioration due to cerebral toxoplasmosis was admitted to the intensive care unit. He was immediately intubated. To treat toxoplasmosis, cotrimoxazole was started in a dose of 1600 mg SMX/ 320 mg TMP QD. 6 days later the patient developed leucopenia (absolute wbc count: 1.57 9 109/L, neutrophils: 1.4 9 109/L). Folinic acid 15 mg OD was associated to restore white blood cell count. Neutrophils further dropped to attain its nadir (0.4 9 109/L) on day 8 of cotrimoxazole therapy. Cotrimoxazole was stopped and clindamycin 600 mg TD was used instead. Neutrophil count restored, normalizing on day 2 after stopping cotrimoxazole. This event was attributed to the administration of cotrimoxazole. The time relation between the administration of cotrimoxazole and the onset of neutropenia as well as the normalisation of neutrophils was clear. Other explanations, such as the contribution of concomitant medication (ranitidin, ceftriaxon, ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin, aciclovir, amphotericin B, enoxaparin)could be ruled out. The Naranjo score, which estimates the probability of adverse drug reactions, is 6.",

            "text": "The use of folinic acid as rescue therapy in association with cotrimoxazole is controversial, as it can theoretically antagonise the anti-infective action of cotrimoxazole. Therapeutic failure in AIDS patients, receiving this combination for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, has been reported. Nevertheless, we decided to start folinic acid to further prevent nosocomial infections in this severe immunocompromised host. We don't know whether folinic acid contributed to quick recovery of neutrophil count in our patient. Further studies are necessary to clarify its role as rescue agent during treatment with folic acid antagonists. Conclusions: This case report illustrates that cotrimoxazole, frequently used in opportunistic infections, can be associated with agranulocytosis. This dangerous complication in immunocompromised patients with severe infections must be prevented, although the effectiveness of folinic acid as rescue therapy is still a matter of debate. Background and Objective: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is increasingly used in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, because of its therapeutic benefit and its good safety profile. Cutaneous adverse events are rare and include prurit, rash, alopecia and eczema. In the literature, about 40 cases of eczematous skin reactions have been reported. Most of the cases were treated for a neurological or neuromuscular disease. Erythematous eruptions on hands and feet have been notably reported after high-dose infusion. In most of the cases, the eruption was progressively extending to involve the entire body. When IVIG were readministered, eruptions were more rapid and more intensive. We report an eczematous skin reaction of the palms after IVIG infusion without extensive eruption, in spite of three administrations. Design: Case report. Setting: Neurology ward, University Hospital, Grenoble, France. Main Outcome Measures: A 57-year-old man was treated with IVIG (Tegeline \u00d2 , LFB, France) for an inclusion body myositis. He developed a skin reaction, 8 days after the end of a 5 days IVIG infusion (dose of 0.4 g/kg was given daily for 5 consecutive days). The eruption was a non-pruriginous erythematous maculopapulovesicular rash located on the palms. This reaction occurred 8th day after completing the second therapy and did not extend. The lesions regressed progressively with topical application of fatty ointment. Three days after the third infusion, the same lesions reappeared, and regressed the same way. Results: Clinical Pharmacist with the help of pharmacovigilance experts and Doctor worked collaboratively: because of the chronology of exposure to other treatments, intrinsic imputability and recurrence on reintroduction, we ruled out an adverse drug reaction to any other medication. We decided not to interrupt the infusion. We advised the patient to continue fatty ointment application and to tell the healthcare team if the reaction became more serious. Conclusions: Dermatologic adverse reactions such as eczematous skin reactions are rare and usually mild. There is no reason to limit the use of IVIG in a case like this one, as long as the treatment is effective. However, a narrow clinical and biological follow-up is required. If necessary, this adverse effect can be prevented by antihistamines or even steroids. anticoagulants must be monitored closely by physicians, because this products have a narrow therapeutic index. Numerous interactions with herbs are documented, either increasing or decreasing the anticoagulant effect. Our main objective is to identify this interactions in our surgery and if they are clinically significant. Design: Six months observational study; interviewing patients with their INR alterated about herbs that they were taking at that moment. Literature review. Setting: The anticoagulant oral treatment surgery. Main Outcome Measures: The two oral anticoagulant drugs available in Spain are acenocoumarol and warfarin.",

His permanent medications were insulin, perindopril, omeprazole, atorvastatine, bisoprolol, and acetylsalicylic acid. Clopidogrel (75 mg/d) was prescribed 3 weeks before AA occurence. Clopidogrel is withdrawn and AA therapy is started, consisting in the sequential association of anti-thymocyte globulin therapy (15 mg/kg) and ciclosporin (5 mg/ kg/d) in a filtered-air room. But the severe co-morbidities lead to early stop ciclosporin, then relayed by androgen therapy (norethandrolone). Finally, at 12 weeks from the diagnosis, the evolution ends to a resolution of AA, but with platelet-transfusion dependance.",

To blame clopidogrel is difficult with regard to the other drugs, especially perindopril and omeprazole known to induce bone marrow failures. Four arguments lead to target clopidogrel: (i) the length of treatment by perindopril and omeprazole without complications, (ii) the timing between the onset of AA and the addition of clopidogrel to treatment, (iii) the resolution of AA whereas neither perindopril nor omeprazole were withdrawn, and (iv) the support of the literature.

            "text": "Background and Objective: The use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is expanding. The risk for adverse effects can be minimized by taking some precautions. There are yet no standardized practice guidelines for prevention and management of adverse effects occurring during the infusion, and there is a need for it. The purpose was to conduct a study of their knowledge among the nurse community and to make a review of the best practices. Design: We search in Medline and carried out a questionnaire for nurses. We evaluated knowledge and practices of 14 nurses in Neurology, Pneumology and Haematology units, experienced in intravenous immunoglobulins administration, in order to define their role and the prescribers role in ensuring patients safety during therapy. We used all information and synthesized it in a table. For every type of adverse reaction, we indicated mechanism, frequency, seriousness, risk factors, practical guidelines of management and prevention and actor. The guidelines were reviewed by experts (pharmacist in charge of human derivative products, pharmacovigilance experts and neurologists). Setting: University Hospital, Grenoble, France. Main Outcome Measures: Formalisation of practical guidelines on prevention and management of intravenous immunoglobulin adverse effects, for prescribers and nurses in the local hospital network and possibly other hospitals. Results: Nurses always checked the doses before administration (14/ 14), always prepared the product aseptically (14/14), warmed up the product until it reached room temperature (12/14), but only few recorded the patients tolerability during the infusion (9/14), and very few knew that most adverse events could be minimized first by slowing down the rate of infusion (4/14). All nurses called a doctor as an adverse effect appeared. Conclusions: Nurses must be involved in the management of adverse effects, even if the prescriber remains the one who makes the prevention by evaluating risk factors, co-medications, dosing and frequency of treatment and the one who makes the decision to interrupt the treatment if an adverse effect occurs.

Setting: Pharmacy Outpatient Unit, Agence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Equipements et Produits de Sant\u00e9 (AGEPS) (AP-HP), Paris, France. Main Outcome Measures: The questionnaire consisted of three items: general information about patient and its treatment; patient's knowledge of F before reading the leaflet (uses, precautions, adverse events, storage); patient satisfaction of leaflet (general presentation, language simplicity, information volume, utility). Results: 70 patients answered the questionnaire. The mean age was 47 years (3-88 years). Mean F treatment duration was 17 years (2 months-43 years).",

Language was understandable for 94%, and non understandable for 2%. Information volume was sufficient for 88%, insufficient for 4%, and too large for 4%. Leaflet was useful for 93% of pts. Patients who found the information insufficient suggested the following items: results of clinical trials, management of acute situations due to disease or F, and contacts of qualified centres in case of serious events. Conclusions: Nearly half of the patients were informed about F by their physicians, but information is communicated orally without written support. The majority of patients treated by F knew about precautions, side effects, and storage conditions. However, patients were satisfied of our information leaflet and find it useful. Leaflet appears to be a good tool to communicate information from the pharmacist to the patient when not available in the packaging. Of these 102 recommendations taken into account (63%), within a period of 2 days for most (n = 84), 53 involved the intervention of a pharmacy student, 33 were given only via the computer software, and 16 via a telephone call. Conclusions: Computerisation of prescriptions is an indispensable tool in order to make the pharmaceutical distribution circuit safer. However, its use as a vehicle for pharmaceutical interventions is limited, as shown by this study. It is impossible to analyse a nonresponse of our recommendations: is our advice even red, is it considered as inadequate? A discussion with the clinician (via pharmacy students or on the telephone) allowing a constructive exchange of knowledge, leads to a better transmission of recommendations. Background and Objective: In hospital setting, employees may be exposed to hazardous drugs. Risks and protective measures needed when handling parenteral cytotoxic drugs are well described, whereas information related to drugs like monoclonal antibodies or antivirals are lacking. We developed a standardized method to evaluate drugs potential toxicity and occupational risks taking into account the pharmaceutical forms of the drugs to balance the risks. Design: Development of an algorithm for toxicity evaluation using Material Safety Data Sheet (Risk and Safety phrases), International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) classification and official manufacturers' data.",

Setting: We retrospectively reviewed all prescriptions of IVIG issued from three infectious disease departments (50 beds) in a French 500bed university hospital. Main Outcome Measures: For each IVIG prescription, the following data were collected: patient identification, name of IVIG product, quantity of IVIG issued, date of IVIG release, indication for treatment and level of relevance. These levels are determined as follows. Level 1: indications approved by health authorities or for which comprehensive guidelines have been published (high level of proof). Level 2: relevant indications based on scientific publications. Level 3: off-label indications more difficult to prove on a scientific basis (few or no high quality randomized controlled clinical trials). Results: During the studied period, 25 715 grams of IVIG were administered for a total of 68 patients and 296 prescriptions. 88.9% IVIG used saccharose as a stabilizing agent, other products contain either glucose (10.4%), or maltose (0.8%).

Conclusions: NES are proactively supporting national policy and practice through a process of identifying and meeting the educational needs through direct and self-directed learning for Continuing Professional Development (CPD). The needs of Palliative care patients are seen as an appropriate target group for pharmaceutical care. The evaluation and feedback from the courses, training pack and outcomes from the use of the NAT in practice have been very positive and amendments will be made for further implementation in Scotland. Background and Objective: Pharmacy students represent a broad spectrum of learning preferences and styles. This diversity presents a responsibility for the lecturers and instructors to meet the educational needs of all students. In order to develop appropriate learning approaches the instructors need to know the students learning preferences. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the learning preferences of pharmacy students. Design: The visual, auditory, reading/writing, kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire identifies student's preferences for particular modes of information presentation. The VARK questionnaire is freeware that can be completed online. However, we administered the VARK questionnaire as a hard copy at the end of the 'clinical pharmacy practices' final exam to the fourth-grade pharmacy students. Setting: Marmara University -Faculty of Pharmacy. Main Outcome Measures: The frequency of students' preference for modes of information presentation. Results: We administered the VARK questionnaire to 108 students and 106 (98%) returned the completed questionnaire. Almost half of the students (48.1%) preferred a single mode of information presentation. Among these students, 2% preferred visual (learning from graphs, charts, and flow diagrams), 19.6% preferred auditory (learning from speech), and 29.4% preferred printed words (learning from reading and writing), and 49% preferred using all their senses (kinesthetics: learning from touch, hearing, smell, taste, and sight). The other half (51.9%) preferred multiple modes [2 modes (44.3%), 3 modes (4.8%), or 4 modes (2.8%)] of information presentation. A total of 63 (59.4%) students preferred 'kinesthetic' learning solely or in a multimodal combination. Conclusions: The students represented a variety of learning styles. Student motivation and performance improves when instruction is adapted to student learning preferences and styles; so, it is the responsibility of the instructor to address this diversity of learning styles and develop optimum learning approaches. Escitalopram, fluoxetine and mirtazapine were rarely prescribed. The posology and taking plan were generally respected. However, some improvements in terms of treatment optimization could have been brought. They could have lead to 32 actions of clinical pharmacy within the framework of prospective study: 9 posology optimizations and 23 taking plan optimizations. Nineteen patients (40%) had an adjustment in their antidepressant treatment: nature and dosage. For all the antidepressants, a sufficient duration was respected before increasing the doses. An average number of interactions by prescription were 4.8 but none was clinically significant. Conclusions: Therapeutic strategies corresponded to guidelines recommendations. The Dosage adjustments and duration before increasing the doses respected the indication of antidepressants.",

            "text": "Design: A pharmacist designed the training program and took the initiative and responsibility for training other pharmacists in AAH about clinical pharmacy. The department of Medical Oncology/ Hematology, the hospital administration and the pharmacy department agreed that the pharmacists should have central responsibility for antineoplastic agents and other drugs related problems. Pharmacists for the program were selected from the existing staff. The Healthcare team is consisting of two pharmacists rotating every 2 months. Each pharmacist join 2 teams consisting of a pharmacists, a consultant, a specialist, a resident, a rotating resident, 2 nurses, a dietitian, physiotherapist, social worker and a psychologist. We used to have 3 oncology teams and 1 hematology team. Both pharmacists participate in the medical rounds and morning report 3 days per week. The pharmacists provide clinical pharmacy services including chart review, pharmacy patient profile review, laboratory tests, therapeutic drug monitoring, antibiotics monitoring, interviews with patients and/or relatives. Drug related problems were identified, resulting in interventions. Setting: In patient wards, Al-Amal Hospital, Qatar. Main Outcome Measures: To identify Drug Related Problems, which well result in interventions and to help the medical team and the patients to reach their treatment goals. Patient outcomes were evaluated by follow up with the medical team or by patient interview. We refer patients to the dietitian, physicians, the clinical psychologist as needed. Results: More time is needed to evaluate the clinical pharmacy services provided by the pharmacists as the program was just started. Patient and physicians were satisfied by starting the training program. Conclusions: Hematology/Oncology setting provides an excellent opportunity to involve pharmacists. A. leads to encephalopathy and progressive neurodegeneration in the infant who is not treated. Early diagnosis and dietary management can prevent complications and may allow for normal intellectual development. However, neurologic function may deteriorate rapidly at any age because of acute metabolic decompensation. These severe episodes are caused by catabolism of endogenous protein, which may be provoked by physiological stress (infections, post-surgery). During these crisis, the patient must have immediately intravenous glucose infusion and enteral nutrition free of B.C.A.A. Design: Case report. Setting: Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Charles Nicolle, Rouen. Main Outcome Measures: Case report Results: One patient with classical M.S.U.D. is followed in our establishment since many years. His disease has been diagnosed in neonatal period. A diet free of B.C.A.A. has been instaured. This diet is successful, now this patient is 34 years old and had a normal development except myalgia and hypoesthesy of the left leg. However, when the diet is not well followed or when he's infected, acute episode occurs (on average 3 or 4 times per years). As the crises starts, the patient is sleepy and confused. In order to be able to treat him very quickly, the medical staff decided to set up an emergency protocol, which include an adapted enteral nutrition formulation. The pharmacy is implicated in this protocol to prepare the mixture. The formula includes: M.S.U.D mix, dextrin maltose, oligoelements, ions, lipids (sunflower oil), vitamins and water. The pharmacy must be able to carried out the preparation at any time and the components must be always available. Conclusions: Because M.S.U.D is an unherited disease, published report of treatment are rare and they are no consensus for the treatment of acute decompensation. Since 6 years, this protocol is successful: B.C.A.A. levels decrease between 2 to 4 days after the setting-up and the patient always recovered rapidly. This formula is administrated by nasogastric tube and avoid the use of hemodialysis which is the last solution to remove B.C.A.A. This is an example that a personnal follow-up program (with plan for clinical and metabolic evaluations) during common intercurrent illnesses can have optimal outcomes.

Results: Phosphorous oral solution procedure: composition, stability and the scheme of addition to human milk to ensure the requirements for bone substrate needs in preterm infants to avoid osteopenia of prematurity. Conclusions: Various methods have been tested to decide when additional supplements must be given. Individual adjustment is not possible due to the delay of laboratory results on milk analysis and the fast changes in infants' requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to make a standard adjustment scheme on the dose of the fortifier that needs to be added. Shortly to the pancreaticduodenectomy, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was started (1500 kcal in progress until reaching his energy requirements). In addition to parenteral nutrition, supplementation enteral nutrition was delivered via jejunostomy along four postoperative days. On post day 8, transition to a complete enteral formula was achieved (standard formula, 1 mL = 1 kcal: 2000 kcal/d). On day 12, patient complained of colic pain in upper hemiabdomen.

Design: Mail SD rats weighing between 230 and 270 g were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg of Ketamine and 3 mg/kg of Xylazine. A haparinized 24 G catheter was placed in the left femoral vein. The trachea was intubated and then mechanically ventilated with room air using a volume-controlled rodent ventilator. A left thoracotomy was performed, and the pericardium was opened. For the ischemia-reperfusion experiments, a snare was passed around a left anterior coronary artery territory to induce regional myocardial ischemia. Coronary occlusion was produced by pulling the snare and clamping it with a mosquito hemostat. Reperfusion was produced by releasing the clamp. Setting: Rats were subjected to 25 minutes of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Propofol or intralipid was administrated during 35 minutes starting 5 minutes before the onset of ischemia until 5 minutes after the onset of reperfusion. Main Outcome Measures: The micro-manometer catheter was advanced into the left ventricle via right internal carotid artery and hemodynamic function was checked after 24 hours of reperfusion.

The same applied to 43.5% of the opened capsules. Moreover, the crushing hygiene was problematic: all medications for one resident were crushed together and the crushing device was not cleaned between different residents. Inhalation techniques were inadequate in almost all cases (insufficient inhalation by the resident, coordination problems or expiration in the device). Furthermore, specific administration moments were not taken into account. For example, the administration of alendronate (Fosamax \u00d2 ) was observed in a horizontal position after breakfast, while it should be administered 30 minutes prior to breakfast in a vertical position.

After an experience of implementation of individual drug dispensing (IDD) the objective of the department of pharmacy was to prove the benefit offered by this system in comparing the clinical impact of the intercepted dispensing errors of both dispensing system. Design: Thirty days prospective study. Setting: Orthopaedic surgical care unit; department of pharmacy. Main Outcome Measures: Data related to drug preparation were collected by two pharm D students over a 30 days period and analysed. Identified preparation errors were classified in four groups: discordance between prescription and drug administration, exceeding or missing treatment and, unidentified delivered drugs. Then errors were classified in potential or effective errors. At last, pharmacist and prescriber have quote this errors. Preparation errors were classified according to their clinical impact from 0 (no clinical impact) to 3 (life threatening). Results: 1 631 drugs units were prepared with GDD vs 1 446 with IDD. Eighty effectives errors (4.90%) were observed with GDD and 11 (0.76%) with IDD. Clinical impact were 0 (34%), 1 (36%), 2 (30%) for GDD and 0 (90%), 1 (10%) and 2 (0%) for IDD.

The results provided by this study highlight the role of the pharmacy staff, to reduce the incidence of medication errors and to promote a rational use of medicines. This work was the second step of our quality medication process; the next step will be the development of IDD in several care unit by use and test automated process for preparing doses. For each prescription we collected information about the patient, the prescribed drug, the steps involved in its preparation and its administration. Results: We collected 279 prescriptions (126 different drugs) concerning 77 children (average age: 6 years). Sixty-two percent of medications were oral forms: 49% liquids, 25% tablets, 19% capsules. Thirty-two percent of the tablets were cut; only 30% of those were authorized. Due to the age, 44% of the tablets were crushed to facilitate administration whereas grinding was allowed in only 31% of the cases. Most of the capsules were opened (71%) and 6% fractionated for an adapted dose. Opening of capsules was possible in 92% of the cases. Intravenous drugs represented 29%, the average injection was 71.5% of the vial; in 14%, less than a quarter was given. Conclusions: About 20% of pediatric preparations were inappropriate. The results of this study highlight the need to provide drugs adapted to pediatric care, which is one of the main tasks of the pharmacy. We are thus developing more appropriate pharmaceutical formulations for children, such as oral suspensions. A comparative statement of solubilization rates in liquid of crushed tablets or capsules after opening has to be established. Moreover if a pharmacist is present in the care units, most medication error will be avoided. Background and Objective: The world's population is aging. The elderly have many chronic disorders and consequently use more drugs than any other age group. Safe, effective pharmacotherapy is one of the Results: Fifty patients received antibiotics according to several schemes. Nineteen patients received prophylactic treatments during 3.3 days on average. The employed molecules were mostly part of beta-lactams' family (84.2%) including 87.5% of Co-amoxiclav. The prophylactic treatment seemed to be effective in 73.7% of case because it wasn't followed by other treatment.",

These increases were often physiopathological, related to multivisc\u00e9rales failures or to septic shocks. The antibiotics could be clearly blamed in only one case. Conclusions: In the surgical intensive care unit, antibioprophylaxy is longer than in recommendations. The probabilistic treatments used often associate active molecules on multiple-drugs-resistant bacterias. This can be explained by the gravity of infections, and the increased risk of bacteriologic resistances due to former treatments. Moreover, bacteriological tests are systematically done, so antibiotics can quickly be adapt to the germs' resistances. Background and Objective: Most of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) do not have legal mention for a paediatric use. However these drugs are largely prescribed to children. One disadvantage resides in the absence of liquid form which causes problems for their administration in nasogastric tubes. Indeed, the absence of use recommendations involves many misuses responsible for inefficiency and/or tube obstruction. We tried to evaluate if PPIs can be administered through paediatric nasogastric tubes. Design: To quantify the transit of different PPIs through paediatric nasogastric tubes and to optimise their modes of administration. Setting: Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy and Biotechnics. Faculty of Pharmacy. Main Outcome Measures: We administered four PPIs (Mopral \u00d2 , Ogast \u00d2 , Inexium \u00d2 , Ogastoro \u00d2 ) through nasogastric tubes by respecting their positioning in a child in a 30\u00b0elevation. For each PPI a study plan was drawn up to assess the influence of different variables: the volume of water to dissolve or put in suspension the PPIs (2 or 5 ml), the rinse volume (2.5 or 10 ml), the length (50 or 125 cm) and the diameter (6 or 8 French) of the polyurethane tubes. For every tests (n = 134) we carried out an analysis of each active ingredient at the tube outlet by UV spectrometry. Results: All 6 F tubes were obstructed by PPIs. Through 8 F tubes, we observed a mean recovery of active ingredient of 86% for Ogastoro \u00d2 , 36.9% for Inexium \u00d2 but only 7.1% for Ogast \u00d2 and 3.9% for Mopral \u00d2 . The length of the tubes had no significant influence on the loss of PPI at the outlet of the tube. A water volume of 5 ml instead of 2 ml increased only the final concentration of Inexium \u00d2 (+26%). A rinse volume of 10 ml improved significantly the transit of Mopral \u00d2 , Ogast \u00d2 and Ogastoro \u00d2 (+4.8%, +2.7%, +19.5% respectively). This rinse volume allowed to obtain a 94.5% recovery of lanzoprazole for Ogastoro \u00d2 whatever the water volume employed for its administration. Conclusions: The most satisfactory results were obtained with Ogastoro \u00d2 : an administration volume of 5 ml and a rinse volume of 10 ml allowed a near-complete transit of lanzoprazole. Under these conditions only 45% of Inexium \u00d2 was recovered. It is disadvised using Mopral \u00d2 and Ogast \u00d2 through 8F nasogastric tubes because no condition ensure the transit of an efficient concentration of active ingredient. Keywords: Nasogastric tubes, Proton pump inhibitors, Children Background and Objective: Feeding tube occlusion is a frequent problem. Practices to make the clogging off are very varied and are not the subject of any consensus. No study have assessed the impact of the different products on the inner surface of the tubes. In this context, it seams to be important to evaluate if these products are safe in order to rationalize the practices. Design: To study the inner surface of nasogastric feeding tubes after contact with various products used to unblock them. Setting: Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy and Biotechnics. Faculty of Pharmacy. Main Outcome Measures: we have put in contact 12 F nasogastric tubes made of silicone or polyurethane with the following products: water, 1.4% sodium bicarbonate, orange juice, pineapple juice, cola, papain syrup, pancreatic enzymes. An analysis of the inner surface of the tubes was carried out after 7, 15 and 30 days by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Photos of unexposed tubes were used as negative controls. Photos of tubes exposed to heat, ether or sodium hydroxide were used as positive controls. Results: The analysis by SEM shows that the silicone tubes are not altered by the different products tested. On the other hand, the surface of polyurethane tubes is modified in the presence of 1.4% sodium bicarbonate and pancreatic enzymes. The papain syrup seems to settle on the surface of the tubes without altering it. Water, fruit juices and cola do not modify the biomaterial whatever the exposure time. Conclusions: 1.4% sodium bicarbonate, pancreatic enzymes and even papain syrup should not be used in practice to unblock the feeding tubes. The orange and pineapple juices as well as cola can be recommended because of their harmlessness with biomaterials.

Design: A questionnaire was designed and filled in by asking questions directly to nurses about their administration practices, from February to April 2007. Setting: Altogether, six pediatric units were consulted, corresponding to the units for which the laboratory carries out the most pediatric extemporaneous formulation preparations. Main Outcome Measures: The questionnaire concerned the ten most made up pediatric preparations, which are: amiodarone, warfarine, captopril, propranolol, ursodesoxycholic acid, omeprazole, fludrocortisone, spironolactone, hydrocortisone and calcium carbonate. Items filled in were: hygiene rules, the existence of administration procedures in units, preparation conservation, and practical administration details. Results: In 3 months, 40 questionnaires were filled in. Concerning hygiene rules, nurses wash their hands before every manipulation, 21% wear gloves, 10% wear a mask or a mobcap. No administration procedures were available in units and more than 80% of nurses would like to have one. In every unit, preparations were conserved at room temperature, in a dry place, and 87% in a light-free place.",

The aim of this study is to provide pediatric units with guidelines about good use of extemporaneous formulation pediatric preparations. services compared to a pharmaceutical care model. Items pertaining to pharmacists' communication with the patient and the physician as well as the pharmacists potential to manage drug therapy were assessed. Results: Of the 1000 patients approached, 720 (72%) response rate was achieved. Cronbach's alpha = 0.7084 (expectations) and 0.950 (satisfaction). Females were 367 (51%), married (75%) and 52% had post-secondary education. Some 83% expect accurate dispensing of their medications, 78% expect pharmacists to simplify their medications and 52% expect the pharmacist to spend as much time as possible with them. Expectations were resolved into 3 components: humaneness, friendly attitude and professional competence. Only 51% were satisfied with the professional appearance of the pharmacy, the rest of the items received dissatisfaction rating. Two principal components of satisfaction were identified as humaneness and professional competence. Marital status and level of education were associated with satisfaction scores. Conclusions: Patients' expectations of pharmaceutical care services were high but the satisfaction with current services compared to pharmaceutical care was below average. Professional competence and humaneness were important dimensions of both patient expectations and satisfaction. There is a need to introduce pharmaceutical care. Results: Fourteen criteria were defined. A yes, no or not applicable answer has been given to each criterion according to the guidelines.

Inclusion criteria were: oral and injectable drugs' prescriptions concerning patients who were present in the ward since more than 24 hours. Results: 27 medical records were analyzed. Patient age varied from 51 to 74 years old and the average duration of the hospitalisation from 4.5 to 13 days. Omitted variables were: patient's weight in all cases, prescriber's quality in 93% of cases, prescription's hour in 63% and prescriber's signature in 59.3%. For each patient, all drugs prescribed since the beginning of the hospitalization in the unit was studied i.e. 334 lines of drugs. We have noted the INN was absent in 90% of the cases, pharmaceutical form in 74% and administration route in 57%. Only one prescription had all variables. Thus, the global rate of prescription conformity was 0%. In the 3 wards, nurses write the original prescriptions on a card-index (CI). Then, drugs administrations are written on a temperature chart (TC) and on pharmacy's book (PB) for drugs order. We have compared documents one by one, for each drug. Conformity rates are 60.5% (prescription/CI), 70.4% (CI/ TC) and 0% (CI/PB). The noted differences are multiple(modification of the administration or hour route, increase or dicrease of dosage\u2026). The clinical relevance of non conformity was not studied. Conclusions: From this study, it can be concluded that many prescriptions do not comply to the regulation and many retranscriptions are not identical to original prescriptions. It constitutes of course a potential iatrogenic impact. The development of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) in our hospital should be a corrective measure. The next stage will consist of realizing this study with CPOE and compared the 2 studies.",

Design: Patients treated with antibiotics were included each day, during the analysis of the computerized prescriptions in the pharmacy. Then, a report sheet was indicated in the unit with the prescribers for each patients with pneumonia or exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease. One month prospective study (in April 2007) included all patients hospitalised for pneumonia or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) in a unit of the Pneumology Department and treated with antibiotics. Setting: Pneumology Department -Reims University Hospital. Main Outcome Measures: For each patient the following data were assessed: age, hospitalization duration, diagnosis, severity factors, comorbidities and antibiotic prescriptions were analyzed. Treatments were thought consistent when following the national guidelines [1; 2] . Results: 63 new patients were hospitalized during this month. 44 (70%) were treated with antibiotics: 4 with no pulmonary pathology and 40 with pulmonary infection (19 patients with pneumonia, 4 with ECOPD, 5 with pleurisy, 4 with exacerbation of asthma, 4 with chest secondary infection, 2 with acute respiratory infection, 2 with thoracic pain and 1 with cough).",

            "text": "Then, the study focused on 23 patients: 19 pneumonia and 4 ECOPD (M/F = 13/10, mean age: 61 years old). Hospitalization duration was about 10 days. 18 patients (78%) had at least one co-morbidities factor (the majority: 9 with pulmonary antecedents) and 13 (57%) a severity factor (the majority: 10 with an attack of the vital functions). 12 antibiotic treatments were initiated in the unit and 11 out (9 in emergency department and 2 by general practitioner). All treatments initiated in the unit were consistent with the recommendations and revaluated with the bacterial results (except one treatment) or changed because of bad tolerability. Bacteriological documentation was always researched and the results were significant for 6 patients (26%): 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Proteus mirabilis with Morganella morganii and 1 Haemophilus influenzae. When it was possible, per os relay was realized in the 24 at 48 hours, except for 2 patients (relay in the 3 days). Conclusions: In this survey, the management of pneumonia and ECOPD was globally consistent with the national guidelines. Nevertheless, the bacterial documentation is poor and the antibiotics prescriptions for bronchopulmonary infections are difficult and need using molecules with large spectrum. collaborate with all of the health care professionals and patients and to identify causes of errors. The unique position and possibilities of a pharmacist enable him to follow up the errors, from a fact that he is an expert on medication properties and is basically the last in a row who deals with drugs before their administration to the patients. The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the role of pharmacist in identification and dealing with medication errors in Czech pharmacy. Design: 30 pharmacists identified and recorded all medication errors over a period of six months of pharmaceutical care. Basic characteristic of pharmacists: mean age 35.0 years; mean length of pharmaceutical practice 9.7 years; 16 of them worked in the hospital pharmacy. 19 of them got the first grade of attestation in pharmacy (by 4 years of working experience in pharmacy and by passing exams). Pharmacists collected the following data: types and causes or errors, their interventions, drugs and time concerning errors, subjects making errors and patient's characteristics as age, gender, other drugs used and co-morbidities. All the data were processed by descriptive statistics. Background and Objective: There is no standard of care to prevent oral mucositis for patients with cancer treated by chemotherapy. Most common treatment is local (mouthwashes).",

These were administered from 2 to 4 times daily regardless the stability compounding. For physicians, prescriptions of mouthwashes were done for patients with specific toxic anticancer drugs (5-FU, anthracyclin, capecitabin and sunitinib), were concomitant with chemotherapy and systematic after radiotherapy. Conclusions: There are variations among clinical units in terms of mouth care regimen used. Treatment efficacy was never evaluated. Drug committee worked on guidelines in order to prescribe antifungal therapy only for curative aim or avoid anaesthetic drugs (swallowing difficulties). Good practices included, before chemotherapy, dental hygiene. Maintenance is realized by the patient himself (mouthrinses with alkalin solution or chlorhexidine). Analgesics can be taken orally in case of mouth pain. Design: The open, randomized, single-blind two-sequence, two-period crossover study design was performed. Setting: Under fasting conditions, each subject received a single oral dose of 10 mg olanzapine tablet as a test or reference formulation on 2 treatment days. The treatment periods were separated by a oneweek washout period. Main Outcome Measures: The plasma concentrations of drug were analyzed by a rapid and sensitive HPLC method with UV detection. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters included AUC0-24 h, AUC0-infinity, Cmax, t1/2, and Ke. The mean AUC0-infinity of olanzapine was 570.76 and 558.66 ng h/ml for the test and reference formulation, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of olanzapine was on average 15.82 ng/ml for the test and 15.73 ng/ml for the reference product. No statistical differences were observed for Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for test and reference tablets. 90% confidence limits calculated for Cmax and AUC0-infinity of cefixime were included in the bioequivalence range (97.3-109.2%). Conclusions: Therefore, the two tablet formulations were considered to be bioequivalent. Conclusions: Clinical pharmacists effectively validate 43% of these prescriptions but one third of prescriptions will inevitably remain validated by pharmacist residents during night and week-ends.",

We suggest to test clinical pharmacy activities related to economic indicators and to medication events reduction. Background and Objective: Education of patients with type 2 diabetes is a key point of non-medical management of that disease. Thus objective was evaluation of patients' knowledge about their disease and its management for further development of pharmaceutical care protocols. Design: Prospective cohort control study. Total 100 patients casually were divided in two equivalent groups: study group (n = 50), age 64.4 \u00b1 8.93, diabetes duration 9.02 \u00b1 6.74 who were questioned by face-to-face technique and received pharmaceutical care during the interview; control group (n = 50), age 61.6 \u00b1 8.89, diabetes duration 6.97 \u00b1 5.63 and filled in questionnaires without clinical pharmacist. Inclusive criteria were: presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, duration of the disease was not considered as criteria. Patients were inquired once following standardized questionnaire. All included patients could read and write. Two groups controlled their diabetes mostly by oral antidiabetics, only n = 6 in study group and n = 2 in control used insulin. Setting: Out-patient setting of Lviv Clinical hospital No4, endocrinologist's office. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of patients' knowledge about diabetes and self-monitoring in study and control groups. Results: Only 32.0% and 30.0% of inquired patients in both groups respectively stated that they possess good knowledge about diabetes. But as it was shown by evaluation of their level of knowledge through assessment of keeping to diet, regular physical activity, self monitoring it didn't conform completely. Diet was implemented by almost 70% of patients in two groups, while regular physical activity was declared only by 14.0% in study and 46% in control groups. Smoking was reported by 14.0% and 16.0% respectively. Next step was evaluation of self-monitoring. It has been revealed that only 12.0% and 10.0% of patients in two groups performed blood glucose monitoring at home; body weight was controlled by 58.0% and 50.0% respectively; blood pressure by 50.0% and 58.0% as well. Target level of blood pressure was achieved by 42.9% of subjects in study group and in 40.9% -in control. In study group foot examination was performed everyday by 70.0% of patients when in control only by 18.0%. No one from both groups evaluated glycated haemoglobin regularly as it is recommended by American Diabetes Association, those they couldn't state their present or previous parameter. Conclusions: It was estimated that knowledge about necessity of diet following, regular physical activity, and particularly -self-monitoring was very poor in diabetic patients, no regarding compliance which possibly also will be low. Even if patients stated good knowledge about the disease they had problems with self-monitoring. It is obvious that patients of this out-patient setting require adequate education, which should be a component of pharmaceutical care program implemented by the clinical pharmacist. Protocols of pharmaceutical care for these patients must be developed and include standard procedure of type 2 diabetes patients' education. Pharmacy Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, 2 Pharmacy Department, 3 Pharmacy department, Hospital Universitari Vall Hebron, Barcelona, Spain Background and Objective: Patients who are admitted for a programmed orthopedic surgery in a tertiary hospital are usually elderly and present high co-morbidity which makes therapy complexity increase. The objective is to evaluate whether a pharmaceutical care is necessary before patients hospital admission. Design: We analysed the domiciliary treatment in 1000 patients who attended to a pre-surgery visit. A form designed by the Pharmacy department and validated by Anaesthesiology Unit was delivered to the patient to fill in with domiciliary therapy. The average of prescribed drugs was 4.66 per patient, being this reduced to 3.9 drugs in patients younger than 65 and increased to 5.13 in patients older than 65. Over one third of patients (340/1000) were taken orally NonSteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs).",

This percentage belonged to 860 patients. Conclusions: The fact that a high percentage of patients over 64 with an orthopedic pathology take a considerable amount of drugs at home makes it necessary to monitories the therapy in order to minimise the iatrogenic problems during the admission. We have seen that this situation is so frequently (86%) in our study, so the Pharmacy Department has established a collaborative job with Anaesthesiologist Unit to reduce as much as possible therapy problems. levation. Through each tube, a 1500 ml nutritive solution was delivered on 24 h each day during one week. After dissolution in 5 ml water the PPIs were administered once a day after stopping of the enteral nutrition and rinsing of the tube with 5 ml of water. The tubes were then rinsed with 10 ml of water and the nutrition was started again. During each administration of PPI the suspension was collected at the tube exit in order to quantify the PPI by UV-spectrometry. Results: No tube was obstructed. The enteral nutrition mixture did not adversely affect the transit of lansoprazole through 8F nasogastric tubes. The transit of lansoprazole through the tube was complete and regular during the 7 days of the study (100.4 \u00b1 4.2). For esomeprazole the mean recovery of active ingredient was of 79.2 \u00b1 17.4 (coefficient of variation: 22%) This variability can be explained by the incomplete and inconstant dissolution of esomeprazole because of the low volume of water usable in paediatry. Conclusions: Orally disintegrating tablet of lansoprazole can be administered through 8F nasogastric tubes in a concomitant way to an enteral nutrition mixture. For esomeprazole there is a variability of the administered active ingredient. However enteral nutrition doesn't seem to affect the esomeprazole transit. Low volumes of water used in paediatry seem to be responsible for the variability. Results: We analyzed pharmacological treatment in 14 patients, with a mean age of 46 years old (27-77).

Background and Objective: Pharmacists' individualized counselling of patients has positive impacts on the management of hyperlipidaemia, including improved compliance and better treatment endpoints. The objective was to evaluate patient knowledge on hypercholesterolemia and its treatment and to assess impact of pharmacist intervention at the Lipid Clinic. Design: One hundred and fifty statin-treated patients were recruited by convenience sampling. Following completion of a scored pre-intervention questionnaire, the pharmacist provided education on hypercholesterolaemia and the use of statins. A leaflet was prepared, evaluated and distributed to the patients. The patients completed again the same questionnaire after the intervention (post-intervention). Results: Patient demographics: 42% (63) were males, 58% (87) were females, mean age was 59 years (range 32-76 years). A response rate of 71% was achieved with 98 patients completing both questionnaires. Following the educational intervention by the pharmacist, knowledge regarding the correct action to be taken if muscle pain or tenderness occur during statin therapy increased by 34% (p = 0). The awareness regarding the normal total blood cholesterol level increased by 22% (p = 0.0001) and the knowledge regarding the need for low-fat diet consumption during statin therapy increased by 27% (p = 0). Face and content validity of the patients' leaflet were strong. The average Gunning FOG Index obtained for the leaflet was 11.6 indicating good readability for individuals. The leaflet was endorsed by the local Health Promotion Department and 10 000 copies were printed and distributed to patients. Background and Objective: In order to assess the performance of Bayesian individualization of busulfan (BU) dosage regimens, venoocclusive disease (VOD) rate was monitored for paediatric patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Design: Consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic BMT with BU as conditioning regimen during five years period (January 2000 to Febuary 2006) were retrospectively reviewed (66 patients). Setting: VOD was major outcome variable. Preconditioning risk of VOD was estimated for each patient using a scoring system that included type of transplant, recipient CMV-positive status and total parenteral nutrition provided pretransplantation. A risk-adjusted cumulative sum method was used to compare observed versus predicted outcome by assigning a risk score, based on log-likelihood ratios, to each patient. Main Outcome Measures: The cumulative scores were sequentially plotted with preset control limits for ''signalling'' where results were substantially different than expected (doubling or halving of odds ratio). Results: Sixty-six children received BMT after oral busulfan-based conditioning regimen with median age 3.9 years, 63.6% of male. Median preconditioning risk of VOD was 0.34 range (0.23-0.84). Observed VOD rate was 16.7% (n = 11) which was 60.7% (17 patients) fewer than the expected number estimated by the risk score. The resulting risk-adjusted score for each patient was plotted sequentially. This plot adopted early a negative slope, crossing the lower control limit twice, after 27 and 66 patients, indicating improved results compared to those expected. Background and Objective: Geriatric patients use numerous drugs; because they have several concurrent diseases. 85% of those 65 years old and over have at least one chronic disease, 30% have 3 or more chronic diseases (1) . The purpose of this study is to evaluate data on the geriatrics' drug usage, assess the appropriateness of their drug treatment and identify their pharmaceutical care requirements. Design: Patients, who were 65 years old and over and live in a nursing home in the Anatolian part of Istanbul, were included in our study. By interviewing the patients, individualized information was obtained regarding the drugs they used, dose and frequency of drugs, the purposes of medication use and side effects, and who suggested or prescribed the drug. The patients at risk of drug induced problems were defined and a risk map was developed. Patients who have 4 or more risk factors were accepted as being in a high risk category. Setting: A nursing home. Main Outcome Measures: The demographic, clinical and drug data of the patients were recorded. The pills count that patients used daily and totally; side effects of the drugs; knowledge of patient's diseases and drugs; risk category of patients were assessed. Results: Polypharmacy was identified in 44% of those included in the study (total of 146 patients who take drug therapy). Generally it was observed that the drugs were prescribed at an appropriate dosage and time; however 80% of the patients didn't know for what they were taking drugs. Just 2 (1.4%) of the patients were aware of the conditions under which they should take drugs. 88 of the patients (60.3%) were not aware on how to and when they should receive their drugs. 24 patients (16.4%) were using their drugs by self-administration. The drugs of 122 patients (83.6%) were administered by their nurse. 8.75% of the patients were receiving no medication. Mean of number of drug used by patients was 5.89 \u00b1 3.61. 24.65% of patients were in a high risk category. Conclusions: As a result, drug effects alter due to polypharmacy, physiological and psychological changes. Drug treatment should be individualized and monitored in geriatrics. According to our results, patients have lack of knowledge on drug use and they have never been educated in this matter. It is necessary to begin meeting their Factor analytical technique can be either exploratory or confirmatory. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) remains one of the standard and most widely used methods to demonstrate construct validity of new instruments. It is used to help development of the instrument by revealing items that may be made redundant from the questionnaire because they contribute little to the presumed construct. The SEIP consists of 24 items in five domains and is scored on a four-to-fivepoint Likert scale. The aim of the study was to assess further psychometric property of the SEIP using principal component factor analysis (PCA). The strength of the inter-correlations among the items will be assessed by the presence of coefficients greater than 0.30 in the correlation matrix. If few correlations above this level are found, then factor analysis may not be appropriate. 193 issues were identified including 101 related to INR controls not performed and 27 due to a poor/no adjustement of the OAT dosage. 91% of the issues resolved following the pharmacist recommandations Conclusions: Computerized follow-up system allows to check INRs at the right date and to reduce the loss of results. Pharmacists' recommendations were well accepted by physicians. The impact of the follow-up on the reduction of the overdose incidence will have to be evaluated. Indications were hip (n = 72) and knee (n = 24) total replacement, other orthopaedic surgery of lower limbs (n = 13) and pulmonary embolism treatment (n = 1). Indications were ''off label'' for 7 patients with allergic reaction to heparine and 3 were not documented.",

This study aimed to evaluate the service; examine whether current clinical records were adequate; and test hypotheses investigating the association between clinical prediction rules (Center Criteria, CC), Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADT) and antibiotic prescription. Design: Initially, a semi-structured interview was conducted to gain an insight into the service. Data was retrospectively obtained from a standardised template (APEF), completed by a pharmacist at the time of each patient visit. Patient demographics and symptoms, RADT results, CC scores and follow up rates were analysed. Chi squared analyses were performed to investigate the aforementioned hypotheses. Setting: Jones Pharmacy, Spokane, Washington DC. Main Outcome Measures: Establishing adequacy and effectiveness of clinical records and relationships between clinical prediction rules, RADT and the antibiotic prescription. Results: Out of a total of 76 patients (mean age = 22; male = 33) there were 38 children (mean age = 9.9; male 16) and 38 adults (mean age = 33; male = 17). Ten (47.6%) of the 21 negative RADT results amongst children were referred to a primary healthcare provider. Out of 72 patients, 58 (80.6%) needed a RADT to be performed. Only 25 (34.7%) out of 72 patients were followed up. Significant association existed between RADT outcomes and the prescription of antibiotics (p = 0.001, p \\ 0.05). Conclusions: The findings from this study indicate that pharmacists need to be educated on the importance of a comprehensive clinical record. Inconsistent practices occur amongst pharmacists due to the conflict between US guidelines, particularly relating to the referral of children with negative RADT results to a primary care provider. The template was an efficient tool for data collection. Jones did not tailor their data collection for the purpose of the study: with improved data collection, Jones can yield information demonstrating the value of this service in future studies. only 9% of the 67 RHOPHYLAC prescriptions. 100 lg of anti D Ig were administered when NATEAD was available, whereas 200 lg with RHOPHYLAC excepted 4 times where 300, 400 or 600 lg were administered. 5 times the pharmacist has induced a modification of the posology.

The dose administered was not standard (200, 100 or 25 lg) and none prescription was conformed to the recommendations. Conclusions: This study shows that since RHOPHYLAC was commercialized (more expensive than NATEAD), the doses administered have doubled and the national recommendations (existent for adults only) are not followed. The reason is that hematologic patients may have a lot of transfusions so they want to protect them from any immunization, despite they are immunocompromised patients. New recommendations are needed, more applied to the practice and precising doses for children. The role of the pharmacist is then to remind physicians good practices of prescription. 1 Pharmacy, CHU Bic\u00eatre, Le Kremlin Bic\u00eatre, France Background and Objective: Computerized prescriptions are settled in clinical wards of our hospital. As pharmacist we have to validate those prescriptions and make recommendations to change part of the prescription such as dose, drug drug interactions. The objective of this study is to evaluate what kind of pharmaceutical interventions physicians really pay attention to. Design: The prescriptions had been analysed for three months in three medical care units by two pharmacists. One of them take part in the physician round in order to integrate particular medical practices. Pharmacist's interventions were recorded and categorized. The ratio of accepted interventions by the physicians was assessed. Setting: Three medical care units: 2 internal medicine services (acute care unit: 10 beds and long term hospitalisation: 18 beds) and acute geriatric unit (12 beds) in a 1000-bed French university hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Description and analysis of pharmacist's interventions in clinical wards. Results: We analysed 944 prescriptions. 104 interventions were performed and categorized. It should be noticed that 35% of pharmaceutical interventions were for misused of the new software: wrong selection of unit (75%) and redundant order (25%). The other 65% interventions were related to the prescription, our suggestions were as follow: time of administration (29%), adequate drug formulation (18%), dose adjustment (17%), therapeutic drug monitoring or biologic follow up (16%), to stop treatment (13%), route of administration (7%). Among these recommendations, 32% were the consequence of drug-drug interaction. 57% of the interventions led to change in the prescription. 34% of the physicians maintained their prescription despite the recommendations, mainly for staggered administration to avoid drug interaction. Background and Objective: Sliding scale insulin therapy (SSI) is a commonly used method of adjusting insulin in an attempt to control a patient's blood glucose levels. Previous research investigating SSI use in the hospital setting has determined that SSI therapy leads to poor glycaemic control and poor patient outcomes. Therefore, a Corrective Schedule for SSI therapy is recommended by The American Diabetes Association (ADA). The aims of this study were therefore to determine, for the first time whether SSI recipients experience problems in the home care setting and whether ADA guidelines on SSI use are being adhered to. Design: Eligible patients were identified through electronic records of patients admitted from 1st January to 31st December 2006. The list was utilised to obtain medical charts of the patients. Relevant information including patient demographics, blood glucose readings and documented problems were recorded using a standardised data collection form. Chi-squared statistical analysis was determined using SPSS Version 14.0. Setting: The Visiting Nurses Association (VNA) home care agency, Spokane, Washington State, USA. Main Outcome Measures: Use of 'traditional SSI therapy' versus 'corrective' version recommended by ADA. Results: Of the total 117 (male = 45, female = 72; mean age = 67.37, age range = 34-96) patient medical records examined in this study, 36.75% (n = 43) had at least one problem documented with their insulin regimen. The most common problem that affected over a quarter of the population, 25.64% (n = 30) was 'lack of control' which included any hyper-and hypoglycemic events. More than a third of sliding scale recipients, 37.61% (n = 44) had preprandial blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl. In total 70.94% (n = 83) of patients were prescribed the non-recommended Traditional SSI therapy and only 29.06% (n = 34) were using the recommended Corrective SSI therapy. Conclusions: The findings of this study support previous concerns that SSI use is prone to problems and poor glycaemic control. Furthermore, this study has established the lack of adherence to the ADA recommended use of the Corrective SSI schedule in the home care setting. It is hoped that this study will influence use of SSI in hospital and home care agencies as well as national and international guidelines. Background and Objective: Prolonged (more than 48 hours) mechanical ventilation (MV) is the most important factor associated with nosocomial pneumonia (1) . Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is differentiated in to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if the process arose after the patient has been receiving at least 24 h of MV (2) . VAP is defined as an inflamation of the lung parenchima caused by infectious agents not present or incubating at time MV was started (1). Design: Longitudinal, prospective and observational study. Setting: We made a prospective evaluation of the clinical files of a patient population of 14 cases with VAP diagnosed between April 2006 and December 2006, who were assisted in Hospital Garcia de Orta. A total of 14 patients, 57% male and 43% female, aged 62 \u00b1 15 years were diagnosed with VAP. VAP was defined as new positive respiratory culture after at least 24 hours of MV. Main Outcome Measures: These data sugest that the increase of PCR for documented VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ocurred more frequently with ceftazidim than other antibiotics. Results: In all VAP episodes, an aetiologic microrganism, was isolated from 26 hemocultures and 22 bronchic secretions. The gramnegative bacteria were the most commonly isolated microorganisms (68%). We collected PCR and leucocytes data of seven documented schedules (n = 7) for erradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: (1) ceftazidime (2 g q8 h) + gentamicin (5 mg/Kg qd), (2) ceftazidime (2 g q8 h) + ciprofloxacin (200 mg q12 h), (3) Piperacillin-tazobactam (4 g/500 mg q6 h) + aztreonam (2 g q8 h), (4) Piperacillintazobactam (4 g/500 mg q6 h) + gentamicin (5 mg/Kg qd), (5) Piperacillin-tazobactam (4 g/500 mg q6 h) + amikacin (15 mg/Kg qd), (6) imipenem-cilastatine (500 mg q6 h) + gentamicin (5 mg/Kg qd), (7) meropenem (1 g q8 h) + gentamicin (5 mg/Kg qd). The mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 10 days. There was an increase of the PCR values of the patients who were scheduled with ceftazidim but in the other groups there was a decrease of this parameter. The number of leucocytes didn't have any impact of the PCR variation (p [ 0.05, t-test). Considering the group of the 14 patients, 75% (6) of the positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were sensitive to either Ceftazidim or a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam were treated with ceftazidim instead. Conclusions: This approach provides useful information on the relation of host defenses and the clinical outcome. It is also useful to study the prevalence of acquired resistance to several antibiotics that may be used in documented antibiotherapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Background and Objective: rFVIIa is increasingly used as rescue therapy in uncontrolled bleeding, however little information is available regarding its safety and efficacy in this indication. -indication for use: massive bleeding when first-line treatment (surgical control of bleeding, use of blood products) has failed; -to achieve the correction of factors that may interfere with coagulation (hypothermia, severe acidosis, hypocalcemia); -before administration of rFVIIa the patient or his family should be informed about the treatment; -the prescription of FVIIa should be initialized by a referent physician -to conform the dose of 60 mu/kg in cardiac surgery patient. Conclusions: Several solutions have been proposed to the physicians to improve their professional practices: to develop an algorithm for use of rFVIIa, to fill in a checklist before administration of rFVIIa to be sure to follow the guidelines, \u2026 This study will be extended in others departments using rFVIIa as gastroenterology and traumatology.

Background and Objective: Hip fracture is a major public health problem with a high incidence and prevalence in people aged 65 years and older. Changes in body composition and organ function, drug-drug interactions, and co-morbidities should be taken into account in the pharmaceutical care of this group of patients. The aim of this study is to analyse pharmacological treatment of elderly patients ongoing hip fracture in order to improve pharmaceutical care in this group of patients. Design: A prospective pilot-study was performed during one month, (May-June 2007) in 14 patients admitted in a tertiary hospital ongoing hip fracture. These variables were recorded for each patient: sex, age, body mass index (BMI), diseases antecedents, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance estimated by Cockroft-Gault formula, serum albumin levels, lymphocytes count, sodium and potassium levels. Drug treatment was recorded from pharmacy database. Setting: Patients with hip fracture admitted in a tertiary hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Prescription profile in elderly patients with hip fracture. Results: Of 14 patients, 9 were female. Mean age was 80.4 years old (68-96). Mean BMI was 27.6 (n = 10, range 21-35). Albumin levels were lower than 3.4 g/dL in 10 patients. Sodium levels were out of the normal range in 7 patients. Five patients had creatinine clearance lower than 50 ml/min, 2 of them less than 30 ml/min. We analysed 119 prescriptions which included 50 drugs. They were classified in 5 categories: not adjustment required (16 drugs), adjustment required (12) , inappropriate based in Beer's criteria (1), precaution in elderly people (10) and not enough information available in geriatric population (11) . Mean number of drugs per patient was 9 (5-15). Of 119 prescriptions revised, 22 required adjustment and 15 of them were correctly adjusted. Of 24 prescriptions in precaution group 18 were correctly prescribed. Conclusions: Dosage adjustment or precaution was required in 40% of prescriptions. Of these, 75% (33/46) needed dosage adjustment according to renal function. Besides, 36% of patients had renal function alteration. Thus, it is important to improve pharmaceutical care in this group of patients specially for those drugs that need dosage adjustment in renal failure.

Six pharmacists (18.8%) answered after the first sending of the questionnaire and 14 (43.8%) answered after they received the remainder. Fourteen pharmacists (43.8%) did not answer. All the pharmacists were satisfied with the way of transmission. However, one of them suggested having the information sent by E-mail. Seventeen professionals (85%) thought information was useful and 9 (45%) thought that it was sufficient for their practice. Only 6 pharmacists (30%) encouraged us to continue the programme; the others did not express any opinion about its efficiency. Moreover, none of them called us even though we suggested so. Conclusions: This experiment seems to be interesting and to correspond to the needs of the pharmacists. It would also be an easy way to make dispensation safe. Nevertheless, many problems appeared: much time spent and the difficulty making an exhaustive follow-up of all the patients thus limiting the application of this kind of programme to larger cohort. Background and Objective: To make a proposal of software that facilitates the analysis of clinical relevance of antiretroviral drug interactions, in the medical prescription, dispensation and Dader methodology of pharmaceutical care study phase. Design: Pubmed and other databases evaluate revision. Antiretroviral drug interactions were classified in four levels according to probability and severity of the interaction. The probability was grouped in 3 categories: defined, probable and possible. So, severity was grouped in 3 categories: serious, moderate, and slight. The levels are: Level 1 (serious and defined or probable); Level 2 (serious and possible, moderate and defined or probable); Level 3 (moderate and possible, slight and defined or probable) and Level 4 (slight and possible).

Conclusions: 3694 interactions were classified, which 94% were drug-drug interactions; as well, 94.2% were pharmacokinetics interactions and in their majority (78.3%) were mediated by the enzymatic inhibition. About 36.7% of interactions were level 1 and 2, this levels of greater clinical relevance and whose the alert generated by software are contributions that help to analyze and take decisions with respect to the handling from the same ones. outcomes (e.g. mortality, morbidity, adverse drug reactions.); a profile of patients and clinical activities; an update of task description based on evidences and context. Results: Studies demonstrate that pharmacists have an impact on selected clinical outcomes following clinical pharmacy activities (e.g. drug therapy monitoring, pharmacokinetics and education for medical and paramedical professional). Patients admitted in the intensive care unit have a higher level of complexity of care than average patients in the hospital, but a similar length of stay. For pharmacy services, their drug cost per admission is higher (503$CAD vs 380$CAD), as the number of pharmacist paid hours per admission (1.1 vs 0.88) and the number of pharmaceutical interventions per admission (2.05 vs 1.74).",

Design: Comparison between two different organization ways: before the implementation (pharmacy order by nurses chief) and 6 months afterwards (automated order and arrangement by a chemist assistant). Setting: Surgery intensive care unit (8 beds) in the Pitie-Salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re Hospital (GHPS), a large teaching hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Study ''Before and after'': Follow up of prescribing and dispensing matches, analysis of time repartition between nurses and chemist assistants, follow up of line of emergency order, analysis of the results of a nurses satisfaction survey and costs study of drug consumption and drug storage. Results: This study, performed over 50 days, showed very small differences between prescribing and administered medications (1% before versus 4% afterwards = no significant difference). Organization: Implementation of automated device allowed a better division of activities, the management by nurses chief of the pharmacy order decreased (from 9% to 2% of their weekly working time), because this part was attributed to the chemist assistant (15% of their weekly working time). Satisfaction: 70% of nurses preferred the automated system and especially because they find that this system was safe. In the same time, 80% of them appreciate with the new relationship with the Pharmacy Department. Costs Study: a huge decrease of the storage: -34% of cost (14,819 \u20ac versus 9,806 \u20ac) and -13% of references number (296 versus 230). In the same time, over 2 months, the drug consumption of the unit has been reduced by 30% (-11,680 \u20ac). Conclusions: Even if the study did not demonstrate a decrease of the number of medication errors (due to the tiny number of them as much before than afterwards the implementation), this automated system allowed a safety access to the drugs (biometric system) and contributed to reduce the risk of medication errors. The other great interest is the real involvement of the pharmacy in the clinical wards. The presence of the chemist assistant ensures a better management of drug storage (decrease of emergency order), a direct follow up and allowed a contact with nurses. Results: In 2007 in France, 5 intracranial stents with various technical characteristics are available (steel or nitinol, learning curve: 2 to 5 procedures, follow-up of patients is from 6 months to 2 years). Stents with a hight radial force are used for intracranial artery angioplasty. More precisely, those devices are implanted in patients with recidive stroke, with an intracranial stenosis C50% and who had failed medical therapy. Two stents are identified in this therapeutic use: Wingspan \u00d2 (Boston) and Pharos \u00d2 (Micrus). About 120 implantations are estimated for 2007 in France, whom 35 implantations (cost = 105,000 \u20ac) in Paris hospitals. The need is not actually clearly identified: the number of eligible patients is not already known and not systematically searched by neuroradiologists. So number of implantations will evolve. 4 intracranial stents are used in combination with detachable coils embolization in patients with wide-necked cerebral aneurysms: L\u00e9o \u00d2 (Balt), Neuroform 3 \u00d2 (Boston), Entreprise \u00d2 (Cordis) and Pharos \u00d2 (Micrus, double therapeutic use). For 2007, about 230 to 300 implantations are estimated in France (10 to 25% of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysm), whom 40 implantations (cost = 116 000 \u20ac) in Paris hospitals. Those data might increase. Indeed, there is evidence of the effectiveness of stent implantation in intracranial aneurysm which generates lower rate of aneurysm recanalisation. Conclusions: 5 intracranial stents has been identified in 2 precise therapeutic uses. However, an exact quantitative assessment can not be realised: those medical devices are innovating and are actually changing the management of patients concerned. Those quantitative results might evolve. Further similar studies will be necessary in order to follow up those innovating therapeutic uses in neuroradiology departments and to estimate their cost impact, actually negligible.

But the really administered quantity cannot be imputed to the patient because the software of inventory control and invoicing does not manage the fraction of flasks. Nevertheless, according to the French law we must express under fractional shape the quantities of cytotoxics, which are administered by stay to the patients for the most expensive drugs. Background and Objective: Since July 2006, financing of drugs in Belgian hospitals is based on a lump-sump system. This decision favours efforts leading to more rational use of medication like for example the sequential treatment. Efforts like posters, recommendation letters and information rounds were part of the strategy. Since 01-11-2007 a clinical pharmacist puts also attention on this subject by contacting physicians and nurses regarding individual drug therapies. Documenting the results of interventions suggested by a clinical pharmacist is often quite difficult. The number of DDD of intravenous administered drug versus the total amount of DDD [oral + IV] of the particular drug administered has been described. This parameter can be disturbed by the use of the oral form over a long period of time or by the early discharge of patients combined with a continuation of the therapy at home. To follow up the sequential treatment on the emergency department, this parameter seems to be accurate by the fact that the stay of the patient here is between 1 and 2 days. Cost savings by sequential treatment of paracetamol and levofloxacin were 1274 euro and 2025 euro, calculated from the start of the activities the clinical pharmacist (for 8 months).",

Background and Objective: ACE inhibitors are used for controlling blood pressure, treating heart failure and preventing kidney damage in people with hypertension or diabetes. Although ACE inhibitors are generally well-tolerated by the most individuals, they are not free of side effects. Dry cough is one of the most common side effects seen in patients during ACE inhibor therapy. In this study, we have evaluated the incidence of dry cough that appears during the ACE inhibitors therapy and relationships with the other coughing factors and the other side effects that may appear. Design: The questionnaire was applied on 304 ambulatory patients (144 m/160 f) who have used or been using ACE inhibitors and 100 hypertension patients as control group who use also anti-hypertensive drugs except ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors, and the reactions against the dry cough were determined by pharmacist's questionnaire on the patients who come to the community pharmacy. Results: Dry cough was observed on the 65 patients out of 304, during their using of ACE inhibitors (21%). 24% of male patients and 19% of female patients were having a cough. The 5 patients out of 100 (5%) from control group were having a cough. The incidence of dry cough that appears on the patients who use ACE inhibitors were; silazopril 28%, ramipril 26%, lisinopril 21%, fosinopril 17%, qinapril 14%, perindopril 13%, enalapril 11% and trandolapril 10%. The treatments of 32 patients out of 65 who complain from coughing during the therapy of ACE inhibitors were changed with angiotensin receptor antagonists and calcium antagonists by their physician. Treatment changes were resulted in increasing in the cost by 382.08 YTL monthly if it was calculated on the base of generics.",

The pharmacist can play an important role in determining side effects such as dry cough and refer the these patients to physician. Patient counselling and drug therapy monitoring in the community pharmacies will increase the compliance and provide better outcomes in many chronic diseases. Setting: Community in _ Istanbul Main Outcome Measures: Visual Analouge Scale (VAS) was used for assessment of pain. The universe of the study consisted of randomly selected 210 women and 190 men (n = 400). A pilot study was run on 15 individuals from different occupation groups to determine the validity and intelligibility of the questionnaire. Results: The data were analyzed using a SPSS 10.0 program. The level of significance was accepted as p \\ 0.05. The results show that women experience more intense pain than men; their mean VAS score is higher than men (6 vs 4). Headache is the most common type of pain (41.5%) and also its VAS scores reached the highest level (9) (10) . This pain is especially caused by migraine and hypertension. In addition, 56% of questionees prefer to take an analgesic drug in order to manage their pain problem. It was recorded that especially Non-steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and preparations containing paracetamol are the first choice in pain management. Most respondees took analgesics when pain begun (37.5%), when pain increased (39.5%) or when was intolerable (20.5%). Conclusions: The majority of those who participated in the study took their analgesic medication without consulting a health professional. This indicates a high level of self medication in our population. This gives rise to a number of potential drug problems such as NSAIDs usage in gastrointestinal disorders, hypertension and renal failure. Although many participants used their drugs in a rondom and improper way, unfortunately the pharmacist was rated second to last as a drug consultant. Background and Objective: Many patients visit the pharmacy for their oral problems like toothache and ask for appropriate pain relievers. The purpose of this study is to examine the attitude and role of pharmacists, dentists and non-health workers towards solving of dental and oral health (like management of toothache).

Background and Objective: In 1965 Hibbard and Smithells suggested a link between inadequate maternal intake of folic acid and neural tube defects in their offspring (1) . Consequently, it has been recommended that all women planning to become pregnant should consume additional folic acid before conception and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Despite these recommendations, periconceptional intake of additional folic acid is still low in many developed countries and a substantial percentage of women are not aware of its benefits (2) . Design: A questionnaire was used in a face-to-face encounter. Setting: Postnatal wards of a teaching and a private hospital in Iran.

Before type II diabetes stage, people almost always have ''pre-diabetes''; in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. While some people with type-II diabetes have symptoms, the majority may go 7-10 years without apparent symptoms. Because some of the symptoms for diabetes mimic other diseases or conditions, makes it harder to predict an precise diagnosis without any additional information. The purpose of this study is early diagnosis of pre-diabetes, prevention or delay of the complications with a collaboration of community pharmacists and patients. Design: Pharmacists used a structured questionnaire containing questions concerning demographic data and informations which indicate prediabetes symptoms. Setting: Four community pharmacies in Istanbul. Main Outcome Measures: Data: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), genetic predisposition, blood pressure, pysical activity and hypoglycemia symptoms. Results: One hundred people were screened for undiagnosed diabetes. and the risk for pre-diabetes is evaluated according fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and total oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test results. Blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl with the FPG test and 140 and 199 mg/dl with OGTT test are considered as pre-diabetes. Conclusions: Diagnosis of pre-diabetes can prevent the development of type II diabetes and making changes in nutrition and increasing the level physical activity may even be able to return the elevated blood glucose levels to the normal levels.",

Children are more vulnerable because of their inherent interests for knowing the environment besides ignorance and carelessness of adults. Drugs are among the leading offending agents in children poisonings. The services of drug and/or poison information centers have been regarded as one of the main challenge areas of clinical pharmacy practice. Being a pioneer in Turkey, Hacettepe Drug and Poison Information Center (HIZBIM), has been run for 15 years in working hours basis. Objective: The objective is to evaluate the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of drug poisonings in children, thus, to contribute to clarify the actual ''intoxication profile'' and identify necessary measures for the children in Turkey. Design: The data of childhood (aged \\ 17 years) poisoning enquiries received by HIZBIM between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2005 were collected retrospectively and analyzed with SPSS 11.5 \u00d2 Setting: HIZBIM is affiliated to Hacettepe University, Faculty of Pharmacy Main Outcome Measures: Categorization and comparison of data of children intoxicated with drugs during ten years Results: Children were involved in 54% of all poisoning cases and 63% of those cases were due to drugs. There was no gender difference among very young children, however, girls dominated as the age increases (p \\ 0.05). 88% of the cases were accidental, and analgesics were involved in 40% of the accidental poisonings (p \\ 0.05). While the most offending agent group was analgesics in children younger than 12 years (p \\ 0.05), multiple drug ingestions were the main causes of the cases involved older children (p \\ 0.05). Multiple drugs were mostly encountered (63%) in suicidal attempts where the dominant gender was girls (75%) (p \\ 0.05). The most frequently reported symptoms indicated central nervous system involvement almost in all intoxication cases and in all age groups. Conclusions: Pediatric poisonings are rather high in Turkey like many other countries and drugs are accounted for mostly in those injuries whether accidental or suicidal exposures. Some regulations, the attitudes of physicians, pharmacists, and parents and other care givers make contributions to that outcome. In the prevention of childhood drug intoxications it is essential to make cooperation between drug manufacturers, regulatory authorities, health professionals, and families, besides increasing social awareness.",

Background and Objective: The increasing use of performanceenhancing substances and methods in sport threatens not only the meaning and the ethical value of the sport itself, but also the health of the athletes. This study aims to assess the drug utilization profiles of the amateur football players, as well as their attitudes and knowledge on ''performance enhancing drugs''. Design: This study was conducted on 62 male players of the amateur football league. The players were asked to fill in a standard questionnaire, where information about their drug utilization profiles as well as their attitudes and knowledge on ''performance enhancing drugs'' were sought through various questions. Setting: Various amateur football clubs in Turkey. Main Outcome Measures: Drug consumption rates of the players. Answers to the pre-prepared questions. Results: The age of the players ranged between 16 and 30 years. Forty-four (71%) players thought that drugs have a positive impact on sports performance; while 29% did not share this idea. The resource of this idea was a team-member for 45.2%, the trainer for 25.8%, sports magazines for 25.8% and a family-member for 3.2%.

Background and Objective: Psychiatric disorders and opiate misuse are associated with chronic pain syndromes, but their incidence in fibromyalgia (FMS) is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify if the incidence of affective disorders, and opioid misuse, was more common in patients with FMS than those with other forms of nonmalignant chronic pain. Design: A prospective, cohort study was carried out involving 66 patients, who were internally referred to a chronic pain management program. Subjects with a working diagnosis of FMS were matched by age (mean = 53) and sex (82% female) and compared to a control group of patients with alternative forms of non-malignant chronic pain. Individuals were compared using urine toxicological screens, drugrelated criminal convictions, diagnoses of affective disorders, and responses to the following inventories: Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients in Pain, the Pain Disability Index, the Personal Health Questionnaire and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Patients also underwent a standardised physical examination using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines to diagnose FMS. Setting: This was a quantitative, hypothesis-testing cohort study, conducted in an academic general internal medicine practice. Main Outcome Measures: Diagnosis of fibromyalgia, clinician's awareness of ACR guidelines, pain intensity and impact of fibromyalgia on physical and psychosocial activity. Results: Response rate was 67% (n = 44; mean age = 53, median = 52, age range = 35-80; male = 8); the most common Background and Objective: The increase in the frequency of the metabolic syndrome and its implication, in the development of ischemic cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus, represent a real public health problem and of much interest in the medical field. Otherwise, the cardiovascular pathologies are twice more frequent among chronics psychotics patients, for that reason we were interested in the prevention of these pathologys.

The main off-label indications were prevention of hemorrhagic risk of antiplatelet agent (23%), hemoglobin decrease(16%), anticoagulant co-prescription(13%), steroids co-prescription(6%). Conclusions: This prospective study confirms the large prescription of PPI therapy in a department of internal medicine. Nevertheless, this study highlights the difficulties to interrupt this well tolerated therapy after the first prescription by family physicians. Clinical pharmacist interventions in the department consist of explaining the difference of indications between pantoprazole 20 mg and pantoprazole 40 mg, he makes physicians aware of prescribing PPI therapy with a cautious reweighted cost/benefit consideration. Background and Objective: To develop and validate a system for regulatory authorities to provide feedback to companies on the quality of their submissions while companies report to authorities on the quality of the review. A standardised report format will allow performance comparisons within and across companies and agencies.",

Background and Objective: Adherence with chronic medication such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has repeatedly been reported to be low. Non-adherence could be related to inadequate knowledge of ICS' actions and lack of ICS' instructions on the use of inhalers. This has not been reported previously to our knowledge among new users of ICS who discontinued ICS treatment early. The aim of the study is therefore to describe, among new users of ICS that discontinued, their knowledge of ICS' actions and whether they were instructed on the use of their inhaler. Design: A cross-sectional study among new users of ICS that discontinued use. Patients were interviewed by telephone and their GP received a mailed questionnaire. Automated dispensing records of all patients were retrieved. Setting: 15 community pharmacies in the Netherlands.

Background and Objective: To assess the quality of Antibiotic Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in routine hospital practice and establish baseline status for rationally defining future actions aimed at improving it (by implementation of clinical pharmacy services). Design: 4 months prospective observational study with validated data collection form using predefined criteria for TDM quality assessment. Descriptive statistics performed with SPSS 13.0 for Windows \u00d2 . Setting: Orthopaedic surgery, general surgery, neurosurgery, vascular surgery, haematology and pulmonary wards of a 400 beds teaching hospital, using vancomycin twice daily and amikacin once daily administration schemes. Main Outcome Measures: Adherence to predefined criteria for sample timing, information transmission, and follow up of dose adjustment recommendations. Criteria: (i) sampling time: less than \u00b115 min (amikacin) and \u00b130 min (vancomycin) deviation from preset time for peak levels; less than \u00b130 min for trough levels; (ii) information transmission: patient's full name, dose, schedule of administration, time of previous and current dose, actual time of peak and trough level sampling; (iii) quality of the analysis [internal and external controls]; (iv) acceptance of dose adjustment (more than 10%) recommendations. Results: Inclusion: 94 patients (46 vancomycin and 65 amikacin courses). Correct sampling times: (i) peak levels: 39% (n = 15) for vancomycin and 11% (n = 9) for amikacin, (ii) trough levels: 63% (n = 51) for both antibiotics. Correct information transmission: 55% (n = 83). No issue noted for the quality of the laboratory analyses. Implementation of recommendations: 32% (n = 66) for vancomycin and 18% (n = 17) for amikacin. Conclusions: Incorrect sampling times and deficiencies in communication between the ward and the laboratory are key factors affecting the quality of TDM, leading to dosage adjustment recommendations that are only infrequently implemented. The companion abstract examines the underlying reasons for such poor performance of the TDM process using a qualitative approach. Corresponding values of D were: Background and Objective: To evaluate the relation between vancomycin and amikacin pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in an intensive care unit population. Design: Data from intensive care unit patients were collected over a 48-month period, through a retrospective review of medical records and Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) reports. Patients were included only if at least two blood samples, at steady state conditions, had been drawn.

Prescribing adherence to local guidelines for handling infections of ears and upper airways and antibiotic prescribing is of both local and national concern. Increasing antibiotic resistance is one reason, cost and patient quality of care are others. The objective of this study was to investigate physician adherence to clinical guidelines at the out-of-hours primary care clinic in T\u00e4by. Design: A retrospective study. Clinical case notes were scrutinised for all patients seeking care for problems with ear, nose, throat, fever, cough or cold between January 1 and March 31 2007. Data was analysed for patients who were diagnosed with specified ear or upper respiratory infections. Laboratory tests taken and antibiotic prescriptions were anonymously documented. Antibiotic prescription filling dates were investigated. Setting: Husl\u00e4karjouren, the out-of-hours primary care clinic in T\u00e4by. Main Outcome Measures: Adherence to and fulfillment of local therapeutic guidelines and professional quality criteria was defined with respect to immediate, delayed or no prescription, drug choice, dose and duration and the use of diagnostic tests. Adherence was defined as complete or not, and deviations from the guidelines were separately analysed. Prescription filling was analysed with respect to time from clinic visit to pharmacy visit. Results: Data from 1077 patient visits were analysed. Adherence to local guidelines was disappointingly low. General treatment of infections was only according to guidelines in 44% of the cases and only laboratory testing met the quality criteria. Adherence to antibiotic prescribing guidelines was even lower, only 22% of antibiotic prescriptions were completely according to local guidelines. 93% of all antibiotic prescriptions were filled within one day from the visit to the clinic. Conclusions: Communicating guidelines to prescribers and continuous follow up of prescribing behaviour is essential for improving patient care and decreasing the risk of antibiotic resistance in the community. This study exposes gaps in the quality of care that may not be picked up by traditional follow up measurments. Studies with a wider scope and in depth analysis of reasons for nonadherence to guidelines are warranted if antibiotic use is to be improved. 3 .14 lines after other therapies. Before bortezomib one patient received therapeutic with thalidomide/dexametasone, one VAD, one cyclophosphamide (CTX), three followed by VAD, one MP followed VAD and followed CTX, and another with VAD followed by CTX. The therapeutic selection followed the NCCN guidelines in all patients. The average number of cycles with bortezomib has 4.14. From the 8 patients, 2 stopped, one had a generalized face oedema bortezomib related, although the disease was in remission, and another died by sepsis not related with this drug. In relation to bortezomib's effectiveness, 6 (75%) patients had a very good response, since the immunoglobulin decreased and three (25%) of these patients are actually at consolidation cycles (7th and 8th). Conclusions: The use of Bortezomib in our hospital was according the NCCN guidelines and the experience was very positive. Nevertheless, and considering also the high cost of this therapeutic, we consider very important to continue to follow up this group in order to evaluate the rate of response to bortezomib during time.",

Relative doses and dose changes after conversion from rHuEPO to DA were estimated using an initial rHuEPO:DA 200:1 conversion ratio (Aranesp \u00d2 EU label). Study quality assessment was performed using the Downs-Black checklist, a standard method used to assess the quality of a study using EBM principles.",

            "text": "Results: The search yielded 34 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Upon further review, 19 studies were excluded (14 had unextractable data, 3 were retrospective analyses, and 2 had predialysis pts). The remaining 15 studies were analyzed: 3 RCTs with parallel control groups, 3 cross-over trials, and 9 observational conversion studies (table) . The studies yielded data on 3,380 rHuEPO and 3,164 DA pts, with a mean treatment duration being 21 weeks. We found the average study quality was 70%, with RCTs (n = 663) having a higher quality score (87%) than crossover (72%; n = 497) or observational (66%; n = 5384) studies. There was a notable dose efficiency observed when pts were converted to DA from rHuEPO. This effect was greater in the RCTs (27.5%) than in crossover (19.1%) or observational (12.1%) studies. Conclusions: We found a notable DA dose efficiency (up to 27%) in pts who were converted from rHuEPO to DA using a 200:1 conversion ratio. Additionally, studies with the highest quality scores (eg RCTs) had the greatest observed dose efficiency while non controlled studies scored lowest in both quality and dose efficiency. Background and Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the frequency of otitis media and the assessment of its relationship to patients' socio-demographic characteristics and determination of systemic and topical drug profiles in otitis media.",

            "text": "It was observed that antibiotics (oral and/or topical), analgesics, decongestants, and topical corticosteroids were prescribed at rates of 99.1%, 88.0%, 76.8%, and 7.4%; respectively. Prescribed oral antibiotics were cephalosporins [cefixime (17.6%), cefuroxime axetil (15.6%) and cefaclor (8.3%)], amoxicillin-clavulanate, and floroquinolones [levofloxacin (10.7%) and ciprofloxacin (9.8%)] at rates of 41.5%, 38%, and 20.5% respectively. Rifampin and ciprofloxacin were prescribed as topical antibiotics at rates of 87.5%, 12.5% respectively. When the number of drug used by the patients was evaluated, 38 were on quadri-therapy, 126 on tri-therapy, 46 on dualtherapy and 6 on mono-therapy. 89 patients were treated with the combination of antibiotic-analgesic-decongestants. Conclusions: Our study indicated that the most frequently prescribed drugs were antibiotics in otitis media. Clinical pharmacists have a potential role in rational antibiotic use by providing clinical pharmacy services such as antibiotic selection, drug monitoring and patient education; so that they would reduce both antibiotic resistance and treatment costs. Background and Objective: The sampling method is crucial for the physical and chemical quality control of antineoplastic chemotherapies. This step acts upon the dosage correctness and may lead to risk of needle-stick or cytotoxic drug projection during its achievement. Beyond, the sampling time must be as short as possible and the sample be directly placed on the analysis machine. This work evaluates a new and improved sampling method, specially worked out for this application. Design: This study was designed to ensure the vial airtightness and the volume sampling. A cost and time study was also performed. Setting: The vial is an HPLC type, Chromacol \u00d2 2 mL, 12 9 32 mm DP = 500 hPa, (Interchim \u00d2 , Montlu\u00e7on, 03). The vial is airtight thanks to a PTFE silicon septum set with an aluminium collar. The vials are vacuum-packed in a PVC bag (DIDOP \u00d2 , Compi\u00e8gne, 60). A void test was led on unpacked vials up to 3 months, to ensure a maximum conservation, and showed a filling volume of 448 \u00b1 90 lL, very close of the 500 lL target. Main Outcome Measures: One week samples have been weighed to calculate the filling volume in real conditions of use. This volume is 747 \u00b1 17 lL ranging from 220 to 1130 lL. Since this sampling method has been set up, the percentage of refusal for insufficient volume is lower than 0.1%. This technique was compared to the previous method in terms of cost: vial, sampling adjuncts, handlingtime and waste. The vials are filled with a secured double-needle Eclipse \u00d2 , 32 mm, 7/10 (Becton-Dickinson \u00d2 , Le-Pont-de-Claix, 38). Results: About 10,000 chemotherapies controls are made each year in the hospital. The vial and the sampling device costs are higher than the previous (1 \u20ac versus 0.25 \u20ac, and 0.29 \u20ac versus 0.05 \u20ac). On the contrary, the handling-time for sampling was estimated 1 minute lower (which corresponds to 0.388 \u20ac less per sample). Furthermore, the waste weight is 1 gram lighter with the new devices, which costs 0.003 \u20ac less in the waste disposal. The total cost difference is 0.60 \u20ac higher per sample. An estimation of a needle-stick accident has been carried out, with the human cost (pharmacist technician's compensation and medical consulting) and the equipment including gloves, sterilization devices and post-sterilization check; the lowest estimation cost of an accident is 274.58 \u20ac. Conclusions: The secured needle makes the sampling operation easier for the workers and it lowers the risk of needle-stick. Besides, this closed system avoids completely the antineoplastic contact for the manipulators during the confection and the control. Moreover, this system allows to secure the sample library. Background and Objective: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Kuwait ranks amongst the highest in world at about 15%. Diabetes is a well recognized independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased prevalence of several other known risk factors for CVD in Kuwaiti diabetics further increases the risk. Since CVD is the leading cause of death in Kuwait, the high incidence of diabetes has major social and economic impact. Diabetics aged 40 years or older have, in general, an increased 10-year risk of developing CVD compared to younger patients but there have been no audits involving this group of patients in Kuwait. The objective of this study was therefore to audit achievement of CVD risk factor goals according to PT-188 Pharmacotherapy of first-episode psychosis in the psychiatry clinics of the North Estonia Regional Hospital (NERH) and the Tartu University Hospital (TUH) Jana Lass 1 , Agnes M\u00e4nnik 2 , Simon J. Bell 3 1 Pharmacy Department, North Estonia Regional Hospital, Tallinn, 2 Institute of Pharmacy, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, 3 Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Background and Objective: Treatment guidelines provide recommendations for the evidence-based treatment of schizophrenia. Adherence to these guidelines is often sub-optimal. Our aim was to compare and contrast the pharmacotherapy of first-episode psychosis at the NERH and TUHs, with respect to both treatment location and evidence-based guidelines. Design: Retrospective study. Case notes for consecutive patients with schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorders (ICD-10) admitted to the NERH and TUH between September 2005 and September 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Setting: Psychiatry clinics of two tertiary care hospitals -NERH and TUH. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures included the choice and daily dose of antipsychotics, incidence of antipsychotic polypharmacy and reasons for changes in therapy plan. Results: 113 patients form NERH and 29 from TUH were included in the final analyses. Median age (SD) of the patients was 35 (13.8) in the NERH and 39(15.2) in the TUH Patients were hospitalised for longer in the NERH than in the TUH, 31 (17.4) vs. 23(17.2). The most frequently prescribed antipsychotic was risperidone at both study locations -37% of prescriptions in the NERH and 57% in the TUH. Conventional antipsychotics were administered twice often in the NERH than in the TUH. In the TUH olanzapine was administered in higher prescribed daily doses than in the NERH. The number of antipsychotics prescribed per patient was higher in the NERH than in the TUH -1.7 vs 1.3. The prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy was 13.3% among the patients in the NERH, whereas only one patient was treated with antipsychotic polypharmacy in the TUH. Conclusions: Analyses revealed significant differences in the pharmacotherapy of first episode psychosis at the NERH and the TUH. Mechanisms to facilitate improved adherence to the evidence-based treatment guidelines should be investigated. 1 Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Getafe, Spain",

A case can be made for combining grade 1-3 compliance with respect to appendectomy, resulting in a higher compliance rate. Conclusions: Our proposed method to measure compliance needs to be validated by future research. The method can be applied to different surgical procedures, thereby stimulating surgeons to explain differences in compliance between procedures and promoting the development of instruments to enhance compliance. Closer interaction with surgeons is required to further develop the measurement of compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis.

Design: Retrospective study of neonatal patients diagnosed with immune thrombopenia during 2006 and treated with non-specific human immunoglobulins. A revision of clinical histories is made and following data are collected: sex, gestational age, born weight, age at the moment of infusion, administered dose and duration of treatment, use of corticoids and platelet transfusions, number of platelets/lL before infusion, at 24, at 48 hours of initiate the treatment and at discharge. Possible adverse reactions is also considered. Setting: Hospital Universitario de Getafe. Main Outcome Measures: The effectiveness and safety of nonspecific human immunoglobulins for treatment of immune neonatal thrombopenia. Results: Three children were included in the study, two of them were males. Thrombopenia was diagnosed from probable alloimmune origin, including positive confirmation study in one of the cases. Gestational ages ranged from 38 + 2 to 39 + 1 weeks. Born weight ranged between 1.850 kg and 2.720 kg. Immunoglobulin treatment was initiated between first and sixth day of life. Administered dose varies between 400 mg/kg/day and 1 g/kg/day from two to five days. All children needed platelet transfusions, while only one of them was treated with corticoids. The number of platelets/lL before infusion of immunoglobulins, at 24 hours, at 48 hours and at discharge was: children 1: 41,000, 23,000, 81,000 and 116,000 platelets/lL. Children 2: 34,000, 22,000, 18,000 and 303,000. Children 3: 19,000 and 25,000 platelets/lL 24 hours after initiation of treatment, there were no analytical data at 48 hours, but number of platelets at discharge was 355,000. No adverse effects were observed in any children. Conclusions: Although eventually the three children recovered the number of platelets, it can not be concluded that this was due to immunoglobulin treatment, because it is overlapped with administration of platelet transfusions and corticoids. A higher number of patients is required to evaluate efficacy and safety of non-specific human immunoglobulins in treatment of neonatal thrombopenia. Background and Objective: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is one of the most difficult childhood disease to treat. In Spain, oral sildenafil has recently been approved in adults to treat PH, but it 0 s an off-label drug for children (its utilization must be derived to ''compassionate use'', which requires a prior National Health Authorities approval for every children), and an oral suspension must be formulated at the pharmacy department for them. The objective of this study is to analyse the use of oral sildenafil for PH in paediatric patients. Design: 4 years retrospective study. 100% paediatrics patients with oral sildenafil for PH. Clinical data review. Setting: Paediatric Cardiology Unit and Pharmacy Department (1 pharmacist) in a paediatric hospital (300 beds), in a large general teaching hospital (1450 beds, 15 pharmacists). Main Outcome Measures: Patient data (diagnosis, age, weight). Treatment description (dose, length of treatment). Treatment effectiveness: peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and six-minute walk test. Treatment security: side effects registered. Results: 15 children (8 girls). Age: 3 months to 17 years, median 7.3 years. Diagnosis: 13/15 PH secondary to surgery due to congenital heart disease and 2/15 primary PH.",

Background and Objective: We will describe the case of a bi-pulmonary transplant women who developed an invasive aspergillosis located in the lungs and the brain. She received intravenous voriconazole during 14 days. She was then diagnosed with an Aspergillus endophthalmitis. Even though a dual therapy consisting of caspofungin and posaconazole was initiated, the patient underwent a partial vitrectomy. This therapeutic failure could be explained by a late diagnosis and insufficient vitreous and aqueous humor penetration of the systemic drugs. Design: A retrospective analysis of an endophthalmitis management. Setting: Clinical Unit in a French Teaching hospital Main Outcome Measures: To secure a high ocular concentration, the ophtalmologist recommended voriconazole intravitreal injections. His prescription was based on several case reports. Results: We found articles dealing with animal testing: one concluded that voriconazole was a safe intravitreal agent which may be injected in human eye. Another study described the successfull use of intra-ocular voriconazole to treat a fungal endophthalmitis: it allowed a significant improvement in visual acuity and the patient's recovery. However, further studies are needed to assess the optimal dosage and frequency of administration. We prepared voriconazole syringes under a horizontal laminar air flow hood, as follows:",

            "text": "Background and Objective: In 2003 professionals were alerted about an elevated frequency of early virological failure in patients treated with tenofovir (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) associated to lamivudine. In 2005 similar results related to the administration of TDF and ddI, in association with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) were notified. Therefore similar events can be observed when TDF and ddI are co-administered in combination with other antiretroviral classes, such as protease inhibitors (PI). Subsequent pharmacokinetic studies have shown that TDF when co-administered with ddI increases ddI plasma concentrations leves by up to 40-60%, with a higher risk of didanosine-related adverse events, like pancreatitis and lactic acidosis. The administration of a reduced dose of didanosine (250 mg) to avoid over-exposure to didanosine may also contribute to a higher rate of virological failure and emergence of resistance at early stage. The objective of the study is to asses the rate of virological failure in patients treated with TDF and ddI associated to a PI. Results: During the study period 27 patients had prescription for drotrecogin alfa for sepsis syndrome; 48.1% were male and the mean age was 58.7 years (range 16-83 years). All patients had proven infection: 66.7% had pneumonia (n = 18), 22.2% pyelonephritis(n = 6), 3.7% soft tissue infection(n = 1) and 7.4% abdominal infection(n = 2). The main isolated micro-organisms were Klebsiella pneumonia(n = 3), Escherichia coli(n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa(n = 1), Enterococcus faecium(n = 1), Staphylococcus aureus(n = 2), Legionella pneumophila(n = 1), Proteus vulgaris(n = 1), Enterococcus faecium(n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca(n = 1). All patients started treatment within 24 h of the onset of severe sepsis. The treatment was not completed in one patient due to adverse events. Contraindications were present in 4 patients: platelet count \\30.000 9 106/L (n = 2), age under 18 years (n = 1) and major surgery (n = 1). The mean organ failures was 3.5 (range 2-5 organs). Adverse reactions were present in 7 patients: thrombocytopenia (n = 3), pancytopenia (n = 1), bleeding (n = 1) and elevation of activated partial thromboplastin time (n = 1). Mortality at 28 days was found to be 37% (n = 10). Conclusions: Despite the presence of some contraindications, in most patients drotrecogin alfa was used according to current guidelines. Nevertheless, since APACHE II score was not determined, the real risk of death is unknown and there can be no extrapolation to literature results. Upon these findings, a systematic evaluation of APACHE II score must be implemented in order to optimize patient selection and the risk-benefit ratio, improving the use of drotrecogin alfa. 1 Pharmacy, 2 Oncology, H\u00f4pital Tenon APHP, Paris, France Background and Objective: It is necessary to focus on side effects for pharmaceutical analysis.

Medication profile and laboratory data are accessible online by clinical pharmacists. The project was conducted in order to optimise pharmacotherapy in patients with renal impairment and to integrate the clinical pharmacist in the therapeutic team. Setting: Unit-dose supplied wards (n = 73) in four Asklepios hopitals in Hamburg with approximately 1800 patients per day. The project was conducted in cooperation with clinical pharmacists, physicians and the laboratory department over a period of 2.5 months (12/06-02/07). Programm description: Clinical pharmacists receive a list of all patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\ 30 mL/ min/1,73 m 2 (MDRD) from the laboratory department on a daily basis. They screen medication profiles daily with regard to apparently inappropriate dosing of renally excreted drugs (Q o \\ 0.5). Critical cases are reported to physicians by phone or entry in medical case notes. Following an interdisciplinary discussion with the physician the drug dose or dosing interval is either adjusted, the medication is stopped or paused or an alternative is started. During the pilot phase the number of altered medications as a result of pharmacists' recommendations was documented. Results: A prevalence of 5% of patients with a eGFR \\ 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 was found in the examined setting. During the pilot phase 1088 of 5013 prescribed drugs (21%) were renally excreted or considered nephrotoxic. Antibiotics (26%), antidiabetics (7%), diuretics (25%) or NSAIs (11%) were predominantly involved. Overall, 225 of 318 pharmaceutical recommendations (71%) were accepted and acted upon by physicians. Conclusion: The number of recommendations demonstrates the importance of this service in optimising pharmacotherapy. Clinical pharmacists' contributions in matters of dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is well received by physicians especially in non-nephrologic departments. The new service was found to be feasible in daily practice and has become part of the clinical routine. Background and Objective: The sources and availability of drug information for patients are growing, e.g. through the internet and official patient information leaflets (PILs). However, the quality of the information on the internet might be questioned. Furthermore, PILs are not standardized, the layout is not reader friendly and the information covers all approved indications for the drug, some of them not relevant for rheumatic patients. Also, over the years various information leaflets for drugs have been developed in the departments of rheumatology in Norway. These are not standardized and the accessibility is limited.",

Setting: Three daily drug distribution units working for six hospitalization departments (92 beds for orthopaedic and vascular surgeries and 102 for internal medicine, pneumology and endocrinology). Main Outcome Measures: Percentage of interventions and of each type (7) based on analysed lines. Results -More interventions in surgery than in medicine: 435 and 190 i.e. 14.10% vs 6.55% (p \\ 0.005). Most interventions are substitutions: 60% of all interventions in surgery, 40% in medicine. -More clinical and biological monitoring in surgery (1.04% vs 0.24%, p \\ 0.005), mainly monitoring for heparin and kaliemia. -More pharmacokinetics advice in surgery (1.44% vs 0.62%, p \\ 0.005), for example: iron and quinolones. -More dosage adaptations in surgery (0.50% vs 0.14%, p \\ 0.005), for example: paracetamol and buflomedil overdosages. -Better acceptance in medicine than in surgery: 70% of all interventions vs 41%. Conclusions: The presence of a pharmacist in surgical and medical wards is justified by the number and relevance of pharmaceutical interventions, even though the acceptance remains insufficient in surgery because of the problem of surgeons availability.

Main Outcome Measures: Correct knowledge and appropriate use of the CPOE nurse module were analysed thanks to questions and remarks of the members of the working group.Results: It appeared that uncorrect use of the CPOE nurse module caused dysfunctions. Because some dysfunctions repeated several times (uncorrect ordering support, uncorrect reading of dosage units, registration of infusion settings\u2026), it appeared necessary to compile a document named ''Good practices for the use of CPOE nurse module''. This document pointed out several stages to be respected from prescription of a treatment to validation of its administration: 11 points, including, amongst others, checking of the ordering support documents, dosage units, methods of administration, \u2026 were then diffused to each head nurse of computerized units. Conclusions: This working method made it possible to highlight the central role of our drug commission and the transverse role of its working groups, the exhaustiveness of analysis in collecting difficulties of use of a common software. The created document succeeded in helping nurses to solve the main dysfunctions. Additional working subgroups could be created to analyse each other stage of the drug circuit (orders, protocols, safeguards, patient files, etc\u2026), to carry out the study of its development and to take part in its appraisal.Keywords: Drug commission, Drug circuit, CPOE, Good practices PC-40 Analysis of the activity in a dispensing unit aimed to external patients Elvira Gea 1 , Maria Dolores Garc\u00eda 1 , Esperanza Gil 1 , Nuria Barral 1 1 Pharmacy Department, Nostra Senyora de Meritxell, Escaldes-Engordany, Andorra Background and Objective: Analyse the evolution of the supporting activity and the economic impact of the dispensed medicines in a unit of pharmaceutical attention to external patients (UPAEP). Design: Observational and retrospective study during three years (2004-2006) carried out in a UPAEP. Setting: UPAEP. 200 bedded hospital that covers all the country's population (84.000 inhabitants). Main Outcome Measures:\u2022 The measurement unit for the supporting activity is: number of patients assisted. The descriptive study has been carried out by pathology and per year. \u2022 The economic impact has been worked out based on the medicines consumption of each treated pathology applying the retail price. This has been related to the total consumption of the unit per year.Results: Number total of patients in 2004:165, 2005:208, 2006:207. Classification by pathology and per year: 2004: Chronic Kidney Failure (CKF): 44 patients (26.6%), others: 32 (19.4%), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): 27 (16.4%), Conclusions -The UPAEP undergoes a growth (25%) in total supporting activity in 2005 which stables in 2006. -The growth in the supporting activity of RI and CKF is paralleled to the growth in the economic cost. -Decrease the economic cost in MS because of a decrease in medicines' retail prices. -The economic variations occurred in HIV is due to the treatment changes.

Information fact sheet was sent to all physicians about guideline's recall. In 2006 a second prospective study was designed with aim to evaluate the impact of this information fact sheet. Design: The Acetaminophen IV consumption expressed on days of treatment was studied. Questionnaire was designed to record data on patient to which IVA was prescribed. Items were: Clinical indication, opportunity of an oral route, criteria of choice for the route of injection, prevalence of peripheral route in comparison to central administration, presence of an electric syringe if central route is chosen. Pharmacy students were asked to fulfil the questionnaire during two weeks. Setting: Sixteen clinical units in a large teaching hospital (2000 beds) were prospected. Main Outcome Measures: Prescriptions of Acetaminophen IV: number, oral intake opportunity. Results: 46 prescriptions were analyzed and 145 administrations were recorded. No decrease of Acetaminophen IV consumption values were observed in comparison to 2005 study. In 65% of IVA prescriptions, oral route was possible vs 44% in 2005. 20% of cases were in clinical trials. The main reason to choose IV administration was the presence of another infusion prescription (33% vs 48%). Only 13% of infusion intake switched to oral intake before the end of treatment.

Since only few clinical pharmacists are available and clinical pharmacy practices are not routinely performed in hospitals in Turkey, most of the physicians are not familiar with clinical pharmacy practices. Design: Descriptive study for clinical pharmacist's activities in ICU during the period of December 2001 and May 2002 (89 working days). Data were recorded daily about the clinical pharmacist's interventions and the questions from other health care professionals answered during the ward round. The clinical pharmacist visited ICU almost all week-days and was available on call when needed. Setting: Nine-bed medical intensive care unit at the Hacettepe University Hospital in Ankara, Turkey. Main Outcome Measures: Number of the clinical pharmacist's interventions accepted by the physicians and types of drug related problems that requires clinical pharmacist's interventions were the main outcomes. Results: Total of 297 interventions were made and a total of 40 questions were answered by the clinical pharmacist. Only 36 (%12) of the interventions were not accepted by physicians. Majority of the interventions were related with therapeutic drug level monitoring (44.4%) and dosage adjustment in renal failure (22.6%). Furthermore, the clinical pharmacist provided three educational seminars on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to the physicians during study period. Conclusions: ICU patients routinely receive more therapies than the patients on a general medical or surgical ward, so it will be a good place to start for the implementation of the clinical pharmacy in hospital setting. Clinical pharmacist could have a significant impact in improving patient care and providing optimum therapy in ICU by implementation of clinical pharmacy services and being active member of the health care team. Keywords: Clinical pharmacy, Objective: Medication errors most commonly occur at the prescribing stage. Prescriptions are often not written according to the regulations. The retranscriptions of the original prescriptions by nurses are also source of errors. The aim of the study was to access the conformity of prescriptions and their retranscriptions. Design: A retrospective study was conducted in 3 wards, one day given in May 2006. Setting: 3 wards (internal medicine, infectiology and week hospital) with 70 beds in Reims University hospital. Main Outcome Measures: In the one hand, we have assessed if all regulation's variables were present on prescriptions. These variables were related to the prescribers (name, signature quality), the prescriptions (date, hour, ward), the patients (name, surname, age, weight and height) and drugs (readable, International Non-proprietary Name (INN), dosage, pharmaceutical form, dosage of unit, administration route and hour).

Main Outcome Measures: The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling Adequacy for suitability of factor analysis and cronbach's coefficient alpha values for the internal consistency reliability tests to establish final domains of the SEIP and their components. Results: Three-factor models were produced: 1) the impacts of statins on healthcare services use; 2) emotional distress and impacts on productivity; and 3) socio-emotional symptoms and use of healthcare services. The correlation matrix for SEIP revealed the presence of some coefficients of 0.3 and above (KMO value was 0.82) therefore confirming the suitability of the SEIP data set for factor analysis. The alpha coefficients for internal reliability ranged between 0.62-0.77. Conclusions: The factor analysis results have clearly supported the clinical and statistical meaningfulness of the SEIP domains.

The aim of this work is to validate a quality of life in adult hypertensive patients scale -Hypertension Health Status Inventory (Hyper). Design: Patients over 18 years old and with a history of antihypertensive treatment for at least 6 months were invited at the pharmacy to complete the 45 items version of the original Hyper, the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) as well as a sociodemografic questionnaire. The scales were self administered or filled by the pharmacist when necessary. Setting: A sample of 1512 subjects was gathered in over 300 Portuguese Community Pharmacies were involved in the study following the previously defined criteria. Main Outcome Measures: Validity of the Hyper was evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (principal axis factoring with varimax and promax rotation). Depressive and anxiety symptoms being important components of quality of life, concurrent validity was evaluated using BDI-II and BAI. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach 0 s alpha and item remainder correlations. Results: After factoring the 45 items of the Hyper, 27 items were retained using as criteria salient loadings[.30. Further analysis were performed on 27 items of 1512 questionnaires showing a two factor structure labelled Emotion/Physical (15 items) and Daily (12 items). Cronbach 0 s alpha for the subscales was .87 and .76 respectively. Item remainder correlations for Emotional/Physical subscale have a maximum and a minimum value of .71 and .30 respectively with a median value of .59. Values of .60, .27 and .39 were found for the Daily subscale.Concurrent validity: Correlations with BDI-II and BAI were -.68 and -.65.No significant correlations between Emotion/Physical and Daily Hyper27 subscales and blood pressure, duration of hypertension after diagnosis where found.No significantly differences in mean values on Hyper 27 total and subscales scores of controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure of hypertensive patients where found. Conclusions: The final version of Hyper (27 items) has good construct and concurrent validity as well as good internal consistency. In Portuguese language Hyper 27 seems to be a promising scale in the evaluation of a chronic disease-related quality of life, which is becoming an increasingly important goal for health professionals.Keywords: Quality of life, Community pharmacy, Hypertension, Hyper 27 PEPI-264 Proton pomp inhibitor (PPI) prescription in a medicine unit of a university hospital: indications and part of off-label use Emmanuel Gasperi 1 , Philippe Mougenot 1 , Medicine, Chu Bichat-Claude Bernard AP-HP, Paris, France Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse the indication of PPI prescription during hospitalization to determinate the part of off-label use in a department of internal medicine.

Intervention is defined as a session of oral and written sanitary education distributed by the pharmacist about the medicines that the patient uses and its problem of health. The analysis of the information obtained has been made by a comparison of average for related samples. Setting: Two community pharmacies with similar characteristics in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain Main Outcome Measures: Knowledge of medicines and health problem before and alter the sanitary education. Results: Sixteen patients were included in the study, where 8 were women. 3 patients did not want to collaborate but they did not show any different characteristics. Regarding the independent variables of participants, the average age was of 68 years (min 40, max 81). 13 of the 16 patients did not have studies or had primary studies. The average of oral antidiabetics taken by patient was of 2. The total number of oral antidiabetics studied was of 25. Before the intervention, the level of knowledge of the oral antidiabetics was as follows: optimal knowledge 17, tolerable knowledge 1 and insufficient knowledge 8. After the session of sanitary education about all the oral antidiabetics studied the knowledge of them became optimal. Concerning the knowledge of the diabetes before the intervention, it was as follows: optimal knowledge for 7 patients, tolerable in 1 patient and 8 patients had an insufficient knowledge. After the sanitary education, 3 patients remained with an insufficient knowledge on the diabetes and all the rest obtained an optimal knowledge.Conclusions: The sanitary education distributed by the pharmacist improves the knowledge in patients of the oral antidiabetics and of the diabetes itself. Although the study population is not very significant, this research could open a line of investigation in sanitary education and in the knowledge of medicines and health problems.

For patients whose medication was changed, FPG decreased significantly more in patients of the intervention group, compared with patients of the control group (I: -32.1 mg/dl; C: -12.8 mg/dl) (p = 0.022). These results suggest that a joint action of general practitioner and pharmacist has the largest impact on glycaemia.

Clinical pharmacist reviews medication order lists and in the context of individual patients data and identify drug related problems (DRPs). The first research of pharmacist's interventions for EC General surgery inpatients in Serbia has shown that DRPs are frequent and that drug choice is the most common problem identified, antibiotics most often involved. Clinical pharmacist should promote responsible, safe and rational drugs use.Background and Objective: Policies provide consistency and basis for standardisation of professional services. The policies should be regularly reviewed to reflect the requirements of the ever changing healthcare settings. The aim was to validate pharmacy policies and identify required amendments.Design: Four pharmacy policies were identified: Dispensing of Medications for Patients Admitted on the Wards (DMA), Dispensing of Medications for Discharged Patients (DMD), Amendments in Medications (AM) and Checking of the Emergency Trolley (ET).Tools were developed to validate the policies. The investigator used the tools and observed the procedure followed when dispensing medications to patients admitted on the wards, dispensing medications to discharged patients and changing medications to hospitalized patients for thirty times. The procedure followed when checking the emergency trolley was observed for eighteen times. Twenty-eight out of 55 nurses practising at the hospital were interviewed about their knowledge on the ET policy. Setting: Zammit Clapp Hospital, St Julians, a 60-bed acute geriatric hospital where a unit-dose dispensing system is adopted. Main Outcome Measures: Pharmacists' compliance with the policies, nurses' compliance with the ET policy, nurses' knowledge on the ET policy. Results: Pharmacists showed full compliance with the DMD, AM and ET policies. Pharmacists failed to comply with two steps of the DMA policy. The overall compliance achieved with DMA policy was 92%. Pharmacists showed a 67% compliance with the step requiring checking of drug interactions and 93% compliance with the step requiring checking for other drug-related problems. In addition a step that is included in the DMA policy where the doctors contact pharmacists to inform them of the new admission to prepare required drugs showed an 83% non-compliance. From the study it transpired that the steps required to be carried out by nurses for the ET policy were not being followed. The mean nurses' knowledge about the ET policy was 72% with a range of 51-91%. Documentation of the checking of the emergency trolley was missing. Conclusions: Following this study, the policy on Checking of the Emergency Trolley was amended and implemented. The steps which showed low compliance in the other policies were discussed with the pharmacy personnel to emphasise requirements of the policies.

            "text": "A French acute university hospital of 950 beds. Main Outcome Measures: Prescription and dispensation errors, checked by our pharmacy department, were defined according to a potential clinical severity scale elaborate by the pharmacist of the clinical trials unit. This scale defined 4 groups of severity according to the clinical risk for the patient and to the protocol's set of rules: with the group A (severe errors with the possibility of the exclusion of the patient), group B (potentially serious errors), group C (potentially significant errors), and the group D, with missing information on the prescription without consequence for the patient and the compliance of the study protocol. Results: 2312 orders were analysed concerning 67 ongoing clinical trials. We found one error per order on average (2315/2312) and the most frequent errors were name omission 44% (1011/2315), signature omission 15% (355/2315) and the wrong prescription-writing 11%.(264/2315). On the prescriptor part, 0.37 (856/2312) errors per order were detected and 1% of them (12/856) would have severe consequences (group A), mainly related to the wrong treatment number or the wrong protocol. Concerning the dispensing part, 0.63 (1459/2312) errors per order were detected and 0.54% (8/1459) of them were classified in group A. Those errors were mainly related to the wrong treatment dispensing to the patient in a blink study or missing dispensing drug. Conclusions: Among these errors, 0.8% would cause the exclusion of the patient. Even if the majority of these errors (67.8%) have no consequences (group D), such as biased results, most of them are avoidable with a regular information of the investigators meeting prior to trial start. Regular evaluation of internships and technicians and specific computerized software could also improve the working clinical practices for an optimal organization in conducting clinical trials.Keywords: Clinical trials, Prescription, Dispensation EDU-107 The role of the university of khartoum towards the implementation of pharmaceutical care practice in Sudan Sumia Sir Elkhatim Mohamed 1 Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan Background and Objective: Sudan, the largest country in Africa, has 12 Faculties of Pharmacy (4 governmental and 8 private). The awareness of the new role of the pharmacist; pharmaceutical care practice (PCP) was investigated. This new role, which is different from the traditional current role of dispensing is not yet implemented in Sudan. The University of Khartoum, the oldest and largest University in the country, assumed responsibility of changing this. The aim is: a) To describe the attempts of the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum in paving the way for patient-focused teaching and training. b) To show the efforts exerted towards the transition in pharmacy practice that must occur to establish PC in both community and hospital settings in Sudan.Design: A descriptive study using Face to Face interviews, Structured questionnaires and Steering Committees and experts' views and opinions to provide data on current situation of pharmacy teaching and practice in Sudan and possible future changes. Setting: University of Khartoum, Soba Hospital and community pharmacies in Khartoum. Main Outcome Measures: Public and pharmacists awareness of PCP, assessment of current pharmacy undergraduate curriculum, the efforts and means provided to change to Patient-centered teaching and training and to raise the attention of the authorities towards the implementation of PCP in Sudan. Results: Public awareness of PCP is very low. While awareness among pharmacists is high, they lack appropriate training on use of their knowledge, skills and attitudes. Number of pharmacy hours taught in 4 years is 3960; 1680 hours theory (42.4%) and 2280 hours practical (57.6%). Although some sporadic clinical aspects are taught, the teaching and practical training are mainly product-focused. Development of the curriculum has been recommended to provide an educational programme that will appropriately address contemporary and foreseeable future changes in the practice of pharmacy. This needs appropriate trainers and modern pharmacies. The Faculty of Pharmacy established a two years postgraduate degree in clinical pharmacy by courses in 2004 and started the refurbishment of the Pharmacy at Soba Hospital to pave the way for implementation of clinical pharmacy teaching and training and the introduction of clinical pharmacy services at hospital setting and in-service training. Master and PhD degrees by research are currently in progress investigating the possibility of implementing PCP at community setting using different models. Plans for future collaboration with regulatory authorities and the role of Leadership were envisaged. Conclusions: Pharmacy curricula need to be revised to accommodate the concepts of clinical pharmacy. The intention is to provide means to inform the authorities and debate in the process of establishing acceptable standards for PCP in Sudan. The role of the regularity authorities and the leadership must be activated.Keywords: Clinical pharmacy, Pharmaceutical care practice, Sudan EDU-121 To modify the behaviour: who does it matter?

Many people find it difficult because it means deep and wide life change. But how patients can modify lifestyle if health care professionals don't modify first their attitude towards patients? The Hypertension Working Group of Cardarelli Hospital of Naples, Italy in the view of ''transferring'' ''Dieciannidivitainpi\u00f9'' (life ten years longer) from the hospital to the community, made a survey whose aim was to determine the meaning that General Practitioners (GPs) ascribe to the patient-centred approach and to identify the important concepts and issues inherent to this approach. ''Dieciannidivitainpi\u00f9'' is an educational programme aimed at reducing blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension through a lifestyle modification, and it has got its preliminary positive results. Design: qualitative survey. Setting: General Practitioners' cooperatives of Benevento's community.

            "text": "Pharmacy, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, BelgiumBackground and Objective: Tacrolimus is widely used as a potent immunosuppressive agent. However, it has a small therapeutic window and toxic levels are possibly leading to severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and QT prolongation. Tacrolimus is nearly completely metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4; drug interactions are hence expected with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Design: Case report. Setting: Medical Intensive Care Unit. Main Outcome Measures: Toxic tacrolimus levels after administration of a single dose of clarithromycin. Results: A 22-year old woman with a medical history of heartlungtransplantation for multiple major aortic pulmonary collateral arteries, was admitted with fever and progressive dyspnea. Her immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus (5-4 mg PO) and methylprednisolone 4 mg PO. Meropenem was started empirically to treat pneumonia. On day 3, the patient was transferred to the ICU because of progressive respiratory insufficiency, where she was immediately intubated. Ganciclovir and SMX-TMP were associated to cover possible opportunistic infections by CMV and Pneumocystis jiroveci. Clarithromycin 500 mg BD IV was also associated, because Legionella pneumoniae as causative agent was not yet ruled out. However, Legionella antigen was negative and treatment could be stopped after administration of a single dose of clarithromycin. Tacrolimus (0.5 mg/24u IV) was daily monitored, trough level was 14 lg/L on day 3 after admission but increased on day 4 up to 24 lg/ L after association of clarithromycin. Concomitant treatment on day 4 was azathioprine, methylprednisolone, meropenem, ganciclovir, SMX-TMP, piritramide and midazolam. We believe that clarithromycin is the causative agent leading to toxic levels as the timerelationship between administration and toxic levels is clear. Other causative factors could be ruled out: no other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors were administered and renal function did not change (serum creatinine 0.84 (day3) and 0.64 mg/dL (day4). We calculated the DIPS score, which assesses the causation of potential drug interactions, and concluded that the interaction is at least probable.1 A Medline search revealed other case reports describing the same interaction in renal, bone marrow and heart transplant patients.2,3,4,5 Clarithromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, leading to competitive inhibition and toxic levels of tacrolimus. It is remarkable that even one single dose of clarithromycin results in plasma concentrations that are capable of blocking CYP3A4. In this patient, the interaction did not have clinical consequences. Conclusions: This case illustrates that even one single dose of clarithromycin can lead to toxic tacrolimus levels. We believe that other antibiotics, such as azithromycin or fluoroquinolones, should be used if patients on tacrolimus have to be treated for Legionella pneumoniae. These drugs do not have the potential to interact with tacrolimus.PK-209 Pharmacokinetics of oral taurine in healthy volunteers Mohammadreza Ghandforoush-Sattari 1 , Siminozar Mashayekhi 2 Pharmacology and Toxicology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, 2 Clinical Pharmacy, Iran (Islamic Republic of) Background and Objective: Taurine is a relatively non-toxic substance and a normal constituent of the human diet. Protective effects of taurine on cells against different toxic agents have already been established. Little is known of the pharmacokinetics of taurine in man after oral administration. Design: Eight healthy male volunteers (median age 27.5, range 22-45) were recruited from the general population. Taurine 4 g was administered orally to each volunteer in the fasting state in the morning. Setting: The study was performed in the Cardiff Poisons Unit, Llandough Hospital, Cardiff, Wales, UK. Main Outcome Measures: Blood samples were taken (3 ml each time) at regular intervals and Plasma taurine concentration was measured by a modified HPLC method. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by WinNonlin (Version 1.5) software package. Results: Maximum plasma taurine concentration (Cmax) was 86.1 \u00b1 19.0 mg/L, time of maximum concentration (Tmax) between 1 and 2.5 hours (1.5 \u00b1 0.6 hr), plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 hr, and the ratio of clearance/bioavailability (Cl/F) was 21.1 \u00b1 7.8 L/hr. Conclusions: All pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly different from the only one previous study which was studied following an IV injection of 200 mg bolus dose on six hypertensive human patients and six healthy volunteers. This was probably because they were examining an alpha phase which was obscured by the absorption phase for taurine after oral absorption.

Coadministration of ITRA with PIs may lead to serious drug-drug interaction (DDI) by increasing ITRA concentration because of CYP3A4 inhibition properties of PIs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PIs on ITRA metabolism in a Chinese hamster V79-derived cell line, stably expressing human CYP3A4.Design: Studies monitoring CYP3A4-mediated ITRA metabolite formation with time, in the presence of increasing concentrations of each PI were used to obtain in vitro Ki values. Kinetic parameters of ITRA hydroxylation were determined by incubating for 3 h at 37\u00b0C the V79 cells in 6-well plates in 1 mL of complete culture medium containing increasing concentrations of ITRA (0.14 to 3.5 lM) with or without PIs. ITRA metabolite (hydroxy-itraconazole) concentrations in culture medium were measured using validated reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with fluorescence detector. Setting: Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Henri Mondor Hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Enzyme inhibition by PIs (Ki) were estimated using a non linear least square regression with proportional weighting (1/v2) with SigmaPlot \u00d2 Enzyme Kinetics Module. The data were fitted using conventional relationships for competitive, noncompetitive or mixed-type inhibition. Results: Lopinavir, indinavir PIs used at maximal plasma concentrations inhibit ITRA hydroxylation competitively for lopinavir, indinavir, amprenavir with a Ki values of 0.37, 0.54 and 0.66 lM, respectively, non-competitively for ritonavir, saquinavir, atazanavir and tipranavir with a Ki value of 0.31, 3.3, 1.10 and 32.1 lM, respectively and with a mixed-type inhibition mechanism for nelfinavir, with apparent Ki equal to 2.4 lM. All PIs, except saquinavir, are expected to inhibit in vivo ITRA hydroxylation with predicted inhibition percentage from 74.4% for atazanavir to 98% for ritonavir. Conclusions: In clinical settings, this suggests obvious potential of significant DDI for all of the PIs, except for nelfinavir which is also metabolized by others CYP450. Finally, a close therapeutic drug monitoring of ITRA plasma concentrations for these patients is recommended.Keywords: CYP3A4, Protease inhibitor, Drug interaction PK-293 Prevention of chemotherapy related errors one step toward Catarina Oliveira 1 , Filipa Duarte-Ramos 1 , Jos\u00e9 Cabrita 1 Social-Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, PortugalBackground and Objective: Several strategies have been proposed to minimize cytotoxic medication errors.

Secondary endpoints included comparisons of pain scores, sedation scores, and adverse effects between the two groups. Design: Prospective observational study design. Patient's C18 years of age that were scheduled for elective total knee arthroplasty between October 2005 and June 2007 were included in the study. Patients were classified into one of two categories based on their daily opioid consumption during the week prior to surgery; 1) opioid na\u00efve (B10 mg of oral morphine equivalent); 2) opioid tolerant (C30 mg of oral morphine equivalent). Setting: Academic medical center in the United States. Main Outcome Measures: Post-operative opioid consumption, pain scores and sedation scores were compared between the two groups during three different time periods: 1) Time in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), 2) 24 hours after discharge from the PACU and 3) 24-48 hours after discharge from the PACU. Results: A total of 29 patients satisfied criteria for inclusion into the study (20 opioid na\u00efve, 9 opioid tolerant). Post-operative opioid consumption (intravenous morphine equivalent) was significantly greater in the opioid tolerant group in the PACU (median 56 vs. 8.2 mg, p = 0.0013); during the first 24 hours after discharge from the PACU (108 vs. 20.5 mg, p = 0.0004) and 24 to 48 hours after discharge from the PACU (152.3 vs. 25 mg, p = 0.0001). Pain scores (verbal numeric scale from 0-10) were significantly greater in the opioid tolerant group during the first 24 hours after discharge from the PACU (5.9 vs. 4.1, p = 0.03). There was no difference in pain scores during the other time periods studied. Sedation scores and adverse effects were similar between the groups during the study. Conclusions: Opioid tolerant patients have significantly greater opioid requirements in the PACU and up to 48 hours after discharge from the PACU compared to opioid na\u00efve patients after orthopedic surgery.Keywords: Pain, Opioid, Surgery PT-26 Evaluation of the compliance of clinical practice with approved prescription information for Rituximab Mari Carmen Conde 1 , Beatriz Garcia 1 , Jaime Vargas 1 , Maria Amalia Fernandez 1 Pharmacy, Cytostatic Unit CCU, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain Background and Objective: To evaluate the compliance of clinical practice with conditions of use in the Prescription Information Sheet in relation to the utilization of Rituximab between July 1 2006 and December 31 2006. Design: Prospective, observational, single-centre study of all patients who started treatment with Rituximab at the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital between July 1 2006 and December 31 2006, with follow-up to April 30 2007. Setting: Department of Pharmacy Cytostatic Unit and Medical Departments of Oncology, Rheumatology, Internal Medicine and Day-Hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Degree of compliance of clinical practice with the indications, regimen, line of treatment, dose, and frequency and number of courses established in the Prescription Information Sheet.Results: Out of the 31 treated patients, 7 (23%) received Rituximab for a disease not included in the Prescription Information Sheet, i.e., in practically a quarter of cases, approval is required for compassionate use. Only 65% of the drug regimens accorded with the Prescription Information Sheet. Among the patients receiving Rituximab for an approved indication and with an appropriate regimen, the correct dose and treatment line were used in 100% of cases, whereas recommendations for the frequency and number of courses were only followed in 86% and 42% of cases, respectively. Conclusions: A very high proportion of patients are being treated with Rituximab for an indication that is not approved in the Prescription Information Sheet, meaning that there are no conclusive data on the efficacy and safety of this drug in these cases. Indications for Rituximab treatment were completely followed in only four (12.9%) of the patients in this sample.PT-43 Clinical pharmacist intervention in nephrology ward in an Iranian academic health center Talia Mazidi 1 , Simin Dashti Khavidaki 1 , Hossein Khalili 1 Clinical Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (Islamic Republic of)Background and Objective: Patients with chronic kidney disease have several complications which necessitate drug therapy. Because of polypharmacy in this population, risk of drug interactions and adverse drug effects (ADEs) will increase. It is established that clinical pharmacist have critical role in the treatment safety and reducing healthcare cost by monitoring patients for ADEs, appropriate dose and rational drug administration and identification of prescription errors. So we decided to evaluate the impact of pharmacist intervention in drug safety in our hospital. Design: During an ongoing activity in an academic nephrology ward, we have visited 61 patients till now and did some interventions for the first 2 months. Interventions were about dose adjustment, adverse effects alert, drug interactions, IV to PO conversion, drug information, drug administration,\u2026 Setting: Nephrology Ward in Imam Referral Hospital affiliated to Tehran University, Tehran, Iran. Main Outcome Measures: For treatment monitoring we have used NKF/DOQI guidelines in chronic kidney disease: Hg = 11-12, Hct = 33-36%, Ca-P \\ 55, 2.5 \\ P \\ 5.5. Results: We did 1.2 intervention per patient during this time. Among these patients, 11.4% needed treatment interchange (drug replacement), 9.8% drug discontinuation, 29.5% dose adjustment, 6.6% IV to PO conversion, 32.8% recommendation about drug administration, 11.4% adding a drug to previous order, 4.9% ADEs alert, 21.3% monitoring for drug interactions and in 3.3% of cases there was a prescription error. Conclusions: As it is clear, by clinical pharmacist interventions, in addition to giving better healthcare services, reducing healthcare cost will be achievable as well.Canadell Laura 1 , Pardo Rocio 1 , Aviles Francisco J 2 , Ca\u00f1 ete Carmen 1 , Figuerola Enric 2 , Gallart M Jesus 1 Pharmacy service, 2 Otorhinolaryngology, Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain Background and Objective: To evaluate the use of topical mitomycin 0.02% used as an adjunct to choanal atresia surgical repair to reduce the development of granulation tissue and cicatrix.

Conclusions: These results suggest that Rituximab is an effective treatment in patients affected by RA refractory to 2 or more current anti-TNF. Although patients did not realise this improvement, the decrease in DAS makes Rituximab an interesting option in this type of patients. However a higher number of patients is required to confirm these results.

Tacoronte 1 , Yolanda Larrubia 1 , Esperanza Jimenez 1 Pharmacy, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain Background and Objective: Effectiveness of infliximab and rituximab in a patient diagnosed of refractory dermatomyositis (DM). The idiopatic inflammatory myopathies constitute a group of disorders characterized by muscle weakness, increased of muscle enzymes levels, dermatologic features and abnormalities found in muscle biopsy and electromyography. Most patients respond to corticosteroids. Design: Retrospective study of a case of refractory dermatomyositis. Setting: Rheumathology, Dermatology and Pharmacy Departments. University hospital La Paz. Madrid. Spain. Main Outcome Measures: Creatine phosphokinasse (CPK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Results: A 40-year-old female diagnosed of DM in October 1997. She firstly presented a rash on her hands and knees, the laboratory studies revealed an elevation of muscle enzymes, and the patient had dysphagia and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. CPK of 164 UI/L; AST of 28 UI/L; ALT of 22 UI/L; LDH of 459 UI/ L. During seven years, the treatment consisted of different doses of corticosteroids and methotrexate(10 mg/week) and was changed to cyclosporine (50 mg/12 h) and azathioprine (50 mg/7 days) since the patient showed esteroid myophaty and progressive muscular weakness. No significant improvements were observed, so a new treatment with infliximab 5 mg/Kg is begun as off-label use. Nevertheless, after the fourth infusion the patient developed an infusional reaction and infliximab was withdrawn. To date, the patient has received 2 doses of rituximab(1000 mg) as off-label use without any complication, being the current levels: CPK of 135 UI/L; AST of 19 UI/L; ALT of 15 UI/ L; LDH of 334 UI/L. Conclusions: B-cell depletion therapy with rituximab may be a viable option in patients with dermatomyositis refractory to current therapies. More studies are needed to determine the efficacy of anti-TNF (infliximab) and rituximab in DM Background and Objective: Bacterial resistances, compromising antibiotics efficiency, constitute a major problem of public health. Their emergence is related on overconsumption and misuse of antibiotics. Checking the use of antibiotics could help to prevent this phenomenon. In May 2007, the anti-microbial drug commission of the hospital set up a study in order to evaluate the appropriateness of prescriptions of 5 broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin, teicoplanin, ceftazidim, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin. Design: A multi-field team, composed with infectious disease physicians, pharmacists and bacteriologists, was involved in this study. An evaluation schedule was mapped out. This work presents the preliminary results, based on 1 month. Setting: Every care units, including orthopaedic surgery, intensive care, medicine and rehabilitation departments. Main Outcome Measures: Relevance of indications, choice of the antimicrobial agents, duration of the treatment, dosing and adjustment of treatment regarding bacteriological results were analysed by members of the multi-field team.",

This clinical study, carried out by a multi-field team, gives a reliable evaluation of antibiotherapy practices in the establishment. Corrective actions are considered. Keywords: Broad-spectrum antibiotic, Multi-field evaluation, Antibiotherapy quality PT-134 Care givers' assessment of the sedation drug use in an adult intensive care unit (ICU) Background and Objective: Sedation and analgesia are crucial therapies in ICU but few guidelines for their use are available. A recent retrospective local study showed that the drugs and doses used in the local adult ICU are similar to reports in the literature. Propofol, morphine, fentanyl and midazolam are the most prescribed drugs. This study aimed at measuring the nurses' and physicians' global assessment of the patient sedation and at comparing the results with those of the retrospective study. The final aim was to evaluate the need for local guidelines on ICU sedation. Design: Two anonymous 10-item questionnaires were developed for this protocol. The first one, sent to the 36 physicians of the ICU, included also 4 additional clinical cases to discuss. The second one was send to the 207 nurses. 6 questions were the same in both questionnaires. Setting: 34-bed adult ICU of a university hospital Main Outcome Measures: Physicians' and nurses' perception of sedation. Results: 47 percent of physicians and 15% of nurses returned the questionnaire despite 3 reminders. 47% physicians and 50% nurses considered the sedation adequate in 50-75% cases and 47% and 27% respectively considered it adequate in 75-90% cases. When the sedation was rated as inadequate, 80% of the nurses thought that patients were under-sedated while over-sedation was mentioned by 65% of the physicians. The vast majority of physicians (76%) and nurses (93%) mentioned using the sedation agitation scale (SAS) on a regular basis and 87% of physicians said that they prescribed a daily interruption of sedation. However, a daily interruption was observed in only 20% of cases during the retrospective study. This discrepancy could partly be explained by the lack of response from medical residents. Moreover, in practice, the sedation level is sometimes just decreased to allow a clinical evaluation of the patient without a formal interruption of the administration of esdatives. This could also explain the very low percentage observed. The discussion of the 4 clinical cases showed a large variability in the choice of sedative drugs. This demonstrated a lack of consensus among the prescribers. The implementation of local guidelines for the sedation was requested by nurses and physicians. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a large diversity among prescribers in the management of sedation. Hence, the need for guidelines exists. Such a document also requested by nurses and physicians. Once the new guidelines will be available, teaching to the nurses and to the medical residents has to be provided. The enhancement of the communication between physicians and nurses about the level of sedation and its goal has to be promoted. The pharmacist will contribute to the elaboration and implementation of the guidelines. Keywords: Sedation, Guidelines, ICU Pharmacy, Garcia de Orta Hospital, Almada, Portugal Background and Objective: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in Portugal. The treatment of breast cancer includes the surgery, radiation therapy or both, cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine and biological therapy or combinations of these. The aim of this study was to analyse the drugs use in breast cancer (chemotherapy schemes and hormonal agent) and haematopoietic growth factors needs. Design: A retrospective study was carried out of women with breast cancer diagnosis who received chemotherapy/hormone therapy during2005-May 2007. Data collected included: age, sex, stage disease, type of treatment, treatment line. Data was obtained from a computer application (SONHO) and medical order. A statistical evaluation was made with SPSS 11.0. Setting: Oncology Day Hospital and Pharmacy Department of Garcia Orta Hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Evaluation of different combinations of cytotoxics used in treatment of breast cancer. Results: The study included 192 patients, 190 female and 2 male. The mean age was 55.59 \u00b1 12.96 years. In this study 19.8% patients had metastatic disease. Sixteen combinations of cytotoxics in first line treatment were identified. The most common regimens was the FEC scheme(5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide), used in 39.6% of patients. In second line treatment 36.5% received docetaxel. In third line 20% of patients used G + VNB scheme (Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine). In first line treatment taxanes-based therapy was used in 25.7% of patients in 2005, 20.8% in 2006 and 12.1% in 2007. The anthracycline-containing therapy was used in first line in 45.9% (2005), 70.8% (2006) and 72.7% (2007). In early stage disease, the taxanes was used in 17.4% of patients in 2005, 50% in 2006 and 53.8% in 2007. In metastatic breast cancer the most used regimens are Docetaxel, Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine, Capecitabine, Doxorubicin Liposomal and Trastuzumab + Paclitaxel. In relation to endocrine therapy, tamoxifen was used in 34.4%, letrozol in 19.8% and 18.7% of patients change the hormonal agent prescription. The therapy with filgrastim was used in 47.9% of patients and 6.8% received darbepoetin. The patients with filgrastim prescription 51.1% received FEC scheme. The mean of units used was higher in TAC scheme (Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide) 23.14 \u00b1 9.15 units. Conclusions: The therapeutic options for patients with breast cancer are complex and varied. The use of taxanes-containing regimens in first line decrease in 2006 and increasing the use in early stage disease. In literature taxanes are not recommended as an option for the treatment of early breast cancer. The increasing use of taxanes treatment will potentially alter treatment strategies of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Erythropoeisis stimulating agents (ESAs) such as epoetins alfa and beta (rHuEPO) and darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp \u00d2 ; DA) are effective treatments of anemia. DA is a longer-acting ESA that can be administered less frequently. Previous studies have suggested that when patients are converted from rHuEPO to DA using an initial rHuEPO:DA conversion ratio of 200:1 (Aranesp \u00d2 EU label), the DA dose can be reduced while maintaining Hb levels. In this study, we estimated the relative doses of DA required to maintain comparable Hb levels in dialysis patients switched from rHuEPO. Design: Medline (1956-2007) and Embase",

This drug can cause hypoproliferative anemia bone marrow toxicity. The object of this study is evaluation of incidence of anemia in Iranian HIV positive patients that received ZDV in HAART regimens. Design: In a prospective study, 162 HIV positive patients were referred to Iranian HIV Research Center that start ZDV in HAART combination were entered the study and have followed for at least one year. Baseline and monthly hematological parameters were recorded. Setting: Iranian HIV Research Center. Main Outcome Measures: patients Demographic parameters, Route of Infection exposure, stage of Disease, CD4 counts, CBC, and Hematological Parameters. Results: Twenty nine (29) patients were excluded from the study because of impossible follow-up. From 133 patients, 77 of them have anemia (Hemoglobin less than 12 g/dl for female and less than 13 g/dl for male). Thirty there (33) patients have anemia before starting HAART. Thirty four (34) patients have showed anemia following received ZDV. Twenty (12) patients have improved anemia after were changed ZDV to stavudine. Conclusions: About 34% of HIV positive patients that were received ZDV have experienced anemia.Background and Objective: In June 2007, the use of infliximab has been approved by EMEA for the treatment of severe active Crohn's disease in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years old, who have not responded to conventional therapy (corticosteroid, immunomodulator and nutrition therapy). However, pediatricians were already using infliximab for patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and indeterminate colitis (IC). The goal of the study was to analyze infliximab prescriptions for children and to evaluate changes in prescriptions of corticosteroid due to the introduction of infliximab. Design: Retrospective study in 33 IBD patients in a pediatric teaching hospital. Setting: Gastroenterology unit and pharmacy department. Main Outcome Measures: Indications, infliximab dosage, anterior treatments, reason of therapeutic change (non-tolerance or inefficiency of anterior treatment and/or cortico-dependance), evolution of corticosteroid dosage 3 and 6 months after the introduction of infliximab. Results: Thirty-three children were treated by infliximab: 20 CD, 3 UC and 10 IC. Age for diagnosis was an average of 11 years old (5.2-16.5) and 13.5 years old (7-17) for the beginning of infliximab. Previous treatment to infliximab was immunomodulators, single therapy for 31 patients (azathioprine n = 23, mercaptopurine n = 3, methotrexate n = 5) or dual therapy (n = 2 azathioprine + methotrexate), with corticosteroids (n = 32) and/or mesalazine (n = 6). Various etiologies justified infliximab administration: corticodependance (n = 31), corticoresistance (n = 1), non compliance to corticotherapy (n = 1), insufficient efficacy of previous treatment (n = 23), non tolerance to previous treatment (n = 2). At the beginning, dosage of infliximab was 5 mg/kg. Dosages were increased (10 mg/kg) for 6 patients due to insufficient clinical results. One patient also had to be switched for adalimumab because he developed human antichimeric antibody (HACA). Among corticodependant patients (31), corticosteroids have been stopped after 3 or 6 months, 9 (29%) and 19 patients (61%) respectively. For 12 patients, corticosteroids were continued without reduction of dosages, six months after the introduction of infliximab. Conclusions: Infliximab is the only therapeutic alternative for children who are non tolerant or non respondent to conventional treatment. Moreover, this treatment permits the use of decreased dosage of corticosteroids, limiting their side effects, especially on children growth. However, HACA occurrence could limit its use in a long-term disease. Keywords: Infliximab, Inflammatory bowel syndrome, Pediatrics Chemotherapy indication was autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) (54%), leukaemia chemotherapy induction or consolidation (15%), leukaemia intensive chemotherapy (21%), myeloblastic allogeneic BMT (2%) and mini allogeneic BMT (8%).Treatments were prophylactic (60%), empirical (13%) or curative (15% for Aspergillus sp but no for Candida sp infections); 8% of the prescriptions related to local candidosis and 4% remained unknown.Although 66% of prescriptions were in accordance with internal guidelines concerned antifungal drug indication, 26% had wrong dosages e.g. no loading dose for voriconazole. Moreover, only 22% of the prescriptions were in accordance with French recommendations: neither voriconazole is approved in prophylaxis of aspergillosis in patients with autologous BMT nor antifungal drugs associations (ten prescriptions). Nevertheless, it may be a good way of medical management as hopeful patients outcomes have been obtained.Conclusions: Hematology Department guidelines should be reviewed in accordance with French recommendations, department's ecology and the state-of-the-art about treatment of fungal infections in patients with haematological malignancies. The accordance to further recommendations should be regularly assessed as well as resistance emergence. Background and Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) for the treatment of refractory autoimmune cytopenia, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) and immunemediated thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ITP and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP) Design: Descriptive, retrospective study based on rituximab prescriptions analysis. Patients were identified through medical reports delivered by compassionate use program. Data collection was made through the pharmaco-therapeutic profile and medical chart review Setting: General Teaching Hospital (420 beds) Main Outcome Measures: Patients who received any course of RTX for refractory immune cytopenia from January 2004 to May 2007 were evaluated. Data recorded included patients details, diagnosis, previous treatment, RTX schedule, number of courses and baseline hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet count (PQ) values. Effectiveness and tolerance were also considered. Response was evaluated according to criteria found in the literature: clinical symptoms resolution and a normal PQ count of 100.000/mm 3 for ITP/TTP or an Hb level [10 g/ dL achieved and maintained for at least 3 months for AHA. Additional response criteria for AHA was an Hb increase [1.5 g/dL 1 month after the last dose of RTX. Results: 11 patients (4 men), 54 doses RTX; average age 65 years (range 31-85). Diagnosis: AHA 7 (2 cases cold agglutinin disease), 3 ITP and 1 TTP. In 3 patients cytopenia (AHA) was associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had been previously treated with steroids and 8 had received 2 or more other treatment modalities (4 splenectomy, 7 immunosupressive agents, 7 intravenous immunoglobulin). Patients received 4-6 RTX infusions at a standard dose of 375 mg/m 2 once per week, in combination with steroids therapy in 10 cases. No serious infusion-related effects occurred, but 2 patients reported hematologic toxicity (fever and infection). All patients with AHA (7/7) and 2 patients with ITP (2/3) responded to the first course of RTX. One patient AHA had relapse after 29 months and responded to retreatment. ITP responders achieved durable response (16 and 3 months) and were offered second course of RTX after relapse (1 patients did not respond to retreatment). After 28 months follow-up, patient with TTP remained with acceptable PQ counts. Hb levels increased by a median of 3.5 g/dL (range 2-7,6) among the AHA responders. ITP + TTP responders achieved a median increase in PQ count of 172.500/mm 3 (range 67-188). Only responders who reached a 3 months follow-up were considered for response duration assessment: 5 AHA, 1 TTP, 3 ITP (1 retreatment). Median response duration was 17 months (range 4-29) for AHA and 16 months (range 3-31) for ITP + TTP Conclusions: Most of the literature findings for RTX in this setting were related to small series or isolated case descriptions. Despite the common limitation of the number of patients, our results showed that RTX appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of refractory autoimmune cytopenia. ",
