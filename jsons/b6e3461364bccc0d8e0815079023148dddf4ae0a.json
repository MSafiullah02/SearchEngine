Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that affects over 71 million people in the global population. Hepatocytes infected with HCV produce types I and III IFNs. These endogenous IFNs upregulate a set of ISGs that negatively impact the outcome of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin treatments, which were previously used to treat HCV. In addition, the IFNL4 genotype was the primary polymorphism responsible for a suboptimal treatment response to pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin. However, recently developed direct-acting antivirals have demonstrated a high rate of sustained virological response without pegylated IFN-\u03b1. Herein, we review recent studies on types I and III IFN responses in HCV-infected hepatocytes. In particular, we focused on open issues related to IFN responses in the direct-acting antiviral era.",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) have critical antiviral activities and immune regulatory functions in infections and autoimmunity. These IFN functions are mediated by inducing the expression of various IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [1] . IFNs are divided into three major types: type I, which includes IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 species; type II, which includes IFN-\u03b3 species, and type III, which includes IFN-\u03bb species [2] . Type III IFNs were not identified until nearly five decades after the discovery of type I IFNs. Types I and III IFNs are similar in their induction mechanisms and in the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to ISG expression. However, they use different receptors and are encoded by distinct genes [2] . The type III IFN family is composed of four members: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B), and the recently identified IFN-\u03bb4. Among these, IFN-\u03bb4 is unique, because it is only produced in individuals with a \u2206G allele of the variant rs368234815-\u2206G/TT [3, 4] . Type III IFN responses to infections or autoimmunity are predominantly observed in epithelial barriers, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts [5] [6] [7] [8] . Early IFN-\u03bb antiviral activity limits infection and prevents triggering other systemic immune responses and inflammation [5, 6] . However, the induction of a persistent type III IFN response can hamper cellular responses to type I IFNs, particularly IFN-\u03b1 [2, [9] [10] [11] .",

HCV encodes structural proteins, including the core, E1, and E2 proteins; it also encodes non-structural proteins, including p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [13] . Acute HCV infections tend to evolve to chronic persistent infections. Historically, HCV infections were generally treated with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 (peg-IFN-\u03b1) and ribavirin. However, with the recent introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which target various HCV non-structural proteins, patients can be treated without serious adverse effects, and a high rate of sustained virological response (SVR) can be achieved [13] . However, in some cases, HCV treatment is ineffective. One potential explanation for this result could be the presence of genotype-or subtype-specific resistance-associated substitutions that are either pre-existing or drug-induced [14] .",

Several research groups, including ours, have shown that HCV-infected liver cells produced predominantly type III IFNs [9] [10] [11] 22] . Furthermore, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb4 was rapidly produced in HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes that carried the rs368234815-\u2206G allele, which encodes the fully active IFN-\u03bb4 protein [9] . Previous studies have mainly focused either on the association between IFNL4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and spontaneous HCV clearance or on the pegylated-IFN-\u03b1 treatment response [3, [23] [24] [25] . The IFNL4 genotype has remained notable in the DAA era. It was recently shown that the IFNL4 genotype affected the response to DAA-based regimens among patients with HCV [26] [27] [28] .",

            "text": "Types I and III IFNs initiate intracellular signaling through autocrine and paracrine pathways [2] . Types I and III IFNs bind to heterodimeric receptors, including type I IFN receptor 1/2 (IFNAR1/2) and IFN-\u03bb receptor 1 (IFNLR1)/interleukin 10 receptor 2 (IL10R2), respectively [29] . When types I and III IFNs bind to their receptors, the intracellular receptor subunits undergo conformational changes to interact with Janus kinases (JAKs), which lead to the activation of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. The JAKs include JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) [30] . The binding of both type I and type III IFNs to their respective receptor complexes leads to the phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2. On the other hand, the binding of type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) to the receptor complex triggers the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 complex. These activated JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on IFN receptors, which then recruit STAT proteins [29] . In activating JAK-STAT signaling, IFN-\u03b3 mainly stimulates the formation of STAT1 homodimers, which directly bind to DNA [31] . Alternatively, types I and III IFNs mainly drive the formation of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers, which bind to interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9); together, these proteins form a complex known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) [31] . ISGF3 is translocated to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor to induce the expression of ISGs [29] . In the nucleus, STAT1 homodimers bind to the \u03b3-activated sequence (GAS) on DNA, and ISGF3 binds to interferon-stimulated regulatory elements (ISREs) on DNA [31] . ISGs have upstream regulatory regions that carry different types of STAT-binding elements, including solitary GAS elements, solitary ISREs, or combined GAS/ISRE elements [31] . Moreover, diverse binding sites and transcription factors that are active in the regulatory regions upstream of ISGs can subtly shift to allow the expression of different ISG subsets [2] . Consequently, upon IFN stimulation, ISG expression can vary in composition, kinetics, and scale, depending on which IFNs induce the signaling cascade [2] .",

Furthermore, Forero and colleagues also emphasized that the failure of type III IFNs to induce IRF1-mediated chemokine production was due to low IFNLR1 expression levels. When IFNLR1 expression was forced, type III IFNs could induce IRF1-mediated chemokine production [33, 34] . The importance of IRF1 to the antiviral reaction in liver cells was demonstrated in a different study [36] .

            "text": "Although tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for STAT activation; unphosphorylated STAT proteins continue to perform integral functions that activate ISGs [37] . In recent studies, unphosphorylated STATs (U-STATs; i.e., those with unphosphorylated tyrosine residues) were observed in the nucleus, where they bound to the upstream regulatory regions and initiated the expression of a set of ISGs [10, 11, 31, [38] [39] [40] . One study reported that stimulating cells with a low IFN-\u03b2 concentration maintained ISG expression for two or three days after tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 reverted to U-STAT [38] . Another report demonstrated the role of unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) in prolonged ISG induction with type I IFN treatment [39] . After initially stimulating cells with type I or III IFN, abundant quantities of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were produced. Even without tyrosine phosphorylation, these proteins combined to form U-ISGF3 [11, 31, 39] . The unique binding of U-ISGF3 resulted in the expression of approximately 30 ISGs. The upregulation of these ISGs was durable; it persisted in cells for several days after the initial IFN stimulation [11, 31, 39] . The majority of ISGs induced by U-ISGF3 had antiviral activity, and they could protect against DNA damage [31, 39] . Another recent study demonstrated that IFN-independent baseline ISG expression was mediated by the U-ISGF3 complex in hepatocytes, liver organoids, and liver tissue cultures [41] . In that study, a phosphorylation-deficient STAT1 mutant protein was also active and non-inferior to the wild-type protein in its ability to upregulate ISGs that conferred antiviral activity in liver-derived cells [41] . Interestingly, mice with a homozygous Y701F mutation in Stat1 showed a dramatic reduction in Stat1 protein expression. That finding suggested that initial IFN-dependent signaling played an important role in Stat1 expression. The rapid induction of ISGs by types I and II IFNs was absent in phosphorylation-defective Stat1-Y701F cells [42, 43] .",

Phosphorylation of the proximal tyrosine residue on STAT1 is prevented by PIAS-induced STAT1 SUMOylation, which results in the generation of partially phosphorylated STAT dimers.

There are three classes of PRRs: retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) [56] . A previous study found that RIG-I detected the HCV 3 untranslated region (UTR). However, a more recent study found that melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), not RIG-I, played a central role in detecting HCV RNA [57, 58] . Another study demonstrated a sequential activation of the innate signaling by RIG-I and MDA5 after HCV infection [59] . The binding of RIG-I or MDA-5 to mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) resulted in the downstream activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and IRF3 [60] . Recent evidence has suggested that IFN signaling triggered by HCV critically relies on a probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase, known as the laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) protein.",

The cleavage of MAVS by the HCV serine protease was verified by analyzing HCV-infected liver tissues [72] . Interestingly, a conserved MAVS mutation found in non-human primates prevented viral protease antagonism and resulted in unchecked IFN production in 'resistant' MAVS-expressing cells [73] . HCV NS4B can also inhibit RLR-mediated IFN production by targeting a protein called the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an adaptor protein that facilitates IRF3 phosphorylation by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [74] [75] [76] . However, the mechanisms which dictate how NS4B blocks the STING-mediated signaling pathway are different among the published reports. Ding et al. demonstrated that NS4B disrupts the binding of STING and TBK1 [76] , whereas Nitta et al. showed that NS4B blocks the interaction between MAVS and STING [75] .",

In contrast, IFNLR1 is expressed at high levels in human hepatocytes, and IFN-\u03bbs play an important role in resisting HCV and other viral infections [35] . IFN-\u03bbs are generated and function as long as HCV persists in the liver; thus, the infected liver exhibits high expression levels of many ISGs [10, 11, 81, 82] . Numerous ISGs were found to play various roles during the HCV life cycle [83] . ISGs restrict the viral spread and induce various types of immune responses [83] .",

Consequently, pegylated IFN-\u03bb was developed for treating HBV or HCV infections. Clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of pegylated IFN-\u03bb for treating HCV infections showed promising results [84] . Moreover, adverse effects associated with therapeutic IFN-\u03bb might be less severe than those associated with type I IFNs, because fewer cell types express IFNLR compared to IFNAR, though both are expressed in hepatocytes. The clinical development of pegylated IFN-\u03bb as a therapeutic option for chronic HCV infections was terminated upon the discovery of DAAs. However, clinical studies on pegylated IFN-\u03bb highlighted the safety of pegylated IFN-\u03bb, which raised the possibility that it may be useful for treating other viral infections in humans.",

Furthermore, ISG mRNAs were detected concurrently with HCV RNA in HCV-infected hepatocytes [85] . Despite the continuous upregulation of ISGs, livers that are chronically infected with HCV exhibit scant levels of phosphorylated STAT1 [11] . Instead, unphosphorylated STATs are evident in HCV-infected livers [39, 41] . In HCV-infected cells, U-ISGF3 induces the expression of a particular set of ISGs, with antiviral activities that are constitutively sustained throughout the infection [11, 41] . Prolonged ISG expression is not always beneficial; both spontaneous viral clearance [23] and SVR induced with IFN-\u03b1-based treatments [19, 86, 87] were negatively correlated with the upregulation of baseline ISGs [10, 11] . A study from our group indicated that U-ISGF3 induced sustained ISG15 upregulation, as a consequence of sustained exposure to the IFN-\u03bbs produced endogenously during HCV infections [11] . Unresponsiveness to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 therapy arose from the stabilization of USP18 protein by ISG15 [9, 11, 49] . Thus, the abundance of ISG15 in HCV-infected livers explained why patients with elevated baseline hepatic ISGs showed poor responses to IFN-\u03b1-based therapy [11, 15, 88] .",

Previously, forced expression of the IFNL4-\u2206G allele failed to produce significant amounts of IFN-\u03bb4 protein in mammalian cells [89] . Although recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 could be purified from a bacterial expression system [4] , our group recently developed an efficient method for recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 production [91] . We introduced new N-glycosylation sites in the IFN-\u03bb4 protein, and found that the variant proteins were produced efficiently in mammalian cells. Moreover, the N-glycosylated IFN-\u03bb4 displayed more robust ISG-inducing activity compared to a recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 produced with a bacterial system [91] . Several studies have reported that ISG upregulation in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and HepG2 cells could be induced by forced IFNL4 gene expression, or treatment with a recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 protein [9, 89, 92, 93] that displayed antiviral activity against HCV [9, 93, 94] . Recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 and IFN-\u03bb3 induce similar ISG expression patterns [4, 9] , because both activate the JAK-STAT pathway by binding to the IFN-\u03bb receptor [9, 95] . Our group demonstrated that HCV infections induced IFN-\u03bb4 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in PHHs [9] .",

Moreover, recent genome-wide association studies on human and viral data from Caucasian patients with HCV genotype 3a infections demonstrated that the differential production and functions of IFN-\u03bb4-P70 and IFN-\u03bb4-S70 impacted the viral load and the variability of viral amino acids.

A suboptimal treatment response to pegylated IFN-\u03b1 in HCV infections was primarily associated with the IFNL4-\u2206G allele [3, 25, 89] . Previous studies have demonstrated that the IFNL4-\u2206G genotype was correlated with high intrahepatic ISG levels [9, 10, 97] and IFN-\u03bb4 expression was correlated with high liver ISG15 levels in chronic HCV infections [18] . A functionally impaired form of the IFN-\u03bb4 protein, the IFN-\u03bb4-S70 variant, was associated with the relatively weak induction of intrahepatic ISGs; this finding indicated that IFN-\u03bb4 was the primary driver of ISG inductions in HCV-infected livers [23] . In livers with the IFNL4-\u2206G genotype, elevated baseline ISGs were associated with less additional ISG upregulation when treated with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 ( Figure 2) . Thus, IFN-\u03bb4 protein production in IFNL4-\u2206G livers might play a critical role in upregulating ISG expression in chronic HCV infections. Our group previously demonstrated that both ISG15 and USP18 protein levels were elevated in HCV-infected livers [11] . We found that the prolonged stimulation of recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 or transfection of the IFNL4 gene induced robust, sustained ISG15 upregulation through the induction of U-ISGF3, which stabilized the USP18 protein and led to the unresponsiveness to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment ( Figure 2) [9, 11, 22] . Thus, the IFNL4 rs368234815-\u2206G allele hampered the response to pegylated IFN-\u03b1 treatment.",

(A) In patients with the IFNL4-\u0394G/\u0394G (rs368234815) or IFNL4-\u0394G/TT genotype, IFN-\u03bbs (including IFN-\u03bb4) and type I IFNs are produced. When type I and III IFNs bind to their receptors, they trigger the initial formation of ISGF3, which is composed of phosphorylated STAT1, phosphorylated STAT2, and IRF9. ISGF3 stimulates the expression of ISGs. After an HCV infection is established, ISG expression is maintained by U-ISGF3, which is composed of high levels of unphosphorylated STAT1, unphosphorylated STAT2, and IRF9. U-ISGF3 induces the abundant production of ISG15 in HCVinfected cells. Subsequently, ISG15 stabilizes the USP18 protein. In turn, USP18 blocks signaling through the IFN-\u03b1-bound IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor, which attenuates the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1. As a result, pegylated IFN-\u03b1 treatment has low efficacy. (B) In patients with the IFNL4-TT/TT (rs368234815) genotype, functional IFN-\u03bb4 protein is not produced. In this case, U-ISGF3 is less abundant, which leads to weak ISG15 induction and low USP18 protein levels in infected hepatocytes. Consequently, the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 is not attenuated. As a result, pegylated IFN-\u03b1 has potent antiviral efficacy. Pointed arrows indicate activation; Blocked arrows indicate inhibition. Ub: ubiquitin.",

The rs368234815-\u2206G allele, which encodes the fully active IFN-\u03bb4, was correlated with the upregulation of ISGs in infected livers. Recently, an association was also observed between the IFNL4 genotype and virologic relapse after DAA therapy [16, 26, 28] . The recent BOSON trial tested patients infected with HCV genotype 3 that were treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin. They revealed that the IFNL4-CC genotype was closely correlated with SVR and with lower baseline ISG levels in peripheral blood and liver [16] . Another recent analysis of the ION-3 trial showed that the IFNL4 rs12979860 polymorphism was associated with virologic relapse in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, after eight weeks of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir treatment [27] . Compared to patients with the unfavorable IFNL4 rs12979860-CT or TT genotype, fewer patients with the IFNL4 rs12979860-CC genotype experienced a viral relapse (5.8% vs. 1.8%) [27, 104] . In the 8-week arm of the POLARIS-2 trial, the probability of relapse after sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir treatment was five-fold higher in patients with the unfavorable IFNL4 rs12979860 genotype (CT or TT), compared to patients with IFNL4 rs12979860-CC [26, 105] . The favorable IFNL4 rs12979860-CC and rs368234815-TT/TT genotypes were detected more frequently in people of Asian descent than in those of European descent; thus, Asian individuals might have markedly low virologic relapse rates after DAA treatment [26] .",

Consistent with that study, another study reported that the frequency of Y93H, the NS5A resistance-associated substitution, in HCV genotype 1 was closely correlated with the presence of favorable IFNL4 genotypes and a high viral load at baseline. This finding might explain why IFNL4 genotypes were not correlated or were negatively correlated with treatment responses to DAA regimens that included NS5A inhibitors [106] . Another study showed that intrahepatic ISG expression at treatment conclusion was higher with a SVR than with a viral relapse [101] . Based on that study, we could infer that maintaining intrahepatic type I IFN signaling at the end of treatment, and not ISG downregulation, might facilitate HCV eradication and the prevention of viral relapse after DAA treatment [101] . Consistent with that study, another recent report showed that DAA plus ribavirin treatment upregulated the expression of one ISG, called tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22) [107] . They observed that TRIM22 expression was higher in patients that achieved SVR compared to untreated patients [107] .

A recent study from our group demonstrated that pre-treatment ISG activation in PBMCs might be due to type I IFN activation of JAK-STAT signaling [108] . Another recent study demonstrated that, at two and four weeks after starting DAA treatment, most ISGs were downregulated in PBMCs, and at the end of treatment, they were relatively elevated, but not above the baseline ISG level [102] . Interestingly, the serum levels of IFN-\u03b1-related chemokines increased concurrently with the reduction in ISG levels, but Th1 and Th2-related cytokines did not show that behavior [102] . In another study, among patients with HIV-1 that had acute HCV infections, ISGs were downregulated in PBMCs during DAA therapy. After therapy, the ISG levels increased in patients that relapsed, but not in patients that achieved a SVR [109] . In patients with HCV infections, baseline ISG levels in PBMCs were affected by the IFNL4 genotype [98] . Furthermore, the unfavorable IFNL4 genotype was encountered more frequently in HCV infections, when patients had cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and metabolic extrahepatic symptoms. That finding suggested that DAA therapy might alleviate HCV-induced extrahepatic symptoms by downregulating extrahepatic ISGs [110, 111] .",

HCV and other RNA viruses tend to employ multiple strategies for evading IFN responses. We need a comprehensive understanding of these viral strategies to block viral persistence. To understand downstream IFN signaling, we need further clarification of the association between HCV-induced canonical and non-canonical JAK/STAT pathways. Moreover, the differential role of types I and III IFN responses in HCV-infected hepatocytes should be clarified. Clarifying the hepatocyte-specific immune responses to HCV infection, in association with the host IFNL4 genotypes, may help researchers understand the initial defense mechanisms to other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Finally, IFN-\u03bb4 seems to impact both the response to IFN-\u03b1-based treatment and the response to DAA treatment; these features of IFN-\u03bb4 should be studied further and extended to other types of viral infections.",
