NP, and particularly VAP, are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [4, 5], and in many regions, antimicrobial resistance is making these infections increasingly difficult to treat [5]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli are the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients with pneumonia worldwide, of which many show reduced (< 90%) susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials for pneumonia such as third-generation cephalosporins, thereby increasing reliance on carbapenems [6\u20138]. Unfortunately, the increasing resistance among clinically important Gram-negative bacteria in recent decades has occurred in the context of declining development of new antimicrobial therapies, particularly those targeting Gram-negative bacteria [9]: between 2005 (approval of tigecycline) and 2017 (approval of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam), no new treatments were approved for NP/VAP due to Gram-negative bacteria.",

First, as the infection occurs in the lungs, there is a potential for delayed or insufficient free drug penetration to the infection site. Second, there is evidence that bacteria isolated from patients with NP/VAP are less susceptible to antibacterial agents than isolates of the same species from other infections; such increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have adversely influenced the outcomes of some clinical trials of new drugs in this population [10, 11]. Third, the reduced susceptibility of these bacteria to currently available antibiotics [6] can be compounded by the rapid elimination of renally cleared agents in some patients due to augmented renal clearance (ARC) [12]. Finally, alterations in organ function and hemodynamics in critically ill patients with NP can result in wide variability in antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PKs) and thus affect the ability to achieve therapeutic concentrations [13\u201315].",

The pitfalls of developing drugs for use in pneumonia without accounting for the above factors have been demonstrated for other antimicrobial therapies. The decreased in vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of pulmonary surfactant was suggested as a possible explanation for its failure in clinical trials for community-acquired pneumonia [16]. Initial preclinical studies of ceftobiprole assessed penetration of the drug into mouse but not human epithelial lining fluid (ELF), the fluid layer covering the mucosae of the alveoli and of the small and large airways [17]. The median ceftobiprole area under the curve (AUC) ratio for ELF/plasma was 0.69 in mice, whereas the ratio in humans was subsequently found to be only 0.15, resulting in an underestimation of the effective dosage required for phase III trials in patients with NP. Moreover, failure to consider ARC when determining dosages may also result in the failure of clinical trials. For example, in trials of doripenem, tigecycline, and ceftobiprole, ARC was implicated as a factor in their relatively low efficacy [18].",

The phase II trials, and the first four phase III trials, enrolled adults with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), and supported initial US (in 2015) and European (in 2016) approvals in these indications [30, 31]. Population PK modeling and probability of target attainment (PTA) analyses, using phase I and II clinical PK data and PK/PD targets derived from preclinical data (discussed below), were used to select a ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosage of 2000/500 mg by 2-h intravenous infusion q8h for patients with normal renal function across all of the phase III trials. The phase III trials all included sparse PK sampling schedules, and at various stages during the development program, additional patient PK and covariate data were incorporated into updated iterations of the ceftazidime and avibactam population PK models to evaluate the performance of the selected dose by assessing model predictions versus actual exposures. These analyses provided assurance that the selected regimen would provide adequate exposures for various clinically important patient subgroups, including patients with NP/VAP [31\u201333], and also supported selection of dosage adjustments for renal function [34, 35]. In conjunction with microbiological surveillance data and data from in vitro and animal models, the simulations also supported determination of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam MIC susceptibility breakpoints [36].",

In the human phase I study, ELF/plasma AUC ratios were calculated using total (free + bound) plasma concentrations of ceftazidime and avibactam (i.e., they were not corrected for differences in protein binding in plasma and ELF) [56], resulting in slightly lower estimated human ELF/plasma exposure ratios than if calculated using unbound fractions. In contrast, the murine ELF/plasma AUC ratios accounted for protein binding of ceftazidime and avibactam, and were calculated using free concentrations (protein binding is approximately 10% for both ceftazidime and avibactam in plasma, and negligible in ELF) [53, 55]. Both ceftazidime and avibactam penetrated similarly into mouse (Figs. 1 and 2) and human ELF (Fig. 3) in a dose-proportional manner [55, 56], and concentration-time profiles in ELF were a similar shape to those in plasma (Figs. 1 and 3). The mouse ELF:plasma AUC ratios for ceftazidime and avibactam (20\u201324%) were slightly lower than the corresponding human values (31\u201335%) [55, 56], suggesting that the mouse data provided a conservative indication of ELF penetration achieved in humans. Thus, as lower penetration in mouse still resulted in effective bacterial killing, although ELF concentrations in humans were a proportion of those in plasma, these were considered sufficient to achieve adequate free lung exposures.",

(2018) [33] for a review of PK/PD target selection), to be attained simultaneously in each simulated patient, were used in PTA analyses to guide dosage selection based on achievement of > 90% joint PTA [31, 32, 68].",

In brief, ceftazidime 2000 mg q8h was selected as the \u201cstarting point,\u201d as this is the recommended monotherapy dose for severe infections [69], co-administered with avibactam 500 mg q8h in a 4:1 fixed-dose ratio. At the time of dosage selection for REPROVE, PK data for ceftazidime\u2013avibactam were available from five phase I studies in healthy volunteers and a phase II study in patients with cIAI treated with ceftazidime\u2013avibactam 2000/500 mg 30-min intravenous infusions q8h. Ceftazidime and avibactam population PK models were developed using data from these studies and used to guide dosage selection for REPROVE, because no clinical trial PK data were available at the time for ceftazidime\u2013avibactam in patients with NP/VAP. For both ceftazidime and avibactam, the final models were two-compartmental, with body-surface-area-normalized creatinine clearance (CLCR), age, body weight, and study population (healthy subjects vs patients) identified as covariates [64, 70]. The use of population PK models based on patients with cIAI was considered appropriate for dosage selection in NP, as the PK profile of ceftazidime alone was previously shown to be comparable across cIAI and NP patient populations [71, 72]. We assumed that the same would be true for avibactam, given the generally similar PK profiles of the two compounds [73].",

            "text": "ARC occurs commonly in patients who are critically ill, such as those with VAP, resulting in faster elimination of renally cleared drugs [10, 15]. As both ceftazidime and avibactam are almost entirely cleared by the kidneys, and CLCR was identified as a significant covariate affecting the exposures of both drugs in the population PK models, the effect of high CLCR was an important consideration in dosage selection for NP/VAP [10]. Following completion of the ceftazidime\u2013avibactam phase III cIAI and cUTI trials, updated population PK models were developed which included data from 101 phase III patients with estimated CLCR 150\u2013180 mL/min and 76 with CLCR 180\u2013395 mL/min [31]. These updated models were used to explore specific considerations for the CLCR distribution in simulations of patients with NP/VAP [70]. We assumed that the relationships between ceftazidime and avibactam exposures and high CLCR were already well characterized in the models based on patients with cIAI. This assumption was supported by data from a phase I study which explored the impact of ARC on avibactam exposure when dosed in combination with ceftaroline fosamil in patients with confirmed ARC (measured CLCR \u2265 140 mL/min) and sepsis [31]. An increase in avibactam CL in patients with ARC and sepsis was seen compared with healthy subjects (noncompartmental analysis), resulting in an average 28.4% lower AUC0\u2013t, which was comparable to the avibactam exposure seen in phase III patients with cIAI with estimated CLCR > 150 mL/min [31]. There was a similar impact of CLCR > 150 mL/min on the exposure of ceftazidime. The similar magnitudes of differences in exposures (compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function) between patients with cIAI with high estimated CLCR (> 150 mL/min) and patients with ARC and sepsis suggested that it was plausible to use estimations of high CLCR from the phase III data to model the impact of ARC on PTA.",

During typical PTA simulations, the CLCR distribution is re-sampled using the population model patient dataset. In the original simulations for NP dose selection, the population PK models were developed using data from patients with cIAI, and did not include patients with NP. Therefore, the impact of high CLCR on PTA was analyzed in three scenarios (Fig. 5). First, the CLCR distribution from patients with cIAI was replaced with literature-reported values from patients with NP, using CLCR distributions from non-ventilated (case 1) and ventilated (case 2) patients [10]. A third approach (case 3), simulated a \u201chigh CLCR distribution\u201d by removing low clearances from a natural patient distribution (i.e., of the CLCR range seen in a clinical trial, the distribution of values > 80 mL/min was taken and re-sampled). In this instance, the CLCR distribution was derived from two phase III studies of ceftaroline fosamil in complicated skin and soft-tissue infection [74]. These two studies included multiple subjects with infection and high CLCR, and were therefore considered informative for simulations of patients with NP (Fig. 5). In this distribution, at least 25% of patients had CLCR > 160 mL/min and could be considered to have ARC. Other covariates (age, weight, height, and gender) were simulated from their distribution functions obtained from the phase II trial in patients with cIAI [24, 70].",

This decision was supported by the PK analyses described above and the following additional data. At the time of the European approval in HAP/VAP, results from the RECLAIM, REPRISE, RECAPTURE, and RECLAIM 3 phase III clinical trials had confirmed the efficacy in patients with cIAI and cUTI of the proposed NP dosage regimen [25\u201328]. Blinded interim plasma concentration data were also available from 308 patients (109 with VAP) from REPROVE, which demonstrated similar ceftazidime and avibactam plasma exposures in patients with NP or VAP compared with those for patients with cIAI [31]. Updated ceftazidime and avibactam population models, including data from the phase III clinical trials in cIAI and cUTI, were used together with blinded demographic data from patients with NP and VAP in REPROVE to simulate joint PTA for patients with NP, including VAP, and confirmed high joint PTA (> 98%) in these patients at ceftazidime\u2013avibactam MICs up to 8 mg/L [31]. Ceftazidime and avibactam plasma\u2013ELF relationships were also further characterized by developing population PK models for ceftazidime and avibactam in plasma and ELF using data from the phase I ELF study [56, 75]. ELF penetration of ceftazidime and avibactam from plasma occurred rapidly and was nonlinear, with penetration of both drugs greater than previously calculated using noncompartmental AUC methods [75]. Simulation of ELF concentration\u2013time profiles demonstrated that most subjects achieved ceftazidime and avibactam ELF exposures exceeding their respective plasma PK/PD targets by the midpoint of the dosing interval (Fig. 6). This analysis confirmed that substantial ELF penetration is achieved in healthy subjects, and that the exposures in the lungs of both drugs administered at the proposed dosage regimen were predicted to exceed levels required for efficacy.",

Ceftazidime\u2013avibactam was non-inferior to meropenem with respect to clinical cure at test of cure (primary endpoint) [29] and for the US FDA\u2013specified endpoint of all-cause mortality at day 28 [39]. Adverse events were as expected for the patient population and consistent with the established safety profile of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam [29, 39]. Of note, ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosage adjustments for CLCR < 50 mL/min were modified by protocol amendment during the study to reflect approved European and US labeling [68]. Patients in REPROVE receiving the original dosage adjustments were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses but not from the US analyses; however, in both cases, the non-inferiority criteria were met [29, 39]. Thus, the selected ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosage regimens (including recommended adjustments for impaired renal function) were associated with clinical efficacy in patients with NP, including VAP, validating the dosage selection approach.",

The final models included ceftazidime and avibactam PK data from 1975 and 2249 individuals, respectively, including 412 patients with NP, of whom 138 had VAP. A high proportion of patient PK data was included in these models, including patients with a wide range of renal function, and substantial numbers of patients with more severe infection (438 patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score > 10, and 773 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] at baseline). Consistent with the earlier population PK models, CLCR was the key covariate that affected CL of both drugs. The CL of avibactam and ceftazidime was close to proportional to CLCR at CLCR values < 80 mL/min and < 100 mL/min, respectively; at higher CLCR values, CL increased modestly (shallow slope) as CLCR increased.",

Specifically, we considered ceftazidime\u2013avibactam MIC distributions against bacteria isolated from patients with pneumonia, drug penetration to the infection site, potential antagonism by lung surfactant (and antagonistic interaction with other antimicrobials [63]), the suitability of using murine-derived plasma PK/PD targets for human dosage selection, and the phenomenon of ARC that may occur in critically ill patients. These analyses had an important role in supporting the approval of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam in Europe for the treatment of patients with HAP, including VAP [37], prior to the availability of clinical data in this indication. Results from the REPROVE trial subsequently confirmed the efficacy and safety of the approved ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosage regimen in patients with NP, including VAP [29, 39].

            "text": "Notwithstanding the successful outcome of dosage selection for ceftazidime\u2013avibactam reported here, there were some limitations to the overall modeling approach, and in the data available for the population PK analyses. For example, we did not use a joint population PK model, which would have allowed for parametric simulations with consideration of PK parameter correlations. Moreover, the lack of ELF data from patients with lung infections required extrapolation from murine data and modeling of ELF penetration based on plasma concentrations. While recognizing the limitations of ELF measurements, we believe that the ceftazidime and avibactam ELF population PK models and exposure calculations can be considered conservative, and the positive outcome of the REPROVE trial provides further validation of the view that adequate lung tissue penetration is achieved in patients. Initial dosage selection was based on PK data from subjects with a limited range of CLCR, with updated models based on phase III cIAI data subsequently used for evaluating exposures and PTA in patients with NP/VAP, a population with highly variable renal function, including ARC. In addition, there are limitations in the use of the Cockcroft\u2013Gault formula for estimation of renal function in subjects with high CLCR. Similarly, there are known effects of mechanical ventilation on the PK of multiple drugs, including antibiotics. Our analysis identifying patients in REPROVE as NPv, VAP, or non-VAP was based on the presence of a ventilator in the hospital room (using available study data), which limited exploration of the impact of mechanical ventilation. However, it should again be emphasized that the results from REPROVE support the selected ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosage as efficacious in patients with NP and VAP. Finally, owing to restrictions in the available clinical data, the population PK models were unable to provide specific exposure and PTA predictions for some patient groups of clinical interest, such as those with neutropenia. However, ceftazidime monotherapy is approved for the treatment of febrile neutropenia, and since the action of avibactam is independent of neutrophils, it is reasonable to expect that the ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosages, PK/PD targets, and exposures described here would also apply in patients with neutropenia with infections caused by \u03b2-lactamase-mediated ceftazidime-resistant (but ceftazidime\u2013avibactam susceptible) bacteria.",

As Ambrose and colleagues have suggested, this can potentially be avoided by considering the confounders and determinants of response in this patient population and conducting appropriate experiments to inform dosage regimen decisions [10]. Based on the work described here, ceftazidime\u2013avibactam 2000/500 mg 2-h intravenous infusion q8h (adjusted for renal function) was the dosage regimen selected for patients with NP, including VAP, and which was evaluated in the phase III REPROVE trial. The results from REPROVE confirmed that the selected ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dosage regimen was associated with efficacy in patients with NP, including VAP, validating the approach described here for dosage selection in REPROVE. The present work serves as a clinically successful example of designing dosing for clinical trialing of a new antibacterial agent in the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of NP, including VAP.",
