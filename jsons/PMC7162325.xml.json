Biosafety measures designed to ensure the safety of laboratory workers include the use of various primary and secondary barriers, many of which are due to the advent of new technologies in the fields of materials science and engineering. Persons carrying out the protocols in this manual may encounter potentially hazardous materials such as pathogenic and infectious biological agents, as well as toxic chemicals and carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic reagents (see unit\nmc01a03). In the case of biological agents, it has long been recognized that laboratory workers can acquire infections from the agents they manipulate, thus making the very nature of their work an occupational hazard.",

            "text": "As an example, in 1910, Dr. Howard Taylor Ricketts acquired typhus and died while studying the disease using a primitive containment device. Since that time, there have been many reports of laboratory\u2010acquired infection, with many more cases probably having gone unreported. Although it would be comforting to consider laboratory\u2010acquired infection an artifact of a less sophisticated time in biomedical research, recent examples refute this. In 2001, for example, a public health laboratory worker in the U.S. acquired cutaneous anthrax due to an unauthorized switch in disinfectants (MMWR, 2002). In 2004, one of the last known deaths caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)\u2010associated coronavirus was that of the mother of a researcher who had acquired SARS in a Beijing laboratory and transmitted it to her (Normille, 2004). Again, the cause was likely an unauthorized or untested procedure to inactivate the virus. Also in 2004, a sample of \nBacillus anthracis\n was presumably inactivated in a laboratory in Maryland and sent to researchers in California for use in animal studies (Enserink and Kaiser, 2004; MMWR, 2005). When the study animals died with symptoms of anthrax, it was found that the inactivation procedure had not been validated in the laboratory in Maryland and that viable \nB. anthracis\n was received by an unsuspecting laboratory. Eight laboratory workers received post\u2010exposure treatment; none developed anthrax. These recent events highlight the continuing possibility of the occurrence of laboratory\u2010acquired infections due to simple and preventable laboratory errors.",

Many types of disinfectants are available\u2014each should be evaluated to determine if it is appropriate to inactivate the research materials being used and the surfaces to be cleaned. For example, a 1:10 dilution of commercially available household bleach is very effective against most microorganisms. However, over time, bleach can be corrosive and will pit stainless steel surfaces, thus the use of bleach should be followed by a water rinse on these surfaces. In addition, the dilution must be prepared daily due to the rapid degradation of hypochlorite ions over time. Another common disinfectant is 70% isopropyl alcohol. Although quite effective at inactivating several classes of microbes, its use on work surfaces results in nearly immediate evaporation, which does not allow for the contact time necessary required for inactivation. When using commercially available products, the label, the product information sheet, and the material safety data sheet must be reviewed to determine appropriate use. Major laboratory suppliers sell disinfectants based on quaternary ammonium compounds that are acceptable for routine biohazard decontamination (see mcaspl). These include Roccal (Baxter), Vesphene II (Fisher), and industrial disinfectants such as concentrated Lysol.",

These cabinets protect the experiment and those exposed to the exhaust by scrubbing the particulate\u2010laden air currents via high\u2010efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. A HEPA filter, by requirement, is 99.97% effective at removing particles of 0.3 \u00b5m\u2014the particle size at which HEPA filters are the least efficient. Due to a diversity of particle\u2010trapping methods such as impaction, straining, diffusion, interception, and electrostatic forces, the HEPA filtration process actually has an efficiency >99.97% for removing particles both larger and smaller than 0.3 \u00b5m. For a detailed description of selection, installation, and use of this equipment, the reader is referred to appendix a in the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th edition.

When the application of administrative and engineering controls and work practices is not sufficient to protect against exposure, PPE is used to provide an additional and/or redundant layer of protection. The goal of PPE is two\u2010fold: (1) PPE provides a barrier to possible routes of entry on a worker's body and (2) PPE protects street clothing and shoes so that laboratory contaminants are not inadvertently taken from the laboratory into a nonresearch area, such as a worker's home. The use of protective clothing such as buttoned labcoats or back\u2010closing gowns and gloves are commonplace in today's research laboratory. The use of these items is appropriate even during research of minimal biosafety concern. Face protection, such as a face shield or a combination of goggles plus a surgical mask afford protection to the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. In certain circumstances, shoe or hair covers may be required. The use of respirators may be required in settings where airborne transmission is possible. (Note: any use of respiratory protection must follow an institutional Respiratory Protection Program. Institutional industrial hygienists or environmental health professionals must be consulted prior to using a respirator). PPE must be selected carefully for the work to be performed. For example, most gloves are suitable for creating a barrier against biological agents, but they may not be compatible with research chemicals. Some materials found in PPE may contain allergens, such as latex, that can stimulate health problems for allergic personnel. PPE must be put on (donned) in the laboratory and removed (doffed) prior to leaving the work area. Taking off PPE must be performed carefully to avoid contaminating skin or street clothes. Laboratory personnel must not launder labcoats or other reusable PPE at home.",

This waste can be autoclaved at the laboratory or collected for treatment by the institution or a contractor prior to final disposal. It must be verified that autoclaves and other treatment methods inactivate biological organisms through periodic validation tests with biological indicators.
