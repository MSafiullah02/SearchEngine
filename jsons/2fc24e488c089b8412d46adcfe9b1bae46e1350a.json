A high peak that exceeded capacity, specifically the availability of intensive care beds and ventilators, would limit access to appropriate healthcare and result in otherwise preventable deaths. The steps to \"flatten the curve\" are intended to slow viral transmission in order to delay the onset of enough cases to lower the peak and spread the distribution of cases over time, not specifically to prevent the overall incidence of cases during the pandemic. Although the principal intent of \"flatten the curve\" is to delay infections and diminish the health impact by spreading the burden on hospitals and infrastructure over time, not specifically to prevent infections, it could ultimately relieve the burden and impact by buying time until effective treatments were developed, and also facilitate prevention if an effective vaccine were developed, though for COVID-19 a vaccine might take months at the earliest.",

These actions have quarantined not just patients with COVID-19, which may be justified on a public health basis, but also in effect quarantined the healthy. influenza in many ways, and the mortality from this first wave of COVID-19 already exceeds the typical annual mortality usually associated with influenza. The medical impact of COVID-19 is different, is part because the epidemiology and spread of a new pathogen through a non-immune population is different from influenza. More striking has been the societal and governmental response to COVID-19 compared to influenza. Why has the response to COVID-19 been so different than for influenza, including the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009? It seems that the novelty of a new virus, with a unique name and identity, as opposed to \"just the flu,\" has been one factor. Another significant factor has been the attention, and sometimes hysteria, resulting from the heightened presence of social media and also the mainstream media. Many voices are heard, and not all are informed. Many media voices are unfiltered.",

The definition of \"essential\" and \"non-essential\" applied by state governments varied, and in many instances appeared arbitrary, closing outdoor parks while permitting liquor stores to remain open and lottery sales to continue.

We do have some experiences from past pandemics, but the government actions during those pandemics are not comparable to the current actions taken by state governors. The most serious pandemic, in 1918, was in a societal and economic environment very different from the United States in 2020, and the more recent 2009 H1N1pdm09 influenza pandemic was not as deadly. It is misleading to state that the decisions are \"science-led\" and \"data-driven\" when in fact the \"data\" are experiences, not experiments.

For the present, we need to realize that what was stated in 2007 remains true today: \"Evidence to determine the best strategies for protecting people during a pandemic is very limited. Retrospective data from past epidemics and the conclusions drawn from those data need to be examined and analyzed within the context of modern society\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 1 where there is data and where there is not.

For example, a preliminary analysis of cases in New York City shows that the incidence reached an inflection point around the date that the state initiated the lockdown (Harris, 2020).[5] Some states in the United States are taking far less draconian measures and have fared better than some states taking extreme restrictions. Florida, for example, did not impose statewide closure of non-essential businesses but left early lockdown decisions to local authorities. It is unknown how much mandatory state-imposed restrictions add to the impact of voluntary actions taken by the citizenry in the face of a pandemic.
