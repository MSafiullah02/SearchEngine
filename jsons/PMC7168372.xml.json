The RNA was reverse transcribed at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by inactivation of reverse transcriptase and denaturation of cDNA template at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min.

In addition, excluding the strains isolated from Chinese dogs (Ca/HKU_Ca035F and Ca/HKU_Ca026F) whose genogroups have not yet been identified 29, the homologies of these three isolates with known CaNoV and FeNoV (75.9\u201392.3%) were higher than those with GIV HuNoV (59.1\u201365.9%), indicating that the present three isolates form a clade with known CaNoVs and FeNoVs that differs from that of HuNoVs in the phylogenetic tree. It has been suggested that NoV has been circulating among dogs 30; the findings of the present study support this, as described above. However, the homologies of the two NoV isolates with known CaNoVs ranged from 77.3 to 91.8% even within the same clade, suggesting the presence of several lineages within the CaNoV genogroups, as described previously 9, 10. Although only a small number of FeNoV strains have been characterized, the homologies observed between the present feline NoV isolate (Fe/Saitama382/2013/JP) and previous cat\u2010 and lion\u2010derived isolates (CU081210E and Pistoia1387) were extremely high (91.7\u201392.3%), suggesting the presence of a unique circulation of NoV in the Felidae that differs from that in dogs.",

CaNoV, FeNoV and CaSaV may have an infection cycle in each animal species or family. However, the potential for human infection by some types of NoV and SaV in dogs and cats cannot be ruled out, because of the following observations: (i) GII NoV, which is the most prevalent human NoV, has been detected from dogs 15; (ii) GIV and GVI NoVs, which are the main genogroups in dogs and cats, have been detected in humans 9, 11; and (iii) antibodies against GVI NoV have been detected in human sera 17.",

In the present study, we were unable to clarify the pathogenicity of NoVs and SaVs in dogs and cats, because mixed infections with CPV\u20102 or FPLV, which are the most virulent causes of diarrhea in dogs and cats, were noted in all five samples in which NoV or SaV was detected. In previous studies, most dogs infected with CaNoV were approximately 2\u20133 months old 13, 30. A high CaNoV prevalence has been reported in kennels 31. All four dogs in which NoV and SaV were detected in the present study were also 2 months old and purebred, suggesting that CaNoV and CaSaV infections likely also occur in environments where puppies and kittens are ordinarily kept, such as pet shops and breeding colonies.",

Although FCV is a representative pathogen for upper respiratory tract, it has been demonstrated not only in laryngopharyngeal secretions but also in feces 32. Although FCV, which replicates in the upper respiratory epithelial cells, potentially passes through the alimentary tract and is excreted in the feces, a difference in resistance to bile salts has been observed between FCV isolates from respiratory secretions and feces, suggesting the presence of enterocyte\u2010infecting FCV 32. No other diarrheagenic viruses were detected in one FCV\u2010positive sample (Fe/Tokyo671/2013/JP), and only FCoV\u2010I, which generally causes no or mild symptoms of intestinal infections when it infects alone, was detected in three samples (Fe/Yamaguchi165/2011/JP, Fe/Saitama1650/2013/JP and Fe/Osaka210/2013/JP).
