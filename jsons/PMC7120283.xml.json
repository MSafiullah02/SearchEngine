            "text": "The expected global population by 2050 will be approximately 9.1 billion (High-Level Expert Forum, FAO, October 2009; http://www.fao.org). To nourish the ever-increasing population, food production has to be increased simultaneously. Use of latest techniques in plant genetic engineering could help to increase the production of food crops. A range of different expression platforms have been used for heterologous production of foreign proteins having pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications (Demain and Vaishnav 2009). Among different production platforms, plants have been used as highly economical and scalable production systems for the expression of recombinant proteins, enzymes, and valuable metabolites. Plastid transformation technology has attracted strong interest for different applications in plant biology owing to several advantages compared to conventional nuclear transformation (Adem et al. 2017). The high ploidy number of chloroplast genome and compartmentalization of proteins allow high levels of foreign protein accumulation. Recombinant proteins are reported to accumulate up to several folds in total leaf soluble protein in plastids (Daniell et al. 2009a, b; Oey et al. 2009; Bock 2015). Plastid genomes are inherited through the maternal parent and thus provide a strong level of biological containment thus avoiding several ethical concerns. Integration of transgene proceeds via homologous recombination and is therefore highly precise and predictable (Verma and Daniell 2007). Another important feature of plastid transformation is that genetic machinery in chloroplast is devoid of gene silencing and other epigenetic mechanisms that interfere with stable transgene expression (Wani et al. 2010; Bock 2014). Recent advancement in plastid transformation is reviewed in (Kumar et al. 2017). In this chapter, we highlight the impact of chloroplast genome engineering on various plant biology applications. Advancement of chloroplast engineering for improving agronomic traits and plastids as platform for production high-value proteins for biofuel production is discussed.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, plastome lacks recombination and exhibits a uniparental (maternal) inheritance. Conventionally, plastome sequencing was based on cloning of plastid DNA fragments to generate DNA libraries followed by long-range PCR. Alternatively a large set of DNA primers were used to amplify and sequence overlapping DNA fragments in plastid genome. With the rapid advancement in next-generation sequencing technology, it is becoming increasingly faster and cheaper to sequence and assemble plastomes. Although different sequencing platforms are available, Illumina and PacBio systems are widely used for sequencing of plastid genome and subsequent assembly (Chen et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2015; Jackman et al. 2016). However, several groups have reported reads generated through PacBio are often low (English et al. 2012). This was later improved by use of latest sequencing chemistry together with a hierarchical genome assembly process algorithm (Daniell et al. 2016).",

Till date, ~650 plant species have their plastid genome sequence publically available in GenBank database. Plastome of two rice varieties (Oryza sativa indica and O. sativa japonica) were sequenced, and authors reported that divergence of plastome of both varieties occurred approximately 86,000 to 200,000 years ago (Tang et al. 2004). Tong et al. (2016) reported variation in chloroplast genome of rice ecotypes from Asia and Africa. Sequencing of plastid genomes of wild rice Oryza australiensis and Zizania latifolia gave insights about evolution of rice varieties (Wu and Ge 2016; Zhang et al. 2016). Plastomes of wheat, rye, barley, and other Triticeae species were sequenced using Roche/454 technology. Sequence alignments revealed exchange of genetic material by translocation of segment of plastome to the nuclear genome specific to rye/wheat lineage (Middleton et al. 2014). Kim et al. (2014) reported AT-rich plastid genome in orchid Cypripedium japonicum and proposed importance of AT residues in effective splicing of the plastid genome. Plastome analysis of banana Musa acuminate revealed IR/SSC expansion occurred independently multiple times in monocots during course of evolution (Martin et al. 2013).",

Plastid genome analysis of several parasitic plants revealed evolutionary reduction in genome size is associated with gene loss (Funk et al. 2007; Gruzdev et al. 2016). It has been proposed that DNA in plastid loci could be horizontally acquired from its host as a result of parasitism (Molina et al. 2014). This is further supported by that finding that plasmodesmatal continuity between partners allows movement of genetic material (Birschwilks et al. 2006; Roney et al. 2007; Talianova and Janousek 2011). Thus comparative plastome analysis revealed information about simplification of plastid gene expression machinery in parasitic plants. The availability of the complete plastid genome sequence for several plant species facilitated generation of novel plastid expression vectors for efficient foreign gene expression in plants through utilization of endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory elements.",

Nevertheless, progress of plastid transformation in agriculturally relevant crops like cereals and monocots is in its infancy (Maliga and Bock 2011; Rigano et al. 2012; Bock 2014).

For heterologous production of E7 in tobacco plastids, the expression of E7 as a translational fusion to \u03b2-glucuronidase enzyme was attempted. In addition, redirection of E7 into thylakoid lumen was also tried. The use of \u03b2-glucuronidase as a fusion protein turned out to be a successful strategy for improving E7 accumulation, and recombinant proteins accumulated ~40 times relative to unfused E7 (Morgenfeld et al. 2014). A high-risk HPV-16 candidate therapeutic vaccine (LALF32\u201351-E7) was developed by plastid targeting and resulted in 27-fold higher expression compared to cytosolic targeting in Nicotiana benthamiana. The authors proposed plastids-based production could be a more affordable therapeutic vaccine for HPV-16 (Yanez et al. 2018). Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) accelerates cell proliferation and differentiation and hence possesses wide clinical applications. A codon-optimized bFGF gene was transformed to tobacco chloroplasts, and recombinant protein accumulation was observed (Wang et al. 2015). Serum antibodies developed in hemophilia B patients against coagulation factor IX (FIX) is highly challenging to eliminate due to nephrotic syndrome after continued infusion. Su et al. (2015) fused FIX with a transmucosal carrier (CTB) in lettuce chloroplast, and recombinant proteins accumulated up to ~1 mg/g. Moreover it was also demonstrated that feeding transgenic lettuce to hemophilia B mice delivered CTB-FIX effectively and not only induced LAP(+) regulatory T-cells but also suppressed IgE formation, anaphylaxis against FIX.",

            "text": "Overproduction of industrially important enzymes through conventional nuclear transformation has met with little success as many reports suggest that recombinant enzymes can negatively affect transgenic plant growth and development. A gene encoding thermostable xylanase enzyme from Bacillus sp. when overexpressed in tobacco resulted in accumulation of xylanase up to 6% of the total soluble protein (Leelavathi et al. 2003). Similarly, Kim et al. (2011) demonstrated GH10 xylanase Xyl10B from Thermotoga maritima expressed in plastids exhibited high stability and catalytic activities. Further, endoglucanases like endo-\u03b2-1,4-xylanase and \u03b2-glucosidase expressed in tobacco plastids accumulated more than 75% of total soluble proteins. Subsequent bioconversion experiments confirmed that plastid-derived enzymes were able to hydrolyze industrially pretreated giant reed biomass (Castiglia et al. 2016). Pyrococcus horikoshii hyperthermostable archaeal \u03b2-1,4-endoglucanase expressed in tobacco plastids produced high levels of active enzymes that were even recovered from dry tissues (Nakahira et al. 2013). Another study reported transplastomic plants expressing four different thermostable cell wall-degrading enzymes from Thermobifida fusca accumulated up to 40% of total soluble protein. However, transplastomic lines exhibited pigment-deficient phenotypes (Petersen and Bock 2011). Klinger et al. (2015) proposed that enzymes of prokaryotic origin are efficiently expressed in plants than in a bacterial production platform. Espinoza-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2015) expressed pectin lyase and manganese peroxidase in tobacco plastids and recombinant enzymes exhibited improved enzyme activity. In another study, it was demonstrated that thermostable cellulases (Cel6A and Cel6B) from Thermobifida fusca expressed in tobacco chloroplasts were able to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose (Yu et al. 2007).",

These polymers are often used in soft tissue augmentation and regeneration. A synthetic PBP was targeted to both nucleus and plastids. It was confirmed that PBP transcripts accumulated up to 100-fold higher in transplastomic lines compared to nuclear transgenic plants (Guda et al. 2000). Despite the diversion of major metabolic pathway intermediate, metabolic engineering using chloroplast genomes led to production of several bioplastics. Bacterial genes encoding the polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) pathway encoding enzymes were expressed in tobacco plastome. Transplastomic lines produced ~18.8% dry weight PHB (Bohmert-Tatarev et al. 2011). Another study reported expression of Ralstonia eutropha polyhydroxybutyrate operon in plastids and transplastomic lines produced biodegradable PHB (Mozes-Koch et al. 2017). Engineering chloroplast genome resulted in advancement of different biotechnological applications including production of thermostable industrial enzymes, biomaterials, and immunologicals. Nonetheless, how many of these will be approved for commercial level production and will reach market is still a matter of debate.",

With the growing interest in biofuels, enzyme cocktails that can digest lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars have gained much attention. A major breakthrough in biofuel production was the report from Verma et al. (2010) about chloroplast-derived enzyme cocktails for the production of fermentable sugars from different sources of lignocellulosic materials. The authors reported that cost of plastid-derived endoglucanase was estimated to be ~3000-fold lower than for the same commercially available recombinant enzymes (Verma et al. 2010). Verma et al. (2013) demonstrated treatment of cotton fiber with plastid produced cutinase exhibited enlarged segments and the intertwined inner fibers due to activity of cutinase. In addition, recombinant protein showed improved esterase and lipase activity in addition to its cutinase activity. Endo- \u03b2-mannanase enzyme cocktail mixture derived from chloroplast exhibited 20% more glucose equivalents formation from pinewood compared to cocktail without mannanase (Agrawal et al. 2011). Verma et al. (2010) reported plastid-derived enzyme cocktails yielded more than 3625% glucose from substrates like citrus peel and pine wood than commercially available enzyme cocktails. Transplastomic plants accumulating cell wall-degrading enzymes will be an alternate and cheap renewable source of enzymes for the production of cellulosic ethanol in the near future.",

Poage et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and E.coli glutathione reductase through plastid transformation in tobacco. The transformed lines exhibited increased radical scavenging activity thereby increasing tolerance to heavy metal stress and UV-B radiation. Expression of genes involved in secondary metabolites production has been demonstrated through plastid transformation. Tocochromanol pathway is introduced to plastids as single gene constructs into tobacco and tomato plants which resulted in tenfold higher accumulation of tocochromanol compared to controls (Lu et al. 2013). Plastomic transformation of acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene which catalyzes the first step in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis into the Arabidopsis thaliana conferred resistance against herbicides such as pyrimidinylcarboxylate and imidazolinon (Shimizu et al. 2008). Overexpression of cry9Aa2 (insecticidal protein) in chloroplasts of tobacco plants conferred resistance against Phthorimaea operculella (potato tuber moth), but this higher expression of protein delayed plant growth and development (Chakrabarti et al. 2006). Similarly, expression of cry1Ac protein through chloroplast transformation in rice resulted in enhanced resistance against common pests of rice skipper and caterpillar (Kim et al. 2009). In another study, transformation of Pseudomonas pyrrocinia chloroperoxidase when expressed in tobacco plastids not only resulted in accumulation of recombinant protein but also improved resistance toward Alternaria Alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium sp., and Verticillium sp.

Expression of different genes including \u03b2-carotene ketolase, \u03b2-carotene hydroxylase, and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase from marine bacteria in lettuce plastome led to accumulation of astaxanthin fatty acid esters (Harada et al. 2014).Vitamin E (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4-tocopherols) are lipid-soluble antioxidants. Tocopherol biosynthetic machinery in plastids utilized precursors derived from two different metabolic pathways, homogentisic acid, an intermediate of shikimate pathway, and phytyldiphosphate, intermediate from methylerythritol phosphate pathway (Lushchak and Semchuk 2012). Expression of \u03b3-tocopherol methyltransferase (\u03b3-TMT) and tocopherol cyclase (TC) in tobacco and lettuce plastids resulted in improved \u03b1-tocopherol levels (Yabuta et al. 2013). Plastome expression of homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), TC, and \u03b3-TMT confirmed HPT as the rate-limiting enzymatic step in tocopherol biosynthesis (Lu et al. 2013). Wurbs et al. (2007) demonstrated plastid expression of a bacterial lycopene \u03b2-cyclase in tomato-mediated conversion of lycopene to \u03b2-carotene and resulted in fourfold enhanced provitamin A content in fruits. Apel and Bock (2009) produced transplastomic tomato by overexpressing \u03b2-cyclase that resulted in an increase of up to 50% in provitamin A. Further, transplastomic plants accumulated ~50% increase in total carotenoid, and this could be possible by enhancing the flux through the pathway in chromoplasts. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of chloroplast engineering for production of high-value metabolites in plastid biofactories.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used for the first time to engineer the chloroplast genome by Jin et al. (2015). A lepidopteran chitin synthase (Chi), cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), and V-ATPase were used as RNAi targets by the above group of researchers. In insects feeding assay in leaves of transplastomic lines, CYP450, Chi, and V-ATPase siRNAs, transcript levels were reduced to undetectable levels in insect midgut. In addition, net weight of the larvae and their growth and pupation were significantly reduced indicating success of technology. Zhang et al. (2015) introduced dsRNA via the chloroplast genome to target the insect \u03b2-actin gene and to subsequently elicit resistance against potato beetle. Transgenic potato lines producing dsRNAs targeted against the \u03b2-actin gene of the Colorado potato beetle, a deadlier agricultural pest, were successful. Chloroplast expression of long dsRNAs provided protection of potato lines without application of chemical pesticides. A construct encoding \u223c200-nucleotide duplex-stemmed-hairpin (hp) RNAs, targeting the cholinesterase gene of Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bull worm), was targeted to both nuclear and plastid genome of N. benthamiana. Undiced, full-length hairpin RNAs (hpRNA) accumulated in N. benthamiana and conferred strong protection against H. armigera herbivory (Bally et al. 2016). Overall, successful expression of dsRNAs through plastome engineering opens the great possibility of using RNAi approaches to confer desired agronomic traits in plants.",

            "text": "Engineering of plastid genome has taken a huge leap in plant biology owing to several advantages over nuclear genome engineering. In addition, recent availability of plastid genome sequence of many plants resulted in broadening the host range just from tobacco and lettuce to other crops like tomato, carrot, potato, cotton, soybean, etc. Despite the several advancements made in plastid transformation, there are still several major concerns that need to be addressed. One of the main disadvantages of plastome engineering is related to post-translational modification. Plastids lack the necessary machinery to glycosylate proteins, and absence of glycosylation is one of the major bottlenecks for the proper folding and functioning of glycoproteins like antibodies. Another major concern is stability of recombinant proteins in plastids. Chloroplast stroma contains several proteases that could degrade recombinant proteins produced. The expression of transgenes in non-green plastids is not as efficient as in green plastids (chloroplasts), and challenges related to poor gene expression in non-green plastid are still a major concern. Although the last two decades witnessed expression of a large number of vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins in plastids (Table 4.2), hardly any chloroplast-made proteins completed clinical trials. This is due to the strict regulatory and IP issues related to the use of plant-made proteins for human consumption. Nevertheless, addressing some of the above concerns could lead to a new paradigm in plastome engineering and could contribute for the development of sustainable production of therapeutic proteins and industrial enzyme in plastids for human consumption and commercial exploitation, respectively.",
