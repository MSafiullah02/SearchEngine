Confirmed cases have commonly been measured by rates of positive findings among persons who have been tested for infection. Infection data are missing for persons who have not been tested. It is also well-appreciated that the persons who have been tested differ considerably from those who have not been tested. Criteria used to determine who is eligible for testing typically require demonstration of symptoms associated with presence of infection or close contact with infected persons. This gives considerable reason to believe that some fraction of untested persons are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 disease. Presuming this is correct, the actual cumulative rate of infection has been higher than the reported rate.",

It is important to distinguish nasal swab tests from serological tests. Nasal swab tests are used to detect the presence of live virus within a person, signaling an active infection. Serological tests are used to detect the presence of antibodies that the immune system develops after onset of infection. The presence of antibodies signals that a person was infected at some past date and shows that the body has subsequently produced detectable antibodies.",

Study of partial identification analysis removes the focus on point estimation obtained under strong assumptions. Instead it begins by posing relatively weak assumptions that should be highly credible in the applied context under consideration. Such weak assumptions generally imply set-valued estimates rather than point estimates. Strengthening the initial weak assumptions shrinks the size of the implied set estimate. The formal methodological problem is to determine the set estimate that logically results when available data are combined with specified assumptions.

The former is the positive predictive value (PPV) and the latter is one minus the negative predictive value (NPV). We note that medical researchers and clinicians often measure test accuracy in a different way, through test sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of tests for COVID-19 on the tested sub-population are P(Rd= 1|Td=1, Cd=1) and P(Rd = 0|Td=1, Cd=0) respectively. Sensitivity and specificity are related to PPV and NPV through Bayes Theorem, whose application generally requires knowledge of P(Cd= 1|Td=1), the infection rate in the tested sub-population. An exception to this generalization is that PPV equals one if specificity equals one, whenever sensitivity is positive and P(Cd= 1|Td=1) > 0.4\n",

For example, USA Today has reported as follows5\n: \u201cDwayne Breining, executive director for Northwell Labs in New Hyde Park, New York, said the test is extremely accurate and can detect even low levels of the virus. False positives are highly unlikely, he said, though false negatives may result from poor-quality swabs or if the instrument is blocked by mucus. Those factors might have been at play in a number of false negatives initially reported. Patients who continue to have symptoms after a negative test are advised to get retested\u201d. We therefore find it credible to assume that P(Cd= 1|Rd=1) = 1. It can be shown that this is equivalent to assuming that test specificity P(Rd= 0|Td=1, Cd=0) = 1. The final sentence of the Breining quote explains part of why it may not be completely accurate to assume that persons are tested at most once.
