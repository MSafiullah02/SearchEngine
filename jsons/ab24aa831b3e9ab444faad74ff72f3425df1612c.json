Our objective was to compare health and performance of PC or AM management systems with (PI) or without (CON) presence of a PI-BVDV pen mate using a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement. Four shipment blocks of crossbred PC steers (n = 236) from 3 ranch-origins were weaned, dewormed, vaccinated, tested for PI-BVDV, and kept on the ranch for \u226542 d. Subsequently, PC steers were transported to a stocker receiving unit (RU), weighed (251 \u00b1 2 kg), blood sampled, stratifi ed by d \u22121 BW, and assigned randomly to treatment (PCPI or PCCON) with no additional processing. Simultaneously, 4 blocks of crossbred AM calves (n = 292) were assembled from regional auction markets and transported to the RU \u00b1 36 h from PC arrival. The AM calves were weighed (245 \u00b1 1.3 kg), stratifi ed by gender and d \u22121 BW, processed under the same regimen used for PC steers at their origin ranch except bull calves were castrated, and then assigned randomly to treatment (AMPI or AMCON). Treatment pens (0.45 ha) were arranged spatially such that PI did not have fence-line or water source contact with CON. Calves were fed identically and followed the same antibiotic treatment protocol. Daily BW gain for the entire 42-d receiving trial was greater (P < 0.001) for PC (1.2 kg) compared with AM (0.85 kg). There was an exposure effect (P = 0.002) on ADG from d 28 to 42; CON gained 1.12 kg vs. 0.90 kg BW for PI cohort. Morbidity was markedly greater (P < 0.001) in AM (70%) vs. PC (7%), resulting in (P < 0.001) an antibiotic treatment cost of $20.52 and $2.48/animal, respectively. Treatment with a third antibiotic occurred more often (P = 0.04) for PI cohort, and the percentage of chronically ill cattle was greatest (P = 0.06) for AMPI. Upon arrival, BVDV type 1a, 1b, and 2a titers were greater for PC (treatment \u00d7 day, P < 0.001), and the percentage seropositive to BVDV type 1a on d 0 was 100% for PC vs. 23% in AM. Platelets increased transiently (P < 0.001) with greater platelets observed in AM (P < 0.001). Results indicate that PC calves gain faster and require fewer antibiotic treatments during the receiving period.

Our observation of improved performance for preconditioned calves is in agreement with other reports in the literature. Step et al.

Performance from d 0 to 28 was not affected (P = 0.10) by PI-BVDV exposure in our trial; nevertheless, during the initial weeks of our study, PI-BVDV animals may have unintentionally served as a trainer animal because they had been previously acclimated to the RU. In a series of 4 trials, Loerch and Fluharty (2000) observed increases in eating behavior and variable ADG for newly received calves with a trainer cow present in the pen during the initial 14 d, but overall (28-d) differences in growth were undetectable in 3 of 4 trials. Another consideration is that short-term exposure to a low-virulent BVDV strain from a PI pen mate could imitate an unattenuated autogenous vaccination resulting in undetectable or small performance differences during the initial weeks of PI-BVDV exposure. However, as PI-BVDV exposure continued, a progressive effect on host immune activity or infl ammation may have resulted in the performance loss observed from d 28 to 42 because repeated immune stimulation results in nutrients being preferentially used for immune and homeostatic pathways rather than tissue deposition (Klasing and Korver, 1997; Spurlock, 1997) . Furthermore, the catabolic effects of proinfl ammatory cytokine stimulation from continuous PI-BVDV exposure may have inhibited growth (Johnson, 1997) from d 28 to 42 in our study. Therefore, performance consequences in newly received cohorts exposed to a PI-BVDV pen mate may be delayed several weeks because immunomodulation resulting from PI-BVDV exposure and these potential effects on growth is progressive. Alternatively, the immunomodulatory effects of PI-BVDV exposure may have a more indirect effect on growth via increased susceptibility of cohorts to complicated infections with other viruses or bacteria involved in BRD, thereby, decreasing health and performance (Gardner et al., 1999) . Nevertheless, our ADG results suggest there may be a signifi cant metabolic cost associated with continuous exposure to a PI animal shedding a low-virulence BVDV strain. The performance loss may not be immediate but rather several weeks subsequent when nutrients used for humoral and cell-mediated immunity or when catabolic effects of proinfl ammatory cytokine stimulation associated with repeated BVDV exposure presumably reach a threshold effect on growth performance. Because BW measurements were not recorded beyond the 42-d receiving period, the duration of performance loss and whether there was compensatory gain during the fi nishing phase is unknown and warrants further investigation. Published research evaluating PI-BVDV exposure effects on performance is both limited and confl icting; therefore, additional studies with careful consideration of management and health history of experimental cattle, differences in the virulence and subgenotype strain of PI-BVDV challenge animals, and epidemiological factors are required to determine effects of PI-BVDV exposure on performance throughout the various stages of the beef production system. Furthermore, a better understanding of metabolic responses to physiological alteration and immunomodulation from PI-BVDV exposure is needed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 316, "text": "Hessman et al.

Furthermore, a greater percentage of AM calves required treatment with a second (P < 0.001) or third (P = 0.001) antibiotic. Our observations of a management effect on BRD morbidity were similar to Clark et al. (2006) in which BRD morbidity rates were 64.4 and 2.0% in steers considered either high-or low-risk for developing signs of BRD, respectively. Other studies (Macartney et al., 2003; Seeger et al., 2008) reported that calves of unknown health history had greater morbidity compared with those administered health protocols before marketing. Similarly, Roeber et al. (2001) observed that cattle originating from a preconditioning program had fewer hospital visits than cattle originating from auction markets. Step et al. (2008) reported morbidity being 11.1% for ranch-origin and 41.9% for auction-market calves. Within the ranchorigin calves, those weaned and shipped directly to the feedlot had greater morbidity compared with those kept on the ranch 45 d; however, vaccination with a MLV respiratory vaccine at weaning did not reduce morbidity during the receiving period among the 2 treatments kept on the ranch 45 d. This observation may suggest that weaning management had a more profound effect on re- ducing subsequent morbidity than did administration of a MLV respiratory vaccine. Antibiotic treatment cost during the 42-d receiving period was increased (P < 0.001) for AM ($20.52/animal) compared with PC ($2.48/animal). Moreover, the percentage of chronically ill cattle was greater (P = 0.03) for AM. The differences observed for health variables among the 2 cattle management sources in the current study with supporting evidence from recent research would suggest clearly that single-source PC calves have fewer BRD-related health problems, improved animal well-being, and reduced antibiotic usage compared with commingled AM calves of unknown management and health history. Nevertheless, the improved health parameters observed for PC vs. AM in the current study cannot be attributed solely to preconditioning management because PC calves were not commingled or subjected to the auction market system (Taylor et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 530, "text": "Clark et al.

The AMPI had 9.5% more calves treated thrice than AMCON, whereas PCPI had only 1.7% more calves treated thrice than PCCON. A treatment interaction (P = 0.06) was observed for the percentage of chronically ill animals; AMPI had the greatest number of chronically ill calves (7.6%), AMCON was intermediate (1.1%), and PCCON and PCPI were least (0.4 and 0.3%, respectively). This observation suggests that weaning management and exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate affect health additively because percentage of chronically ill was greatest for AMPI, with no difference among PCCON and PCPI. A numerical, but not statistical difference (P = 0.10), was observed for PI-BVDV-exposed cohorts having an increased antibiotic treatment cost which averaged $12.59 and $10.40/animal for PI and CON, respectively. Within AM cohorts, AMPI had an antibiotic treatment cost of $4.06/animal more than AMCON; this numerical increase was similar to the estimated PI-BVDV testing cost ($4.25/sample including next day parcel service fees). Our observations among AMPI and AMCON agree with another study using high-risk calves of unknown history (Hessman et al., 2009) in that overall morbidity was not different for direct PI-exposed or unexposed groups; however, percentage of fi rst relapse, chronic illness, and fatalities were greater for the direct PI-exposed groups. In that trial, treatment cost/animal was not statistically different (P = 0.24), but a numerical increase of $1.19/animal was observed for direct PIexposed groups. Loneragan et al. (2005) determined that cattle exposed to a PI-BVDV animal had a 43% greater risk of initial BRD treatment and clinically ill cattle with a PI-BVDV animal in the pen were administered more antibiotic treatments than non-exposed pens (1.76 vs. 1.46). Conversely, Booker et al. (2008) observed no differences in BRD health among PI-and non-PI-exposed pens, whereas O'Conner et al. (2005) observed that disease prevalence was reduced in pens containing lowrisk, single-source cattle with a PI-BVDV calf present. Elam et al. (2008) used low-risk, preconditioned heifers that also received antibiotic metaphylaxis on-arrival and reported no difference in health with either short-(60 h) or long-term (duration of study) exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate. Their observation of no health differences for PI-exposed cohorts using low-risk, preconditioned heifers would agree with our observation of few health differences between PCCON and PCPI treatments. In a feedlot study using auction-derived cattle (Stevens et al., 2007) , morbidity was increased for pens with shortterm (13 to 18 d) exposure to PI-BVDV. Conversely, a subsequent study conducted in the same feedlot facility (Stevens et al., 2009) in which the PI animal was removed more rapidly (\u2264d 2) and overall morbidity and mortality were considerably less, initial BRD treatment was reduced for PI-exposed pens.

The difference in antibody titers against BVDV type 1a on d 0 suggests that AM calves were relatively na\u00efve, and PC calves had greater humoral immune protection against BVDV challenge.

Previous serological data (Martin et al., 1999; O'Connor et al., 2001) also indicate that greater serum antibody titers against BVDV upon arrival at the feedlot correspond with a subsequent reduction in risk for clinical BRD.
