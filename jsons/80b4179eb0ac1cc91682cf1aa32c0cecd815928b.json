Virosphere forms the shadow of this cell-based tree of life: completely dependent on the tree for existence, yet, the tree is equally unable to escape its ever evolving companion. How important role has the shadow played in the evolution of life? Is it a mere ethereal partner or a constitutive factor? In this chapter four puzzles in virus research are taken under the scope in order to probe some of the intriguing ways by which viruses can help us understand life on Earth. These puzzles consider the origin of genetic information in viruses, viruses as symbiotic partners, the structural diversity of viruses and the role of viruses in the origin of cellular life. More than providing answers, this introduction exempli fi es how viruses can be approached from various angles and how each of the angles can open up new ways to appreciate their potential contributions to life.",

Yet, while being relatively simple in comparison to cells, there is much that we do not know about viruses or their roles in evolutionary processes. Viruses have been here for a long time (Forterre and Prangishvili 2009a ) , and studies suggest that viruses appear to have played a part in events such as the origin of cellular life ) and the evolution of mammals (Gifford 2012 ) .

The heart of the issue lies in the notion that a virus often refers only to the protein-formed protective capsid, which encloses viral genomic information in the extracellular environment (see discussion in Jacob and Wollman 1961 ; Forterre and Prangishvili 2009b ; Villarreal and Witzany 2010 ; Moreira and L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda 2009 ; Jalasvuori 2012 ) . This infectious particle is known as a virion and they are generally regarded to be dead (in many depressingly unfruitful discussions). Virions are entities that intrude and assume the control of cellular organisms in order to produce more virions. But should this dead virion actually be considered equal to a virus? And what then would a virus be, if not a virion? The seemingly trivial difference between a virus and a virion needs to be tackled as it allows us to appreciate viruses as evolutionary players, or even as living organisms (Forterre and Prangishvili 2009b ; Villarreal and Witzany 2010 ; Forterre 2011 ; Jalasvuori 2012 ) . In any case and regardless of our opinions on their living status, viruses are part of the evolving biosphere and therefore a relevant factor in various evolutionary processes.",

Virus just is not dependent on any particular cell due to their capability transfer themselves from one cell to another via virions. And due to this extracellular form of existence, viruses are not terminated even if their replication causes the demise of the current host organism. However, jumping from this notion to the conclusion that viruses are dead and thus irrelevant partners of evolutionary processes is unwarranted. Naturally, our de fi nitions of viruses include the infectious extracellular part, but for thorough understanding of viral life it must be noted that any such de fi nitions are in the end arti fi cial. Virus is one of the ways by which genetic information have adapted to survive in this biosphere. From the viewpoint of cellular organisms, this way of struggle for existence is much more complex than the presence of chemical substances in the environment would be. Viruses, unlike poisons, are capable of evolving genetically and going extinct. Sometimes they can also form more or less permanent mutually bene fi ting relationships with their hosts. Now this perhaps more allowing perspective to viral life sets a more appropriate stage to consider any virus related puzzles. Each of the presented questions approach viruses from different angles and hopefully provide an intriguing introduction to the diversity of ways by which viruses may help us understand the evolution of our biosphere.

Do we need to sequence more bacterial genomes in order to fi nd the common ancestor form a cellular chromosome? Yet, as the number of sequenced bacterial chromosomes has increased, the number of unknown genes in viruses has remained unchanged (Forterre and Prangishvili 2009b ) . Sometimes when some rare types of virus genes are fi nally discovered from host chromosomes, it turns out that the genes in the chromosomes actually belong to genome integrated viruses ( Jalasvuori et al. , 2010 . Therefore the sequencing of bacterial chromosomes does not seem to provide an easy way out of the puzzle. Perhaps the genetic novelty of viruses is of genuine nature and there are no cellular homologies to be found. Or could it just be that the rapid evolutionary rates of genes in viruses is simply making the homology with cellular genes untraceable?",

Rather, it would mean that a virus, while replicating in a cell, ended up having an altered genetic sequence. This altered sequence opened the road for the emergence and evolution of a new gene. In practice the gene would form through point mutations and other genetic changes similarly with any other emerging genes (Forterre and Prangishvili 2009b ) . But if the new gene would emerge within a cell, is it not rather a cellular gene than a viral one (Moreira and L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda 2009 ) ? Doesn't this indeed only enforce the view of cellular origin of viral genetic information? No, it does not, if we allow ourselves to consider viruses to be more than just their encapsulated extracellular forms (Forterre 2010 ) . If the gene formed through mutations in a viral genome and the new gene was able to survive due to its bene fi ts to the virus and not to the host, then it would seem only reasonable to consider the gene to be of viral origin (Jalasvuori 2012 ) . Therefore, even if a cell serves the function of a vessel for the development of a new gene, the gene would remain in the global gene pool because of viruses. Eventually, when metagenomic studies, for example, are performed, these novel genes could be discovered from capsid enclosed genomes of viruses with no apparent counterparts in any cellular organisms.",

There are clear examples for this to be true. As a tragic example several viruses are known to cause the uncontrolled multiplication of human cells, which results in the formation of tumors. These virus-containing cells out-reproduce other human cells and thus they end up having much more descendants than the virus-free cells. Within this limited framework the virus-cell symbiotic can have the highest fi tness. But by extending our perspective we notice that this short-term bene fi t rapidly back fi res due to the demise of the hosting animal. The sel fi sh behavior of some cells leads to a tragedy of commons, where the gain of few is decreasing the fi tness of both host and the virus. Therefore, the real question is whether viruses and their hosts may form symbiotic relationship that can increase the fi tness of the whole organism within a large-enough evolutionary frame. In other words, we can ask, for example, if the virus-host symbiont could invade a population of virus-free hosts because of the advantages that the virus provides to its hosts.",

Therefore, among bacterial organisms such straightforward mutualistic relationships may emerge on regular basis (Roossinck 2011 ) . Moreover, the short-term bene fi t provided by the phage does not back fi re in the same sense as the spreading tumors do within animal hosts. But then, bacteria and humans are quite different in multiple respects.

            "text": "Bacteria are the most abundant type of a cellular organism on earth and their viruses are equally common. Bacteriophages almost exclusively form virions with a spherical head on which a tail is attached to. The head beholds the genetic information of the virus whereas the tail serves as a tool for attaching onto new host cells and, sometimes, as an injection needle during the infection process. This homologous group of viruses is known as Caudovirales (Ackermann 1998 ) . Other types of bacterial viruses also exist, but they are not many (Ackermann 2001 ) : there are icosahedral viruses with inner -and outer membranes, amorphous viruses and helical viruses (Oksanen et al. 2010 ) . Altogether, we have discovered only less than ten truly different types of virion-architectures from all currently known bacteriophages. What is this architectural conservation trying to tell us? Why are there not a 100 different types of bacterial viruses, or 100 billion types? Even if there were 100 billion unique types of viruses, each of them would still have over billion billion virions. And such a large number of individuals could indeed retain a stable population over evolutionary times. This, however, is not the case. You can calculate the virion architectures of bacteriophages with your fi ngers. Viruses are generally considered to be of polyphyletic origin, indicating that there are multiple viral ancestor and not a single common one. Still, the apparently limited number of architectural types suggests that new virus types are not emerging on regular basis, since, if they were, we would be likely to fi nd new viruses all the time. This leads to a question: when did these existing structural types emerge and why did they cease emerging?",

Later on similar viruses were found to infect thermophilic crenarchaea (Khayat et al. 2005 ) and reside in the genomes of thermophilic euryarchaea (Krupovic and Bamford 2008 ) . In terms of genetic exchange, the Archaeal phylum of Crenarchaeota consists of deep-branching organisms that appear to have been evolving relatively isolated from all other life forms since the emergence of cellular life (Gribaldo and Brochier-Armanet 2006 ) . Together these characteristics suggested that convergence appears to be an improbable cause to explain all the common features and thus it is reasonable to assume the existence of a common ancestor in some distant past.

These innovations could have helped the virus-like replicators to, for example, harness resources or synthesize useful biomolecules that, in turn, improved the reproductive rate of the virus themselves. Therefore, it is possible that some of the emerging genes were selected due to their bene fi ts on the survival of virus-like entities for very similar reasons as the novel genes in viral genomes may be doing even today.",

            "text": "Viruses also provide a possible explanation for the horizontal evolution of early life. This is because virions are essentially genetically encoded structures that mediate cell-to-cell transfer of genetic information. The different structural lineages of viruses, as discussed in the third question, may have emerged within this early community when selection favored any trait that allowed genetic information to get from one proto-cell to another. If the primordial system consisted of fi xed set of proto-cells, then fi tness of the replicator correlated to some extent with its capability to distribute itself to all potential proto-cells of the community. Isolated virus-free proto-cells may have been prone to collapse under replication parasites (Bresch et al. 1980 ; Szathm\u00e1ry and Demeter 1987 ) . Maybe the system survived such parasite epidemics by distributing the contents of healthy cells where virus-production did not succumb to aggressive replication of parasites. As the primordial system advanced, some of the fi rst viruses may have established more permanent residence in some of the proto-cells in a similar manner as was speculated in the second question. Could these viruses have prevented the overexploitation of cellular resources by sel fi sh parasites by providing genetic means to prevent other viruses to super infect these proto-cells? Did these mutualistic relationships between proto-cells and viruses clear the way for some of the proto-cells to become more independent from the rest of the genetic community? And did these increasingly independent cells eventually serve as ancestors of modern cellular lineages? Or are we completely lost here and in reality it was something completely different that produced our contemporary cells?",
