            "text": "In the life of piglets, weaning is a highly sensitive period related to the stressful withdrawal from the mother\u00b4s milk, which results in reduced immunity and a high prevalence of digestive infectious diseases. Such diseases are most commonly treated by use of the surface application of commercial antibiotics. Currently, natural substitutes of antibiotics, such as probiotics are preferred to be used for: the elimination of pathogenic/potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the gut (Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2012; Borovsk\u00e1 et al., 2013); the recovery of intestinal microflora, immunostimulation (Chytilov\u00e1 et al., 2013; Kuba\u0161ov\u00e1 and Mudro\u0148ov\u00e1, 2014); and the promotion of overall human and animal health without negative side effects. The effect of probiotics, for improved effectiveness, may be potentiated by special natural substrates used as prebiotics (Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2010). Suitable prebiotic substrates are, for example polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which are richly represented in flaxseed (Rodriguez-Leyva et al., 2010; Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2012; Andrej\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2016; Sopkov\u00e1 et al., 2017). Polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic (LA, C18:2 n-6) and \u03b1-linolenic (ALA, C18:3 n-3) acids are essential for humans and other animals. Since they are unable to be synthesised in these organisms, essential PUFAs have to be ingested from plants, fish oil, or algae (Tvrzick\u00e1 et al., 2009; Grofov\u00e1, 2010; \u017d\u00e1k et al., 2011). Flaxseed is the richest plant source of n-3 PUFA ALA which, together with its derivatives \u2013 eicosapentaenoic (EPA, C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, C22:6 n-3) acids are unique for their mostly pronounced cardioprotective (Rodriguez-Leyva et al., 2010), hypocholesterolemic (Sopkov\u00e1 et al., 2017), hepatoprotective (Andrej\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2016), anti-inflammatory (Liu et al., 2003) and neuroprotective (Contreras, 2012) effects on the organisms. They act via improved production of prostaglandins (PG) of series 3 suppressing the inflammation process (Rahbar et al., 2014). The positive effects of n-3 PUFAs have been substantiated by many researchers on the growth and adherence of lactobacilli in the gut (Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2012; Borovsk\u00e1 et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The PUFAs may affect the number of medium-sized follicles, as well as the conception and pregnancy rates in cows (Mattos et al., 2000; Petit et al., 2001). The hulls of flax seed are a rich source of lignan precursors (the most secoisolariciresinol diglycoside, SDG; Tourre and Xueming, 2010; Singh et al., 2011), which are converted by the gut bacteria into enterodiol and enterolacton having a similar chemical structure as an oestradiol-17\u03b2, thus acting like phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens can: bind to oestradiol receptors and act as an agonists or antagonists (Saggar et al., 2010; Michel et al., 2013), activate the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors (Bourque et al., 2012), modulate cell cycle and apoptosis influencing the reproduction (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015), and promote the health of humans (Ming et al., 2013; Yanagihara et al., 2014). Owing to their pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative properties (Rietjens et al., 2013; K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015), lignans of flaxseed have been studied as potentially useful agents in the hormone replacement therapy for decreasing menopausal symptoms (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013) and for the treatment of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer in women (Riediger et al., 2009). Moreover, flaxseed may directly modulate the release of progesterone and testosterone by prepubertal porcine ovarian granulosa cells (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015).",

Thus, there is evidence that the flaxseed effects could be mediated via the modulation of fatty acid metabolism or that they could relate to one another in some way; hence, this hypothesis requires further elucidation. Therefore, the aim of our in vivo experiment was to examine the influence of dietary flaxseed on the endocrine and ovarian functions of weanling gilts challenged with E. coli and Coronavirus infections treated with dietary probiotic cheeses (L. plantarum and L. fermentum strains) and also to understand the possible mechanisms of its effects to determine whether:",

Pigs were treated with probiotics 10 days before weaning (suckling period) and it lasted up until 14 days post-weaning to ensure their gut health.

Most authors dealing with the effects of flaxseed on the reproduction system suggest that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of flaxseed are the effects of its lignan phytoestrogens acting predominantly via the oestrogen receptors beta (Rietjens et al., 2013; Sirotkin and harrath, 2014; K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015). However, the preferential conversion of n-3 PUFAs instead of n-6 PUFAs (B\u00f6ttner et al., 2013) could have the same effect or they could relate to one another, although further elucidation of this action mechanism is needed. Whether the effects are the result of phytoestrogens was not studied in this experiment, although it should not be omitted. Our observations are the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that indicate that the feeding of flaxseed have such a positive correlation with the reproductive system of weanling gilts, as shown by ovarian cell apoptosis and proliferation, the metabolism of the fatty acids, as well as the response of the ovaries to such changes regarding the folliculogenesis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that dietary flaxseed supplementation can modify the cell cycle and apoptosis of ovarian cells via the action of highly unsaturated FAs (HUFAs) and SFAs after weaning and that this effect of dietary flaxseed can be inhibited during the suckling period of piglets.",

The flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet (long-term supplementation) revealed the suppressive effect of flaxseed on all types of follicles. This suppression could be due to the increased activation of apoptosis (accumulation of bax and caspase 3) and weaker proliferation (accumulation of PCNA) in the follicular cells, thus less follicles were recruited for other stages of development. The intensity of pro-apoptotic or anti-proliferative effect of flaxseed seems to depend on the length of flaxseed feeding or other dietary conditions (e.g. mother\u00b4s milk). Our findings of the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of flaxseed are in line with the in vitro studies on porcine ovarian healthy (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) and rat colon cancer cells (Hern\u00e1ndez-Salazar et al., 2013), as well as with studies performed in women with reproductive cancers who ate flaxseed (Riediger et al., 2009; Mcllwain et al., 2013); therefore flaxseed potentially inhibits ovarian follicle growth and development. In addition, there was significant inhibition of the proliferation marker cyclin B1, the promoter of G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Miyazaki and Arai, 2007) during the overall supplemental period. We also found the decrease in the level of eicosadienoic acid throughout the supplemental period and therefore we suggest, and this is the first report, that the inhibition of elongation of LA to eicosadienoic acid may block the G2/M phase of the cell cycle related to the low level of cyclin B1, but the mechanism is unknown. However, Xiong et al. (2015) found that enterolactone (a lignan metabolite) has an inhibitory effect on the expression of cyclin B1 in breast cancer cells, thus confirming the anti-proliferative effect of the flaxseed. The relations between eicosadienoic acid, cyclin B1 expression and phytoestrogens, as well as the possible mechanism of action should be studied further. Whether the block or activation of apoptosis could be due to the IGF-I action is debatable. IGF-I may mediate cellular survival by acting upstream of the caspase activation and may suppress or delay the initiation of the apoptotic process mainly via the type-I IGF receptor (Willis et al., 1998; Butt et al., 1999). In our study, the serum IGF-I level was increased regardless of the increase or decrease in DHA.",

            "text": "We found that flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet, as well as for flaxseed supplemented milk diet applied to prepubertal gilts resulted in high serum levels of LA but inhibited its conversion down its metabolic pathway (from DGLA to osbond acid). However the level of ALA (from flaxseed) was normal and its conversion to EPA and DHA was decreased on D10 (day of weaning). We suggest that the observed suppression of n-6 PUFAs metabolism and accumulation of LA in the blood at weaning and 14 days post-weaning did not depend on the source of fatty acids (milk or flaxseed) and related to the increase in IGF-I levels in the blood resulting in higher body weight. Moreover, \u0394-6-desaturase, the enzyme common for the catalysis of both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs (Stoffel et al., 2008) was decreased as well. The low activity of \u0394-6-desaturase in control sucklings could be due to its weak synthesis or activity as it was found in new-borns and children less than 6 month of age (Grofov\u00e1, 2010), but may be affected positively by the dietary flaxseed when high intake of n-3 ALA competes for this enzyme with n-6 LA in favor of n-3 PUFAs metabolism thus resulting in higher levels of DHA in the blood (Stoffel et al., 2008; Perini et al., 2011). The gas chromatography also revealed an increase in the levels of some SFAs, mostly myristic and palmitic acids and MUFA (palmitoleic acid) on D10 (day of weaning), although these were decreased on D24 (14 days after weaning). The low levels of DHA together with the high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids could promote proliferation and suppress of the apoptotis of follicular cells. However, the opposite changes in levels of those FAs had the reverse effects, which subsequently blocked the cell cycle and activated the bax-caspase 3 pathway of cell apoptosis (Butt et al., 1999). This is the first report of the level of those SFAs, MUFA and HUFA in the blood, which could affect the proliferation, and apoptosis of follicular cells in primordial, primary and secondary follicles on the ovaries of prepubertal gilts. The possible actions of the flax seed on the folliculogenesis are shown in Fig. 3\n. The possible mechanisms of action of selected fatty acids on the cell cycle and apoptosis and functional interrelationships between those fatty acids and phytoestrogens from flaxseed require further studies. It is possible that the action of the flaxseed on reproduction depends on the age of the females and the natural steroid production as observed in vitro on porcine ovaries of prepubertal 100-day old gilts (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) or in menopausal women (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013), the length of flaxseed supplementation and other dietary conditions (e.g. mother\u00b4s milk), but not on IGF-I plasma level.",

            "text": "Taken together, the study observations show the effect of fatty acids on porcine ovarian functions during a supplemental flaxseed period; nevertheless their direct effect and mechanism should be elucidated. It was demonstrated that the flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet (long-term supplementation period) with high intake of ALA from the flaxseed lowered the n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio and promoted the \u0394-6-desaturase activity for the metabolic pathway of n-3 PUFAs rather than for n-6 PUFAs, thus increasing the serum levels of DHA which together with low levels of selected SFA (myristic and palmitic acids) and MUFA (palmitoleic acid) activated apoptosis and suppressed the proliferation of all ovarian follicles. The inhibition of the elongation of LA to eicosadiaenoic acid decreased the cyclin B1 intensity in follicles, thus blocking the follicular cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle regardless of the type of PUFAs intake (n-6 or n-3). All these effects resulted in the suppression of follicular development on the ovaries of problematic weanling gilts. Flaxseed supplemented milk diet (short-term flaxseed feeding period) had the reverse effects, except for cyclin B1. Moreover, the accumulation of LA have probably positive correlation to the IGF-I synthesis in the liver and related with the growth phase of piglets thus resulting in higher body weight. The potential anti-gonadal action must be taken into account when consuming the flaxseed for longer periods.",
