Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation.

Because 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily has been reported to demonstrate efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the target R LTEC for hydroxychloroquine regimens was set to \u22652.38 (day 1), 5.92 (day 3), and 18.9 (day 5), which were the R LTEC values predicted with the \"efficacious\" 500 mg by mouth twicedaily dosing of chloroquine [16] . Various dosing regimens were simulated, but 2 are particularly notable. The first was an oral loading dose of 1200 mg (divided 800 mg then 400 mg) on day 1, followed by 400 mg daily. This regimen led to significantly higher R LTEC on day 1 (33.3), day 3 (55.1), and day 5 (103) than those values demonstrated with chloroquine. The second regimen was a loading dose of 800 mg (400 mg \u00d7 2) on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily.

Although this enhanced potency may very well prove true as more data become available, this report is counter to the relative potency demonstrated with the structurally similar SARS-CoV-1 strain in 2006 in which chloroquine was approximately 5 times more potent than hydroxychloroquine.

The investigators demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine (14 of 20, 70%) was superior to standard of care (2 of 16, 12.5%; P = .001) in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. It is interesting to note that 6 patients were prescribed azithromycin \"to prevent bacterial super-infection\" and the investigators found that viral eradication was numerically superior in this subgroup (6 of 6, 100%) compared with those who received hydroxychloroquine alone (8 of 14, 57%). The authors concluded that azithromycin \"reinforced\" the SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved by hydroxychloroquine. Although these data are intriguing, certain limitations to this data set must be acknowledged. First, although viral eradication is an important endpoint, the authors did not report clinical outcomes in these patients. Second, the cohort initially contained 26 hydroxychloroquine patients, but 6 of them were removed from the analysis due to early cessation of hydroxychloroquine therapy including 3 PCR-positive patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), 1 PCR-negative patient who passed away, and 1 PCR-positive patient who discontinued hydroxychloroquine due to nausea. Finally, the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy arm included patients with significantly higher viral loads, represented by lower cycle threshold (C T ) values than those who received combination therapy.
