Theatres, banquets, lectures, restaurants and movies were closed. Newark, New Jersey officials allowed liquor stores to stay open for sales only -a move protested by local church leaders. Newark hospitals are described as \"overwhelmed with civilians and soldiers from nearby military bases\" [19, p 150] . In San Diego, California all public facilities were closed. Many cities required face masks -fashioned with layers of square gauze tied at the top of the head and the back of the neck -to be worn in public; Compliance varied. Social systems were disrupted including telephone service, public transportation (train and taxi operators became ill), and nurses, firefighters, teachers, and priests were sick and absent from work. Lillian Wald, founder of public health nursing in New York wrote to a friend explaining that 40,000 nurses were needed to provide necessary services to the city's poor [19, p 150] .",

Her hospital (with capacity of 250-beds) admitted 850 patients with flu or flu-like pneumonia during six weeks.\" She notes a shortage of nurses during this time -with more than 50 nurses in military service overseas. Deming specifically observed the emotional impact of this work: \"*My classmate and I+ were fairly well prepared for this ordeal: prepared, that is, for all but the emotional impact of the situation\u2026. Until the epidemic, death had seemed kindly, coming to the very old, the incurably suffering, or striking suddenly with the knowledge of its victim. Now we saw death clutch cruelly and ruthlessly at vigorous, well-muscled young women in the prime of life\" [20, p 1309].",

This 3-step monitoring process is referred to as \"contact tracing\" (WHO [29] ): 1) Contact identification -after a person has a confirmed infection, identification of contacts involves interviews to identify the person's activities, and roles of people around them since the onset of illness. Contacts include anyone who has been in contact with the infected person -family members, work colleagues, friends, and health care providers. 2) Contact listing -Any persons known to have contact with the infected person are listed as \"contacts\", and efforts are made to identify each contact, inform them of their at risk status, actions to follow, information about accessing early care, and disease prevention and mitigation strategiesquarantine or isolation is required for high risk contacts. 3) Contact follow-up -is a painstaking, resource intensive, and expensive process, though technologic advances can diminish the intensity of such tasks. Regular follow-up of close contacts generally consists of daily telephone calls, text messaging, and/or in-person inquiries about fever and other symptoms for 14 days after the last known exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19. If and when close contacts develop new or worsening symptoms, they are referred for diagnostic testing and appropriate treatment.",

The challenge to deliver oncology services is further compounded by COVID-19 infection spread to nursing and medical personnel, school closures, all of which impact staffing levels. Moreover, to create new local COVID-19 services means that there is an on-going re-shuffling and re-allocating of resource (human and budget) which puts additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity. Figures from China's National Health Commission demonstrated that more than 3300 healthcare workers were infected, and 22 had died related to COVID-19 [40] . As the pandemic accelerates providing PPE to deliver safe oncology services is a key concern worldwide [12] . If acute care services are at maximum capacity, institutions may provide alternative provisions for the care of people affected by cancer. Therefore, oncology nurses will need to be flexible to facilitate the safe delivery of alternative models of care.

First, that of intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for people with low risk cancers. Second, should surgery suites and personnel be seconded elsewhere or are unavailable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered for timely delivery of oncologic manoeuvres for some malignancies. Hypofractionated radiotherapy protocols should be prescribed whenever possible [41] , including single fraction treatments for uncomplicated bone metastases [42] . Third, protective approaches such as PPE and personal space modifications should be considered, see Table 3 . During chemotherapy administration, treatment beds or chairs should be placed with adequate space (1.5 meters) to prevent close contact as much as possible. Limiting or eliminating family attendance, while stressful, may be necessary in limited chemotherapy suite spaces. In such cases, portable technology such as smart phones or iPads could be loaned during the treatment session for patient and family support and subsequently disinfected between patient usage. Finally, more intensive surveillance during and in the recovery period should be considered when patients with cancer are infected with COVID-19, especially older patients and those with multiple co-morbidities [12] .",

To date, there is limited evidence on the role of palliative care on managing the COVID-19 pandemic when it should be one of the key components in the strategies. The limited capacity of services to deal with the volume of affected people and families and protective isolation measures that aim to contain transmission can both result in limited or no visiting from family members impacting preparatory grief processes and the notion of having a good death. Charitable organisations currently offer a range of support services to the public affected by COVID-19 [70, 71] .",
