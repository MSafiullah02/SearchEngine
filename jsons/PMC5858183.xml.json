VLPs are potent immunogens, able to stimulate B cell/antibody responses, CD4+ T\u2010cell responses, and cytotoxic T\u2010cell responses.17, 18 Owing to their lack of a viral genome, VLP\u2010based vaccines circumvent some risks associated attenuated or inactivated live viruses, highlighting an advantage of supramolecular systems: they are more compositionally defined than the analogous biological structures, viruses. They also have advantages over subunit vaccines based on viral proteins or peptides conjugated to carrier proteins, which commonly require higher and more frequent dosing and adjuvants to be as effective as inactivated or attenuated viruses.19 As alternatives to these previous platforms, VLPs were developed to display an array of epitopes that mimic the surface of native viruses more effectively than subunit or peptide vaccines, thus improving their immunogenic properties.20 VLPs, like viruses, come in a range structures including those with a single capsid protein, multiple capsid proteins, or those without lipid envelopes.21 VLPs consisting of multiple capsid proteins are expressed and assembled via subsequent processing or by co\u2010expression of polycistronic genes within a cell.",

Whereas the first translated VLP\u2010based vaccines raised antibodies against the naturally occurring virus capsid proteins of the assembled structure, VLPs can also be used as vehicles to display heterologous antigens associated with other infectious diseases. This modularity of the platform is described below, in the discussion of chimeric and decorated VLPs. The manufacturability of VLPs depends upon the complexity of the platform. For example, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK's) Cervarix (human papillomavirus, HPV), Engerix (hepatitis B virus), Merck & Co.'s Recombivax HB (hepatitis B virus), and Gardasil (human papillomavirus) are generated based on a single capsid protein\u2014a feature that accelerated expression optimization and subsequent approval and commercialization. However, as platforms become increasingly complex, they become increasingly more challenging to manufacture at a large scale. Multi\u2010subunit, chimeric, and other types of VLPs must overcome these challenges.

At the time, a growing number of HPV genotypes were identified and associated with benign genital warts and or precursor lesions to cervical cancer.

One important advancement was the development of an in vitro method of producing HPV virions. The HPV lifecycle is linked to human epithelial tissue differentiation which is difficult to achieve in vitro. Kreider et al. overcame this challenge was overcome by developing a complex xenograft model in which human foreskin epithelial tissue was infected with HPV 11 and grown under the renal capsule of athymic mice. This method allowed for the production of infectious HPV 11.23 In 1995, animal challenge studies were published that continued to advance HPV vaccines. Two studies demonstrated measurable serum antibody responses to VLP immunization and subsequent protection in later challenges.23 The third demonstrated the importance of maintaining the native VLP structure for optimal vaccine efficacy.24 Another key contribution to the success of MRL's HPV vaccine came from work developing a manufacturing process for HBsAg production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

            "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, one of the key strategic strengths of supramolecular systems is the modularity that they tend to possess. In VLPs, this modularity is exemplified by chimeric VLPs, in which epitopes of choice from various diseases are inserted into the particle\u2010forming proteins. Provided that the new epitope can be inserted in a way that does not disrupt self\u2010assembly, and that presents the epitope on the surface of the particle so that it is both antigenic and immunogenic, the modularity of the system is maintained.20 By being able to insert epitopes of choice, the range of therapeutic applications becomes quite broad. For example, several clinical studies are currently evaluating chimeric VLP vaccines for the treatment of noninfectious diseases such as cancer (melanoma),30 neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease),31 autoimmune diseases (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthmas),32 and other disorders. Another approach for including chosen epitopes/antigens is separately expressing the VLP and target protein and conjugating them together. This approach is often preferable and necessary due to differences in optimal expression conditions for each component. Thus, postproduction methods have been developed to link the VLP and target antigen. This is achieved through genetic manipulation, coupling via supramolecular or covalent bonds, or by encapsulation of cargo by disassembling and reassembling purified VLPs in the presence of the desired molecule.33 Coupling chemistries range from the use of bifunctional crosslinkers, click chemistry, sortase\u2010mediated attachment, polyhistidine/NTA\u2010Ni2+, or affinity\u2010tag interactions to conjugate the VLP and target antigen34 Notably, these postproduction\u2010modified VLPs have led to several platforms currently being tested in clinical trials.35, 36, 37\n",

The group reported that SpyCatcher\u2010VLPs decorated with the CIDR or Pfs25 antigens generated a robust antibody response are only a single immunization without requiring adjuvant. This platform shows promise in application such as drug delivery, enzyme scaffolds, biosensors, and cancer immunotherapy,41 and it mitigates the need for complex chimeric protein expression or the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, as would be necessary in copper\u2010catalyzed azide\u2010alkyne cycloaddition (click chemistry) or other chemoselective bioconjugation reactions.",

To address this challenge, the Chackerian group has developed a VLP\u2010based vaccine candidate that is compatible with spray drying, thus enhancing its stability over a broad range of temperatures.43 This platform targets a highly conserved, broadly neutralizing epitope from the HPV minor capsid protein, L2. Not only does this vaccine elicit high\u2010titer and long\u2010lasting antibody immune responses,44 but the spray dried VLPs were highly immunogenic in a mouse model after being stored for 14 months at either room temperature or 37 \u00b0C. Other constraints that VLPs are subject to include the relatively small size of epitopes that can be accommodated within the particles. For example, large antigens such as HIV envelope and influenza hemagglutinin proteins are too large to be packaged within native VLPs. The practicality of VLP platforms is also limited by manufacturing considerations.21 For example, VLPs derived from E. coli, the most widely used and most efficient expression system in the biotechnology industry, have a high degree of heterogeneity in their physical properties, including the shape and diameter of the particles. Such particles require post\u2010purification disassembly and reassembly in optimized conditions. In addition, it may be possible to produce highly immunogenic VLP preparations, but the antigen might not be viable in the VLP context until stable formulations can be developed. Formulations must be resistant to aggregation upon exposure to low salt and protein concentration, as well as protection against surface adsorption and aggregation as a result of heat stress and physical agitation in order to achieve the multiple\u2010year stability required for a marketed vaccine.20 Newer expression systems in conjunction with innovative purification strategies could determine the pace for the next generation of VLP\u2010based vaccine candidates. For example, yeast, insect, and mammalian expression systems have been used to circumvent the limitations of bacterial expression such as sub\u2010optimal pH and lipid compositions within the bacteria. Additionally, the advancement of high\u2010throughput biophysical and structural analyses of recombinant VLPs may play a key role in the assessment of VLP candidates. Electron microscopy, electrospray differential mobility analysis, atomic force microscopy, X\u2010ray crystallography, and dynamic light scattering provide quantitative structural data for each vaccine candidate and play a valuable role in ensuring product robustness from the early clinical development stage and beyond.20\n",

This pH\u2010sensitive assembly was specifically explored in the context of enamel remineralization in 2007, where simulated intraoral conditions were employed to assess the performance of self\u2010assembled scaffolds which were administered in a basic solution, allowed to fibriliize, and then incubated under cyclic pH.78 These studies were completed on enamel lesions formed on extracted human teeth and indicated that the P11 scaffold caused hydroxyapatite mineralization where the peptide solution was applied.78 Thus, positive and significant results were obtained without the need for specialized application methods or a poorly translatable animal model, a significant advantage for the development of polypeptide biomaterials toward dental applications. After the enamel restorative properties of P11 were developed in preclinical models, Credentis was founded in 2010, Curodont was launched as the company's first product, and its safety and efficacy were verified in a clinical trial to treat dental caries.78 In 2012 it received market approval (CE\u2010label) for medical devices in the EU.

The advancement of these platforms can be attributed to many factors. Peptides and proteins are more economical than ever to produce, and manufacturing efficiencies continue to be developed. The design rules for each subclass of materials has been significantly mapped in recent years. And strategies have been optimized for incorporating disease\u2010specific ligands, epitopes, or other moieties within each platform. We expect the coming decades to witness the implementation of many new examples of supramolecular polypeptide therapies.",

It remains to be seen whether such responses can be tolerated in specific applications, or if they could even be turned in the favor of the material's clinical performance. Interestingly, neither Curodont78 nor Purastat67 contain specific ligands/epitopes, possibly avoiding immunogenicity that may be observed in trials of other nanofibrous materials containing additional protein or peptide functional components.",
