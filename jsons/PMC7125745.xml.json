            "text": "The putative functions of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) N protein depend on its interaction with viral RNA (Baric et al., 1988). Encapsidation of MHV RNA requires that the N protein recognize the packaging signal, a 69-nt stem-loop structure positioned at the end of ORF 1b, whereas the packaging signal in the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus apparently lies in the ORF 1a (Van der Most et al., 1991, Fosmire et al., 1992, Izeta et al., 1999). Interactions between the MHV N protein and the packaging signal have been reported (Molenkamp and Spaan, 1997). A 1.4-kb sequence, corresponding to IBV sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the 1b gene, may be involved in the packaging of IBV RNAs or form part of a cis-acting replication element (Penzes et al., 1996). However, subgenomic RNAs, lacking the described packaging signals, have been detected in the packaged IBV particles (Zhao et al., 1993). MHV N protein has also been shown to interact specifically with the 5\u2032 leader-containing sequences (Baric et al., 1988, Stohlman et al., 1988). Anti-N protein monoclonal antibodies were reported to precipitate both full-length and subgenomic RNAs, as well as replicative intermediate RNA (Stohlman et al., 1988). Compton et al. (1987) found that RNA synthesis was greater than 90% inhibited by antibodies to MHV N protein in an in vitro synthesis system prepared from the infected cells. All these data suggest that the coronavirus N protein is likely to be involved in viral RNA replication, transcription and packaging.",

A 55-nt sequence in the 3\u2032 terminus of genomic RNA and the poly (A) tail of the MHV RNA were found to be required for minus-strand RNA synthesis (Lin et al., 1994). In addition, Lin et al. (1996) also found that the 3\u2032 non-coding region of MHV RNA is required for the positive-sense subgenomic RNA transcription from a DI RNA. Hsue and Masters (1997) identified a stem-loop structure in the MHV 3\u2032 untranslated region which is essential for RNA replication. It is evident that the 3\u2032 end untranslated region plays very important roles in viral RNA replication and transcription.",

In this study, the intact IBV N protein and six overlapping polypeptides were expressed in a bacterial expression system and their interactions with the 3\u2032 end of genomic RNA were examined using gel shift assays (Zhou et al., 1996).

Possible motifs were searched against the database using the MOTIF program. The whole N gene and six overlapping cDNA sequences were amplified from the G2 plasmid by PCR. A BamHI site was included at the 5\u2032 end and a HindIII site at the 3\u2032 end. The PCR amplified cDNAs were cloned into TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmids containing the inserts were digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the inserts were purified in 1% agarose gels and then ligated into pQE8 vectors, which were also fully digested with BamHI and HindIII (Sambrook et al., 1989). The fusion protein and polypeptides expressed from pQE8 plasmid contained six histidine tags at the amino termini. M15/pREP cells were transformed with the ligated constructs and incubated on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin and ampicillin. Single colonies were screened with mini-preparation and HindIII digestion. cDNAs from positive colonies with inserts were sequenced to confirm the orientation and fidelity with ABI-PRISM (Model 377, Version 2.1.1, DNA Technology Facilities, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University).",

The gel shift assays were performed in the presence of 200-fold excess of non-specific RNA. Therefore, interactions with the G RNA and CD RNA indicate the strong binding affinities of the N polypeptides with viral RNAs. Moreover, none of the control proteins, BSA, CVV N protein and lysozyme, interacted with G and CD RNA. Confirming a preference for specific RNA, interactions of N with yeast tRNA and ribosomal RNA, minus-strand RNA from the 3\u2032 genomic end (data not shown), and fragment EF from the 3\u2032 genomic end are consistently negligible (Zhou et al., 1996). Interactions between the N and IBV RNA may be the consequence of multiple binding sites in the N, RNA or both. The shift of IBV RNA always increases with increasing amount of protein. Multiple bands can even be observed with some interactions. Furthermore, the carboxyl polypeptides, C140 and C207, shifted the RNA probe further than amino region polypeptides. Protein-protein interactions may also contribute to the increased complexity of interactions with RNA. This phenomenon may be explained by the presence of multiple binding sites in the RNA and/or protein. The carboxyl region polypeptides, even the smaller C140 fragment, were found to form large complexes in the absence of RNA during filtration purification through Bio-Gel P60 (data not shown). Formation of N multimers was also observed by Robbins et al. (1986) where multiple bands were detected by labeled RNA with RNA protein blot analysis.",

Studies on MHV also indicated that both N protein and sequences in the 3\u2032 non-coding region are involved in regulating the viral RNA replication and transcription (Compton et al., 1987, Lin et al., 1996). The putative roles that the IBV N protein plays in replication and transcription could be speculated. Critical amounts of N protein may act as an inhibitor competing with transcriptional factors for the binding sites. Alternatively, the N protein could promote transcriptional factors to the sites. The 3\u2032 non-coding region of MHV has been shown to interact with cellular proteins (Yu and Leibowitz, 1995); the actual involvement of those proteins in viral RNA transcription is not clear.",
