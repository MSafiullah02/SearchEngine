            "text": "The causes of anaemia may be identified systematically by considering the life cycle of the red cells (Figure 65.1\n). Nutrients necessary for red cell production are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and carried through the portal vein to the liver and ultimately reach the bone marrow where erythropoiesis occurs. This process is regulated by erythropoietin, a hormone released from the kidneys mainly in response to hypoxia. Mature red cells are released into the circulation from the bone marrow and percolate through the tissues and organs. Anaemia can result from defects in any of these stages. Inadequate production of red cells in the bone marrow can be due to lack of nutrients (e.g. iron, B12, folate, vitamin A, copper or zinc), abnormal haemoglobin synthesis (i.e. haemoglobinopathies) or ineffective erythropoeisis from myelodysplasia or infections. Red cells can be lost from the body (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding) or removed prematurely if they are abnormal or the spleen is enlarged (i.e. haemolysis). Kidney disease can result in decreased erythropoietin. Anaemia of chronic disease (or \u2018anaemia of inflammation\u2019) is due to an inadequate response to erythropoieitin or to increased cytokine-induced hepcidin release in inflammatory states which interferes with iron absorption or iron utilization.",

Cells in the marginal pool are not sampled when blood is taken for a full blood count.1 Neutrophilia can therefore result from increased bone marrow synthesis and also from decreased margination which increases the circulating pool. There are many causes of neutrophilia (Box 65.1\n) but the commonest is bacterial infection in which there is increased bone marrow production of neutrophils and release of neutrophil precursors into the peripheral blood. This \u2018leukaemoid reaction\u2019, characterized by circulating myelocytes and metamyelocytes, can be mistaken for leukaemia but, unlike leukaemia, there is an orderly maturation and proliferation of neutrophils. Leukaemoid reactions have also been described in patients with tuberculosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and dermatitis herpetiformis.2, 3 Decreased margination of neutrophils with egress of cells into the circulation can occur with exercise, adrenaline (epinephrine) injection, emotional stress and postoperatively or in response to drugs (e.g. steroids, \u03b2-agonists).

Molecular testing for the JAK-2 mutation or BCR-ABL fusion gene can also help to differentiate between myeloproliferative neoplasms. Rebound neutrophilia can occur following treatment of megaloblastic anaemia or after recovery from neutropenia induced by drugs. Acute haemorrhage can cause neutrophilia, especially if bleeding occurs into the peritoneal cavity, pleural space, joints or adjacent to the dura.

In addition, infant and toddler diets often lack bio-available iron.

Heavy tea intake can interfere with iron absorption and should be avoided. Multivitamin or dietary supplements containing calcium, zinc or copper can also interfere with iron absorption.

Blood tests may demonstrate increased lactate dehydrogenase and low haptoglobin levels due to haemolysis within the bone marrow. The cause of the macrocytosis can be confirmed by bone marrow examination which reveals a megaloblastic picture. Although macrocytic anaemia is a typical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency, it can be absent in older individuals who may only have neuropsychiatric features. Measurements of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, two markers which are very sensitive for detecting B12 deficiency, have shown that vitamin B12 deficiency can occur with normal haemoglobin levels and without macrocytosis.36\n",

Other causes include alcoholism, excessive cooking of vegetables, and malabsorption (e.g. abnormalities of the small bowel). Increased demand for folic acid occurs in pregnancy because the growing foetus has a high avidity for folate. For this reason, folate supplementation has been widely recognized as an essential part of routine antenatal care to reduce the risks of neural tube defects. High folate utilization also occurs in haemolytic anaemias such as sickle cell disease due to high red cell turnover and exfoliative dermatitis.

This phenomenon occurs where there is deoxygenation and is due to the binding between \u03b21 and \u03b22 chains of two haemoglobin molecules, a property unique to haemoglobin variants that have the Glu-6-Val substitution.74 The polymerized haemoglobin fills the erythrocyte and deforms its architecture and flexibility to form a sickle shape. This alteration in the structure promotes cellular dehydration,70, 75, 76 Upon reoxygenation, the polymers dissolve thus reversing the sickling process. However repeated sickling and unsickling eventually causes irreversible changes,77 so early management to avoid repeated crises is important to prevent disease progression.",

These crises are the result of vaso-occlusion of the bone marrow causing bone infarction and release of mediators that activate pain receptors.82 The number, severity and frequency of painful episodes vary widely in individuals. Half may never have any episodes whereas about 3% may need hospital admission up to 6 times a year.89 More than three pain episodes requiring hospitalization per year is associated with increased mortality among patients over 20 years old. In under-resourced settings, hospital visits underestimate the frequency of pain since many do not seek medical help.90 Exposure to cold, fever, menstruation, alcohol intake and dehydration can precipitate pain crises. Unlike acute pain crises, chronic pain in SCD usually has an identifiable basis such as femoral head necrosis, osteoarthritis or chronic skin ulcers.",

Both thrombotic and haemorrhagic strokes occur, although the former is more common in children and those over 30 years of age, whereas the latter is more common between the ages of 20 and 30 years.108 This age-specific pattern may be related to the higher cerebral flow rates in early childhood. Although the prevalence of clinically overt stroke is of the order of 11%, clinically silent infarction, detectable by magnetic resonance scans, affect nearly double this number by the age of 20. Silent infarcts are associated with cognitive impairment and the majority of these children require lifelong specialist care.104 Cerebral thrombosis, which accounts for 70\u201380% of all strokes in SCD, results from large-vessel occlusion whereas silent infarcts are the result of microvascular occlusion or thrombosis or hypoxia secondary to large-vessel disease. In a third of SCD patients, major-vessel stenosis is accompanied by collateral vessels that appear as \u2018puffs of smoke\u2019 (moyamoya) on angiography. Risk factors for ischaemic strokes in SCD include increased cerebral blood flow velocity, previous silent infarcts, nocturnal hypoxaemia, severe anaemia, acute chest syndrome and elevated systolic blood pressure. An elevated leukocyte count is a risk factor for haemorrhagic stroke.105, 106, 107, 108\n",

It is usually hypogonadotrophic suggesting iron damage to the anterior pituitary or hypothalamus. The features range from total absence of sexual development to delayed puberty. In females with normal menstrual function, fertility is normal with the ovarian function preserved in most although secondary amenorrhoea can develop. Damage of the ovaries is rare and is more likely to appear in older women (around 30) because of high vascular activity on the ovaries at this age. Secondary hypogonadism is common (50%) in older men. Serum ferritin >2000 ng/mL is a risk factor.\u2022Hypothyroidism is the second most common endocrine disorder (about 20%) although many of them may have the subclinical variety. Most commonly hypothyroidism is of the primary type with secondary, central hypothyroidism increasingly being diagnosed in recent years.\u2022The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is around 5% with the mean age of diagnosis being 18 years. Impaired glucose tolerance occurs first with microvascular damage like retinal changes being less common than the conventional form. Chronic hepatitis C infection can precipitate the onset of diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance usually responds to oral hypoglycaemics although insulin therapy can be difficult due to difficult glycaemic control.\n",

The haemoglobin profile varies across the spectrum of \u03b2-thalassaemia syndromes. HbF levels are increased, varying from around 10% in the more mild forms, to 100% in homozygous patients who are unable to make any HbA (\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2). Levels of HbA2 can vary from normal to 7%. Reticulocytosis occurs but is 2\u20138% lower than would be expected for the extreme erythroid hyperplasia reflecting intramedullary erythroid precursor destruction. Osmotic fragility is reduced, sometimes strikingly so since in some cases the red blood cells do not haemolyse even in distilled water.161 For this reason, if sophisticated tests are not available, osmotic fragility can be used as a screening test for thalassaemia trait. Serum zinc levels may be low and this may be related to abnormal growth.162 Vitamin C levels may also be low due to its increased conversion to oxalic acid in the presence of iron overload.163 Care may be needed if folic acid is commenced on a background of bone marrow failure due to folate deficiency as it may precipitate painful erythropoietic crises.164\nBox 65.15A Stepwise Approach to Diagnosis of Thalassaemias\n\nFAMILY HISTORY OF HAEMOLYTIC DISEASE OR THALASSAEMIA\n\u2022Ethnic background can be helpful in considering the type of thalassaemia\u2022Age of onset can aid in determining the severity and need for blood transfusions\u2022Development of the child can be useful to know the likely complications\u2022Late-onset complications including heart, liver and endocrine effects is also helpful.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\n\u2022Anaemia\u2022Haemolysis\u2022Bone changes\u2022Splenomegaly\u2022Endocrine assessment.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\u2022Blood count \u2013 severe anaemia with thalassaemia major; in thalassaemia minor or trait; the mean cell volume is decreased disproportionately to the haemoglobin while the mean haemoglobin concentration is markedly reduced (20\u201322 pg)\u2022Blood film \u2013 Microcytic, hypochromic red cells; Target cells, polychromasia; Basophilic stippling; Nucleated red cells (very high levels after splenectomy); Poikilocytes in non-splenectomized patients\u2022Haemoglobin electrophoresis at alkaline and acidic pH \u2013 haemoglobin on a membrane is subjected to charge gradient which separates them and can be identified by special stains for haem or protein\u2022High-performance liquid chromatography \u2013 this procedure which separates components by their adsorption onto a negatively charged stationary phase on a chromatography column followed by elution to detect and quantify haemoglobins A, A2 and F and variants\u2022Isoelectric focussing \u2013 the haemoglobins are separated in a polyacrylamide or cellulose acetate gel containing molecules with different isoelectric values (when they do not have a net charge) and are identified based on comparisons with the known variants after staining.\n",

Thalassaemia patients can develop thromboembolic complications and pulmonary hypertension after splenectomy so partial splenectomy and splenic embolization have been attempted to minimize these complications but have not been studied in large trials.",

Iron overload needs to be detected early and treated to prevent long-term damage. Annual assessment of the iron loading of the liver and heart can be achieved using non-invasive methods such as magnetic resonance scanning to detect early changes. Children should have regular growth and endocrine assessments and appropriate investigations should be carried out if there are any signs of developmental delay or hormonal deficiencies. Osteoporosis is increasingly being recognized and should be prevented by ensuring adequate dietary calcium intake and sun exposure.

The mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) is used to screen for the presence of thalassaemia using a cut-off of less than 27 pg. Rarely, silent \u03b2-thalassaemia mutation may present with an MCV over 27 pg and should be considered in those with a positive family history. At-risk couples should be referred for detailed counselling on the options for prenatal diagnosis. These include chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis, which are used to obtain fetal DNA samples for genetic analysis. Polymerase chain reactions and precise hybridization assays to detect single point mutations using very small DNA samples have also been developed. A less invasive and less risky option is to isolate fetal DNA circulating in the maternal blood for genetic analysis. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is a newer technique where DNA from the blastomere is used for genetic diagnosis. Ultrasound can be used from the 2nd trimester for fetuses suspected of having \u03b1-thalassaemia to detect signs of hydrops fetalis and enlarged placenta (Figure 65.9\n).175, 176\n",

G6PD is an enzyme that catalyses the first reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway, to produce NADPH, which is an important antioxidant used to preserve the reduced form of glutathione.178, 181 Reduced glutathione acts as a scavenger for oxidative metabolites thereby protecting red cells. Red cells lack any other source of NADPH and are solely dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway so G6PD deficiency leaves these cells with no defence against oxidative damage. Oxidative damage results in denatured haemoglobin aggregates which form Heinz bodies (denatured haemoglobin precipitates). These damaged cells bind to the membrane cytoskeleton resulting in decreased cellular deformability, and are also destroyed in the spleen, resulting in haemolysis. The level of enzyme activity is higher in young erythrocytes than in more mature cells so older cells are more susceptible to haemolysis.",

Definitive diagnosis of G6PD deficiency is by quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of the rate of NADPH production. Point of care tests for G6PD deficiency are being developed but have not yet been validated for routine use. Measuring enzyme activity during an episode of acute haemolysis is not helpful since reticulocytosis, which is a feature of acute haemolysis, produces a false-negative result because of the high enzyme levels in younger erythrocytes.179, 186\n",

Although the process of haemostasis is usually considered to occur in a stepwise fashion, in vivo the steps happen virtually simultaneously. Activation of the lining of the endothelium by trauma, cancer cells or cytokines triggers vasoconstriction, which immediately limits the amount of blood loss. Exposure of the subendothelial space releases factors such as von Willebrand factor multimers which bind to platelets and initiate platelet adhesion to the endothelium. The adherent platelets release their granules and attract more platelets, which in combination with fibrinogen, form an aggregate. The activated platelets also attract coagulation factors thereby promoting the clotting process. The critical parts of clot formation are the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and the thrombin-facilitated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (Figure 65.13\n). Haemostatic control mechanisms operate throughout the clotting process to prevent excessive clot formation and involve proteins C and S, and anti-thrombin and antifibrinolytic systems.

Some inherited platelet function disorders are associated with characteristic syndromes (e.g. oculocutaneous albinism or skeletal defects) which may provide a clue to the diagnosis.",
