A set of scientific goals includes defining the best molecule or biologic construct for the task at hand, and proving the case for its development. The second set of goals addresses regulatory requirements necessary to introduce the agent into human subjects. In the case of \"small molecule\" drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward. In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges. The nature of the \"drug\" may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination. Its properties may vary depending on the scale and method of its preparation, purification, and storage. How to test adequately for its safety prior to first introduction in humans may not be straightforward owing to intrinsic differences in response to the agent expected in humans as compared to animals.",

The ethical conduct of clinical trials in patients with a dire or lifethreatening disease demands an understanding of the identity and dose of an agent that has the possibility of causing clinical benefit with adverse events expected at worst to be easily reversible and well predicted by the preclinical experience. In normal volunteers or patients who are otherwise well, evidence should be gathered that would support an initial range of doses of the test agent expected to be without substantial toxicity or long-term effects.",

This integration should begin in the research laboratory, as the concept becomes a candidate for the clinic, to prevent avoidable and expensive delays in clinical development. For example, if a product is created using a mammalian cell line for which viral or other contamination has not been ruled out, costly rederivation will be required before that product can be manufactured for clinical trials using current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). On the other hand, during the discovery phase, an excessive and premature concern over cGMP compliance can impede research. Therefore, a clear strategic understanding of the principles underlying regulatory issues is desirable and is the goal of this chapter.",

Reorganization at the FDA is currently under way that will result in regulation of many biotherapeutics by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which has oversight of small molecule drugs. It is anticipated, however, that blood products, vaccines, and gene therapy products will remain with CBER. The Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee is a chartered advisory group with the role of advising the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of biological products, including gene therapy. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) also oversees gene therapy research through the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities. The RAC was established in 1974 in response to public concerns regarding the safety of recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology. Human gene transfer trials in which NIH funding is involved (either directly or indirectly) are to be submitted to the RAC for review.

The ICH Steering Committee meets at least twice a year to continue their agenda of updating and harmonizing regulations for medicinal products; they emphasize safety, quality, and efficacy. Expert Working Groups were formed within ICH to address specific topics related to these basic areas. Although the FDA has not formally adopted all of the ICH guidelines, these guidelines should be followed when they exist in preliminary form. For investigators planning to conduct investigational drug trials in foreign countries, it is imperative that they be familiar with, and adhere to, the regulations set forth by ICH.",

This philosophy reflects the conscious effort not to stifle innovation in early phase clinical testing, but to ensure that, by the time registrationoriented late-stage trials are contemplated, issues related to production variability, assay, and assurance of safety are mature and well-substantiated because the results of such trials could be the basis for sale of the agent to the public. Another factor that affects the level of regulatory compliance is the nature of the study population. Products manufactured for Phase I trials in healthy normal volunteers typically must meet much stricter requirements than those studied in patients with dire, life-threatening conditions (e.g., cancer or end-stage acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).

The same may happen in animals if a purified protein is administered via a gene therapy viral vector. In the case of human factor IX, when the purified protein was administered to rhesus macaques, the monkeys did not make antibodies (67) . However, when factor IX was administered in a first-generation adenoviral vector, the animals mounted an acute phase response that produced neutralizing antibody that eliminated factor IX from the circulation (68) . Finally, the occurrence of severe anaphylactic responses to recombinant proteins is rare in humans. The results of guinea pig anaphylaxis tests, which are generally positive for protein products, are not considered predictive for reactions in humans; therefore, studies such as this are considered of little value for the routine evaluation of these types of products even though they are frequently performed. Inflammatory, immune, or autoimmune responses induced by the gene product may be of concern. Animal studies should be conducted over a sufficient duration of time to allow development of such responses. Host immune responses against viral or transgene proteins may limit their usefulness for repeated administration in the clinic. The immune status of the intended recipients of a gene therapy should be considered in the risk-benefit analysis of a product, particularly for viral vectors.

The use of smaller animals (i.e., mice or rats) allows the inclusion of larger numbers of animals and the easy evaluation of more time points. As in other studies, the following dose groups should be included when practical: controls, the maximally feasible/clinically relevant dose, and a lower dose for establishment of the no observable adverse effect level. The route of administration should mimic intended clinical route to the greatest extent possible. Regarding animal sacrifice and/or sampling time points, an early point that reflects peak vector transduction/expression should be included, as should a later timepoint determined by intended clinical use and a time-point that should reflect clearance from the gonads and nontarget organs to determine persistence. The following tissues are generally recommended: peripheral blood; gonads; injection site; highly perfused organs (to assist in determination of toxicity) such as brain, liver, lung, kidneys, heart, spleen; other tissues based on toxicity/pathology as determined by transgene (e.g., bone marrow); and those based on the route of administration, such as draining, contralateral lymph nodes. The methodology used to detect the agent should detect a sequence of the vector DNA (or ribonucleic acid) that is unique to that product and should be appropriate to detect the vector sequence adequately in tissue samples from both preclinical animal studies and samples obtained during the initial clinical trials.

Animals that received the low-dose vector and GCV were clinically normal and exhibited small MRI abnormalities, and although no gross lesions were present at necropsy, microscopic foci of necrosis were present. Neutralizing antibodies were produced in the animals, but no shedding of the vector was found in urine, feces, or serum 7 days after intracerebral injection (74) .",

Antibodies against tissue-specific cell surface proteins can also be coupled to the fiber protein to facilitate partial targeting of the virus (97) . Another approach to achieve \"targeting\" of the virus is the use of cell-specific promoters to drive expression of a therapeutic gene in the context of the recombinant virus (98) . Enhanced uptake strategies through fiber modification may present special concerns for toxicity, especially regarding hepatotoxicity when administered by an intravenous or direct hepatic artery injection.

Disadvantages include an infection that is limited to dividing cells, which makes gene transfer into nondividing cells such as hematopoietic stem cells, hepatocytes, myoblasts, and neurons an impossibility, and low titer of products.",

These are insertional mutagenesis, recombination with endogenous retroviral sequences, transfer of exogenous genetic material, and accidental exposure to replicationcompetent murine retroviruses (115) . Because retroviral vectors can permanently integrate into the genome of the infected cell, there is a serious concern regarding insertional mutagenesis causing the development of a secondary malignancy. The presence of RCRs is of major concern because of the fact that RCRs have produced lethal malignant T-cell lymphomas in 3/10 rhesus monkeys (78) . These concerns resulted in a publication concerning the FDA considerations on these issues (116) and the issuance of a new FDA guidance on this subject in October 2000 (36) . Some of these con-cerns are no longer theoretical. The elation that this type of retroviral-mediated therapy was successful in curing a number of children with SCID (117) has been severely dampened by the reports of a leukemialike disease produced in two of these children (10-13).",

This makes these viruses attractive for gene transfer. One of these viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has been the subject of investigation by a number of groups. The most obvious concerns with using HIV for gene therapy is safety and the possible generation of replication-competent virus during vector production. This involves engineering the vector so that it is replication defective. This has been done in a number of cases by eliminating all accessory genes, such as tat, vif, vpr, vpu, and nef, from a packaging construct that still has the ability to transduce cells (118) . Concern about the possibility of insertional activation of cellular oncogenes by a random integration of the vector provirus into the host genome has led to the development of self-inactivating vectors (119) (120) (121) (122) . The use of self-inactivating viruses significantly improves the biosafety of HIV-derived vectors because it reduces the likelihood that RCRs will originate during vector production and target cells and hampers recombination with wild-type HIV in an infected host. In an attempt to make even safer constructs, other groups are working on the development of lentiviral vectors from HIV-2 (123), simian immunodeficiency virus (124), bovine immunodeficiency virus (125, 126) , and feline immunodeficiency virus (127) . These last vectors may be inherently more acceptable because they are not based on HIV-1. None of these newer constructs has moved toward the clinic, so there is little animal safety data and no human data on these vectors yet.",

What dose is likely to be required for therapeutic effect? What level of gene expression or replication is necessary to attain a therapeutic effect? When toxicity occurs because of the agent, what is the evidence the toxicity will be reversible? Is toxicity after repeated doses of agent likely to be attenuated or magnified by immunological response to the agent? What are the consequences of long-term presence of the therapeutic agent in the recipient? Is there a danger of producing directly (as the therapeutic agent itself) or indirectly (through recombination and/or replication) an infectious agent that acts horizontally in the population or vertically across generations?

A clear understanding and a proactive approach in addressing regulatory issues outlined here will maximally ensure the likelihood of an interpretable clinical outcome. The regulatory issues outlined here must be approached with continuing appreciation of the evolving science associated with the gene therapy field.
