The clinical presentation of BRONJ is coupled with poor healing, spontaneous intraoral ulceration, and necrosis of the bone in the oral and maxillofacial regions (Sehbai et al, 2007). BRONJ has been described in a variety of malignant and non\u2010malignant diseases including skeletal metastasis from solid tumors, multiple myeloma, and osteoporosis. It has been suggested that the risk of developing BRONJ is related to the duration and/or dosing frequency of BP treatment (Ruggiero et al, 2004; Durie et al, 2005; Cremers and Farooki, 2011). Approximately 30% of patients with BRONJ are asymptomatic at clinical presentation, and the rest complain of severe local pain associated with soft\u2010tissue swelling, loosening of teeth, and drainage. Other symptoms may include numbness, heaviness, and dysesthesia of the affected jaw (Vassiliou et al, 2010).",

            "text": "The direct cause/effect relationship between BP treatment and BRONJ has yet to be elucidated although several possible mechanisms of BRONJ pathogenesis have been suggested including ischemia, reduced bone turnover, toxicity to bone, toxicity to soft tissue, microcracks, inflammation, and infection (Lesclous et al, 2009; Reid, 2009; Hoefert et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2010). ONJ incidence correlation with BP potency suggests that inhibition of osteoclast function and differentiation might be a key factor in the pathophysiology of the disease. However, ONJ associated with patients receiving denosumab, a human RANKL monoclonal antibody (Aghaloo et al, 2010), suggested another trigger for developing ONJ than BP therapy. The oral cavity is home to hundreds of microorganisms, and cases of bone necrosis secondary to BP therapy occur almost exclusively in the jaws where oral bacteria have access to bone (e.g., through saliva or odontogenic infection), especially after exposure of bone following a dental procedure such as an extraction. Compared with other parts of the body, bone can easily be colonized by the abundant flora of bacteria and yeast in the oral cavity that have the potential to cause biofilm\u2010mediated disease (2008, 2009). Hoefert and Eufinger (Hoefert and Eufinger, 2011) in their recent study indicated that long\u2010term preoperative antibiotic treatment can lead to a complete healing in 70\u201387% of cases in contrast to 35\u201353% with a short\u2010term regime. In addition, patients with cancer are routinely treated with immunosuppressive agents and these patients are susceptible to bacterial infections (Kosmidis and Chandrasekar, 2012). Affected bone is an ideal incubator for periodontal and periapical bacteria, chronically stimulating inflammatory and immune responses (Ricucci and Siqueira, 2008; Rokadiya and Malden, 2008; Heitz\u2010Mayfield and Lang, 2010). Although the disease can occur spontaneously, 90% of cases are coupled with surgical dental treatment, such as tooth extractions, mandibular exostoses, periodontal disease, and local trauma from ill\u2010fitting dentures.",

BP treatment may change the oral environment of the patient and BRONJ may be supported by increased bacterial adhesion to bone coated with BPs (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011). The bone exposition during the surgery or during tooth extraction acts as a trigger opening the door for bacterial invasion. As a result, it creates a more favorable condition for the growth of oral pathogens on the bone surface that may be a contributing factor to the development of BRONJ. To delineate the BRONJ pathogenesis, it is vital to identify the bacterial species/phylotypes that colonize jawbone associated with BRONJ. Moreover, it is not well understood whether the bacteria involved in bone infection associated with BRONJ is similar or different to other biofilm associated bone infections in the oral cavity (Ruggiero et al, 2004; 2008, 2009) (Ruggiero et al, 2009).",

The term \u2018control\u2019 is broadly used throughout the article to refer to subjects not treated with BPs and without BRONJ but have cancer and jawbone infection that require surgical procedures as part of their standard of care treatment. Patients who were pregnant or lactating; who had a history of radiation therapy to the head and neck region; with BRONJ who had responded to conservative therapy and did not require surgical intervention; with osteonecrosis of the jaw that was associated with other conditions (e.g., Paget\u2019s disease of bone, fibro\u2010osseous lesion, metastatic cancer); who had any clinically significant condition (e.g., severe anemia or neutropenia, malnutrition, bleeding disorders, uncontrolled diabetes); and who were undergoing specific types of chemotherapy (e.g., bevacizumab) were eliminated from the study. The subjects were not on antibiotics at the time of sample collection. The samples were collected from patients with cancer who were referred to Dental Services, Memorial Sloan\u2010Kettering Cancer Center, for treatment for surgical procedures as part of their standard of care treatment. The samples were surgical debridement of bone and were obtained by sequestrectomy. Thus, no surgical procedure specific to this study was performed, and no additional material was collected from patients. The written informed consent was obtained from 12 patients with cancer selected for this study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Memorial Sloan\u2010Kettering Cancer Center and New York University School of Medicine Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects. The demographic and clinicopathological data of the subjects were summarized in Table 1. All the samples were collected using sterile procedure and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

The top three genera ranked among the BRONJ group were Streptococcus (29%), Eubacterium (9%), and Pseudoramibacter (8%), while in the control group were Parvimonas (17%), Streptococcus (15%), and Fusobacterium (15%) (Figure 5). Actinomyces are usually considered as opportunistic pathogens, and many species in this genus have been reported to be associated with periodontal disease, osteomyelitis, as well as BRONJ (Fine et al, 1999; Slots and Ting, 1999; Tonetti and Mombelli, 1999; Hansen et al, 2006; Estilo et al, 2008; Naik and Russo, 2009).

These data suggested that with larger sample size, a more precise estimate of phylotype richness would be possible. However, the Shannon index, which indicates rarity and commonness of species, indicated that control and BRONJ had high species evenness and richness. The diversity of bacteria in the control group (H\u2032 = 3.83 \u00b1 0.1) was greater than that in BRONJ group (H\u2032 = 3.71 \u00b1 0.1).

The Good\u2019s coverage and evenness index indicated that our sequencing results covered 85% of species present in BRONJ samples, and the individuals (species) were distributed more evenly in BRONJ group than the controls.

            "text": "There are many hypotheses for BRONJ pathogenesis (Allen and Burr, 2009) the manifestation of necrotic bone resulting from BP\u2010induced remodeling suppression that allow accumulation of non\u2010viable osteocytes, direct cytotoxic effect of BPs on osteocytes, BPs antiangiogenic effects, and role of oral bacteria. Our observations indicated that the BRONJ bone was colonized by bacteria, and the bacterial phylotypes were different from other bone infections in the oral cavity not associated with BP therapy. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant cause of osteomyelitis, and the composition of local flora may allow other pathogens access to the bone; however, in our study, we did not detect any S. aureus which indicated that there may be other oral bacteria which can trigger bone infection in BRONJ. Bacterial profile of our control group was similar to other jawbone infection like caries and periodontal disease (Dewhirst et al, 2010). The BRONJ group had totally different bacterial phylotypes that are not associated with other jawbone infections (Table 2), but are known to cause other opportunistic infections. The plausible basis for BRONJ development is also the increased bacterial adhesion to the BP\u2010covered bone (Allen and Burr, 2009; Kos and Luczak, 2009). Kos and Luczak (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011) proposed that BRONJ may result from increased bacterial adhesion to bone coated with BPs. In their mouse models, zoledronic acid promoted the adherence and proliferation of S. mutans to hydroxyapatite, suggesting that zoledronic acid may increase bacterial infection. They further suggested that this could be mediated by proteins termed \u2018microbial surface components which recognize adhesive matrix molecules\u2019 (MSCRAMM) and that the binding of gram\u2010positive strains was attributed to the amino\u2010terminal domain of MSCRAMM structure that may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of infection (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011). Similarly, in our studies, we observed that BRONJ bone was colonized by bacteria which were different from bone infections that were not associated with BP, indicating that BP may play a significant role in bacterial colonization of jawbone. The cationic amino group of nitrogen\u2010containing BPs may attract bacteria by direct electrostatic interaction, through a direct surface protein interaction or by providing an amino acid mimic on the surface of the bony hydroxyapatite that interacts with MSCRAMM component and mediates increased bacterial adhesion (Kos and Luczak, 2009; Kos, 2011). We did not observe high number of S. mutans, but we did observe high number of organisms that belong to genus Streptococcus and other organisms such as Oribacterium. It is also hypothesized that the bone is healthy until it is injured and infected with specific oral bacteria, and reduced resorptive ability caused by BP hinders the formation of new bone or there may be vascular damage caused by BP (Street et al, 2002; Aspenberg, 2006; Bi et al, 2010). Infection could contribute to BRONJ by enhancing osteoclast\u2010independent bone resorption. BRONJ tissue consistently shows a prevalence of scalloped bone surfaces, a seemingly paradoxical property, given the effect of BPs on bone resorption. Bacteria and associated fibroblast\u2010like cells have the capacity to directly resorb bone, independent of osteoclasts, by liberating various acids and proteases (Allen and Burr, 2009).",

In humans, acidic environments are common in infections and wound healing after surgical procedures. pH values less than 6.2 are common during infections, which may further enhance the growth of aciduric bacteria. In either case, there is an infectious environment that plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of BRONJ, and other factors such as dental infections, invasive procedures, and nitrogen\u2010containing amino\u2010BPs can act as initiators of BRONJ (Otto et al, 2010). At this stage, it is not known whether bacteria colonize and promote the lesion, or whether they colonize after the lesion has developed.
