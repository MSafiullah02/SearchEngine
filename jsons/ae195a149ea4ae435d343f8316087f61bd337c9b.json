            "text": "Biopharmaceuticals are of increasing importance in the treatment of a variety of diseases. A remaining concern associated with their production is the potential introduction of adventitious agents into their manufacturing process, which may compromise the pathogen safety of a product and potentially cause stock-out situations for important medical supplies. To ensure the safety of biological therapeutics, regulatory guidance requires adventitious agent testing (AAT) of the bulk harvest. AAT is a deliberately promiscuous assay procedure which has been developed to indicate, ideally, the presence of any viral contaminant. One of the most important cell lines used in the production of biopharmaceuticals is Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and while viral infections of CHO cells have occurred, a systematic screen of their virus susceptibility has never been published. We investigated the susceptibility of CHO cells to infection by 14 different viruses, including members of 12 families and representatives or the very species that were implicated in previously reported production cell infections. Based on our results, four different infection outcomes were distinguished, based on the possible combinations of the two factors (i) the induction, or not, of a cytopathic effect and (ii) the ability, or not, to replicate in CHO cells. Our results demonstrate that the current AAT is effective for the detection of viruses which are able to replicate in CHO cells. Due to the restricted virus susceptibility of CHO cells and the routine AAT of bulk harvests, our results provide re-assurance for the very high safety margins of CHO cell-derived biopharmaceuticals.",

Many of these proteins were initially isolated from tissues or blood of human or other animal origin and had significant viral safety concerns associated with their use. In the 1980s, the first recombinant medicinal products from mammalian cell cultures have become available (for review see Grillberger et al., 2009 ) and since then, production of therapeutics in cell lines has become prevalent, with more than 165 biopharmaceuticals now approved world-wide (Walsh, 2006) . The use of transformed cell lines for the manufacture of therapeutic proteins greatly reduced the risk of human virus transmission, yet other safety concerns arose with the possibility that adventitious agents might be introduced into the manufacturing process through raw materials or personnel. To assure product safety, several measures are in place to minimize the risk of adventitious agent introduction, such as (i) control of the raw material source, (ii) testing of raw materials and the bulk harvest at appropriate stages during the manufacturing process, to confirm absence of adventitious agents (\u00bcadventitious agent testing, AAT) and (iii) implementation of virusinactivation and removal steps.",

The wells were then refilled with 6 mL of CHO medium (Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS [Gibco, Invitrogen, Lofer, Austria], L-glutamine [2 mM], nonessential amino acids [1\u00c2], sodium pyruvate [1 mM] and Gentamycin sulfate [100 mg/ml]) and plates were incubated for 7 AE 1 days at 36 AE 28C and 4.5 AE 0.5% CO 2 , when the CPE on CHO cells was assessed. Consecutively, 2 mL of CHO cell culture supernatant were transferred onto new 6well plates seeded with CHO cells, filled to a total volume of 6 mL per well with CHO medium and incubated for a further 7 AE 1 days, as before (Fig. 1) . The presence of infectious virus was tested by titration at various stages throughout the experiment, on a virus-specific susceptible cell line (Table II) and using a TCID 50 assay (see below). Samples for titration were taken from (i) the input inoculum, (ii) the second 2 mL washing step, the CHO cell culture supernatant after incubation for (iii) 7 AE 1 days (7d) and for (iv) 2\u00c2 7 AE 1 days (14d), and for (v) the virus inoculum after 14 days of incubation at 36 AE 28C (hold control, done for selected representatives of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses) (Fig. 1) . For each virus, this setup was done in duplicate and repeated at least once.",

However, the CPE associated with hAdV infection of CHO cells was difficult to assess, as the observed cell changes were subtle and no extensive cell layer destruction occurred. The results obtained from the TCID 50 assays indicated that these viruses were able to replicate in CHO cells, which was shown by the high infectious virus concentrations obtained after the 7 AE 1 days incubation, as well as after the re-inoculation and second 7 AE 1 days incubation ( Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table I ). Similar to the CPE results obtained for hAdV, no clear replication was observed for this virus: the load of infectious virus particles did not increase significantly between the second wash and the supernatant after 7 and 14 days of incubation but remained stable at a mean of 3.0-3.6 log 10 [TCID 50 ] throughout the experiment ( Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table I ). The hAdV hold control showed that this virus is robust (load of 4.3 log 10 [TCID 50 ] after 14 days at 36 AE 28C, compared to an input of 5.2 log 10 [TCID 50 ]), suggesting that infectivity detected after 14 days of incubation might be due to residual input virus. As the results obtained with hAdV were difficult to interpret, this virus was included in the routine AAT, to determine whether hAdV can unmistakably be detected in a contaminated sample. During AAT, the supernatant of CHO cells that had been inoculated and incubated with hAdV for 14 days was added to CHO, MRC-5, Vero and 324K cells. A clear CPE was observed on these cell lines after 14 days of incubation, with the exception of CHO cells (Table III) . This lack of a CPE on CHO cells during AAT is a further indication that hAdV is not able to reproduce on CHO cells efficiently, an observation that has been reported previously (Condon et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, an Adenovirus-permissive CHO cell clone has been described (Condon et al., 2003) and contamination of CHO cells by these viruses cannot be ruled out. In addition to the detection of hAdV through the induction of a CPE on various cell lines during AAT, the presence of hAdV was clearly shown by HA, as a positive result was obtained with the supernatant of MRC-5 cells (Table III) .",

However, no or rather variable virus replication was observed, characterized by the presence of no or very little infectious virus after the first 7 AE 1 days of CHO cell incubation and a subsequent variable replication during the second 7 AE 1 days of incubation, which resulted, for example, in the detection of virus loads of <0.9 and 5.4 log 10 [TCID 50 ] for replicates of the same virus (CVV, Fig. 2B , Supplementary Table I) . For the Influenza A virus FPV a clear CPE was already observed during the first few days of incubation, yet infectious virus was not detected on the susceptible cell line throughout the course of the experiment. This might have been due to an ability of FPV to initially replicate in CHO cells, which through the induction of a CPE quickly became selflimiting. Subsequently, the thermosensitive progeny virus was inactivated in the CHO supernatant and therefore no infectivity could be detected after re-inoculation on CHO cells and titration on the susceptible cell line. However, this explanation remains speculative and further studies would be required to investigate this observation in more detail.",

In the case of PRV and PPV, some residual infectivity was detected after the first 7 AE 1 days incubation (mean of four replicates: 1.3 and 2.0 log 10 [TCID 50 ], respectively), which was reduced to no detectable infectivity after the second 7 AE 1 days incubation for PRV and to 1.1 log 10 [TCID 50 ] for PPV (Fig. 2D , Supplementary  Table I ). This remaining infectivity was most likely due to the robustness of the viruses, as, for example, the viral load of the PPV hold control was 2.2 log 10 [TCID 50 ] after 14 days at 36 AE 28C, compared to a virus input of 5.0 log 10 [TCID 50 ].",

Although experimental infection of CHO cells with Porcine circovirus, a member of the Circoviridae, has been shown (Misinzo et al., 2006) , this virus was not included in the present screen, as the previously published experiments showed no productive replication in CHO cells and no substantial safety concerns are therefore expected from this virus. For Vesivirus 2117, a member of the Caliciviridae and the virus that was implicated in the most recent widely visible cell culture contamination (Genzyme, 2009 ), a clearly visible CPE on CHO cells had previously been described (Oehmig, et al., 2003) and the virus is therefore detectable during manufacture and AAT. However, this recent contamination of a manufacturing facility painfully underlines that a remaining risk of such events still exists.",
