Vitamin D is variably inversely associated with multiple health outcomes and mortality (although these associations may not be causal) [9]. Most vitamin D results from production in the skin following exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Individuals with dark skin have, on average, lower concentrations of blood vitamin D because the melanin in dark skin does not absorb as much UV [10]. Furthermore, deficiency is more common in high latitude countries such as the UK. Whilst most chronic conditions have not been improved by vitamin D supplementation, a recent meta-analysis of randomised trials suggested vitamin D may lessen the risk of acute respiratory infections [11].",
