[3] [4] [5] [6] The surge in health care demands for patients with severe COVID-19 across the United States has been overwhelming due to multiple factors, 3 including viral transmission, patient volume, patient acuity, and the requirements for strict infection control. [7] [8] The purpose of this freestanding editorial is to highlight the significant effects of the coronavirus crisis on fellowship training in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology across the United States. This perspective will describe this landscape and suggest solutions for the program leadership to navigate this crisis successfully in a flexible and resilient fashion. The references provide further detail for program directors and their teams to manage the demands of the pandemic in their respective fellowship programs.",

            "text": "The severity of a health system's response to the COVID-19 crisis has been classified into one of three stages by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) (full details available at www.acgme.org/covid-19, last accessed April 2 nd 2020). Stage 1 has been termed 'business as usual,' reflecting a time period during which the health system is not significantly affected by the coronavirus crisis. In this stage there has been little disruption of patient care or fellow educational, but the hospital and departmental leadership have begun planning for the anticipated increased clinical load. While the fellowship is still governed by the usual common and specific program requirements, certain ACGME activities will be suspended including surveys, the self-study, and site visits. [9] [10] The duration of the first stage is determined by the local trajectory of the pandemic in a given health system and region. [11] [12] As the number of infected patients and subsequent clinical demands increase, the health system will enter Stage 2, during which some educational activities are suspended and some fellows are shifted to patient care duties outside of their fellowship area to help shoulder the clinical burden of the health system's pandemic response. Although the 4 fellowship continues to be governed by the existing common and specific program requirements, the ACGME has also added some qualifiers, including the provision of adequate resources and training, adequate supervision, the maintenance of professionalism standards, and the preservation of existing work hour limits (full details available at www.acgme.org/covid-19, last accessed April 2nd 2020). Board-eligible fellows may apply for and receive emergency credentialing from their respective health system so that they may function as attendings in anesthesiology to further aid in managing the increased clinical workload. However, the amount of time they spend outside of the clinical area of their fellowship may not exceed 20% of the fellowship year. While surveys, self-study, and site visits will be suspended in stage 2, fellowship programs should do their best to continue with educational activities, while accommodating for adequate social distancing and other local rules and policies regarding the size meetings or gatherings. Thankfully there are a variety of technology-based solutions that allow for the continuation of educational activities under such restrictions, including remote video-and audio-conferencing technology, internet-based resources, and similar innovative tools.",

In this crisis mode, the fellowship is governed by the following four overriding requirements: respect for work hour limits; the provision of adequate resources and training; maintenance of adequate supervision; and the potential for fellows to function as attendings in their core specialty of anesthesiology. The other 5 requirements for Stages 1 and 2, as well as for the fellowship subspecialty, are waived during",

Thus, the decision as to whether an individual fellow will graduate from a training program is up to the program director and larger clinical competency committee irrespective of whether all minimum case numbers have been met. 10;13;15 The ACGME has also stated that the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on fellowship case logs will be taken into account when program reviews eventually restart (full details available at www.acgme.org/covid-19, last accessed April 3 rd 2020).",

Additional factors that may aggravate stress include marital status, number of children, and perceived level of exposure, although the evidence is not consistent about these issues.

[24] [25] [26] [27] After quarantine has ended, ongoing 8 stressors that may slow psychological recovery include financial losses and the effects of social stigma. 24 Since the effects of quarantine may occur through all phases of the COVID-19 response, program directors should consider processes to recognize and manage these issues in their fellows. Interventions that may minimize the effects of quarantine and social distancing include a focused approach to the fellows with regular, open communication, frequent information sharing, adequate supplies and personal protective equipment, as well an emphasis on collective responsibility and teamwork.
