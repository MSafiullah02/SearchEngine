At present in the United States, all tests currently cleared for diagnostic use by the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) are serologic assays. The current guidelines for serologic testing were adopted in 1994 [3]. The challenge to the 1994 Dearborn Conference [3] participants was to develop testing and interpretive guidelines that would standardize serologic testing for diagnostic purposes. The guidelines are geared to assess exposure to B. burgdorferi through the patient\u2019s antibody response to infection rather than direct detection of nucleic acid or protein from the microbe. The limitations of serologic testing and advances were recently reported in detail [4].",

Also immunoglobulin M reactivity is fraught with issues that affect utility. Culture of the pathogen, microbial nucleic acid, or protein may be detected in skin biopsies of erythema migrans (EM) before the development of a positive serology. However, culture is impractical for routine clinical use. It requires specialized media; B. burgdorferi grows slowly, requiring weeks before it comes detectable. Although improvements in serologic assays are foreseeable, current assays utilize antigen targets identified before a thorough understanding of the expression of the antigens or their epitopes. Key early antigen targets were missing from the assays, contributing to insensitivity of serology in early infection. Also, cross-reactive epitopes are found in virtually all of the antigens used in the currently approved seroassays.",

In the absence of EM, the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are too nonspecific to be clinically diagnostic. In a patient who has the viral-like symptoms of early Lyme disease without EM, serologic tests may not yet be positive.

A direct test for Lyme disease is needed, but a sensitive and specific antigen-capture assay has been elusive.

In addition, because of the high sequence variability between B. burgdorferi strains, identification of conserved antigenic epitopes that span all strains at all times has been challenging across genospecies. One can select 1 or more appropriate target antigens for any genospecies. Even OspC, known for its variability, has at least 2 well-conserved epitope targets found across the various serotypes.",

Although some large commercial laboratories use mass spectrometry for diagnostic purposes (not Lyme disease), this methodology can be used to identify and validate the specific antibody\u2013antigen complex so that simpler assays can be developed for use in routine laboratory settings or perhaps even closer to the point of care. In addition, emerging antigen concentration and enrichment methods [14, 15] have the potential to address another likely limitation\u2014B. burgdorferi-specific antigens are probably in very low abundance in body fluids. Throughout the B. burgdorferi infection, there are few circulating organisms, and the organism burden in affected organs is low. Concentration methods can be categorized as follows: removal of solute or water [16], electrophoretic or chromatographic separation [17], and affinity capture [18\u201320]. Along with target enrichment, these methods may require exclusion of masking proteins such as common abundant proteins (frequently a preparative step prior to mass spectrometry detection of proteins).",

Many pathogens are easily detected using NAATs, especially with high enhancement or enrichment methods when present. Many polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been geared to analyze small volumes of blood, plasma, or other sample types. In Lyme disease, outside the EM in skin, the infectious agent resides in very low numbers in tissue and body fluids, and standard PCR methods, as applied to B. burgdorferi detection, have suffered from poor sensitivity, especially in blood and cerebrospinal fluid [21\u201325]. An illustrative strategy to increase PCR sensitivity without diminishing specificity is to start with a larger specimen volume and/or use target enrichment methods [26]. It appears possible to detect B. burgdorferi in the blood with higher sensitivity [27] in early Lyme disease. In addition, there are a variety of PCR-based assays in development that use unconventional signal detection or amplification methods [27, 28], with the potential to achieve a limit of detection (LOD) that is substantially lower than with standard PCR methods.",

For an improved Lyme disease assay, performance should be equal to or better than the existing serologic 2-tier enzyme immunoassay followed by Western blot.

These infections have many genomic copies detectable by methodology geared to small volumes of blood or plasma. In contrast, Lyme disease has very low microbe numbers in the majority of clinical samples. With enhancement and enrichment methods, detection of B. burgdorferi in the blood is increasingly possible. Multiple displacement amplification [26] and similar strategies in which DNA is exponentially amplified by isothermal amplification increases the yield of B. burgdorferi by at least 200 times above normal [27]. This makes a PCR detection assay far more sensitive. In other studies, the sensitivity of PCR-based assays was increased, on the order of 16000-fold, by combining 3 consecutive methods [27]. Similar to the approach used for blood cultures for sepsis where multiple large volumes of blood are taken, the first step was to start with a larger volume of whole blood, 1.25 mL (more than 0.5 mL of plasma or serum are often requested by clinical laboratories). The second step was to increase the relative content of B. burgdorferi compared to human or other microbial DNA by using targeted isothermal amplification. In vitro experiments resulted in a 200- to 2000-fold increase in the targeted DNA. In a set of clinical EM samples, the number of cases detected was 7-fold greater than without this step. The third step that increased sensitivity with 100% specificity was the use of multiple primers. It should be noted that there appear to be skin-restricted genotypes, which may be the reason for negative results in blood. We should also consider enrichment or concentration of a pathogen to increase the target concentration for nucleic acid extraction followed by PCR analysis.",

The approximately 1.7 Mb Bbl. genome is AT-rich (approximately 30%), and nearly half of it consists of linear and circular plasmids. Borrelia burgdorferi isolates an average of 17 such plasmids, with up to 21 for the B31 type strain [33]. Thus, Borrelia genomes are among the most complex and challenging bacterial human\u2013pathogenic genomes to sequence and analyze. These difficult-to-sequence plasmids carry antigen-encoding genes and are often required for propagation of the bacteria in ticks and/or mammals. The recent development of long-read sequencing technology [34] (eg, Pacific Biosciences), in combination with the use of HTS technologies with relatively very low sequencing error rates (eg, Illumina Novae or MiSeq platforms) [34\u201336], has allowed resolution of the repeated sequences that are the hallmark of Borrelia genomes and of other sequencing challenges commonly found in the critically important Borrelia plasmids.",

When testing guidelines for Lyme disease were adopted in 1994, they were intended to make the best use of available assays, which were antibody tests that provided indirect evidence of infection. Although the guidelines improved standardized serologic testing, aspects are amenable to improvement in light of new data and technologies. Continued reliance on serologic testing for early Lyme disease is suboptimal given the common 2\u20133 week seronegative window with current methods and the need for a biomarker of active infection.",
