Liver disease, in particular, is exacerbated by alcohol use, which promotes progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. These effects are more common in persons coinfected with HIV and chronic hepatitis C or B virus.Intervention studies to reduce alcohol use in populations with HIV or at risk of HIV are clearly important, but studies have had variable results.There may be no safe level of alcohol use in HIV infection.\n",

For those who can obtain effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV/AIDS has become a chronic disease with life expectancies over 30 years [3]. Research in the last 10 years has revealed the importance of alcohol in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Alcohol use, in moderate or hazardous amounts, has been associated with increased acquisition of HIV infection, progression of HIV infection, deleterious effects on HIV treatment, and acceleration in the comorbidities of HIV infection [4\u20139]. Yet alcohol remains the \u201cforgotten drug\u201d of the HIV/AIDS epidemic [10].",

Alcohol use is higher in men and women at risk for HIV and is associated with increased sexual risk practices in Africa [48]. Even low amounts of alcohol use in women (e.g., one drink in the last month) were associated with higher risk of HIV infection [49]. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies from Africa, the odds ratio of having HIV was 1.57 for drinkers and 2.04 for problem drinkers compared to nondrinkers, when controlled for other HIV risk factors [32]. Kalichman has shown that strategies for HIV risk reduction in these settings work best through interventions targeted at decreasing alcohol use [50].",

Other studies have confirmed this association, which is particularly important in India where 80% of HIV is ascribed to heterosexual transmission [52]. While few women in India drink alcohol (compared to men), women may be at risk due to their husband\u2019s or male partners\u2019 drinking habits [53, 54]. In the Yunnan province of China, where the epidemiology of HIV has been well studied, spread of HIV has begun to shift from intravenous drug use (IDU) to sexual transmission [55]. This suggests that alcohol use may also play an important role in the spread of HIV in China, but there are no data on this at present.",

Scribner et al. developed a model called \u201cecological epidemiology\u201d that encompasses individual characteristics, social network, and the alcohol neighborhood to understand and study HIV transmission. For example, an individual who frequents a bar will be exposed to a group with multiple interrelated sexual partners and an increased prevalence of sexually transmitted disease and HIV [14].",

Among the Veterans Administration (VA) population, hazardous drinking patterns are found more frequently in African-Americans (26%) than in whites (18%, p  <  0.001) [59]. Cook et al. determined that the prevalence of moderate and hazardous drinking among women with HIV infection was also higher than in the general US population [42, 56, 57]. Other characteristics were associated with hazardous drinking patterns such as lower education, unemployment, nonwhite race, depression, and drug use. In both this cohort and in a VA cohort, hazardous alcohol use was associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [42, 60]. Among veterans with HCV infection, 35% were hazardous drinkers compared with 12% hazardous drinkers among matched controls without HCV infection [60]. The increased alcohol use among IDU and the high correlation of IDU and HCV infection likely explain this finding [46, 61].",

Lefevre et al. examined alcohol intake in a group of 111 HIV-positive patients of a university hospital clinic, mostly MSM. In surveys repeated every 6 months for a mean follow-up of 30 months, the frequency of drinking decreased from 6.4 to 3.9 drinks/week (p  <  0.001) [63]. In the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, lower alcohol use was found in those who had been on ART for longer periods of time [64]. Cook analyzed data from the Women\u2019s Interagency HIV study (WIHS) on 2,770 HIV-positive women followed for 11 years [42]. There was a slight, approximately 5%, decrease in hazardous drinking over time but no change in the overall amount of drinking, possibly as some switched categories from hazardous to nonhazardous drinking. However, there was a significant decrease in alcohol consumption among women who were coinfected with hepatitis C and HIV from 31% with hazardous drinking patterns in 1995 to 10% in 2006.",

            "text": "One of the central ways alcohol intake adversely affects HIV disease is by decreasing adherence to ART. Adherence to ART is key to suppression of HIV replication, prevention of developing drug resistance, and long-term survival [66]. This has been well documented among all subgroups with HIV infection [6, 64, 65, 67\u201371]. While there are few studies of adherence in developing countries, one study from India confirms the association of alcohol use and risk of nonadherence or discontinuation of ART medications [72]. Convincingly, there is a dose\u2013response relationship between alcohol intake and adherence, with higher amounts of alcohol or more hazardous drinking being associated with poorer measures of adherence. Samet et al. found that the amount of alcohol consumption was the strongest predictor of adherence with highest levels of adherence being found in those abstinent from alcohol compared to moderate use or at-risk use [70]. Chander et al., studying nearly 2,000 HIV-infected persons receiving care at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, found that adherence was 22% lower in moderate alcohol users and 54% lower in hazardous alcohol users compared to no alcohol use. Adherence was further decreased by 68% with concurrent drug use [65].",

            "text": "There may be several reasons for lower adherence in persons who use alcohol. Drinking pattern affects the likelihood of noncompliance. Braithwaite et al., studying 2,700 members of The Veterans Administration Aging Cohort Study (VACS), found that abstainers missed ART on 2% of days. Non-binge drinkers missed medication on 4% of drinking days and post-drinking days but only on 2% of nondrinking days. Binge drinkers, in contrast, missed ART on 11% of drinking days, 5.5% of post-drinking days, and 4% on nondrinking days [6]. Therefore, while medication adherence was lower on drinking days for binge and non-binge drinkers, missing medications was increased twofold among binge drinkers on days they were either not drinking or post-drinking. This suggests that \u00adnonadherence was also due to factors not directly related to alcohol but related to characteristics \u00adcommon among binge drinkers [6]. Sankar et al. studied beliefs about alcohol and ART medication interactions in a group of African-American patients treated for HIV [71]. Over three quarters of those surveyed felt that \u201calcohol and ART do not mix\u201d; one-third attributed this to alcohol making ART ineffective and another third felt that alcohol made ART more toxic. In this study, participants reported purposely skipping ART doses when they drank, with light drinkers skipping 64% of the times when they drank and moderate drinkers 55% of the times. However, heavy drinkers skipped ART only 29% of the time when they drank and reported that they felt no ill effects from drinking and taking ART [71]. Thus, medication adherence is determined by amount of alcohol intake, drinking pattern (binge or non-binge drinking), and beliefs about the safety of alcohol combined with ART. Issues of medication adherence and alcohol are further discussed in Chap. 18 and in a meta-analysis by Hendershot [17].",

In rhesus macaques inoculated with SIV infection, SIV replication was 31- to 85-fold higher in monkeys with chronic alcohol ingestion compared to controls [21]. SIV replication persisted in the central nervous system of alcohol-fed monkeys but was undetectable in control monkeys. Poonia et al. proposed that the mechanism of alcohol\u2019s effect on SIV replication is through its effect on intestinal lymphocytes since the small intestine is one of the most lymphocyte-rich organs. Alcohol-fed monkeys had lower numbers of CD8 cells (before and after SIV infection) and higher numbers of CD4 cells in the small intestine after SIV infection. They suggested that the 1\u20132 log10 increase in SIV replication in alcohol-fed monkeys occurs because of the increase in number of CD4 cells susceptible to SIV infection in the small intestine and reduction in CD8 cells which may control SIV replication [22]. Chronic alcohol ingestion also altered the course of HIV infection with alcohol-fed monkeys having lower CD4 cell counts, lower caloric intake, higher TNF-alpha expression, and a more rapid progression to end-stage SIV disease (mean 374 days compared to 900 days in controls) [23, 24].",

However, two well-controlled, longitudinal studies since the introduction of combination ART have shown that alcohol is associated with HIV disease progression. Samet et al. studied alcohol use in 595 participants in the MACS cohort over 7 years [82]. Heavy alcohol use was associated with a lower mean CD4 cell count (by \u223c50 cells/mL) but not a decline in CD4 percentage or HIV viral load when adjusted for adherence. Baum et al. studied 231 HIV-positive persons followed for 2.5 years [5]. Frequent alcohol users of  \u2265  2 drinks/day were almost 3 times more likely to develop a CD4 count  \u2264  200 cells/mL, which is an AIDS-defining event. This effect was particularly marked in alcohol users not on ART whose risk of developing a CD4 count  \u2264  200 cells/mL was nearly 8 times nondrinkers. In this study, alcohol use was associated with higher HIV viral load in those on ART but not in those without ART. These results suggest that the effect of alcohol on HIV viral load is mediated through adherence. However, the effect of alcohol in lowering absolute CD4 count rather than percentage could be influenced by the splenomegaly and secondary lymphopenia seen with alcoholism and chronic viral hepatitis [83]. Moderate to heavy alcohol use has also been associated with increased HIV viral shedding in the female genital tract after controlling for plasma viral load [20] suggesting that alcohol may affect HIV transmission by physiological as well as behavioral risk factors.",

Using data on ART adherence in the VACS cohort, Braithwaite et al. developed a model simulating survival based on levels of alcohol consumption (nondrinkers, hazardous drinkers consuming  \u2265  5 drinks on drinking days, and nonhazardous drinkers) [84]. The model predicted decreased survival by >1 year in nonhazardous drinkers drinking at least once a week, 3.3 years in nonhazardous drinkers drinking daily, and up to 6.4 years in hazardous drinkers drinking daily. However, the VACS index, subsequently developed to predict decreases in life expectancy based on HIV and non-HIV characteristics, does not include a separate variable for alcohol or drug abuse beyond adjusting for severity of liver disease and coexisting HCV infection [85]. In addition, a longitudinal study of changes in physical function with age in the same cohort did not show an effect of alcohol [86]. Further longitudinal studies in this cohort and others should define the impact of alcohol use on survival in HIV.",

Persons with coinfection with chronic hepatitis have accelerated liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis [9, 94]. In a study of liver histology of IDU who had acquired HCV infection, those with concurrent HIV infection developed cirrhosis in a mean of 6.9 years after infection compared to 23.2 years among HCV mono-infected persons (p  <  0.001) [95]. Persons with coinfection also have an increased risk of death from end-stage liver disease [96\u201399]. They are also at higher risk for drug-induced hepatotoxicity from ART [100, 101] which may be related to altered cytochrome metabolism with progressive liver disease [102]. Other metabolic abnormalities are more common in coinfected persons including hyperglycemia, diabetes, and bacterial translocation from the small intestine to the portal system, predisposing coinfected chronic inflammation and progressive liver disease [103\u2013105].",

Studies have shown that alcohol use is a risk factor for the development of pneumonia in the absence of HIV, as well as more severe, multilobar pneumonia and more virulent pathogens including Candida, gram-negative bacteria, and Staphylococcus aureus infections. This, in turn, leads to longer hospitalizations and increased mortality related to alcohol use [141]. The risk for adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a mortality of 40\u201360% [142], is increased three- to fourfold in those with heavy alcohol intake [143, 144].",

These include brief interventions as well as more intensive behavioral, social network, and medication interventions. Brief interventions, also referred to as brief motivational interviews, are typically a single session discussing the patients\u2019 alcohol use. Studies employing this type of intervention often involve exploration of the pros and cons of a patient\u2019s alcohol use, self-assessment of the patient\u2019s alcohol consumption severity, and a more formal assessment of the patient\u2019s alcohol consumption as compared to the general population [150]. More extensive behavioral interventions have also been investigated, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivation enhancement, or 12-step programs. Each of these behavioral interventions is directly aimed at investigating personal motivation behind alcohol consumption and developing personal behavior modification strategies [151]. These interventions typically require multiple sessions. In addition to individualized plans and programs for those with increased alcohol consumption, social network and structural interventions which target larger populations and communities have also been evaluated. Social network interventions have most commonly focused on employing influential community leaders to change specific behaviors or promote health-conscious decisions. These studies, often referred to as Popular Opinion Leader (POL) or peer-based model interventions, may be particularly effective in communities that are difficult for outside researchers to impact [152]. Alternatively, structural interventions, which may include political and legal action, may also be effective in altering individuals\u2019 behavior and environment. Lastly, medications, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate, have been shown to decrease alcohol consumption via physiologic effects, including decreasing cravings or causing adverse reactions when alcohol is consumed [149].",

The first is the setting in which the interventions are conducted. Interventions have been conducted in various settings including primary care clinics [153, 154], hospital inpatient settings [155], emergent care settings [156], and social settings or drinking venues (places where alcohol is served) [13]. A second important factor to consider is the population being targeted, which may vary depending on severity of alcohol use (dependent vs. nondependent drinkers), geographic region, and cultural practices around drinking. A third factor to consider is the outcome that is being targeted. For example, previous trials have examined the effects of alcohol interventions on decreasing alcohol consumption, improving adherence to antiretroviral medication and/or reducing sexual risk behaviors. The combination of the type of intervention, the setting in which the intervention is implemented, the population that is being targeted, and the expected outcomes of the trial will all contribute to the success or failure of an intervention.",

For example, one study targeting MSM in the USA with alcohol use disorders combined two types of interventions (motivational interviewing and peer-group education/support strategies) and examined the effects on reducing at-risk drinking and sexual risk behaviors [157]. In this study, individuals receiving the combined intervention reported significantly lower number of days of drinking and number of heavy drinking days per 30-day period compared to control participants. Another study tested the effects of a brief theory-based behavioral HIV\u2013alcohol risk-reduction intervention on sexual risk behaviors in men and women recruited from informal drinking establishments in a suburban township of Capetown, South Africa [50]. The authors reported significant reductions in unprotected intercourse, increased use of condoms, and less use of alcohol before sex in the intervention group compared to controls, with the largest impacts among lighter drinkers. These two studies illustrate the success of individual counseling interventions for reducing risk behaviors around alcohol consumption among persons at risk for or living with HIV.",

A study in the VA population showed that the sensitivity for health-care providers\u2019 ability to diagnose hazardous drinking was only 22% [163]. Thus far, trials of interventions to reduce hazardous drinking in populations affected by HIV have shown mixed results. The underdiagnosis of hazardous alcohol use and lack of proven, effective treatment strategies raise the question of whether there is any \u201csafe\u201d level of alcohol intake in HIV. Justice et al. examined the relationship of medical illness related to alcohol use in veterans with HIV infection [164]. For diseases associated with alcohol use (HCV infection, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, and certain infections), there was a linear relationship between alcohol intake category (none, moderate, hazardous) and the disease. This suggests that there may be no \u201csafe\u201d level of alcohol intake for HIV-infected persons [165]. More aggressive screening and treatment of alcohol-related disorders is clearly warranted to prevent HIV transmission and to improve treatment and outcomes of persons with HIV infection [84].",
