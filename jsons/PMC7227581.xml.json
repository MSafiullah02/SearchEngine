            "text": "Current and last two decades saw emergence of zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) crossing the species barrier ultimately infecting human species resulting in pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [1,2]. An apocalyptic threat is posed by a sempiternal pathogen ruining the health and the economies on global scale. A severe pneumonia outbreak starting in December, 2019 in the Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China was caused by novel CoV referred as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d [3,4]. CoVs are RNA viruses with wide host pathogenesis in mammals including humans, pangolins and birds. Genetically the CoVs were categorised into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [5]. The alpha and beta CoVs infect mammals whereas the gamma and delta CoVs infect birds [6]. Primary symptoms associated with CoV infection include respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases. Previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of CoVs (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) which can infect the human species. HCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E belongs to alphaCoV genus while rest belongs to betaCoV genus. [6]. The betaCoVs appears to be prima-facie genre of CoVs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades. Recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreak spread from China to the intercontinental arena and already infected 0.3 million people globally claiming \u223c13000 (\u223c4.3%) deaths till 21st March 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). China and Italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future. Genome sequence analysis of SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV confirmed its presence in betaCoVs family and divergence from the other two viruses [4]. The 2019-nCoV is a positive-strand RNA viruses with \u223c29 Kb genome size, 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) [7]. Viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and 3\u20135 nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genome starts with short untranslated regions (5\u2019 UTR) followed by genes 5\u2032-replicase (rep gene), S, E, M, N and 3\u2019 UTR [7]. Two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5\u2019 end which encodes for non-structural protein (Nsp). Spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre [8,9]. Viral assembly relies primarily on M and E proteins and RNA synthesis is achieved by action of N protein [7].",

A dire need is to unravel the mutations in the viral genome and concomitant amino acid changes occurring presumably due to varying geographical location or upon interaction with the diverse human immune system. Various reports compared the SARS, MERS, bat and pangolin coronaviruses and paved way for significant findings, still leaving a lacunae in terms of the variations in the hCoV genomes and comparison with the previous available viruses resources.

Alignment of hCoV with above mentioned viruses showed that several nucleotide sites were unique in hCoV sequences when compared to other coronaviruses (Table S1). Among these sites, C:T (hCoV :other coronavirus) is the most prevalent substitution followed by T:C, G:A and A:G (Table S1). Many regions were absent in bat and SARS coronavirus genome when compared to hCoV, bat-hCoV and pangolin-hCoV. Among these regions, one of largest portion is of 391 nt (28026-28417) coding for ORF8 protein in hCoV putatively involved in interspecies transmission [17]. Genomic similarities and alignment indicate that several mutation events over the time is responsible for emergence of human novel coronavirus. Further a phylogenetic analysis between these viruses displayed that hCoVs are closer to bat/SARS-like virus (MG772933.1) and distant from SARS coronavirus (KY352407.1) and bat coronavirus (GU190215.1) (Fig. 1\n).

However, few exceptions were also from South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Chile, USA, India, Belgium, Spain, Germany and France hCoVs. Group III mainly comprised of the hCoVs belonging to USA while Group IV represented the hCoVs of mixed type population belonging to several countries distributed over continents. Group V possess the hCoV from European countries along with few hCoVs of America and one from Taiwan. To understand mystery underlying the clustering pattern of the hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV were used as a reference sequence to observe the nucleotide substitution in hCoV members in different groups. Interestingly, hCoV members (Group II and Group III) falling in proximity to Group I have less substitution in the genome sequences (Table S2). The T:C (GroupV-hCoV:bat-hCoV and GroupV-hCoV:pangolin-hCoV) substitution were frequent in Group V as compared to hCoV representing other groups (Table S2). The genomic signature of USA-hCoVs present in Group V is very different from USA-hCoVs of Group III. This could be indicative of differences between direct and community transmission of the virus. Member belonging to each subgroup has distinct genomic features in terms of nucleotide substitution (Table S2).",

            "text": "The 57 amino acid changes were distributed over 12 regions in the \u223c30 kb genome. The number of amino acids substitutions varied between different regions such as 7 in Nsp2, 10 in Nsp3, 5 in Nsp4, 3 in Nsp6, 1 in Nsp12, 4 in Nsp13, 11 in Spike, 3 in ORF3a, 2 in ORF5, 1 in ORF6, 2 in ORF8 and 8 in ORF9 (Fig. 4\n). Intriguingly, various important non-synonymous mutations were observed majorly in European and US continent while the mutations were mostly synonymous in Asian continent. These interesting observations can be used to infer the reason behind larger infectivity and pathogenicity in these regions (Table S3). Further two type of amino acid change viz., conservative and radial replacements were intensively studied with respect to previous reports stating the effect of such changes on the enzymatic activities. Mutations were most prevalent in the spike region followed by Nsp2, Nsp3 and ORF9 (N) (Table S3). Spike region determines the specific binding to host receptor and initiation of viral replication. This region is reported to be the most potent and indispensable for viral attachment and entry into host system. The RRAR amino acids found only in the human CoVs spike region has proved to be essential for binding to host receptor [18]. We observed similar region in the hCoV genomes studied (23713-23724 region in nucleotide alignment), although there was mutation in two hCoV-England nucleotide sequences (CTCCGCGGCGGG in place of CTCCTCGGCGGG) but the resulting amino acid remained same in all hCoV genomes. These findings corroborate the essentiality of RRAR sequence for viral infection to host system. We found different type of mutation in hCoV spike protein at different places such as leucine to valine (L8V), glutamine to histidine (Q675H and also found in ORF3a:Q57 H), glutamine to lysine (Q239 K) and aspartate to glycine (D614 G and also found in ORF5, D3G) might have potential role to augment viral infection (Table S3). Previous investigations showed mutations such as leucine to valine change in retroviral envelope protein, glutamine to lysine in influenza virus, glutamine to histidine and aspartate to glycine in H1N1 had a severe impact in virus entry, replication and cross infectivity to other species [[19], [20], [21]].",

This might provide an explanation why drugs used for treating HIV became a failure in case of hCoV infection [22].

            "text": "Furthermore, several amino acid changes were also observed in the non-structural proteins (Nsp) of the hCoVs which may affect the virulence and titer. Threonine to isoleucine substitution was observed in different Nsp proteins (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp3:T127I and T1030I and Nsp4:T295I) mainly in European and US samples. Earlier reports established that threonine to isoleucine substitution increased viral infectivity of Ebola virus and resistance to ganciclovir in human cytomegalovirus [23,24]. Importantly, alanine to valine substitution in non-structural protein, NS2A in Zika virus affects viral RNA synthesis and results in vivo viral attenuation [25]. This mutated virus also induce a comprehensive protection against lethal challenge proposed by the wild type Zika virus. Falling in similar lines alanine to valine substitutions in non-structural proteins (Nsp3, A1187 V, Nsp4, A457 V and Nsp6, A46 V) could reduce viral lethality of hCoVs (Table S3). These mutations might pave way towards identification of less lethal strains and help to raise immunity to counteract the noxious strains. An isoleucine to valine mutation (Nsp2, I559 V and Nsp3, I797 V) and methionine to isoleucine (Nsp4, M33I) were observed in hCoVs. Change of isoleucine to valine in polymerase subunit PB2 of influenza virus resulted in critically enhanced activity of reconstituted polymerase complex [26] and M to I substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase imparted resistance to nucleoside analog 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-3\u2032thiacytidine (3TC) [27]. Interestingly, presence of a non-synonymous substitution in RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RDRP) region in majority of European hCoV samples resulted in change of amino acid from proline to leucine (P314 L). It will be quite interesting to validate the effect of this substitution on RDRP activity as one of the previous study established that similar change of proline-to-leucine substitution (P236 L) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, imparts resistance against a highly specific inhibitor bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) [28]. These examples clearly show that amino acid changes may significantly affect the functional competency of polymerase and the associated subunits.",

These mutations may vary at different geographical distribution or interaction with different host systems. Few mutations also resulted in change of amino acid which may provide an explanation for failure of previously employed antiviral therapies. This research will better equip the researchers to utilize the mutated amino acid information for drug targets in particular geography and less cases of failure. Beside the substitution resulting into transformation to a more virulent strain there are number of highly conserved regions in the hCoV genome which can be used as target for inhibitory drugs and vaccine development for a large repertoire of strains. Finally, we believe that our data provide useful information pertaining the changes in genomic and proteomic features which could serve as a guide to design the future antiviral therapies and diagnostics.",
