A containment of the population has been set up since the 17 th March 2020 and is still ongoing.",

At first sight, it seems that no influence on the development of a cellulitis is to be expected from the current containment measures. However, we think that a few hypotheses can be raised.",

With this suspension of all the routine dental care, it is likely that more patients needing emergency dental cares than usual can be seen by dentists. It probably allows patients to receive earlier adapted antibiotic therapy than usual in case of dental infections. This fact is supported by the literature: an increased proportion of infections has been showed during the epidemic in patients visiting dental urgencies [2] . On the contrary the hypothesis of a management of patients with cellulitis by private practice OMF surgeons must be rejected. Indeed, it appears that, in our area, no patients at all have been managed for that disease in private hospitals during this period.",

In France, a 60 % decrease of NSAID delivery by drug stores and pharmacies has even been observed at the end of march 2020 (i.e. from the beginning of the containment period) [5] . This fact is thought to be due to a cautionary note regarding the use of NSAID during the COVID-19 pandemic and coming from the French health authorities and broadcasted by the media [5] . Yet, the influence of NSAID on the development of cervicofacial cellulitis of odontogenic origin is still controversial today [6, 7] . The hypothesis of a diminution of the number of cellulites of odontogenic origin, due to the decrease of the use of NSAID related to the COVID-19 pandemic, must be taken into account according to us. The hypothesis of a positive role of NSAID on the development of cellulites could thus be reinforced. Further investigations, with multicentric assessment, are currently in progress.",
