Toxigenic type D P. multocida was isolated from the nasal cavities of pigs in one (2%) of 50 randomly selected herds. Toxigenic isolates were also recovered from 2 (8%) of a separate group of 25 herds that had purchased pigs from a known infected piggery in South Australia (herd SA). Snout abnormalities were present in 9.4%, 3.2% and 1.8% of grower pigs in the 3 affected herds. Isolation of toxigenic P. multocida was significantly associated (p c 0.0001) with the occurrence of clinically affected pigs in the herd. Purchase of at least 5 pigs from herd SA was associated with an elevated risk (p <",

The farm visit consisted of 3 parts. Sucker, weaner, grower and finisher pigs were clinically evaluated for signs of enzootic atrophic rhinitis (Schoss 1983) . Second, nasal swabbing, as detailed below, was carried out to determine whether a herd was infected with toxigenic P. multocida. Third, the owner or manager completed a questionnaire which characterised herd size, production systems, housing characteristics, number and sources of introduced pigs in the 2 years prior to the survey, and quarantine and antibiotic treatment practices for introduced pigs. When clinical signs of atrophic rhinitis were observed, owners indicated when they first detected disease. where C = level of confidence and P = probability that a sampled pig was infected At a prevalence of 20% and 90% confidenceievel, 10 randomly selected pigs were needed in each herd to detect at least one infected pig. However, to increase the likelihood of recovery of toxigenic P. multocida, priority was given to sampling pigs with upper respiratory tract disease or snout deformities. When the veterinarian considered all pigs in a herd were clincially normal, pigs weaned in the previous 2 weeks were swabbed. The nasal swabbing procedure was carried out as follows: external nares were wiped with 70% alcohol to remove gross contamination. Mini-tipped aluminium shafted swabs* were inserted to the caudal end of the nasal cavity, placed in Amies charcoal transport medium and despatched at ambient temperature to Regional Veterinary Laboratories. Swabs were cultured onto Pedersen's NB medium (Eamens eta1 1988) and isolates confirmed as P. multocida by standard procedures (Cowan 1974) . Capsular type and toxigenity of P. multocida isolates to bovine turbinate cells were determined (Eamens et a1 1988) .",

Associations with herd size (categories 20-50, 51-100, > 100 sows) were also not significant (p = 0.16), and commercial herds were no more likely to be affected than stud herds (p = 0.61). Toxigenic P. multocida was more likely to be isolated (p = 0.05) from herds in which all age groups (dry sows, lactating sows, weaners, growers and finishers) were housed in the same shed than those in which there was either partial or total segregation of age groups into separate sheds. A significant association existed between the number of pigs from herd SA and the number of introduced pigs from other sources (p < 0.OOOl). Owners of the 3 affected herds also had purchased more than 50 pigs from herds other than SA. Under the assumption that the number of pigs introduced from other sources was a potential confounding factor, a stratified analysis was conducted. Using this approach, purchase of more than 5 pigs from herd SA was not significantly associated (p = 0.28) with a higher isolation rate of toxigenic P. multocida. t Introduced pigs were those entering herd in the 2 years prior to sampling. Two owners did not introduce pigs during that period. $ Maximim number of sources was 6.",

The specificity of both procedures is likely to approach loo%, but nasal swabbing is of unknown sensitivity. Although not specifying test sensitivity, Rutter (1987) indicated that if 30qo of pigs had snout deformities, P. multocida could be isolated from 50-60qo of 6-to 8-week-old pigs. Pedersen (1983) , in his review of the cultural and serological diagnosis of atrophic rhinitis, made no reference to the sensitivity of nasal swabbing. Because serological tests are not available for the detection of P. multocida in pigs, nasal swabbing and culturing onto a selective medium is currently the only practical method for detecting toxigenic isolates in live pigs. The mouse inoculation test, which is a more sensitive procedure, is unacceptable because of the large numbers of mice required for routine testing (Pedersen 1983) .",

This finding is consistent with evidence from the UK (Rutter 1983; Rutter et a1 1984) and Denmark (Pedersen 1983 ) which indicated that toxigenic P. multocida could be isolated from herds with progressive disease but not from herds without a history of atrophic rhinitis. Rutter (1987) also observed that as the prevalence of clinical signs increased so did the prevalence of infection in weaner pigs. To maximise the chance of detecting infected pigs in a herd, veterinarians swabbed pigs that had snout abnormalities, were sneezing, or had nasal discharges. If infection prevalence was low and pigs did not show signs of disease, much larger samples would have been required. For example, at 1% prevalence, 229 weaner pigs would need to have been sampled in a large herd to be 90% confident of detecting at least one infected animal. Such intensive sampling would have been impractical except in a small number of herds.",

The reasons for the lower rates are speculative but include clearance of toxigenic isolates from the nasal cavities of affected pigs and suboptimal handling of swabs between collection and identification of colonies at laboratories.
