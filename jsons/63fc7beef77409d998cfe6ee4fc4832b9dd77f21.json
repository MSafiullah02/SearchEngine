            "text": "The epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) due to their influence on public health. Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife-human EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and 'spill-over' and 'spill-back'; and technology and industry for domestic animal-human EIDs. The concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities, including livestock health and production management. This chapter provides the experience gained in the control and management of a few important 2 TADs and EIDs along with the successes, constraints, limitations and future research needs for developing better control approaches.",

This general definition covers a range of infectious diseases of man and animals which pose a significant threat to both medical and veterinary public health. Among the OIE-listed diseases of viral aetiology, major changes have been experienced in the occurrence of rinderpest, peste-des-petits ruminants (PPR), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), African swine fever (ASF), lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever (RVF). Of these, rinderpest presents a success story from the 1990s to 2011 as a result of FAO, OIE, EU and IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) guided and coordinated programmes including the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC), NPRE and NREP in India (Yadav 2011) , Global Rinderpest Eradication Program (GREP) of the FAO and other national governments where the disease was endemic. These exemplary efforts led to the historic declaration of global rinderpest eradication by the FAO on June 28, 2011.",

Though all transboundary diseases are of exotic origin, all exotic diseases are not included in TAD listing. Many EIDs are also transboundary diseases. The TADs are defined as highly contagious and transmissible epidemic diseases of livestock which have the capability for rapid spread to new areas and regions regardless of national borders and have serious socio-economic and public health consequences. Nearly all diseases affect livestock, poultry, fishes and other animals and adversely impact the quality and quantity of food and other products, such as hides and skins, bones, fibres, wool and animal draft power for tilling, transport and traction. The reduction in animal production, productivity and profitability due to TADs affect the human livelihood. In the present scenario of fast-increasing globalisation, TADs represent a serious threat to the economy and welfare of the public and affected nations as they drastically reduce production and productivity; disrupt trade and travel and local and national economies; and also threaten human health through inferior food quality and zoonotic diseases/infections. As such, consequences of TADs could have a significant detrimental effect on the economy and public health of not only the affected nations but also the whole of the world.",

Among the TADs having zoonotic manifestations, a number of infectious diseases, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), BSE (Mad cow disease caused by prion), West Nile fever, Rift Valley fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus and CCHF, to name a few, adversely affecting animal and human health have been in the news in recent times (Malik and Dhama 2015; Munjal et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2017 Singh et al. , 2019 . The direct and indirect costs due to the FMD outbreak in the UK in 2001 were assessed to be over US$9 billion. Over 150 million chicken died or were destroyed in Southeast Asia in 2004 to control HPAI (H5N1). The Netherlands suffered an economic loss of $2.5 billion due to classical swine fever in [1997] [1998] . As per the estimates of FAO nearly one-third of the world meat trade was facing import bans on account of BSE, HPAI and other animal diseases. There is evidence to suggest that threats from TADs have increased over the years. The risk of animal disease outbreaks is likely to further grow in future as the higher incomes of people in developing countries will generate more demand for animal protein and products (milk, meat, egg, chicken and fish). The number of animals raised for meat is growing rapidly. During 1990s poultry production in East Asia has increased by about 12% per year to double every 5-6 years. Similar to TADs, new human viral diseases have emerged like Ebola, SARS, Zika, CCHF, Nipah and BSE as well as there is the emergence of new antigenic forms or new biotypes of the existing infectious diseases, such as a hypervirulent strain of IBD in poultry in Europe and highly virulent strain of Newcastle disease in the USA (Riemenschneider 2005; Singh et al. 2017) . Vector-borne pathogens, namely, bluetongue, African horse sickness, Rift Valley fever and West Nile fever, have the potential to spread in epidemic forms. Riemenschneider (2005) has deliberated over several issues relevant in the control of TADs as proposed in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report (Anonymous 2003) . Some of the points which could be responsible for the increased threat of TADs are briefly discussed below.",

Breach in biosecurity due to ignorance and avoidable lapses in the adoption of timely biosecurity and biosafety measures in the management of livestock, poultry and fish minimise the risks from infectious diseases including EIDs and TADs. Breach in biosecurity in livestock management is often an important reason for the high incidence of zoonotic and other infectious diseases of animals. This is more so in case of the viral diseases of livestock and poultry. Closer contact between wildlife, animals and humans and rearing of livestock and poultry in close association with people promote spread of viral and other infectious diseases which have the potential for threatening health, economies and food security around the world. The emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example of zoonotic disease threats adversely affecting both animal health and public health, national economies and food and nutrition security globally.

Biosafety aims at the protection of person(s) at work and the facilities which are dealing with the biological agents, against their exposure to a disease agent, and prevents unintentional exposure to pathogens/toxins or their accidental release. Thus, biosafety is the application of knowledge, techniques and equipment to prevent personal, laboratory and environmental exposure to potentially infectious agents or biohazards. Biosecurity, unlike biosafety, has divergent meanings in different contexts in which it is used. It deals with the protection of microbiological assets from spill-over, theft, loss, diversion or intentional release from laboratories, preventing the import of certain organisms/ toxins. Biosecurity is a set of preventive measures designed to reduce the risk of intentional transmission of infectious diseases to safeguard the facilities containing sensitive biological materials with the potential of a biological weapon. In brief, biosecurity means bio-risk management. Once a disease is eradicated globally, the policy for keeping the wild and vaccine strains of the virus along with vaccine stocks for emergency use and their subsequent destruction is decided by international agencies like FAO, WHO and OIE based on the recommendations of experts in the area.",

Since all these countries are vulnerable to TADs, there is a need for regional biosecurity plan to ensure a biosecure region. It would never be possible to have a biosecure country if the bordering countries do not have effective biosecurity in place.

It has been observed that lack or inadequate compensation for culling the diseased and in-contact animals and poultry and negative effect on the sale, sale price and exports deter the farmers from reporting animal diseases in time which eventually leads to the spread of TADs. For example, due to BSE cattle producers in the USA lost over $1 billion in exports to Japan. Similarly, HPAI resulted in over $1 billion loss in poultry exports for Thailand. Trade concerns also discourage the use of preventive vaccinations for some diseases such as HPAI and FMD. Disease-free countries are generally reluctant to import animals or animal products from the countries practicing preventive vaccinations. With these adverse trade considerations, stamping-out policy was adopted by the UK over the vaccination for FMD in 2001 outbreak. From a public health point of view, a vaccination programme might reduce the viral load circulating in a country and thus reduce the risk of HPAI spreading to humans. However, stamping out rather than vaccination is preferred by most of the countries to declare themselves free from disease/infection at the earliest possible to regain access to exports. To ensure the cooperation of livestock farmers, it is essential to provide adequate and timely compensations to reduce the losses suffered by them on account of culling and closing the units for a few months.",

The major objectives and motive of veterinary vaccines are to protect, improve and promote the health and welfare of companion and food animals; increase the production of livestock in a cost-effective manner; and prevent animal-to-human transmission of infectious diseases from domestic animals and wildlife to humans through animal-origin food, close contact and other mechanisms.

The virus affected wild birds as well as domestic poultry. Sporadic cases of transmission to humans in close contact of infected birds with sizeable mortality raised the pandemic concern of 'bird flu'. After the first report of the H5N1 virus from India and Bangladesh in 2006 and 2007, respectively, both these countries are experiencing outbreaks almost every year. Between February-March 2006 and February 2019, India incurred an expenditure of more than INR 1098.7 million, including INR 263.7 million for compensation and INR 835 million on the culling of 8.349 million birds (Anonymous 2018-19) . Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become a continued threat to global health and economy. After its first outbreak in 2014, the H5N8 HPAI serotype disseminated very fast from Korea to other parts of Asia, Europe and North America, a feature not observed in case of other highly pathogenic AIVs. However, the pathobiological features of the virus that favoured its global translocation are not known. Results of simulation studies undertaken in migratory birds to identify pathobiological features supporting AIV intercontinental dissemination risk suggest that characteristic differences exist among H5N8 and other AIV subtypes, e.g. H5N6 and H5N1 that have not spread as rapidly. Lower infection recovery and mortality rates and migration recovery rates also favour translocation in migratory bird populations. Although India has been reporting H5N1 AIV since 2006, the H5N8 virus was first time reported in 2017 from migratory birds and poultry in the states of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana. Studies undertaken on comparative epidemiology of influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9 among human and bird populations to find out similarities and differences between the two viruses in their genetic characteristics, distribution patterns in human and bird populations and postulated mechanisms of global spread (Bui et al. 2014) indicated that H7N9 viruses are diversifying at a much greater rate than H5N1 viruses. Analyses of certain H7N9 strains demonstrated similarities with engineered transmissible H5N1 viruses, which make it more adaptable to the human respiratory tract. These differences in the epidemiology of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in human and birds raise further questions as to how H7N9 has spread at a greater rate than the H5N1 virus.",

Although first described in 1921 and it affected more than 50 countries in Africa, Europe and South America, several key issues about its pathogenesis, immune evasion and epidemiology remain uncertain (Arias et al. 2017 ). In the absence of a vaccine, the disease causes greater sanitary, social and economic impacts on swine herds compared to many other swine diseases. Currently, ASF is present in sub-Saharan Africa, Sardinia, the Trans-Caucasus, the Russian Federation and Central and Eastern states of the European Union. The disease continues to spread, with first reports in China (August 2018), Bulgaria (August 2018), Belgium (September 2018) and Vietnam (February 2019) highlighting the increasing threat of ASF to the global pig industry (Netherton et al. 2019) . Ongoing outbreaks have also been reported in Hungary, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Cambodia, North Korea, Vietnam and Laos. The disease was rampant in China during 2019, and about half of China's breeding pigs died or were slaughtered. The threat of ASF looms large as presently no licensed vaccine is available against this disease, and further research is desired in this area for the development of live attenuated vaccines for ASFV. It has been possible to generate pigs resistant to classical swine fever virus and PRRS virus (Burkard et al. 2018 ) by using genetic modification of the host species. Genetic modification can be attempted as a viable solution to increase the host resistance to ASFV. Wild suids, namely warthog or bush pig, sequences could be engineered into the domestic pig genome to produce animals in which replication of ASF virus and/or disease burden after ASFV infection is reduced. However, to generate pigs fully resistant to ASFV infection, a more effective strategy such as targeting the virus receptors on the host cell to block the entry of virus and viral replication may be attempted.",

Such studies will provide a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of ASF. The specific role of different hosts including wild suids, vectors and environmental factors in disease propagation needs to be elucidated for understanding different epidemiological scenarios. In this regard, the northern European scenario in which infected wild boars drive disease transmission and maintenance needs to be investigated further.

Knight-Jones et al. (2016) have given a detailed account of global FMD research update along with gaps and an overview of global status and research needs. The conclusions are drawn to highlight that currently available vaccines and control tools have enabled FMD eradication from many countries of the developed world. However, in many developing countries, FMD remains uncontrolled. The main reason given is that biosecurity measures that have been fundamental to successful FMD control in the developed country are difficult to be implemented effectively in developing countries due to obvious reasons. In the present scenario, improved vaccines, with longer lasting protection against a wider range of FMDV strains and lower production costs, could be the single most important development to enhance our ability to control FMD. Although encouraging progress has been made with several novel vaccine candidates, addressing key limitations of the current inactivated vaccines, a commercial vaccine is yet awaited. While new discoveries are crucial, current vaccines have been used to effectively control FMD on numerous occasions. However, for imparting better immunity, FMD vaccines should be subjected to adequate quality assurance and be made available in sufficient quantity to provide desired coverage following appropriate strategy. There is also a need for better training and support in the design and execution of vaccine-based FMD control programmes. Another area of research is genetic and molecular studies on the virus to elucidate host-virus interactions. More powerful tools and analyses are increasing our understanding of various aspects of FMDV evolution, ecology and epidemiology. This, in turn, should benefit many areas of FMD research, from basic virology to the vaccine and diagnostic development. Furthermore, improved genetic technologies have the potential to reveal information crucial for control, such as transmission chains, vaccine match and level of virus circulation.",

However, if improved and more widespread FMD control is to be achieved, continued investment in FMD research at the local and international level is a must. Improved DIVA diagnostics increase our ability to detect infected animals in vaccinated populations. Greater confidence in the ascertainment of FMD status of animals and products has, in turn, opened the way for international standards for trade and disease control that are more efficient and less restrictive. Rigorous licensing procedures increase the time taken for new technologies for diagnostic kits and vaccines to reach the market. However, if authorisation is less rigorous, substandard products may be released onto the market. Hence, there is a need to balance these two requirements.

Throughout the history of humankind, the social, economic and ecological consequences due to rinderpest had been more catastrophic, even changing the history of nations and empires. In India, the presence of rinderpest was confirmed by the Cattle Plague Commission (Hallen et al. 1871) . This disease has been conquered successfully by following mass vaccination along with zoo sanitary measures. The FAO declared the global eradication of rinderpest on 28 June 2011, marking it the first ever viral disease of animals eradicated globally about three decades after the eradication of smallpox, a viral disease of humans in 1980 (Yadav et al. 2016) . Constraints of availability of quality vaccine in sufficient quality, freeze-drying of vaccines and maintenance of cold chain for a vaccine in tropical countries, lack of infrastructure for structured clinical surveillance and sero-surveillance were some of the limitations in executing the mass vaccination programmes. In India, dividing the country into four zones based on the epidemiological picture of the disease and adopting strategic and focused vaccinations at interstate and international borders and migration routes of bovines and caprine for creating immune belts, coupled with rigorous clinical and sero-surveillance, were of great help in achieving freedom from the infection. The financial support and/or technical guidance from FAO, OIE, EU and IAEA were the driving forces in achieving infection-free status for India in the year 2006. With the successful eradication of rinderpest, the livestock sector across the globe became safer, and consequently the living standard of livestock farmers improved.",

A holistic vision and approaches are required for timely implementation of these concepts and strategies along with the strengthening of various multidimensional research and development programmes supported by appropriate funding resources. These measures will greatly help to minimise disease incidences and outbreaks, and lessen economic burdens due to infectious animal diseases and boost livestock and poultry health, reproduction and production to strengthen sustainable growth of livestock and poultry industry. Reduction in pandemic threats and public health concerns eventually lead to an improvement in the socioeconomic status and welfare of the society at large under 'One Health' umbrella. Application of artificial intelligence (AI), GPS, remote sensing and traceability in disease detection and management needs priority attention in developing countries. Similarly, the latest techniques of gene editing, base editing, nanotechnologies, electronic nose, etc. should be applied for efficient disease diagnosis and drug delivery. While planning the breeding policies for livestock and poultry, both higher production performance and health of the progeny should be given equal weightage. Modern techniques should be used for developing disease resistance (absolute or partial) in livestock and poultry using indigenous germplasm.",

An outbreak of FMD in the UK in 2001, bluetongue in 2007, equine influenza in Australia in 2007 and India in 2008-2009, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Maharashtra and adjoining parts of India in 2006 caused severe damage and economic losses to the farmers and industry.",
