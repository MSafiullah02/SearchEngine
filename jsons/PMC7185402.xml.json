The start of a symptomatic exacerbation episode was the first day of 2 or more new symptoms lasting for 2 or more consecutive days. The end of the episode was the last consecutive day with 2 or more symptoms (allowing symptoms to change over time).

Further research is required to investigate how the pathogens identified here influence the balance of other organisms in the respiratory tract and thereby the response to antibiotic therapy.
