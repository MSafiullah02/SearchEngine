Recently, this was confirmed in a large prospective trial of COPD, but importantly, the other factor that was found to be independently associated with exacerbation risk was the occurrence of exacerbations themselves.5 In the context of acute infection, our results emphasize that there is an important interaction between acute infection and severity of airflow obstruction. In addition, we have decided to divide subjects into those with wholly reversible airways disease (asthma) and those with incomplete reversibility, COPD. We acknowledge that such a description may be a departure from traditional diagnostic paradigms for airway disease that focus on a mixture of history, exposure and airway physiology. We have remained essentially true to this in terms of asthma, with subjects when stable needing to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction; but within this group, we chose not to exclude smokers. Nonetheless, the group we have defined as asthma were younger, were less likely to have smoked and had smoked less compared with those classified COPD. In contrast, those with COPD did not necessarily have a history of smoking, emphasizing that smoking\u2010induced fixed obstructive airway disease does not have to be solely synonymous with COPD. In this way, we feel we have been able to examine the effects of fixed airway disease, for which COPD stands, and found that independent of smoking status, fixed airway disease is an important predictor in multivariate analysis for both LOS and readmission.",

This level of vaccination is probably inadequate,20 and of the patients, 4/6 with influenza have not been vaccinated and one had received the vaccine within 3 weeks of admission. In both years, there was a peak of non\u2010severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in spring. RV was the most prevalent virus through all seasons, with the exception of spring.

The recent discovery of a new species of RV\u2010C21 has led to renewed interest as to whether specific RV species may be associated with more severe clinical disease. In young children with acute asthma, there does appear to be such an association with one large US study demonstrating RV\u2010C followed by RV\u2010A was associated with severe exacerbations.22 This was particularly marked in a Western Australia study, where the majority of children with acute asthma had RV\u2010C and it again was associated with more severe disease.17 Our findings in adults do not support the assertion that the majority of exacerbations are due to RV\u2010C, with RV\u2010A clearly playing a prominent role. The differences with our findings could be explained in several ways. RV\u2010C may particularly affect children, with a possible tropism for asthma and atopic disease.17 Any variation in RV\u2010induced exacerbations may also reflect the strains circulating in the community, as we did not include non\u2010asthmatic/COPD adults or children, this remains unclear. Alternatively, RV\u2010C may be more difficult to identify in adults, who usually present later with exacerbations compared with children, and shed less virus for shorter periods of time. Nonetheless, RV\u2010A strains are known experimentally to cause a significant increase in symptoms in adults with asthma23 and COPD,24 and our results confirm them to be important pathogens associated with exacerbations.",

How this occurs and how co\u2010infection worsens underlying chronic airway disease warrant further investigation. As yet, no specific interventions have looked at minimizing the effect of RV virus infection in adults with asthma and COPD, although these exist.29 Macrolide antibiotics are also an interesting potential therapeutic, they reduce exacerbation risk in COPD30 and may reduce the impact of RV infection at least in vitro.31 However, it is also worthy to consider that uncomplicated and inexpensive infection control procedures such as hand\u2010washing and wearing surgical masks are potentially very effective at limiting virus transmission and can be employed by patients and their families at home.32\n",
