Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most widespread technique for pathogen identification [4]; however, simultaneous detection of different pathogens by multiplex PCR demands reaction standardization. To this end, nCounter (NanoString Technologies), a digital mRNA expression profiling method, can overcome these drawbacks: it identifies genetic material using two probes, one anchored to the genetic material and the other anchored to a singular bar code that identifies the target by specific hybridization. Upon bar code hybridization, presence and frequency of the target is revealed and multiple barcodes in the same reaction allow multiplex analysis [5].",

Preprocessing sequentially corrects for three factors: technical variation, background and sample content. First, using a set of exogenous positive control RNAs present in each sample (see also Fig. 1\n), technical variation is accounted for by adjusting the counts in each sample to the geometric mean of counts for positive control counts in all samples. Subsequently, a background correction is performed by subtracting the maximum count value of the negative control probes in a sample from each probe output within the sample. Transcripts counts that are negative after background correction are set to 1. Each sample is then normalized for RNA content by adjusting the counts to the geometric mean of 15 housekeeping genes (Supplementary Table 2). Finally, the data were log 2 transformed. Full details of each step can be found in the supplementary information of Waggott et al. [8]. Network data were designed by association matrix and the graph file was created using Gephi. Nodes were aligned by Force Atlas algorithm and the centrality was calculated by the betweenness. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism version 5.0.",

            "text": "The digital nCounter profiling technology captures and counts specific nucleic acid molecules in a complex mixture [5]. Briefly, unique pairs of capture and detection probes are designed against each gene of interest. The capture probe consists of a sequence complimentary to a target pathogen mRNA and a short common sequence coupled to an affinity tag (biotin). The reporter probe also contains the complementary sequence but is coupled to a color-coded tag, providing the detection signal. The color code in each tag is unique, allowing the accurate discrimination of the different targets, in a complex mixture. Capture and reporter probes are mixed with total RNA in a single hybridization reaction, resulting in the formation of tripartite structures (target bound to the specific reporter and capture probes). Unhybridized probes are washed away and remaining complexes are exposed to streptavidin. Targets bound to the specific probes are immobilized on a solid surface that is scanned; the unique reporter probe then identifies each target and the level of expression is measured by the digital readout of transcript counts. The reaction occurs in the absence of nucleic acid amplification and/or enzymatic reactions. To estimate target concentration, nCounter uses a series of positive controls covering a range of known concentrations (0.1\u2013100 fM, comparable to 0.2\u2013200 copies per cell). Based on the counts obtained for these known concentrations, the concentration of mRNA transcripts can be estimated. This estimate is done by plotting the counts obtained for the positive controls versus the concentrations tested and by fitting a regression line through the average (Fig. 1). The regression line allows the quantification of mRNA transcript concentration. The correlation between the counts for positive controls and the concentration was 0.99 and 0.98 for the lower concentration range.",

Detection was also positive in NPA spiked with known viral RNA (6.25\u201312.5\u201325 ng), indicating absence of inhibitors in RNA isolated from NPA (Fig. 2B). In addition, use of tRNA (an RNA carrier) to ARI samples did not improve viral detection (Supplementary Fig. 1), confirming that even NPA containing low input RNA (<10 ng) is suitable. Bacterial RNA (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae) was also detected in both patient\u015b and control NPA (Fig. 2C).",

Using this extended group, we detected RV (2% of samples), BoV (3%), CoV (229E and OC43, 3%), IV A (3%), hMPV (5%), PIV (genotypes 1 and 3, 21%) and RSV A and B (21%). In addition, detection of DNA virus AV (types 2 and 5) was confirmed at the RNA level in 10% of samples, indicating ongoing (intracellular) viral replication. Transcripts for C. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae were detected in 2, 3, 8 and 26% of samples, respectively. H. influenzae and S. aureus transcripts were ubiquitous (69 and 77% of samples, respectively) and were also detected in healthy controls (28 and 100% of samples, respectively). Using this data set, we observed bacterial presence in the majority of children (55.1%), whereas in 43.5% of children, both viruses and bacteria were present (Fig. 4\nA). A low percentage of children (1.5%) presented viruses only. Upon observation of the number of transcripts per type of pathogen (Fig. 4B), AV 2 and RSB (A and B) showed the highest mean transcript numbers (>10.000), comparing the 61 samples. The mean number of transcripts detected for AV 5, BoV and PIV 3 was <10.000. CoV (229E and OC43), IV (A and B), hMPV, PIV 1 and RV presented the lowest mean number of transcripts (\u22641000). For bacteria, the mean transcript number of C. pneumoniae, across the 61 NPA samples, was comparable to that detected for AV and RSV (\u223c10.000). For the other bacterial targets (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae), the mean number of transcripts was \u22641000.",

To our knowledge, this is the first description of detection of a pathogenic DNA virus (Adenovirus type 2 and 5) at the RNA level in clinical samples. In contrast to a standard DNA PCR, which quantifies DNA in (mostly extracellular) viral particles, nCounter enables demonstration of ongoing (intracellular) viral replication, which we hypothesize to be more relevant to ARI pathogenesis. We also, simultaneously detected transcripts for C. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, which are commonly isolated from the respiratory tract [12], as is H. influenzae. We observed a good agreement between Real-Time PCR and nCounter for RSV (A and B) detection, reinforcing the possibility of using the latter as an alternative method for pathogen detection. Of note, RSVA strains present a high variability in the target used for detection (G protein domain) [13], also in Brazil [6], which could explain the weaker correlation observed for nCounter and Real-Time PCR, as compared to RSVB.",

There is evidence that viral respiratory infections can stimulate an increase in bacterial load and this association can lead to secondary complications [14]. Preterm infants with RSV and bacterial co-infection were hospitalized for longer periods and more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit, compared to children infected with RSV alone [15]. In our samples, the majority of ARI patients presented H. influenzae and S. aureus, which, together with S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis are the usual opportunistic pathogens co-detected with RSV [16], [17], [18]. Indeed, transcripts for all these agents were detected in our NPA samples from children with ARI. Network analysis showed strong links between PIV 1 and H. influenzae and between RSV B and S. pneumoniae, for example. Both S. pneumoniae\n[19] and RSV activate the inflammasome [20]; S. pneumoniae triggers NF-kB activation leading to an inflammatory response whereas, RSV infection results in a strong interferon response. The possible overlap between the signaling pathways triggered by each pathogen may synergize and amplify the inflammatory signal during co-infection. This exacerbated immune response could accentuate damage in situ and increase morbidity. Given this scenario, knowing the effective pathogen load, as shown here by nCounter, can contribute towards understanding the contribution of each pathogen to disease severity. As a proof-of-principle, our group has already used nCounter to simultaneously quantify both human and retroviral transcriptomes; thus, revealing intact IFN signaling in HTLV-1 infection [21].",

Moreover, a transcriptomic approach involving pathogen detection, and as discussed above, immune response transcripts will enable the identification of biomarkers in ARI clinical samples, even those presenting low RNA yield (10\u201350 ng) such as NPA. This approach, combined with long-term clinical follow-up, will increase our understanding of ARI pathogenesis, disease progression (wheezing, asthma) and, more importantly, provide an evidence-based approach for the targeted and rational use of antibiotics in pediatric ARI.",
