Bats may also be at risk of direct persecution or they may die accidently if trapped within buildings. In general, eviction of bats from buildings should follow the general rule of avoidance-mitigation-compensation. When considering conservation measures for synanthropic bats, it is most important to assess the role of the building for different life stages of bats. Construction work at buildings should be conducted in a manner that minimizes disturbance of bats. Artificial roosts can replace lost roosts, yet bats will often not accept alternative roosts. Demographic changes in human populations may lead to the abandonment of buildings, for example, in rural areas and to increased conflicts in urban areas when old buildings are replaced by new buildings or when previously unoccupied space in buildings is renovated.

Bats have low reproductive rates that are associated with exceptionally long life spans, a feature most obvious in insectivorous bats from temperate zones (Wilkinson and South 2002; Munshi-South and Wilkinson 2010) . Long life spans may predispose bats to inhabit relatively permanent structures, such as in buildings, since some bat species are loyal to their roost over many years and form long-term social relationships with other colony members (Kerth et al. 2011 ). Similar to other small mammals, bats exhibit relatively high mass-specific metabolic rates (McNab 2002) . Many bats are also heterothermic, reducing their body temperature and consequently metabolic rate, during periods of adverse conditions, such as low resource abundance (insects, fruits, or nectar), low ambient temperature, or high rainfall (Geiser 2004) . Most notably, temperate zone bats employ extended torpor when they hibernate in winter. Apart from hibernation, almost all bats use torpor on a daily basis as an energy-saving strategy (Speakman and Thomas 2003; Willis et al. 2006) . During daytime torpor, bats may use passive rewarming when ambient temperatures peak during the warmest part of the day (Turbill et al. 2003) . The use of radiant heat created by the exposure of building exteriors to sunshine likely saves synanthropic bats significant amounts of energy since they do not depend on endogenous heat production in brown adipose tissue (Geiser and Drury 2003) .

(2013) reported that in Norway, hibernating bats prefer anthropogenic structures rather than natural subground hibernacula, but the reason for this preference was unknown. Bats, such as big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, hibernating in walls of heated buildings expose themselves to ambient temperatures of 2-5 \u00b0C which are created by the balance between warm interior temperatures from heated rooms and cold ambient temperatures from the outside (Whitaker and Gummer 1992) . In addition, bats hibernating in buildings may also benefit from occasional passive rewarming, when being exposed to mild exterior temperatures. Nyctalus noctula usually forms maternity colonies in tree roosts, yet in Central and northern Europe, they frequently use prefabricated buildings, i.e., multistory buildings consisting of prefabricated concrete walls that are assembled at the construction site.

Roosts in buildings could reduce the exposure of bats to predators if predators avoid anthropogenic environments.

For example, elevated ambient temperatures in attics seem to be ideal for pregnant and lactating bats. Angolan free-tailed bats, Mops condylurus, inhabit maternity roosts under corrugated steel roofs of houses that often exceed 40 \u00b0C during the day , enabling them to maintain ideal growth conditions throughout the reproductive period without expending a lot of energy (Vivier and van der Merwe 2007) . Their use of hot roosts may even be linked to increased reproductive rates . Higher roost temperatures in attics seem to be also favorable for the development of juveniles of European greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis. This species forms large clusters of individuals in natural cave roosts, presumably to benefit from huddling and sharing of body heat (Dietz et al. 2009 ). In buildings, however, greater mouse-eared bats usually form smaller colonies, and these smaller clusters may be energetically feasible only because Myotis myotis may benefit from exogenous instead of endogenous heat when roosting in warm attics (Zahn 1999) . The use of different locations depending on reproductive state has been confirmed for other species as well, including Rafinesque's big-eared bats, Corynorhinus rafinesquii (Roby et al. 2011 ). Similar to attic-roosting Myotis myotis, thermal benefits have also been suggested for Eptesicus fuscus. Pregnant big brown bats rarely entered torpor when roosting at favorable ambient conditions in buildings (Lausen and Barclay 2006) . The avoidance of torpor may be advantageous for fetal development. For example, big brown bats gave birth earlier when roosting in buildings than when roosting in natural roosts. Furthermore, juveniles from buildings fledged one to two weeks earlier than conspecifics born in natural roosts (Lausen and Barclay 2006) . Similarly, building-dwelling bats gave birth earlier than their conspecifics roosting in foliage or trees (Kurta 2010) .

These secondary social benefits for synanthropic bats are identical to those of conspecific roosting in natural roosts. Briefly, bats that form large colonies in buildings may be less exposed to predators because of the dilution effect. They may as well benefit from information transfer and by cooperation among members of the same social unit. Clustered emergence of bats from a roost may constitute an antipredator behavior (Speakman et al. 1995 ), yet clustered emergence may be disrupted in large colonies due to bottleneck effects (Speakman et al. 1999 ). Gillam et al. (2011) found non-random patterns when pit-tagged Eptesicus fuscus emerged from buildings, indicating that these bats may form social bonds that likely influence their foraging. Information transfer might also be involved during swarming at buildings as observed in some temperate zone bats (Kanuch et al. 2010; \u0160uba et al. 2010 ).

Therefore, it is almost impossible for aerial-hawking insectivorous bats to use these habitats, unless artificial roosting structures are available. Here, buildings may present pivotal resources for bats to survive in an otherwise hostile environment. Farm buildings, villages, and cities may create structurally complex islands used by bat colonies (Coleman and Barclay 2012a) , and this could possibly lead to an increase in local species richness.

Chemical pollutants are likely an indirect threat for bats roosting in buildings (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Bayat et al. 2014) . Wood used in buildings is usually treated by chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons to prevent rotting caused by fungi or insects. Bats roosting in buildings are in close contact with wooden structures and thus may be exposed to chemical preservatives such as lindane, pentachlorophenol, and pyrethroids (Racey and Swift 1986; Boyd and Myhill 1988; Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Shore et al. 1990 Shore et al. , 1991 Bennet and Thies 2007) . Most often, bats do not die immediately after contact with treated wood but instead suffer sublethal effects that cause, for example, immune suppression (Corrao et al. 1985; Clark and Shore 2001) . Sometimes, bats are eradicated from buildings using poisons, and these poisons continue to persist so that bats may be exposed to toxic residues for extended periods after application. Poisoning is usually a gradual process that is exacerbated in temperate bats via the accumulation of toxic compounds in fat tissue and seasonal mobilization of these compounds during migration and hibernation (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Bayat et al. 2014) . Since the introduction of alternative bat-friendly chemical treatments of wood in buildings, mortality caused by chlorinated hydrocarbons has decreased markedly (Bayat et al. 2014 ), yet from a global perspective, the problem of slow poisoning of synanthropic bats in buildings remains an issue. Parasites Patterson et al. (2007) found that bats inhabiting relatively permanent roosts, such as caves and buildings, carry more ectoparasites than bats that roost in temporal structures, such as leaves or tree hollows. Buildings may provide ectoparasites, e.g., streblid flies, bed bugs (Cimex spp.), or reduviid bugs (Triatominae; Reduviidae), an ideal substrate for egg laying and larval development. As female bats may be immunosuppressed during pregnancy, they may suffer from heavy parasite infestation during reproduction (Christe et al. 2000; Pearce and O'Shea 2007) . The combined effect of inflammation and immune challenge may then increase oxidative stress and consequently reduce longevity in housedwelling bats (Schneeberger et al. 2013; Lilley et al. 2014) . Endoparasites are poorly studied in synanthropic bats. Leishmania braziliensis occurs in Brazilian house-dwelling bats, yet it is unknown whether roost choice and colony dynamics are different from those of conspecifics roosting in natural roosts and whether building roosts may impose a higher risk of contracting these parasites (Shapiro et al. 2013 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 277, "text": "(Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 278, "end": 296, "text": "Bayat et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 607, "end": 629, "text": "(Racey and Swift 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 630, "end": 651, "text": "Boyd and Myhill 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 652, "end": 679, "text": "Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 680, "end": 697, "text": "Shore et al. 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 698, "end": 717, "text": "Shore et al. , 1991", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 718, "end": 740, "text": "Bennet and Thies 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 896, "end": 916, "text": "(Corrao et al. 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 917, "end": 938, "text": "Clark and Shore 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1363, "text": "(Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1382, "text": "Bayat et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1564, "text": "(Bayat et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1714, "text": "Patterson et al.

For example, synanthropic bats, such as molossids, feed on large quantities of insects that are vectors of human diseases, such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya fever (Andrianaivoarivelo et al. 2006; Goodman et al. 2008b) . In tropical and subtropical regions, bats are important seed and pollen dispersers. Orchards in house gardens may largely benefit from the cost-free ecosystem services provided by pollinating bats.

Other synanthropic bat species may carry lyssaviruses, such as the molossid bats Tadarida brasiliensis or Nyctinomops macrotis in North and South America, or vespertilionid bats such as Eptesicus furinalis in South America (Clark et al. 1996; Uieda 1998; Passos et al. 1998; de Almeida et al. 2011; Favi et al. 2012) or nycterid bats such as Nycteris thebaica in Zimbabwe (Foggin 1988) . In Kenya, SARSlike coronaviruses (CoVs) were identified in a Chaerephon spp. (Tong et al. 2009 ), and in South Africa, bat-derived CoVs that are closely related to the MERS-CoV were found in Neoromicia capensis (Corman et al. 2014 ). Frequent roost switching of synanthropic bats may increase the transmission risk of the rabies virus to humans (Ellison et al. 2007 ), particularly when humans try to evict bats from houses (Streicker et al. 2013) . In general, precautionary measures should be taken when handling synanthropic bats: (1) Do not touch or handle bats without gloved hands, and (2) in case of a bat bite, immediately proceed to the appropriate facility for post-exposure prophylactics. A more detailed treatment of bat-related diseases is provided in Chap. 10 (Schneeberger and Voigt 2016). Bacteria Bacterial infections are one of the primary causes of natural death in temperate bats (M\u00fchldorfer et al. 2012) , and many of the documented bacterial strains are relevant to human health. For example, bats may act as a reservoir for Bartonella/Burkholderia bacteria, which can be transmitted to humans via bed bugs (Saenz et al. 2013) . Bat ticks, specifically Argas vespertilionis, collected from a human-inhabited building were documented to carry Borrelia, Rickettisa, and Ehrlichia species (Socolovschi et al. 2012) . Staphylococcus nepalensis was detected in guano samples from mixed M. myotis and M. blythii summer roosts, and guano in or near buildings may pose a significant threat to human health (Vandzurova et al. 2013 ). To our knowledge, no direct infection of humans with bat-related bacterial strains has been described.

However, it should be noted that many bat species roosting in attics or barns prefer large and complex structures with some variation in microclimate conditions. A decrease in size and structural complexity of the roost space may lead to the gradual decline in colony size and possibly complete loss. Therefore, a reduction in roost size may best be accompanied by the provision of new artificial roosts that are suitable for the specific bat species (Figs. 14.4 and 14.5; Kunz and Reynolds 2003) .

The addition of artificial bat boxes near previously occupied buildings can successfully compensate in some instances. For example, colonies of Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Plecotus auritus and various other species throughout Europe benefited from artificial roosts when the original roost was destroyed (Anonymous 2006; Beck and Schelbert 1999) . Artificial bat roosts were also provided for and accepted by South American Molossus molossus when roosts in buildings were destroyed (Alberico et al. 2004) . In North America, Eptesicus fuscus, and Myotis lucifugus, will occupy artificial bat boxes installed at buildings that formerly housed colonies (Brittingham and Williams 2000) . For example, the Bat House Research Project in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, has recently provided new accommodation for bats in the Letaba Rest Camp in an effort to help identify the most effective way to remove bats from buildings within the park (http://www.krugerpark. co.za/krugerpark-times-2-11-bat-accommodation-19864.html). Similar attempts to provide alternative roosting structures for synanthropic bats have been successful in the USA; for example, artificial roosts have been built on the campus of the University of Florida to host populations of Tadarida brasiliensis and other native bats (https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/index.php/bats/home/). These success stories should not imply that roosts in building are replaceable by artificial structures and that bats will readily occupy artificial roosts. Sometimes, for unknown reasons, bats avoid artificial roosts in buildings completely. Therefore, protection of existing roosts should be considered prior to attempting the use of artificial roosts. .

Protection of the last maternity colony of greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, in Germany According to surveys over the past decades, populations of greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, are on the decline throughout Europe (Ransome and Hutson 2000; Dietz et al. 2009; Spitzenberger et al. 2010) . Although some parts of southern Germany were inhabited previously by this species, today they are virtually absent from Germany except for a maternity colony found in 1992 in Hohenburg, a small village located in northeastern Bavaria adjacent to a large military training area.

The majority of space inside the building complex was designated for the exclusive use by bats. The ground floor level of the main buildings was transformed into an education center and some office space for the project coordinator. The fact that several attics and rooms with variable microclimatic conditions were available to the colony likely contributed to the success of the project. This is consistent with observations of roost use by greater horseshoe bats elsewhere. For example, Maltagliati et al. (2013) pointed out that the largest nursery colony of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in Italy uses several buildings. The Hohenburg house was carefully modified to include some further beneficial structures for bats. For example, workers built a so-called heat dome inside the attic where warm, upward moving air is trapped in a structure that is used by bats as a roosting site (Fig. 14.6b, c) .

Bats most often use the attic of the largest backyard building (b).
