Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses.

As of 27th January 2020, the death toll from the coronavirus stood at 80, with more than 2500 confirmed cases in China, as well as in 11 other countries. 1 The virus, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, causes a contagious, respiratory infection. The incubation period is reportedly 2 to 10 days, and studies are underway to determine whether the transmission is possible from asymptomatic individuals. 1 Similar to other coronaviruses, 2019-nCoV reportedly possesses a surface glycoprotein. In more established coronavirus pathogenesis, this protein has been shown to bind host cellular receptors and to mediate membrane fusion. 2 More importantly, it has been described as a potential vaccine target in both SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 3, 4 This study aimed to identify significant cytotoxic T cell (CTL) and B cell epitopes within the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein using bioinformatic analysis. We also studied the potential interaction of the putative CTL epitopes with their corresponding representative major histocompatibility complex (MCH) class I supertypes most frequently observed in the Chinese population. We investigated hydrogen bonding, salt-bridges, and residue-residue contacts between CTL binding epitopes and the MHC class I molecules by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. NetCTL uses NetMHC server's artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict MHC binding, NetChop-3.0 to predict C-terminal cleavages and a weight matrix to calculate TAP transport efficiency to generate predictions. The scores of the three prediction methods are merged into a single score, which can be translated as sensitivity and specificity for the epitope-MHC-I binding event. We predicted MHC-peptidebinding for the following MHC class I supertypes-A2, A3, B7, B44, and B62. Together, these supertypes account for the majority of human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A) (76.5%) and HLA-B (67.1%) distribution in the Chinese population. 7 Epitopes with a combined score of >0.75 (sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.97) were further confirmed in CTLPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ctlpred), 8 where a consensus scoring approach was taken with thresholds of 0.51 (ANN) and 0.36 (support vector machines).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 387, "end": 388, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 641, "end": 642, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 868, "end": 869, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1038, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1040, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2229, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2386, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The three highest-scoring epitopes for each supertype were selected for analyses of binding affinity to their corresponding representative supertypes in NetMHCpan 4.0 server which predicted epitope-MHC-I binding using ANN trained on quantitative binding data and mass spectroscopy-derived MHC eluted ligands (http:// www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan). 9 Default threshold % ranks of 0.5 for strong binders, and 2 for weak binders were used.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 353, "end": 354, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| METHODS"}, {"text": "Binding CTL epitopes were selected for homology modeling in PEP-FOLD3, and structures with the lowest coarse-grained energy were selected for protein-protein docking with corresponding HLA F I G U R E 1 Interactions between cytotoxic T lymphocyte binding epitopes and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) chains of corresponding major histocompatibility complex class I supertype representative during molecular dynamics simulations.

In this study, we attempted to identify significant CTL and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV.CTLs can become activated after they detect infected cellspresenting the offending viral antigens as part of surface antigen-MHC-I complexes. Successful presentation depends on the effective harboring of antigens by MHC-I molecules via hydrogen bonds and salt bridge interactions that allow both high affinity with broader specificity. 21 After docking and structure refinement, we analyzed interactions between individual CTL epitopes and HLA chains of their corresponding MHC class I supertype representative by MDs simulations. We observed multiple, maintained hydrogen bond interactions, in addition to the presence of salt-bridges in three complexes. Collectively, these interactions indicate a potentially successful presentation of the epitopes by MHC class I molecules, thereby activating CTLs and generating immune responses. We compared the epitopes obtained in our study with epitopes predicted in the spike protein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 22,23 We found one overlapping CTL epitope between MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV with one gap and one mismatch (YLQPRTFLL/YKLQPLTFLL), and no comparable epitopes with SARS-CoV.
