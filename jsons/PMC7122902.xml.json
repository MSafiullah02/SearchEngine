Plasmacytoid (lymphoid) dendritic cells and myeloid dendritic cells originate from haematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow; myeloid dendritic cells probably differentiate alternatively into macrophages direct from monocytes. As immature dendritic cells, they migrate from the blood into almost all tissues of the body, where they establish a dense network of sentinel cells, which ingest extracellular components by phagocytosis and endocytosis, similarly to neutrophils and macrophages. The Langerhans cells of the skin and mucous membranes, the Kupffer cells of the liver, the interdigitating cells of the spleen and lymph nodes, interstitial dendritic cells and the M cells of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue are tissue dendritic cells. They constantly check their environment for invasion and the presence of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi), which they recognize by interacting with receptors of the pattern recognition receptor family. These include TLRs that recognize pathogen-specific structures and bind to them (Sect. 7.1.5). In dendritic cells these contacts induce the synthesis and secretion of large amounts of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b2 (INF-\u03b2) as well as proinflammatory cytokines; this gives rise to the activation of granulocytes and macrophages, which move to the infection site. In the course of this process, dendritic cells mature and phagocytose the pathogens. Like macrophages, they can present peptides which result from the degradation of pathogen proteins in complex with MHC class II proteins on their cell surface, thus inducing the defence responses of the specific immune system. Unlike macrophages, dendritic cells are able to leave the tissues to which they had migrated, and reach in activated form, via streaming lymph fluid, the spleen and lymph nodes, the local organizing centres of the immune defence. There, they interact as antigen-presenting cells with B and T lymphocytes, and thus are decisively involved in the induction of the specific immune response: they activate TH lymphocytes and macrophages, regulate the cytokine pattern of the emerging TH lymphocytes into interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-producing TH1 cells or IL-4 producing TH2 cells, initiate the formation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and induce, using the assistance of T cells, the differentiation of plasma cells into antibody-producing B lymphocytes. Therefore, dendritic cells are highly specialized to stimulate specific immune responses and are an important link between the unspecific and the specific immune defence systems.",

By contrast, on their surface they have Fc immunoglobulin receptors and C3 complement receptors through which they bind to antigen\u2013antibody complexes.

            "text": "In particular, neutrophils, which represent the largest subpopulation (about 90 %), are involved in the first defence mechanisms against viral infections; humans produce about 1011 neutrophils per day. During the first few hours after their formation they still do not have a segmented nucleus; thus they are called unsegmented. To reach the infected tissue, neutrophils leave the bloodstream and the vascular system in a multistage process that is mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokines (chemotactic, soluble, attracting proteins which are released by activated dendritic cells). They attach to endothelial cells by adhesion molecules on their cell surfaces, such as L-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, which in turn \u2013 also chemokine-mediated\u2013produce the corresponding ligands (E-selectin and P selectin, integrins). This enables granulocytes to pass through the intercellular spaces of the endothelium which line the blood capillaries. In the course of this, they migrate to the inflammation or infection sites along a concentration gradient of chemokines, to which they bind by the corresponding chemokine receptors on their surface, and are the first immune cells to arrive there. Upon contact with the pathogens, neutrophils release the content of their granules into the surrounding region, or they phagocytose the pathogens. These are then surrounded by membrane vesicles, the phagosomes, which fuse with intracellular granules to form phagolysosomes. In this way, the agents are confronted with a plethora of degrading enzymes (including proteases, lysozymes, myeloperoxidases, hydrolases and muraminidases) and are killed. Granulocytes are stimulated by interaction with pathogens. As a result, granulocytes produce a variety of inflammatory factors such as IL-8, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. In particular, IL-8 has a chemotactic effect and lures more granulocytes and T lymphocytes to the infection site. The substances released act not only in an immunoregulatory manner. Some of them, e.g. IL-1, are also involved in the development of fever and the increase of algesthesia. Phagocytosis is more effective when the surfaces of the pathogens are complexed with antibodies, which are generated at a later stage of infection. It is part of the antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). If neutrophils are not activated during the first 6 h after their emergence, i.e. if they not were confronted with infectious and/or inflammatory reactions, apoptosis will naturally be induced in them; dead granulocytes are then degraded in the liver by the macrophages that reside in this organ.",

Their function is very similar to that of basophils. The main function of eosinophils is defence against large extracellular parasites, which cannot be phagocytosed owing to their size, such as worms (helminths). Eosinophils are attracted by chemotactic substances, attach to the parasites and pour out the content of their granules to the surrounding region, i.e. enzymes, oxygen radicals and cytotoxic proteins such as major basic protein (MBP); MBP is a group of small, arginine-rich proteins that are toxic to helminths, but also to mammalian cells, especially the cells of the bronchial epithelium. Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosing small pathogens or IgE-containing immune complexes. Basophils and mast cells are involved in the development of allergic immune reactions, as they have IgE receptors on their surface and release histamine, heparin, proteases and leukotrienes upon attachment of IgE-containing antigen\u2013antibody complexes. Histamines are also released upon contact of mast cells with MBP of eosinophils, which respond in turn with the release of histaminase and arylsulphatase, thus counteracting the histamine release. Disturbances in these processes can lead to allergic reactions.",

            "text": "Monocytes and macrophages belong, along with granulocytes and dendritic cells, to the mononuclear phagocytes, which are the most important cells of the innate immune system. Approximately 2\u20138 % of blood cells are monocytes. They are large, contain many lysosomes in their cytoplasm and have a well-pronounced Golgi apparatus. Both MHC class I and MHC class II proteins are anchored in their cell membrane. Monocytes originate from myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow, which initially develop to monoblasts under the influence of growth factors such as granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor and monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Monoblasts further differentiate into monocytes, which leave the bone marrow and circulate for 20\u201330 h in the blood before they migrate as macrophages into different tissue and organ systems. Similar to neutrophils, macrophages also follow the paths that are mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokines, leave the bloodstream and arrive early at the infection site. They can ingest and digest foreign material by phagocytosis, i.e. pathogens or protein components derived from them. During this process, peptides are formed from digested proteins. These peptides interact with MHC class II proteins, and are finally presented on the cell surface of monocytes and macrophages. In this way, they become antigen-presenting cells that activate the specific immune system, namely the TH lymphocytes (Sect. 7.2.1). Furthermore, activated macrophages produce specific surface proteins such as CD14, CD16 and CD86 (CD stands for cluster of differentiation), and TLR2 and TLR4. Like TLR2 and TLR4, CD14 interacts with lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin)-negative bacteria. If these receptors come in contact with lipopolysaccharides, they stimulate macrophages to phagocytose foreign material and to release inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6.",

            "text": "Natural killer cells (NK cells) originate from precursor cells in the bone marrow. Unlike T lymphocytes, NK cells remain in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, where they develop into large, granular lymphocytes, which possess characteristic surface markers. One of their principal functions is the clearance of virus-infected cells and tumour cells. NK cells induce apoptosis preferentially in cells that exhibit very low levels of MHC molecules on their surface. This mode of recognition and elimination of virus-infected and transformed cells is of crucial importance, as they often reduce the number of MHC proteins on their surfaces in order to escape the MHC-dependent specific immune responses. Fundamentally, NK cells are programmed to destroy all nucleated cells. However, MHC class I molecules on the cell surface inhibit this activity; hence, NK cells selectively induce apoptosis in those cells that do not exhibit MHC class I expression. Therefore, NK cells have killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on their surface, which recognize and bind to MHC molecules. The KIR\u2013MHC interaction leads to an inhibitory signal that suppresses the killer activity of NK cells. If this interaction is absent, then killing activatory receptors, which are also anchored in the cell membrane of NK cells, release toxic messengers which induce apoptosis in cells with poor expression of MHC molecules. Unlike granulocytes and macrophages, NK cells are always functionally active; thus, they do not need to be converted into an activated state by binding of specific cytokines. However, their activity can be enhanced by IL-12 or IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, which are secreted, for example, by activated dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages. NK cells produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u03b1), which leads to further immunological activation steps (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8). Therefore, NK cells have, in addition to their cytotoxic effect, also an immunoregulatory importance.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are members of a family of proteins that belong to the non-specific, innate immune system. TLRs are found in all vertebrates, including fish and reptiles. Their name is derived from the Toll gene, which was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster. It displays homology to the gene that encodes the IL-1 receptor. This suggests that the TLRs are members of an evolutionarily very old system. More than ten different TLRs have been discovered in most animal species, including humans, some of which exist only in certain species, such as in mice, but not in humans. TLRs are produced especially in dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, and belong to the group of pattern-recognition receptors. They are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR11) or in the endosomal membrane (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) and serve to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These are structures that exist only on or in pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi). Therefore, TLRs endow the innate immune system with the ability to distinguish between \u201cself\u201d and \u201cnon-self\u201d. TLR1 interacts specifically with peptidoglycan components of Gram-positive bacteria, whereas TLR4 binds to lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria and TLR5 recognizes flagellin, a protein of bacterial flagella (Table 7.1). The specific recognition of viral pathogen structures is performed mainly by TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, which are anchored in the endosomal membrane: TLR3 binds double-stranded RNA, TLR7 and TLR8 interact with single-stranded RNA and TLR9 binds to unmethylated CpG motifs in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded RNAs are characteristic molecules that occur as genome components or intermediates of genome replication of RNA viruses; they do not exist in uninfected cells. The same applies to single-stranded DNA or unmethylated CpG motifs. These virus-specific components make contact with TLRs after they have been phagocytosed by dendritic cells, and are present in endosomes (Fig. 7.1). Intracellular signalling cascades are induced after interaction of various TLRs with different pathogen-specific ligand structures by means of their leucine-rich domains, which are located extracellularly or in the endosomal lumen. Some TLRs can also form heterodimeric complexes, the ligand-binding properties of which are then modified or can overlap. As a result of ligand binding, Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain proteins, such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and similar proteins that act as adapters, can attach to the conserved TIR domains of different TLRs, which are oriented to the cytoplasm. This multistage process that involves IL-1 receptor associated kinases leads to the activation of members of the I\u03ba\u03b2 kinase (IKK) family, which phosphorylate I\u03ba\u03b2, the inhibitor of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB). As a consequence, the transcriptional factor NF\u03baB can enter the nucleus and induce the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion proteins. Some members of the IKK family phosphorylate interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7, which thus exert their activity as transactive proteins inducing the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Alternatively, the signal translation can also be MyD88-independent by addition of (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-\u00df (TRIF) to the TIR domains of TLRs involving the participation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Nevertheless, all the different pathways converge in the activation of the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion factors as well as class I interferons.\n\n",

            "text": "Complement is one of the most important mediators of inflammatory reactions. Inflammation is a consequence of infection, and is causally connected with the processes that are induced by the non-specific immune response. Complement is activated by two different pathways: the so-called classical pathway and the alternative activation pathway. However, both lead to the same mechanism, the lysis of virus-infected cells, bacteria, parasites or tumour cells. The classical pathway is induced by antigen\u2013antibody complexes. By contrast, the alternative pathway is activated independently of the presence of immunoglobulins. The complement system connects the specific and the non-specific part of the immune system, but it is also a link between the cellular and the humoral branch of the immune response. Both complement activation pathways are based on several factors, which activate each other in a cascade-like process. The central reaction in which the two pathways converge is the proteolytic cleavage of complement component C3 into C3a and C3b by C3 convertase. In the alternative pathway, this transformation is induced spontaneously by certain sugar structures on the surface of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa as well as tumour and virus-infected cells. In the classical pathway, it is indirectly triggered by antibodies bound to the surfaces of the respective pathogens or cells. The three subcomponents C1q, C1r and C1s attach to the Fc region of immunoglobulins to form the active unit (Fig. 7.2). This acts as a protease and processes component C4 and then component C2, whereupon the cleavage products C4b and C2a bind to the membrane surface of the target structure, i.e. the infected or transformed cell, the virus or bacterium, the fungus or protozoan. They form as a complex the above-mentioned C3 convertase of the classical pathway. During cleavage of C3, the conformation of the C3b subunit is modified in such a way that a reactive thioester bond is exposed. It reacts with functional side groups of amino acids, which are accessible on the surface of pathogens, cells or antigen\u2013antibody complexes. As a result, the C3b subunit is covalently bound. The C3b subunit marks the structures as foreign, thus giving rise to a signal that induces phagocytosis by granulocytes, macrophages and monocytes.\n",

By the T-cell receptor complex and the CD8 receptor, these cells bind to MHC class I proteins, which present peptide fragments of viral proteins as foreign components. MHC class I proteins or antigens are present on all cells of an organism, with the exception of brain cells (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_4). These proteins are heterodimers composed of a membrane-anchored \u03b1 chain and a \u03b22-microglobulin subunit (Fig. 7.3a). The surface-exposed moiety of the \u03b1 chain is divided into three domains, the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains are folded in such a way that an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet floor is formed, on which two \u03b1-helices are supported. The structure resembles a groove or cavity in which the \u00df-sheet forms the floor, and the \u03b1-helices shape the brims that line the trench (Fig. 7.4). Peptides with a length of approximately nine amino acids can be accommodated in this cavity. They are bound by a combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions. These peptides are fragments of viral proteins that are recognized as foreign by the T-cell receptor of cytotoxic T cells, which then binds to them. If the cell is not infected, the hole is occupied by peptides originating from the cell itself. These are not recognized as foreign because cytotoxic T cells with such specificities are retained in the thymus and eliminated during T-cell maturation. Loading of MHC class I proteins with peptides occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This requires an active synthesis of viral proteins, a situation that exists only in infected cells, in which the viral genes are expressed and translated into proteins during viral replication (Fig. 7.5a). After synthesis, a small proportion of them are delivered to the proteasome complex in the cytosol and are degraded. The resulting peptides are transported into the ER lumen by a peptide transporter (transport-associated protein) that is integrated in the ER membrane. There, the peptides are accommodated into the cavity of MHC class I molecules, which are synthesized in the ER as membrane-anchored proteins. During this process, the moiety that protrudes into the lumen is later exposed at the cell surface; before the formation of stable complexes with \u03b22-microglobulin and the peptide, the MHC \u03b1 chain is bound to calnexin, an ER-membrane-associated protein that acts as a chaperone preventing the MHC amino acid chain from prematurely adopting its final folded state. The finally formed complex of peptide, \u03b1 chain and \u03b22-microglobulin is transported through the Golgi vesicles and the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. It is anchored in the membrane, where it can be recognized by the T-cell receptors of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Then, T lymphocytes release cytotoxic factors (granzymes), radicals and perforins. The latter oligomerize under the influence of Ca2+ ions, and are embedded in the membrane of the cell that was recognized as foreign, they intersperse it with pores, leading to cell lysis. A prerequisite for this process is that the corresponding T lymphocytes have been stimulated by cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, which are secreted by TH cells. Additionally, cytokines such as IL-1, TNF and IFN-\u03b1, which are released from the cells of the innate immune system, e.g. by activated macrophages, increase the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, they represent a close connection between the unspecific immune responses and the specific cytotoxic T-cell response. Cytotoxic T cells are also capable of triggering a suicide programme (apoptosis; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_5) by their Fas ligands via contact with Fas receptors on the surface of target cells. In addition to these cytotoxic functions aimed at killing antigen-presenting cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes can also bring about a non-cytotoxic antiviral response by releasing INF-\u03b3.\n\n",

HLA molecules can be classified into different haplotypes, which differ in the amino acid sequences of \u03b1 chains.

This high diversity in combination with the genetic inheritance rules determines that each person has his or her own set of HLA haplotypes. Thus, every human cell has a characteristic \u201cmake up\u201d, except nerve cells and brain cells as well as certain cells of the eye. The different amino acid composition is primarily manifested in the residues lining the antigen-binding groove. Therefore, the different HLA haplotypes can bind only specific peptide segments. Today, it is known that this is the reason for the different genetic ability of individuals to react immunologically to infectious diseases. For example, if an individual has an HLA subtype that can poorly bind peptides of a specific viral protein, the respective infected cells will be neither recognized nor eliminated.",

B cells originate from bone marrow pluripotent stem cells, which are the progenitors of all haematopoietic cells, and develop into precursor B cells by the influence of cytokines (IL-3). IL-4, IL-5 und IL-6 are necessary for further differentiation into pre-B cells. During this process, somatic recombinations occur at the DNA level, and lead to rearrangements of the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. Initially, the D and J segments of heavy chains are mutually combined. Subsequently, one of more than 100 V segments is randomly added in front, so that a defined arrangement of VDJ regions is present in the pre-B cell. These are joined to the constant regions of the \u03bc chain by splicing. Subsequently, the V and J segments of the light \u03b1 and \u03ba chains are rearranged and linked with the C regions by splicing during transcription. The corresponding protein chains are synthesized, and are transported to the cell surface. In this phase, pre-B cells have membrane-bound IgM molecules on their surfaces and secrete small amounts of IgM molecules with the corresponding specificities. The many millions of possible combinations of the VDJ regions of heavy chains, or the VJ segments of light chains, give rise to the huge antibody diversity, which ensures that virtually for every potential antigen, there is a specific IgM molecule. They are continuously present in low concentrations in the relevant cells as well as in the peripheral blood, and can neutralize pathogens. The soluble IgM antibodies form complexes with antigens and act as inducers of the complement cascade. On the other hand, the membrane-associated IgM molecules act as antigen receptors and induce the incorporation of the resulting membrane-bound antigen\u2013antibody complex. The proteins are degraded in the endosomes, where foreign antigen peptides can bind to HLA class II proteins. From there they return to the cell surface as an MHC complex. In this phase, pre-B cells become antigen-presenting cells, which are bound by TH cells with the corresponding specificities of T-cell receptors, and then produce a large number of different cytokines (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8). Thereby, B cells are stimulated to proliferate, and differentiate into plasma cells. The immunoglobulin class switch also occurs in this phase, i.e. the variable domains of heavy chains are combined by alternative splicing with the corresponding segments of \u03b3 chains or \u2013 depending on the cytokine signals received \u2013 the other heavy chains.

This clonal selection ensures that no TH cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with self-specificities are present in the organism.

After a relevant infection, cytotoxic T lymphocytes may be present, and these attack and destroy the body\u2019s own cells. Cross-reactive TH cells can induce the production of immunoglobulins that are directed against cellular proteins. The resulting antigen\u2013antibody complexes can trigger all kinds of defence responses, ranging from the attack of neutrophils with the release of inflammatory factors to the activation of the complement cascade with its cell-damaging effects. If these complexes accumulate in the synovial space, then the induced immune responses can cause severe arthritis. Such processes are a possible cause of postinfectious reactive arthritis that, for example, is associated with rubella virus or parvovirus infections (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).",

            "text": "However, there are also other mechanisms. During the primary infection, Epstein\u2013Barr virus induces infectious mononucleosis, a polyclonal activation of T cells that react with an increased cytokine release, and thus also stimulate B cells polyclonally (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Many B and T lymphocytes are stimulated regardless of the antigen specificity. In many patients with an acute Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection, immune responses against various endogenous structures are found; the increased activation rate is manifested as lymph node swelling and lymphadenopathy. The organism reacts to viral infections with the production of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. These interferons induce, among other things, an increased expression of MHC class I and MHC class II proteins on the surface of uninfected cells. This MHC overexpression can lead to immunological side effects, and the corresponding cells can be attacked by T lymphocytes. In the case of Epstein\u2013Barr virus infections, this leads to mononucleosis. In this case, the non-specific proliferation can lead to monoclonal or polyclonal malignant cells and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma by additional, long-lasting stimulatory factors (such as malaria, chromosomal translocations). Even the effect of superantigens leads to immunological attack on the body\u2019s own cells. On the one hand, such protein molecules bind to specific V\u03b2 chains of T-cell receptors, and on the other hand, they bind to MHC class II proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In this way, both cell types are brought into contact with each other in an antigen-independent manner. This non-specific stimulation leads to oligoclonal expansion of T cells with certain \u03b2 chains in the receptors, which are also directed against the body\u2019s own cellular structures. In addition, the release of corresponding cytokines can be observed. There is evidence that rabies virus, mouse mammary tumour virus and several other retroviruses \u2013 possibly also HIV \u2013 have superantigens (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18).",

This ability can often be attributed to inaccurately functioning viral enzymes such as RNA polymerases, which usually replicate the viral genomes. Consequently, especially RNA viruses (e.g. hepatitis C virus, HIV and influenza viruses) exhibit very high mutation rates, and continuously change the sequence and structures of their surface-exposed protein regions under the selective pressure of antibodies, and thus escape the neutralizing effect of immunoglobulins (quasi-species; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). Furthermore, HIV alters the cytokine and chemokine patterns that are produced by infected cells. As a result, the immune system and in particular the cytotoxic T lymphocytes become ineffective (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18).",

By contrast, hepatitis B viruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19) produce large amounts of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during infection, which is then present in high concentrations in the blood and is captured by HBsAg-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

            "text": "In addition to these rather untargeted mechanisms to evade the immune response, many viruses, especially DNA viruses, have developed special approaches by which they can specifically suppress defence responses. This enables them to establish persistent infections. The commonest strategy is the reduction of MHC antigens on the surface of infected cells. This impedes recognition by the cellular immune response; this alternative is used by adenoviruses, herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 8 and Epstein\u2013Barr virus) and also by human immunodeficiency viruses. The infected cells can no longer present viral peptide antigens, cytotoxic T lymphocytes do not recognize infected cells and the virus escapes elimination (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). The molecular mechanisms which viruses have developed for this purpose are varied: by the action of specific viral proteins, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses retain newly synthesized MHC class I proteins in the ER, and hinder their transport to the cell surface. On the other hand, human immunodeficiency viruses has protein functions which destabilize the surface-exposed MHC proteins in order to induce their endocytosis and subsequent proteolytic degradation. To prevent MHC-depleted cells being attacked by NK cells, cytomegaloviruses encode an additional MHC class I protein homologue that interacts with KIR receptors, thus preventing the development of the cytotoxic activity of NK cells (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). De facto, in almost all immune attack strategies against viruses, there are examples of specific escape or infiltration strategies in the context of viral immune evasion.",

To avoid this non-specific immune response, several viruses interfere with the signalling pathways that activate the expression of interferon genes. They prevent the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and induce their degradation (paramyxoviruses; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15) and have protein components that inhibit the activity of protein kinase R or 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase, impede its binding to double-stranded RNA, or degrade it (reoviruses, human immunodeficiency viruses, adenoviruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, poxviruses; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_17, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19\u201310.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Alternatively, many viruses have developed mechanisms that inhibit cytokine synthesis or restrict their effects. Asfarviruses code for a protein with homology to the factor I\u03ba\u03b2, which prevents activation of NF\u03baB, and thus inhibits the synthesis of many immunologically important gene products by interfering with the signalling pathway (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Especially, pox viruses, but also some herpesviruses, produce proteins that are homologous to different cytokines or chemokine receptors, which are secreted by infected cells and intercept the soluble mediators of the innate immune response in the blood (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19).
