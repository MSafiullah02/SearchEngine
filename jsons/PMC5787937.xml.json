Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in Sudan, and the other in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.[1] The 2014 Ebola epidemic was the largest in history, affecting Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Mali in West Africa. Ebola is by no means the first to plague the world. Notable pandemics over time include smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, leprosy, malaria, yellow fever, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Avian flu, and HIV/AIDS. The Director-General of WHO on August 8 declared the EVD outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (IHRs) (2005). This is the third time WHO declares a PHEIC following the H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009 and the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014.[2]",
