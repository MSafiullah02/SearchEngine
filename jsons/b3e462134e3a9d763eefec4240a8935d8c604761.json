COVID-19 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness, and its main clinical manifestations are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue [2, 3] .

Radiological examinations are relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and may demonstrate normal findings in early stage of infection. In contrast, thin-section chest CT examination plays a key role in assisting diagnosis. To date, considerable knowledge gaps remain in the chest CT imaging features of COVID- 19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to quantitatively summarize results from published studies to date to provide a more precise estimate of detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and report on the most common imaging findings on chest CT imaging.",

Statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic [4] . For the Q statistic, a P value < .10 was considered statistically significant for heterogeneity; for I 2 , a value >50% was considered to have severe heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by constructing a funnel plot and by Egger's test [5] . For Egger's test, a P value < .10 was considered statistically significant.

Still, there seems to be unique imaging characteristics for COVID-19. Unilateral involvement is more common in the early stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome [29, 30] . In contrast, COVID-19 infection seems to be more commonly bilateral. In this meta-analysis, most patients had bilateral lung involvement, especially the bilateral lower lobes. Overall, 70% of patients had three or more lobes involved. Our meta-analysis has several strengths. First, the number of cases included was relatively large for 3 months of early publications, providing aggregate evidence for evaluating diagnosis of COVID-19 by chest CT. Second, the included studies were conducted in different hospitals and settings, making the results more generalizable. Third, in this analysis, we extract varieties of different imaging features, including both specific imaging features and distribution patterns in the lungs.",
