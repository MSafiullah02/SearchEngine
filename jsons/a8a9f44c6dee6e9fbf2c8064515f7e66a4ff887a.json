Cybersecurity is therefore a balancing act involving an adequate level of protection against known or postulated threats while still allowing systems and their users to carry out their legitimate functions and accomplish their business objectives or operational missions. For example, a classic dilemma facing a security architect today is the unanticipated user, an external party who is not known to a system a priori, and may very well not even be physically located at the system, but who nevertheless has permissions granted by a higher authority to access functions and data. The security design must then ensure that such legitimate users are granted access, while imposters are blocked with acceptably low error rates.",

A typical security architecture begins with the most thorough analysis possible of the sources and methods of system attack. The security architect then follows an orderly process of selecting and applying protective measures while ensuring that a system can still accomplish its purpose with acceptable impacts on performance, cost, reliability, and long-term evolution. Security design often uses products with defined assurance levels and employs design patterns, security protocols, and standards to achieve an acceptable level of security risk. This chapter describes a typical security architecture process and introduces some terminology and design approaches. The objective is to enable a general system architect to appreciate the dimensions of the security challenge, to interact more effectively with security specialists, and to ensure compliance with security policies. There are frequent references to Department of Defense (DoD) security policies and practices both because of the importance of protecting classified information and because much of the security technology and many standards and implementation methods, which are used throughout information technology (IT) systems, derive from the experience and investments of the Defense community.",

Figure 10 .2 is a graphical portrayal of the main elements of a cyberattack and introduces some standard terms. An Asset is any information, process, or other system content that requires protection. Assets are potentially at risk if the system has Vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit. Collectively, these vulnerabilities constitute the system's Attack Surface, and a primary goal of secure architecture is to minimize this. An asset such as a database typically has Attributes that are the specific items sought by an attacker. A Threat is created by a Threat Agent who seeks to exploit a vulnerability to steal, corrupt, delete, or otherwise harm an asset. Then if the system has safeguards, properly called Security Controls, that adequately mitigate the vulnerability, the asset is protected; otherwise, there can be an Exposure or data breach. The structure in Fig. 10 .2 is the basis for the Vocabulary for Event Reporting and Incident Sharing (VERIS) [2] which asks \"What Threat Actor took what Action on what Asset to compromise what Attribute,\" referred to as the 4 As, and is widely used in reporting and compiling information on cybersecurity events.",

Next comes threat analysis, involving identification and definition of known and potential threats, consequences of an exploitation, the estimated frequency of threat events, and the probability that a potential threat will materialize. The third element of RI is vulnerability assessment. This can draw on a variety of sources, including published lists of vulnerabilities, a history of security events, and results of vulnerability testing. Now comes risk analysis (RA), which can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative RA has advantages in devising an optimum cybersecurity solution but requires more information and more effort. It attempts to assign a numerical value or cost to assets and threats to support cost/benefit analysis and more clear and concise characterization of particular risks. NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for IT Systems [9] , defines a nine-step risk assessment process.

As with architecture strategy in general, this flow is highly iterative, and results at any step may cause a return to an earlier step to correct a problem, refine a requirement, perform additional analysis on a discovered issue, and so forth. By making this an integral part of an MBSAP effort, security architecture becomes an integral part of the overall architecture of a secure system or enterprise, not something that is ad hoc or independent. Cybersecurity requirements, functions, and standards will impact many aspects of the system and may be the dominant factor in decisions such as product selections. Security testing involves a distinct set of events, but it must be integrated with the overall test plan to ensure all required data is collected at minimum cost and effort.

A DMZ can be implemented with one or two firewalls, the latter being more secure. Figure 10 .7 shows the DMZ, accessed through a DMZ Switch, lying between the External and Internal Firewalls and hosting functions like an Email Server, a Web Server, and one or more Proxy Servers that expose data and processes from system servers without allowing direct access to those resources. An Email Gateway is a server that accepts, forwards, delivers, and stores messages on behalf of system users. It typically also scans messages and attachments for viruses and other malicious content and can perform filtering to eliminate unwanted traffic (the notorious \"spam\"). A DMZ typically creates a \"holding pen\" for traffic to which the firewall can send suspicious incoming messages for additional processing before delivery or deletion.

The current trend is toward policy-based security management in which rule sets take into account a variety of circumstances and make near real-time adjustments. For example, a specific individual might need access to specific data for a specific period of time, after which this privilege should be revoked. Or the access rules might need to become more stringent in response to a detected hostile penetration attempt. One implementation uses a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), shown interacting with the External Firewall in Fig. 10 .7, which is usually a dedicated computer that mediates user access requests, message traffic, and other activities on the basis of a set of policy attributes. In a typical situation, a user would request access to an application or data set, and the PEP would obtain the user's certificate and other attributes (see Access Control below); would apply current policy, provided by a Policy Definition Point (PDP), to determine if the requested access is allowed; and, if so, would authorize the requested activity.

The Kerberos protocol, defined in RFC 4120 from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is the most common standard for mutual authentication between computers [18] . A Digital Certificate (or Public Key Certificate) is a document that binds a public key to one or more identification attributes of the key issuer, who may be the recipient of secure messaging or the client of a service provider. An enterprise can create a PKI that provides for issuing authentication credentials, such as an identity card with an embedded electronic certificate, to participants and can provide services such as certificate revocation if a credential is withdrawn or compromised, using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). An alternative to PKI is called a Web of Trust scheme in which individual participants in an enterprise digitally sign their own certificates which are then attested by a third party. A popular implementation of this approach is Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), which allows use of email digital signatures and lets participants publish their public keys. A Web of Trust can interoperate with a PKI if 5 Hashing is the application of an algorithm to a digital data object of arbitrary size to create a value of fixed size that can serve as a kind of fingerprint of the original; many hash algorithms are used. Certificates can be used as part of a Non-Repudiation implementation, e.g., by using proof-of-origin and proof-of-receipt, as evidence that an individual participated in a transaction. There is precedent that an RSA signature (see next paragraph) with non-repudiation is legally binding. Many encryption algorithms exist, and NSA develops and applies suites of algorithms for protecting US Government information. Two of the most widely used in private information systems are the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [19] and the RSA encryption algorithm, named for its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Alderman [20] . An algorithm is often described in terms of the length of time a code breaker with high-end computing resources would need to penetrate it, which may range from minutes to years.",

It is different, however, in that periodic discrete C&A events are replaced by a continuous process of monitoring and assessment to ensure the integrity and policy compliance of the information protection solution. Under NIST guidance, RMF also calls for deploying more, and more effective, security controls. The RMF approach has six steps: \u2022 Categorize the system and its information content. \u2022 Select the baseline security controls, with tailoring and supplementation as needed. \u2022 Implement the controls. \u2022 Assess the controls as implemented for effectiveness and appropriateness.",

The CC structure allows security requirements for an item to be specified in a way that allows a product to be tested against them. Security requirements for a class of devices are captured in a Protection Profile (PP), and one or more PPs are used in compiling a Security Target (ST) that defines the security properties of a product and a set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs). PPs are oriented toward allowing users to define their needs, while STs allow providers to spell out the security their products provide.

Government agencies typically mandate an EAL for a component of a secure system based on the sensitivity of the information being protected and the nature of the threat [34] . For example, information whose compromise would cause some damage (roughly equivalent to a classification of Confidential or Company Private) and that faces a threat characterized as unsophisticated but willing to take risks (perhaps a basic hacker) warrants an EAL of 2. Information whose compromise would cause exceptionally severe damage (e.g., a classification of Top Secret or key intellectual property) with a sophisticated adversary who has reasonable resources and will take significant risks (perhaps a major terrorist organization) calls for an EAL of 6, which many commercial products cannot meet.

The two most prominent cases involve the Web, which essentially means the Internet, and the use of Cloud Computing. As discussed in Chap. 7, Service-Oriented Architecture is predicated on allowing multiple participants in an enterprise, who may come and go unpredictably and who use multiple information technologies, to interact in implementing business processes. However, proliferating access to data and resources inevitably creates security vulnerabilities. In addition to all the other cybersecurity measures discussed in this chapter, a SOA needs robust mechanisms for assuring confidentiality, integrity, and access for the services that are exposed and consumed by enterprise participants. Because Web services are the overwhelming choice today for SOA interactions, they are the focus of efforts to achieve security. For a long time, the primary mechanism for protecting SOAP messages has been HTTPS, the secure version of the Hypertext Transmission Protocol. This encrypts an entire message and is adequately secure for a point-to-point transaction. However, Web traffic increasingly includes intermediate nodes that must read parts of a message in order to perform their functions and therefore, with HTTPS, must decode the entire message. With the sensitive content now exposed in multiple places, the level of security risk goes up significantly. The inflexibility of HTTPS and the overall need to move to higher QoP have motivated the creation of the WS-Security Framework, anchored in the WS-Security standard. Repeating the list from Chap. 7, the WS-Security Framework deals with identification, authentication, authorization, WS-Security defines language elements for security metadata, including header blocks, usernames, passwords, and tokens. It provides an overall means of associating security tokens with messages, incorporates security features in the header of a SOAP message, and provides integrity (anti-tamper), confidentiality (encryption), and various authentication and authorization mechanisms, including proof-of-origin certification. WS-Security allows selective encryption/decryption of message elements. In conjunction with WS-Security message encryption, a Kerberos or PKI service is commonly used to distribute session keys so that participants do not have to create, store, and protect large amounts of key material.",
