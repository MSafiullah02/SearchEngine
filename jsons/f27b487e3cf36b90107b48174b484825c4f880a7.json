The vertical hinged door is suitable to be set between the buffer room and the corridor. In both cases, the wooden door should not be used. 4. When it is possible, the advantage is more obvious if the sliding door is adopted between the isolation ward and the buffer room. In this case, the velocity of the induced turbulence by the sliding door is the minimum, compared with that of the vertical hinged door. Therefore, the sliding door is recommended for the entrance of the isolation ward in related standards in Japan. This is also recommended in AIA standard in U.S.A. and it is also pointed out that the sliding slot should not be set on the floor for this kind of the sliding door. Therefore the upper suspected sliding door should be used, which is the same as that of the clean operating room. Of course, whether the sliding door can be set depends on the space of the buffer room.

It is understandable that these provisional measures were specified. But during the East Asia Rainy Season (or Meiyu Season) and the hot summer in the southern region where the humidity is extremely large, the propagation of pathogenic microbes indoors cannot be prevented in hospitals by natural ventilation alone. In this case, the microbial contamination may still occur. If the temperature and the humidity indoors are very high, the patient will generate heat and sweat, which will increase the bacterial generation rate. When the medical personnel wear the insulation garment, the protective cloth, the mask and eyeglasses, sweating will occur soon after the work. Sometimes febrile disease may even appear.

This means when the flow rate of the exhaust air is less than 85 m 3 /h, the requirement for the negative pressure is satisfied. Based on the data in Table 2 .4, For the ward where the door of the room is not air-tight, this flow rate of the exhaust air is equivalent to the pressure difference with value slightly more than 1 Pa indoors.
