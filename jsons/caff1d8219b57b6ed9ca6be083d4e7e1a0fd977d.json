LAMP exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity due to an exponential amplification feature that utilises 6 different target sequences simultaneously identified by separate distinct primers in the same reaction [20] . LAMP assays are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection [3] . First, FIP anneals to the template, and extension occurs using a polymerase with displacement activity (such as Bst polymerase), which will displace the product obtained from FIP by the extension reaction associated with the F3 primer. Subsequently, an extension reaction occurs using BIP on the product of FIP, and not on the template DNA due to displacement by DNA synthesis associated with the B3 primer. These reactions result in a product with a dumbbell-like structure which is essential for LAMP to establish isothermal amplification as the loop structures are always single stranded and can be annealed by FIP or BIP. This loop structure formation eliminates the denaturing step, which is otherwise essential in PCR for obtaining single-stranded DNA, and also establishes a cyclic reaction between the dumbbell-like structure and its complementary product, leading to elongated products with various copies of the target sequence produced (for reviews and detailed schematics, refer to [22, 23] ).",

Of course, however, as with any emerging technology, there are some disadvantages associated with LAMP assays. Such methodology prevents inclusion of an internal PCR inhibition control, necessitating duplication of reactions while testing. Another disadvantage is the perceived complexity of the methodology, requiring a complex primer design system which can constrain target site selection and resolution or specificity. Furthermore, as the final product is a large fragment, downstream applications such as cloning are limited.",

These results were further verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with performance comparable to commercial RT-PCR tests, requiring only heating and visual inspection. Intriguingly, results obtained were also comparable between 'spiked' RNA samples and patient samples, suggesting that the improved methodology of El-Tholoth et al., [32] should yield satisfactory results with patient samples (Figure 2 ).

Indeed, the Penn-RAMP methodology when applied on mock trials by El-Tholoth et al., [32] provided a success rate of 100% at 7-10 copies of viral RNA per reaction, compared to a 100% success rate at 700 viral RNA copies required for PCR methods [32, 35] .

Indeed, several viral epidemics over the past few decades have emerged with increasing frequency, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), H1N1 influenza, and more recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1]. Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged from its epicentre in Wuhan province in China, and its subsequent rapid spread has pushed the capacity of the global public health community to its sheer limits. As of 30 March 2020, there were 752,747 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 36,226 deaths recorded worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Many nations have employed combinations of containment and mitigation activities, intended to delay major surges of patients and levelling demand for care, while protecting the most vulnerable from infection",
