Even with radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, 5-year survival remains very poor (about 20%).1 To improve survival of patients with PDAC, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. One of the main focuses of current research in this field aims at identifying new molecular targets and subgroups of PDAC that may benefit from personalised treatment, opening new landscapes for the so-called \u2018precision oncology\u2019.2\n",

Microsatellites are short and very repetitive sequences of 1\u20136 DNA base pairs that are found throughout the genome. Due to the repetitive nature, their alteration is typically present in cases of dMMR and is defined as MSI.3 4 Tumours with MSI/dMMR usually accumulate thousands of mutations and are characterised by a hypermutated genome. Interestingly, this condition can be tested using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular tests, including classic (PCR)-based microsatellite testing and novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches.4\n",

Specifically, one author (CL) extracted data from the included articles and a second independent author (AS) validated the data. For each article, information about authors, year of publication, country of origin of the analysed cohort, number of patients, number of MSI/dMMR tumours, histological and molecular data on MSI/dMMR tumours, methods for MSI/dMMR testing, presence of Lynch syndrome and survival outcomes was extracted. Finally, all extracted data were reported and summarised in table 1, and then analysed, interpreted and discussed by all authors. To assess for differences in histological features between PDAC in unselected patients versus those with dMMR/MSI, a Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare our results with a large published cohort, specifically reporting the histological subtypes of patients with familial and sporadic pancreatic cancers.7 This method has also been recently used by Hruban et al to compare the histology of an original cohort of ATM-mutated PDAC with that of conventional PDAC.8 To further corroborate our results, a comparison was also carried out considering patients from the SEER database as another validation cohort.9 In order to assess for differences in additional molecular features between PDAC in unselected patients versus those with dMMR/MSI, a Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare our results with data published by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA), which we used as a reference cohort.10 Furthermore, availing the manuscripts selected for this systematic review to assess differences in terms of survival, a meta-analysis comparing the prognostic outcomes of MSI/dMMR PDAC versus non-MSI/dMMR PDAC was performed using the programmes \u2018Comprehensive Meta-Analysis\u2019 and \u2018RevMan 5\u2019 (http://www.meta-analysis.com, last access 9 March 2020). Lastly, in order to define the presence of any potentially specific driver gene in MSI/dMMR PDAC, we analysed the existing literature on genetic drivers in MSI/dMMR tumours and reviewed, using linear comparisons, all available sequencing data from our systematic review.",

Of these, the total number of reported MSI/dMMR PDACs was 218, which corresponds to 2.61% of all patients with PDAC. This percentage represents a slight overestimation of the real prevalence of MSI/dMMR PDAC, since some studies are focused on PDAC subtypes apparently enriched by this molecular alteration. After removing those studies, the real prevalence of MSI/dMMR tumours was 2.53%. Regarding the methodology to assess MSI/dMMR in PDAC, 23 studies used PCR, whereas 13 used IHC and 8 NGS (some studies used more than one method for MSI/dMMR assessment; table 1). However, the methods applied in different studies greatly varied, even in the case of the same category of analysis. In fact, 14 different PCRs were described, with only 6 studies (26% of all PCR-based studies) using the standardised NCI/MSI PCR markers.4 A similar situation was observed for IHC, with four different types of analyses and only seven studies (53.8%) using the standardised antibodies.",

Thus, the percentage of 2.5% appears as an overestimation of the real MSI/dMMR prevalence in PDAC. This may be due, at least in part, to the different and not validated methods used in the past for MSI/dMMR assessment. Indeed, 15 different PCR tests and 4 different IHC panels have been used considering all the studies selected for this systematic review. However, only six studies based on IHC/PCR used the suggested and standardised IHC antibodies and/or NCI/MSI PCR markers.9 47 48 It is also important to acknowledge that the NCI guidelines regarding MSI testing were first published in 1998,47 thus papers published up to this time could not have adopted an NCI panel. The most important MSI marker in the initial NCI guidelines was BAT26, which is a highly sensitive and specific marker of MSI. Some early manuscripts reported high levels of MSI-likely but these were potentially due to inappropriate microsatellite markers. Contrary to this situation, all studies based on NGS appeared more reliable: they used NGS coupled with validation tools, analysed larger cohorts and gave more homogeneous results, with a range of MSI/dMMR prevalence from 0% to 1.6% (mean value of 1.1%). Based on these considerations, the real prevalence of MSI/dMMR in PDAC could be reasonably considered to be around 1%\u20132%, or even less (<1%). Furthermore, along these lines, it is evident that the use of reliable and standardised procedures is mandatory.",

Indeed, medullary histology can be found in microsatellite stable PDAC, for example, in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.20 Similarly, mucinous/colloid features can be found in microsatellite stable PDAC, for example, in association with GNAS (also in association with pre-existing IPMN) or germline-ATM mutations.8 38 50 It should be reiterated here that medullary and colloid carcinoma are significantly more common in the ampulla than in the pancreas, and considering the well-known proneness of ampullary cancers to be mistaken as pancreatic origin,51 in a case with this diagnosis, the possibility of a secondary invasion from the ampulla, or even a metastasis from the colon ought to be carefully excluded.52 However, due to the strong association of these two PDAC variants with MSI/dMMR, for cases of medullary and mucinous/colloid histology, the final pathology report should be integrated with the assessment of MSI/dMMR status. This should be performed using IHC as first-line analysis, also following existing guidelines,4 and, only in the case of doubtful or not reliable IHC results, MSI-based PCR should be executed. Considering the different advantages and limitations of the methods of MSI testing in PDAC (which have been summarised in table 2), NGS is recommended as first-line analysis in the case of limited tissue, and in the context of precision oncology.",

Indeed, KRAS wild-type PDAC, although unusual, include a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that may have potential targets for precision medicine. These comprise MSI/dMMR, and other important genetic alterations, such as those involving BRAF gene, and kinase fusion genes (eg, FGFR2 and NTRK fusions).44 53 Notably, one case with FGFR2 fusion has been described in the context of MSI/dMMR.44 Moreover, TMB resulted high in the majority of MSI/dMMR PDAC, and this represents another variable strictly associated with benefits from immunotherapy. Further studies in PDAC should also address whether better response to immunotherapy could be reached where there is co-existence of MSI/dMMR and high TMB, such as in colorectal cancer.54 We also found additional potential driver genes typically involved in MSI/dMMR PDAC: JAK (JAK1 and JAK3) and KMT2 (KMT2C and KMT2D). JAK genes code for a homonymous family of kinases, which are required for the signalling of a host of immune modulators in tumour, stromal and immune cells; alterations in this family have been associated with an immune evasion by tumour cells.45\nKMT2 genes code for a homonymous family of methyl-transferases, which are the effectors of histone H3 methylation, one of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene transcription.46 In case of mutations, both JAK and KMT2 genes have been already described as potential drivers in MSI/dMMR tumours of other sites,45 46 and we highlighted their potential involvement also in MSI/dMMR PDAC, further refining the knowledge on the genetic landscape of this tumour entity.",

However, an update of the trial including a total of 22 MSI/dMMR patients with PDAC, showed only 4 out of 22 patients with objective responses (1 complete and 3 partial), which represented the lowest objective response among the different investigated cancers.57 These findings pointed out the potential differences, based on cancer site, of the response rate to immunotherapy of MSI/dMMR tumours and confirmed the complex biological and clinical nature of PDAC.",

Due to its very low prevalence and also on the basis of this systematic review, MSI/dMMR should be determined as first-line analysis and with specific tests (IHC, then MSI-based PCR only in case of doubtful results; NGS in case of limited tissue) during PDAC routine diagnostic activity only in case of typical histology (medullary or mucinous/colloid). Conversely, to search for new potential targets for precision oncology (eg, the FGFR-POC1B fusion described in a MSI/dMMR PDAC or other targets in non-MSI/dMMR PDAC), MSI should be assessed as second-line action ideally using NGS, to permit additional simultaneous analysis and potentially provide more options for treatment.",
