Its symptoms include high fever, chills, rigors, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, myalgias, lymphopenia, and chest infiltrates, which begin after an incubation period of 2-10 days. SARS initially appeared in southern China at the end of 2002 and was first recognized as a new disease entity by World Health Organization infectious-diseases expert Carlo Urbani. By the beginning of 2003, SARS had spread into 29 countries. The 2003 epidemic lasted 116 weeks and affected 8098 people, 774 of whom died. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was a striking feature of the epidemic. If another SARS epidemic were to occur, surveillance efforts in containing the secondary transmission of SARS-CoV would ideally be combined with better prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Despite the substantial number of cases and the intensive studies that have been conducted, the mechanism of the protective immune response against SARS-CoV remains unknown.",

It is conceivable that, in patients with mild disease, various adaptive and innate immune responses cooperate to control and eventually eradicate SARS-CoV infection in vivo. The cell-mediated antiviral mechanisms against CoVs involve T cells that express ab or gd T cell receptors (TCRs) [3] [4] [5] . Thus, we analyzed, \u223c3 months after the onset of disease, ab and gd T cell profiles in health care workers (HCWs) who had had SARS and had convalesced (SC-HCWs). In contrast to there being no measurable changes in the population of peripheralblood ab T cells, the effector memory Vg9Vd2 T cell population was selectively expanded in the peripheral blood of SC-HCWs. In addition, Vg9Vd2 T cells were able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells in vitro and to kill SARS-CoV-infected target cells, suggesting a potential role for Vg9Vd2 T cells in SARS immunosurveillance.",

Isotype-matched control MAbs from BD Biosciences were used to measure background staining. PBMCs were isolated by LeucoSep centrifugation (Arnica), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; incubated with individual MAbs for 15 min at 4\u040aC; washed in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide; fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde; and immediately analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Expression of CD45RA and CD27 molecules on Vb and Vd T cells was analyzed using the MAbs from BD Biosciences. Because the blood samples were obtained from convalescent healthy persons with normal lymphocyte counts, the percentage changes are also likely to reflect quantitative differences in T cell subset distributions. gd T cells from the control subjects were purified using magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech), stimulated with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP; 10 mmol/L; Sigma) plus interleukin (IL)-2 (100 U/mL; Boehringer Mannheim), and cocultured with Vero cells. To evaluate the noncytolytic antiviral activity of cellreleased soluble factors, gd T cells were plated on 1 \u03eb 6 1 \u03eb 10 10 4 Vero cells/mL of culture medium. The Vero cell cultures were maintained in flat-bottom 24-well plates and separated (from the stimulated gd T cells) by a semipermeable polycarbonate membrane with a 0.4-mm pore size (Transwell; BD Labware). After 24 h, the Vero cell cultures were infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01. The supernatants were collected 4 days afterward, and the TCID 50 per milliliter was determined as described elsewhere [6] . RNA was extracted using NucliSens isolation reagents (NASBA Diagnostics, Organon Teknica), and the number of SARS-CoV RNA copies was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (Artus). Moreover, Vd2 T cell lines (expression of Vd2 by 180% of cells) were obtained by stimulating the PBMCs from 2 control subjects with IPP (10 mmol/ L) and IL-2 (100 U/mL) for 12 days. The Vd2 T cell lines were then stimulated with IPP for another 24 h, and the supernatants that contained factors released by activated gd T cells (termed \"gd factors\" [GDFs]) from these cultures were diluted 1:2 and added to the Vero cell cultures ( cells/mL) for an addi- 5 1 \u03eb 10 tional 24 h. The cultures were then infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01. Twenty-four hours after infection, the Vero cell culture supernatants were collected, and the TCID 50 per milliliter was determined. A cytokine neutralization assay was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-interferon (IFN)-g (original titer, 50,000 neutralization units/mL). The concentration of antibody against IFN-g was 10,000 U/mL, that is, 10-100fold higher than that required to neutralize the IFN-g present in the supernatants of cultures in which gd T cells are stimulated with 10 mmol/L IPP.",

Both freshly purified gd T cells and gd T cell lines were used. Initially, gd T cells from the control subjects were purified by magnetic microbead selection and stimulated with IPP. Then, the gd T cells were cocultured with SARS-CoVinfected Vero cells separated from the gd T cells by a semipermeable membrane. In addition, Vg9Vd2 T cell lines were obtained by stimulating PBMCs from the control subjects with IPP and IL-2, and the resulting gd T cell lines were restimulated with IPP. The supernatants from these cultures that contained soluble molecules released by IPP-activated cell lines were tested for their anti-SARS-CoV activity. These experiments demonstrated that The presence of GDFs in the SARS-CoV-infected Vero cell cultures substantially reduced the quantity of SARS-CoV infectious units (measured as TCID 50 ) produced in the system, compared with that in control cultures ( figure 2A) . Also, the total viral load (measured as the number of SARS-CoV RNA copies) was con-siderably decreased in the presence of GDFs. Interestingly, the anti-SARS-CoV activity of the GDFs was completely abolished by the addition of an antibody against IFN-g ( figure 2A ). These results strongly suggest that IFN-g is at least partially responsible for the observed antiviral action of the GDFs. Additional experiments demonstrated that the GDFs complemented IFN-a in blocking SARS-CoV replication (data not shown), confirming a synergistic SARS-CoV-inhibitory activity of human type I and type II IFNs [9] . Finally, the Vg9Vd2 T cell/THP-1 cocultures were used to assess cytotoxic function and cytokine production. Our results demonstrated that production of IFN-g is augmented in Vg9Vd2 T cells stimulated by SARS-CoV in vitro (769.8 pg/ mL in uninfected cocultures vs. 979.0 pg/mL in SARS-CoVinfected cocultures) ( figure 2B ). In addition, analysis of hypodip-loid nuclei demonstrated a substantial increase in the cytotoxicity of Vg9Vd2 T cells against SARS-CoV-infected THP-1 target cells (87.5%), compared with that against uninfected target cells (21.9%). Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV infection of THP-1 cells promotes the cytotoxic effector function of Vg9Vd2 T cells.",

One of the traits of SARS is the rapid development of lymphopenia, with CD4 + T cells being more severely reduced than CD8 + T cells during acute infection [10, 11] . In recovering patients, peripheral ab T cell subsets are rapidly restored, suggesting that tissue sequestration may contribute to the decrease in lymphocyte counts during acute SARS. In addition, CD8 + ab T cell responses to SARS-CoV spike protein epitopes have been observed in patients who had recovered from SARS [12] . Indeed, certain HLA class I molecules may direct the CD8 + T cell response, conferring either protection or increased susceptibility [13] . No Vb-specific changes were measured in our SC-HCWs \u223c3 months after the onset of disease, indicating that any oligoclonal ab T cell response that might have occurred did not persist in the peripheral blood in a form that was detectable by our MAb analysis.",

SAgs are proteins produced by certain bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses that stimulate a large number of T cells that express specific variable regions of the TCR b chains. In the present study, we analyzed the TCR Vb repertoire in the SC-HCWs, and no differences were observed in the frequencies of the different Vb chains or in the effector memory Vb T cell subsets in the peripheral blood of the SC-HCWs and the control subjects. Typically, any SAg response is expected to induce a significant perturbation of the Vb T cell repertoire, resulting in specific deletions or expansions of selected Vb T cell subsets. Therefore, in light of our data, the involvement of a Vb-specific SAg in the immunopathogenesis of SARS appears to be unlikely.",

The antiviral action of gd T cells may play an important defensive role, especially given their relatively large numbers (e.g., \u223c1 of 30 adult human PBMCs is a Vg9Vd2 T cell) and their ability to respond very quickly (typically, no antigen processing is required for the SAg-like activation of Vg9Vd2 T cells). The molecules recognized by gd T cells during viral infections are probably of cellular rather than viral origin and may be metabolites of altered cellular pathways [15] . Moreover, virusexposed gd T cells can be rapidly activated by type I IFNs (IFN-a and IFN-b) , a phenomenon that is likely to contribute to an effective antiviral response. Thus, the potential involvement of a possible gd-specific SAg in SARS-associated immune responses cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "The antiviral role played by gd T cells has been intensively studied in mice and was found to be correlated with the production of IFN-g by distinct gd T cell subsets [15] . In a rodent model of CoV infection (infection with mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]), T cells expressing the gd TCR appeared to be the major T cell effectors and were found predominantly in areas of virus replication [3] . In MHV-infected mice, gd T cells may function by both lysing infected target cells and secreting proinflammatory cytokines and could be important for anti-MHV responses in vivo. In our experiments, we observed that Vg9Vd2 T cells are able to exert a potent cytolytic activity against SARS-CoV-infected target cells. The remarkable similarities of the NKG2D receptor between rodents and humans may support a role for NKG2D ligands in the recognition and killing of CoV-infected cells. In the present study, Vg9Vd2 T cells appeared to be able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro through an IFN-gdependent process. Recently, Dandekar et al. have shown that gd T cells mediate demyelination in mice infected with MHV (strain JHM), with IFN-g and NKG2D as the critical players in this process [4] . NKG2D is an activating, C-type lectin NK cell receptor that is recognized as a potent costimulator of the cytotoxic functions of human Vg9Vd2 T cells [16] . Our data do not exclude the possibility that NKG2D ligands may be involved in the recognition and killing of SARS-CoV-infected cells. Furthermore, our results are compatible with the idea that Vg9Vd2 T cells contribute to anti-SARS innate immune responses by employing both cytotoxic and noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms.",
