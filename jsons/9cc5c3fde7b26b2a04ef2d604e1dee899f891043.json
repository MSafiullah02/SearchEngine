Necropsy from all children who died showed 9 (60%) had ARDS pattern and necrotizing pneumonitis, diffuse hemorrhage and interstitial pneumonia (n=4 each, 27%) with gram positive organisms consistent with severe viral and bacterial co-infection. Conclusions Hypoxia, ARDS and use of corticosteroids in children with ARDS who were mechanically ventilated were the factors associated with increased odds of mortality. Necropsy also suggested bacterial co-infection as a risk factor.",

Of these, 2487 (20%) were confirmed to have 2009 H1N1 infection and 714 (28.7%) were in the 0-12 y age group. The authors evaluated the risk factors associated with mortality in their setting and found that lower admission O 2 saturation, corticosteroid treatment in children with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, diffuse alveolar infiltrate and presence of ARDS was associated with increased mortality in children with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. In addition, the authors found a trend towards late presentation to the hospital and bacterial coinfection also being associated with increased risk of mortality (though these were not statistically significant). The present case series of hospitalized children with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection during the H1N1 India pandemic depicts the severity of illness seen in hospitalized young children. H1N1 infection caused significant pneumonia and ARDS, and resulted in ICU admissions and deaths in 96% and 16% of children, respectively. The reported influenza-like presentations such as fever, cough, sore throat, and myalgia as well as gastrointestinal symptoms in the present setting was comparable to previous reports of H1N1 in children [10] [11] [12] . Neurological symptoms and complications such as, altered mentation and seizures along with influenza like symptoms were also noted in the present study and were similar to what has been previously reported [12] .",
