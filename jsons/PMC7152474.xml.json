Increasing antibody titers and symptomatic improvement during the second and third week are associated with a decrease in SARS CoV viral loads.60, 76 Paradoxically, despite a fall in viral load and a rise in SARS-specific antibodies, clinical deterioration is observed in some patients.60 The host immune responses likely contribute to clinical deterioration in these patients. Elevated levels of IFN\u03b3, inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-12; neutrophil chemokine IL-8; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; and IFN\u03b3-inducible protein-10 have been detected, with levels of IL-6 correlating with severity of disease.77, 78\n",

Recommendations to reduce the likelihood of transmission include regulation of camel movement, enforcing the use of personal protective precautions while handling camels, and educating the public about the risks of consuming unpasteurized camel milk and urine.156 Given the challenges of following these recommendations, it is likely that sporadic transmission will continue until an effective MERS CoV vaccine is found.28, 157\nKey Points: Epidemiology, Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) InfectionsEpidemiology\n\u2022Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E and OC43 (identified in the 1960s) and NL63 and HKU1 (identified in 2004) are found worldwide. Exposure is common in early childhood; in temperate climates, it primarily causes infections in the winter and spring months.\u2022Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) was identified in 2003 as responsible for the 2002\u20132003 global outbreak of SARS.\u2022SARS CoV has not been associated with disease since 2004, and the possibility or probability of a large-scale re-emergence of SARS is unknown.\u2022Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) was identified in 2012 as responsible for an epidemic of respiratory illness in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Transmission is ongoing and is primarily limited to countries in the Middle East.\u2022Risk factors include exposure to camels or camel products or close contact with persons infected with MERS CoV.\u2022The most common modes of transmission are through droplet and direct and indirect contact.\nClinical Manifestations\n\u2022HCoV strains 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are associated with the common cold, acute otitis media, asthma exacerbations, and less frequently, bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\u2022HCoV-NL63 is also associated with croup. HCoV-HKU1 is associated with vomiting and diarrhea and frequently with respiratory tract symptoms; it appears to be associated more frequently with febrile seizures compared with other HCoVs.\u2022SARS CoV causes SARS, with an attendant mortality rate of 10%, which primarily affects adults and adolescents. Children younger than 12 years of age who develop SARS typically have less severe manifestations (i.e., fever, cough, and rhinorrhea).\u2022MERS CoV is associated with a spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe respiratory disease with an associated mortality rate of 36%.\u2022MERS CoV primarily affects male adults with comorbidities; children with MERS typically have milder symptoms.\nDiagnosis\n\u2022Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens can be tested by HCoV real-time polymerase chain reaction.\u2022Stool samples frequently are positive for patients with SARS CoV and have been positive for some patients with MERS CoV and HCoV-HKU1 infection; antibody tests also are available for SARS CoV and MERS CoV infection.\u2022Serum samples may be positive for patients infected with SARS CoV and MERS CoV.\nTreatment\n\u2022Infections with HCoV strains 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 require supportive care.\u2022SARS CoV and MERS CoV infections have no definitive treatment recommendations because of a lack of controlled trials.\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n",
