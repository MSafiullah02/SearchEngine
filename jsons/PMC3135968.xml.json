CCL19 and CCL21 bind to CCR7 and recruit T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) to T cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues (Yoshie et al., 1997, Muller et al., 2003). CXCL12 binds to CXCR4 and attracts multiple immune cell types to lymph nodes and spleen, and along with CXCL13, drives the formation of germinal centers (Campbell et al., 2003, Allen et al., 2004). CXCL13 is made by stromal cells in B cell follicles, and recruits both B cells and follicular helper T cells to these compartments by acting through its cognate receptor, CXCR5 (Forster et al., 1996, Legler et al., 1998, Ansel et al., 2000, Moser et al., 2002, Muller et al., 2003). The expression of all lymphoid chemokines in both T and B cell areas of lymphoid organs depends on lymphotoxin (LT) \u03b11\u03b22 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling in stromal cells that are a main source of these chemoattractants (Mackay and Browning, 1998, Ngo et al., 1999, Fu and Chaplin, 1999).",

            "text": "Beyond their role in the development and maintenance of lymphoid tissues, the lymphoid chemokines have also been implicated in the perpetuation of tissue inflammation. During chronic inflammation of the synovium and salivary gland, ectopic structures resembling the T and B cell follicles of lymphoid organs have been observed (Hjelmstrom, 2001). Evidence supporting a role for lymphoid chemokines in this process of \u201clymphoid neogenesis\u201d derives in part from studies showing that transgenic expression of CCL21 or CXCL13 in organs such as the pancreas or thyroid gland is sufficient to cause leukocyte recruitment and the formation of lymphoid structures at these sites (Fan et al., 2000, Luther et al., 2000, Luther et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2002, Martin et al., 2004). CXCL13 is expressed in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid structures that develop in response to Helicobacter pylori infection (Mazzucchelli et al., 1999), and has also been found in B cell aggregates that develop in the inflamed meninges of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and humans with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) (Magliozzi et al., 2004, Magliozzi et al., 2007, Serafini et al., 2004, Aloisi et al., 2008). Such data have fueled interest in the role played by CXCL13 in local B cell recruitment during organ-specific infectious and autoimmune diseases (Lalor and Segal, 2010).",

            "text": "Intrathecal accumulation of B cells and immunoglobulins (Ig) is a prominent feature of many infectious and inflammatory disorders of the CNS, even when ectopic lymphoid follicles have not been convincingly identified. In humans, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CXCL13 are found not only in MS, but also in Lyme neuroborreliosis and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas (PCNSL) where the tumors are almost always of B cell origin (Krumbholz et al., 2006, Ljostad and Mygland, 2008, Fischer et al., 2009, Rupprecht et al., 2009, Sellebjerg et al., 2009). In many of these settings, the magnitude of CXCL13 elevation correlates directly with the number of B cells present in the CSF sample (Krumbholz et al., 2006), while successful treatment is associated with parallel declines of both CSF CXCL13 concentrations and CSF B cell numbers (Ljostad and Mygland, 2008, Fischer et al., 2009, Sellebjerg et al., 2009). Still, the relative contribution of CXCL13 to recruiting CXCR5+ B cells into the CNS versus the coordinating their localization and interactions inside the CNS remains unresolved. One study in EAE showed that treating mice with a LT\u03b2R-Ig fusion protein that blocked LT\u03b11\u03b22 signaling could prevent the induction of CXCL13 in the meninges and stop the formation of organized B cell follicles at that site, but did not affect overall meningeal B cell migration (Columba-Cabezas et al., 2006). Continued uncertainty regarding the role of CXCL13 in B cell recruitment to the inflamed CNS prompted us to more thoroughly investigate this question in two well-established animal models of neuroinflammation. Despite its induction in target tissues, we find that CXCL13 is dispensable for B cell recruitment to the CNS during both acute viral encephalitis and EAE, even though it may still be a therapeutic target in CNS autoimmune disease driven by CD4+ T cells.",

A minimum of 10,000 gated events were analyzed for each experimental sample. Results presented reflect either the percentages or the absolute numbers of cells collected from a minimum of three animals at each experimental time point.

Although CXCL12 was constitutively found in na\u00efve brain samples, it was not increased by infection (Fig. 1\nA). In contrast, CXCL13 levels rose steadily and were sustained in the brains of SV-infected mice over time compared to sham inoculated controls (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, CXCL9 also did not increase with infection (Fig. 1C), while CXCL10 levels rose quickly and then declined as peak brain inflammation developed (Fig. 1D).

Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA isolated from each group of pooled cells revealed that CXCL13 mRNA was found primarily in microglia and to a lesser degree in infiltrating myeloid cells with limited expression in the lymphoid population (Fig. 1E). When primary cultures of microglia and astrocytes were directly exposed to SV in vitro, microglia readily produced CXCL13 under these conditions, while astrocytes did not (Fig. 1F). Conversely, synthetic TLR ligands provoked modest CXCL13 production by astrocytes and SV triggered the release of other inflammatory mediators by these cells (data not shown). Thus, microglia are the main source of CXCL13 in the brain during SV encephalitis, with infiltrating myeloid cells contributing modest amounts as well. Furthermore, this microglial production may be the result of direct exposure to the virus rather than being triggered by the actions of another mediator.",

In contrast, spinal cord levels of CXCL13 rose coincident with the onset of clinical signs and remained elevated over time (Fig. 2B).

B cells can be identified in this parenchymal infiltrate by immunostaining (Tyor et al., 1989), and anti-viral antibodies act within the CNS to clear virus from infected neurons in a non-cytolytic manner (Levine et al., 1991, Griffin et al., 1997). Virus-specific antibody-secreting cells arise in the spleens of SV-infected mice before appearing in the brain (Tyor and Griffin, 1993). To further characterize CNS B cell infiltration during SV encephalitis, flow cytometry was used to investigate the expression of activation markers on peripheral B cells and to enumerate B cells within CNS MNC isolates derived from infected animals. These assays showed that a subset of both splenic and peripheral blood B cells become activated in the first 7 days after SV infection as evidenced by their increased expression of the activation marker, CD86 (Fig. 3\nA). This peripheral activation occurs coincident with escalating MNC infiltration of the brain (Fig. 3B). Phenotyping of the isolated brain MNC showed that B cells constitute a small but measurable fraction of the infiltrates (Fig. 3C and D). Prior studies of disease recovery have shown that while total B cell numbers decline in the CNS 3\u20134 weeks after SV infection (well beyond when infectious virus has been cleared from the brain), a small population is retained in the brain for many months thereafter and is highly enriched for those B cells producing anti-viral antibodies (Tyor et al., 1992, Griffin et al., 1997). The present data show that B cells traffic into the brain during acute SV encephalitis in parallel to rising tissue levels of CXCL13.",

At peak paralysis, immunostaining procedures showed that a few B cells could be found infiltrating spinal white matter (Fig. 4\nB), and flow cytometry demonstrated that B cells could be enumerated in spinal cord MNC samples pooled from multiple animals (Fig. 4D). Together, these data show that in a model where the local humoral immune response directly influences acute disease outcome (viral clearance), CNS-infiltrating B cells are found in moderate numbers. In a model where CD4+ T cells drive disease symptoms (paralysis), small numbers of B cells still traffic to the principal site of inflammation. In both cases, B cell influx into the CNS occurs in parallel to rising tissue levels of CXCL13.",

Likewise, equivalent numbers of B cells were found in the spinal cords of both hosts at peak EAE when quantified in tissue sections and enumerated in pooled tissue MNC isolates by flow cytometry (Fig. 4C and D).

During active immunization EAE, the effects of CXCL13 deficiency were more apparent. Prior studies showed that the timing of both disease onset and peak disease severity was similar between wild type and knockout hosts, although peak severity itself was slightly lower in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 animals (Bagaeva et al., 2006). More notably, however, CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated an accelerated and more complete clinical recovery following MOG immunization compared to control mice where neurological deficits often persisted for more than 30 days (Bagaeva et al., 2006). Thus, disease is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response, while its course is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology.",

Consistent with their capacity to clear virus normally from the CNS (Fig. 5), CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice mounted an early serum neutralizing antibody response equivalent to that measured in CXCL13+/+ hosts (Fig. 6\n). Only at a late disease stage, well after infectious virus had been fully cleared from the CNS (Fig. 5), did the systemic anti-viral antibody response wane slightly, but not significantly, in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to CXCL13+/+ controls (Fig. 6).

When MOG-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were quantified among peripheral lymphocytes from CXCL13+/+ and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice following the induction of EAE, both subsets of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells were found in equivalent numbers at peak disease (Fig. 7\nA). Cells making two other T cell-derived cytokines, IL-2 and GM-CSF, in response to MOG peptide were likewise found at equivalent rates in these two hosts (Fig. 7A). This indicates that CXCL13 does not influence T cell priming or differentiation in response to a myelin autoantigen. However, the frequencies of T cells making each of these four cytokines were significantly lower in the CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice 2 weeks after peak disease was reached (Fig. 7B). These waning pathogenic Th1 and Th17 responses in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice correspond with the known propensity of these animals to undergo accelerated and more complete EAE remission compared to control mice (Bagaeva et al., 2006). Further evidence supporting a primary role for CXCL13 in maintaining rather than generating pathogenic T cell responses comes from adoptive transfer studies where wild type, Th1-polarized, MOG-primed T cells caused a milder and more self-limited disease when introduced into CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 compared to CXCL13+/+ mice (Bagaeva et al., 2006). Thus, in contrast to the anti-SV antibody response that develops and is sufficiently maintained in the absence of CXCL13, the pathogenic CD4+ T cell response elicited during EAE requires CXCL13 to be sustained long term after its initial priming.",

Thus, while CXCL13 levels increase at the main sites of inflammation during both disorders (Fig. 1, Fig. 2B), its absence has no impact on either peripheral or CNS humoral responses during an infection model whose recovery depends primarily on this arm of the immune system (Fig. 4, Fig. 6). Conversely, CXCL13 acts to sustain pathogenic immunity (Fig. 7), as well as tissue inflammation and disease symptoms in a model where CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology (Bagaeva et al., 2006). Taken together, these data suggest that CXCL13 plays a rather limited role in the development of neuroinflammation, but may instead be relatively more important in the maintenance of immune responses within the CNS.",

While CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be the main effectors of immune surveillance in the normal CNS (Ransohoff et al., 2003), B cells also contribute to this process. Studies in patients receiving B cell-depleting immunotherapies for the treatment of systemic autoimmune disorders or hematopoietic malignancies have shown them to be at increased risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a lethal encephalitis caused by the polyomavirus, JC virus (Carson et al., 2009, Gea-Banacloche, 2010). In this setting, the systemic depletion of virus-specific B cells likely disrupts their ongoing recirculation through the brain where latent JC virus resides, thereby reducing the host\u2019s capacity to keep the pathogen in check and augmenting the risk of viral recrudescence. The molecular determinants through which B cells provide normal immune surveillance of the CNS remain unknown, and may or may not involve a chemokine-directed recruitment process.",

In human disease settings, convincing evidence of early B cell recruitment and clonal expansion within the intrathecal space is provided by the detection of oligoclonal populations of IgG molecules (oligoclonal bands) and high IgG:albumin ratios (IgG index) in CSF samples obtained via lumbar puncture. During infection, these humoral responses presumably target the invading pathogen. In disorders such as MS, their frequent identification has long been interpreted as evidence supporting an immune-mediated basis of the disease. A role for B cells in the pathogenesis of MS is highlighted by the clinical benefit of therapies that block adhesion receptors mediating lymphocyte passage across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) or that deplete systemic B cells (Polman et al., 2006, Hauser et al., 2008). These findings naturally raise questions as to the molecular signals that recruit B cells into the inflamed CNS, and our data would suggest that recruitment molecules other than CXCL13 are involved.",

The B cells producing these antibodies are first detected in the spleens of infected animals before appearing in the brain (Tyor and Griffin, 1993), although their need to physically traverse the BBB in order for antibodies to reach foci of infection is debatable. Indeed, prior studies have shown that the intravenous transfer of immune serum or monoclonal anti-viral antibodies is sufficient to promote viral clearance and recovery in SV-infected mice, provided that enough material is given (Stanley et al., 1986, Levine et al., 1991). In this disease setting, the influx of B cells into the CNS may be more important to establish a local population of anti-viral effectors that are retained at that site well after viral clearance has been achieved in order to prevent late viral recrudescence (Tyor et al., 1992, Griffin et al., 1997). By comparison to other viral encephalitis models, CXCL13 was not induced in the CNS during experimental coronavirus encephalomyelitis despite prominent accumulation of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells in the target tissue (Tschen et al., 2006). Here, CXCL9 and CXCL10, both acting on plasmablasts through CXCR3, were implicated in CNS B cell recruitment (Tschen et al., 2006). Our data would suggest that neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10 are likely responsible for B cell recruitment to the CNS of SV-infected animals, since one mediator (CXCL9) is simply not induced by infection and the other (CXCL10) only goes up transiently and then declines as B cell influx begins in earnest (Fig. 1C and D). Ongoing studies aim to investigate the role of other chemokines in CNS B cell recruitment in the SV encephalitis model.",

            "text": "The precise role of B cells in EAE pathogenesis depends on the model under investigation. Early studies in C57BL/6 mice showed that genetic deficiency of B cells had no effect on chronic disease triggered by the MOG35\u201355 peptide, although B cell-deficient animals were resistant to EAE induced by the whole MOG protein (Hjelmstrom et al., 1998, Lyons et al., 1999). Germline deletion of B cells also had little effect on a relapsing EAE model (Dittel et al., 2000). More recently, however, very different effects on the clinical course of MOG-induced disease in C57BL/6 mice were observed when acute B cell depletion was undertaken at different intervals relative to disease initiation (Matsushita et al., 2008). These findings led to the conclusion that B cells exert reciprocal roles in EAE pathogenesis; sometimes serving an immunoregulatory function while at other times actually helping to prime MOG-specific CD4+ T cells (Matsushita et al., 2008). In both circumstances, however, these actions of B cells could readily occur outside the CNS and not require their passage across the BBB. Indeed, only in the more chronic phases of both EAE and MS are actual B cell aggregates found in the CNS, and then only in the meninges surrounding the parenchyma (Magliozzi et al., 2004, Magliozzi et al., 2007, Serafini et al., 2004, Aloisi et al., 2008). CXCL13 is present in these B cell aggregates (Magliozzi et al., 2004, Magliozzi et al., 2007, Serafini et al., 2004, Aloisi et al., 2008), so its primary role may be to help form ectopic lymphoid follicles rather than to actually recruit B cells into the CNS. The therapeutic benefit of disrupting these follicles via CXCL13 neutralization is unclear; in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type-1 diabetes, such an action prevented ectopic follicle formation in the pancreas but had no effect on diabetes progression (Henry and Kendall, 2010). The pathogenic significance of these lymphoid structures in experimental and human demyelinating disease awaits further study.",

            "text": "An important finding described here (Fig. 7) and elsewhere (Bagaeva et al., 2006) is that CXCL13 acts to sustain the pathogenic CD4+ T cell responses that drive EAE. How this happens remains poorly understood, although CXCL13 acts to position lymphocytes and DCs within T and B cell zones in lymphoid organs (Forster et al., 1996, Legler et al., 1998, Ansel et al., 2000), so it may serve a similar function within the CNS. One study suggested that CXCL13 could be an important effector that brings CD11c+ DCs and autoreactive CXCR5+ T cells together, increasing the likelihood of the cognate interactions that drive EAE (Bagaeva et al., 2006). Since CD11c+ DCs are an important source of CXCL13 in this disorder, and since most of the CXCR5+ cells found in CNS infiltrates are CD3+ T cells, the absence of CXCL13 may prevent sufficient numbers of myelin-specific T cells from reactivating to sustain disease beyond its initial stages (Bagaeva et al., 2006). This makes CXCL13 a potential therapeutic target in autoimmune demyelination of the CNS, but for reasons other than altered B cell recruitment into the target tissue. Further studies are required to clarify its role in EAE and related disorders.",

The disease course is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response for recovery, while it is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology. The data suggest that alternative molecular mechanisms driving CNS B cell recruitment need to be pursued if this process is to be better understood.",
