This study evaluated the impact of thoracic trauma and pulmonary failure on outcomes in trauma patients admitted to the intensive-care unit (ICU). Methods All trauma patients admitted to the ICU over an 8-year period were identified. Patients that died within 48 h of arrival were excluded. Patients were stratified by baseline characteristics, injury severity, development of ARDS, and infectious complications. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine variables significantly associated with the development of ARDS. Results 10,362 patients were identified. After exclusions, 4898 (50%) patients had chest injury and 4975 (50%) did not. 200 (2%) patients developed ARDS (3.6% of patients with chest injury and 0.5% of patients without chest injury). Patients with ARDS were more likely to have chest injury than those without ARDS (87% vs 49%, p < 0.001). However, of the patients without chest injury, the development of ARDS still led to a significant increase in mortality compared to those patients without ARDS (58% vs 5%, p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression found ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) to be the only independent predictor for the development of ARDS in ICU patients without chest injury. Conclusions ARDS development was more common in patients with thoracic trauma. Nevertheless, the development of ARDS in patients without chest injury was associated with a tenfold higher risk of death. The presence of VAP was found to be the only potentially preventable and treatable risk factor for the development of ARDS in ICU patients without chest injury.",

The Mid-South is a geographic area of approximately 30,000 square miles surrounding Memphis including western Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and small portions of Missouri and Kentucky. Charts were reviewed for data regarding patient demographics, injury mechanism, severity of injury and shock, infectious morbidity, timing of ARDS, and outcomes. These data were merged with the patient data from the trauma registry (NTRACS version 3.5, Digital Innovations) to compile the database for this study. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was recorded as a surrogate for infectious morbidity. All episodes of VAP were diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (\u2265 10 5 CFU/ml in the effluent).

The majority of patients were male (73%). These patients ranged in age from 13 to 100 years (mean 43 years), with a mean injury severity score (ISS) and Glasgow coma scale score (GCS) of 21 and 13, respectively. Chest injuries occurred in 4898 patients (50%) and 200 patients (2%) suffered ARDS. Overall mortality was 6.2%. Table 1 demonstrates a comparison of characteristics between patients with ARDS and those without ARDS. The groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and mechanism. However, patients with ARDS had a greater degree of shock on presentation compared to the patients without ARDS, as demonstrated by a larger RBC transfusion requirement (9 vs 5 units, p < 0.001) and both a lower admission systolic blood pressure (125 vs 133, p = 0.002) and base excess (\u2212 6.0 vs \u2212 3.7, p < 0.001).

This is much lower compared to the 7.3% seen in general ICU admissions [13] or the 12-25% of trauma patients reported by the previous studies [8, 14, 15] . Despite lower occurrence, the trauma patients who developed moderate-to-severe ARDS had a mortality of 40%, which is similar to what is reported by the other studies [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The reduction in ARDS occurrence may speak well for the improvement in patient management and prevention, but the unchanging mortality demonstrates that, rather, little advancement has been made in treating this condition. Trauma-associated ARDS has been shown to be different, both clinically and biologically, from that caused by the other clinical disorders [16] . Given this fact, there could be distinct forms of ARDS even within the post-traumatic population [3] . Multiple studies have revealed lower mortality rates in trauma patients [4, 16, 17] , but the mortality variation of ARDS within different trauma patients has yet to be examined in a large-sample population prior to this study.",

In 1999, Croce et al. evaluated 178 patients with post-traumatic ARDS and determined that there were two forms of pulmonary failure based on time to diagnosis [3] . The early ARDS (within 48 h after admission) was characterized by hemorrhagic shock with capillary leak. Late ARDS (> 48 h between admission and diagnosis) frequently followed pneumonia. Similar to the late ARDS group studied by Croce et al., mean time to diagnosis of ARDS was 6.2 days for those patients in the current study without chest injury. Furthermore, the development of VAP was also identified as an independent predictor of ARDS for this subgroup.",

Despite being less severely injured, patients without chest injury had significantly higher mortality compared to those patients with chest injury. As previously stated, VAP was found to be the only independent factor associated with the development of ARDS in patients without chest injury. However, the incidence of VAP in ARDS patients without chest injury was not significantly different from that of ARDS patients with chest injury (54% vs. 50%, p = 0.71), and, therefore, cannot account for the mortality difference between the two groups. These results suggest that VAP may play a role in the development of ARDS in trauma patients without thoracic injury, but it does not appear to be a contributor to the mortality difference between those ARDS patients with and without chest injury.",

Preventing the development of VAP in a critically injured patient is easier said than done. In 2005, the Institution for Healthcare Improvement introduced the concept of a ventilator bundle to improve the outcomes of mechanical ventilation and, thus, reduce VAP. The ventilator bundle consists of stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, headof-bed elevation, and daily sedation vacation with weaning assessment. However, in 2013, a prospective observational multi-institutional study found compliance with the ventilator bundle was not associated with VAP prevention. Nevertheless, over the last 2 decades, many advancements have been made in protocol-driven pathways for the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of VAP that may serve to limit further pulmonary complications such as ARDS [19] [20] [21] .",

This finding further reinforces that ARDS is a different entity in trauma patients without chest injury.

In addition, this allows only for associations to be made, and cannot account for all potential confounding differences. Furthermore, the data points are limited by what can be collected through available records. Data regarding specific treatments or detailed ventilator settings that could affect mortality were not examined. In addition, patients with thoracic trauma were defined as having a chest-AIS greater than or equal to 1. Including patients with lower chest-AIS values may potentially over-simplify the cohorts. However, we did not want to risk including any patients with thoracic trauma in the non-chest injury group. Therefore, we felt this to be the purest method. Finally, the development of ARDS was not separated into mild, moderate, and severe categories as defined by the Berlin definition [22] . Approximately half of the patients in the study were admitted prior to the publishing of the Berlin definition, when the American-European Consensus Conference criteria [23] were used for ARDS. The diagnosis coding in the trauma registry only allowed for the identification for the patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.",
