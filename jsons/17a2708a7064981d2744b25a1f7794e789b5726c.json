Coronary blood flow is determined by the patency of the coronaries, coronary perfusion pressure, and coronary vascular resistance. 2. The major determinants of myocardial O 2 demand are heart rate, inotropic state, and wall tension (which is the function of intracavitary pressure, radius and wall thickness, preload and afterload). 3. Critical O 2 delivery is the point at which the extraction ratio is maximized, and any further incongruence between demand and supply will lead to tissue hypoxia. 4. In the perioperative setting, continuation of longstanding beta blocker therapy is recommended. 5. Beta blockers should not be started on the day of surgery in beta blocker na\u00efve patients. 6 . Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing surgical coronary revascularization should be administered a beta blocker before surgery. 7. Although recent perioperative guidelines suggested continuing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) before non-cardiac surgery, adverse circulatory effects during anesthesia in patients chronically treated with ACE inhibitors/ARBs has led to the recommendation that these drugs be discontinued 24 h before surgery. 8.

Its main component is the central fibrous body, where the leaflets of all 4 cardiac valves converge.

It is located at the left ventricular outlet, separating the aorta and the ventricle. Owing to its central location, it is the only valve in the heart that is related to all 4 chambers and each of the valves. As a trileaflet semilunar valve, it consists of 3 cusps: the left and right coronary cusps giving rise to their respective coronary arteries, as well as the non-coronary cusp, which faces the interatrial septum. The right coronary cusp is the most anterior and is adjacent to the right ventricular outflow tract. The left coronary cusp is located posteriorly relative to the other 2. Histologically, its cusps are composed of dense collagenous plates, which are in continuity with the fibrous skeleton of the heart, covered by endocardium. Each cusp has its attachment to the aorta and the left ventricle. Immediately behind the cusps, the wall of the proximal ascending aorta bulges outward to form the aortic sinuses of Valsalva. The function of these sinuses is to prevent coronary ostial occlusion by creating eddy currents of blood flow during rapid ejection. As with the pulmonic valve, each cusp has a fibrous nodule at the midpoint of their free edges, forming the nodule of Arantius. The leaflets coapt via their crescentshaped surfaces. Incomplete coaptation of the valve leaflets during diastole results in aortic regurgitation, whereas limited systolic leaflet excursion due to excessive leaflet thickening resulting from degenerative or rheumatic disease process suggests the presence of aortic stenosis. The severity of aortic stenosis can be assessed by various methods. A peak transaortic velocity of greater than 4 m/second, a peak transaortic gradient of at least 70 mm Hg and a mean gradient of at least 40-50 mm Hg, as well as an aortic valve area of less than 1 cm 2 is consistent with severe aortic stenosis.",

Circus movement re-entry due to an anatomical or functional block is a major mechanism and the most commonly described. For a re-entrant circuit to occur, 2 roughly parallel conductive pathways must be connected with conductive tissue, capable of forming an electrical circuit. One of these pathways must have a refractory period substantially longer than that of the other pathway (pathway A). Finally, the pathway with the shorter refractory period (alternate pathway, pathway B) must conduct impulses more slowly than pathway A. Once an extra impulse (for example, premature contraction) encounters these 2 separate pathways of conduction when pathway A is unable to be depolarized due to being in the refractory period but pathway B is capable of depolarization, the impulse will be conducted via pathway B. The signal then travels to the distal end of pathway A to reconnect with it if it is no longer refractory, then it is conducted retrograde to the site where it reconnects with pathway B. Pathway B has a shorter refractory period and therefore it recovers faster: The impulse will travel into pathway B where it will reenter that portion of the circuit, completing the loop.

These responses are all blunted by receptor occupancy by beta antagonists. 5 Propranolol -Propranolol is a non-selective \u03b2(beta)-1 and \u03b2(beta)-2 receptor blocker with no alpha-receptor activity. As the most soluble beta blocker, its use is associated with the highest frequency of central nervous system side effects. It is well absorbed when taken by mouth. For a comparable effect, higher oral than intravenous doses are required due to its very high (90%) hepatic first-pass metabolism. Its active metabolite does not add to the primary clinical effect due to its short half-life. Propranolol decreases cardiac output by decreasing the heart rate and reducing myocardial contractility, effects that are especially prominent in sympathetically driven disease states. Owing to its \u03b2(beta)-2 receptor antagonism, propranolol may increase systemic vascular and coronary vascular resistance. Increased airway resistance may be evoked by propranolol in asthmatic patients. Renal and hepatic blood flow is reduced with the administration of propranolol. 5 Metoprolol -Metoprolol was the first \u03b2(beta)-1 selective receptor antagonist used in clinical practice to prevent increased chronotropy and inotropy in response to sympathetic stimulation. Its receptor selectivity is dose related. Metoprolol is lipid-soluble, it diffuses more readily into ischemic regions than hydrophilic drugs. Fifty percent of the drug administered is metabolized during first-pass hepatic metabolism. At the intravenous dose of 0.2 mg/kg, maximum beta receptor blockade is achieved. 5 Esmolol -Esmolol is a short-acting cardioselective agent metabolized rapidly by red blood cell esterases. It is primarily a \u03b2-1 blocking agent, producing significant decreases in heart rate and contractility. It lacks the ability to block peripheral vascular \u03b2-2 receptors, therefore decreases in blood pressure and cardiac index is more pronounced due to unopposed peripheral vasodilation. Esmolol has been safely used in patients with reactive airway disease. 5 Sotalol -Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic agent with both \u03b2-receptor and K + -channel antagonistic effects. A relatively recent Cochrane database review found significant reductions in incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in the cardiac surgical population.

After binding to carrier protein neurophysin, it is transported via the supraoptic hypophyseal tract to the posterior hypophysis, where it is stored and released into the circulation when plasma osmolality is higher than physiologic, or when profound hypovolemia is present. Normal plasma concentrations are less than 4 pg/ml. The half-life of endogenous vasopressin is 10-35 min, and it is metabolized via renal and hepatic pathways. Due to trypsin activity in the gastrointestinal tract it must be administered parenterally or intranasally. In concentrations higher than required for its antidiuretic effect, it acts as a non-adrenergic vasoconstrictor on peripheral vascular beds. It completely lacks beta-adrenergic effects; therefore, it produces less tachycardia compared to adrenergic agonists. In severe shock states, or in conditions where refractory vasoplegia is present, a deficiency in vasopressin levels may necessitate restoration of its physiological concentration by administration of low-dose exogenous vasopressin. The effects of vasopressin are mediated by a family of G-protein coupled vasopressin receptors. V 1a and V 1b are G q protein-linked, whereas V 2 is G s protein-linked receptors. V 1a is located primarily on the vascular smooth muscle of the systemic, coronary, splanchnic, and renal vessel bed, mediating pressor response by increasing peripheral vascular resistance. Intra-arterial infusion of vasopressin constricts all major celiac artery branches except the hepatic artery. A less well appreciated aspect is vasopressin's pulmonary vasodilatory effect by inducing constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increasing nitric oxide production. Vasopressin's vasodilatory effects are mediated by endothelial oxytocin receptors. V 1a is also expressed in diverse tissues such as hepatic, central neuronal, and myometrial tissues, as well as platelets. V 1a receptors are G q -protein linked, activate phospholipase C, and ultimately increase intracellular calcium, leading to vasoconstriction. V 1b receptors activate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the anterior pituitary gland. V 2 receptors are located primarily in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, and play a role in the homeostatic regulation of plasma volume and preservation of serum osmolality. These receptors are Gs-protein-linked, and activate adenylate cyclase to ultimately increase intracellular cAMP levels. This in turn leads to mobilization of aquaporin 2 channels and their insertion into the luminal surface of the collection tubules, and the subsequent increase of water reabsorption. V 2 receptors are also expressed in endothelial cells, where they are involved in the release of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (F VIII). VWF protects F VIII from breakdown, and plays an important role in binding platelets to the site of bleeding. 1. Hemodynamic effects: adrenergic-independent direct peripheral vasoconstriction via V 1a receptors without affecting chronotropy or inotropy.

PDE-3 is an enzyme that hydrolyses intracellular cAMP into its inactive metabolite. Inhibition of the cAMP-breakdown allows for the cAMP levels to remain elevated. This in turn increases the Ca 2+ influx into the myocardium, and increases Ca 2+ efflux from the vascular smooth muscle, an effect translating into increased inotropy in the heart, and vasodilation of the peripheral arteries and veins. In the myocardium, milrinone augments contractility, facilitates diastolic relaxation, enhances automaticity, and shortens AV-nodal conduction time.

Labetalol can be considered a peripheral vasodilator not triggering reflex tachycardia. In a dose-related fashion it decreases heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance, leaving the stroke volume and cardiac output unchanged. After oral administration labetalol is completely absorbed. Its significant first-pass metabolism produces inactive metabolites. 5 Phentolamine -Phentolamine is a reversible nonselective competitive antagonist at the adrenergic \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 receptors, as well as at serotonin receptors. Its main action is arterial vasodilation with minimal venodilation. SVR and PVR is therefore decreased. Heart rate and contractility drastically increases due to both the baroreceptor reflex and phentolamine's direct effect on central presynaptic \u03b1 2 receptors, allowing for increased norepinephrine release and decreased reuptake. This results in unopposed \u03b2 effects that may provoke arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, and respond well to \u03b2-blockers. In patients pre-treated with phentolamine, administration of epinephrine may result in hypotension due to unopposed \u03b2 2 effects. Phentolamine is a gastrointestinal stimulant, may lower blood glucose, and causes histamine release. It is used for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma (a drop in SBP >35 mm Hg and DBP >25 mm Hg is diagnostic for pheochromocytoma), management of hypertensive episodes associated with the resection of pheochromocytoma, as well as local treatment of skin necrosis associated with norepinephrine extravasation. 5 Phenoxybenzamine -Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective, noncompetitive adrenergic \u03b1 1 -and \u03b1 2antagonist at postganglionic synapses in smooth muscle and exocrine glands. Its main action is arterial vasodilation with minimal venodilation. It decreases SVR and PVR. Heart rate and contractility are increased due to both the baroreceptor reflex and phentolamine's direct effect on central presynaptic \u03b1 2 receptors, allowing for increased norepinephrine release and decreased reuptake. This results in unopposed \u03b2 effects that may provoke arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, and respond well to \u03b2-blockers. Phenoxybenzamine is available in PO form only. It is used for treatment of pheochromocytoma; it is started 10-14 days preoperatively to allow for expansion of blood volume. To avoid unopposed alpha-stimulation and life-threatening hypertensive episodes, \u03b2-blockers are not introduced until after adequate alpha-blockade.

Central \u03b1 2 receptor agonists may exacerbate depression and are contraindicated for management of hypertension in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 5 Clonidine -Clonidine is a centrally acting \u03b1-agonist with near selectivity on \u03b1 2 -receptors (220:1 \u03b1 2 to \u03b1 1 effect). As a partial agonist-antagonist, it elicits submaximal response on central pre-and post-junctional \u03b1 2 -receptors while blocking the effects of other agonists. It is a coronary vasodilator and acts as a sympatholytic-a property utilized to manage withdrawal symptoms in opioid and alcohol addicts. Clonidine effectively reduces SVR, PVR, and renal vascular resistance. Its half-life is 12 hours. 5 Clonidine blocks pain signal transmission in the brain. It may potentiate opioid effects on the central nervous system and has local anesthetic properties. When administered epidurally, it produces dose-dependent analgesia not reversed by opioid antagonists-an effect utilized in the treatment of cancer pain. It doubles the duration of intermediate-duration local anesthetics when used as adjunct to peripheral nerve blocks. Due to risk of hypotension and bradycardia, epidural clonidine is not recommended in the perioperative, obstetric, and postpartum setting. It causes sedation in a dosedependent manner. Due to lack of adequate data, it should not be administered above the C4 dermatome. 5 Clonidine should not be discontinued abruptly, as rebound hypertension is frequently triggered. Its immediate-release oral formulations should be discontinued within 4 hours before surgery and resumed as soon as possible in the early postoperative period. 5 Methyldopa -Methyldopa is a centrally acting antihypertensive. Its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. Its antihypertensive effects are most likely due to its metabolism to \u03b1-methyl-norepinephrine, which stimulates central inhibitory \u03b1-receptors and lowers blood pressure by false neurotransmission and possibly by reducing plasma renin activity. It has no direct effect on cardiac and renal function. Reversible thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, a positive Coombs test, and liver dysfunction including fatal liver necrosis has been reported with the use of methyldopa. Despite these adverse effect, methyldopa is still commonly used for the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension due to the lack of adverse effects of long-term treatment on the fetus. 5 Guanabenz -Guanabenz is an oral antihypertensive active on central \u03b1 2 -receptors. Its action is mediated by bulbar \u03b1 2 activation, leading to attenuated sympathetic outflow at the level of the brain stem. It effectively controls blood pressure without significant effects on renal function. It frequently causes sedation; therefore, additive sedative effects should be considered when used with other centrally acting depressants. Its abrupt discontinuation may rarely result in an increased production of endogenous catecholamines and subsequent rebound hypertension. In patients with coexisting liver and kidney disease, careful monitoring of blood pressure is recommended. 5 Guanfacine -Guanfacine is a selective oral central postsynaptic \u03b1 2A -receptor agonist with a duration of action longer than that of clonidine. It reduces sympathetic outflow and with resultant decrease in heart rate and vasomotor tone. Guanfacine preferentially binds postsynaptic \u03b1 2A -receptors in the prefrontal cortex, and modulates behavioral responses. Its immediate release form is used for management of hypertension, whereas its extended release form is used for treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder as monotherapy or as adjunct to central nervous system stimulants. Its dose should be reduced with concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors, and slowly increased with the use of CYP3A4 inducers. 5 Dexmedetomidine -Dexmedetomidine is a selective central \u03b1 2A and peripheral \u03b1 2B -agonist with sedative and anesthetic properties. Centrally, it reduces sympathetic outflow and inhibits norepinephrine release at regular doses. At high doses, it activates peripheral \u03b1 2B receptors with resultant vasoconstriction, increased SVR, PVR, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and central venous pressure. Its use is indicated for procedural sedation for awake fiberoptic intubation, as well as sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. Its initial loading dose is 1 mcg/kg over 10 min, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/hour, administered via a controlled infusion device, and titrated to effect. No dose adjustments are required in patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, dose reduction is recommended. It may cause episodes of hypotension, bradycardia, or sinus arrest. These adverse effects are enhanced in the presence of beta-blockers and antihypertensive agents, as well as in patients with advanced age, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing heart block, bradycardia, hypovolemia, or depressed ventricular function.

Upon entering the circulation, renin cleaves a decapeptide from plasma protein angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, precursor to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Angiotensin II (AT-II) is the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system. It is generated from angiotensin I by the proteolytic action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. AT-II is therefore a potent vasoconstrictor of arteries and veins. It is responsible for increased aldosterone secretion and sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Angiotensin II normally binds to the AT1 receptor that ultimately leads to the increased release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum to produce vasoconstriction. Besides its effects on vasomotor tone, AT II also mediates alveolar permeability and lung injury: excessive ACE inhibition is related to worse lung injury, an important consideration in the management of critically ill patients. Decreased generation of angiotensin II (for example, by inhibition of ACE) results in decreased vasoconstrictive effects, usually without eliciting reflex tachycardia or an increase in cardiac output. In addition, decreased concentrations of plasma aldosterone results in decreased sodium and water retention. ACE inhibitors block the AT-I to AT-II conversion, as well as the breakdown of bradykinin, an endogenous vasodilator substance, which contributes to the antihypertensive effects of these drugs. ACE inhibitors reduce activation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and decrease the concentrations of LDL cholesterol. If the concentration of LDL is already sufficiently low, ACE inhibitors may no longer be effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events.",

The properties of these antiarrhythmic agents have been discussed previously. This section will briefly review the role of beta blockers in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Beta adrenoceptor antagonists blunt the effect of sympathetic stimulation on the cardiovascular system. The magnitude of this effect depends on the density of receptors at the effector sites, and the availability and relative concentration of both the agonist catecholamines, and the antagonist receptor blockers. Beta blockers inhibit myocardial and peripheral vascular \u03b2 1 -receptors to reduce heart rate, contractility, and myocardial O 2 consumption. By decreasing heart rate, beta blockers increase diastolic filling time, and improve O 2 and substrate delivery to the left ventricle. By decreasing contractility, beta blockers reduce left ventricular ejection velocity and decrease shear forces on the aorta in the presence of dissection, and reduce dynamic ventricular outflow tract obstruction; for example, in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or the tetralogy of Fallot. SVR may increase due to inhibition of \u03b2 2 vasodilation; beta blockers should therefore be used with caution in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Beta blockers are generally not preferred as a first-line agent for initial management of hypertension, but may be considered as add-on therapy in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with other drug classes.

Nicardipine has no effects on the SA node and AV node. It produces clinically insignificant negative inotropy, and may be combined with a beta-blocker for the treatment of angina. This drug has the greatest vasodilating effects of all the CCBs, with vasodilation being particularly prominent in the coronary arteries. Because of all the antianginal drugs dihydropyridines produce the greatest peripheral vasodilation, either nifedipine or nicardipine may be useful in patients who have residual hypertension despite adequate beta-adrenergic blockade. Nicardipine produces dose-related decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Nicardipine is frequently used as a tocolytic. When administered, it binds to the inside of the myometrial L-channels causing them to remain closed, and inhibiting uterine contractions. Pulmonary edema has been reported when nicardipine was used as tocolytic. Its use is contraindicated in patients with severe aortic stenosis: A decrease in diastolic pressure may worsen myocardial oxygen balance. 5 Nimodipine -Nimodipine is a highly lipid-soluble analogue of nifedipine.

Hydralazine decreases systemic blood pressure (systolic less than diastolic).

Nitroprusside's degradation products are rapidly cleared via non-enzymatic pathways. Each SNP molecule releases 5 cyanide ions. Cyanide ions undergo sulfurilation by the hepatic and kidney enzyme rhodanase (also known as thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, indicating that thiosulfate must be available for the trans-sulfuration to take place) to form thiocyanate, and are excreted in the urine. Availability of thiosulfate is the rate-limiting step in cyanide detoxification. Excess cyanide ions immediately react with methemoglobin to form cyanmethemoglobin.

Thromboxane A 2 induces vasoconstriction and promotes platelet activation, whereas PGI 2 is a vasodilator with platelet inhibitor effects. In pulmonary arterial hypertension, their physiologic balance is shifted toward thromboxane A 2 . This promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation, vasoconstriction, and thrombogenesis. The activity of prostacyclin synthase is decreased in pulmonary hypertension, leading to low levels of the vasodilator and antiproliferative PGI 2 . Restoring the balance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, including the administration of prostacyclin analogues, is a mainstay of the medical management of pulmonary hypertension. 5 Epoprostenol -PGI 2 -analogue epoprostenol is used for the long-term treatment of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma spectrum diseases. It improves functional class, exercise tolerance, and hemodynamics. Its 2 main pharmacological actions are: (1) direct pulmonary and systemic vasodilation, and (2) platelet inhibition. It is an afterload reducer for both the left and the right ventricle. It produces dose-related decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance; it increases stroke volume and cardiac output. Epoprostenol is usually administered as a continuous infusion into a central vein. Dosing must be individualized; however, optimal dose range for long-term therapy is believed to be 25-40 ng/kg/minute, when used as monotherapy. Alternatively, it may be delivered as an inhaled aerosol, for example for the treatment of acute right ventricular failure in the intraoperative or early postoperative setting. Common side effects are headache, flushing, nausea, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain. Contraindications to its chronic use include congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, pulmonary edema during initial treatment, or known hypersensitivity to epoprostenol or structurally related agents. Abrupt withdrawal or sudden dose adjustments should be avoided. Its use should be limited to centers experienced with its administration and with systematic follow-up with patients. 5 Iloprost -Iloprost is a stable prostacyclin-analogue delivered as an inhaled aerosol to patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma spectrum diseases or appetite suppressants, or pulmonary hypertension related to chronic thromboembolic disease. In the acute setting, iloprost decreases pulmonary vascular resistance; with long-term use, in addition to its pulmonary vasodilator effects it suppresses pulmonary vascular smooth vessel proliferation. Iloprost is delivered as an inhaled aerosol. It is approved for functional class III and IV to relieve symptoms, enhance exercise tolerance, and diminish disease progression. Its adverse effects are similar to those of epoprostenol. Its use should be avoided in pre-existing hypotension. It may induce bronchospasm in patients with reactive airway disease. Caution should be used with its administration in the presence of increased risk of bleeding, anticoagulation, or other bleeding disorders.

Its main actions are pulmonary arterial vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. It is approved to decrease exercise-related symptoms and diminish clinical deterioration. Treprostinil may induce symptomatic hypotension. It may increase risk of bleeding. There appears to be an increased risk of Gram-negative bloodstream infections, especially in patients receiving intravenous treatment via a chronic indwelling catheter. Its side effects are similar to those of epoprostenol. Abrupt withdrawal or sudden dose adjustments should be avoided.

C. Etomidate is a lipid-soluble nonbarbiturate hypnotic and anesthetic without analgesic effects. It is a carboxylated imidazole, structurally unrelated to other intravenous anesthetics. It is frequently used for rapid intravenous induction of anesthesia at standard doses of 0.2-0.3 mg/kg. Its short duration of action is subsequent to its rapid redistribution to peripheral compartments. Etomidate causes minimal cardiorespiratory depression even in the presence of cardiac and pulmonary disease. It may increase heart rate and cardiac output by 3% to 4%, and may produce a 10-15% decrease in systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure. It decreases cerebral blood flow, CMRO 2 , and ICP. Even a single induction dose of etomidate suppresses cortisol production by inhibiting the activity of 11-\u03b2(beta)-hydroxylase. Etomidate causes pain on injection and it is associated with increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. There are no absolute contraindications to the use of etomidate as an induction agent. 7. A. Aortic stenosis, congenital or acquired, is the most common valvular disease in the United States. Most common etiologies are senile degeneration and congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Asymptomatic patients even with severe aortic stenosis carry a small risk of sudden cardiac death, whereas the occurrence of symptoms are ominous signs of poor outcome. The classic triad of symptomatic aortic stenosis are angina pectoris (life expectancy is about 5 years, unless the aortic valve is replaced), syncope (average life expectancy: 3-4 years), and congestive heart failure (average life expectancy: 1-2 years). Treatment is surgical. As the severity of the stenosis progresses, a pressure gradient develops between the left ventricle and the aorta, causing the left ventricular wall tension to increase (fixed increase in LV afterload). This leads to a compensatory increase in wall thickness. According to the law of Laplace, the wall tension within a sphere filled to any given pressure depends on the thickness of the sphere: Pressure = (2 * wall thickness * wall tension)/radius. Consequently, at a constant pressure, wall tension can be decreased by increasing the thickness of the sphere's wall: left ventricular wall tension = (LV pressure * radius)/2* LV wall thickness. Wall stress is a major determinant of myocardial O 2 demand. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an increasing wall thickness but unchanged chamber size therefore reduces wall stress and O 2 demand. Chamber size, contractility, and stroke volume are usually preserved until late in the disease process.",

            "text": "Extremes of heart rate are poorly tolerated in patients with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis. Maintenance of normal rate and sinus rhythm is essential, as a noncompliant left ventricle is unable to augment stroke volume to maintain cardiac output during bradycardic episodes to restore cardiac output, and excessive tachycardia will reduce coronary perfusion during diastole. Atrial contraction contributes up to 30% to 40% of the left ventricular filling, maintenance of sinus rhythm is essential, and any supraventricular arrhythmias should be aggressively treated. 8. B. Patients with concentric LVH and a hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis are unable to augment cardiac output in response to any sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Administration of an \u03b1 1 -adrenergic agent-for example, phenylephrine-improves coronary perfusion pressure without adding to the already existing fixed afterload, and increasing myocardial work. Concomitant venoconstriction increases venous return and augments preload. Reflex bradycardia may improve myocardial O 2 consumption. It is essential not to delay treatment of hypotension, as the thick myocardium is at risk for ischemia, further worsening cardiac output and coronary perfusion, leading to sudden death. Agents with the potential to increase heart rate or myocardial O2 consumption are not first choices for treatment of hypotension in this patient with severe aortic stenosis. 9. C. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent used for the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It is used during cardiac arrest to aid defibrillation of recurrent or refractory ventricular fibrillation. Amiodarone has Na + , K + , Ca 2+ \u2212 channel, as well as alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker properties. Its rate-dependent (rapid) administration may cause profound hypotension and bradycardia. Treatment is volume expansion, administration of vasoconstrictors and positive chronotropes, or temporary pacing. 10. B. Norepinephrine is an endogenous catecholamine with peripheral post-synaptic \u03b1 1 -and \u03b2 effects. Its peripheral \u03b1 effects predominate over its myocardial \u03b2 1 effects. The effects of norepinephrine mediated by \u03b2 2 -receptors are not clinically significant. Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor (MAP and SVR are increased) with mild positive inotropy. It does increase myocardial O2 requirements. Its \u03b2-induced positive chronotropy is counteracted by the reflex bradycardia resulting from the \u03b1-mediated increase in afterload. Norepinephrine does not significantly increase cardiac output; an effect different from that of phenylephrine (phenylephrine may decrease cardiac output). Norepinephrine is less likely to induce tachyarrhythmias than epinephrine, dobutamine, dopamine, or isoproterenol.",

The inferior wall (leads II, III, and aVF) is supplied by the right coronary artery in 80-90% of the cases, and by the left circumflex artery in the remaining 10%. A recognized immediate surgical complication of mitral valve surgery is left circumflex coronary injury, due to the proximity of the left circumflex artery to the mitral valve annulus: Any suture placed during mitral annuloplasty, or changes in coronary caliper as a result of a posterior leaflet plication may result in compromised blood supply to the lateral wall of the left ventricle. ST-segment elevations in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL indicate an extensive anterior myocardial infarct, and would most likely result from compromised flow through the left main coronary artery. 2. D.

            "text": "Choose the Most Appropriate Answer) 1. You are taking care of a patient undergoing mitral annular valvuloplasty for severe mitral regurgitation. Shortly after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, ST-segment elevations are noted in lead V5 with reciprocal ST-segment depression in lead II. The hypokinetic region of the left ventricle most likely reflects compromised flow through which coronary artery? A. Left anterior descending artery B. Left circumflex artery C. Left main stem D. Right coronary artery 2. Common ECG findings of hypercalcemia are: A. Slightly prolonged PR interval, shallow or biphasic T-waves, prominent U-waves, ST-segment depression B. Wide or flat P wave, prolonged PR interval, wide QRS, prolonged QT, peaked T-waves, ventricular fibrillation C. Prolonged QT c (lengthened ST segment), thirddegree AV-block, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia D. Short PR or QT interval (shortened ST segment),flattened T-wave, Osborn-waves 3. For a chronic beta blocker user patient with recent history of percutaneous myocardial revascularization with a bare metal stent 10 days prior to his nonemergent noncardiac surgery, the recommended course of action is: A. Continue beta blockers and proceed to surgery in 10 days. B. Wait at least 30 days after bare metal stent placement before undergoing non-emergent noncardiac surgery, continue beta blockers in the perioperative period.C. Wait at least 365 days after bare metal stent placement, hold beta blockers preoperatively. D. Start clonidine for perioperative cardiac risk reduction. 4. Through what mechanisms does propofol affect blood pressure? A. Propofol decreases systemic vascular resistance and directly depresses the myocardium in the absence of significant cardiovascular disease. B. At standard induction doses, propofol maintains baseline mean arterial pressure by augmenting inotropy in response to vasodilation. C. At high doses, propofol maintains baseline cardiac output by proportionally increasing the heart rate for a given decrease in SVR and mean arterial pressure. D. Propofol does not affect systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output. 5. Through what mechanisms does ketamine change blood pressure? A. Ketamine enhances cardiac output by directly stimulating the sympathetic nervous system; it causes tachycardia and acts as a vasoconstrictor by increasing peripheral arteriolar resistance. B. Ketamine augments myocardial contractility in patients with depleted sympathetic reserves. C. In patients with adequate myocardial and catecholamine reserve, ketamine decreases baseline mean arterial pressure as a result of vasodilation and myocardial depression. D. Ketamine does not have significant cardiovascular effects at standard induction doses. 6. Which statement about the hemodynamic effects of etomidate is correct? A. Etomidate causes significant cardiorespiratory depression in the presence of cardiac and pulmonary disease. B. Etomidate causes significant cardiorespiratory depression in the absence of cardiac and pulmonary disease. C. Etomidate may cause a small increase in heart rate and cardiac output, and may decrease systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure regardless of pre-existing cardiopulmonary reserves. D. Etomidate does not have any cardiovascular effects. 7. An 82-year-old patient presents for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His medical history is significant for severe aortic stenosis with an estimated orifice area of 1 cm 2 . The goals of induction are: A. Ensure full preload to maintain adequate left ventricular end diastolic pressure and forward stroke volume, maintain normal sinus rhythm, avoid extremes of heart rate, maintain adequate coronary perfusion by avoiding any significant drop in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance.",
