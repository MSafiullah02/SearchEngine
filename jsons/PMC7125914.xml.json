The clinical complications of atherosclerosis, for example, MI and stroke, are mainly caused by thrombus formation, which results from rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and exposure of tissue factor to the blood. An atherosclerotic plaque is formed when platelets adhere to subendothelial collagen. Tissue factor captures factor VII(a) from the circulation and initiates coagulation and fibrin formation to stabilize the primary platelet plug.9 The formed blood clot can then either locally occlude the blood vessel or embolize and occlude a narrower vessel downstream. In both cases this manifests itself in the clinical symptoms of MI or stroke. It is thought that intraplaque microvessels contribute to the unstable plaque phenotype and are mainly derived from the vasa vasorum by angiogenic sprouting, followed by ingrowth into the lesion.4, 10, 11 Recently, Rademakers et al. demonstrated that plaque-associated vasa vasorum were angiogenically active and, albeit poorly, perfused.7 Moreover, plaque-associated vasa vasorum showed increased permeability, reduced blood flow, and increased leukocyte adhesion and extravasation. These characteristics could contribute to plaque progression and destabilization. Imaging of plaque-angiogenesis could ascertain the exact importance of intraplaque angiogenesis in the prediction of plaque growth and rupture.",
