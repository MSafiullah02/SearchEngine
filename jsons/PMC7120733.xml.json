Low-valent vanadium is stabilized by strongly \u03c0-accepting ligands, carbon monoxide in particular, high valent vanadium by \u03c3 and \u03c0 donors represented by hard, oxygen and nitrogen functional ligands. Soft ligands such as thio-functional ones are predominantly found in vanadium compounds with vanadium in intermediate oxidation states. Vanadium nitrogenase is an example for a naturally occurring vanadium compound where vanadium switches in-between the oxidation states +II and +IV: In vanadium nitrogenase from nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter, vanadium \u2013 an integral constituent of the Fe7VS9\nM-cluster \u2013 is coordinated to three sulfides, a histidine-N, and two oxygen functions of homocitrate. Vanadium(III) coordinated to water molecules is present in the vanadocytes of sea squirts. The +IV and +V oxidation states, which are the by far predominating ones in physiologically relevant vanadium systems, typically contain the VIVO2+, VVO3+ or VVO2\n+ \u2018core\u2019, although there are exceptions. An example for a \u2018bare\u2019 vanadium(IV) complex is the naturally occurring amavadin, where V4+ is coordinated to two tetradentate N-oxyimino-2,2\u2032-dipropionate ligands. Amavadin is found in mushrooms belonging to the genus Amanita, such as the fly agaric. The oxidovanadium(V) core is present in vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases from, inter alia, marine algae, with vanadate H2VO4\u2212 coordinatively linked to an active center histidine-N.",

Whether or not vanadium is an essential element for evolutionary younger organisms, including vertebrates, remains to be verified. A functional role of simple vanadium compounds (vanadate in particular) in vertebrates, and hence also in humans, is likely, an assumption which is based on the similarity between vanadate and phosphate. In this context, the vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases are of particular interest since they mimic, or model, enzymes involved in phosphate metabolism, where the protein binding domain for phosphate is blocked by vanadate.",

These auspicious developments have also initiated research towards the design of biologically active vanadium complexes in the search of pharmacological control of cancer, cardiovascular imbalances, and diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, amoebae, and flagellate protozoan parasites. In several cases, ligands have been employed that relate to original pharmacologically applied drugs, with the aim to increase the efficacy of the drug, and to widen the spectrum of therapeutic use by exploiting the cooperative effect of the metal and the ligand. The research into these medicinal applications includes functional alternatives to the phosphate-vanadate antagonism, e.g., the direct interaction of the vanadium compound with the DNA of a tumor cell or the pathogen.",

The abundance of vanadium in the Earth\u2019s crust thus exceeds its occurrence in the Universe (\u22481 ppm) and in the Sun (\u2248 0.4 ppm) by about two orders of magnitude [1]. Volcanic areas with basaltic layers are particularly rich in vanadium, as are hard coal (up to 0.34%) and some oil shales and crude oil. Venezuelan crude oil can contain up to 0.12% V, mostly in the form of oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrins (Figure 1a). VO2+ ions are strongly complexed by porphyrins and related chelators, and the enrichment of crude oil with vanadium is due to its extraction from vanadium-bearing rock by porphyrins present in oil that had passed through rocky layers. Natural release of vanadium mainly goes back to weathering of vanadium-containing rock and the erosion of soil.\n\n",

The nanomolar concentration excludes the formation of vanadates of higher nuclearity otherwise typical for vanadates (see below). Vanadate concentrations in potable water are around 10 nM. In volcanic areas with basalt layers, the concentration of vanadium in underground water, and consequently also in drinking water, can rise to 2.5 \u03bcM [2]. Where drinking water is supplied through lead water pipe systems, vanadate is removed through the formation of deposits of sparingly soluble vanadinite, PbCl2\u22c53Pb3[VO4]2. A decrease of pH and an increase of the phosphate concentration (e.g., by addition of phosphate-based corrosion inhibitors to drinking water) can re-mobilize vanadate (eqns 1 and 2) and thus eventually increase vanadate concentrations beyond a tolerable level [3].\n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ PbC{l}_2\\cdot 3P{b}_3{\\left[V{O}_4\\right]}_2+12{\\mathrm{H}}^{+}\\rightleftharpoons 10P{b}^{2+}+6{\\mathrm{H}}_2V{O}_4^{-}+2C{l}^{-} $$\n\\end{document}PbCl2\u22c53Pb3[VO4]2+12H+\u21cc10Pb2++6H2VO4\u2212+2Cl\u2212\n2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ PbC{l}_2\\cdot 3P{b}_3{\\left[V{O}_4\\right]}_2+3 HP{O}_4^{2-}+{\\mathrm{H}}^{+}\\to PbC{l}_2\\cdot 3P{b}_3{\\left[P{O}_4\\right]}_2\\downarrow +2{\\mathrm{H}}_2V{O}_4^{-} $$\n\\end{document}PbCl2\u22c53Pb3[VO4]2+3HPO42\u2212+H+\u2192PbCl2\u22c53Pb3[PO4]2\u2193+2H2VO4\u2212\n",

In the slightly acidic to alkaline regime (ca. pH 5\u20139), these are predominantly divanadate [H2V2O7]2\u2013, cyclic tetravanadate [V4O12]4\u2013, and cyclic pentavanadate [V5O15]5\u2013. In the pH range 2.3\u20136.3, decavanadate [HnV10O28](6\u2013n)\u2013 (n = 3\u20130) comes in. For the structural formulae of these oligovanadates see Figure 5. Commonly, physiological vanadate concentrations at subtoxic levels are too low to allow for the formation of oligovanadates. Locally, however, concentration enhancement or template-directed nucleation [25] may occur, and the oligovanadate(s) then formed can interact with proteins and DNA. An example is the incorporation of tetravanadate into Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase [26a], and the promotion of the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bond in a phosphodiester RNA model by tetravanadate [26b]. Decavanadate is thermodynamically unstable at pH values exceeding 6.3; its decay into vanadates of lower nuclearity (including monovanadate) is, however, kinetically hampered, allowing for half-lives at pH 7, and even somewhat above pH 7, of several hours. Additional stabilization takes place by close interaction with proteins such as tubulins [27] and myosin [28] as well as with mitochondria [29]. Tubulins are proteins that assemble to structural elements (termed microtubules) of cytoskeletons. Myosin is involved in muscle contraction. Myosin binds decavanadate with high affinity, forming a myosin-MgATP-decavanadate complex that blocks the contractile cycle. Decavanadate that targets mitochondrial proteins inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Stabilization of decavanadate can also be achieved by its incorporation into tiny water pools of intracellular compartments \u2013 as suggested by model experiments with reverse micelles with nanoscopically confined water in the micelles\u2019 cavities [30].\n\n",

These values are based on the following structure parameters: r(O2\u2013) = 1.36 \u00c5, d(V-O) = 1.72 \u00c5, d(P-O) = 1.54 \u00c5; V-O and P-O distances for tetrahedral coordination geometry, where r(VV) = 0.36 and r(PV) = 0.17 \u00c5. From a geometrical point of view, the two anions are thus essentially indistinguishable, making vanadate an efficient competitor for phosphate in binding sites commonly targeted by phosphate. There are, however, also substantial differences: At pH \u2248 7 and physiological ionic strength, vanadate is almost exclusively present in the form of dihydrogenvanadate, H2VO4\u2212, while phosphate exists in approximately equal amounts of mono- and dihydrogenphosphate, HPO42 \u2212 and H2PO4\u2212. The higher average charge enables phosphate to interact more efficiently than vanadate with dipoles (such as water) and anions (e.g., anionic amino acid residues in protein matrices). On the other hand, phosphorus can attain the coordination number 5 in transitional states only, while the d-block element vanadium easily extends its coordination number by forming stable penta- and hexa-coordinate complexes. Hence, once incorporated in lieu of phosphate into the active site of a phosphate-dependent enzyme, this enzyme is commonly deactivated with respect to its original function.",

In the lower part of Figure 6, the mechanistic sequence of the phosphoester hydrolysis as catalyzed by phosphatases is illustrated. Apart from vanadate, many complexes of VIII, VIV, and VV with organic ligands that are related to or mimic physiologically available ligands, effectively inhibit phosphatases [35], likely after off-dissociation of all or part of the ligands and thus formation of vanadate or {VOxL} intermediates with an \u2018open\u2019 coordination site capable of interacting with, and thus blocking, the active site of the enzyme.\n\n",

Approximately 90% of all diabetic cases are ascribed to type 2 diabetes, the remaining 10% to type 1 diabetes [42a]. Type 1 diabetes (\u201cjuvenile diabetes\u201d) goes along with absent or only residual insulin supply by the \u03b2 cells in the Langerhans islets of the pancreas, commonly caused by degeneration of the \u03b2 cells in the frame of autoimmune reactions, or by accidental dysfunction or loss of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes (\u201cadult onset diabetes\u201d) is related, in its initial stage, to insufficient response of the cellular insulin receptors to insulin. In its advanced stage, a feed-back mechanism comes in, provoking \u03b2 cell failure caused by de-differentiation of the \u03b2 cells [43]. Type 2 diabetes typically concerns people beyond the age of 50; its onset can be kept in check by physical exercise and reasonable nutritional behavior. However, diabetes type 2 is nowadays increasingly diagnosed also with young people and even children; this juvenile onset type 2 diabetes appears to be correlated to obesity [42b].",

The C-chain is detached in the final step of insulin synthesis; in genuine insulin, the A- and B-chains are linked through two cystines. Insulin is stored as a C\n3-symmetric hexamer, with the monomers linked through histidines via zinc ions [44]. The discharge of the active, monomeric form of insulin is initiated by elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin targets the cellular insulin receptor, triggering a complex mechanism by which glucose becomes internalized into the cytosol, followed by glucose metabolism. Further, insulin is involved in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from smaller building blocks, for example amino acids), and in glycogenesis (the synthesis of glycogen). Insulin is thus strongly involved in glucose homeostasis. In addition, insulin stimulates lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis, and thus prevents ketoacidosis caused by the accumulation of ketonic bodies such as acetyl acetic acid in the blood. Ketonic bodies are causative for the severe disease patterns accompanied with progressive states of diabetes, such as retinopathy and dying off of limbs.",

A possible mechanism of action of antidiabetic vanadium compounds in stimulating cellular glucose uptake in the case of hyperglycemia is included in Figure 10. Accordingly, any vanadium compound {VOL} will be broken down in the extra- and/or intracellular space to generate vanadate. As noted in Section 3, vanadate is an efficient phosphatase inhibitor.

The inhibition of PTPase by coordination of vanadate to the active site cysteine, as well as oxidative inhibition (cysteine \u2192 cystine) by vanadium-induced production of peroxide, result in an up-regulation of protein kinase B (Akt). Akt plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from preformed ones), and thus in the prevention of, and recovery after, myocardial infarction. The up-regulation of Akt in turn enhances the expression of epithelial nitrogen oxide synthase (NO synthase) and thus the release of the vasodilator NO [63]. The maltolato complex 1a in Figure 9 [64], the pyridinethiolato complex 13, and the picolinato-bis(peroxido)vanadium(V) complex 14 in Figure 13 [65] perform significant cardio-protection in test animals (Table 3) [63\u201371].\n\n\n",

Anti-HIV activity has also been reported for the physiologically stable, water-soluble oxidovanadium(IV)-porphyrin 15 [68]. Water solubility of 15 is provided by the aminosulfonyl substituent at the porphyrin skeleton. The complex inhibits HIV-1 replication in virus infected Hut/CCR5 cells, possibly by targeting and deactivating the viral reverse transcriptase [Hut/CCR5 cells are derived from Hut78 cells, a human T cell line.

Transmission occurs mainly by the fecal-oral route and through direct contact. 90% of the infected people are asymptomatic. For the remaining 10% the symptoms include diarrhea and, in more serious cases, dysentery (an inflammatory disorder mainly of the colon) with mucus and blood, the latter stemming from amoebae that succeed to overcome the epithelium of the intestines and thus travel to other organs, the liver in particular, where they cause deadly abscesses.

Along with metallic vanadium, vanadium oxides (\u201cVOx\u201d) are in use as catalysts in oxidation reactions (an example is the production of sulfuric acid from SO2), as an UV-absorbing additive in glass ware, and in the form of lithium and silver vanadates in lithium batteries [80]. The first indication for the presence of vanadium in a living organism, i.e., the sugar beet, goes back to 1888 [81]; the essentiality of vanadium for some life forms became established in 1982/83 by the discovery of vanadate-dependent bromoperoxidase in the marine macro-alga Ascophyllum nodosum [82].",

Vanadate is an antagonist of phosphate \u2013 as demonstrated for the first time by Cantley in 1977 for the inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase, the sodium-potassium pump [84]. Based on the interference of vanadate with metabolic processes depending on phosphate in general, and on phosphate-regulated enzymatic activity in particular, vanadate has also been introduced into the amelioration of cardiac dysfunctions, and in fighting malignant tumors. The latter application, first investigated systematically by K\u00f6pf and K\u00f6pf-Maier [60], is based, at least in part, on the direct interaction of stable vanadium-ligand fragments with the DNA of cancer cells \u2013 and is thus reminiscent of the action of the well established anticancer drug cisplatin. Stable fragments in vanadium compounds are represented by the cyclopentadienide ligands in vanadocenes, and by N-functional, oligodentate aromatic ligands such as ortho-phenanthroline and derivatives thereof. Last but not least, yet another functional aspect of vanadium compounds is the ability of VO2+ to interfere \u2013 in a Fenton-like reaction \u2013 with the tissue concentrations of reactive oxygen species [85].AbbreviationsAbalbuminacacacetonylacetonate(1\u2013)Aktprotein kinaseATPaseadenosine triphosphate cleaving enzymeBEOVbis(ethylmaltolato)oxidovanadiumCAKIhuman renal carcinoma cell lineCCR5chemokine receptor of T lymphocytesCpcyclopentadienideCXCR-4chemokine receptor type 4FADflavin adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form)FADH2flavin adenine dinucleotide (reduced form)GLUTglucose transporterGSHglutathioneGSSGoxidized form of glutathioneHeLa cellscervical cancer cell line derived from Henrietta LacksHIVhuman immune deficiency virusIC5050% inhibitory concentration; the values denote the concentration of a drug or prodrug at which the life function of 50% of the viable cells are inhibitedIgimmunoglobulinIRinsulin receptorIRSinsulin receptor substratelmmlow molecular mass (ligand)MACmaximum allowable concentration at the working placeMICminimal inhibitory concentrationNADnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form)NADHnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form)NADPnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (oxidized form)NADPHnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form)PIKphosphatidyl-inositol kinasePKBprotein kinase BPTPaseprotein tyrosine phosphataseROSreactive oxygen speciesSARSsevere acute respiratory syndromeSTZstreptozotocinSVSimian virusTftransferrintscthiosemicarbazone\n",
