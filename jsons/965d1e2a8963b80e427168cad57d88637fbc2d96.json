The 29 institutions providing policies were relatively evenly distributed among the 4 U.S. geographic regions (range, 5 to 9 policies per region). Among the 26 unique policies analyzed, 3 (11.3%) were produced by state health departments. The most frequently cited triage criteria were benefit (25 policies [96.2%]), need (14 [53.8%]), age (13 [50.0%]), conservation of resources (10 [38.5%]), and lottery (9 [34.6%]). Twenty-one (80.8%) policies use scoring systems, and 20 of these (95.2%) use a version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Among the policies that specify the triage team's composition (23 [88.5%]), all require or recommend a physician member, 20 (87.0%) a nurse, 16 (69.6%) an ethicist, 8 (34.8%) a chaplain, and 8 (34.8%) a respiratory therapist. Thirteen (50.0% of all policies) require or recommend those making triage decisions not be involved in direct patient care, but only 2 (7.7%) require that their decisions be blinded to ethically irrelevant considerations.",

( We will subsequently refer to \"ventilators\" and \"mechanical ventilation\" for the sake of simplicity.) In general, health care is provided according to a conventional, wellestablished standard of care. When health care resources are severely strained, contingency standards of care, which modify usual practices but still aim at producing similar clinical outcomes, may be implemented. For example, health care providers may substitute or reuse scarce supplies. However, such changes may not be sufficient (4) . If demand is greater than the available resources, it becomes ethically justifiable to shift the focus from individual patients' preferences or best interests to saving the most lives possible (5) (6) (7) . It may, unfortunately, be necessary to withhold or withdraw mechanical ventilation from individuals who would otherwise benefit from its use. What criteria should be used to ethically allocate scarce resources, and what processes should be used to fairly implement allocation decisions are monumental questions facing many hospitals, health care systems, and governmental entities.",

For instance, some have argued for conserving resources: for example, sequentially allocating a ventilator to 2 people who are each likely to require it for 1 week to survive instead of to 1 person who is likely to require it for 2 weeks (8, 11) . Others have advocated for the principle of narrow social utility: prioritizing such groups as health care workers, whose efforts are in short supply and are necessary to save lives (9, 12) .

A fair distribution of potentially life-saving treatment requires that persons and communities be treated equally when they are equal in morally relevant ways. Hence, severity of illness and likelihood of benefit (e.g. prognosis with or without ventilator assistance) can be considered morally relevant features, while social or economic standing would not (policy 15). Transparency 20 (76.9) Transparency-the Plan developed here was developed with input from the community and efforts will be made to engage and educate our community about the Plan (policy 12). Transparent, public and explicit assumptions and reasoning about rationing decisions will give members of the community the opportunity to understand how and why difficult decisions are made and help engender trust in the institution (policy 15). Stewardship 16 (61.5) Duty to steward resources is the need to responsibly manage resources during periods of true scarcity (policy 11). Professionals enjoy great power and standing, and with this comes the responsibility to ensure that resources are used wisely and not squandered (policy 14). Duty to care 15 (57.7) Patients ineligible for scarce resources are still under a physician's care. Other treatments, including the basic provision of comfort care, that will optimize clinical outcomes should be provided for such patients (policy 1). [Institution Name] staff have a duty to care for our patients even in a time of pandemic (policy 5).

Duty to prevent unnecessary loss of life 12 (46.2) Limited resources at [Institution Name] will be allocated so as to maximize the number of lives saved (policy 2). Failure to plan for this at the institutional and governmental levels invited disorder, permits arbitrariness, risks bias and increased the likelihood that patients who would have survived with ventilator support will die because patients likely to die were using the machines (policy 14).",

The 2 most common criteria for making allocation decisions are clinical need and benefit, but outside this area of agreement, policies differ widely in the use of other criteria, such as age, conservation of resources, or giving preference to health care workers. Beyond ethical arguments for and against each of these criteria, the variation among policies is itself problematic, because it may result in injustice. For example, if different institutions within the same community use different criteria or prioritize criteria differently, an individual might unknowingly be admitted to a facility with a policy that is unfavorable to him or her. If policies are public, patients might select facilities on the basis of which policy is favorable to them rather than on which policy is fair or ethically sound. State or regional planning for disasters that affect large areas is thus important (5, 6) .",

Second, given the lack of a methodologically rigorous way to differentiate between health care systems and hospitals and to characterize systems, institutions were characterized by their primary hospital. Third, as a result of the difficulty in identifying state triage policies and comparing policies that may have been reformatted or adapted, it was not possible to determine institutional adherence to state recommendations. Finally, to speed the coding process, a relatively large number of individuals were involved in coding, which may produce inconsistency in results; however, potential inconsistencies were reduced by having 2 individuals code each policy and resolve any disagreements through consensus.",
