However, there is still a lack of effective, safe photosensitizers that would be well tolerated by patients. The combination of several methods (like phototherapy and hyperthermia) constitutes a modern therapeutic approach, which demands new materials based on components that are non-toxic without irradiation. Therefore, this study presents the synthesis and properties of novel, advanced nanomaterials in which the advantage features of the magnetic nanoparticles and photoactive compounds were combined. The primary purpose of this work was the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles coated with biocompatible and antitumor polysaccharide -levan, previously unknown from scientific literature, and the deposition of potent photosensitizer -zinc(II) phthalocyanine on their surface. In order to better characterize the nature of the coating covering the magnetic core, the atomic force microscope analysis, a contact angle measurement, and the mechanical properties of pure levan and its blend with zinc(II) phthalocyanine films were investigated. This magnetic nanomaterial revealed the ability to generate singlet oxygen upon exposure to light. Finally, preliminary toxicity of obtained nanoparticles was tested using the Microtox\u00ae test -with and without irradiation.",

The most studied photosensitizers for medical applications are porphyrinoids with zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) being an example [7] . ZnPc, although a 1 st generation photosensitizer, has been widely studied in PDT due to its high quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, low toxicity, and a strong absorbance in the red light region allowing for a deeper tissue permeability [8, 9] . Despite some success in the treatment of cancer, ZnPc reveals some limitations, most notably related to its hydrophobic nature.

A combined therapy, using photoactive compounds and non-toxic nanoparticles, can be considered as interesting modality aiming to meet this challenge. According to literature reports, the combination of PDT and magnetic hyperthermia is an effective approach and may enhance the therapeutic effect, therefore enabling significant tumor regression [15] [16] [17] .

Levan (Lev), a natural polysaccharide, is a promising material for use in pharmaceutical technology due to its outstanding physicochemical properties, like low viscosity, compatibility with salts and surfactants, and high loading capacity for water and chemicals [21, 22] . Furthermore, this type of fructan exhibits a strong antioxidant effect and offers protection against oxidative stress associated with atherosclerosis. In addition, it is biodegradable, non-toxic, and presents the ability to form adhesion bonds with various compounds due to a large number of hydroxyl groups in the structure. Lev (Fig.1 ) appears in several microorganisms and consists of glycosidic \u03b2-(2,6) major and \u03b2-(1,2) minor linkages. The isolated microbial levan has a molecular weight of less than 100 million Da [23, 24] . Interestingly, Lev was also studied as an antitumor agent [22] . In the literature, various polysaccharides coating magnetic nanoparticles have been so far described, such as chitosan, starch, dextran, and sodium alginate [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , but to our best knowledge, there have been no reports presenting the surface modification of magnetic nanoparticles with levan [30]. The size of nanomaterials was studied using TEM and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method. The properties of the nanoparticles were examined in terms of magnetization and the ability to produce singlet oxygen in an aqueous medium, which are necessary for the effectiveness of PDT-hyperthermia combined therapy. Finally, the preliminary toxicity of neat levan and all prepared nanoparticles were studied both under and without light irradiation using Microtox \u00ae test, which has been so far applied for the toxicity assessment of many porphyrazine and phthalocyanine photosensitizers [4, 31-34].",

To better understand the nature of the coating covering the magnetic core of the obtained nanoparticles, the AFM analysis, the contact angle measurement, and the mechanical properties of neat levan film and its combination with zinc (II) phthalocyanine were studied. The topographical atomic force microscope was used for morphological assessment of the samples and surfaces and allowed to obtain the topographic images and the roughness of scanned compounds. The AFM images of the Lev and Lev-ZnPc samples are shown in Fig. 9 . While the surface of both samples is rough, Lev-ZnPc is more so, as evidenced by the values of roughness parameters (Table 1) . Such rough topography may be advantageous for cell adhesion",

As can be seen, the contact angle for levan with the non-polar liquid is almost the same as the contact angle of the polar liquid, and the dispersion component (\u03b3 s d ) is higher than the polar component (\u03b3 s p ), indicating the hydrophobic nature of the sample. However, the contact angle for the levanzinc(II) phthalocyanine system is significantly smaller than for pure levan, which is indicative of the higher hydrophilicity of novel material. The mechanical properties of the samples are shown in Table 3 The formation of aggregates is a very common problem in photodynamic therapy, which 5 affects the efficiency of singlet oxygen generation. Therefore, the ability of prepared Lev- suspension was also tested. The test was performed for suspensions in conditions not exposed 57 to light and after irradiation with light at 665 nm of intensity 7.0 mW/cm 2 , which corresponds 58 to the clinically used doses in PDT. The results for suspensions at various concentrations of the materials are shown in Figure 11 . ",

It is worth noting that levan-coated magnetic nanoparticles (Lev-Fe 3 O 4 ) were obtained as a new magnetic material for the first time in the herein presented study. The Lev-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation of ferric and ferrous ions in the alkaline solution (pH=14). For Lev coating, the epichlorohydrin was selected as a crosslinking agent due to the hydroxyl groups present in levan molecules. Initial research indicated that the obtained levan-coated magnetic nanoparticles might become the basis of a new system for binary selective anticancer therapy. Next, the levan-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were combined with zinc(II) phthalocyanine (Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 ) to give a complex system. Due to the presence of zinc(II) phthalocyanine photosensitizer, the deposition of ZnPc on Lev-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles was carried out in the absence of light. The synthetic strategy for the preparation of the Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4nanoparticles is presented inFigure 2.

At the first stage of levan degradation, approximately 9% of the initial weight loss occurred between 20 and 115\u00b0C, due to the loss of moisture content. The main decomposition of Lev was observed between 190\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C, with 69% weight loss. It is probably caused by the breaking of the main chain linkages, as well as the breaking of bonds in the ring units. The first step in the decomposition of the zinc(II) phthalocyanine started in the range between 20-470\u00b0C and was associated with about 10% weight loss. The second stage related to the main decomposition of ZnPc appeared about 470\u00b0C. The 45% weight loss in this stage corresponds to the loss and fragmentation of the one unit present in the peripheral environment of the phthalocyanine molecule.

The obtained results indicated that the deposition of photosensitizer in levan layer increases the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and elongation compared with pure levan film. The Young's modulus of Lev-ZnPc composite is 25% greater than that of neat levan, the elongation is 61% greater, and the tensile strength is approximately doubled. According to X.Chen [54], the neat levan films revealed poor mechanical properties, with toughness lower than 2 MPa and elongation of 2.21%, due to a highly branched and compact structure of levan that prevented significant intermolecular entanglement. The addition of zinc (II) phthalocyanine to the levan layer had a positive effect on levan's mechanical properties. Therefore, despite the previously proposed application of such kind of hybrid material for anticancer PDT, it can also be applied for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. Especially in dentistry, it can be relevant to endodontic treatment, where temporary dressings are used to disinfect dentine tubules [57]. Another possible application of the hybrid material concerns pharmaceutical technology and the preparation of dressings for the treatment of skin lesions[58].",

The absorbance of the applied 20 28 quencher at 409 nm decreased almost to zero in the presence of the prepared magnetic 29 nanoparticles under irradiation. In comparison, the absorbance band at 670 nm remained 30 unchanged, thus indicating the photostability and effective mediation of singlet oxygen 31 generation by Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 . The singlet oxygen quantum yield of the reference ZnPc is 32 \u0278 \u0394 =0.56 [39]. The singlet oxygen quantum yield measured for the obtained nanomaterial is 33 \u0278 \u0394 =0.41, which is 71% the value obtained for the standard. The quantum yields vary in the 34 range of 0.3-0.8 for most photosensitizers, which means that the obtained value of \u0278 \u0394 is 35 relatively high. Moreover, the nature of the resulting Lev-ZnPc connection does not modify the 36 photodynamic reaction of the hybrid material, which explains its photosensitizing activity. In 37 addition, the obtained material combines the features of both the photosensitizer and the 38 nanomaterial intended for hyperthermia (see magnetization study)Fig. 10.

Currently, the cytotoxicity study on various 83 cancer cell lines is ongoing and will be the subject of subsequent scientific reports. summary, levan-coated magnetic nanoparticles and levan-coated magnetite 87 nanoparticles with zinc(II) phthalocyanine nanoparticleswere obtained, both 15 nm diameter 88 in size, and characterized with spectroscopic methods (ATR-FTIR) and electron microscopy 89 techniques (SEM, TEM, AFM). The diffractometric analysis (XRD) proved that the core of 90 the prepared material consists of pure magnetite. The thermogravimetric analysis of the Lev-91 ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles indicated that they are thermally stable at least up to 800\u00b0C as the 92 carbonaceous coating was created on their surface. Moreover, it was found that phthalocyanine 93 constitutes about 3%, and the levan layer about 21% of the nanoparticle mass.

M/H curves were recorded at a temperature of 298 K (T). 2.4.9. Specific surface area and pore size analysis Structural parameters like the specific surface area (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area S BET ) and pore structure of Lev, Lev-ZnPc, Lev-Fe 3 O 4, and Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 samples were examined using the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method. The relevant isotherms of all samples were measured at -196\u00b0C using an automatic adsorption instrument, ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics, USA). Before gas adsorption measurements, the materials were outgassed in a vacuum at 50\u00b0C for 8h. The pore size distribution (PSD) was derived from adsorption branches by the nonlocalized density functional theory (NLDFT) method. 2.4.10. Aggregation measurement The aggregation behavior study of the obtained Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were performed at different concentrations in DMF. Measurements of UV-Vis absorption were carried out on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The experiments were performed according to the literature procedures [36]. Singlet oxygen generation ability measurements of the obtained Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were performed at ambient temperature using DMF as a solvent, following the previously described procedure [37]. Mixtures of DPBF, which is a singlet oxygen chemical quencher (C=1.478\u00d710 -4 mol/dm 3 ), and the Lev-ZnPc-Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (C=4%) were exposed to light-emitting diode [38] (PrevaLED \u00ae Core G7 Food and Fashion LED modules OSRAM, Germany), emitting radiation at an absorption maximum of 615 nm, and changes in the UV/Vis spectra were studied. The intensity of the emitted radiation was equal to 0.21 \u00b5W/cm 2 and was measured with an electronic radiometer IL 1400A (Newburyport, USA). Zinc(II) phthalocyanine was used as a reference with the quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation according to literature data of 0.56 in DMF [39]. Measurements of UV-Vis absorption was carried out using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).2.5.2. Toxicity assessment under irradiationThe toxicity of the materials was evaluated by applying solutions or suspensions of the materials to Microtox \u00ae acute toxicity test -81.9% Screening Test, which was performed using Microtox \u00ae M500 equipment according to the protocols distributed by the producer (ModernWater plc)[40, 41]. Distilled water was used as the solvent for all the materials. Two sets of experiments were conducted: dark toxicity and light toxicity test. For assessment of light-related toxicity, an additional red-light diode (\u03bb max = 665 nm) was mounted above the Microtox \u00ae M500 cuvette incubator, which was used to irradiate the samples upon mixing with Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria.
