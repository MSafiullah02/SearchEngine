            "text": "Obesity has become a national epidemic within the United States that continues to rise at an alarming rate. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of obesity in the United States reached nearly 40% among adults or over 93 million people in 2015\u20132016 [1]. Although the relationship between obesity and chronic illness is well studied and understood [2\u20137], its relationship with acute illness and immediate post-trauma surgical complications is less clear. Given the rising prevalence of obesity, it is far more likely now that a significant proportion of the trauma population will be composed of individuals with an obese body mass index (BMI). To optimize care for obese trauma patients, particularly in those requiring surgical intervention, we must continue to enhance our understanding of obesity and its impact on outcomes in trauma.",

            "text": "To date, several studies have been conducted to investigate this relationship, but the results are inconsistent. Some studies suggest obesity may be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in trauma [8\u201315] whereas others have not demonstrated any such association [16\u201323]. However, a meta-analysis of these studies with nearly 7800 obese trauma patients found an association between obesity and higher risk of mortality and in-hospital complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [24]. Recent studies have observed a higher risk of mortality and in-hospital complications among severely obese and morbidly obese trauma patients [25, 26], suggesting outcomes in trauma may vary depending on the degree of obesity. While there have been multiple studies on general surgical populations purporting the increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and mortality with a laparotomy as well as with obesity independently [16, 27\u201329], fewer studies have specifically examined the association of obese trauma patients requiring trauma laparotomy. Furthermore, obesity is not currently considered among the patient-related risk factors for the development of PPCs [30]. One of the few available studies is a single-center study by Livingston et al. in which obesity was not shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality following trauma laparotomy [31]. However, higher rates of in-hospital complications such as pneumonia have been reported in obese trauma patients undergoing damage control laparotomy (DCL) [32] with higher mortality rates reported among the morbidly obese [33].",

A one-way ANOVA test was used along with a post-hoc tukey analysis to compare the overweight, obese, severely obese, and morbidly obese groups to patients with normal BMI. Categorical data were reported as percentages, and continuous data were reported as medians with interquartile range. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were PPCs including VAP, pneumonia, or ARDS.

A single-center study by Livingston et al. which examined about 1300 trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy found there was no difference in the rate of mortality regardless of BMI level [31]. In another single-center study, Haricharan et al. similarly found BMI did not contribute to the likelihood of mortality in trauma patients undergoing DCL [32]. In contrast, using a large national database with over eight thousand patients, we observed the likelihood of mortality to increase when BMI \u2265 40 kg/m2. Consistent with our study, a single-center study consisting of 104 trauma patients undergoing DCL by Duchesne et al. reported the likelihood of mortality to increase by nearly two-fold when BMI > 40 kg/m2 [33], suggesting obesity may be a predictive factor for mortality after trauma laparotomy at higher BMI levels. It is possible patients with higher BMI levels have a more complex and difficult post-injury hospital course, which then results in a higher likelihood for mortality. This is reflected in our patient population which had a higher LOS, ICU LOS, and median ventilator days as BMI increased. The morbidly obese also had higher rates of unplanned return to the operating room, decubitus ulcers, and infections such as superficial infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections and severe sepsis. This higher rate of complications likely adds to their higher likelihood of mortality.",

            "text": "The association between obesity and the development of PPCs after laparotomy is not definitively known. Several single-center studies have attempted to assess this relationship. One study found the likelihood of pneumonia and ARDS to be no different among obese trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy relative to normal BMI patients [31]. Another study found the likelihood of pneumonia to be higher in overweight and obese trauma patients undergoing DCL [32]. A final study found the likelihood of ARDS to be no different in obese trauma patients undergoing DCL [33]. In our study, the likelihood of PPCs was found to increase as BMI increased. One explanation for this discrepancy is the difference in powering of these studies as our study had nearly 8 times the patients of the aforementioned studies. It is well known that obesity may cause decreased chest wall compliance, decreased lung volumes, increased oxygen consumption, increased respiratory rate, mild hypoxemia, and increased airway resistance, all of which can predispose obese individuals to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome [38\u201341]. These changes in obese individuals also present with difficulties in airway management given the challenges to oxygenation and ventilation [39]. This is further exemplified in our data where morbidly obese patients had an increased rate of unplanned intubation as well. Interventions that have proven useful in obese patients during the postoperative phase include use of continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive ventilation [42\u201344] as well as incentive spirometry, targeted pulmonary toilet, respiratory physiotherapy, and early mobilization [42, 45, 46]. These interventions should be implemented for all obese trauma patients undergoing laparotomy.",

Additionally, given the retrospective nature of our work, our findings cannot be interpreted as causation and serve primarily to establish correlation and warrant further exploration. Furthermore, the use of BMI as a surrogate for estimating body fat and thus obesity may be an important limiting factor as well. Although BMI is widely accepted and is the most readily available tool for stratifying patients by weight, it is truly excess body fat rather than the excess weight that correlates with ill-health. Given that BMI is calculated based on just height and weight, it also fails to account for other factors like age, sex, muscularity, and ethnicity that play a role in determining a patient\u2019s body fat. The unstandardized fashion in which height and weight are collected across the country also serves as a limiting factor. While many trauma centers directly measure these values, other trauma centers rely on self-reported values or estimates. Furthermore, the diagnosis of pneumonia (especially non-ventilator related) is often made clinically rather than with quantitative cultures, resulting in a lower sensitivity and specificity. As a result, the true population of patients with pneumonia may not be fully captured. In addition, the TQIP database is limited to the index hospitalization thus long term and functional outcomes are absent. Additionally, pertinent data points unavailable within TQIP include whether the patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists class II or greater or had OSA, both of which have been identified as risk factors for the development of PPCs [30, 47]. There is also no information pertaining to how the laparotomy was performed within TQIP.",
