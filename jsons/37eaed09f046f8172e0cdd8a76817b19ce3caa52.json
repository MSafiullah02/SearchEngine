HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy or ART. If taken as prescribed, ART can reduce the viral load so that it becomes undetectable. If it stays undetectable, patients can live long, healthy lives and have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex, and more relevantly whilst being treated by a dental healthcare professional.",
