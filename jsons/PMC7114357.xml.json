            "text": "Diagnostic electron microscopy is a beneficial method for the diagnosis of infectious diseases (Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003, Curry et al., 2006). In particular, negative staining electron microscopy is used to visualize the causative agent of infectious diseases in certain clinical and environmental samples. The method is quick and involves the adsorption of particles in a suspension onto a particular support followed by staining with a heavy metal salt and drying. Transmission electron microscopy of such preparations allows a diagnosis to the group or family level based on morphological criteria without the need for any specific primers or antibodies that limit the diagnostic spectrum. Even viruses and bacteria that are not on the list for routine diagnostics or are genetically modified to avoid detection can therefore be identified within a few tens of minutes. The value of the method was recently demonstrated during the SARS epidemic where diagnostic electron microscopy gave the first indications that the causative virus was a member of the coronavirus family (WHO, 2003).",

However, negative staining electron microscopy is limited to small particles, depending on their density and the acceleration voltage of the electron microscope. Bacterial endospores, such as those of B. anthracis and related strains, are too dense to allow visualization of structural details other than size and form with negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 1\n), which prevents their reliable diagnosis. The safe detection or exclusion of relevant infectious agents is particularly of paramount importance in a bioterroristic scenario where environmental samples are collected.",

            "text": "The necessary structural information about samples of high density can be obtained by thin section electron microscopy. This method produces thin sections of a sample that are transparent enough for the electron beam, and visualizes the internal ultrastructure in the transmission electron microscope (see for an overview Bozzola and Russell, 1998). In the case of bacterial endospores, the particular structural signature, i.e. the complex coat structures that surround the dense membrane-bound spore core (Setlow, 2005), can provide an unequivocal diagnosis. However, a major drawback of this method is the comparatively long preparation time using standard protocols, which usually requires several days. Much effort has therefore been invested in reducing the processing time. For instance, increasing the curing temperature of resin polymerization reduces the processing time significantly (Doane et al., 1974) and the use of microwaves allows better heat distribution in the sample and could have non-thermal effects, which increases the rate of diffusion and/or the speed of chemical reactions (Kok and Boon, 1990, Leong and Sormunen, 1998). In all, the total processing time from native sample to a microscopic diagnosis can be reliably reduced to about 3\u20134 h (Giberson et al., 2003, Schr\u00f6der et al., 2006) or even less (Gove et al., 1990) using optimized methods. Most protocols use epoxy resin as an embedding medium, often in conjunction with osmium tetroxide post-fixation, which provides a good representation of the ultrastructure but usually does not preserve antigenicity sufficiently for on-section immunocytochemistry.",

Our strategy involved reducing the sample size and using the low-viscosity acrylic resin LR White (Newman et al., 1982), which efficiently reduced both the diffusion time during dehydration and infiltration with the resin. In addition, the polymerization speed of LR White was drastically increased by the use of a chemical accelerator (Newman and Hobot, 1987). These changes, together with an improved method for chemical fixation, reduced the total processing time for spores that have significant diffusion barriers (Driks, 1999) and are therefore difficult to process to about 2 h including diagnosis. The paper describes and evaluates the rapid LR White embedding protocol using bacterial endospores and other samples, including virus and cell cultures.",

Treatment with osmium tetroxide or uranyl acetate was omitted with both protocols. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Both embedding protocols, LR White and Epon, allowed ultrastructural details of the spores to be visualized with comparable quality (Fig. 2A, B). The spore core appeared round and the delimiting membrane was preserved. Outer and inner spore coats could be distinguished. However, the overall contrast was slightly lower in the LR White embedded samples than in Epon samples making differentiation of coat substructures difficult. To improve the visibility of structures and to reduce the staining time from 10\u201320 min to 1 min, LR White samples were stained with a mixture of uranyl acetate and methyl cellulose (compare Section 2.9 for details). This staining procedure resulted in a mixture of positive and negative contrast where membranes in particular appear negative (i.e. white) because of the surrounding stain (Fig. 2C, D). Using this very simple and quick on-section staining procedure, substructures of the spore coats became visible and the core membrane appeared to be better defined (Fig. 2C).",

Even the highest concentration of accelerator gave ultrastructural preservation that could not be distinguished from that found using lower concentrations of accelerator (Fig. 2 C, D). Concentrations above 5 \u03bcl accelerator per ml monomer were not useful for sample embedding because the resin gelled very quickly while the sample remained soft (not shown). Using 5 \u03bcl accelerator per ml resin, it was possible to complete dehydration, infiltration with resin monomer, embedding and polymerization within an hour. Together with sample preparation before embedding (not including fixation), ultramicrotomy, staining and microscopy an overall processing time of well below 2 h was achieved.",

In order to rule out the possibility that depolymerization of the formaldehyde by heat was incomplete, depolymerization by microwaves was compared with depolymerization by heat in one experiment. One beneficial effect of the microwave fixation might be the efficient depolymerization of formaldehyde polymers (Giberson and Elliott, 2001) that usually form in formaldehyde solutions (Griffiths, 1993).

Because of their inherent speed, microwave-assisted preparation protocols in particular have been developed and widely applied to diagnostic thin section electron microscopy (Kok and Boon, 1990, Leong and Sormunen, 1998, Giberson et al., 2003). In this paper we described a rapid and rather simple protocol using LR White as a resin that allows the diagnosis of bacterial endospores within 2 h. All the relevant details of spore ultrastructure (spore core and coats) could be distinguished, although it should be noted that the appearance of these structures was somewhat unconventional, as the particular on-section staining method used (Roth et al., 1990) gives a mixture of positive and negative contrast. However, providing the characteristic signature of bacterial endospores is preserved, unequivocal diagnosis is straightforward. This has been impressively demonstrated by the diagnosis of spores in mummies at least 1000 years old (Hino et al., 1982, Pabst et al., 2005).",

Nevertheless, already the embedding protocol takes 3 h 15 min, resulting in total processing times well over 4 h \u2014 too long for a first diagnosis needed to assess the risk posed by a sample. In some cases even the 2 h protocol presented in this paper may be too long. However, there is little room for further improving the processing time for thin section electron microscopy because the individual preparation steps have now been optimized to the point that handling times (changing solutions, transferring samples, ultramicrotomy) now contribute significantly to the time needed. Reducing dehydration, infiltration and microwave times may gain a few minutes and the polymerization times for the acrylic resins could also be reduced using microwaves alone (Giammara, 1993) or in combination with a chemical accelerator (Hillmer et al., 1991). In all, a further reduction of 15\u201320 min might be possible and this will be evaluated in the future.",

We initially used a high concentration of formaldehyde in conjunction with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde for at least 2 h at room temperature because this procedure not only results in acceptable structural preservation but also inactivates the spores (Gelderblom et al., 2007). In an attempt to reduce this time we tried microwave-assisted chemical fixation using the same fixative, resulting, after several trials, in a protocol involving 5 min pre-fixation at room temperature followed by heating to 50 \u00b0C for 10 min in the microwave oven. This protocol is very similar to that used by Schr\u00f6der et al. (2006) to process the various samples in their study although they used a modified Karnovsky fixative (1% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3) for 15 or 20 min at 50 \u00b0C in the same microwave oven. In contrast, studies with other samples have used microwave-assisted fixation times of a few minutes or even seconds (Gove et al., 1990, Giberson and Demaree, 1995, Login et al., 1995). In our study, however, shorter times for microwave-assisted fixation, with or without higher microwave power, failed to preserve spore ultrastructure, probably due to the unusual characteristics of spores (i.e coats and low water content) or even to the microwave oven used.",

Structural preservation was very similar to that seen with microwave-assisted fixation, with only the cores being slightly deformed. This procedure may be useful for the fixation of highly infectious species in a biosafety level 3 or 4 lab where the operation of particular microwave machines may be difficult because of space and safety restrictions. However, further studies should determine whether chemical fixation of bacterial endospores can be further optimized or not, for instance by modifying the temperature\u2013time course of the fixation or the composition of the fixative. Furthermore, sample inactivation is important for laboratory safety (Gelderblom et al., 2007) and must be assessed for any modified fixation protocol individually.",

This is in line with other studies which have showed that low concentration of the accelerator (i.e. 1 \u03bcl/ml of monomer) has no significant influence on the specific immunolabeling density but can result in an increase of unspecific labeling (Goping et al., 1992).

We therefore prepared samples other than bacterial endospores, including vegetative bacteria, mammalian cells, and both RNA and DNA viruses using the rapid LR White protocol. In every case, structural preservation was adequate for diagnosis of the pathogen group. Although these tests were done using the slower protocol (2.5 \u03bcl accelerator), the rapid protocol (5 \u03bcl accelerator) is probably universally useable because no significant differences in ultrastructural preservation between the rapid and slower methods were observed with both spores (this paper) and cells (unpublished data).",

The protocol will serve as the basis for further studies addressing the strain typing of endospores from environmental samples using morphological criteria alone or in conjunction with strain-specific antibodies. Strain-typing using antibodies is particularly attractive because sectioning exposes both external and internal antigens, increasing the number of potential targets for strain-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the new protocol described here should provide a much-needed improvement for the diagnosis of environmental samples in the practical setting.",
