            "text": "Wild aquatic birds in the orders Anseriformes (e.g. ducks, geese, swans) and Charadriiformes (e.g. gulls, terns, shorebirds) are traditionally considered as natural hosts for most avian influenza viruses (AIV) (Webster et al. 1992). Although AIV have been isolated from other wild bird species (Olsen et al. 2006), less attention has been devoted to species living in polar ecosystems. Arctic ecosystems are hypothesized to be a potential long-term source of strains conserved in cold waters (Ito et al. 1995; Zhang et al. 2006). However, in Antarctic and subantarctic areas, the situation remains largely unknown because of lack of studies. Millions of seabirds, penguins, etc. breed in very dense colonies in a few restricted areas in subantarctic islands and on the coast of the Antarctica continent, providing potentially ideal conditions for exchanges of pathogens (Gauthier-Clerc et al. 1999). However, these birds are not completely isolated from the surrounding continents and may be exposed to their pathogens. For example, brown skuas (Catharacta lonnbergi) and southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) that are breeding in Antarctica winter near the coasts of Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South America (Shirihai 2002); and Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) breeding in the Arctic winter near the coasts of Antarctica during the southern summer months, reaching well into the pack ice zone. Each year, waders, such as greenshank (Tringa nebularia) or curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) are vagrants to subantarctic islands and may carry pathogens from the Arctic (Gauthier-Clerc et al. 2002b; Frenot et al. 2005). The natural transhemispheric exchanges of pathogens have already been demonstrated for the Lyme disease spirochetes (Olsen et al. 1995). The introduction of avian influenza A to Antarctica or subantarctic islands from other continents is thus possible. The increases of human activities in these areas (e.g. scientific research, resources exploitation or tourism) are also threats for local wildlife populations through the introduction of pathogens and potential for exotic disease outbreaks (Gardner et al. 1997; Frenot et al. 2005). Antibodies to influenza A viruses have been detected in gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) from the Antarctic Peninsula (Baumeister et al. 2004). The origin of these viruses is unknown; either local circulation or introduction from other continents should be considered. In this study, we investigated the presence of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), one of the most numerous species in the Southern Ocean, in a colony located a few hundred metres from a French scientific station.",

One hundred king penguin chicks were sampled. Cloacal swabs were collected using the Viral Pack kit (Biomedics, S.L.) and kept at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction was performed. Extraction has been performed in France. Time between sample collection and extraction was 2 weeks. This delay was not a problem for virus detection because of the storage at \u221280\u00b0C.",

These highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were also responsible for high mortalities of the threatened bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) in the centre of China (Chen et al. 2005) and may challenge the conservation of specific bird populations (Gauthier-Clerc et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Long-term surveillance in Antarctica and the peri-Antarctic islands in the Southern Ocean has two complementary interests in the context of an increased presence of human populations in these areas. First, a public health interest, as most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (Taylor et al. 2001); the resident wildlife constituting a large and unknown reservoir from which new pathogens may ultimately be introduced in the human population, as for example for SARS and Ebola viruses (Chomel et al. 2007). Second, an interest in terms of biological conservation. Indeed, the Antarctic area is presently subjected to increasing human activities, and both human and wildlife might be under threat of new emerging infections diseases. Therefore, surveillance will increase the likelihood of detecting the introduction of exotic pathogens and potential outbreaks. Surveillance may also allow the detection of endemic or currently unknown pathogens in the Antarctic region that might be a threat to human public health.",
