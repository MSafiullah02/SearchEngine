Gray et al. found serologic evidence of acute infections with C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae among Somali refugees in a Djibouti refugee camp [3]. However, serologic assays with paired serum samples are by nature retrospective, not practical for rapid diagnosis, and less sensitive than molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays have been developed to identify atypical bacteria, but systems have not been developed that use qPCR to detect atypical pathogens for diagnostic or surveillance purposes in refugee settings. We determined the presence of atypical bacterial etiologies diagnosed by qPCR in patients from two refugee camps in Kenya. As these camps are part of a viral respiratory disease surveillance system, we also assessed the rate of atypical bacterial and viral co-infection in this population.",

Pediatric and adult patients whose illness met the case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were enrolled after informed consent was obtained from adults, older minors, and from guardians of all minors. Case definitions for ILI and SARI were adapted from the World Health Organization (Table 1) [4, 5]. The number of eligible ILI patients was limited to three per day for each camp; there was no limit to the number of SARI patients tested. As part of routine surveillance, nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were taken from ILI or SARI patients, and a brief questionnaire with information about demographics and clinical presentation was administered.\n",

Although patients with atypical bacteria only had significantly more symptoms than patients with atypical bacteria co-infected with viruses, a simple count of symptoms may not reflect severity of disease. Similarly, in a study of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized pediatric patients, Michelow et al. found children with bacterial and viral co-infections had the greatest degree of disease severity, although typical as well as atypical bacteria were included in this analysis [10]. In contrast, when we compared patients with multiple viral infections and single viral infections, illness category (ILI vs. SARI) did not differ significantly. The clinical significance of multiple respiratory viral infections has not been resolved in the literature; some studies suggest higher morbidity than single viral infections while others do not [9, 15\u201317].",

First, while we tested for eight viruses, we did not include some common viruses, such as coronaviruses, in our testing; we also did not test for zoonotic pathogens that may cause atypical pneumonias or other bacteria that typically cause community-acquired pneumonias. Second, our sampling technique included only NP and OP swabs. While OP swabs are the preferred specimens of choice to test for M. pneumoniae by PCR, nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasal washes are recommended to test for C. pneumoniae by PCR [18]; however, as our yield of C. pneumoniae was more than double that of M. pneumoniae, we feel that the NP swab was an adequate sampling technique for C. pneumoniae. In addition, the lack of a control group limits our interpretation of the positive results, as symptomless infection with either atypical bacteria or viruses is possible. Finally, the number of adults (n = 5) with atypical bacterial infection in this study was relatively small, accounting for just 4.4% of the patients, limiting generalizations primarily to the pediatric population.",

These findings may have implications for the choice of antimicrobial therapy when treating patients with clinical pneumonia in refugee camps in Kenya. Although routine testing for atypical agents is impractical in this setting, for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics or who are severely ill, covering for atypical pathogens may be warranted.",
