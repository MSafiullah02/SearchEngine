Materials standardized in this system have been found suitable for emergency medical practices confronting highly contagious diseases. Nevertheless, adhesion of blood, and body fluids from virus-infected patients to the surface of protective clothing still imposes a risk of pathogen transmission in the process of doffing, or undressing. We performed a small-scale experiment to test the possibility of infectious virus carryover on the surface of different fabrics used in commercially available protective gowns. Application of a lentivirus vector that expresses green fluorescent protein allowed easy monitoring of infectious viral loads on fabrics. Results indicate that fabrics of level-3 surgical gowns serve better to reduce virus transmission compared to fabrics of chemical protective clothing with the same or higher barrier efficiency. Analysis of sliding angles provided indexes of fluid repellency, which were inversely related to virus carryover potentials. Droplets of infectious body fluids may easily roll off fabrics with water-repellent finishing. Thus, virus carryover is a measurable risk factor to be considered for better choice of personal protective clothing.",

            "text": "Personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to guard healthcare workers (HCW) in emergency departments and in wards with highly contagious patients. Gowns and coveralls, as other components of PPE, are designed to prevent transmission of pathogens contained in the blood and body fluids of patients (1, 2) . Presently, PPE is classified by barrier efficiency that certifies protection from penetration of fluids, bacteria, and bacteriophage under defined pressures. However, selection of isolation gowns involves consideration of various attributes including classification standards, guidelines, and effectiveness (3) . As inferred from the Ebola and SARS outbreaks, availability in the facility, tolerance to distress in the protective gowns, and conditions of patients are also important issues (4) . In fact, overheating was found as a major concern in HCW who worked with PPE (5, 6). Importantly, the process of removing PPE has the highest risk of contact transfer of viruses from the PPE surface to the skin of HCW (4, 7, 8) . Many reports have highlighted careful instructions of removal procedures to HCW (6, 8) . Furthermore, application of repellent finish was thought to reduce the risk of body fluid carryover by the gowns (1) . In contrast to the emphasis given on barrier efficiency, which is categorized as levels 1-4 by standards such as ANSI/AAMI PB70 and ISO16603/16604, the impact of fluid repellency has been poorly documented. We designed a small-scale biological experiment to detect the infectious viral loads on the surfaces of commercially available PPE fabrics. In this challenging study, all experiments were conducted with priority for qualitative index, but not for \"evaluation\" or \"judgment\" on statistical analyses.",

A droplet (50 \u00b5L) of culture medium containing 10% serum was placed on the fabric (148 \u00d7 210 mm) fixed to a tilting stage (DMo-501SA, Kyowa, Japan). The stage was inclined (2 \u2022 /s) until the droplet began to slide, or roll off. Sliding angle was defined here as the stage angle at 0.5 s (1 \u2022 incline) before the droplet began to slide. The droplet volume required for measurement was determined be 50 \u00b5L using fabrics H and M.",

The entire cell counts did not differ significantly among the tested fabrics, H, J, V, M, and C, and were similar to the counts with the virus-containing 40 \u00b5L droplet (virus input) (Figure 2B) . A small fraction (1-2%) of the GFP-lentivirus in the droplet was transferred by fabrics H and J (Figure 2A) . Surprisingly, more efficient virus transfer (5-30%) was observed with V, M, and C. The virus-containing fluid was the most adhesive to fabric C with the strongest barrier efficiency ( Table 1) . These results suggest that virus carryover potentials increase in the order: H, J < M < V, C. We performed this experiment in quadruplicate and repeated three times to obtain comparable results. Fabric S, a soft polyethylene material, was easily crumpled and could not tolerate the virus recovery process. Alternatively, fabric S was directly submerged in the medium of HeLa cell culture after the virus attachment. Results obtained by this procedure were plotted in the S * column for reference only (Figure 2A) . The Hoechst-stained cell counts were decreased by \u223c10%, where a certain amount of virus transfer by fabric S was evident by the detection of GFP-positive cells.",

As a result, the virus infected cell number was not altered by the fabrics tested, confirming that the virus infection process was not affected by materials on the fabrics (Figure 3B) . In parallel, cells were cultured in the same medium without the virus, and were analyzed for ATP amounts. Cellular ATP production was not significantly altered (Figure 3A) , suggesting that the fabrics had no cytotoxic effect. Thus, the differences in GFP-lentivirus transfer among the fabrics (Figure 2A) were not caused by materials eluted from the fabrics.
