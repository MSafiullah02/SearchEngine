Such transporters control metabolic reactions by regulating throughput of substrates and products, and creating steady state pools of metabolites. Epithelial membrane transporters modulate metabolic flows and pools of both the proteinogenic and the nonproteinogenic amino acids. Working in conjunction with one another, amino acid transporters maintain coordination and integrity of metabolic events within tissues and even between organs.",

The chapter content is focused on transporters and transport systems that serve amino acids which are either nonproteinogenic or proteinogenic nutrients and metabolites, although some transporter genes and polypeptides are technically subsets categorized within larger groupings that are structurally and mechanistically related to the neurotransmitter transporters [1]. Also, many apparently unrelated so-called transporter \u201corphan\u201d genes have been historically clustered as a single branch off the SLC6 neurotransmitter superfamily, although they are now emerging as actually being epithelial amino acid transporters related in structure, function, and probably oligomeric association in the membrane [2, 3].",

For example, although PEPT1 is not normally expressed in colon, its expression is induced at the transcriptional level in pathological inflamed states of colonic epithelial cells in inflammatory bowel disorders such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease [28]. In this condition, bacterial metabolite dipeptides provide PEPT1 substrates absorbed intact into colonic cells and subsequently into the colonic lamina propria where immune cells reside [28]. Escherichia coli pathogenic peptide metabolites include Ac-muramyl-Ala-Glu and N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. This triggers an inflammatory response by induction of MHC I molecules and AP1 and NF\u03baB-related pathways leading to cytokines and macrophage infiltration. In the inflamed state, the sustained luminal acidic state further drives colonic transepithelial transport of the bacterial peptides. The distribution of PEPT1 in various regions along the gut is shown in Fig. 4.\n\n",

However, ACE2, which is a carboxypeptidase, was subsequently discovered in apical membranes in kidney [52] and intestine [53\u201355]. ACE2 fortuitously is recognized as a binding receptor by a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [56] (SARS-CoV), consistent with clinical observations that SARS-CoV causes severe gastrointestinal complications. A presumed intended biological function of ACE2 is proper trafficking and functioning of B0AT1, and then membrane removal of the C-terminal single neutral amino acid from nutrient peptides. These particular amino acid products of ACE2 hydrolysis are the very amino acids that are B0AT1 substrates [45]. A homologue of ACE2 found in kidney, collectrin, was shown to be a mediator of neutral amino acid transport activity and regulator of blood pressure [45, 57\u201359] via the transport interplay of arginine and neutral amino acids through cooperation of B0AT1 and the b0,+AT/rBAT transporters, as shown in Fig. 7. Collectrin knock out mice demonstrated reduced expression of apical membrane B0AT1, rBAT, and b0,+AT, as well as impaired intracellular trafficking of EAAC1, with the residual activity of B0AT1 attributable to ACE2. Broer\u2019s laboratory demonstrated that the R240 moiety of B0AT1 interacts with intestinal ACE2 permitting proper apical membrane trafficking and expression of this sodium-dependent amino acid transporter [45].",

Regulation of the transport systems can be manifested at many levels, including gene splicing and promoter regulation, interactions between requisite subunits of oligomers, thermodynamic electrochemical gradients contributed by ion exchangers, overlap of substrate specificity, selective tissue distribution, and specific spatial distribution of transporters leading to net vectorial flow of the amino acids. The next frontier for workers in this field is to uncover a comprehensive molecular understanding of the manner by which epithelial cells signal gene expression of transporters as triggered by substrates, hormones or other triggers, to further understand the trafficking and interactions among multimeric transport system proteins, to extend discoveries of novel small drug substrates for oral and ocular delivery, and to examine gene therapy or nanotherapy of diseases using small molecules delivered via amino acid transporters.",
