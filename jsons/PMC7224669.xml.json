The causative virus was officially named as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and its relevant infected disease was also officially designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) [2], [3]. As of March 11, 2020, COVID-19 had reached 115 countries, with 119 239 confirmed cases and 4287 deaths [4]. Currently, the major COVID-19 epidemic hotspots were brought under control in China [5], due to Chinese government\u2019s quickly effective response as well as vigorous public health measures. However, the number of COVID-19 cases outside China had increased drastically, with 143 affected countries, states, or territories reporting to WHO by March 16, 2020 [6]. Obviously, the situation of COVID-19 is towards controlling of a pandemic now [6], and study investigating risk factors for severe COVID-19 related outcomes including death is still needed [7].",

Admittedly, older age and diabetes were already reported to be significantly correlated with increased incidence, disease severity, as well as risk of mortality in COVID-19 [8], [9], [10], [11]. Besides, increased D-dimer, high N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and increased serum amyloid A were also reported to be risk factors for disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 [12], [13], [14]. As components of blood routine test available for almost all hospitalized patients, PBICs usually serve as practical markers in infectious disease. Indeed, leukocytosis, leukopenia, and lymphopenia have been reported to be commonly seen in COVID-19 patients [15]. However, the underlying changes of other peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs) in COVID-19 patients are little known, especially eosinophil level and lymphocyte subsets. Additionally, the risk factors for the underlying changes of these PBICs as well as their roles in COVID-19 patients\u2019 outcomes are not well addressed yet.",

Meanwhile, cytometric analysis of this patient showed that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were substantially reduced but with hyperactivated status in the peripheral blood [17]. Accordingly, the researchers proposed that the over-activation and high cytotoxicity of lymphocytes partly contributed to the severe immune injury in this patient [17]. Besides, lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) patients also showed that there were extensive cellular infiltrates in the interstitium and alveoli, with the neutrophils and macrophages being the predominant cell type [18]. Based on these background along with the decrease of multiple PBICs in COVID-19 patients, we hypothesized that neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes migrate from peripheral blood into the lung tissue, resulting in neutropenia, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia in peripheral blood, as well as acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients.",

Another study based on 1099 cases from 552 hospitals showed that lymphopenia and leukopenia were present in 83.2% and 33.7% of the patients on admission [20]. The other study enrolling 138 patients revealed that eosinopenia was seen in 60.7% of the severe patients (34/56), according to blood cell test results on the first day of admission. Meanwhile, this study also revealed that absolute numbers of circulating eosinophils and lymphocytes correlated positively with each other, especially for the second test during hospitalization [21]. Moreover, another study showed that the incidence rate of eosinopenia in COVID-19 was 70.0% (7/10), but the incidence rate in patients with other viral pneumonia is only 16.7% (5/30) [22], suggesting that COVID-19 patients are susceptible to eosinopenia.",

Additionally, the lymphopenia (median counts 0.42-0.67 x109/L) persisted in non-survivors as long as 25 days from illness onset, but the median lymphocyte counts increased from 1.08 x109/L to 1.43 x109/L in survivors [9].

Coincidently, this above logistic regression results were in line with those in our study, in which the situation of eosinopenia get improved during recovery phase and eosinopenia did not correlate with worse one-month outcome via multivariable logistic regression analysis. Interestingly, one more study based on ten COVID-19 patients was also identified, showing that counts of lymphocyte increased persistently after sustained lopinavir-combined regimen, and eosinophil counts were low on initial hospitalization, but all returned to normal before discharge [24].

One study based on 249 cases of mild type showed that 45.5% of COVID-19 patients suffered from decreased CD4+T cells counts, and 92.8% of the patients had normal CD4+T/CD8+T ratio [25]. Meanwhile, this study also revealed that CD4+T cell count (per 100 cells/\u03bcl increase) was independently associated with ICU admission (OR=0.55,95%:0.33-0.92, P=0.02) according to multivariate logistic regression [25]. In another study based on 44 patients, lymphocyte subsets analyzed results showed that the total number of B cells, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in the whole group, and this decrease became more evident in the cases of severe type when compared with non-severe type (743.6/uL vs 1020.1/uL; P =0.032) [19]. In more detail, T cells along with NK cells were below normal levels, but B cells were within normal range, with the situation becoming more worse in patients of severe type [19], which coincided with the results from the other study enrolling 37 COVID-19 cases according to blood sample before initial treatment [26]. Additionally, there was an increase of CD8+T cells and B cells in patients with clinical response, but there was no significant change of any lymphocyte subset detected in patients without clinical response [26]. These results are consistent with our results, regarding the total counts alteration of T cells, B cells, and NK cells in patients with different classifications. Differently, we retrospectively investigated the distribution of lymphocyte subsets (2 weeks after treatment rather than pretreatment) in patients with one-month outcome in COVID-19 patients and also analyzed its predicting role in one-month outcome (Recovery versus Un-discharged/died), which may useful in judging patients\u2019 prognosis.",

The frequency of multi-functional CD4+T cells (defined as positive at least two of these three molecules: interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-2) was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients of severe type than the healthy control and mild group. Meanwhile, the frequency of non-exhausted CD8+T cells (PD-1 negative, CTLA-4 negative, and TIGIT negative) significantly decreased when compared with the other two groups. However, the functional blockade of PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT will enhance CD8+T cells effector function, resulted in viral clearance [28]. Thus, it is assumed by this study that the functional damage of CD4+T cells makes COVID-19 patients susceptible to severe disease, and the excessive exhaustion of CD8+T cells impairs cellular immune response to 2019-nCoV in severe patients [27]. In consistent with this above standpoint, transplantation of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) negative mesenchymal stem cells (free from 2019-nCoV infection), has been reported to be safe and effective for treatments in COVID-19 patients [16].",

As a common cause of respiratory failure, ARDS is present in approximately 10% of all ICU patients worldwide [29]. ARDS is currently regarded as a response to various injuries all evolving through a number of different phases: alveolar and capillary damage to lung resolution with or without a fibro-proliferative phase [30]. In fact, there is emerging evidence showed that immune molecular regulation involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS, including neutrophil netosis, the pro-inflammatory response of Th17 subsets, and the anti-inflammatory and regenerative role of T regulatory cells subsets [31]. Besides, inflammatory responses are reported to have key effects on every phase of ARDS, and their cascades damage vascular endothelial barrier and increase vascular permeability [32]. Moreover, according to the surgical pathology of 5 patients diagnosed with swine-origin influenza type A (H1N1) and acute respiratory failure, macrophages, CD4+T helper cells, CD8+T cytotoxic cells, CD20+B cells, CD1a+ dendritic cells, S100+ dendritic cells, and NK cells were aggregated around vessels and bronchioles in all patients\u2019 specimens [33]. In line with this, another study based on 44 patients with alveolar damage showed that there was higher level of neutrophils and macrophages in small airways and parenchyma, but the H1N1 group suffered from higher percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD83+ dendritic cells, and NK cells in the lung parenchyma [34].",

In the process of ALI, lymphocytes have been reported to migrate to the lung, where they maintain, enhance, and regulate immune response [40]. According to pig model induced by swine influence H1N1 virus, higher frequencies of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, immunosuppressive T cells, activated T cells, dendritic cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found in the infected lungs [41]. Besides, one study showed that T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) strongly enriched and infiltrated the human airway during the onset of ARDS, and Tfr also regulated the development of B regulatory cells\n[42]\n. It is well known that NK cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system. As regulatory cells engaged in reciprocal interactions with T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, NK cells can be redundant during immune challenge, and they can exacerbate immune responses [43]. It is revealed that NK cells are sparse in lung tissue of fatal cases, and granzyme B-expressing NK cells are accumulated in the respiratory tracts of cases diagnosed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchitis [44]. Meanwhile, RSV infection can cause recruitment and activation of lung NK cells at early stage of infection, then activated NK cells became functional NK cells because they produce large amount of gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3), resulting in acute lung immune injury [45]. Moreover, NK cells could also promote neutrophils recruitment by accelerating the production of pulmonary chemokine CXC ligand (CXCL) 1 and CXXL2 during the lung injury [46].",

Additionally, some extra strengths were raised in our own study, when compared with previous results. First, we discovered that clinical classification-critically severe was the risk factor for eosinopenia, lymphopenia as well as one-month outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Second, we identified the alteration regularity of PBICs in COVID-19 patients during treatment, not only in recovery patients but also in aggravated patients. Third, severe COVID-19 patients suffered from weak cellular immunity, including reduced counts of T cells and NK cells. Importantly, it may be that the functional damage of CD4+T cells that makes COVID-19 patients susceptible to severe disease, and the excessive exhaustion of CD8+T cells that impairs cellular immune response to 2019-nCoV in severe patients according to the literature review [27]. Finally, we put forward that PBICs might serve as indicators of disease severity and signals of disease progression in COVID-19.",

The second issue is that the lymphocyte subsets was collected 2 weeks after treatment rather than the first day or within 7 days after admission. Third, the risk factors for neutropenia, neutrocytosis and monopenia were not thoroughly investigated in our study, since the neutrophils can be affected by too many other factors including other infection, and the lower limit for monocyte counts is zero according to normal range. Further more, the PBICs were not analyzed in the sputum of patients in our study, and the pathological findings of COVID-19 was based on only one case\u2019s autopsy. Moreover, the definations of acute phase, recovery phase and aggravated phase were raised by ourselves rather than explicit guideline. Finally, the alterations of PBICs except for leukocytes can also be caused by other confounding factors, such as severe infection, which were not described at length. Hence, clinical study with large scale and well-designed quality is still needed before using PBICs as diagnostics and prognostication in COVID-19 patients.",
