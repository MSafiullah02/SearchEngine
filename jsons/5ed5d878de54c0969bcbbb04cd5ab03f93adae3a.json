Most epidemiological studies fail to identify an etiologic agent i\u00f1 40% of diarrhea cases [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Recently, we conducted viral metagenomic analysis of diarrhea samples using a mass sequencing approach with the explicit goal of identifying novel viruses that may be candidate causes of diarrhea. One of the stool samples we analyzed was collected in 1999 at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia from a 3-yr old boy with acute diarrhea. Seven sequence reads were identified in this sample that shared \u2264 67% amino acid identity to known astrovirus proteins, suggesting that a novel astrovirus was present in the sample [20] . In this paper, we report the full sequencing and characterization of the genome of this astrovirus, referred to hereafter as astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1).",

In this study, the complete genome of the astrovirus present in the original stool specimen was sequenced to an average of >3\u00d7 coverage [GenBank: FJ222451]. The virus has been tentatively named Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1). Analysis of the genome showed that AstV-MLB1 has the same genomic organization as other astroviruses. Like other astroviruses, the AstV-MLB1 genome was predicted to encode three open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2) and contained both 5' and 3' non-translated regions (NTR), as well as a poly-A tail. The complete genome length of AstV-MLB1 was 6,171 bp, excluding the poly-A tail, slightly shorter when compared to other astrovirus genomes which range in size between ~6,400 and 7,300 bp [1] . A comparison of AstV-MLB1 genomic elements with those of fully sequenced astroviruses is shown in Table 1 .",

The protein alignment of ORF1a revealed that AstV-MLB1 has a sequence motif similar to the putative NLS of human astroviruses. This region of the genome has also been predicted to potentially encode for a viral genome-linked protein (VPg) [23] . The high sequence similarity observed between AstV-MLB1 and other astroviruses in the motifs identified as essential for a putative VPg suggests that AstV-MLB1 may also encode a VPg (data not shown). While no experimental data exists supporting the prediction of the presence of a Vpg being encoded in any of the astrovirus genomes, we should note that we did encounter difficulty in obtaining the 5' end of the MLB1 genome until treatment of the RNA with proteinase K prior to RNA extraction was added to the experimental protocol.",

The shorter length of AstV-MLB1 ORF1a relative to the human astroviruses is largely attributable to two deletions totaling 57 amino acids located within a highly conserved motif near the carboxyl terminus of human astroviruses 1-8. This deletion falls within a 144 aa region that has been mapped as being an immunoreactive epitope in human astroviruses [24] and is located in the non-structural protein p38 [21] . Recently, p38 has been reported to lead to apoptosis of the host cell which results in efficient virus replication [25] and particle release [26] . However, it is unclear how the genome deletion identified in AstV-MLB1 might influence these activities.",

Alternately, it may be a passenger virus present simply as a result of dietary ingestion, as has been described previously for plant viruses detected in human stool [34] . Of course, viruses derived from dietary intake that appear to cause human disease, such as Aichi virus, have been described previously [35, 36] . Another possibility is that this virus may represent zoonotic transmission from some other animal species that is the true host for Astrovirus MLB1. Traditionally it has been thought that astroviruses have a strict species tropism. However, recent evidence has emerged that suggests that interspecies transmission does occur. For example, chicken astrovirus antibodies have been detected in turkeys [37] and an astrovirus was isolated from humans whose capsid sequence most closely resembled that of feline astrovirus [1] . Because of the uncertainty as to the identity of the true host species and the host range for this virus, we have tentatively named this novel virus Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1).

It is therefore tempting to speculate that AstV-MLB1 is the pathogenic agent that caused this case of diarrhea. However, whether AstV-MLB1 is a bona fide human virus capable of causing diarrhea will have to be established by further experimentation and epidemiological surveys.",

For reverse transcription reactions, cDNA was generated with MonsterScript RT at 65\u00b0C and amplified with Taq (Invitrogen). Subsequent 5' and 3' RACE reactions were done to obtain the entire genome. To generate high quality sequence coverage, 7 pairs of specific primers that spanned the complete genome in overlapping ~1 kb fragments were used in RT-PCR reactions and then cloned and sequenced using standard Sanger sequencing chemistry. All amplicons were cloned into pCR4.0 (Invitrogen). These 7 primer pairs were used to confirm the sequence of the viral genome from both the primary stool sample and the passage 2 tissue culture sample. The complete genome sequence of AstV-MLB1 has been deposited in [GenBank: FJ222451].",
