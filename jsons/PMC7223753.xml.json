According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 177,000 hospitalizations yearly have been attributed to RSV infections alone among adults aged over 65 years [2]. In general, patients aged 65 years or older had 3\u20135 times higher hospitalization rates with longer length of stay (LOS), and twice as many emergency department (room) (ER) and ambulatory visits compared to those aged 18\u201349 years. RSV is also the cause for LRTI in many immunocompromised patients, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including lung transplant recipients, and those with leukemia, lymphoma, or other cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, and those with advanced HIV [3].",

Worldwide, no specific treatment for RSV has received marketing authorization for use in adults; therefore, the standard of care is supportive treatment, such as intravenous fluid hydration and oxygen supplementation. The only treatment options with antiviral activity are aerosolized, intravenous, or orally administered ribavirin [5\u20137]. Inhaled ribavirin has limited evidence of effectiveness and carries potential risks such as teratogenicity, bronchospasm, or anemia [8] for both the patient and their care providers. While approved in some countries for severely ill young children, the treatment is not generally recommended in pediatric patients [6, 9]. Ribavirin has been used in adult patients, primarily among those who are immunocompromised, but supporting data are limited [10, 11].",

Elderly patients are also more prone to RSV infections due to their decreased immunologic response to the virus [13]. The morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of RSV may therefore also be driven through the exacerbation of underlying illness as well as the infection itself [14, 15]. Current research on healthcare resource utilization of RSV-related infection focuses mainly on either pediatric or adult patients with private healthcare insurance [16\u201318]. Less has been published on healthcare utilization and burden of disease among elderly Medicare patients diagnosed with RSV-related infections in the USA. To address these data gaps, the purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of adult RSV-infected patients in the inpatient and outpatient setting as well as predictors of hospitalization, and to describe the current clinical and economic burden of RSV among elderly Medicare patients in the USA.",

Of high-risk patients initially hospitalized, hypertension (76.3%), COPD (53.7%), high cholesterol (52.0%), diabetes (41.1%), CHF (41.1%), CAD (39.8%), CKD (31.0%), and previous evidence of pneumonia (42.3%) were among the most prevalent comorbid conditions during the baseline period. These conditions were also the most common comorbidities occurring among high-risk patients in the outpatient cohort (Table 1).",

This methodology may have led to the underestimation or overestimation of the actual number of RSV cases, as there could be an inherent difficulty of distinguishing between RSV and RSV-like illness, although we did exclude patients with influenza and hMPV to get a more exclusive sample of patients with RSV. Complications were identified as conditions that occurred 6 months following an RSV diagnosis date (ICD-9/ICD-10 codes); therefore, we could not ascertain whether the conditions were an actual complication of RSV or a progression of an underlying disease that may have been exacerbated as a result of RSV. In addition, RSV complications related to the disease progression or exacerbation of underlying chronic conditions such as COPD or CHF were not captured because of the lack of relevant diagnostic codes in the data. Therefore, we might have underestimated the rate of complications in this population. We also could not distinguish between community-acquired and hospital-acquired RSV infection because of lack of ICD codes to differentiate between 2 settings. Moreover, this study used a fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare database that includes information on Medicare FFS beneficiaries only (approx. 69% of Medicare beneficiaries in 2015) [33], which may limit the generalizability of the study results to patients with commercial insurance plans.",
