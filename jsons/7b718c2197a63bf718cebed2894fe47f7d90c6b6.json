Previous studies of a shorter duration have reported HCoV detection rates with larger variations from 1% to 15% [15, [19] [20] [21] . We also found that the control group had a detection rate of similar magnitude (10.2%), as has been reported before [21, 23] . This finding may question whether HCoVs are the causal pathogen of RTIs when HCoVs are detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates. Another prominent finding was the high viral codetection rates in more than two-thirds of the infected children, as well as in the controls. Previously, somewhat lower codetection rates have been reported [10, 17, 18, 22, 30] , but our finding might simply reflect the high number of virus types analyzed in our study. In the current study, children with RTIs were more likely to have a codetection of RSV and other viruses known for their potential to cause severe RTIs, whereas controls more often had a codetection of less-pathogenic viruses. This finding might also question whether HCoV caused the RTIs in this study. However, we made 3 observations on the basis of genomic loads estimations, which support that HCoV causes RTIs among hospitalized children. First, assuming that a high genomic load more than a low genomic load usually indicates an active infection, we found that children with RTIs were more likely to have a high HCoV genomic load than the controls. Second, children with a single HCoV infection were more likely to have a higher genomic load (67%) compared to those with a codetection of rhinovirus and other less-pathogenic viruses (41.8%), and those with codetections of RSV and other viruses with the potential to cause severe RTIs (24.3%). van der Hoek et al have published similar findings for HCoV subtype NL63 [16] . Finally, a high genomic load of HCoV was independently associated with RTIs in multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for severe viral codetections and other confounder variables.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 274, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 275, "end": 279, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 280, "end": 284, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 285, "end": 289, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 408, "end": 412, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 413, "end": 416, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 749, "end": 753, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 754, "end": 757, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 762, "end": 765, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 766, "end": 769, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1890, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Relation Between HCoV and RTIs in Need of Hospitalization"}, {"text": "In the control group, HCoV genomic load did not differ between those with single and codetections.

These figures may be an overestimation due to the possible contribution of RSV and other codetected viruses, but because the exact causal contribution of each codetected virus is difficult to ascertain, we decided to report incidence rates based on the total number of HCoV-positive samples. Our incidence rates were calculated only for LRTIs, because URTIs are underreported in our hospital patient administrative system. Previously, only a few studies have reported hospitalization rates in HCoV-infected children, and these data are difficult to compare with ours [13] [14] [15] [16] . On the basis of calculations in our dataset, we have recently published a somewhat higher hospitalization rate for HMPV compared to HCoV (1.9 LRTIs per 1000 children <5 years old), and RSV appeared 7 times more often (10.5 LRTIs per 1000 children <5 years old) [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 743, "end": 747, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 748, "end": 752, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hospitalization Rates of Children With HCoV and LRTIs"}, {"text": "To give a more precise estimation of the burden of HCoV, we also reported on the LRTI hospitalization rates for detections with high genomic loads and single detections of OC43 and NL63.

For children younger than 5 years, the hospitalization rates for a high genomic load of OC43 and NL63 infections were 3.0 and 1.6 per 10 000 children, respectively. In a comparable study over 5 consecutive years, van der Hoek et al reported a somewhat higher hospitalization rate for NL63 (2.2 per 10 000 children <3 years old), even when they defined a NL63 infection as a single NL63 detection with high genomic loads (>10 000 copies/mL in nasopharyngeal aspirate) [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 814, "end": 818, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hospitalization Rates of Children With HCoV and LRTIs"}, {"text": "The strengths of the present study are the population basis and prospective enrollment of children with infections from the same county in Norway over a 9-year period.
