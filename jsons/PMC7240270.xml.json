Clinical presentations associated with COVID-19 are variable in severity, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care (2,3). In symptomatic individuals, COVID-19 typically manifests as an influenza-like respiratory illness, with fever, cough, dyspnea, and malaise/myalgias (4). Atypical presentations, however, are frequent and include extrapulmonary involvement such as gastrointestinal symptoms, multi-organ failure (liver, kidneys, heart), and neurologic manifestations (5, 6, 7) (Figure 1\n). Recently, there has been increasing recognition of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19, prompting this review of treatment strategies for the management of delirium in these patients.",

We have seen that some patients are admitted with confusion and agitation as their presenting symptom, in the absence of respiratory symptoms or other signs of infection. In addition to significant agitation and attentional impairment, exams have been notable in varying degrees for myoclonus, rigidity, alogia, and abulia (15). As such, we have tailored our exams to specifically evaluate for catatonia and akinetic mutism.

The severity of systemic illness (and the associated metabolic derangements and inflammatory cascades) in some COVID-19 patients is likely sufficient to cause the toxic-metabolic encephalopathy often seen in hospitalized patients. However, some features of SARS-CoV-2 and specifically the presentation of patients with severe confusional states in the absence of respiratory symptoms or other organ failure, have raised questions about possible alternative mechanisms of CNS injury. Cases of SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis (16) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been recently described (17). Anosmia and ageusia may be early features of SARS-CoV-2 infection (18), implying direct invasion of the olfactory bulb. These revelations have led several investigators to propose multiple potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may induce mental status changes in its victims, including infectious spread to the CNS by retrograde transport or hematogenous spread, dysregulation of cytokine activation leading to CNS inflammation, induction of cell-mediated CNS inflammation, post-infectious autoimmune reactions via molecular mimicry, and hypoxemic/thrombotic neuronal injury (5,19). Some authors have also hypothesized that hematogenous spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the periventricular system may lead a clinical picture of akinetic mutism even in the absence of a lesion detected on neuroimaging (15).",

More recent data also suggests specific utility in COVID-19, perhaps due to its sleep-regulating, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective factors (21, 22, 23). In theory, the age-related decline in melatonin levels may be one factor contributing to increased delirium risk and worse COVID-19 outcomes among elderly patients. Melatonin exerts its soporific effects through circadian entrainment and may also offer neuroprotection via increased BDNF expression and attenuation of N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate excitotoxicity, as well as the prevention of kainic acid-induced neuronal lesions, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptotic nerve cell death (24, 25, 26). It also has a relatively good safety profile. We recommend considering the addition of melatonin in all COVID-19 patients. It is worth noting, however, that for patients with severe immunocompromise, the immunosuppressive effects of melatonin may be detrimental. Though speculative, it is possible that there is heterogeneity in the COVID-19 patients who develop ARDS \u2013 those who do not mount enough of an immune response, and those whose overactive immune response leads to cytokine storm. Melatonin might be particularly useful in the latter group.",

Amantadine has a dual mechanism of action, serving as an NMDA-receptor antagonist and a dopamine-receptor agonist. It has a wide dose range and is usually well-tolerated, though it can lower the seizure threshold and is contraindicated in end stage renal disease (55). Rapid tapering can lead to a withdrawal delirium (56). Though an intravenous form is available internationally, only the pill form is available in the US. Amantadine may be especially useful for treating catatonia in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, as benzodiazepines would be relatively contraindicated due to respiratory suppression, and electroconvulsive therapy can aerosolize virus particles (57).",

Nonetheless, for COVID-19 patients with severe agitation, the use of lorazepam in combination with antipsychotic agents may allow for greater sedation and lower the risk of EPS. This is especially true for patients who have been on prolonged high dose benzodiazepine drips in the ICU setting and may experience withdrawal if tapered too quickly. Recommendations for the management of delirium in the United Kingdom have also commented on the potential utility of benzodiazepines in COVID-19 delirium (61). Lorazepam has the advantage of being quick-acting and available in a variety of forms. Lorazepam may still be useful for catatonia assessment in patients with abulia and alogia, but extreme caution is necessary given the risk of respiratory suppression in patients with pneumonia or ARDS.",

However, given the pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory state that accompanies COVID-19 delirium, and given the limited knowledge surrounding effective treatments, we advocate that a lower threshold be maintained for the use of safe and relatively inexpensive nutritional interventions with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. A recent meta-regression analysis demonstrated strong evidence that vitamin C shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients, particularly severely ill patients who required mechanical ventilation for more than ten hours, and it is currently being studied as a COVID-19 intervention (62,63). Low levels of Vitamin D have been correlated with risk of delirium (64,65), and omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced patient-days with delirium and mechanical ventilation (66). Indeed, vitamin C, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids have all been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and may work synergistically against the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 and specifically against the neuro-inflammation associated with its delirium (67, 68, 69).",

Many patients admitted with COVID-19 will likely receive this medication. Remdesivir is metabolized by CYP450 2C8, 2D6, and 3A4, and could potentially interact with psychiatric medications; blood levels of remdesivir may decrease when administered with CYP450 inducers such as phenobarbital and carbamazepine (73). Consultation-psychiatrists are strongly encouraged to perform an interaction check when selecting pharmacologic agents for delirium in patients receiving remdesivir. Of note, we performed a Lexicomp interaction check for all medications reviewed in this article with remdesivir and found no significant interactions.",

In our narrative review of the literature and clinical experience, we have provided a possible framework and algorithm for pharmacologic selection in COVID-19 delirium. Our recommendations take into account anecdotal observations that some patients with COVID-19 delirium appear to have increased rates of myoclonus, rigidity, alogia, and abulia, suggesting a dopamine depletion state or catatonia-spectrum condition. When there are no absolute contraindications to any particular class of medication, we preferentially use alpha-2 agonists and low potency antipsychotics to manage behavioral disturbance. We nonetheless recommend a thoughtful, individualized, step-based approach to management.",

Whereas some patients may become delirious due to the likely pro-inflammatory burden of ARDS, it may be that others experience direct invasion of the virus into the CNS, though this is yet to be determined. Future directions include amassing a more extensive collection of COVID-19 delirium cases. Objective measures such as MRI, EEG and cerebrospinal fluid studies would be particularly useful in understanding the neurobiology of the condition but are currently limited by the necessity of minimizing staff exposure to COVID-19. We expect that as more cases are identified and treated, our understanding of the pathophysiology will improve, and recommendations for managing delirium may evolve.",

Medication recommendations were extrapolated from previous delirium literature and adapted for patients with delirium in the setting of COVID-19 based on clinical experience from the MGH Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry COVID-19 Workgroup. If evidence of akinetic mutism or catatonia, consider adding amantadine 100mg daily (titrated over 3-4 days to 600mg daily) or methylphenidate 5-10mg twice daily. Monitor for seizures with amantadine and worsening psychosis. Dopamine Agonist. Step 5. If additional agents required, or if antipsychotic agents are relatively contraindicated, consider using valproic acid 15mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses PO or IV daily or trazodone 12.5-50mg every 6 hours as needed. Titrate to effect. Valproic Acid or Trazodone. Step 4. Consider antipsychotic agent for ongoing agitation. Low-potency agents preferred. May consider aripiprazole specifically for hypoactive delirium with perceptual disturbance. Use caution with antipsychotics if evidence of EPS, akinetic mutism or catatonia. Antipsychotic Agent. Step 3. Start melatonin at 1-3mg daily at 1800 hours. Dose regularly at the same time. Exercise caution in patients for whom there is evidence of inadequate immune response. Melatonin. Step 1. Consider using dexmedetomidine for ICU patients. Wean by no more than 20% per day. Can cross taper with clonidine patch, starting 0.1mg patch the night before wean attempt. Oral clonidine 0.1-0.3mg three times per day can also be used for agitation. Alpha-2 Agonist. Step 2",
