Since there is similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 (a gene detected from a bat), researchers supposed that bat is an initial host. Following studies suggested pig or pangolin as a possible intermediate host. Animal repository of COVID-19 is probably snake [6]. It appears that the infection was first transmitted through zoonotic agents (from animal to human). Despite the sea food market being closed, rates of infected patients increased, which indicated human-to-human transmission.",

Common symptoms are fever, nonproductive cough and myalgia or fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. At first people may complain of diarrhea and nausea. A few days later, they develop fever. Fever is usually detected in patients but it is not the main symptom. Headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are some of the less common symptoms. ICU care is required for aged patients or patients likely to have comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular disorders. Subsequent problems during hospitalization are mostly acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia, and shock. According to scientific observations, as the status of patient gets worse, urea and creatinine blood levels gradually rised [9,10]. Another common symptom in patients is lymphopenia that possibly is a serious issue during hospitalization so there may be correlation between lymphopenia and severity or mortality of the disease [11].",
