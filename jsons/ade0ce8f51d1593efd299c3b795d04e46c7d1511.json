While risk factors such as lifestyle patterns, genetic traits, blood lipid levels, and diabetes can contribute to its development, advancing age remains the most determinant predictor of cardiac disease. Several parameters of left ventricular function may be affected with aging, including increased duration of systole, decreased sympathetic stimulation, and increased left ventricle ejection time, while compliance decreases. In addition, changes in cardiac phenotype with diastolic dysfunction, reduced contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy, and HF, all increase in incidence with age. Given the limited capacity that the heart has for regeneration, reversing or slowing the progression of these abnormalities poses a major challenge. In this chapter, we present a discussion on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies and HF in aging and the potential involvement of specific genes identified as primary mediators of these diseases.",

Basic mechanisms that have been proposed for cardiac aging are discussed in this chapter including cell senescent, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory changes, decreased a and b-adrenoreceptors (AR) mediated contractility, increased levels of G-proteins-coupled receptors, impaired intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, decreased IGF-1 levels, cellular damage/ cell loss, telomerase inactivation, abnormal autophagy, and altered membrane structure and permeability, all of which may lead to abnormal cardiac contractile function and contribute to the development of HF [9, 10] . the site, source and amount of ROS produced, as well as the overall redox status of the cell.

Thus, in the aging failing heart, neutralization of ROS by mitochondrial antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione becomes critically important. During aging, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation may also trigger increased apoptosis, with resultant cell loss. This loss in cardiomyocytes may be secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by chronic exposure to ROS, damage to mtDNA (mutations and deletions) and to mitochondrial membranes. While mtDNA damage occurs with aging, mtDNA levels, although decreased in liver and skeletal muscle, are for the most part preserved in the aging heart.",

Interestingly, aging-related defects have been found in the interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM), in which complex III and IV activity and rate of OXPHOS were decreased, while the subsarcolemmal mitochondrial (SSM) electron transport chain (ETC) activity remained normal [13] [14] [15] . The selective alteration of IFM during aging suggests that the consequences of aginginduced mitochondrial dysfunction may be enhanced in specific subcellular regions of the senescent cardiomyocyte. Recent observations suggested that mitochondrial ROS cause OS and impaired mitochondrial function in IFM to a greater degree than in SSM with age, and because of their proximity to myofibrils, IFM are probably the primary source of ATP for myosin ATPases, and therefore OS in IFM may be the culprit for the myocardial dysfunction occurring with aging [16] . It is important to keep in mind that the subfractionation of mitochondria may provide a mixture of organelles of SSM and IFM that may complicate the assessment of the agerelated changes in mitochondrial oxidant production and OS. Therefore, further studies in this area are needed.",

            "text": "In early myocardial reperfusion, a burst of ROS occurs in association with changes in mitochondria (e.g., PT pore opening) and myocardial injury. The source of this ROS generation may be of either mitochondrial or cytoplasmic origin. On the other hand, the source of ROS generated during ischemia (and likely in the early/acute pathway of ischemic preconditioning) involves more distinctively the mitochondrial ETC and may be different than the source of ROS generated in early reperfusion [17, 18] . OS also appears to participate in the generation of large-scale myocardial mtDNA deletions as demonstrated in pacing-induced cardiac failure [19] , as well as in studies of ameroid constriction-mediated myocardial ischemia in the dog [20] . Moreover, neonatal cardiac myocytes treated with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) showed a significant increase in ROS levels, and this is accompanied by an overall decline in mtDNA copy number and decreased complex III activity [21] . These findings suggest that the TNF-a-mediated decline in mtDNA copy number might result from an increase in mtDNA deletions. Thus, in aging and in the aging failing heart, accumulation of ROS initiates a vicious circle following somatic mtDNA damage as shown in Fig. 16 .2. During aging and after myocardial infarction, ROS-induced mtDNA damage, resulting in respiratory complex enzyme dysfunction, contributes to the progression of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. In a murine model of MI and remodeling created by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, increased ROS production (e.g., OH \u2022 level) was shown in association with decreased levels of mtDNA and ETC activities, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction [22] . Significantly, the chronic release of ROS has been linked to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and advanced HF. As noted in previous chapters, chronic ROS generation can derive both from mitochondria and from nonmitochondrial NADPH oxidase that in endothelial cells is activated by cytokines, neurohormones, and growth factors (e.g., angiotensin II, norepinephrine, TNF-a) [23, 24] . Furthermore, changes in the cardiac phenotype can be driven by redox-sensitive gene expression, in this way ROS may act as potent intracellular second messengers.",

Contractile indices analyzed included peak shortening (PS), time-to-90% PS (TPS90), time-to-90% relengthening (TR90), half-width duration (HWD), maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (\u00b1dL/dt), and intracellular Ca 2+ levels or decay rate. Levels of advanced glycation endproduct (AGE), Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX), sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), myosin heavy chain (MHC), membrane Ca 2+ and K + channels were measured by Western blotting Catalase transgene prolonged survival while did not alter myocyte function by itself. Aging depressed \u00b1dL/dt, prolonged HWD, TR90 and intracellular Ca 2+ decay without affecting other indices in FVB myocytes. Aged FVB myocytes exhibited a stepper decline in PS in response to elevated stimulus or a dampened rise in PS in response to elevated extracellular Ca 2+ levels. Aging-induced defects were attenuated by catalase. AGE level was elevated in aged FVB compared with young FVB mice, which was reduced by catalase. Expression of SERCA2a, NCX and Kv1.2 K + channel was significantly reduced although levels of PLB, L-type Ca 2+ channel dihydropyridine receptor and b-MHC isozyme remained unchanged in aged FVB hearts. Catalase restored NCX and Kv1.2 K + channel but not SERCA2a level in the aged mice. These data suggest that catalase protects the cardiomyocytes from aging-induced contractile dysfunction possibly via improved intracellular Ca 2+ handling. By catalyzing conversion of H 2 O 2 to oxygen and water, catalase would shift redox balance toward antioxidant end, leading to increased myocardial antioxidant capacity, which may offset the detrimental effect of H 2 O 2 (a model illustrating the triggering stimuli and cellular pathways involved in the onset and progression of HF is shown in Chap. 5) (see Fig. 5.1) .",

Upon examining the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in aging-related myocardial ischemic injury, as well as its relation to b-AR stimulation, they found that iNOS is upregulated in the aging rat heart [33] . Isolated perfused hearts from young (3-5 months) and aging (24-25 months) rats subjected to 30 min of myocardial ischemia resulted in cardiac dysfunction. Infusion of isoproterenol for 30 min caused a partial recovery of cardiac function in hearts from young rats, receiving either vehicle or 1,400 W (a nonselective iNOS inhibitor). In striking contrast, isoproterenol infusion to hearts from aging animals receiving vehicle failed to improve ischemiainduced cardiodepression and worsened cardiac function, with a significant increase in myocardial NO production, peroxynitrite formation, caspase-3 activation, and creatine kinase release. Therefore, b-AR stimulation interacts with ischemia and triggers a significant increase in myocardial NO production, creates a nitrosative stress, generates toxic peroxynitrite, activates apoptosis, and eventually causes cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury in the aging heart. Moreover, myocardial NO production, peroxynitrite formation, and caspase-3 activation were attenuated and LV function significantly improved in aging heart treated with the iNOS inhibitor, 1,400 W. Compared to young rat hearts, significant increases in iNOS protein expression, activity, and immunoreactivity were found in the aging heart, confirming that aging induces a phenotypic upregulation of myocardial iNOS and that there is a critical link between iNOS-generated NO production and aging-associated myocardial ischemia.",

While impairment in b-AR signaling is known to occur in the aging heart, the components of the a1-AR signaling cascade that are responsible for the aging-associated deficit in a1-AR contractile function have just begun to be identified. To determine that the aged heart has an impaired response to a1-adrenergic stimulation, Montagne et al. [41] measured both cardiomyocyte Ca 2+ -transient and cardiac protein kinase C (PKC) activity in young (3 months) and old Wistar rats (24 months). Ca 2+ transients were obtained under 1 Hz pacing by microfluorimetry of cardiomyocyte loaded with indo-1 and compared during control conditions and after a1-adrenergic stimulation (phenylephrine or cirazoline, an a1-specific agonist). In addition, the activity of PKC and PKC translocation index were assayed before and after a1adrenergic stimulation. In the young animals, cirazoline induced a significant increase in Ca 2+ transient for up to 10 \u22129 M concentration which returned to control values for larger concentrations. In contrast, in the old animals, there was a constant negative effect of cirazoline on the Ca 2+ transient with a significant decrease at 10 \u22126 M compared with both baseline and Kreb's solution. In a dose-response curve to phenylephrine, prior experiments showed that the response of Ca 2+ transient was maximal at 10 \u22127 M. This concentration induced a significant increase in Ca 2+ transient in the young and a significant decrease in old rats. The same concentration was chosen to perform PKC activity measurements under a1-adrenergic stimulation. In the basal state, PKC activity was higher in the older than in the younger animals but was not different in cytosolic fractions; thus, the translocation index was higher in the old group. Following the administration of phenylephrine, translocation of PKC toward the particulate fraction was observed in the young but not in old rats. Taken together, the data showed that cardiac a1-adrenoceptor response was impaired in aged hearts and that the negative effect of a1-adrenergic stimulation on Ca 2+ transient in cardiomyocytes in the old rats can be related to an absence of a1-adrenergic-induced PKC translocation.",

Upon assessing the subcellular distribution of PKCa and PKCe, and their respective anchoring proteins RACK1 and RACK2 by Western blotting, they found that the subcellular translocation of PKCa and PKCe, in response to a1-AR stimulation, is disrupted in the aging myocardium. Age-related reductions in RACK1 and RACK2 levels were also observed, suggesting that alterations in PKC-anchoring proteins may contribute to impaired PKC translocation and defective a1-AR contraction in the aged rat heart. Interestingly, the investigators also sought to determine whether age-related defects in a1-AR contraction could be reversed by chronic exercise training (treadmill) in adult and aged rat [43] . The data revealed that age-related decrease in a1-AR contractility in the rat heart can be partially reversed by exercise suggesting that alterations in PKC levels underlie, at least in part, exercise training-induced improvements in a1-AR contraction.",

Notwithstanding these findings, the effect of aging on the human sympathetic nervous system remains a controversial issue. At present, interest in this subject has significantly increased, mainly because diverse cardiac pathologies, including essential hypertension, CAD, HF, and dysrhythmias increase with age, and the sympathetic nervous system may be an important pathophysiological component [45] .

Coupling of cardiac b2-ARs to Ga i inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) and opposes b1-AR-mediated apoptosis [48] . Studies on advanced HF have shown that Ga i2 levels increase with age in both human atria [49] , and in ventricles of old (24 months) Fischer 344 rats resulting in diminished AC activity [48] .

Interestingly, in elderly subjects of similar ages, those with diabetes have 1.7-fold higher levels of Ga i2 and twofold higher levels of Gb 1 . On the other hand, it has been reported that right atrial mAChR density significantly decreased in advanced age [52] . The disparity between these findings could be explained by differences in age between patient groups; one study examined only adults with an age range from 41 to 85 years [51] , while the other study group's age ranged from 5 days to 76 years [52] . Analysis of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) activity (by in vitro rhodopsin phosphorylation) in the right atria from 16 children (mean age 9 \u00b1 2 years) and 17 elderly patients (mean age 67 \u00b1 2 years) without apparent HF and the RA from four patients with end-stage HF showed that in contrast to the failing human heart, in the aging human heart, GRK activity was not increased [54] . These observations suggest that GRK activity may not have an important role in b-AR desensitization in the aging human heart, but why GRK's regulation is different in the human aging heart than in the failing human heart is not yet completely understood. Leineweber et al. [53] have found that with aging increase in sympathetic activity develops slowly and moderately, since plasma noradrenaline levels (often taken as an indirect index of sympathetic activity) [54] increase continuously at a 10-15% rate per decade due to enhanced spillover of noradrenaline into the circulation [55, 56] . In contrast, in HF, increases in sympathetic activity occur much more rapidly and are more pronounced than in the aging heart [57] . Thus, the time course and intensity of increases in sympathetic activity in the aging and the failing human heart are dissimilar, and this may explain differences in regulation of GRKs in the aging compared to the failing human heart.",

            "text": "Myocardial contraction and relaxation are regulated by the concentration of Ca 2+ around the contractile elements in cardiomyocytes. After contraction, relaxation is brought about by lowering Ca 2+ levels. A major contribution to this process is made by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA), a 110-kD transmembrane protein, which pumps cytoplasmic Ca 2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [64] . Three SERCA genes have been identified so far as SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3 encoding six distinct proteins isoforms by alternative explicing [65, 66] with the SERCA2a being the predominant isoform expressed in the heart. Since SERCA2a plays an important role in intracellular Ca 2+ hemostasis and cardiac contractility, the abnormal expression of SERCA2a in the senescent heart is likely to have major biochemical and pathophysiological effects. As a matter of fact, senescent is characterized by reduced myocardial contractility velocity and prolonged relaxation time. These changes might be related to decreased expression and activity of SERCA, which controls the rate of SR calcium uptake during relaxation. The cardiac SERCA pumps Ca 2+ from the cytosol back to the SR and is considered an important determinant of intracellular Ca 2+ signaling and cardiac contractility. At least in part, the increased susceptibility to HF of the aging heart may be mediated by abnormal Ca 2+ handling and decreased expression of the SERCA gene [67] . The molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac SERCA expression in aging are still unclear; however, new studies implicated a decreased thyroid hormone (TH) responsiveness in the aging rat heart; in large part, this decrease involves binding of the TH receptor (TR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer to TH-responsive elements (TREs) located in the SERCA and cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene promoters. Age-associated changes in the TR and RXR could explain the age-associated changes in SERCA and MHC expression. Long et al. found no significant myocardial changes in RXRa or RXRb mRNA levels in the aging rat heart, although both a1 and a2 TR mRNA levels decreased significantly between 2 and 6 months of age [68] . During this time period, the mRNA levels for a-MHC declined by more than half, whereas b-MHC mRNA levels remained unchangingly low. In contrast, between 6 and 24 months, when mRNA levels for b-MHC increased and a-MHC continued to decrease, there was a significant decline in TRb1 and RXRg mRNA levels accompanied by a reduction in the TRb1 and RXRg protein levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that decline in a-MHC gene expression may be biphasic and in part due to a decline in a1 (and possibly a2) TR levels between 2 and 6 months of age, and a decline in TRb1 and RXRg levels at later age.",

Furthermore, the activity of TR DNA binding to the TRE transcriptional regulatory region in the a-MHC and SERCA genes and the myocardial expression of a-MHC and SERCA (both mRNA and protein) were upregulated with exercise training in the aging heart, in association with changes in the myocardial TR protein levels. In addition, plasma 3,3\u00a2-triiodothyronine (T3) and TH levels, which decrease with aging [70, 71] , are increased after exercise training.

In the aging heart, therapies that increase SERCA activity might improve cardiac performance, and Ca 2+ cycling proteins can be targeted to improve cardiac function [72] . Decline in myocardial SERCA content with age may also contribute to the development of impaired function after I/R. Moreover, the ratio of SERCA to either phospholamban or calsequestrin decreased in the senescent human myocardium [73] . Decreased rates of Ca 2+ transport mediated by the SERCA isoform are responsible for the slower sequestration of cytosolic Ca 2+ and consequently prolonged muscle relaxation times in the aging heart. Knyushko et al. [74] found that senescent Fischer 344 rat heart had a 60% decrease in SERCA activity in comparison to that of young adult hearts, and this functional reduction in activity could be attributed in part to both lower abundance of SERCA protein and increased 3-nitrotyrosine modifications of multiple tyrosines within the cardiac SERCA protein. Nitration in the senescent heart was found to increase by more than two nitrotyrosines per Ca 2+ -ATPase, coinciding with the appearance of partially nitrated Tyr(294), Tyr(295), and Tyr(753) residues. In contrast, skeletal muscle SERCA exhibited a homogeneous pattern of nitration, with full site nitration of Tyr(753) in the young, with additional nitration of Tyr(294) and Tyr(295) in the senescent muscle. The nitration of these latter sites correlates with diminished transport function in both types of muscle, suggesting that these sites have a potential role in the down-regulation of ATP utilization by the Ca 2+ -ATPase under conditions of nitrosative stress.",

IGF-1 decreased linearly with age in both sexes, with significantly higher levels in men than women [75] . The decrease in GH-induced IGF-1 secretion in the elderly suggests that resistance to the action of GH may be a secondary contributing factor in the low plasma IGF-1 concentrations [76] . Decreased IGF-1 levels with age may contribute to the increase in cardiac disease found in the elderly, including HF [77] . Findings from the Framingham Heart Study in a prospective, community-based investigation indicated that serum IGF-1 level was inversely related to the risk for HF in the elderly without a previous MI, suggesting that the maintenance of an optimal IGF-1 levels in aged individuals may reduce the risk for HF [78] . In addition, this study revealed that greater levels or production of the catabolic cytokines TNF-a and interleukin 6 were associated with increased mortality in community-dwelling elderly adults, whereas IGF-1 levels had the opposite effect [79] . In aged animals and humans, the secretion of GH and the response of GH to the administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) are lower than in young adults [80] . In rodents, a twofold increase in GH receptors has been observed with age but this increase fails to compensate for the reduction in GH secretion [81, 82] . Further studies revealed that the apparent size of the GH receptor was not altered with age, whereas the capacity of GH to induce IGF-1 gene expression and secretion was 40-50% less in old than in young animal [77] .",

Interestingly, GH can induce improvement in hemodynamic and clinical status in some patients with chronic HF, largely resulting from the ability of GH to increase cardiac mass [83] . However, disappointing results have been reported in patients with DCM undergoing infusion of GH [84] ; this could be related to the choice of an incorrect agent (GH instead of IGF-1) and/or failure to selectively target patients with low IGF-1 levels [85] . Recently, in a meta-analysis of clinical studies, Tritos and Danias [86] evaluated the efficacy and safety of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy in severe HF. Therapy with rhGH appears to have beneficial clinical effects in HF including improved exercise duration, maximum oxygen consumption, and New York Heart Association class. Also, there was hemodynamic improvement, including increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance and improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, with no adverse effects on diastolic function. Most of the beneficial effects were driven by either uncontrolled or longer duration studies. Interestingly, rhGH therapy slightly increased the risk for ventricular dysrhythmias; although this finding was driven by a single small study. This meta-analysis suggests that rhGH therapy may have beneficial effects in cases of HF secondary to LV systolic dysfunction and that the possibility of prodysrhythmia associated with rhGH therapy merits further assessment. Furthermore, larger randomized trials with longer treatment duration are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of rhGH therapy in human HF.",

Kirkwood [92] pointed out that there is a significant difference in assessing cell damage in vitro versus in vivo, with cells in culture reaching a limit in their potential for cell division/ differentiation, which may not occur in vivo. Therefore, caution is called for regarding the interpretation of data using different methodologies. During aging, there is a significant loss of postmitotic cells, such as cardiac myocytes, potentially triggered by the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation. For instance, in vitro studies of H 2 O 2 -treated cardiomyocytes showed that increased mitochondrial OS and declining mitochondrial energy production lead to the activation of apoptotic pathways [93, 94] , but whether this also occurs in the aging heart in vivo is not known. While the role and extent of apoptosis in normal myocardial aging is under considerable debate, evidence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been confirmed by data showing that the aging rat heart had significantly elevated levels of cytochrome c release from mitochondria, as well as decreased levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, whereas levels of the proapoptotic protein Bax were unchanged [12] . Furthermore, myocytes derived from hearts of old mice displayed increased levels of markers of cell death and senescence, compared to myocytes from younger animals [95] . It is possible that apoptosis, at least to a certain degree in cardiac aging, may be a protective mechanism to get rid of damaged, potentially dangerous cells in a mechanistic effort to tilt the balance toward healthy cells, although, we do not know where this balance is.",

Thus, induced expression of p16INK4A in these cells reverted their immortal phenotype and caused immedi-ate cellular senescence. Increased expression of p16INK4A also occurred in aging cardiomyocytes [95] . Proteins implicated in growth arrest and senescence, such as p27Kip1, p53, p16INK4a, and p19ARF, were also present in myocytes of young mice, and their expression increased with age. In addition, DNA damage and myocyte death were found to exceed cell formation in older mice, leading to a decline in the number of myocytes and to HF.

Although this cannot be explained by established risk factors, it may be explained by variation in biological age. During aging, telomeres length is progressively reduced in most somatic cells, and after a number of cell cycles, telomere length reaches a critical size, cellular replication stops and the cell becomes senescent (Fig. 16.3 ). Age-dependent telomere shortening in most somatic cells, including vascular endothelial cells, SMCs, and cardiomyocytes, appears to impair cellular function and the viability of the aged organism. While the association of telomere length and CVD appears likely, whether telomere shortening is a direct cause of the vascular pathology of aging or a consequence is not known [97] . Recently, telomere length has been reported to be shorter in circulating leukocytes of patients with HF compared with age-balanced and gender-balanced control patients, and appears to be related to the severity of disease. Furthermore, telomere length has been found to be incrementally shorter in relation to the presence and extent of atherosclerotic disease manifestations [98] . Notwithstanding, telomere dysfunction and reduction in telomere length has been observed with age in SMCs, endothelial, and white blood cells, and they may be the primary factor in predisposing vascular tissues to atherosclerosis, and also to a decreasing capacity for neovascularization [97] . This attrition of telomere length is most prominent under conditions of high OS, but particularly prevalent in hypertensives, diabetics, and individuals with CAD.",

Further studies have shown that telomere biology plays a significant role in the functional augmentation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by statins [101] . These studies found that the ex vivo culturing of EPCs leads to premature replicative senescence associated with the \"uncapping\" and dysfunction of telomeres, and loss of telomere repeat-binding factor (TRF2).

In germ cells (and tumor cells) containing high telomerase activity, no change in telomere length is seen with aging or progressive divisions. Accelerated telomere attrition is associated with human premature aging. Some of the phenotypic changes associated with telomere length are shown on the bottom right (e.g., estrogens, OS, hypertension, diabetes, and psychological stress), as well as to neovascularization and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and heart disease. They identify two still unanswered critical questions: (1) Whether telomere shortening is cause or consequence of cardiovascular disease, and (2) if therapies targeting the telomere may be applicable in treating these disorders (e.g., cell \"telomerization\" to engineer blood vessels of clinical value for bypass surgery, and to facilitate cell-based myocardial regeneration strategies). Since current research has been mainly focused on the role of telomerase, a suggestion is made that it is of up most importance to investigate whether defects in additional telomere-associated proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.",

This process is well conserved in nature from lower eukaryotes to mammals and has been attributed to disparate physiological events including cell death, which mechanism is different from apoptosis. A number of steps are involved in autophagy: (1) formation of a double membrane within the cell; (2) confinement of the material to be degraded into an autophagosome; (3) fusion of the autophagosome with a lysosome, and (4) the enzymatic degradation of the materials. Activated class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibit autophagy, while class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase acts as a facilitator [114] . Autophagy decreases during the development of myocardial hypertrophy and is enhanced during the regression of hypertrophy. It occurs in many types of cells during development including cardiomyocytes, and in pressure-overloaded animal models cardiomyocyte loss due to autophagy which occurs during the progression from compensated hypertrophy to HF. Moreover, in cardiac diseases associated with aging such as ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy, intralysosomal degradation of cells plays an essential role in the renewal of cardiac myocytes; being the interaction of mitochondria and lysosomes in cellular homeostasis of great significance, since both organelles suffer significant age-related alterations in postmitotic cells [115] . Many mitochondria undergo enlargement and structural disorganization, and since lysosomes responsible for mitochondrial turnover experience a loss of function, the rate of total mitochondrial protein turnover declines with age [116] . Coupled mitochondrial and lysosomal defects contribute to irreversible functional impairment and cell death, and similarly mitochondrial interaction with other functional compartments of the cardiac cell (e.g., the ER for Ca 2+ metabolism, peroxisomes for the interchange of antioxidant enzymes essential in the production and decomposition of H 2 O 2 ) must be kept in check since defects in communication between these organelles may accelerate the aging process.",

Exposure of confluent fibroblast cultures to 3MA for 2 weeks resulted in an increased number of dying cells compared to both untreated confluent cultures and dividing cells with 3MA-inhibited autophagy. Similarly, autophagic degradation was suppressed by the protease inhibitor leupeptin. These findings suggest that lysosomal \"garbage\" accumulation plays an important role in the aging and death of postmitotic cells, and also support the antiaging role of cell division.

The aging process was characterized by a loss of 38 million and 14 million nuclei/year in the left and right ventricles, respectively. This loss in muscle mass was accompanied Mitochondrial ROS production contributes to telomeredependent replicative senscence. Production of ROS by aberrant mitochondrial respiratory complexes thought to occur in aging leads to mtDNA and protein damage and lipid peroxidation, PT pore and apoptotic progression (via cytochrome c release, membrane permeabilization, apoptosome formation and nuclear DNA fragmentation). ROS also affects the nucleus by reducing telomerase activity and increasing its export from the nucleus, causing direct DNA damage and activating specific gene expression -all of which contribute to the signaling of replicative senescence. Also shown is the involvement of antioxidant response both in the mitochondria (e.g., MnSOD and GpX) and in the cytosol which can remove ROS by scavenging free radicals by a progressive increase in myocyte cell volume per nucleus, resulting in the preservation of ventricular wall thickness. However, the cellular hypertrophic response was unable to maintain normal cardiac mass. Left and right ventricular weights decreased by 0.70 and 0.21 g/year, respectively. Therefore, it was proposed that about one third of the cardiomyocytes are lost from the human heart between the ages of 17 and 90 years [119] . Several studies, however, have challenged the widely held, but unproven paradigm that describes the heart as a postmitotic organ [120] . Recent developments in the field of stem cell biology have led to the recognition that the possibility exists for extrinsic and intrinsic regeneration of myocytes and coronary vessels, leading to the reevaluation of cardiac homeostasis and myocardial aging [121] . A newer paradigm views the adult mammalian heart as composed of nondividing myocytes (primarily terminally differentiated), and a small and continuously renewed subpopulation of cycling myocytes produced by the differentiation of cardiac stem cells. A dynamic balance between myocyte death and the formation of new myocytes by cardiac stem cells is an important regulator of myocardial maintenance of function and mass from birth to adulthood and very critical in old age. Increasing evidence suggests that numerous pathological or physiological stimuli can activate stem cells to enter the cell cycle and differentiate into new myocytes, and in some cases vasculature which significantly contribute to changes in cardiac output and myocardial mass [122] .",

While aged diseased hearts exhibited moderate hypertrophy and dilation, they also displayed an accumulation of p16INK4a positive primitive stem cells and myocytes. A marked increase in cell death was primarily limited to cells expressing p16INK4a with significant telomeric shortening. Importantly, this finding suggested that stem cells could also be targeted by senescence. While cell multiplication, mitotic index, and telomerase increased in the aging heart, new evidence suggested that regenerative events could not compensate for cell death or prevent telomeric shortening. This study [124] also demonstrated that hearts from subjects with idiopathic DCM had more severe hypertrophy and dilation, more extensive cardiac interstitial fibrosis and tissue inflammatory injury, increased necrosis, and a reduced level of myocytes with p16INK4a labeling. This is consistent with the involvement of p16INK4a with death signals linked to apoptosis in senescent myocardium in contrast to idiopathic DCM, in which myocyte necrosis predominates and myocyte death is largely independent from the expression of the kinase inhibitor p16INK4a. Nonetheless, some important commonalities were also found: while idiopathic DCM had increased necrosis compared to aging tissues, aged diseased hearts and idiopathic DCM subjects had similar levels of myocyte apoptosis. In addition, extensive stem cell death was found in both cases and not in healthy controls, suggesting that mechanisms (e.g., OS) that target stem cells may contribute to the phenotype of cardiac dysfunction in both the aging and cardiomyopathic heart. Torella et al. have identified a population of cardiac stem cells in young and senescent mice that with aging display increased evidence of senescence, i.e., p16ink4a expression, telomere shortening (indicative of reduced telomerase activity), and apoptosis [95] . Interestingly, the effect of murine aging on cardiac stem cells (including the expression of gene products implicated in growth arrest and senescence, such as p27Kip1, p53, p16INK4a, and p19ARF), and on the resulting cardiac dysfunction was remarkably attenuated in aged transgenic mice containing overexpressed IGF-1. It remains to be seen whether similar effects of IGF-1 on preserving stem cell regenerative function would be found in strains with idiopathic DCM.",

[125] reported that chronological age leads to telomeric shortening in cardiac progenitor cell (CPCs), which generate a differentiated progeny that rapidly acquires the senescent phenotype, conditioning organ aging. Attenuation of the IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor and hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met systems mediate the CPC aging, which does not counteract any longer the CPC renin-angiotensin system, resulting in cellular senescence, growth arrest, and apoptosis. However, the senescent heart contains functionally competent CPCs with the properties of stem cells as demonstrated by pulse-chase 5-bromodeoxyuridine-labeling assay. This subset of telomerase-competent CPCs have long telomeres and, following activation, migrate to the regions of damage, where they generate a population of young cardiomyocytes reversing partly the aging myopathy. Thus, a senescent heart phenotype and HF may be corrected, and this may lead to prolongation of maximum lifespan. p66(Shc) longevity gene regulates both steady-state and environmental stress-dependent ROS generation and its deletion in mice protects against experimental diabetic glomerulopathy by preventing diabetes-induced OS [126] . The increasing oxygen toxicity that occurs in diabetes mellitus may affect CPCs function resulting in abnormal CPC growth and myocyte formation, which may favor premature myocardial aging and HF. Using a model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Rota et al. [127] reported that generation ROS leads to telomeric shortening, expression of the senescent associated proteins p53 and p16INK4a, and apoptosis of CPCs, impairing the growth reserve of the heart. Ablation of the p66shc gene prevents these CPCs negative adaptations, interfering with the acquisition of the heart senescent phenotype and the development of HF with diabetes. Low ROS levels activate cell growth, intermediate ROS levels trigger cell apoptosis, and high levels initiate cell necrosis. CPCs replication predominates in diabetic p66shc\u2212/\u2212, whereas CPC apoptosis, and myocyte apoptosis and necrosis prevail in diabetic wild type. Expansion of CPCs and developing myocytes preserves cardiac function in diabetic p66shc\u2212/\u2212, suggesting that intact CPCs can effectively counteract the impact of uncontrolled diabetes on the heart. The recognition that p66shc conditions the destiny of CPCs raises the possibility that diabetic cardiomyopathy is a stem cell disease, in which abnormalities in CPCs define the life and death of the heart. These data suggest a genetic link between diabetes and ROS and between CPC survival and growth.",

            "text": "Besides stem cells and myocytes, another critical component of the aging heart milieu is the cardiac fibroblasts, the predominant cell type in the heart. Fibroblasts activated by various autocrine and paracrine factors, such as angiotensin II (ANGII), aldosterone, endothelins, cytokines, and growth factors likely play a key role in the formation and maintenance of fibrous tissue by the production of various extracellularmatrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin, and integrin [129] . Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of fibrillar collagen in the extracellular space, in part arising as a loss of cardiomyocytes (replacement fibrosis) and as an interstitial response to various chronic cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, myocarditis, and severe HF (reactive fibrosis), and is generally considered to be elevated in the aging human heart [1, 130] . Collagen concentration (primarily collagen type 1) and the intermolecular cross-linking of collagen increase with age [131] ; however, being a rather complex process, the mechanisms of fibroblast involvement in aging-associated myocardial fibrosis remain undetermined. Surprisingly, both ANGII stimulation of collagen synthesis and fibroblast proliferation are diminished in aging compared to young cardiac fibroblasts [132] . Also, enzymes involved in the degradation of ECM components including the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-14 increased in concert with decreased insoluble collagen in aging mice, suggesting that the accumulated collagen and fibronectin are not attributable to aging-mediated decline in degradation [133, 134] . This suggests that the increased fibrosis and stiffness found in the aging heart must have another mechanism. For example, age-mediated changes in glycation and integrin kinase signaling may contribute to the accumulation of collagen cross-interactions and fiber bundling, which can lead to fibrosis [135, 136] . Increased fibrosis with age leads to increased diastolic stiffness and contractile dysfunction in the heart and its larger vessels, and can reduce the electrical coupling between cardiac myocytes resulting in nonuniform depolarization, conduction delays, and dysrhythmias. It is evident that excessive collagen deposition or pathological fibrosis is an important contributor to LV dysfunction and poor outcome in patients with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and HF.",

Observations on the structural changes of DHF have shown that DHF patients had stiffer cardiomyocytes, as suggested by a higher resting tension (F(passive)) at the same sarcomere length. Collagen volume fraction and F(passive) determined in vivo diastolic LV dysfunction. Correction of this high F(passive) by protein kinase A (PKA) suggests that reduced phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins is involved in DHF [137] . Cardiomyocytes of DHF patients had higher F(passive), but their total force is comparable to systolic heart failure (SHF). Cardiomyocyte diameter has been found to be higher in DHF [138] , but collagen volume fraction was equally elevated in both types of HF, with myofibrillar density lower in SHF. Cardiomyocytes in DHF patients had higher F(passive), but their total force was comparable to SHF. After administration of PKA to cardiomyocytes, the drop in F(passive) was larger in DHF than in SHF [138] . The data suggest that LV myocardial structure and function differ in SHF and DHF because of distinct cardiomyocyte abnormalities, and underline the separation of HF into two different phenotypes of SHF and DHF.",

Several mutations in fatty acid metabolism (e.g., ACADVL, carnitine transport), and in bioenergetic metabolism (e.g., NDUFV2, COX 15) and a number of mtDNA mutations have also been primarily identified in neonates and children. Interestingly, while the relationship between genotype and phenotype with HCM mutations is often not clear-cut, the distribution of specific mutations in elderly onset disease is often markedly different from specific mutations found in familial early onset HCM [139] . For instance, mutations in MYBPC3 encoding cardiac myosin binding protein-C, show delayed onset of HCM and induce the disease predominantly in the fifth or sixth decade of life and along with specific troponin I, and a-myosin heavy chain alleles are more prevalent in elderly onset HCM [140, 141] . Mutations which alter the charge of the encoded amino acid tend to affect patient survival more significantly than those that produce a conservative amino acid change [142] . The milder cardiac phenotype in many of the patients with elderly onset HCM genes is also consistent with the observation that HCM is frequently well tolerated and compatible with normal life expectancy, and it may remain clinically dormant for long periods of time with symptoms and initial diagnosis deferred until late in life [143] .",

            "text": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heterogeneous disease that often overlaps with inflammatory heart disease. Although in the majority of cases the etiology of DCM is unknown, microarray techniques, performed using endomyocardial biopsy specimens, may allow novel insights into the unique disease-specific gene expression that exists in end-stage cardiomyopathy of different etiologies presenting with HF. Importantly, expression profile analysis of DCM may facilitate its early detection and prognostic assessment. Recently, Ruppert et al. [149] characterized different types of DCM employing gene expression profiling of biopsied cardiac tissue with microarrays performed by hybridization of synthesized complementary DNA against a Lab-Arraytor60-combi microarray. One pattern of gene expression was consistent with DCM and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, and another with inflammatory heart disease. Additionally, the microarray data were confirmed by showing that DCM is associated with a reduced myocardial toll-like receptor 9 expression resulting from progressive loss of functional cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these findings demonstrated the utility and validity of microarrays from endomyocardial biopsy specimens to detect subclasses of DCM that do not differ histopathologically, but transcriptionally, from each other. Furthermore, the gene expression profile observed in these patients with DCM suggested ongoing immune activation. Haeidecker et al. have assessed individual risk of new-onset HF by analysis of transcriptome biomarkers using microarrays techniques [150] . From a total of 350 endomyocardial biopsy samples, they were able to identify 180 with idiopathic DCM. Patients with phenotypic extremes in survival were selected: 25 considered to have good prognosis (eventfree survival for at least 5 years) and 18 with poor prognosis (events (death, requirement for LVAD, or cardiac transplant) and showing within the first 2 years of presentation clinical HF). Forty-six overexpressed genes were identified in patients with good versus poor prognosis, of which 45 genes were selected by prediction analysis of microarrays for prognosis in a train set (n = 29) with subsequent validation in test sets (n = 14 each). Interestingly, the biomarker performed with 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity after 50 random partitions. These findings suggest that transcriptomic biomarkers may predict prognosis in patients with new-onset HF from a single endomyocardial biopsy sample. Moreover, and based on these findings, novel therapeutic targets for HF and cardiomyopathy might become possible. Kittleson et al. [151] , also using gene expression analysis of microarrays, have tested the hypothesis that nonischemic (NICM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) would have both shared and have distinct differentially expressed genes relative to normal hearts. Comparison of gene expression of 21 NICM and 10 ICM samples with that of six nonfailing (NF) hearts was carried out using Affymetrix U133A Gene Chips and significance analysis of microarrays. Compared with NF, 257 genes were differentially expressed in NICM and 72 genes in ICM. Only 41 genes were shared between the two comparisons, mainly involved in cell growth and signal transduction. Those uniquely expressed in NICM were frequently involved in metabolism, and those in ICM more often had catalytic activity. Novel genes, which were upregulated in NICM but not ICM included angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) suggesting that ACE2 may offer differential therapeutic efficacy in NICM and ICM. In addition, a tumor necrosis factor receptor was downregulated in both NICM and ICM, demonstrating the different signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of HF. Thus, transcriptome analysis offers novel insights into the pathogenesis-based therapies in HF management and complements studies using expression-based profiling to diagnose HF of different etiologies. In contrast, Kuner et al. [152] have reported poor separation of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies by genomic analysis. They analyzed one cDNA and two publicly available high-density oligonucleotide microarray studies comprising a total of 279 end-stage human HF samples. When classifiers identified in a single study were applied to the remaining studies, misclassification rates >25% for ICM and NICM specimens were noted, indicating poor separation of both etiologies. However, data mining of 458 classifier genes that were concordantly identified in at least two of the three data sets points to different biological processes in ICM vs. NICM. Consistent with the underlying ischemia, cytokine signaling pathways and immediate-early response genes were overrepresented in ICM samples, whereas NICM samples displayed a deregulation of cytoskeletal transcripts, genes encoding for the major histocompatibility complex, and antigen processing and presentation pathways, potentially pointing to immunologic processes in NICM. These data suggest that ICM and NICM exhibit substantial heterogeneity at the transcriptomic level. However, prospective studies will be necessary to test whether etiologyspecific gene expression patterns are present at earlier disease stages or in subsets of both etiologies.",

With aging the incidence of idiopathic DCM increases, males are afflicted at a higher rate than females and elderly patients have a worse prognosis than their younger counterparts with this disease.

Mutations in five other genes encoding sarcomere proteins have been implicated in DCM (all of which can also cause HCM) including b-MHC, cMyBP-C, cardiac troponin T, a-tropomyosin, and titin. While a subset of HCM patients develop a dilated phenotype, DCM resulting from sarcomeric gene mutations often arises without previous HCM. Mutations were subsequently described in genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins including desmin, d-sarcoglycan, muscle LIM protein, a-actinin-2, Cypher/Zasp, Tcap/telethonin and metavinculin, which stabilize the myofibrillar apparatus and link the cytoskeleton to the contractile apparatus. Dystrophin is another critical gene involved in the intracellular cytoskeleton (linking it to the ECM and contributing to intracellular organization, force transduction, and membrane stability), whose mutation can lead to DCM either in association with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or result in an adult-onset X-linked DCM without skeletal myopathy. Furthermore, mutations in gene-products serving critical electrophysiological function in the heart have been associated with DCM in a limited number of cases, including the ABCC9 gene encoding SUR2A, the regulatory subunit of the cardiac K ATP channel, and the SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel, involved in the generation of the action potential. Mutations in the phospholamban (PLN) gene encoding a transmembrane phosphoprotein which by inhibiting the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca 2+ -adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump is a critical regulator of calcium cycling, have also been found in individuals with DCM [155] [156] [157] . A T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), and resulting in loss-of-function mutation (PLN null allele) was identified in two families with hereditary HF; subjects homozygous for L39stop developed DCM and HF, requiring cardiac transplantation [156] .",

Clearly, the wide spectrum of defective intracellular functions that can lead to DCM suggests that multiple pathophysiological mechanisms are likely involved in triggering this disorder, consistent with its frequently heterogeneous presentation. A number of the aforementioned genetic defects are associated with late-onset DCM with higher incidence of presentation in the elderly. In a largescale mutation analysis of European patients with DCM, carriers of mutations in the b myosin heavy chain (MYH7) gene were significantly older (mean age at diagnosis was 48 years) compared to carriers of mutations in the cardiac T troponin (TNNT2) gene (mean age at diagnosis was 23 years) [159] . Also, several specific DCM-associated mutations are associated with a milder presentation and increased disease presen-tation with age. While mutations in the MyBP-C have been previously described in association with a favorable clinical course and with late onset HCM, late-onset DCM has been reported in association with an Arg820Gln mutation in the MyBP-C gene [160] .

Individuals with DMD usually have frameshift or nonsense DMD mutations that result in premature termination of translation, and a reduction or absence of dystrophin; typically, patients with DMD lack any detectable dystrophin expression in their skeletal muscles. In contrast, BMD is a milder, allelic form of DMD with affected males presenting later in life, exhibiting a milder course and displaying a high incidence of cardiac involvement, despite their milder skeletal muscle disease; the most common cause of death in BMD is HF. While clinical expression occurs primarily in the young adult, expression including severe DCM has also been reported in the older adult (>50 years old) [164, 165] . Subjects with BMD usually have DMD deletions that result in truncation or reduced levels of expression of dystrophin.

            "text": "Another connection between genes involved in DCM and aging phenotypes has emerged with the characterization of LMNA mutations affecting lamin A/C. In addition to a variety of laminopathies including DCM along with neuropathy, lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), and autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), mutations in LMNA can result in premature aging syndromes or progeria. LMNA mutations have been reported in segmental progerias: Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) [168] , and Atypical Werner Syndrome [169] . In these aging diseases, the age of onset is quite different. In sharp contrast to Werner Syndrome, which becomes apparent at or shortly after puberty and early adulthood, HGPS manifests early in childhood. Growth retardation can be observed by 3-6 months of age, with degenerative changes in cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems showing shortly thereafter; baldness occurs by age 2 and median age of death is 13.5 years with mortality primarily attributable to myocardial infarction or severe HF. While many of the diseases secondary to LMNA mutations arise from dominant missense mutations (e.g., DCM type 1A, LGMD) some are autosomal recessive (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and others sporadic (e.g., HGPS, EDMD). It is clear, although largely unexplained, that different mutations in the same gene can lead to diverse dysfunctions and limited phenotypic overlap, with specific tissues targeted in each pathology [170] . An important unanswered question is why defects in nuclear envelope proteins that are found in most adult cell types should give rise to pathologies associated predominantly with skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipocytes. Among three different LMNA-mediated myopathies (i.e., EDMD, DCM and LGMD), cardiomyopathy occurs with the underlying potential of sudden death because of cardiac dysrhythmia. Moreover, the cardiac disease of mutated LMNA is often defined by conduction system and rhythm disturbances occurring early in the course of the disease, followed by DCM and HF. Affected individuals of a family comprised of members heterozygous for the same single nucleotide deletion in exon 6 of the LMNA gene showed different presentations, one with LGMD, one with EDMD, and another with DCM. The intrafamilial variability and mutational pleiotrophy observed in this and other studies suggests that other modifying factors (genetic, environmental or epigenetic) likely influence phenotypic expression [171] .",

Other potential pathogenic mechanisms include loss or rearrangement of other LMNAassociated protein (e.g., emerin) and nuclear pore modifica-tion, changes in heterochromatin relative to the nuclear lamina, and altered gene expression due to disrupted interaction with RNA polymerases and transcription factors (this is further discussed in Chap. 6).",

Several of the infiltrative diseases resulting in RCM can be inherited, including familial amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, Gaucher's disease, and glycogen storage disease. Most of the congestive HF in the elderly is due to diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function suggesting that RCM is an important entity [174] . Amyloidosis is the most prevalent underlying cause of RCM [175] , and results from replacement of normal myocardial contractile elements by infiltration and interstitial deposits of amyloid, leading to alterations in cellular metabolism, Ca 2+ transport, receptor regulation, and cellular edema.

In earlyonset cases (i.e., patients younger than 50 years old), cardiac amyloid deposition was most prominent in the atrium and subendocardium but became evident throughout the myocar-dium in late-onset cases. The Tyr77 mutation, the second most prevalent TTR mutation was studied in a large family with 12 affected individuals over four generations; the clinical phenotype is characterized by (sometimes prolonged) carpal tunnel syndrome, beginning between the sixth and seventh decade, with subsequent RCM [177] . Moreover, different ethnic groups have been shown to have varying degrees of susceptibility to cardiac amyloid deposition, while other groups do not have cardiac involvement. Substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 122 of the TTR gene has been reported to be more prevalent in African-Americans (estimated to be present in approximately 4% of the black population) [178] , and is also associated with the occurrence of late-onset RCM [179] . Molecular analysis revealed that the substitution of isoleucine for valine shifts the equilibrium toward monomer (indicating lower tetramer stability), and favors tetramer dissociation required for amyloid fibril formation and resulting in accelerated amyloidosis [180] .",

            "text": "RCM can also be associated with an iron-overload cardiomyopathy that manifests systolic or diastolic dysfunction primarily attributable to increased cardiac of iron deposition, and occurs with common genetic disorders such as hemochromatosis [181] . While the precise mechanism of iron-induced HF is not clear, the toxicity of iron in biological systems has largely been attributed to its ability to catalyze ROS generation. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common autosomal recessive disorder among Caucasians with the genotype at risk accounting for 1:200-400 individuals of Northern European ancestry. Clinical complications appear late in life and often include cardiomyopathy (primarily but not necessarily restrictive) with subsequent development of congestive HF limited to homozygotes. As with many cardiomyopathies, phenotypic expression of the disease shows intrafamilial variability, likely as a result of the effects of modifier genes or to environmental factors. Hereditary hemochromatosis has been linked to pathogenic mutations in the gene coding for HFE, an atypical HLA class I molecule on chromosome 6 (6p21.3), hemojuvelin (HJV or HFE2) on chromosome 1 (most often associated with the juvenile form of hemochromatosis) and more rarely the gene coding for hepcidin (HAMP) on chromosome 19, and the gene encoding serum transferrin receptor 2 [181] [182] [183] . Two missense mutations in HFE have been found to be responsible for the majority of cases, C282Y and H63D; the C282Y mutation has a higher penetrance than the H63D mutation, and appears to result in a greater loss of HFE protein function [181] . Iron-overload in the heart resulting from HFE knockout in mice can also lead to increased susceptibility to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury as indicated by increased postischemic ventricular dysfunction, increased myocardial infarct size and myocyte apoptosis, with the degree of injury significantly elevated by high-iron diet [184] . While HFE mutations have been reported to be involved in several agerelated chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and CAD, one study suggested that in some populations the same HFE mutations associated with cardiomyopathy and CVDs paradoxically have also shown an increased prevalence (in the heterozygous state) in centenarians (primarily women), suggesting a beneficial role with respect to longevity [185] . This may be because individuals heterozygous for the C282Y mutation tend to have slightly but significantly higher values for serum iron and transferrin saturation and are therefore less likely to exhibit anemia secondary to iron deficiency; however, other studies have failed to replicate this relationship in different ethnic groups [186, 187] .",

This difference in the pathophysiology of the disease in aging may explain why the survival benefits seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and b-blockers in younger adult are reduced in older people, particularly older women [189, 190] . Finally, the primary goal of the pharmacogenomics of HF, should be to increasingly effectuate a personalized medicine defining the most effective treatment plan (e.g., drug regimens and dosage) to treat disease in patients of specific genetic backgrounds, and ages.
