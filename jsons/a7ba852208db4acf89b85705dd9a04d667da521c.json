The ubiquitous nature of Norovirus necessitates simple and rapid detection methods with high accuracy and sensitivity. To this end, several investigators have evaluated the usefulness of commercial reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) kits for detecting Norovirus genogroups I (GI) and II (GII). In previous studies, the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII showed a relatively high detection rate, while that for Norovirus GI showed a relatively low detection rate. In the present study, clinical Norovirus specimens were used to compare the detection rate of a modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI with the rates of the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI and an ''in-house'' RT-LAMP GI primer set, methods which had a high detection rate. Results from the present study showed that the modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI had a higher detection rate for two viral genotypes (GI.3, GI.11). On comparison with an ''in-house'' GII primer set using genotype GII.4 viruses circulating recently, the detection rate by the Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII was found to be higher, with a 98% detection rate. These results indicate the applicability of the modified LAMP kit for GI and the conventional LAMP kit for GII for detection of Noroviruses in clinical samples.",

Norovirus, a member of the genus Norovirus, in the family Caliciviridae, is considered to be a common cause of outbreaks and sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis among all age groups. Transmission occurs by ingestion of contaminated food or water, exposure to contaminants (fomites, aerosolized vomitus), and person-toperson contact. Known to have high transmissibility and a low infectious dose, Norovirus has been recognized as the primary source of outbreaks in a range of environments, including nursing homes, hospitals, schools, hotels, and cruise ships [Vinje and Koopmans, 1996; Cheesbrough et al., 2000; Hedlund et al., 2000; Marks et al., 2000; Pang et al., 2000; Johansson et al., 2002; Lopman et al., 2002; Marks et al., 2003] .

A rapid and simple diagnostic kit based on immunochromatography which was developed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant Norovirus capsid was found to be predominantly type-specific.

Further, the detection rates for two particular GI genotypes (GI.3 and GI.11) were higher with the modified kit and OPH primer set than with the conventional kit.

This discrepancy may be due to an excess of copies of the Norovirus genome in most of the clinical specimens (Table I) . The detection limit reported by Pang et al. [2004] was 25,000 copies of RNA transcripts per gram of stool for Norovirus GII and 2.5 \u00c2 10 7 copies/g of stool for Norovirus GI. If RNA extraction is 100% efficient, 8000 copies/tube would be equivalent to 1 \u00c2 10 7 copies/g of stool. Further, the sequence of the OPH GI primer set matches the target region of GI.4 better than the conventional Eiken GI kit, leading to higher detection rates (Table I) . However, only highly sensitive GI detection kits could detect GI.4 Norovirus in certain mixed infection cases due to the small number of the Norovirus copies (Table III) .",

This difference in detection rate was due to poor reactivity of the OPH mixed primer set towards the commonly circulating GII.4. The detection rates of the Eiken GII kit and the OPH mixed primer set for GII.4 were 98% and 78%, respectively. The high detection sensitivity (98%) of the Eiken GII kit for the common circulating GII.4 was in good agreement with the 100% detection rate reported previously [Iturriza-Gomara et al., 2008] . Although, the sensitivity for detecting GII.4 genotype of Norovirus was the same between the conventional GII kit and the ''in-house'' prevalent GII primer set [Yoda et al., 2007] , the sensitivity for detecting GII.4 strains might be decreased with mixed primer sets due to interference of the primers [i.e., mixed prevalent GII primer set (12 primers) and minor GII primer set (15 primers)]. However, the reduced detection rate for GII.4 Norovirus in 2 years (88-73% in 2006-2007) indicated the emergence of mismatch between OPH mixed primer set and the circulating GII.4 strains. Because of the high sensitivity for detecting the GII.4 genotype, the conventional GII kit but not the OPH GII primer set might be able to detect GII Norovirus in GI.5 and GII.4 mixed infections (Table IV) .",
