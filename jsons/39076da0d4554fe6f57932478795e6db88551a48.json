Panleucopenia is a highly infectious and ubiquitous disease and affects not only the domestic cat but also other members of the Felidae (for example tigers, cheetahs and leopards), the Mustellidae (mink and skunk), Procyonidae (e.g. coati mundi, racoon) and Viverridae (binturong) (Povey, 1976) . It is unlikely that the presence of the disease in these other species has any significant impact on the life cycle of the virus in the domestic cat, because the domestic cat is far more likely to be exposed to the virus from another domestic cat or its environment. The morbidity of FP in a susceptible population will rapidly approach 100 per cent, because it is so highly infectious. Although cats of most ages may be affected, it is primarily a disease of young kittens who succumb when their maternal antibody has waned. In most cases, natural exposure results in a lifelong immunity to the disease. Not all infected cats, however, will show severe clinical signs; in some the disease will only be mild or subclinical. In some areas, the disease appears to have more of a seasonal incidence, with peaks occurring in the summer and early autumn. These appear to coincide with appearance of large numbers of susceptible kittens as a result of a seasonal pattern to the birth rate (Gillespie & Scott, 1973; Reif, 1976) .",

Biting and flying insects, such as fleas, have also been suspected of mechanically transmitting FP, but it seems very unlikely that they play a major r6le in the epidemiology of the disease. Transplacental infection certainly occurs with FP virus, and, indeed, is not surprising in view of the affinity of the virus for actively dividing cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , it has been postulated that infection early on in pregnancy will result in early foetal death and resorption, whereas later on (from the middle third of gestation to immediately post-natally), it has been shown that it will result in the cerebellar hypoplasia/ataxia syndrome with in-coordination that may be seen in young kittens (Kilham et a/., 1967; Csiza et al., 1972) . Viral persistence. FP virus is perpetuated in the cat population in three main ways. First, by contact spread from acutely infected clinical cases to susceptible cats, given that there are a sufficient number of susceptibles in the population and sufficient opportunities for contact between them. Secondly, FP virus can persist in the recovered cat because of the existence of immune carriers. The recovered clinical case may harbour virus in its tissues for several months; indeed, in the tissues of ataxic kittens and in the faeces of mink, the virus has been shown to persist for up to a year (Bouillant & Hanson, 1965 . However, persistence of virus in these immune carriers is probably not particularly important -far more significant in the epidemiology of FP is the remarkable ability of the virus to survive in the environment. Most practitioners will be familiar with the difficulties of eradicating canine parvovirus from infected premises. FP virus is also extremely stable being resistant to heat and many disinfectants; it may persist in infected premises for up to a year (Johnson, 1966 (Johnson, , 1969 : Scott (1980) reporting on 27 products tested at the manufacturers' recommended concentrations found that only three solutions (Clorox, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde) had sufficient virucidal activity against FP virus.",

In kittens born to immune queens there is a high correlation between antibody titres in the queens and xquired passive immunity levels in their kittens (Scott et al., 1970) .

For FCD, however, where generalization of the virus infection is far more common, it is possible that the virus may on occasions cross the placenta; occasionally, FC V has been isolated from an aborted foetus Ellis, 1981) . Viral persistence. Unlike FP, where because of the stability of the virus outside the host, a contaminated environment constitutes a major source of virus to the cat, the feline respiratory viruses are relatively fragile outside the cat (FVR virus surviving for (18 hours, FCV <8-10 days, depending on the temperature and relative humidity) and are susceptible to heat, drying and most common disinfectants (Povey & Johnson, 1970; Scott, 1980) . They must therefore rely heavily for their continued survival on their ability to survive inside the cat. They do this in two ways (Fig. 2) . First, by spreading from acutely infected clinical cases to susceptible cats, as outlined for FP. Secondly, they both have the ability to induce an immune carrier state in recovered animals (Gaskell & Wardley, 1978) . Such animals are of great epidemiological importance, not only because they are undoubtedly infectious to in-contact cats but because the carrier state in both these diseases is a very widespread phenomenon. Studies have shown that at least 80 per cent of FVR-recovered cats remain as viral carriers (Gaskell & Povey, 1973 . In colonies where FCV is endemic, up to 40 per cent of the animals have been shown to be viral carriers .",

Both modified live and inactivated systemic vaccines are available and also modified live vaccines given by the intranasal route. However, there may be some problems associated with trying to control feline respiratory disease through vaccination alone. This has been reviewed in more detail elsewhere (Gaskell, 1981) , but basically problems arise because the viruses are highly infectious and widespread in the population, and they persist for a long time in infected cats as a high proportion of animals remain as viral carriers. Despite vaccination it is probable that such animals can still be a source of infectious virus. Furthermore, for both FVR and FCD there is evidence that a previously unexposed cat vaccinated intramuscularly may subsequently become a virulent field virus carrier following challenge, without ever having shown any clinical signs (Orr et al., 1978; Gaskell et aZ., 1982) . Such animals are clearly of epidemiological importance and could initiate outbreaks in young kittens, at the stage at which they lose their passive immunity, in colonies where the disease is endemic. Thus vaccination should be regarded as protection against disease for the individual rather than protection against infection. There is some evidence that the intranasal vaccination of previously unexposed animals may protect against the establishment of a field virus carrier state, at least in the short term, though it is not clear from these studies if such animals could withstand repeated challenge from field virus after longer periods of time (Orr et al., 1980) .",

However, the infectivity of the agent, or perhaps more accurately the outcome of infection, appears to be related to the infecting dose of virus and the duration of contact between the animals (Jarrett, 1979) . Thus, free range cats, which are probably only transiently exposed to a low dose of infecting virus, tend to become immunized to FeLV and rarely become persistently infected or develop FeLV-related diseases. In closed colony cats, however, susceptible animals are often in prolonged, intimate contact with excreting cats and thus the dose of virus to which they are exposed is high. Although the majority of animals in such a situation do also recover from the infection, 30-40 per cent of them do not manage to eliminate the virus, become persistently viraemic, and have a high risk of developing FeLV-related diseases (Jarrett, 1979) . One might speculate that if man had not interfered with the lifestyle of cats and forced them into high-risk closed colonies, only transient infections would tend to occur and we might not now see so many cats with FeLV-related diseases.",

Both groups of persistently infected cats are of great significance in the epidemiology of the disease, for they serve as a constant source of infectious virus.

            "text": "Infectivity. The natural infectivity of FIP virus is difficult to assess, mainly because of the recent realization that antibodies to FIP virus cross react with those to FECV (Pedersen, 1981) . In FIP problem catteries the disease incidence is usually relatively low (5-10 per cent) (Pedersen, 1976a) but until recently it was assumed that most of the animals in such colonies had been exposed to the virus because of the high proportion of cats with coronavirus antibody (Pedersen, 1976b; Loeffler et al., 1978; Horzinek & Osterhaus, 1979b) . However, until a serological test is developed that can distinguish antibodies to FIP and FECV, it is difficult to assess the infectivity of FIP under natural conditions. Under experimental conditions, the infectivity of FIP virus appears to depend on a number of factors, some of which remain to be elucidated. In general, however, and as assessed experimentally, the infectivity of FIP virus is not very high. Thus a proportion of experimentally infected animals often fail to become infected, as assessed by absence of seroconversion and disease, though to some extent this depends on the route of inoculation. Thus Pedersen and his co-workers (1981a) have noted a greater infectivity of tissue-culture propagated virus when administered intraperitoneally rather than on to a respiratory or oral mucosal surface. Other workers, however, have observed an apparently higher infectivity via the oral route (Evermann et al., 1981) . Such discrepancies may also be due to other factors, such as biological variation between isolates and perhaps some degree of attenuation on passage. It is possible that the infecting dose of virus may also play a role (Pedersen & Black, 1983) . Finally, infectivity appears to depend to some extent on the immune status of the host; successful infection occurs more readily in animals with pre-existing antibody to coronavirus than in sero-negative animals (Pedersen & Boyle, 1980; Pedersen et al., 198 la; Weiss & Scott, 1981) .",

Although it is evident, from the sporadic but continuous losses in colonies with FIP, that horizontal transmission of FIP does occur, the natural route of transmission is unknown. Experimentally, virus has been transmitted by a variety of parenteral routes including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intraperitoneal routes (Pedersen, 1976a; Evermann et al., 1981) and also via the oral and respiratory routes (Pedersen et al., 1981a; Evermann et al., 1981; Weiss & Scott, 1981) . Because the virus is present in the blood (Weiss & Scott, 198 l) , and is infectious by parenteral routes, transmission by blood sucking insects such as fleas may be possible (Pedersen, 1976a) . It has also been suggested from epidemiological observations that transplacental transmission might perhaps occur (Pastoret & Henroteaux, 1978) , but there is no definitive evidence to support this. Viral persistence. The low incidence (1 per cent) of FIP in the general cat population (Pedersen, 1981) makes it unlikely that virus is perpetuated by successive spread from acute clinical cases to susceptible animals, unless there is a high incidence of sub-clinical infection. In some catteries, where in rare cases morbidity can approach 25 per cent or more in the first 12 months (Pedersen, 1976a) , it is possible that continuous horizontal spread is responsible for perpetuating the virus.",

Experimentally, most animals either fail to become infected with the virus or die of FIP (Pedersen et al., 1981a) . Occasional animals show seroconversion without clinical disease and these animals presumably are the likely carriers (Pedersen, 1981) . Perhaps a situation exists, as in FeLV infection, whereby more persistent infections are created in susceptible animals in a pre-existing endemic colony situation because of continuous exposure to shedding carriers. Stress may play a r6le, perhaps in activating latent infections, as has been seen for both FVR and FeLV (Gaskell & Povey, 1973 Post & Warren, 1980) . FIP virus is rather labile and thus the environment is unlikely to be a long-term source of virus to the susceptible cat. It is inactivated within one day at room temperature whether it is dried or kept moist, and it is destroyed rapidly by heat and most commonly used disinfectants, although it is surprisingly resistant to phenol (Pedersen, 1976a, b) .",
