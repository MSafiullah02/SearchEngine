            "text": "The outbreaks of diseases can involve the diffusion of information in regard to the diseases, including the risk of infection, rumors, fears and so on, which can stimulate individuals to take spontaneous behavioral responses to protect themselves, thereby bring profound impacts on the spreading of disease [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. For example, recent outbreaks of the H1N1 flu, the bird flu, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have brought the reduction of going out and the plenty of people wearing face masks. For this reason, there has been an increasing focus on the development of formal models aimed at investigating the interplay of epidemic spreading and information-based behavioral responses [7], [8], [9], [10]. Such as, based on the assumption that the probability of susceptible individual going to the alter state is proportional to the number of infected neighbors, Sahneh et al., extended the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model to a Susceptible-Alter-Infected-Susceptible (SAIS) model [11], [12], and they found that the way of behavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold; Meloni et al. studied a meta-population model that incorporates several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals, and they found that such behavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold, but may produce a negative impact on disease, i.e., the density of infection is increased [13]; In Refs. [14], [15], [16], authors investigated the effects of the information-based behavioral responses on the epidemic dynamics by designing the transmission rate as a function of the local infected density or the global infected density.",

As we know, with the development of technology, information can fast diffuse through many different channels, such as, the word of mouth, news media, online social networks, and so on. In view of this, recent well-studied multiplex network theory has been used to mimic the interplay of information or related awareness and the epidemic dynamics [17], [18], [19], [20]. For instance, Sahneh et al., have shown that the information dissemination spread in another network can help boost the resilience of the agents\u2019 population against the spreading and found optimal information dissemination for different topologies [21]; Wang et al., investigated the interplay of the epidemic dynamics and the information dynamics in multiplex network based on the SIR (R-recovery) model, and focused on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final epidemic prevalence [22]; Granell et al., established an SIS-UAU model to investigate the competing effects of the spreading of awareness and the epidemic dynamics in multiplex with the transmission rate of awareness as well as the structure of information network [23]. More recently, they further generalized their model by reducing the probability of infected individuals becoming awareness and including the effect of a mass broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the epidemic dynamics [24].",

In reality, individuals may become aware (i.e., self-initiated awareness) when they find that their neighbors are infected. Inspired these factors, in the current work, we study the interplay between the diffusion of awareness by incorporating the self-awareness effects and the epidemic dynamics under the framework of multiplex network. In the model, an infectious disease first spreads among population represented by the contact network, and then the outbreak of the disease stimulates some people (infected or susceptible individuals) become aware of the risk of infection, and they take some protections to reduce the probability of infection. Meanwhile, unaware individuals can be informed by other aware individuals through the information network or become self-awareness induced by the infected neighbors in contact network or mass media. The finding indicates that the additional self-initiated awareness mechanism can reduce the density of infection, however, which can not alter the epidemic threshold. Moreover, we show that since the hub nodes in information networks are easier to be informed, which can much lower their infection probability in contact networks. The results are verified by the Monte-Carlo simulations and the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA).",

In that model, a multiplex network includes two layers, one is physical layer representing the spreading of epidemic (contact network), and the other is information layer on where the diffusion of the awareness evolves (information network). All nodes represent the same individuals in both layers, but the connectivity is different in each of them. In the contact layer, a Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible (SIS) model is used to mimic the epidemic dynamics. That is to say, a susceptible node can be infected by one infected neighbor with certain probability, and the infected node can return to susceptible state with probability \u03bc. On the information layer, the dynamical process of awareness is assumed to be similar to the SIS model, that is, an unaware node (U) can be informed by an aware neighbor (A) with probability \u03bb, and the aware node can loss awareness and back to unaware state with probability \u03b4. The interplay of the two processes is modelled as follows: once an individual is infected, s/he will certainly become aware, that is, the probability is \u03c3=100%. In addition, to distinguish the protective behaviors between the aware individuals and unaware individuals, let \u03b2 and \u03b2A=\u03b3\u03b2 (here 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < 1. If \u03b3=0, the aware individuals are completely immune to the infection.) be the probabilities of unaware and aware susceptible nodes to get infected, respectively.",

As we know, in many cases, infected individuals are unwilling to tell others since they can be discriminated or isolated by others once others know they are infected by one certain disease. For example, if one person is infected by AIDS or hepatitis B, who may be alienated by his friends. So we assume that infected individuals becoming aware with probability 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1. On the other hand, in the model, individuals can only be informed by their neighbors through the information network, that is to say, one individual has no chance to become aware once their neighbors are unaware. However, individuals can become self-awareness once their friends are infected or they are informed by the mass media, and the probability of becoming awareness increases with the number of infected people [12]. Thus, in our model, we assume that, for a susceptible individual, besides being informed by the aware neighbors in the information network, which can also self-awareness when contacting one infected neighbors in contact network, the probability is represented by parameter \u03ba. Note that, for the original model in Ref. [23], awareness cannot break out if the probability \u03c3=0, so the roles of awareness cannot be played, however, in our model, the awareness can diffuse among population even though \u03c3=0 since susceptible individuals can become aware by their self-initiated responses.",

Observing the figure, one can see that though the larger value of \u03ba can cause more individuals become aware and reduce the density of infection. However, one can find that the increasing of \u03bb has no influence on the epidemic threshold. The result is remarkably different from many previous results which claim that the local information-based behavioral response in the single-layer network can alter the epidemic threshold. For instance, Wu et al., [14] compared the roles of the three forms of information-based awareness, i.e., local, global, and contact awareness, in the epidemic threshold, and concluded that global awareness cannot alter the epidemic threshold while both local awareness can enhance the epidemic threshold. Sahneh et al., [11], [12] and us also illustrated that the local information based behavioral responses can effectively increase the epidemic threshold, no matter of SIS model or SIR model [16].",

When the epidemic has not broken out, the density of awareness in information network (i.e., \u03c1A) is only determined by the transmission rate of awareness, \u03bb, recovery rate \u03b4 and the structure of information network, but is not related to the value of \u03ba. Namely, near or below the epidemic threshold point, increasing the value of \u03ba only means that the initial number of the aware individuals is increased, which cannot affect the density of aware individuals at stationary state. In this case, the value of piA is independent of the value of \u03ba or \u03c3, which gives rise to the same value of \u03c1A [see Fig. 4(b)]. Thus, according to Eqs. (13) and (15), the epidemic threshold \u03b2c is invariable owing to the same value of \u03c1A. It is worth noting that, for the case of single-layer network, the local information-based behavioral response directly reduce the transmission rate of epidemic, leading to the change of the epidemic threshold. For our model, the self-awareness behavior first diffuses through the information network, and then play roles in the epidemic dynamics through the contact network. Thus, the effect of the awareness behavior on the transmission rate is indirect.",

From Fig. 7(a), one can observe that, when \u03bb=0.0 and \u03ba=0.0 (in this case, the awareness cannot diffuse in information network), the value of \u03c1kI is very large and increases to a stable value finally. However, when \u03bb is increased, the information can better diffuse in information network (see Fig. 7(b)), as a result, the value of \u03c1kI is totally reduced. Moreover, Fig. 7(b) suggests that larger value of \u03bb causes that the hub nodes in information networks have higher probability of being informed (i.e., larger value of \u03c1kA), which gives rise to the value of \u03c1kI is not very large even for large degree k (see Fig. 7(a)).",

In this situation, as shown in Fig. 8, even these hub nodes have more chances to be informed, they still have larger probability of being infected, thus, the effect of the information network cannot be well presented. In the next, we first construct a regular random network with degree k=8 for each node, which is constructed by random link rewiring from a regular network such that the degree of each node remains unchanged. In particular, a pair of edges, A\u2212B and C\u2212D, are randomly selected. They are then rewired to generate new link pairs A\u2212D and B\u2212C. Multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes are prohibited. The process continues for pE steps, where E is the number of edges in the network and p characterizes the randomness of the network. The information network is a configuration network with degree distribution P(k)\u223ck\u22122.5. Fig. 8\nreports the values of \u03c1kI and \u03c1kA as a function of degree k (Note: here the node\u2019s degree refers to the information network rather the contact network, since each node has the same degree in contact network). In this figure, we can clearly find that the nodes with larger degree in information network have larger value of \u03c1kA, leading to smaller value of \u03c1kI. That is to say, if a node has more neighbors in information network, who can reduce the risk of infection in contact network.",

By introducing the self-awareness mechanism for susceptible individuals, we have investigated interplay between the spreading of epidemic and the diffusion of awareness based on the framework of the multiplex networks. We mainly studied the two parameters \u03ba and \u03c3 characterizing the self-awareness probability of susceptible individuals and infected individuals, respectively. Analysis based on the Markov chain approach as well as the extensive computations reveal that the density of infection can be reduced once the two parameters are increased, however, we found that the impact of self-awareness behavior for susceptible individuals on inhibiting the spreading of epidemic is significantly better than the self-awareness of the infected individuals, since self-awareness from susceptible individuals can directly reduce their probabilities of being infected. Meanwhile, we found that the self-awareness behavior cannot alter the epidemic threshold no matter of the local or global information, which are in stark contrast with the results obtained from the single-layer networks. In addition, our findings have shown that the introduction of information layer may cause some individuals has more chances to be informed, which can greatly reduce their risks of infection.",
