But they all have kept the new infection numbers low, including China, the world most populous country. China's situation could have been far worse. COVID-19 hit at the time of Chinese New Year, when millions travel across the country for big gatherings and celebrations with families and friends. The extreme measures of lockdowns, large-scale suspension of business and schools, and strict stay-at-home orders, though not sustainable long-term and at an enormous economic cost, have brought COVID-19 outbreak under control and saved thousands of lives.",

The infections initially seemed to be limited compared to the outbreak in Italy. But by mid-March more than 5,000 cases were confirmed and the number was doubling by days.3 It became clear by then that COVID-19 infections were gaining ground and the U.S. had gone past the point of no return. As of April 27, 2020, the U.S. has the highest number of the global COVID-19 pandemic with more than 980,000 confirmed cases and 55,735 deaths that bring the death rate to 169 deaths per million population. In comparison, all five Asian countries have fewer than 5 deaths per million.2\n(\nTable 1\nabout here).",
