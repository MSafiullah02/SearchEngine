After its first emergence in the late 1970s, CPV-2 underwent a rapid evolution and the original type was replaced in the field by two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b, which suddenly spread to the canine population worldwide (Truyen, 2006). A third variant, CPV-2c, was identified in 2000 in Italy (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) and was subsequently found in other European countries, as well as in Asia, America and Africa (Greene and Decaro, in press).",

In-house tests are available for in-practice diagnosis of CPV infection, but those methods have been shown to be poorly sensitive when compared to methods based on nucleic acid amplification (Desario et al., 2005, Schmitz et al., 2009). In addition, ELISA-based assays can detect all CPV variants without remarkable differences (Decaro et al., 2010). Increasing concerns have been expressed on the actual efficacy of vaccines based on the old CPV-2 type against field strains, chiefly against the new variant 2c (Pratelli et al., 2001a, Cavalli et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2008), as several CPV outbreaks are being observed worldwide in dogs vaccinated regularly (Decaro et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2009, Calderon et al., 2009).",

Except for the hypervirulent CCoV strains (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008), CCoV is usually regarded as a mild canine pathogen, since it can frequently be detected in dogs with no overt clinical signs (Schulz et al., 2008). However, CCoV may also cause severe diarrhoea and exacerbate diseases caused by other canine viruses, such as CPV (Pratelli et al., 1999, Decaro et al., 2006c) and canine adenovirus (Pratelli et al., 2001b, Decaro et al., 2007a). Although recording the complete anamnesis of diarrhoeic dogs was beyond the scope of the present study, it would have been of interest to assess whether mixed infections affected the severity and outcome of the disease. Inactivated vaccines are available in Europe and can be used to confer some protection against CCoV, thereby reducing the effects of mixed infections (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008). Since inactivated vaccines can protect dogs from CCoV-induced disease but not from infection, modified live virus vaccines administered oronasally have been proposed as a reliable alternative (Pratelli et al., 2004).",

Nevertheless, the presence of particular CPV variants and/or CCoV genotypes is reported here for the first time in some countries and this is relevant in terms of the potential efficacy of current vaccines. Since there were no remarkable differences in the vaccination protocols among the various countries, the differences in epidemiological findings are most likely related to different trading flows of the dogs imported from foreign countries rather than to vaccination protocols (Decaro et al., 2007b). For instance, it is known that there is a prosperous trade of purebred pups between Eastern and Western European countries, and this may lead to the introduction and spread in a na\u00efve country of novel virus strains (Decaro et al., 2007a, Martella et al., 2007). However, it cannot be ruled out that some differences in the distribution of virus variants/genotypes are due to a sampling bias, at least for the countries where the number of samples was low.",
