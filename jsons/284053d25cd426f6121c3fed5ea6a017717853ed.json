Pan, X. Tian, P. Qin, B. Wang, et al., Vet Microbiol 211:15-21, 2017). SeACoV was later referred to as swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) by another group (P. Zhou, H. Fan, T. Lan, X.-L. Yang, et al., Nature 556:255-258, 2018). The present study was set up to investigate the potential species barriers of SADS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that SADS-CoV possesses a broad species tropism and is able to infect cell lines from diverse species, including bats, mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, pigs, chickens, nonhuman primates, and humans. Trypsin contributes to but is not essential for SADS-CoV propagation in vitro. Furthermore, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with the virus via oral or intraperitoneal routes. Although the mice exhibited only subclinical infection, they supported viral replication and prolonged infection in the spleen. SADS-CoV nonstructural proteins and double-stranded RNA were detected in splenocytes of the marginal zone on the edge of lymphatic follicles, indicating active replication of SADS-CoV in the mouse model. We identified that splenic dendritic cells (DCs) are the major targets of virus infection by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry approaches. Finally, we demonstrated that SADS-CoV does not utilize known CoV receptors for cellular entry. The ability of SADS-CoV to replicate in various cells lines from a broad range of species and the unexpected tropism for murine DCs provide important insights into the biology of this bat-origin CoV, highlighting its possible ability to cross interspecies barriers.",

Recently, a novel bat-HKU2-like CoV named swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) has emerged in southern China, causing lethal diarrhea in newborn piglets. It is important to assess the species barriers of SADS-CoV infection since the animal hosts (other than pigs and bats) and zoonotic potential are still unknown. An in vitro susceptibility study revealed a broad species tropism of SADS-CoV, including various rodent and human cell lines. We established a mouse model of SADS-CoV infection, identifying its active replication in splenic dendritic cells, which suggests that SADS-CoV has the potential to infect rodents. These findings highlight the potential crossspecies transmissibility of SADS-CoV, although further surveillance in other animal populations is needed to fully understand the ecology of this bat-HKU2-origin CoV.",

However, this replication in the large intestine did not translate into higher shedding, as hardly any viral genomes were detected, even at 1 dpi in the fecal samples collected from i.p.-infected mice (Fig. 3F ).

A monoclonal antibody against double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was used to identify cells that supported active virus replication, as dsRNA is an intermediate that only exists during intracellular viral replication. SADS-CoV dsRNA signals were observed in the splenic white pulp in the marginal zone on the edge of lymphatic follicles and in the margins of the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheath (Fig. 4A ). Staining of tissue sections from mock-infected mice were used as a control (Fig. 4B ). In addition to dsRNA, we also used rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to detect the expression of the viral structural protein (M) or nonstructural protein (Nsp3-AC). At 3 dpi, anti-M or anti-AC staining was observed in the white pulp around the lymphatic nodules (Fig. 4C) , similar to the localization of dsRNA staining (Fig. 4A ). Tissue sections from SADS-CoV or mockinfected mice probed with preimmune sera were negative, indicating the specificity of the SADS-CoV antibody.

We inoculated B6 wild-type mice with 5 \u03eb 10 5 TCID 50 of virus either i.p. or p.o. and extracted the bulk immune cells from the spleen of infected animals at 3 dpi. The flow cytometry method was first validated in Vero cells infected with SADS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, followed by staining with a pAb against the N or AC protein at 24 hpi (Fig. 4D ). As the anti-AC pAb exhibited optimal intracellular staining for viral signals (Fig. 4D) , it was used to determine the percentage of infected splenocytes. There were approximately 1.5-and 2.5-fold increases of total splenocytes positive for virus replication after p.o. and i.p. inoculation, respectively (Fig. 4E , left; Fig.  4F ), with a significant increase in the total number of AC-positive splenocytes in i.p.-infected mice compared with that of p.o. (Fig. 4E , right). These data are consistent with the significantly lower viral loads in the spleen at 1 and 3 dpi in p.o.-inoculated mice (Fig. 3D ), suggesting better virus dissemination and replication and escape from mucosal immune clearance. We then evaluated the growth characteristics of SADS-CoV in splenocytes by assessing antigen production and replication kinetics ex vitro. Splenocytes were first extracted from naive mice, plated in 100-mm dishes, and infected with 1 \u03eb 10 5 TCID 50 of SADS-CoV. We observed clusters of infected cells that appeared to have been engulfed by phagocytes (Fig. 4G , middle), and the structural N protein was shown in the cytoplasm of infected cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4G , middle and right). The percentage of infected cells was quantified by flow cytometry using anti-AC pAb, revealing a nearly 2-fold increase in the splenocytes positive for viral signals (Fig. 4H) , very similar to the percentage of infection observed in vivo. To further characterize the growth kinetic of SADS-CoV in primary splenocytes, cells were infected with 1 \u03eb 10 5 TCID 50 of SADS-CoV, and culture supernatants were harvested at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. Active viral replication was confirmed, with a 1.5-log time-dependent increase in genomic RNA equivalents, plateauing from 24 to 72 hpi (Fig. 4I ). These data suggest that although only \u03f32% of splenocytes were infected, and these cells supported a decent level of viral replication. Together, these results indicate that SADS-CoV productively infects mouse splenocytes.",

In order to test this hypothesis, it was first necessary to find a cell line that was refractory to infection only at the internalization step. MDCK cells, which showed undetectable virus production in early infection tests ( Fig. 1 and 2) , were chosen as a potential candidate. There are four known types of functional CoV protein receptors, including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV (18), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV (19) , aminopeptidase N (APN) for TGEV (20) and PDCoV (21, 22) , and mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (23) . To test whether one of these molecules serves as the SADS-CoV receptor, we attempted to inoculate nonsusceptible MDCK cells overexpressing porcine APN, human DPP4, mouse CEACAM1a, or human ACE2 with SADS-CoV, but none of them allowed infection, as staining with anti-SADS-CoV-N pAb was negative (Fig. 6A) . Meanwhile, the expression of each receptor in MDCK cells was confirmed by IFA (Fig. 6A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B) using antibodies against the tags fused to the receptors. We confirmed that, as positive controls, lentiviruses pseudotyped with TGEV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or MHV spike (i.e., pseudoviruses) efficiently entered MDCK cells exogenously expressing the respective receptors (Fig. 6C) .",

Moreover, passaging of supernatants from pSEA-transfected MDCK cells onto fresh Vero cells resulted in progeny SADS-CoV infection, as evidenced by expression of the N protein (Fig. 6E) , indicating that MDCK cells can also support infectious SADS-CoV production without cell-to-cell spread. Therefore, SADS-CoV apparently does not utilize any of the known CoV receptors for cellular entry. The same conclusion was reached using HeLa cells overexpressing each of the four classical CoV receptors followed by SADS-CoV inoculation by Zhou et al.

In fact, experimental infection of neonatal piglets with a higher dose of purified SADS-CoV in our laboratory resulted only in mild diarrheal signs or subclinical infection (11) . Also, there was a lack of robust viral replication in the intestines during infection, and no tissue damage was detected throughout the intestines ( Fig. 3B and C) , reflecting the suboptimal infection by SADS-CoV in immunocompetent wild-type mice. On the contrary, the virus had more efficient replication within the spleen, which was reflected by a continuous detection of viral genomic RNA in the immune cells at all time points over a 28-day period (Fig. 3D) . The phenotype was also consistent with the replication kinetics in extracted splenocytes in vitro, in which viral genomic RNA peaked and plateaued at 72 hpi ( Fig. 4G and I) . These data collectively led to speculation that SADS-CoV favors splenic cells over other tissues. The most logical explanation for these tissue-specific discrepancies in virus replication is (i) target cells are more concentrated in the spleen and more sporadic in the intestine or (ii) splenic immune cells have enhanced expression of the unknown receptor(s) over intestinal cells. The animals were more susceptible to i.p. infection, resulting in higher virus replication in the distal section of the small intestine, large intestine, and spleen, and perhaps a delayed clearance of viral infection in the cecum (Fig. 3B to E) , suggesting the important role of mucosal immunity for controlling early infection in SADS-CoV in mice. It should be noted that mice (C57BL/6J mice in this study) may not be the optimal rodent species for SADS-CoV infection, as wild rats are more commonly seen in Chinese pig farms. In addition, other transmission routes may be considered. Recently, PDCoV has been shown to possibly spread via the respiratory route in addition to fecal-oral transmission (28) . Therefore, it will be interesting to try intranasal route for the inoculation in rats or the other rodent species to mimic SADS-CoV natural transmission in future studies.",

            "text": "Furthermore, this study gives us a novel inspiration that rodents may potentially serve as susceptible hosts for SADS-CoV in addition to bats and pigs. Of note, the species Rhinolophus bat \u2423-CoV HKU2, including SADS-CoV, possesses unique S genes closely related to the betacoronavirus (\u2424-CoV), in a manner similar to some globally distributed rodent \u2423-CoVs (11, 32, 33) , implying an unknown evolutionary connection between the bat \u2423-CoV HKU2 and rodent \u2423-CoVs. Under the field conditions of China, direct contact between pigs and flying bats is a low probability; however, rodents (especially rats) are frequently visible in the swine industry, causing great nuisance due to feed loss. It is possible that as bats prey on insects near pig facilities, they leave feces containing HKU2-like CoVs that contaminate pig feed, which is then eaten by pig and rodents that subsequently become carriers of SADS-CoV. Rats and mice are increasingly implicated as external vectors for a wide range of different pig pathogens, such as Lawsonia intracellularis (34) . Rodents not only spread pathogens but also harm the practitioners of the swine industry, as they are thought to be the major source of leptospirosis in pigs and piggery workers (35) . Future studies on identifying SADS-CoVpositive samples in rodents near pig farms are warranted to test this hypothesis.",

Briefly, each of the plasmids encoding TGEV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S proteins were cotransfected into 293T cells with pLenti-Luc-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and psPAX2 plasmids (kindly provided by Zhaohui Qian, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College) at a molar ratio of 1:1:1 by using polyethylenimine (PEI). The cells were fed with fresh medium in the next 24 h, and the supernatant media containing pseudovirions were then collected and centrifuged at 800 \u03eb g for 5 min to remove debris. To quantify S protein-mediated entry of pseudovirions, MDCK cells were seeded at about 25% to 30% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected with either pAPN-Flag, hDPP4-Flag, mCEACAM1a-Flag, hACE2-GFP (kindly provided by Zhaohui Qian) (38) , or the control backbone vector by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). The MDCK cells overexpressing each receptor were inoculated with 500 l of 1:1 diluted corresponding pseudovirions at 24 h posttransfection. At 40 hpi, cells were lysed at room temperature with 110 l of medium with an equal volume of Steady-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI). The cell lysates were also used to confirm the expression of each receptor by using Western blotting. Transduction efficiency was monitored by quantitation of luciferase activity using a Modulus II microplate reader (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). On the other hand, the MDCK cells overexpressing each receptor were inoculated with SADS-CoV (MOI, 1) at 24 h posttransfection. IFA was performed to test for SADS-CoV susceptibility using anti-N pAb. The replication competency of SADS-CoV in MDCK cells was further determined by a reverse genetics system. Development of a DNA-launched SADS-CoV (SeACoV) infectious cDNA clone (named pSEA) and rescue of SADS-CoV by transfection of cultured cells with pSEA followed by passaging on Vero cells have been described recently by our lab (24) .",
