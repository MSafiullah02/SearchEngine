HCV is a positive strand RNA virus and requires a set of nonstructural proteins (NS3, 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B) as well as cis-acting replication elements at the genome termini for amplification of the viral RNA. All nonstructural proteins are tightly associated with membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and induce vesicular membrane alterations designated the membranous web, harboring the viral replication sites. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B is the key enzyme of RNA synthesis. Structural, biochemical, and reverse genetic studies have revealed important insights into the mode of action of NS5B and the mechanism governing RNA replication. Although a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of RNA synthesis is still missing, a number of important viral and host determinants have been defined. This chapter summarizes our current knowledge on the role of viral and host cell proteins as well as cis-acting replication elements involved in the biogenesis of the membranous web and in viral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae (van Regenmortel et al. 2000) . The genome of HCV encompasses a single ~9,600 nts long RNA molecule containing one large open reading frame (ORF) that is flanked by nontranslated regions (NTRs), important for viral RNA translation, and replication. The 5\u2032NTR contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), enabling viral RNA translation in the absence of a cap structure. HCV proteins generated from the polyprotein precursor are cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into at least 10 different products (for further details see chapter \"Hepatitis C Virus Proteins: From Structure to Function\", this volume): core, envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, p7, and the nonstructural proteins (NS) NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Core to NS2 is primarily involved in the formation of infectious virus (see chapter \"Virion Assembly and Release\", this volume), whereas the nonstructural proteins NS3 to NS5B are primarily involved in viral RNA replication, forming the viral replication complex ), which will be the focus of this chapter. NS3 is a multifunctional protein, consisting of an aminoterminal protease domain required for processing of the NS3 to NS5B region (Bartenschlager et al. 1993 ) and a carboxyterminal helicase/nucleoside triphosphatase domain (Suzich et al. 1993; Kim et al. 1995) . NS4A is a cofactor that activates the NS3 protease function by forming a heterodimer (Bartenschlager et al. 1995) . The hydrophobic protein NS4B induces vesicular membrane alterations involved in RNA replication (reviewed in Gouttenoire et al. 2010a ). NS5A is a phosphoprotein capable of RNA binding Foster et al. 2010) , which seems to play an important role in regulating viral replication and assembly (Appel et al. 2008; Tellinghuisen et al. 2008; Masaki et al. 2008) . It exists in two phosphorylation variants (Tanji et al. 1995; Kaneko et al. 1994 ); a basally (hypo-)phosphorylated form (p56), which is supposed to be important for RNA replication (Appel et al. 2005b; Blight et al. 2000 ) and a hyperphosphorylated variant (p58), probably involved in assembly. NS5B is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HCV, the key enzyme of viral RNA synthesis (Behrens et al. 1996; Lohmann et al. 1997) .",

The minimal genetic unit necessary and sufficient for RNA replication has been defined by subgenomic replicons and encompasses the NTRs as well as the NS3 to 5B coding region (Lohmann et al. 1999a ). The first step of RNA synthesis generates a negative-strand genome, which serves as template for progeny positive-strand RNA that is produced in 5-to 10-fold excess. It is generally assumed that RNA synthesis of complementary strands initiates at the very 3\u2032terminus of the template strand by de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and that RNA replication involves a double-stranded RNA intermediate, although clear experimental proof for both assumptions is missing. The newly synthesized positive-strand RNA is either re-entering a new translation/replication cycle or is packaged into virions. This chapter summarizes (Quinkert et al. 2005) . Multiple copies of the nonstructural proteins serve as structural components of a vesicular structure, containing probably only one replication intermediate and several progeny positive strands. Only a minor subfraction of the nonstructural proteins is supposed to have a function in RNA synthesis.

Early pioneering EM-studies of liver tissue from infected patients and chimpanzees indicated that HCV, like other positive-strand RNA viruses, induced membrane alterations in infected hepatocytes (Jackson et al. 1979; Shimizu et al. 1990; Shimizu 1992) . Later it was shown that the expression of viral nonstructural proteins, particularly NS4B, indeed resulted in the induction of vesicle accumulations, which were designated the membranous web . These data were confirmed using cell lines harboring persistent subgenomic replicons (Gosert et al. 2003) . Immunofluorescence analysis of the localization of viral nonstructural proteins revealed an ER-like distribution with distinct dot-like structures in these replicon cells also co-localizing with newly synthesized viral RNA (Gosert et al. 2003) . At the ultrastructural level, these dot-like structures correspond to accumulations of vesicles, which stained positive for viral nonstructural proteins (Gosert et al. 2003) . It seems likely that individual vesicles within the membranous web represent the sites of viral RNA replication. Based on analogy with related viruses, it is furthermore assumed that the vesicles are invaginations from the ER membrane, which are connected with the cytoplasm by a small pore allowing the exchange of small membrane-impermeable molecules like nucleotides for RNA synthesis [Fig. 1b; (Welsch et al. 2009 )].",

CRCs and permeabilized replicon cells are capable of RNA synthesis in vitro and this process was shown to be resistant to treatment with proteases and nucleases (Quinkert et al. 2005; Miyanari et al. 2003; Targett-Adams et al. 2008) , as well as to Triton X-100 treatment at 4\u00b0C Shi et al. 2003) . These results suggested that viral replication complexes were protected by detergent resistant membranes, most likely resembling those vesicular structures indicated by the EM analysis. To allow access of nucleotides to the sites of RNA synthesis, these vesicles should contain an opening allowing access for nucleotides, but small enough to protect the replication sites from nucleases and proteases (Fig. 1b; Quinkert et al. 2005; Miyanari et al. 2003) . Protease and nuclease digests of CRCs (Quinkert et al. 2005) and in permeabilized replicon cells (Miyanari et al. 2003) furthermore demonstrated that all of the negative-strand RNA, ~50 % of the positive-strand RNA, but less than 5 % of the nonstructural proteins were protected, indicating that the majority of NS-protein copies seem not to be involved in the formation of replication sites. Based on these data, it was assumed that an active replication site contained only one copy of negative-strand RNA, which might be part of a double-stranded replication intermediate (Targett-Adams et al. 2008) , several copies of positive-strand RNA and 500-2,000 copies of nonstructural proteins [Fig. 1b (Quinkert et al. 2005) ].",

            "text": "This simplistic model of the HCV replication complex has been challenged in several ways by more recent studies. First, it was shown that the majority of membrane alterations found in HCV-infected cells were not single membrane vesicles, but more complex structures, shelled by two or more membranes and termed double-membrane vesicles (DMVs; Fig. 1c ) and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs) (Ferraris et al. 2010; Reiss et al. 2011) , similar to membrane alterations identified for coronaviruses (Knoops et al. 2008; Gosert et al. 2002) and picornaviruses (Belov et al. 2012) . HCV double-stranded RNA and nonstructural proteins have been found inside DMVs and DMV abundance clearly correlates with viral RNA replication (Ferraris et al. 2010; Romero-Brey et al. 2012) , arguing for a functional role of these structures. However, connections of the vesicles to the cytoplasm were rarely observed; therefore, it is not clear how nucleotides get into and newly synthesized RNA out of the DMVs. The simple \"ER-invagination model\" (Fig. 1b) that was convincingly shown for the related Dengue virus (Welsch et al. 2009 ) was furthermore challenged by three-dimensional reconstructions, demonstrating that DMVs originate from protrusions rather than invaginations of the ER, with the outer membrane connected by a neck to the ER membrane (Romero-Brey et al. 2012) . How this topology of DMVs can be linked to previous models of HCV and flavivirus replication sites (Welsch et al. 2009 ) is an open question. In case of picornaviruses, RNA replication takes place preferentially at complex single membrane structures originating from the cis-Golgi, which are later transformed into DMVs by membrane wrapping processes (Belov et al. 2012 ) with yet to be defined function. In case of SARS coronavirus, it has been suggested that active RNA replication occurs in circular single membrane structures known as convoluted membranes (Knoops et al. 2008) . DMVs probably originate from these replication sites and represent a final storage compartment to hide replication intermediates from recognition by the innate immune response (Knoops et al. 2008) . Similar models might be true for HCV, since DMVs are the dominant species of membrane alterations only at time points later than 16 h after transfection or infection (Paul et al. 2011; Romero-Brey et al. 2012 ).",

However, meanwhile, this term is used to generally subsume distinct membrane alterations induced by the HCV nonstructural proteins, containing the sites of viral RNA synthesis (Gosert et al. 2003) . The membranous web most likely originates from the ER, as indicated by ultrastructural studies, biochemical evidence and cellular marker proteins, partially co-localizing with the viral replication sites (Gosert et al. 2003; Egger et al. 2002; Miyanari et al. 2003; El Hage and Luo 2003; Romero-Brey et al. 2012 ). In addition, the early endosomal marker Rab5 has also been found to colocalize with viral NS proteins, suggesting that the formation of HCV replication sites engages several organelles (Stone et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, the morphology of the membranous web is not depending on RNA replication, but is solely driven by the nonstructural proteins NS3 to NS5B, presumably in concert with cellular factors, since no obvious differences have been found between ectopic protein expression models, cells harboring replicons or infected cells (Romero-Brey et al. 2012; Egger et al. 2002; Gosert et al. 2003; Reiss et al. 2011; Ferraris et al. 2010; Paul et al. 2011) .",

NS4B is predicted to contain four central transmembrane segments flanked by N-and C-terminal regions attached to the membrane by amphipathic \u03b1-helices (Lundin et al. 2003; Gouttenoire et al. 2009b; Gouttenoire et al. 2009a ) (see also chapter \"Hepatitis C Virus Proteins: From Structure to Function\", this volume). Recent studies have shown that NS4B can oligomerize, thereby probably forming the scaffold of membranous vesicles (Yu et al. 2006; Gouttenoire et al. 2010b; Paul et al. 2011) . Oligomerization is mediated by homotypic and especially heterotypic interactions involving the N-terminal amphipathic helix 2 and the C-terminus of the protein (Paul et al. 2011; Gouttenoire et al. 2010b) . Mutations residing in the NS4B C-terminal region that are impaired in NS4B self-interaction and expressed in the context of the NS3 to NS5B polyprotein indeed generate aberrant DMV structures, supporting the notion that DMVs play an essential role in RNA replication (Paul et al. 2011; Aligo et al. 2009 ). However, NS4B is not the only determinant of membranous web morphogenesis and more recent data show that also the sole expression of NS3/4A, NS5A, and even NS5B gives rise to distinct vesicular membrane rearrangements (Romero-Brey et al. 2012) , suggesting that the role of other nonstructural proteins in this process has been underrated. Interestingly, NS3/4A, NS4B, and NS5B induce single membrane vesicles, which are different from the DMVs and MMVs observed upon expression of the entire replicase module NS3-5B (Romero-Brey et al. 2012) . In contrast, only NS5A induced vesicles containing several lipid bilayers and occasionally vesicles containing a pair of membranes morphologically identical to DMVs (Romero-Brey et al. 2012 ). Although we currently do not understand the role of these DMVs in HCV replication, these novel data clearly indicate that morphogenesis of the membranous web is complex and engages a concerted action of several nonstructural proteins. NS4B might therefore serve as the major scaffold in this process, modulated mainly by NS5A with the help of NS3/4A and NS5B. A critical role of NS4B-NS5A interactions in web formation is also indicated by genetic studies (Paul et al. 2011 ) and by the physical interaction between NS3/4A and the C-terminal region of NS4B (Aligo et al. 2009 ).",

Recently, the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII\u03b1, PIK4CA, PI4KA) has been identified by several siRNA screens as a cellular protein essential for HCV RNA replication (Vaillancourt et al. 2009; Borawski et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Tai et al. 2009; Berger et al. 2009; Reiss et al. 2011 ). NS5A and NS5B interact with PI4KIII\u03b1 and activate its lipid kinase activity, giving rise to elevated intracellular phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels (Reiss et al. 2011; Berger et al. 2011) . Silencing of PI4KIII\u03b1 results in reduced DMV size and absence of MMV formation, suggesting that this enzyme is critically involved in web morphology (Reiss et al. 2011) , probably mediated by PI4P. More recent data, furthermore, suggest that PI4KIII\u03b1 modulates NS5A phosphorylation, by promoting p56 synthesis, which might regulate the structure of the HCV replication sites as well (Reiss and Lohmann unpublished data) .",

On the one hand, increased lipid levels might be required to generate the membrane proliferations necessary to form the HCV replication sites, on the other hand, they might be necessary for protein modifications. FBL2, for example, is a geranylgeranylated protein interacting with NS5A and geranylgeranylation was shown to be critical for HCV RNA replication .

            "text": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are also often found in ultrastructural studies of the membranous web (LDs, Fig. 1a , c). LDs are cellular storage organelles for neutral lipids surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer (Martin and Parton 2006) . HCV core (Barba et al. 1997; Moradpour et al. 1996; McLauchlan et al. 2002) and NS5A (Shi et al. 2002; Brass et al. 2002) are associated to LDs, because membrane attachment of both proteins is mediated by an amphipathic helix, capable of association with membrane mono-and bilayers. LDs are currently believed to play a central role in the coordination of viral RNA synthesis and virion morphogenesis by physically associating replication and assembly sites (Miyanari et al. 2007 ; reviewed in Bartenschlager et al. 2011 ; see also chapter \"Virion Assembly and Release\", this volume). An interaction of core and NS5A domain III, which is probably regulated by phosphorylation, has been shown to be critical for assembly of infectious virus, by recruiting both proteins to the same LDs (Appel et al. 2008; Tellinghuisen et al. 2008; Masaki et al. 2008) . Although core seems to be the main driver in recruiting the viral replication sites to LDs (Miyanari et al. 2007 ), viral double-stranded RNA has been found surrounding LDs also in the absence of core, suggesting an additional role of these organelles in RNA replication (Targett-Adams et al. 2008) .",

Indeed, DMVs induced by HCV share morphological similarities with autophagosomes and colocalize with autophagosomal markers in some studies (Ferraris et al. 2010; Guevin et al. 2010 ). However, the functional role of autophagy in the HCV life cycle is still controversially discussed (reviewed in Dreux and Chisari 2011). Silencing of autophagy components indeed impaired HCV replication, but only very early in infection and not in persistent replication (Dreux et al. 2009; Guevin et al. 2010) , suggesting an important role in translation of the viral RNA (Dreux et al. 2009 ), rather than in membranous web biogenesis. Autophagy has, furthermore, been discussed to be involved in subversion of innate immune responses against HCV (Ke and Chen 2011) and in production of infectious virus (Tanida et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "Most of our knowledge on the distinct contribution of viral proteins to viral RNA synthesis is based on biochemical studies and structural analyses of individually expressed and purified proteins, particularly NS5B. This has been complemented by reverse genetics using replicons or infectious virus, particularly to dissect the function of cis-acting elements (see also chapter \"Hepatitis C Virus RNA Translation\", this volume). However, requirements of RNA replication in cell culture are complex, involving polyprotein processing, membranous web induction, interaction of cis-acting RNA elements (CREs) with proteins, RNA synthesis, and so on. This entire process seems to involve several cis-functions mediated by proteins synthesized on their original template, indicated by the limited possibility to rescue lethal mutants by transcomplementation, which is currently only possible for distinct mutations in NS5A and NS4B (Appel et al. 2005a; Jones et al. 2009; Fridell et al. 2011) . Therefore, most mutations interfering with any step in the process of RNA synthesis will finally result in an abrogation of RNA synthesis, without providing further mechanistic insight. Some limited information into the complex interactions between nonstructural proteins has been gained by studies using intergenotypic chimeras (e.g. Binder et al. 2007 ) and by the selection of pseudoreversions, rescuing replication deficient mutants and thereby providing genetic evidence for functional interactions (e.g. Lindenbach et al. 2007; Paredes and Blight 2008) . Still, there are some major discrepancies between biochemistry and cell culture such as the promiscuity of viral proteins regarding template choice in vitro compared to the strict requirement for almost invariant cis-acting elements to allow RNA replication in cell culture. Biochemical studies on CRCs purified from replicon cells failed to close this gap. CRCs predominantly synthesize a single, full-length RNA product of predominantly positive polarity (Hardy et al. 2003a ) and probably also some negative-strand RNA (Ali et al. 2002) . RNA synthesis in this system requires at least helicase and polymerase activity as shown by specific inhibitors (Hardy et al. 2003a) , involves de novo initiation of RNA synthesis (Hardy et al. 2003a ) and gives rise to single-and double-stranded RNA products . However, inhibition of NS5B is mainly achieved by chain terminating nucleotides in this system (Migliaccio et al. 2003; Lai et al. 2003) , whereas several classes of allosteric nonnucleosidic inhibitors of NS5B and heparin failed to inhibit RNA synthesis (Ma et al. 2005) , suggesting that CRCs contain stable complexes of the replicase bound to its RNA template. Therefore, it has not been possible to feed exogenous templates into CRCs, which strongly limits their use in mechanistic studies. Furthermore, this system is not accessible to reverse genetics, since active replication in cell culture is a prerequisite of CRC production, thereby precluding the study of mutations affecting defined steps of RNA replication. We are therefore currently lacking adequate in vitro models to address more specific interactions between HCV nonstructural proteins and their specific template, particularly regarding the complex initiation of positive-and negative-strand RNA synthesis.",

This interaction encompasses 7-8 complementary nts in the loop regions and is essential for RNA replication (Friebe et al. 2005) . The position of SL3.2 can be moved into the 3\u2032NTR and complementarity between the loop sequences of SL3.2 and SL2 was shown to be more important than the precise sequence (Friebe et al. 2005) , arguing for a functional role of a pseudoknot structure at the 3\u2032end of the genome. More recent studies suggest that the bulge region of SL3.2 can form an independent alternative pseudoknot structure with upstream sequences around nucleotide 9,110 (Diviney et al. 2008; Tuplin et al. 2012) . Since both interactions of SL3.2 seem mutually exclusive, they might support a functional switch in the HCV replication cycle, e.g. from translation to replication (Tuplin et al. 2012 ).",

Interestingly, the 5\u2032NTR and the complementary 3\u2032end of the negative-strand RNA have been shown to adopt very different secondary structures, in line with their different functions in RNA translation and replication, respectively ( Fig. 2a and c, respectively) (Honda et al. 1996 compared to Smith et al. 2002 Schuster et al. 2002) . Genetic analyses mapped the minimal region required for RNA synthesis to the 3\u2032-terminal 125 nts, comprising SL-I' and SL-IIz' (Fig. 2c ; Friebe and Bartenschlager 2009; Friebe et al. 2001) . SL-IIy' is important for efficient RNA replication, whereas the remaining stem loops only seem to have auxiliary functions (Friebe and Bartenschlager 2009 ). The distinct mechanistic roles of the stem-loop structures at 3\u2032end of the negative strand are still ill defined. In case of SL-IIz', the structure of the stem rather than the discrete sequence seems to be the major determinant. Still it is interesting to note that two miR-122 seed sequences are located in the complementary region of SL-IIz' in the 5\u2032NTR (Fig. 2a ; Jopling et al. 2005) , suggesting a role of miR-122 in the proper formation of RNA secondary structures. In case of SL-I' only the stem structure is essential for replication of genotype 1b, whereas genotype 2a is also sensitive to sequence alterations not affecting the stem structure (Friebe and Bartenschlager 2009; Luo et al. 2003) . The 3\u2032end of the HCV negative-strand genome encompasses a short single stranded region adjacent to SL-I' terminating mostly with C and sometimes with U in clinical isolates, again reflecting the need of the RdRp to initiate RNA synthesis with a purine base (Cai et al. 2004 ). However, after multiple rounds of replication in cell culture a terminal C was found to be replaced by U (Cai et al. 2004) , suggesting that A is the preferred initiating nucleotide for positive-and negative-strand synthesis in cell culture.",

The enzyme consists of a catalytic domain, followed by a linker sequence and a C-terminal membrane insertion sequence, which is essential for RNA replication in cell culture ( Fig. 3a ; Ivashkina et al. 2002; Moradpour et al. 2004 ), but seems not to significantly contribute to RNA synthesis in vitro (Lohmann et al. 1997; Yamashita et al. 1998 ). Removal of the membrane insertion sequence, comprising the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues, increases solubility and facilitates purification of NS5B; therefore, most biochemical and all structural studies so far used the so-called NS5B\u0394C21 enzyme or even C-terminal deletions encompassing up to 60 amino acid residues (Leveque et al. 2003) .",

Anyhow, the closed conformation is supposed to represent the initiation state of the polymerase, since the catalytic core only provides space for a single-stranded RNA template and nucleotides for de novo initiation of RNA synthesis, but not for a double-stranded RNA ( Fig. 3b ; Simister et al. 2009 ).

De novo initiation at the 3\u2032end of the viral positive-and negative-strand RNA is likely to be the physiological mode of initiation of RNA synthesis in infected cells, although this has not been experimentally validated yet. De novo initiation in vitro requires a terminal purine, but is most efficient with a G . It can take place even on homopolymeric polypyrimidine templates at high nucleotide concentrations (>50 \u03bcM; Luo et al. 2000) , suggesting that no specific cis-acting elements are required. However, a stable secondary structure and a single-stranded sequence of at least three nucleotides has been shown to be optimal for de novo initiation on nonhomopolymeric templates , although a secondary structure is not absolutely required (Shim et al. 2002) . The 3\u2032end of the HCV negative-strand genome consists of a stem loop with a single-stranded overhang, thereby corroborating the ideal structure for de novo initiation (Fig. 2b) . Interestingly, the 3\u2032end of the HCV positive-strand genome is buried within a stable stem structure, which cannot bind to the closed initiation conformation of NS5B (Fig. 2a) . In contrast, the positive-strand genome of the related pestiviruses terminates with 3-5 C residues adjacent to a stem loop, representing in theory an ideal template for de novo initiation by the polymerase (Yu et al. 1999) . Indeed, it has been shown that the 3\u2032end of the HCV negative strand is an excellent template for de novo initiation, whereas the 3\u2032end of the positive-strand hardly gives rise to terminal de novo initiation (Reigadas et al. 2001; Binder et al. 2007) , suggesting that auxiliary factors might be required to initiate negative-strand synthesis by NS5B, thereby probably allowing a tight regulation of this process.",

This suggests that NS5B in solution is in an equilibrium between the closed conformation observed with all crystal structures and an open conformation capable of binding to internal or circular initiation sites (Ranjith-Kumar and Kao 2006) and to primer templates (Lohmann et al. 1997; Behrens et al. 1996) .

            "text": "De novo initiation of RNA synthesis involves several steps, which have been characterized by biochemical studies, supported by structural evidence (Fig. 3b ; Harrus et al. 2010) . After binding of a single-stranded template and the first two nts matching to the 3\u2032end, a dinucleotide primer is synthesized, requiring high concentrations of the priming nts (Ferrari et al. 2008) . These dinucleotide primers are produced in great abundance and accumulate in vitro, suggesting that they dissociate rapidly from the NS5B-template complex, whereas progression to processive elongation seems to be inefficient and rate limiting (Harrus et al. 2010; Shim et al. 2002) . This initial primer synthesis seems to be facilitated by a very closed conformation, since a very high de novo initiation efficiency observed for NS5B from isolate JFH-1 correlated with a particularly closed structure (Simister et al. 2009 ). It, furthermore, requires a \"platform\" to support the first nucleotide, which has to move out of the active center upon addition of the third base. This platform has not been clearly identified in the structure of the polymerase, but it might be provided by the C-terminal linker sequence (Harrus et al. 2010) or by the beta flap in coordination with a GTP bound close to the active site, as suggested for pestiviruses (Lescar and Canard 2009; Choi et al. 2004; D'Abramo et al. 2006) . Such a role of coordinating GTP in stabilizing the initiation complex might also explain the strong stimulating effect of high GTP concentration on de novo initiation of NS5B in vitro (Lohmann et al. 1999b; Harrus et al. 2010; Ranjith-Kumar et al. 2003) .",

            "text": "The switch from primer synthesis to processive elongation requires high concentrations of the third base to be incorporated (Ferrari et al. 2008) , and is furthermore facilitated by high GTP concentrations (Harrus et al. 2010) . This switch requires a major conformational change in the polymerase structure, resulting in a move of the \"priming platform\" and an opening of the entire enzymatic core. The C-terminal linker is removed to accommodate a double-stranded RNA, allowing egress of the template-primer duplex, and the fingertips shift and adjust their contacts with the thumb (Fig. 3c) . The existence of such an \"open\" conformation is supported by data from a genotype 2a NS5B (Biswal et al. 2005) and by a recent structure of NS5B in complex with a primer template, which was obtained after deletion of the beta flap (Mosley et al. 2012) . In this structure, the C-terminal linker is disordered and no longer occludes the exit from the catalytic site and the thumb domain is moved relative to palm and fingers by 20\u00b0, generating a large cavity capable of binding doublestranded RNA (Mosley et al. 2012) . Position 405 in the thumb domain seems to be a central switch in the transition from initiation to elongation, stabilizing a closed conformation for dinucleotide synthesis, on the one hand, and facilitating the transition to the open conformation, on the other hand, (Scrima et al. 2012 ) and this position is also critical for efficient RNA replication in cell culture (Schmitt et al. 2011) . It should be noted that the C-terminal linker, supposed to take part in the major conformational switch to elongation, is directly connected to the transmembrane segment of NS5B (Ivashkina et al. 2002 ) and thereby will probably cause a repositioning of the entire enzyme relative to the membrane.",

The overall slow and inefficient initiation reaction, requiring very high nucleotide concentrations in vitro, suggests that this process might be facilitated by auxiliary factors in vivo (Harrus et al. 2010) . It is, furthermore, puzzling that the 3\u2032end of the positive-strand RNA is not a bona fide template for de novo initiation, suggesting that initiation of negative-strand synthesis might be a tightly regulated process, requiring additional co-factors. The absence of a clear specificity for viral templates in vitro is in striking contrast to the importance of the CREs for replication in cell culture. Finally, NS5B shows a strong preference for G as initiating nucleotide in vitro, but constitutively initiates negative-strand synthesis with A in vivo and even tends to convert initiation of positive-strand synthesis from G to A in cell culture (Cai et al. 2004) . Taken together, analysis of purified NS5B in vitro as well as structural studies provided a number of important insights into the mechanisms of HCV RNA synthesis, but did not reveal the complex regulation of this process in vivo.",

In addition, NS3h could support NS5B in the elongation phase by unwinding double-stranded replication intermediates. Finally, a ssRNA translocase activity might help to strip proteins off the RNA or deliver RNA for packaging into virions (Gu and Rice 2010) . However, none of these functions could yet be validated in cell-based assays. Still, a number of cross-talks between NS3h and other nonstructural proteins have been demonstrated in vitro, which might point to important regulatory functions in vivo. On the one hand, the helicase activity of NS3 is regulated by the NS3 protease domain and by NS5B (Jennings et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2005) , on the other hand, NS3h stimulates the RdRp in vitro (Piccininni et al. 2002) , suggesting that NS3 and NS5B indeed might function together.",

            "text": "Essential functions of NS5A in viral RNA synthesis, particularly of the hypophosphorylated variant, are clearly suggested from genetic studies. Many cell culture adaptive mutations increasing RNA replication efficiency of genotype 1 isolates and reducing the level of hyperphosphorylated NS5A are found in NS5A (for further details see chapters \"Cell Culture Systems for Hepatitis C Virus\" and \"Hepatitis C Virus Proteins: From Structure to Function\", this volume). The analysis of the mechanistic role of NS5A is particularly hampered by the existence of these different phospho-isoforms. The determinants involved in regulation of phosphorylation are ill defined as is the case for most of the phosphorylation sites and their role in viral RNA synthesis. However, the synthesis of p58 requires at least an NS3-5A polyprotein (Koch and Bartenschlager 1999) ; therefore, different purified phospho-isoforms have not been accessible for in vitro assays yet and it can be assumed that heterologously expressed NS5A might not be properly phosphorylated. Still, in vitro studies suggest that low doses of NS5A stimulate NS5B, whereas high doses are inhibitory to the polymerase (Shirota et al. 2002; Quezada and Kane 2009 ). An inhibitory function of NS5A was also found in a cell-based assay (Ranjith-Kumar et al. 2011) , suggesting a regulatory role of NS5A for RNA synthesis. The most distinct biochemical property of NS5A that could be envisaged in RNA synthesis is its RNA-binding activity, which resides in domain 1 and is modulated by domains 2 and 3 (Foster et al. 2010) . One of the available crystal structures of NS5A domain 1, indeed, suggests that NS5A dimers form a basic cleft capable of accommodating RNA (Tellinghuisen et al. 2005) , which might play a role in RNA transport, e.g. from replication to assembly sites (see also chapters \"Hepatitis C Virus Proteins: From Structure to Function\" and \"Virion Assembly and Release\", this volume). In addition, NS5A interacts with and recruits a plethora of host cell proteins, which might be directly or indirectly involved in RNA synthesis (see below).",

Initially, cyclophilin B was found to interact with NS5B, regulating template binding of the polymerase (Watashi et al. 2005) . More recent results rather suggest that cyclophilin A (CyPA) is critical for viral RNA replication (Kaul et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2009 ) and resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors point to NS5A as the main target site of CyPA (Yang et al. 2010; Kaul et al. 2009 ). CyPA has, furthermore, been shown to directly convert proline residues in NS5A domains 2 and 3 (Coelmont et al. 2010; Verdegem et al. 2011) , probably inducing conformational changes critically involved in the function of NS5A. Dependence on CypA can be overcome in part by reducing the cleavage kinetics at the NS5A/NS5B junction, arguing that a kinetically controlled folding step of NS5A plays an important role for viral replicase activity (Kaul et al. 2009 ).",

However, mathematic modeling of viral decline after therapy revealed that about 10 12 virions are produced per day in infected individuals (Neumann et al. 1998 ), suggesting also a relatively high dynamics of RNA replication in the infected liver. Previous studies in chimpanzees determined 10 3 -3 \u00d7 10 5 genomes per \u03bcg of total liver RNA (equivalent to ~10 4 -10 5 cells), depending on the sample. Therefore, it was assumed that 0.1-30 % of hepatocytes are infected, assuming that an infected cell should contain at least 10 positive-strand RNA genomes to maintain persistent replication (Bigger et al. 2004) . Recent studies using highly sensitive two-photon microscopy found that up to 20 % of human hepatocytes are infected, most of the antigen positive cells containing clearly detectable amounts of double-stranded RNA, arguing for much higher HCV RNA copy numbers than 10 per infected cell ).",

(see chapter \"Cell Culture Systems for Hepatitis C Virus\", this volume). Detailed replication kinetics are only available for the most efficient system, replication of the genotype 2a isolate JFH-1 in Huh-7 cells, either upon transfection with subgenomic replicons (Binder et al. 2007) or after virus infection (Keum et al. 2012) , revealing very similar results. First viral negativestrand RNAs are detectable 4 or 6 h after transfection or infection, respectively. After this time point, negative-strand RNA levels increase exponentially, reaching a plateau at 24-48 h and slightly declining later on. Most (>90 %) of the incoming positive-strand RNA is degraded within the first hours in both model systems reaching a minimum at the onset of negative-strand synthesis (Binder et al. 2007; Keum et al. 2012) . At this time point, positive-to negative-strand ratios are ~1:1, then exponential positive-strand synthesis starts and parallels negative-strand synthesis, again reaching a plateau 24-48 h after transfection/infection, with a positiveor negative-strand ratio of ~10:1. This ratio stays constant in case of the replicon (Binder et al. 2007 ), but interestingly increases up to 100:1 in case of the infection model (Keum et al. 2012) . These data overall suggest that only a minority of incoming positive strands are entering into a productive replication cycle, starting with a 1:1 conversion into probably double-stranded replication intermediates (Targett-Adams et al. 2008 ). The initial lag-phase of 4-6 h might represent the time required for polyprotein translation, generation of the membranous replication compartment and RNA synthesis (100-400 nts/min. in vitro) (Lohmann et al. 1998; Simister et al. 2009 ). Asymmetric RNA synthesis is established within a few hours later, rapidly reaching the 10:1 excess of positive-strand RNA typical for all positive-strand RNA viruses. The plateau of RNA synthesis reached within 24-48 h for JFH1 probably reflects restrictions by the host cell, e.g. due to limiting host factors involved in RNA synthesis . Less efficient genotype 1 replicons exhibit a much slower replication kinetics with no clear exponential phase and reach steady-state replication levels at much later time points (Binder et al. 2007; Krieger et al. 2001) . The strong increase of positive-to-negtive-strand ratios observed late in infection, but not for replicons, is counterintuitive, since positive-strand genomes should rather be depleted due to the secretion of virions (Keum et al. 2012 ). However, negativestrand synthesis, in contrast to positive-strand synthesis, probably depends on the continuous generation of new replication sites by positive-strands entering into new translation/RNA replication cycles, which might be limited during the full viral life cycle because of the competition with virion production.",

Viral negative strands are the most limiting component in replicon cells with less than 100 copies per cell on average, which also represents by definition the maximal number of active replication sites per cell (Quinkert et al. 2005) . In contrast, more than 1,000,000 copies of nonstructural proteins are found, indicating that not all vesicular structures seen in EM or antigen positive dots in IF studies can represent active replication complexes (Quinkert et al. 2005) . Based on their resistance to proteases, only a subfraction of less than 5 % of these protein copies seem to be engaged in the formation of viral replication sites (Miyanari et al. 2003; Quinkert et al. 2005) . Interestingly, roughly 1,000-5,000 positive-strand RNA molecules per cell were reported for transient and steady-state cell cultures and this number might represent a limit of Huh-7based cell cultures (Quinkert et al. 2005; Keum et al. 2012; Blight et al. 2002) .",

Since the half lives of viral NS-proteins and viral positive-strand RNA in replicon cells have been shown to be 11-16 h (Pietschmann et al. 2001; Pause et al. 2003) , it can be estimated that only about 1,000 positive-strand RNA molecules are synthesized per day per cell by ca. 100 replicase complexes (Quinkert et al. 2005) . In consequence, each newly synthesized positive strand has to be excessively translated to yield the ascertained surplus of proteins, whereas RNA synthesis is a rather rare event, which most likely is achieved only by a few nonstructural protein copies (Fig. 1b) . However, it is currently unclear, which mechanisms render a few replicase copies active and the majority inactive.",

            "text": "Based on our still patchy understanding described above, it is tempting to summarize our current knowledge on viral RNA replication in a tentative succession of events. After release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell, the positive-strand RNA is translated giving rise to numerous polyprotein copies at the ER-membrane, which are co-and post-translationally processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. A fraction of NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B drives the formation of membrane alterations, mainly DMVs, supported by several host factors, e.g. PI4KIII\u03b1. It seems likely that active replication sites are connected to the cytoplasm to allow access of nucleotides and release of newly synthesized RNA (Fig. 1a, b) . Negative-strand synthesis is most likely initiated within such vesicular structures, resulting in a probably (partially?) double-stranded replication intermediate. Since most nonstructural proteins cannot be complemented in trans, it can be assumed that RNA synthesis is initiated from a protein complex translated from the same RNA molecule. This protein complex might assemble at the polyU tract of the genome and probably contains the entire set of NS3 to 5B and some host factors. Initiation of negative-strand synthesis involves cis-acting elements within NS5B and the 3\u2032NTR and might be the most tightly regulated step in the entire process of RNA replication. Since the 3\u2032end of the positive strand is buried in a strong stem, it is not a template for de novo initiation of RNA synthesis by the polymerase; therefore, it seems likely that additional factors like the viral helicase might be essential at this step. NS5B initiates RNA replication by production of a dinucleotide primer, then undergoes a huge conformational change and processively copies the entire genome. Currently it is not clear, whether primer synthesis really takes place at the 3\u2032end or at a different site of the genome, as in case of poliovirus (Paul et al. 2000) , with a subsequent transfer of the polymerase/primer complex to the 3\u2032end. Due to the low and limiting number of negative-strand RNA, it is furthermore tempting to speculate that negative-strand synthesis can be initiated only once from a positive strand by a cis-acting protein complex translated on the same RNA. In this scenario, initiation of negative-strand RNA would essentially require a preceding translation of the positive-strand RNA, resulting in the formation of a new replication vesicle and each replication site would indeed contain only one negative-strand RNA/replication intermediate (Fig. 1b) . At least in vitro, synthesis of progeny positive strands can directly be initiated by the polymerase due to a favorable 3\u2032 terminal structure of the negative strand, thereby probably allowing multiple initiation cycles, resulting in an overall surplus of positive-strand RNA. The progeny positive-strand RNA is released into the cytoplasm by a yet to be defined mechanism, which could involve NS5A and the translocase function of the NS3 helicase. Mechanisms terminating the lifespan of an active replication site are not known so far. However, the connection to the cytoplasm might simply be constricted after a certain time, sequestering the replication intermediates inside DMVs to prevent recognition by innate immunity, as suggested for arteriviruses (Knoops et al. 2011) .",

The complex linkage between translation/replication and cis-/transacting functions in the replication cycle of positive-strand RNA viruses severely impedes the analysis of individual steps of RNA synthesis in cell culture models.
