            "text": "Compounds containing a trifluoromethyl ketone (CF3-ketone) moiety form an important group of biologically useful fluorinated molecules6 that can be used as protease inhibitors, as first described by Abeles et al.7 The CF3 group next to the carbonyl group thermodynamically stabilizes the hemi-ketal form relative to the ketone form, thus making the carbonyl prone to nucleophilic substitution by water, the active site Ser hydroxyl or Cys thiol group present in serine or cysteine proteases. Nucleophilic attack by the active site thiol in SARS-CoV 3CLpro would convert the CF3-ketone A to the tetrahedral adduct B (\nScheme 1), which is believed to mimic the substrate\u2013enzyme intermediate formed during substrate peptide-bond hydrolysis. Since adduct B is relatively stable, compound A would behave as a protease inhibitor,8 suggesting that compounds containing a CF3-ketone moiety may play an important role as 3CLpro inhibitors. CF3-ketone A also forms a relatively stable hydrate adduct C upon reacting with water. A unique and conservative recognition of the substrate's Gln residue at the P1 site has been identified in the CoV cysteine protease family.9 Therefore, a Gln-derived CF3-ketone residue would contribute to the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. Based on these considerations, a new synthetic method for forming Gln and Glu derivatives possessing a CF3-ketone moiety was developed and this strategy was used in the synthesis of four peptides (compounds 1\u20134).",

In the patent literature, there is one report of desilylation occurring upon stirring similar compounds in methanol,13 most likely caused by water present in the methanol. For our substrate, we found that this method only proceeded when the reaction was carried out on a small scale (20 mg or less). However, by adding water to the methanol [methanol/water (9:1 v/v)], substrate 8 could be fully converted to compound 9 after 3 h stirring at room temperature (Scheme 2).",

From the 13C and 19F NMR analyses of this ketone, it became evident that the ketone exists as a ca. 7:3 mixture of the hydrate and keto forms. The rather unstable ketone 24 was then deprotected giving dipeptide 25 in almost quantitative yield in ca. 90% purity as determined by HPLC analysis.

However, the glutamate-possessing inhibitor 1 was the most potent of the group. The conformation that these compounds exist in during their interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro is believed to contribute to binding affinity. Cai and co-workers found that their Gln fluoromethyl ketones exhibited low activity in their assays, a fact which they explained by referring to that their inhibitors predominantly exist in the cyclic form as evident from NMR studies.20 Indeed, the cyclic form is not expected to interact effectively with the active site of SARS-CoV.20 The Gln compounds synthesized in our study were also found to be mainly in the cyclic form which may explain the low biological activity for these compounds.

Kinetic measurements were performed at 25 \u00b0C in buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM TCEP. The inhibition constant, K\ni, was determined by measuring the apparent kinetic parameters at a constant substrate concentration with varying inhibitor concentrations (0\u20131 mM). The protease (final concentration of 1 mM) was incubated with inhibitor for 10 min at room temperature and the reaction was initiated by adding the substrate (a volume corresponding to a final concentration of 5 mM in the reaction mixture). The dependence of activity on the inhibitor concentration was analyzed in a manner similar to what was reported earlier.30 Briefly, the kinetic parameters were determined by global nonlinear regression analysis to the equation.vI/v0=Vmax[S]/{[S]+Km(1+[I]/Ki)}where v\nI and v\n0 are the rate of substrate cleavage in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively. V\nmax is the maximal rate, [S] is the substrate concentration, [I] is the inhibitor concentration, and K\nm is the Michaelis constant.31\n",
