Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is capable of performing syndrome differentiation and treatment according to the clinical manifestations of patients, and has a better ability of epidemic prevention and control.

China has listed COVID-19 as a class B infectious disease and has undertaken preventive and control measures according to class A infectious diseases [2] . With the spread of the epidemic, presently, patients infected with the novel coronavirus, as well as those with asymptomatic infection, are the main sources of infection; thus, COVID-19 is an infectious disease with a medium to slightly high contagious capacity [3] . The incubation period of the disease is generally 7 days, and the longest is 14 days; however, some cases have reported an incubation period of 24 days as well [4] .

Clinical trials for new drugs such as remdesivir and coolidge are underway; however, the clinical promotion and short-term use of these drugs is unlikely. Therefore, given the particularities of this disease, it is of critical clinical value to formulate a set of treatment plans using integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine, based on the concept of prevention and treatment. To utilize the advantages of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, this paper discussed the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 from the viewpoint of integrated TCM and Western medicine, the treatment measures for different susceptible groups, and the effect along with matters needing attention, so as to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Coronavirus is a type of a ribonucleic acid virus with an envelope structure, characterized by rod-like protuberances on the surface and can infect multiple host species, causing a variety of diseases [6] .

However, according to Wu You-ke's The Treatise on Epidemic Febrile Diseases [11] , which mentions \"the febrile disease is non-wind, non-cold, non-heat and non-damp; it is a different feeling between heaven and earth,\" the cause of this disease is very clear, differing from the other six exotic evils, and presenting characteristics of a strong and contagious epidemic virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 143, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 208, "end": 212, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 622, "end": 626, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Etiology"}, {"text": "Wuhan, the center of the outbreak pathogen, is located in the east of Jianghan Plain of China.

Hence, this disease is an epidemic, with the primary nature of \"damp\" and \"toxic,\" and thus can be termed \"damp toxin disease.\" Furthermore, in 2019, Wuhan experienced a warm winter climate, with incoming heat instead of cold.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 264, "end": 268, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Etiology"}, {"text": "From the perspective of TCM, this kind of climate change is prone to generate damp-heat in the human body, which persists and is difficult to eliminate from Sanjiao (one of the six fu-organs in TCM theory). Some patients have a recurrent fever, bitter mouth, insomnia, upset, chest tightness and shortness of breath, fatigue, yellow or greasy tongue coating, and slippery pulse, which are manifestations of the evil underlying Shaoyang meridian according to the six-meridian syndrome differentiation theory [13] . Notably, the most severe cases developed dyspnea one week later, which even progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, intractable metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, leading to death [14] . According to TCM, the toxins from these patients not only hurt the Qi but also injure the nutrient blood and result in blood stasis; the pericardium transmission channel is also reversed, resulting in mental changes. Dampness stagnates for a prolonged period and turns into heat; heat toxin accumulates for a long time, resulting in stasis; stasis and heat combine mutually and then generate syncope, which consumes Qi and Yin and leads to a deficiency. According to the principle of \"three factors and measures,\" there exist various etiological characteristics in different regions, as well as climatic factors. Fan et al. [15] observed and analyzed the TCM pathological characteristics of \"dryness\" in Hunan cases, and concluded that dryness and dampness are mainly due to \"child disease to mother\" in the course of the disease. In the theory of TCM, dryness evil can easily injure the lung. Lung and spleen belong to \"gold\" and \"soil\" in the five-element theory of TCM. Dryness turns into dampness. Dampness easily traps spleen. Wet soil is the mother of dryness \"gold.\" Furthermore, excessive lung dryness injures the spleen \"soil\"; hence, both lung dryness and spleen dampness are significant. In contrast, Yu et al. [16] summed up the data and concluded that the diseases in Guangdong Province and Gansu Province were caused by warm-heat toxin or epidemic toxin, which was closely related to their regional environment. Guangdong Province is hot and humid all year round, and the epidemic Qi can easily mix with evils of damp and heat to attack the lung; however, the overall 2019 winter temperature in Gansu Province was higher than that experienced in previous years.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1368, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1966, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Etiology"}, {"text": "Additionally, Gansu is located in the northwest region of China, which is mostly dry and warm, and susceptible to the evil of dryness that can cause lung disease.

After careful assessment of the four pieces of diagnostic evidence available regarding the confirmed cases, it was observed that this epidemic is mainly caused by a dampness pathogen, with the disease location of mainly Sangjiao, and the core pathogenesis is \"dampness, heat, poison, blood stasis and deficiency,\" which runs through the whole process of dampness and intoxication and closure of the lung. The Treatise on Epidemic Febrile Diseases [11] ascertains that typhoid fever does not infect people, but epidemic diseases can infect people. The evil of typhoid fever enters from the orifices, while the evil of epidemic disease enters only from the mouth and nose; it has been observed that during an epidemic, the evil comes from the mouth and nose, remains in the membrane, and unconsciously lurks in the human body [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 776, "end": 780, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1157, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis"}, {"text": "COVID-19 is located in the lung, where evil Qi first invades the body from the mouth and nose, repressing the lung Qi.

Wang Qingren stated in Correcting Mistakes in Medicine that \"the plague toxin burns its blood inside, and if the blood is burned and refined, the blood will coagulate [18] .\" During this period, the heat toxin burns the body fluid, and dampness suppresses the Qi mechanism, resulting in the stasis of blood, manifested in the form of increased dyspnea and additional mental problems occurring during the reverse transmission of the pericardium.

According to TCM, after conception, the whole body's Yin-blood is gathered in Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian, and the uterus, placing the pregnant women in a special physiological state of a relative deficiency of Yin-blood and relative hyperactivity of Yang Qi. The growing fetus will block the rise and fall of Qi and blood, resulting in poor operation of Qi and blood. \"It should be cool before pregnancy and warm after birth\" is the general principle of regulation and stabilization in TCM before and after pregnancy. This can be adjusted and treated in advance to prevent the occurrence of disease, and the method of nourishing Yin and clearing heat, regulating the Qi mechanism, and calming the fetus is adopted.

Syndrome differentiation and treatment, as one of the characteristics and advantages of TCM, is very important in diagnosis and treatment. For example, in the treatment of COVID-19, the syndrome types differ among individuals in different regions, under different climatic conditions, and for relatively different physiques. Syndrome differentiation should be clearly defined in combination with different factors and clinical syndrome characteristics. Prescriptions are mainly used to improve immunity, balance human Qi, blood, Yin and Yang, and recover organ function. According to the study of COVID-19 treatment herbs [41, 42] , Chinese herbal medicines with a higher probability to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 have been selected, including Lianqiao, Gancao, Sangbaipi, Jinyinhua, Sangye, Pipaye, and other herbs, commonly used to treat viral pneumonia. Drugs should be selected and utilized according to the corresponding syndrome types. Furthermore, with disease development, the drugs should be given the flexibility to deal with different syndrome types, and the whole process should be adjusted according to the principle of \"three factors and measures,\" undertaking multi-target treatment. TCM also plays a leading role during the recovery period and post-discharge convalescence. Currently, although some patients present a negative nucleic acid test accompanied by alleviated pneumonia and recovered body temperature, they may still demonstrate symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and anxiety. Some patients may present pulmonary fibrosis due to poor absorption of pulmonary inflammation, which may affect the quality of life; additionally, some patients may suffer adverse reactions during drug therapy. It is crucial to resolve such related issues when TCM is involved.
