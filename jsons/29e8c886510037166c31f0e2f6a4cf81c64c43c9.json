Usual Clinical Characteristics of Gastroenteritis Virus Infections mature particles. NSP4 plays a key role in the assembly process of these particles, which is Ca 2+ dependent. Lastly, mature viruses are released by cell lysis or by vesicular transport. 7 Infected intestinal cells change from columnar to cuboidal, with fewer and shorter microvilli; the cells are sloughed off resulting in shorter villi. Changes occur within 24 hours of infection, start proximally and progress caudally. 4, 29 Diarrhea results from a mixture of causes: decreased absorption of salt and water secondary to enterocyte damage and replacement of absorptive intestinal cells by secreting cells from the crypts; loss of disaccharides at the damaged brush border (Table 162- 5) . 5, 56 Both NoV and SaV produce diarrheal illness in humans and NoV is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 372, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 607, "end": 609, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 610, "end": 612, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 871, "end": 873, "text": "5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 876, "end": 878, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 879, "end": 881, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 859, "end": 870, "text": "(Table 162-", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Nature"}, {"text": "The CV genomes are about 7.3-8.5 kilobases in length and organized in two or three open reading frames (ORFs). In the genera with three ORFs (NoV and Vesivirus) the first ORF (ORF1) encodes for a large protein that by proteolytic cleavage produces the NSPs. The ORF2 encodes for the single major structural protein (VP1), and the ORF3 encodes for a minor structural protein (VP2). The Nebovirus and Lagovirus have only 2 ORFs. In these viruses, VP1 and VP2 are encoded in ORF1 and ORF2, respectively. 56 A typical CV (Norwalk virus) capsid is formed by 90 VP1 dimers with 90 arch-like protruding capsomers arranged in such a way as to leave 32 calices on the viral surface. The VP1 has two major domains: the shell (S) domain and the protruding (P) domain. The S domain forms the inner part of the capsid. It has 225 amino acids (aa), including aa 10-49 corresponding to the N terminal region of the protein (N subdomain), which faces the interior of the capsid. The P domain includes amino acids 226-520 and is subdivided into subdomains P1 and P2. The P1 subdomain (aa 226-278 and 406-520) form the sides of the capsomers whereas the P2 subdomain (aa 279-405) form the most protruding part of the capsomers' arch ( Figure 162 -2). Each virion has only one or two copies of the VP2 (~22-29 kDa). The VP2 resulting in carbohydrate malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea; and the effect of NSP4, a viral enterotoxin that increases plasma membrane chloride permeability leading to secretory diarrhea. 30 RV RNA and replicating viruses are frequently detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, 31 showing that RV represents a systemic infection with increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 32 Immunity against RVs is likely multifactorial; involving local (mucosal) and systemic (serum) antibodies as well as innate and cellular immunity. 33, 34 VP7 and VP4 induce serum-neutralizing antibodies against the infecting serotype (homotypic) that appear within 2 weeks of infection and correlate with protection. 21 Heterotypic antibodies (those against different serotypes) also occur, but mainly among adults and are dependent on the infecting strain. Homotypic protection lasts longer than heterotypic protection but is incomplete and short lived. 21 Anti-RV antibody levels are high at birth (transplacentally acquired), decline by 3-6 months, rise to a peak at 2-3 years and remain elevated throughout life (probably because of repeated, mostly asymptomatic infections). 35 Serum antibodies do not always prevent infection, pointing to the potential role of mucosal immunity. For example, IgA deficient mice shed RV for a prolonged time and are not protected against reinfection. 31 Furthermore, mucosal immunity, passively acquired by breast-feeding 36 or by orally administered immune globulins 37 ameliorates RV symptoms. Mucosal immunity develops 4 weeks after infection and persists for several months, eventually decreasing with advancing age. 38 Experimental and clinical data suggest a role for non-neutralizing anti-VP6 39-41 and other antibodies 42 in protection against RV disease. Cell-mediated immunity also seems important. In mice, RV-specific cytotoxic T cells appear in the intestinal mucosa soon after infection, and mice with severe combined immunodeficiency are able to clear RV infection when reconstituted with CD8 T cells, despite their lack of antibodies against the virus. 43 Lastly, the role of innate immunity is being explored. 44 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 501, "end": 503, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1497, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1589, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1685, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1835, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1838, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2004, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2240, "end": 2242, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2467, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2674, "end": 2676, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2944, "end": 2946, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 3392, "end": 3394, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 3450, "end": 3452, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1217, "end": 1227, "text": "Figure 162", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Rotavirus genome segments"}, {"text": "The clinical spectrum of RV infections ranges from asymptomatic to severe disease with dehydration and death; severity may be associated with antigenemia. 45 The usual clinical picture is presented in Table  162 -3; in addition, transaminase elevation occurs in about 15% of cases 46 and neurological manifestations are increasingly recognized. 47 The disease is self-limiting and chronic infection has not been described in the normal host. 35 Neonatal RV infections are symptomatic in only 10-20% of cases and usually mild, 48 but severe infections may occur among premature infants and those in special care units. 49 Immunodeficient individuals can present a chronic or serious course with associated mortality. 50 Children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and not receiving antiretroviral therapy, may have a twofold risk of RV symptomatic infection and more prolonged virus shedding, but the severity of the illness itself may be similar to that seen in HIV-uninfected children. 51, 52 Diagnostic Microbiology Antigen detection kits based on enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and latex agglutination are the tests of choice for most clinical circumstances with high sensitivity and specificity (70-100%).

By 1 year 80% of the children had at least one norovirus infection and by 2 years 71% had one or more episodes of norovirus-associated diarrhea. 69 Genogroups I and II strains produce the majority of infections. At a given time, most infections are caused by a major circulating strain. For example, after 2000, GII genogroup caused 96% of sporadic infections in children worldwide 70 and genogroup II.4 strains has caused more than 80% of US outbreaks since the 1990s. 71 Coinfections with different strains occur, giving the opportunity for the exchange of genetic material between strains and the generation of new virus variants. 72 Pandemic variants emerge every 2-4 years. Outbreaks occur mainly in daycare centers, schools, colleges, hospitals, nursing homes, military barracks, restaurants, vacation facilities and cruise ships. NoV also causes travelers' diarrhea. NoV can spread internationally through contaminated food or beverages. 73 A study of 8271 food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis showed a median of affected persons of 25 versus 10 for the bacterial outbreaks. Ten percent of the individuals required medical care and 1% were hospitalized. 74 Sapovirus epidemiology is summarized in Table 162 -2.

VP2 is not needed for VLPs assembly but is essential for infections in feline calicivirus. The VLPs are morphologically and antigenically similar to natural virions. 58 The NoV has six nonstructural proteins with different functions: NSP 1/2 (p48), replication complex formation; NSP3 (NTPase), nucleoside triphosphatase/RNA helicase; NSP4 (p22), replication complex formation; NSP5 (VPg), genome linked protein involved in translation and replication; NSP6 (3CL, Pro), protease; and NSP7 (Pol, RdRp), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They play a role in the replication process of the genome RNA. 57, 59 Epidemiology Human caliciviruses (HuCV) have worldwide distribution, and NoV infects persons of all ages, both in high-income and low-and middleincome countries (LMIC). 60 They are the most common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks, and they are also recognized as the most common cause of endemic gastroenteritis. 61 In the USA, NoV produces 400 000 emergency department visits and 1.7 million office visits per year; 62 it also accounts for 19-21 million illnesses, 56 000-71 000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths. 63 Norovirus is the most commonly detected pathogen (26%) in adults with gastroenteritis. 64, 65 In a 2009-2010 study of children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis, RV and NoV were detected in 12 and 21 of the cases, respectively. The study conclusion is that 'norovirus has become the leading cause of medically attended gastroenteritis in US children' being responsible for approximately 1 million healthcare visits yearly. 66 Norovirus infections occur mainly during the cold seasons. Almost 80% of cases and 71% of outbreaks occur from October to March in the northern hemisphere and from April to September in the southern hemisphere. The reasons for seasonality are not well understood but rainfall may play a role. Breaks in seasonality pattern have been observed with the emergence of new variant strains. 67 Norovirus infections start early in life; a Finnish study found that the prevalence of GII-4 IgG antibodies was 47% in children aged 7-23 production protects against infection. 94 Earlier studies suggested that immunity is mostly short-term (6 months-2 years) and type-specific; however, several clinical and epidemiological observations were inconsistent with this notion.

Brush border enzymes are decreased, producing malabsorption of carbohydrates and fat. The changes are transient and resolve within 2 weeks. 82, 83 No histological lesions are seen in the gastric or rectal mucosa, and the secretion of hydrochloric acid, pepsin and intrinsic factor remain normal. 84 Gastric emptying is markedly delayed, which could explain the frequency of nausea and vomiting; however, the degree of delay does not correlate with the severity of vomiting. 85 Reduction of villous surface area, and sealing junctional proteins as well as increased active anion secretion, cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes and apoptosis, have been observed suggesting that norovirus diarrhea is caused by a leak flux and secretory component. 86 Virus shedding in the stools begins during the prodrome stage, lasts 13-56 days (median 28 days) 87 and it can persist for several weeks after resolution of symptoms, especially in infants and for months to years in immunocompromised patients. 88, 89 Norovirus infection starts when the protruding domain (P) of the VP1 binds specific carbohydrate receptors on the cell membrane; thereafter NoV enters the cell by a process that requires a protein receptor. This is followed by virus uncoating and release of VPglinked RNA genome to the cytoplasm. Genome replication starts with a negative-sense RNA intermediate. This process is performed by NSP7 (RdRp). The genome functions as an mRNA for the first viral RNA translation, and becomes a template for a double-stranded replication form (RF). Thereafter positive-sense RNA synthesis begins. During the replication process, full genome and subgenomic RNA are formed. Subgenomic RNA consists of the last 2.4 kb of the genome (ORF2+ORF3), and it is also attached to VPg. The ORF1 generates the polyprotein that after cleavage produces the NSPs. NS1/2 and NS4 recruit cellular membranes to form a replication complex. Both VP1 and VP2 capsid proteins are translated mainly by subgenomic RNA. VP1 self-assembles to form the capsid or VLP. Nevertheless VP2 is required for infectivity.

HBGAs include the ABO, Lewis and secretor families. HBGAs production is genetically controlled. The FUT2 gene controls the expression of fucosyltransferase 2 in saliva and mucosal secretions. Individuals who do not have the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors. Twenty percent of Europeans are non-secretors and resistant to infection with the NV.
