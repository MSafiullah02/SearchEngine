The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric Spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and report the crystal structure at 2.4 \u00c5 of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilising, CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding would facilitate conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryo-EM analysis confirms that incubation of Spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope may be useful therapeutically, possibly in synergy with an antibody blocking receptor attachment. 2 3",

In late 2019 a highly infectious illness, with cold-like symptoms progressing to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, resulting in an estimated 6% overall death rate (Baud et al., 2020) , with higher mortality among the elderly and immunocompromised populations, was identified and confirmed as a pandemic by the WHO on 11 th March 2020. The etiological agent is a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to lineage B betacoronavirus and sharing 88% sequence identity with bat coronaviruses (Lu et al., 2020a) . The heavily glycosylated trimeric surface Spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell. It is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein (the ectodomain alone comprises over 1200 residues) (Wrapp et al., 2020) . It is made as a single polypeptide and then cleaved by host proteases to yield an N-terminal S1 region and the C-terminal S2 region.",

            "text": "Spike exists initially in a pre-fusion state where the domains of S1 cloak the upper portion of the spike with the relatively small (~22 kDa) S1 RBD nestled at the tip. The RBD is predominantly in a 'down' state where the receptor binding site is inaccessible, however it appears that it stochastically flips up with a hinge-like motion transiently presenting the ACE2 receptor binding site (Roy, 2020; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . ACE2 acts as a functional receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, binding to the latter with a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity (K D of ~15 nM), possibly contributing to its ease of transmission (Song et al., 2018; Wrapp et al., 2020) . There is 73% sequence identity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S1 ). When ACE2 locks on it holds the RBD 'up', destabilising the S1 cloak and possibly favouring conversion to a postfusion form where the S2 subunit, through massive conformational changes, propels its fusion domain upwards to engage with the host membrane, casting off S1 in the process (Song et al., 2018; Wrapp et al., 2020) . Structural studies of the RBD in complex with ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Yan et al., 2020) how that it is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 through mainly polar interactions. The S 4 protein is an attractive candidate for both vaccine development and immunotherapy. Potent nanomolar affinity neutralising human monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV RBD have been identified that attach at the ACE2 receptor binding site (including M396, CR3014 and 80R (Ter Meulen et al., 2006; Sui et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2007) ). For example 80R binds with nanomolar affinity, prevents binding to ACE2 and the formation of syncytia in vitro, and inhibits viral replication in vivo (Sui et al., 2004) . However, despite the two viruses sharing the same ACE2 receptor these ACE2 blocking antibodies do not bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Wrapp et al., 2020) . In contrast CR3022, a SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal selected from a single chain Fv phage display library constructed from lymphocytes of a convalescent SARS patient and reconstructed into IgG1 format (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) , has been reported to cross-react strongly, binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with a K D of 6.3 nM (Tian et al., 2020) , whilst not competing with the binding of ACE2 (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) . Furthermore, although SARS-CoV escape mutations could be readily generated for ACE2blocking CR3014, no escape mutations could be generated for CR3022, preventing mapping of its epitope (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) . Furthermore a natural mutation of SARS-CoV-2 has now been detected at residue 495 (Y N) (GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017) : Accession ID: EPI_ISL_429783 Wienecke-Baldacchino et al., 2020), which forms part of the ACE2 binding epitope. Finally, CR3022 and CR3014 act synergistically to neutralise SARS-CoV with extreme potency (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) . Whilst this work was being prepared for publication a paper reporting that CR3022 does not neutralise SARS-CoV-2 and describing the structure of the complex with the RBD at 3.1 \u00c5 resolution was published (Yuan et al., 2020) . Here we extend the structure analysis to significantly higher resolution and, using a different neutralisation assay, show that CR3022 does neutralise SARS-CoV-2, but via a mechanism that would not be detected by the method of Yuan et al (Yuan et al., 2020) . We use cryo-EM analysis of the interaction of CR3022 with the full Spike ectodomain to confirm 5 this mechanism. Taken together these observations suggest that the CR3022 epitope should be a major target for therapeutic antibodies.",

Using SPR to perform a competition assay revealed that the binding of ACE2 to the RBD is perturbed by the presence of CR3022 ( Figure S3 ). The presence of ACE2 slows the binding of CR3022 to RBD and accelerates the dissociation. Similarly, the release of ACE2 from RBD is accelerated by the presence of CR3022. These observations are suggestive of an allosteric effect between ACE2 and CR3022.",

Crystals grew rapidly and consistently. Two crystal forms grew in the same drop. The solvent content of the crystal form solved first was unusually high (ca 87%) with the ACE2 binding site exposed to large continuous solvent channels within the crystal lattice ( Figure S4 ). These crystals therefore offer a promising vehicle for crystallographic screening to identify potential therapeutics that could act to block virus attachment. The current analysis of this crystal form is at 4.4 \u00c5 resolution and so, to avoid overfitting, refinement used a novel real-space refinement algorithm to optimise the phases (Vagabond, HMG unpublished, see Methods). This, together with the favourable observation to parameter ratio resulting from the exceptionally high solvent content, meant that the map was of very high quality, allowing reliable structural interpretation ( Figure S5 , Methods). Full interpretation of the detailed interactions between CR3022 and the RBD was enabled by the second crystal form which diffracted to high resolution, 2.4 \u00c5, and the structure of which was refined to give an R-work/R-free of 0.213/0.239 and good stereochemistry (Methods, Table S3, Figure   S5 ).",

There are two complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit with residues 331-529 in one RBD, 332-445 and 448-532 in the other RBD well defined, whilst residues133-136 of the CR3022 heavy chains are disordered. The RBD has a very similar structure to that seen in the complex of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2, rmsd for 194 Ca atoms of 0.6 \u00c5 2 (PDB, 6M0J (Lan et al., 2020) ), and an rmsd of 1.1 \u00c5 2 compared to the SARS CoV RBD (PDB, 2AJF (Li et al., 2005) ). Only minor conformational changes are introduced by binding to CR3022, at residues 381-390. The RBD was deglycosylated (Methods) to leave a single saccharide unit at each of the N-linked glycosylation sites clearly seen at N331 and N343 ( Figure S5 ). CR3022 attaches to the RBD surface orthogonal to the ACE2 receptor binding site. There is no overlap between the epitopes and indeed both the Fab and ACE2 ectodomain can bind without clashing ( Figure   1d ) (Tian et al., 2020) . Such independence of the ACE2 binding site has been reported recently for another SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody, 47D11 . The Fab complex interface buries 990 \u00c5 2 of surface area (600 and 390 \u00c5 2 by the heavy and light chains respectively, Figure 2a and Figure S6 ), somewhat more than the RBD-ACE2 interface which covers 850 \u00c5 2 (PDB 6M0J (Lan et al., 2020) ). Typical of a Fab complex, the interaction is mediated by the antibody CDR loops, which fit well into the rather sculpted surface of the RBD (Figure 1b , c). The heavy chain CDR1, 2 and 3 make contacts to residues from \u03b1 2, \u03b2 2 and \u03b1 3 (residues 369-386), while two of the light chain CDRs (1 and 2) interact mainly with residues from the \u03b2 2-\u03b13 loop, \u03b1 3 (380-392) and the \u03b1 5-\u03b24 loop (427-430) (Figures 1, S1, S7). A total of 16 residues from the heavy chain and 14 from the light chain cement the interaction with 26 residues from the RBD. For the heavy chain these potentially form 7 H-bonds and 3 salt bridges, the latter from D55 and E57 (CDR2) to K378 of the RBD.",

In the structure of the pre-fusion form of trimeric Spike the majority of RBDs are 'down', although presumably stochastically one may be 'up' (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . The structure of a SARS-CoV complex with ACE2 ectodomain shows that this 'up' configuration is competent to bind receptor, and that there are a family of 'up' orientations with significantly different hinge angles (Song et al., 2018) . However, the CR3022 epitope remains largely inaccessible even in the 'up' configuration. Modelling the rotation of the RBD required to enable Fab interaction in the context of the Spike trimer, showed a rotation corresponding to a > 60\u00b0 further declination from the central vertical axis was required, beyond that observed previously (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) (Figure 3i ), although this might be partly mitigated by more complex movements of the RBD and if more than one RBD is in the 'up' configuration this requirement would be relaxed somewhat. Since locking the up state by receptor blocking antibodies is thought to destabilise the pre-fusion state (Walls et al., 2019) binding of CR3022 presumably introduces further destabilisation, leading to a premature conversion to the post-fusion state, inactivating the virus. CR3022 and ACE2 blocking antibodies can bind 9 independently but both induce an 'up' conformation, presumably explaining the observed synergy between binding at the two sites (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "synergy has been described forSARS-CoV (Ter Meulen et al., 2006)). Moreover, it has been reported(Wan et al., 2019) that antibody mediated enhancement occurs via antibodies that mimic receptor attachment whereas CR3022-like binding might circumvent this by preattachment conversion to the post-fusion state. Finally, display of this epitope on an RBDbased vaccine antigen might focus immune responses, conceivably mitigating the immunopathology reported for SARS-CoV(Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Tseng et al.Two vectors were constructed containing resident human C\u03ba and IgG1 CH1 sequences and a signal sequence. Synthetic genes encoding the constant regions were inserted by Infusion\u00ae cloning into PmeI-HindIII cut pOPING-ET(Nettleship et al., 2008). The vectors have been engineered so that VL and VH sequences can be inserted into the KpnI-BsiWI (pOPINhuVL) and KpnI-SfoI (pOPINhuVH) restriction sites by Infusion\u00ae cloning.Synthetic genes encoding the candidate variable regions of CR3022(Ter Meulen et al., 2006) for neutralisation: The heavy and kappa light variable genes of the antibody were sourced from the Genbank ABA54613.1 and ABA54614.1 respectively and the codon optimised sequences were synthesized by GeneArt. These sequences were cloned into Antibody expression vectors (Genbank FJ475055 and FJ475056). Antibody was expressed using ExpiCHO expression system (LifeTechnologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol and purified using a Protein A MabSelect SuRE column (GE Healthcare). The wash buffer contained 20mM Tris & 150mM NaCl buffered to pH 8.6 and the elution was done using 0.1 M Citric acid pH 2.5. The eluate was neutralised immediately using 1.5 M Tris pH 8.6 and then buffer exchanged to PBS using a 15 ml 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (Merck Millipore).RBD: The gene encoding amino acids 330-532 of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (Gene ID: MN908947) was amplified from a synthetic gene (and inserted into the vector pOPINTTGneo incorporating either a C-terminal His6 or BirA-His6 tag. ACE2: The gene encoding amino acids 19-615 of the human ACE2 was amplified from a an image clone (Sourcebiosciences, clone ID: 5297380) using the forward primer 5'-GCGTAGCTGAAACCGGCTCCACCATTGAGGAACAGGCC-3' and the reverse primer 5'-GTGATGGTGATGTTTGTCTGCATATGGACTCCAGTC-3' and inserted into the vector the vector pOPINTTGneo incorporating a C-terminal His6. The gene was also incorporating a C-terminal hIgG1Fc-His6 tag. Spike ectodomain: The gene encoding amino acids 1-1208 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein ectodomain, with mutations of RRAR > GSAS at residues 682-685 (the furin cleavage site) and KV > PP at residues 986-987, as well as inclusion of a T4 fibritin trimerisation domain, a HRV 3C cleavage site, a His-6 tag and a Twin-Strep-tag at the Cterminus. As reported by Wrapp et al. (Wrapp et al., 2020) Validation and protein production: All vectors were sequenced to confirm clones were correct. Recombinant RBD, ACE2, CR3022 Fab and CR3022 IgG were transiently expressed in Expi293\u2122 (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK) and proteins were purified from culture supernatants by an immobilised metal affinity using an automated protocol implemented on an \u00c4KTAxpress (GE Healthcare, UK) (Nettleship et al., 2009), followed by a Hiload 16/60 superdex 75 or a Superdex 200 10/300GL column, using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 buffer. Recombinant Spike ectodomain was expressed by transient transfection in HEK293S GnTI-cells (ATCC CRL-3022) for 9 days at 30 \u00b0C. Conditioned media was dialysed against 2x phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 buffer. The Spike ectodomain was purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography using Talon resin (Takara Bio) charged with cobalt followed by size exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN 3 at 4 \u00b0C, before buffer exchange into 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl (Wrapp et al., 2020). P20 (GE Healthcare) at 25 \u00b0C. To determine the binding kinetics between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and CR3022 mAb, two different experimental settings were attempted. The first experiment was performed with the use of a CAP sensor chip (GE Healthcare). Biotin CAPture Reagent provided in the Biotin CAPture Kit (GE Healthcare) was captured onto the sensor chip according to manufacturer's instructions. The RBD with a BirA tag was biotinylated using a biotinylation kit (Avidity, LLC) and was immobilized through the Biotin CAPture Reagent, at a density of 15-30 RU on the sample flow cell. The reference flow cell was left blank. The CR3022 Fab was injected over the two flow cells at a range of five concentrations prepared by serial two-fold dilution from 95 nM, at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc L/min using a Single-cycle kinetics program with an association time of 60 s and a dissociation time of 60 s. Running buffer was also injected using the same program for background subtraction. The second experiment was performed using a Sensor Chip Protein A (GE Healthcare). CR3022 IgG was immobilised at a density of approximately 30 RU on the sample flow cell. The reference flow cell was left blank. The RBD was injected over the two flow cells at a range of five concentrations prepared by serial two-fold dilution from 100 nM, at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc L/min using a Single-cycle kinetics program with an association time of 75 s and a dissociation time of 60 s. Running buffer was also injected using the same program for background subtraction. All data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using the Biacore T200 Evaluation Software 3.1. In the competition assay where CR3022 IgG was used as the ligand, approximately 1000 RU of CR3022 IgG was immobilised onto a Sensor Chip Protein A. The following samples were injected: (1) 1 \u00b5M ACE2, (2) 1 \u00b5M (anti-Caspr2) E08R Fab; (3) a mixture of 1 \u00b5M ACE2 and 0.1 \u00b5M RBD, (4) a mixture of 1 \u00b5M of 1 \u00b5M E08R Fab and 0.1 \u00b5M RBD, and (4) 0.1 \u00b5M RBD. All injections were performed with an association time of 60 s and a dissociation time of 600 s. All curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.",

The software suite Vagabond was used to convert the 2 0 atomic model into a bond-based description suited for low resolution refinement (Ginn, submitted). This described the protein model through a series of identical but positionally displaced conformers (referred to as an ensemble). The flexibility was described through whole-molecule translations and rotations per polypeptide chain and intramolecular flexibility through variation in torsion angles of bonds connecting C-alpha atoms. These torsion variations were constrained, with bonds of a similar effect on the flexibility of the protein structure moving in tandem. A global B factor of 130 was applied to the model to account for most of the disorder in the crystal. Alternate rounds of refinement were performed of (a) these flexibility parameters and (b) rigid body refinement of each polypeptide chain, for both the target function was the correlation coefficient with the electron density in real space. Local adjustments of atoms were performed in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) using the Vagabond map and average model output coordinates. After local real-space refinement, updated coordinates were reloaded into Vagabond and bond torsion angles were adjusted to match them. Best electron density maps accounting for sources of phase error were output as a list of Fourier coefficients. Maps were sharpened by applying a B factor of -100 (",
