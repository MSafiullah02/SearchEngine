            "text": "Potentially relevant to the recent appearance of COVID-19 in China is the fact that there is a belt of selenium deficiency running from northeast to southwest in the country and, indeed, China has populations that have both the lowest and the highest selenium status in the world (1) . A set of interesting studies published by the Beck laboratory in the 1990s showed that host selenium deficiency increased the virulence of RNA viruses such as coxsackievirus B3 and influenza A (2, 3) . Passage through a selenium-deficient animal that was unable to produce sufficient antioxidant selenoproteins for its own protection resulted in the virus mutating to a virulent form that caused more severe pathology (2, 3) . Those findings shed light on a human selenium-deficiency disease, a cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease, named after the area in northeast China where it was endemic. The disease showed a seasonal variation, suggesting a viral cofactor that was later identified as coxsackievirus B3 (2) . When the population was supplemented with selenium, the incidence of Keshan disease decreased dramatically (1, 2) .",

Indeed, multiple cellular and viral mechanisms involving selenium and selenoproteins could influence viral pathogenicity, including virally encoded selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases [reviewed in (14, 15) ]. Such viral mechanisms could contribute to the well-documented oxidative stress associated with many RNA virus infections (2, 5, 6, 14, 15) ; increased viral replication (hence increased mutation rate); and observed higher pathogenicity or mortality under selenium deficiency, as reported here for SARS-CoV-2.",

The association between hair selenium and COVID-19 cure rate that we note is based on city population selenium status data, mostly dating from 2011, although some data are considerably older. Furthermore, we were unable to collect city-or patient-level data for the following likely confounders: age and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer (16) . We also lack information on variation in medical facilities and therapy protocols (including the use of traditional Chinese medicine or anti-viral therapies). Clearly, we were not able to adjust for these possible confounders in the analysis.",
