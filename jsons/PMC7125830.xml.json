Forty-seven different serotypes of Ad have been characterized, one third of which are associated with a variety of human diseases (Horwitz, 1990). Although effective, oral enteric-coated vaccines can prevent diseases by Ad serotypes 4 and 7, these vaccines are used only in the military and are not licensed for administration to civilians. The common adenovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 5, which infect children, have not been attenuated. In spite of promising results achieved with some nucleoside analogues, such as [(S)-HPMPA], 2\u2032nor-cyclic GMP, cidofovir (see Fig. 2\n) and ganciclovir, against adenoviral infections in in vitro (Gordon et al., 1991) and in vivo animal models (Trousdale et al., 1994), none of these are yet available for clinical use. Interferons may also have a beneficial effect (Mistchenko and Falcoff, 1987), but their large-scale synthesis is prohibitively expensive. Thus, a serious need exists for the development of specific agents to treat adenovirus-induced diseases in humans.",

Compounds with IC50s of micromolar range against Ad 5 and Ad 8 have been found (Hui et al., 1994). Hence, it was postulated that synthesis of new SB-AHGs with proper structural features could yield potent, useful antiviral agents. Two independent studies published earlier had indicated that heterocyclic systems, particularly the pyridine and isoquinoline derivatives, had superior biological activities to those of other aromatic and heteroaromatic systems (Blanz et al., 1970, Spector et al., 1991). It was also noted that of the SB-AHGs synthesized using benzaldehyde, salicylaldehyde, picolinaldehyde and isoquinolinaldehyde, single ring aromatic and heterocyclic compounds apparently had better antiviral activities than bulkier SB-AHGs. Thus, to confirm this hypothesis, two new heterocyclic SB-AHGs containing the picolinaldehyde ring system were synthesized, and screened along with nine other heterocyclic SB-AHGs for anti-adenoviral and anti-herpesviral activity.",

After incubating at 37\u00b0C for 2 h with frequent rocking, the viral inoculum was removed and monolayers were washed three times with Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution. Six wells received 2 ml of growth medium containing 150 \u03bcM of compound I; another six wells received growth medium with no drug. The cell cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. At periodic intervals (24, 48 and 72 h) after infection, duplicate samples from each group were collected separately by scraping the cells off the plate and freezing the cells and supernatant at \u221270\u00b0C. Samples were harvested at 72 h postinfection, freeze-thawed twice and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to remove the cellular debris. The supernatants were serially diluted and titrated in A549 cell monolayers to ascertain the virus titers. For virus yield of HSV-1, a similar procedure was adopted using Vero cell monolayers in a 12-well plate inoculated with approximately 106 pfu per well and treated with 100 \u03bcM of compound I. The virus yield was plotted against hours postinfection, using Microsoft Excel Ver 5.0 (Microsoft Excel, 1993). The results are shown in Fig. 4\n.",

Using the growth medium, selected compounds were serially diluted from the stock to obtain concentrations ranging from 0.01 \u03bcM to a maximum of 300 \u03bcM (in the case of ADL 1), based on results of preliminary cytotoxicity studies. The A549 and Vero cells were grown in 24-well tissue culture plates to approximately 70% confluency.

After 2 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, when the monolayers were nearly confluent, medium was removed, the monolayers were trypsinized, and the cells counted using a Coulter counter. Data were converted to determine % live cells, and dose response curves were plotted to determine TC50 using the same program used for determining IC50 values. Selectivity index, a measure of the margin of safety of the anti-viral agent, was then determined as a ratio TC50/IC50. Results are shown in Table 1.",

A higher concentration (approximately three times the IC50) of the compound was used because compound I was nontoxic to A549 and Vero cells at concentrations of up to 150 \u03bcM and because a higher multiplicity of infection of the viruses was being used in these assays. Approximately 106 pfu of each virus was used to infect the cell monolayers instead of the 100 pfu that is typically used in the plaque reduction assay. The advantage of this assay is its usefulness in studying the effect of an antiviral agent on the virus growth cycle at a high-input multiplicity of the challenging virus.",

The yield of infectious virus was maximally reduced by about 2 logs at 24 h post infection, after which there was an apparent increase in the number of virus particles in the treated cells at almost the same rate as in the control cells. These results resemble an earlier study with Ad 8 and structurally similar compounds (Hui et al., 1994), and support the observation that SB-AHGs probably inhibit an early stage of virus replication. However, in the HSV-1 virus yield reduction assay (Fig. 4 b), there was no apparent reduction in yield with compound I 24 h post infection; but there was a modest reduction (sevenfold) at 48 h and a reduction of 25-fold (more than one log unit) at 72 h.

All five SB-AHGs with MW < 235 (compounds I\u2013III, V, VI) in group I were found to be noncytotoxic at the 100 \u03bcM concentration in both cell lines. Only one (compound IV) of six SB-AHGs in group I have MW>235, but still noncytotoxic at 100 \u03bcM concentration. In contrast, all five group II SB-AHGs with MW>235 (compounds VII\u2013XI) are cytotoxic at 100 \u03bcM (Table 1). The present work further supports our hypothesis that smaller compounds (MW of approximately 170\u2013220 for the free SB) are generally less cytotoxic and potentially better antiviral agents than the bulkier compounds (Wang et al., 1990). Compounds VII\u2013XI (with MW\u2019s of 235\u2013315 for the free Schiff bases) were highly cytotoxic to the host cells, and thus, they may have potential as effective antitumor agents since cytotoxicity against transformed cells is an important feature of antitumor activity. In fact, earlier studies with these SB-AHGs (compounds VII\u2013XI) did demonstrate potent antineoplastic activities for some compounds (T\u2019ang et al., 1985, Koneru et al., 1993). Compounds VII and VIII had IC50 values of 6.8 and 3.3 \u03bcM, respectively, in cultured L1210 murine leukemia cell lines (T\u2019ang et al., 1985). Compounds IX and XI had potent cytotoxicities in CCRF-CEM/0 human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, with IC50 values of 7.1 and 3.0 \u03bcM, respectively (Koneru et al., 1993).",

However, the antiviral activities of substituted SB-AHGs may or may not be due to RR inhibition alone since these compounds are effective against DNA viruses (adenovirus, Hui et al., 1994), RNA viruses (coronavirus or murine hepatitis virus, MHV, Wang et al., 1990) and the RNA tumor viruses (Rous sarcoma virus, RSV, Tai et al., 1984). An earlier study showed that while the antitumor activities of SB-AHGs correlate significantly with RR inhibition, no such correlation exists between RR inhibition and antiviral activity in a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of SB-AHGs against the growth of L1210 cells and transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by RSV in vitro (Lien et al., 1989).
