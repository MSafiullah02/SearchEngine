Patients present with painful or itchy erythematous-edematous lesions of the extremities, sometimes evolving to blistering. This presentation is similar to what it is commonly seen in chilblains. The word \"chilblains\" itself etymologically refers to cold exposure (chill = cold, blain = sore). The term chilblain-like lesions, in our opinion, therefore would be preferable for the lesions that present in these patients rather than acro-ischemic lesions. In addition, histopathology of these lesions is quite similar to chilblains, with an absence of true necrosis; this is different to what it is typically found in hospitalized patients 4 .",
