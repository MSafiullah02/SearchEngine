            "text": "Soil, commonly viewed as a non-renewable resource due to the extremely slow pace of its regeneration, is under serious threat from modern society (Amundson et al., 2015). Soil degradation occurs due to factors such as water erosion, wind erosion, salinization, and deforestation (Carlson et al., 2012; Celentano et al., 2017; Rojas et al., 2016). Activities that introduce polluting substances, such as heavy metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are further causing wide-spread soil degradation. Globally, it is estimated that ~24 billion metric tons of soil are lost through factors such as erosion each year (UNCCD, 2017) and that ~30% of the world's soils are now in a degraded state (FAO, 2011). In China, ~19% of agricultural soil and ~ 16% of all soils exceed national soil quality standards (MEP, 2014). Soil degradation threatens the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Bouma, 2019). To help address soil degradation, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization declared 2015\u20132024 as the International Decade of Soils, aiming to raise public awareness of soil protection. Since then, there has been a burgeoning trend of scientific literature and public debate on soil.",

There is also a growing recognition that soil health relates not only to the classical biogeophysical processes that are traditionally studied by soil scientists, but also information management, knowledge sharing, and human behavior (Bampa et al., 2019; Bouma et al., 2019). Interdisciplinary studies (see Section 2.3) are required to understand better the coupling of complex human-nature systems linked to soil management (Bouma and Montanarella, 2016). However, current knowledge on soil processes is scattered across various disciplines, lacking comprehensive views on the sustainable management of soil resources (Vogel et al., 2018).",

These include, among others, no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, clean water and sanitation and climate action (UN, 2015). The SDGs have become a central theme of global development and international collaboration. Considerable progress has been made in recent years toward reaching the SDGs. For example, the proportion of the global population with access to safe drinking water and the percentage of children receiving vaccinations have both risen considerably. However, many challenges still exist, such as: 821 million people remain undernourished, representing a 5% increase between 2015 and 2017; investment in agriculture from governmental sources and foreign aid has dropped; and, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) continue to rise (UN, 2019), exacerbating the current climate crisis. Governments from local to national levels need to develop integrated programs addressing these sustainability challenges (Bryan et al., 2018).",

Most people in poverty live in rural areas where crop production is a vital source of income. In these areas, soil health is a decisive factor for productivity and income levels. Among other roles, soil provides the basis for food production and ecosystem services (Bender et al., 2016; Oliver and Gregory, 2015). Moreover, as soil biodiversity is related to lower crop diseases and pests, the ecological services offered by healthy soil systems are important in reducing poverty and ending hunger. Soil also affects water quality, GHG emissions, and other important environmental considerations in regard to the SDGs (Bharati et al., 2002; Franzluebbers, 2005).

Because soil plays such a critical role in multiple natural and anthropogenic systems, such soil properties will affect ecosystem services, environmental quality, agricultural sustainability, climate change, and human health. This multi-functional aspect makes traditional soil quality evaluation systems, which have tended to focus on soil fertility and agricultural production (Doran and Parkin, 1994), no longer fully appropriate. Most recently, the \u201csoil health\u201d concept has been the subject of increasing research attention (see Fig. 2\n). This holistic approach accounts for non-linear mechanistic relationships between various physical, chemical, and biological properties. Moreover, the soil health holistic concept is advantageous over traditional soil quality assessments because it considers ecosystem services as well as agricultural production, i.e., both nature and human driven objectives (Kibblewhite et al., 2008).",

The authors argued that soil health is a holistic concept which portrays soil as a living system (i.e., the capacity of soil to function as a living system), while soil quality describes a soil's capacity for a specific use (i.e., fitness for different uses). The outcomes of soil use and management decisions are reflected in soil health (Doran and Safley, 1997).",

We must develop an interdisciplinary approach to address these challenges (Totsche et al., 2010). It should be noted that interdisciplinary approaches differ from multidisciplinary approaches, in that they integrate insights on a common problem (e.g. climate change) from different disciplines (e.g. soil science and climate science) to construct a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

We propose that five broad issues have a root in soil science and are linked to at least one other discipline. The issues themselves are also interconnected. Take management and behavior as an example, which is directly linked to soil science and social science. At the same time, soil fertility and soil pollution are also involved, which are directly linked to agronomy and environmental science, respectively. Another example is soil carbon (or soil organic matter) which is directly linked to both soil science and climate science while also affecting soil biodiversity linked to ecology, and soil fertility linked to agronomy. In a sense, the network shown on Fig. 3 forms a complex six-disciplinary system, which can be used for studying soil sustainability.",

Scientific evidence from in-depth studies is often scattered within various disciplines that use technical jargon that is little understood by the social scientists or journalists who are engaged in information transmittal and knowledge sharing. Modern electronic information sharing techniques, including social media tools (e.g., Twitter and Facebook), make mass information distribution easier (Mills et al., 2019), but they can also make it difficult for lay people to distinguish between evidence-based reliable information and inaccurate or even misleading information. A parallel example occurred during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, during which large amounts of misinformation were transmitted across social media.

This is particularly important for the application of soil science.

In Australia, the New South Wales local government uses webinars to disseminate soil science information to a geographically disperse community of practice (CoP) (Jenkins et al., 2019). Grain advisors, however, were reported to be guiding farmers to historically established \u201crules of thumb\u201d for calculating nitrogen fertilizer needs, rather than the latest evidence-based science on soil water and nitrogen management (Schwenke et al., 2019). Another Australian local government decided to share soil information and knowledge using a website coupled with training workshops. The type of information shared may include soil properties and landscape characteristics obtained from field assessment studies. Such initiatives show that centralized knowledge sharing can bring significant tangible benefits (Imhof et al., 2019). However, a 10-year follow-up survey showed that while training workshops could be effective in the short term, behavioral change was not sustained in the long term. It was suggested that continuing professional development to upskill farm advisors and the CoP may render a more persistent uptake of knowledge at the farm level (Andersson and Orgill, 2019).",

Therefore, there is a growing interest to integrate social components and farmer behavior with the ecological component of soil management (Amin et al., 2019). In modern society, with the fast-growing use of various types of information technology, farmer behavior can be influenced by different network-based approaches. For instance, a study in Europe found that farmers formed a learning network by sharing information and soil knowledge on the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter. This platform has a limited length for each message (280 characters for non-Asian languages), making it easy for time-constrained farmers to follow (Mills et al., 2019). In the US, an integrated network-based approach enabled a quarter of respondents to adopt cover crops for weed control, and respondents also increased their follow-up usage from information shared on Twitter (22%), YouTube (23%), and web sites (21%) (Wick et al., 2019).",

In Europe, a knowledge gap regarding sustainable soil management was identified as a major issue among both farmers and soil advisors. As the current trend of privatization and decentralization of advisory services continues, there is an increasing need to educate those who provide advisory services, thus enabling effective empowerment of farmers (Ingram and Mills, 2019). Governments ought also to provide workshops that encourage farmers to adopt greater soil testing, so that they can then make informed soil management decisions (Lobry de Bruyn, 2019).",

Their action can enhance the robustness of scientific knowledge creation and broaden its applicability by incorporating evidence into policy instruments. In Scotland, soil risk maps are created by scientists, policy makers and industrial representatives working in close collaboration (Baggaley et al., 2020). Similarly, in Australia, soil constraints maps have been produced for site-specific management (van Gool, 2016). Such tools can help mitigate constraints to achieving climate-driven genetic yield potential of agricultural crops. Models that incorporate learnings from stakeholder engagement can also render strong predictive power (Inam et al., 2017). Traditionally, the main channel of soil knowledge generation has been government funded. However, there has been a general decreasing trend in the provision of government funds for soil data collection in many developed countries, while privately funded collection of soil information has increased dramatically (Robinson et al., 2019). Under this situation, it is even more important to bring in additional stakeholders to create and share soil knowledge. The Soil Knowledge Network (SKN) in Australia demonstrated that ex-governmental soil scientists can exert long-lasting positive impacts by coaching new generations of early career soil scientists (McInnes-Clarke et al., 2019).",

Recently, increasing attention has been placed on SOC beyond the traditional sphere of soil science. This is because it is a key component of Earth's carbon cycle, thus having huge implications for the current climate crisis (Kell, 2012) and SDG13: Climate action. Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, holding an estimated 1500\u20132400 GtC and permafrost (i.e. frozen soil) storing 1700 GtC (Le Quere et al., 2018). A global initiative known as \u20184 per 1000\u2019, which aims to increase soil organic carbon by 0.4% per year, would result in an additional carbon storage of 1.2 GtC per year if successful (Paustian et al., 2016; Rumpel et al., 2018). In Australia, surface soils provide a significant reservoir of carbon, holding ~19 billion metric tons. However, most of these soils (~75%) contain <1% SOC, suggesting huge additional capacity for carbon sequestration. An annual 0.8% increase in carbon storage across all Australian surface soils would fully offset the nation's GHG emissions (Baldock et al., 2010)",

Thus, applying organic amendments, including biosolids and composts, to agricultural land can increase carbon storage and contribute significantly to offsetting GHG emissions. Studies have shown that manure can potentially increase crop yields and soil organic contents in comparison with mineral fertilizers (Jing et al., 2019). A 37-year field study showed that organic fertilization increased soil carbon input by 25% to 80%, although levels of carbon retention ranged from only 1.6% for green manure to 13.7% for fresh cattle manure (Maltas et al., 2018). Similarly, Bolan et al. (2013) demonstrated that biosolid applications likely result in higher levels of carbon sequestration compared to other management strategies including fertilizer application and conservation tillage. This was attributed to an increased microbial biomass, and Fe and Al oxide-induced immobilization of carbon (Bolan et al., 2013). In comparison with open-air systems, the use of organic fertilizers for indoor greenhouse soils may have a greater positive influence on soil functionality due to its effect on porosity and pore connectivity (Xu et al., 2019). It should be noted that organic fertilizers may not increase crops yields to the levels achievable with inorganic fertilizers. This issue can be overcome by supplementing organic fertilizers with inorganic ones (Maltas et al., 2018).",

            "text": "A variety of conservation farming practices can increase SOC levels, while also increasing crop productivity and decreasing water demand (Kumar et al., 2019; Mehra et al., 2018). Crop residue return to surface soils can have a positive effect on soil carbon sequestration (Chowdhury et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019b). For example, chopping and returning wheat straw and corn stover can increase SOC levels by 14.5% in a double-cropping system (Zhao et al., 2019). Reduced tillage and non-tillage practices can also increase soil SOC levels (Chatskikh et al., 2008; Lafond et al., 2011). For example, a 22-year study showed that with no tillage, mulch treatment had a significantly positive effect on carbon retention (Kahlon et al., 2013). Integrated methods have the potential to achieve even more significant increases in SOC levels. For example, SOC data collected over 35 years in a semi-arid region of China showed that carbon levels were enhanced (by 453% to 757%) using a combination of best practice cultivation, mulching, and planting methods (Guoju et al., 2020). Different land uses also affect SOC, not only in terms of concentration, but also the fractions of SOC that are vulnerable to mineralization (Ramesh et al., 2019). For example, labile and humified SOC fractions have been reported to be more prone to mineralization in arable lands than in grasslands (Ukalska-Jaruga et al., 2019).",

These characteristics enable biochar to enhance soil moisture content, sorb polluting substances and increase soil pH (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2019). Moreover, biochar is considered carbon negative because the carbon within its structure, which is captured from the atmosphere during biomass formation, is more recalcitrant in the natural environment than carbon in biomass that has not been pyrolized. Because of its carbon negativity and beneficial properties for soil management, biochar has been proposed as a possible technology to help mitigate climate change (Woolf et al., 2010). Numerous studies have explored the usage of biochar in croplands (Laird et al., 2010b), while recent studies have also examined its application in other systems, such as alpine grassland (Rafiq et al., 2019).",

Therefore, researchers have conducted extensive research on the benefits biochar for agricultural and environmental purposes.

A recent meta-analysis found that in comparison with inorganic fertilizer alone, biochar can increase crop yields by 11% to 19% (95% confidence intervals) (Ye et al., 2020). Biochar has also been put forward as a sustainable technique for remediating soils degraded by contaminants, especially heavy metals (Hou, 2020; O'Connor et al., 2018c; Song et al., 2019). The sustainability of biochar is increased if the biomass feedstock is a biological waste that would otherwise be burned or discarded at landfill, thus avoiding air pollution or the consumption of landfill space. However, while a myriad of studies have shown biochar applications have positive effects on soil, it should be noted that such effects may diminish after 3\u2013 5 years (Dong et al., 2019). Biochar effectiveness and longevity may be enhanced by the invention of engineered biochars (O'Connor et al., 2018b).",

Reducing the emission of such GHGs is one of the greatest challenges for sustainable farming (de Ara\u00fajo Santos et al., 2019) and the achievement of SDG13: Climate action. Soil CO2 emissions are affected by agricultural practice (e.g. tillage and fertilizer application), as well as the soil properties (e.g. soil texture). For sandy soils, greater macroporosity tends to be associated with higher CO2 emissions, while microporosity is associated with lower emissions, which likely related to their respective tortuosity levels (Farhate et al., 2019; Tavares et al., 2015). The use of lime to treat low pH soils may also relate to CO2 emissions. Therefore, sustainable management of low pH grasslands may involve the use of low liming dosage rates, which provide almost the same result as higher rates (Bolan et al., 2003; Kunhikrishnan et al., 2016; Lochon et al., 2019). A study in Denmark showed that reduced tillage practice can decrease net GHG emissions by 0.56 Mg CO2-eq. ha\u22121 per year; moreover, the use of disc coulters that minimally disturb soil can reduce net GHG emissions by 1.84 Mg CO2-eq. ha\u22121 per year (Chatskikh et al., 2008).",

An early study found that the application of rice straw to paddy fields increased CH4 emissions by a factor of 1.8 to 3.5 (Yagi and Minami, 1990). Recently, methane emissions from permafrost (permanently frozen soil) has drawn attention from the climate science community, owing to its critical role in carbon cycling (Schuur et al., 2015). As climate change occurs, rising temperature in the polar regions causes permafrost to thaw and microbial activity to increase (Hollesen et al., 2015). This leads to increased methane and CO2 emissions from organic-rich Arctic soils (Schuur et al., 2013). As these gases are associated with increased global warming potential, their emission increases the levels of permafrost thaw, thus forming a positive feedback loop. It is imperative to understand these processes in a quantitative way. As the climate change crisis worsens, it may be necessary to take mitigating measures involving soil management in areas associated with high methane fluxes.",

Among other factors, soil microbial communities are affected by the availability of nutrients corresponding to the type of soil management practice (Bolan et al., 1996; Lauber et al., 2009; Leff et al., 2015). For example, the use of soluble fertilizers (e.g., monocalcium phosphate), less soluble organic fertilizer (e.g., sugarcane filter cake) or nearly insoluble rock phosphate (Arruda et al., 2019) have different impacts on soil microbial communities. Soil management practices also affect soil hydraulics, which affects plant and microbial biodiversity and ecosystem resilience (Alley et al., 2002; Anderegg et al., 2018). A study in India reported that integrating crop residue return with green manure application and no-tillage in a rice-wheat double cropping system increased SOC levels by 13%, the microbial biomass by 38%, the basal soil respiration rate by 33%, and the microbial quotient by 30% (Saikia et al., 2020). Certain soil amendments are associated with increased soil biodiversity. For example, biochar amendment of a Mediterranean vineyard soil decreased the mineralization of both SOC and microbial biomass, while the functional microbial diversity and biodiversity of soil micro-arthropods were maintained (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2019). Soil properties and biodiversity are also affected by plant root systems within the rhizosphere (Dey et al., 2012).",

This value takes into account major ecosystem services, such as agricultural production, carbon sequestration, recreational usage, and wildlife diversity (Bateman et al., 2013).

Governments may intervene to restore or improve ecological services in limited soil systems. In China, for example, the government has made subsidies available to farmers to protect natural woodlands and convert steep agricultural cropland into other land uses, such as grassland or woodland (Liu et al., 2008). If farmland is degraded to an extent that it is abandoned, soil treatments may help bring about natural revegetation and the recovery of ecosystem services (Li et al., 2019a).

Anthropogenic soil pollution in under-developed regions where industrial activities are less intensive can also occur due to traffic and mining related emissions, etc. For instance, a recent study in a suburban area of Central Asia showed that Pb, Zn, and Cu can accumulate to high levels in soils because of road traffic up to 200 m away (Ma et al., 2019).",

Soil systems that experience net soil erosion can suffer the loss of fertile surface soils, removal of soil organic carbon, and reduced agricultural productivity, thus rendering a high environmental and economic cost globally (Montgomery, 2007a; Pimentel et al., 1995).

If soil nutrients or contaminants are leached from surface soils, they can transport into the subsurface via the vertical migration of infiltration water.

The potential for soil leaching is also affected by soil management practices that alter the chemical composition of soil. For instance, liming is a common farming method to increase soil pH and reduce flocculation. However, recent studies have suggested that soil particle surfaces become more negatively charged as soil pH increases. Therefore, liming activity may lead to soil-bound harmful substances, such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), leaching from soil and entering groundwater systems (Oliver et al., 2019). In New Zealand, intensified agricultural production on steep landscapes, which is encouraged by the government's policy to significantly increase agricultural exports, has involved the replacement of perennial pastures with winter forage crops. This has increased the use agrochemicals, including glyphosate and diazinon, which not only pose an environmental risk in themselves, but also facilitate the leaching of organic carbon and nitrogen (Chibuike et al., 2019). The reporting of such unintended consequences reinforces the importance of comprehensive assessments for sustainable soil use and management. It should be noted that certain soil amendments, such as biochar, have been shown to reduce soil nutrient leaching potential (Laird et al., 2010a).",

However, neither the scientific community nor policy makers have paid sufficient attention to soil in their SDG efforts. Soil scientists have not been adequately involved in the discussion on SDG targets and indicators (Bouma et al., 2019). Consequently, while there are four SDG targets that specifically mention soil, and others that indirectly relate to soil, only one explicit soil indicator has been established (Bouma et al., 2019). The lack of involvement by soil scientists may be due to their strong focus on pure soil science, rather than conducting cross-disciplinary and elaborate discussions on big picture soil related issues with other stakeholders. To help provide effective SDG solutions, it is imperative to encourage interdisciplinary soil research among soil scientists and researchers in fields relating to social science, climate science, ecology, and environmental science. When national and local governments form policies according to the United Nations SDGs, soil scientists need to be encouraged to play a more active role, and their advice needs to be sought by decision makers. For instance, by nominating soil scientists to key steering committees.",

For example, regional estimates of soil organic carbon stocks have differed by as much as 60% on different scales due to this heterogeneity (Illiger et al., 2019). There is little known about the vertical distribution of organic carbon in the subsurface (Balesdent et al., 2018). As large amounts of carbon are stored in deep soils (Yu et al., 2019), it is essential to understand the status, as well as the mechanisms, of soil carbon cycling across the full extent of the lithosphere.",

To achieve this goal, soil health needs to be evaluated under site-specific conditions that account for the different processes of different geological, climatic, and societal conditions (Vogel et al., 2018). This would be particularly valuable for aiding farmers with decision making and translating soil science into practical sustainable soil use and management practice. Moreover, to support policy making processes, it is necessary to map soil properties on a regional scale, or even on national and global scales. High resolution mapping and clustering of soil properties would enable targeted recommendations for sustainable soil management (Donoghue et al., 2019). It should also be noted that while many existing soil sustainability studies have focused on the impacts of socioeconomic activities (i.e. soil management) on soil systems (i.e. soil health), studies regarding the impacts of soil systems on socioeconomic systems are less common (Vogel et al., 2018).",
