            "text": "With approximately a million cancer\u2010caused deaths per year, oncogenic viruses are a major cause of cancer\u2010related mortality; indeed, approximately 10% to 18% of human malignancies are linked to viruses, globally.1, 2 To date, 7 human viruses, namely, HCV, HBV, HPV, EBV, HTLV\u20101, Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpes virus (KSHV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) have been etiologically involved in the development of human cancers.3 In addition, there are other viruses implicated in human carcinogenesis whose causal roles have yet to be fully confirmed.4 To prevent and manage viral\u2010mediated cancers appropriately, the molecular events underlying the interactions between both oncogenic viruses and cells should be clearly understood. Transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2010\u03b2 signaling pathway is a key signaling network, with a diverse range of pathophysiological activities, playing essential roles in processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumorigenesis.5 Accordingly, it is not surprising that its loss of regulation can contribute to a broad range of pathologies such as cancer.6, 7 In this regard, the present review focuses on describing the modulation of this pivotal pathway by either tumor\u2010caused or tumor\u2010associated viruses. It first outlines the key aspects of the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway, before focusing on the existing literature on the subject of viral interference with TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling.",

            "text": "TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling plays vital roles in both biological processes and diseases. Regarding tumorigenesis, it exhibits a dual role by demonstrating anti\u2010tumor effects (through inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis) and pro\u2010oncogenic activities (via inducing EMT and tumor metastasis) during early and late stages of oncogenesis, respectively.6, 8 This pathway mediates its functions through TGF\u2010\u03b2 cytokines whose binding to type II and type I serine\u2010threonine kinase receptors (known as TGFbRI and TGFbRII, respectively) results in the activation of 2 different downstream pathways; SMAD\u2010dependent and SMAD\u2010independent pathways.9 Indeed, the effects of TGF\u2010\u03b2 are often controlled by 3 TGF\u03b2 ligands, TGF\u2010\u03b21, TGF\u2010\u03b22, and TGF\u2010\u03b23, secreted as latent protein complexes, required to be activated by proteolytic cleavage before binding to receptors.9 Activated TGF\u2010\u03b2 interacts with and activates TGFbRII, leading to the phosphorylation of TGFbRI, whose activation results in signal transduction via recruiting and phosphorylating receptor\u2010regulated SMADs (R\u2010SMAD), SMAD2 and SMAD3, which subsequently interact with Co\u2010SMADs (eg, SMAD4) to form the activated SMADs complex, that thereafter, translocate into the nucleus, wherein it exerts its regulatory effects on the expression of target genes, by recruiting other co\u2010activator or co\u2010repressor factors for transcription (eg, p300, CBP) (Figure 1).10, 11 Furthermore, TGFbRIII is another TGF\u2010\u03b2 receptor, playing a coreceptor role for TGFbRII.12 SMAD\u2010dependent cascade, as the major TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling mediator, conveys signals from TGFbRI to the nucleus in a linear pathway, a process blocked by inhibitory SMADs (I\u2010SMADs); for instance, SMAD7 represses this pathway either via interacting with activated TGFbRI, and hence, preventing R\u2010SMAD activation or through recruiting SMURF2, a ubiquitin\u2010ligase, which promotes SMAD2 and TGFbRI decrease and downmodulates SMAD3 function.10, 13, 14 Perturbations of this cascade can lead to tumorigenesis and tumor promotion via either direct or indirect effects on key cellular process.15 For example, SMAD4 and TGFbRII were shown to be often disrupted by mechanisms such as allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and mutation in multiple carcinomas.16 Similarly, disturbed SMAD4 has also been observed in a number of malignancies, representing a tumor suppressor role for this pathway.17 In addition to the SMADs cascade, which plays the central role,10 TGF\u2010\u03b2 can also interact with other signaling cascades, those mediated independently of the SMAD factors, such as p38 MAP kinases, c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK), Ras\u2010ERK, PI3K\u2010Akt, and small GTPases (eg, RhoA), in a cell type\u2010specific manner.18, 19, 20\n",

            "text": "HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family with a single stranded RNA, acting as a major cause of liver diseases, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients with chronic HCV infection, chronic liver disease (CLD) occurs in 50% of the cases leading to 5% to 20% cirrhosis, of which, 1% to 2% result in HCC, a pathology causing for approximately 600 000 deaths per year.21 Dysregulation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of all stages of the liver diseases,22 a cytokine whose upregulated level has been reported both in liver tissue and serum of patients with chronic HCV infection and HCC.23 Recently, Jee found high levels of expressing TGF\u2010\u03b2 in hepatocytes of HCV patients, as well as, in HCV\u2010infected hepatocytes cultured in vitro, as that of cultured cells was sufficient to activate liver fibrosis\u2010associated cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSC), a new mechanism underlying liver fibrogenesis.24 Accordingly, the HCV E2 protein was reported as cause of this overproduction, by acting through glucose\u2010regulated protein 94 (GRP94) mediated NF\u2010\u03baB activation, which proposed GRP94 as a potential target for preventing HCV\u2010caused liver cirrhosis. Relevant in this regard, other investigations have shown an upregulated level of TGF\u2010\u03b2 either directly by HCV factors, in particular core protein, or via NF\u2010\u03baB and oxidative/ER stress activation.25, 26, 27, 28, 29 Taniguchi indicated TGF\u2010\u03b2 upmodulation at the transcriptional levels by HCV core protein.28 Furthermore, HCV core protein also increases active TGF\u2010\u03b2 levels by thrombospondin (THBS), an anti\u2010angiogenic factor whose function is mediated in part through activating the latent form of TGF\u2010\u03b2, and thus SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, indicating TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling activation.29 Similarly, HCV increases ROS production, which in turn activates the p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK pathways, leading to NF\u03baB activation that induces TGF\u2010\u03b2 production.30 Conversely, HCV NS5A protein was able to block a pivotal transcriptional activator for TGF\u2010\u03b2 gene expression, known as AP\u20101, through interrupting the Ras\u2010ERK pathway.24 In addition to overexpression or activation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 cytokine, HCV also interferes with downstream TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling components and mediators.31, 32, 33 TGF\u2010\u03b2 arrests cell cycle promotion by upmodulation of inhibitory factors such as p21, a key role whose inhibition exerts a fundamental effect on tumor progression.34 Recently, Choi showed HCV NS5A protein acts as a negative modulator, where it interacts with TGFbRI, resulting in inhibition of SMAD2 phosphorylation and SMADs complex formation and then in downmodulation of p21 expression.31 Furthermore, HCV core protein suppresses TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2013induced p21 overexpression in a transcriptional\u2010dependent manner. In fact, HCV core protein functions through the TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010responsive element (T\u03b2RE) positioned in the p21 promoter region to repress the p21 promoter by suppression of TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway; a mechanism by which HCV results in cell growth induction.32 In the same way, Cheng showed 2 physical interactions between the HCV core and NS3 proteins with SMAD3 factor, which was shown to suppress the SMAD3\u2010mediated transcriptional activation of target genes via reducing the SMAD3 binding ability to the SMAD binding elements (SBE) located in the promoter regions.33 Pavio by assessing core variants isolated from both tumoral and non\u2010tumoral tissues of the same HCC patient reported in contrast to tumor derived variants, which block TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling, no such effects were exerted by non\u2010tumoral ones.35 Additionally, their findings demonstrated a direct interaction between core and SMAD3, which in turn inhibited the DNA\u2010binding activity of SMAD3. Hence, it could be concluded that during chronic infection, those viral variants would be selected that provoke cell transformation via enhancing resistance to anti\u2010proliferative activities of TGF\u2010\u03b2. Battaglia similarly found HCC\u2010derived HCV core proteins are capable of shifting TGF\u2010\u03b2 responses from anti\u2010tumor to pro\u2010tumor effects via reducing SMAD3 signaling.36 This duality of function of TGF\u2010\u03b2 in tumorigenesis was also further observed in another study, where a TGFbRI\u2010independent SMAD3 activation by TGF\u2010\u03b2 resulted in a shift of TGF\u2010\u03b2 activity from tumor\u2010suppressor to fibrogenic in HCV\u2010chronically infected patients; in these patients, TGF\u2010\u03b2 activated c\u2010JNK, which in turn phosphorylated SMAD3 into linker\u2010phosphorylated SMAD3 (pSMAD3L) and led to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition via upmodulating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI\u20101), a process, which increased during liver disease course from chronic hepatitis through cirrhosis to HCC.37 Interestingly, HCV may be able to indirectly block TGF\u2010\u03b2 mediated\u2010apoptosis via inducing the PI3K\u2010Akt survival pathway. This PI3K\u2010Akt\u2010mediated survival signal could be directed by NS5A, which is capable of downmodulating PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K\u2010Akt pathway.38 HCV also affects TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling via interacting with SMURF2, a key negative regulator of the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway. HCV NS3\u20104A targets SMURF2, resulting in enhanced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and then in increased TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling, an event, which is inhibited by SMURF2 overexpression.14 Taken together, these observations show how TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling can be both negatively and positively regulated by HCV to affect the pathogenesis of HCV infection outcomes (Figure 2).",

            "text": "HBV is a DNA virus pertained to the Hepadnaviridae family, known as another major risk factor for cirrhosis and HCC progression.39, 40 HBV chronic infection is currently estimated to influence almost 240 million people, globally, of which approximately 10% have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC.4, 41 Similar to HCV, HBV also interacts with the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway, a phenomenon mainly mediated by HBV X protein (HBx), which may exert diverse effects on the pathogenesis of the HBV\u2010mediated liver pathologies7, 21, 42, 43 (Figure 3). Evidence by Murata further supported the hypothesis that the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway is directly involved in liver tumorigenesis, where HBx was shown to switch the target of hepatocytic TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling from the TGFbRI/pSmad3C/p21 anti\u2010tumor pathway to the JNK/pSmad3L/c\u2010Myc tumor supportive pathway in the early stages of liver carcinogenesis.43 Subsequently, the same result was reported by WU investigating the effect of TGF\u2010\u03b2 on HBx\u2010expressing well\u2010differentiated HCC cells.42 As a result, the JNK/pSmad3L pathway can be regarded as a potential candidate toward preventing and treating HBV\u2010mediated HCC. It is thought the upregulated TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway enhances the invasive and metastatic potential of HCC cells, by suppressing E\u2010cadherin expression and promoting https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00247/full (Treg) induction.7, 21, 44 In this respect, Liu suggested a new mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HBV\u2010caused HCC; HBx downmodulates protein phosphatase magnesium\u2010dependent 1A (PPM1a) levels, resulting in overactivation of the TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling pathway.7 In fact, HBx was shown to promote the degradation of PPM1a, a p\u2010Smad2/3 phosphatase required for terminating TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling, through elevating its ubiquitination. Furthermore, Yoo showed HBx upregulates TGF\u2010\u03b2 expression by acting through the Egr transcription factors binding site.45 A study by Lee also demonstrated that HBx directly interacts with SMAD4 leading to the SMAD complex stabilization and enhanced TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling.46 In this way, HBV may affect cancer invasion in HCC, by upmodulating the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway. Moreover, HBx has also been shown to prevent TGF\u2010\u03b2 mediated\u2010apoptosis via upregulating the PI3\u2010kinase signaling pathway activity.47 In addition to HBx, HBV transcripts have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC.48 A recent study demonstrated HBV mRNAs could bind to and absorb microRNA 15a/16 to inhibit apoptosis.49 The importance of this interaction was subsequently highlighted, when the authors interestingly found that SMAD7 acts as a target of miR\u201015a.48 Thus, HBV can increase the level of SMAD7 and then block TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling and corresponding responses (eg, apoptosis) by downmodulating miR\u201015a, an attractive molecular target for therapeutic development.",

            "text": "HPVs are DNA viruses associated with the development of cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers. The majority of cervical cancer is mediated by HPV16 and HPV18 encoding the E6 and E7 oncoproteins.50, 51 There is a close relationship between HPV infection and the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway in cervical tissues; investigations have reported upmodulated TGF\u2010\u03b2 levels in HPV\u2010positive cervical cancers compared with HPV\u2010negative ones and have suggested a positive correlation between the expression levels of TGF\u2010\u03b2 and the HPV E6/E7 oncogenes, which may be due to trans\u2010regulatory functions of the E6/E7 oncoproteins, so that, HPV16 E6/E7 have been shown to enhance TGF\u2010\u03b2 promoter activity by interacting with an Sp1\u2010binding site placed in the TGF\u2010\u03b2 core promoter.52 However, a prominent aspect of malignant transformation in cervical epithelial cells is the progressive loss of TGF\u2010\u03b2 responsiveness.53 In this respect, studies demonstrate a contributing role for HPV in the acquisition of TGF\u2010\u03b2 resistance in cervical cancer (Figure 4). HPV16 E7 interacts with SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 leading to inhibition of SMAD3 binding to its DNA targets and then blocking the pathway.54 HPV16 E5 downregulates the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway by lowering the expression of TGFbRII, as well as, by reducing SMAD2 phosphorylation and SMAD4 nuclear translocation, which may play a crucial role in the HPV\u2010induced cervical carcinogenesis.55 Through decreasing the intracellular levels of TIP\u20102/GIPC, a PDZ protein involved in the expression of TGFbRIII, HPV18 E6 was shown to render HeLa cells less sensitive to the anti\u2010growth activities of TGF\u2010\u03b2.56 HPV16 E7 was also found to interfere with the growth\u2010inhibitory effects of the cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP1, p27KIP1, and p15INKB, which are induced by TGF\u2010\u03b2.57 Furthermore, Mendoza demonstrated a similar activity for HPV5, a causative agent for skin carcinomas; it was shown that HPV5 E6 could bind to SMAD3 and destabilize the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex.58 Similarly, the cutaneous HPV8 and MmuPV1 (a recently detected HPV) E6 proteins interact with SMAD2/SMAD3 and suppress the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway.59 These findings show that how may these interactions be important in the development of HPV\u2010associated tumors, in particular cervical cancer.",

Takanashi reported EBV\u2010encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP\u20101) caused loss of TGF\u2010\u03b2 sensitivity in rodent fibroblasts.64 Arvanitakis earlier had demonstrated LMP\u20101 inhibited TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010mediated growth suppression in EBV\u2010positive B lymphocytes.65 Subsequently, LMP\u20101 was indicated to suppress the activation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling and TGF\u03b2\u2010induced growth suppression via an NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent mechanism.66 Indeed, LMP\u20101 was suggested to activate NF\u2010\u03baB that in turn and in competition with SMAD proteins interacts with the transcriptional coactivator CBP and p300, those factors essential for SMADs to function as transcriptional effectors. In other words, it seems the LMP\u20101\u2010mediated inhibitory effect on SMAD\u2010dependent transcription results from inhibition of the transcriptional cofactors involved in SMAD transcriptional function, but not owing to suppression of TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced SMAD signaling through mechanisms such as affecting the formation of SMAD heteromers or their DNA binding activities; similarly, LMP\u20101 suppresses ATF3, a transcriptional repressor induced by SMAD signaling, whose association with SMADs blocks the expression of a growth promoting gene, known as Id1. However, in the absence of this factor, SMAD3 binds to Id1 promoter directly, resulting in Id1 upmodulation.67 In this way, it can be seen how the well\u2010documented \u201cdouble\u2010edged sword\u201d nature of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling is manipulated by EBV. While, LMP\u20101 increases the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b2 and SMAD2 phosphorylation but also blocks SMAD\u2010dependent transcription and TGF\u03b2\u2010mediated cytostasis, and exerts its effects by using the non\u2010SMAD arm of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling; it enhances the secretion of fibronectin through the JNK/SAPK pathway,68 which can contribute to tumor invasiveness. EBV also affects the pathway via EBNA\u20101 protein, so that, it decreases SMAD2 levels by enhanced protein turnover.69, 70 Accordingly, EBNA\u20101 represses TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced transcription of \u03b2ig\u2010h3 (a TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010target gene implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis), and PAI\u20101 (a classical target of TGF\u2010\u03b2) in carcinoma cells,70 as well as, PTPRK (a functional tumor suppressor in Hodgkin lymphoma cells) leading to the growth and survival of these cancer cells.69 EBV\u2010encoded BARF1 is another EBV factor by which the virus modulates the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway enhancing cell proliferation in gastric cancer; in an NF\u03baB\u2010dependent manner, BARF1 upmodulate miR\u2010146a\u20105p levels that directly targets SMAD4 and reduces its levels in gastric cancer cells.71 LMP\u20101 also induces miR\u2010146a expression that may similarly suppress SMAD4 protein.72 In summary, reports suggest these EBV proteins as promising target for therapeutic interventions, so that a BARF1\u2010specific mAb was proposed as a novel immunotherapeutic tool toward the management of EBV\u2010associated malignancies.73\n",

Furthermore, suppression of this viral miRNA eliminates this suppression in B cells infected by KSHV.76 Similarly, KSHV miR\u2010K10 variants repress the pathway through targeting TGFbRII, so that its expression is adequate to block TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010mediated cell apoptosis in KSHV\u2010infected PEL cells.74 THBS1 has been suggested as another KSHV\u2010encoded miRNAs target; miR\u2010K12 targets this factors resulting in repression of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling.78 In addition to the latent proteins, 2 KSHV lytic products also interfere with TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling; viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF\u20101) was demonstrated to perturb TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced transcription and growth arrest through direct interaction with both SMAD3 and SMAD4, leading to interrupting the formation of SMAD3\u2010SMAD4 complex and their DNA binding activity.79 Furthermore, by binding to the transcriptional coactivator CBP and blocking its recruitment into transcription initiation complexes on TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010responsive elements, the KSHV lytic protein, K\u2010bZIP, also inhibits TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling.80\n",

Additionally, they reported that HBZ could overcome the Tax\u2010induced inhibition.82 Taken together, these interactions proposed that the modulation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling may play a critical role in the HTLV\u20101\u2010associated leukemogenesis.",

This effect may root from the induction of a known activator of latent TGF\u2010\u03b2, matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP\u20102), by IE1 and IE2.85 Moreover, manipulated TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling by CMV may also be involved in defective placental development, and then in pregnancy\u2010associated complications. In CMV\u2010infected placental blood vessels, the virus infected endothelial cells induced the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b2 (and TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling) and collagen IV through increasing \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin production, proposing that CMV infection of the placenta may modify ECM, enabling the virus to translocate throughout the placenta to infect the fetus.94 Extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT) invasion into the endometrium is a critical event to remodel the uterine arterioles during normal pregnancy, whose dysfunction results in impaired placental blood flow.95 An in vitro study revealed that CMV may inhibit EVT proliferation and invasion by dysregulating the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway; so that, the levels of TGF\u2010\u03b2, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 mRNA were significantly increased, but those of TGF\u03b2RI, TGF\u03b2RII, SMAD7, MMP2, and MMP9 were reported to be decreased by HCMV infection.86\n",
