Though the sponges have simple morphology and anatomy, they show symbiotic association with several microorganisms, which are the main source of secondary metabolites and are capable of producing many biologically active compounds. So there is a good debate going on among the researchers that the source of such biologically active compounds/substances is either the sponge itself or the microorganism residing in the sponges. But unfortunately most of these symbiotic microorganisms are non-culturable. Anyhow the sponges as a whole are the good source of several substances covering the polyketides, alkaloids, terpenes, etc. This chapter deals with the variety of such chemical substances present in the sponges and their biological activities.",

Sponges obtain feed by propelling water through tiny pores in the body wall, thus capturing microorganisms and organic detritus that may be present in their body. Further the sponges inhabit several millions of symbiotic organisms, particularly microorganisms which are producing many biologically active substances for their successful survival in sponges which are also taking part in it. Because of this reason, there is a debate among the researchers about the source of these biological substances. Thus the sponge as a whole contributes to show a variety of biological activities, including antimicrobial, anticancer, and also reported to have toxic materials (Table 9 .1).",

But only very few of them are available as potent drugs in the market which are being superseded by the synthetic ones. This may be because of the non-availability of source materials for the continuous supply of such biologically active compounds. Further this acts as a limiting factor for the pharmaceutical companies to go for patenting. So the pharmaceutical companies prefer the synthetic compounds to get continuous supply after launching their product in the market. However, it is not that much easy to synthesize, economically, some of the natural products, since they have more complex structure. Hence, further research is needed to find out the ways and means to synthesize the more complex marine natural products. Above all, the research in the field of marine natural products needs to be encouraged by the funding agencies to get fruitful results in future which need not be immediate as that of synthetic chemistry outcomes.
