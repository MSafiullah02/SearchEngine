While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (e.g. cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms. Those dying with-but not of-COVID-19 may still be infectious, however. While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations. Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there are a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings. A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations. We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.",

[2] [3] [4] A substantial portion of COVIDinfected individuals are suspected to be asymptomatic carriers; estimates derived from select populations of quarantined individuals who underwent widespread testing (e.g. cruise ship passengers and Japanese citizens evacuated from China) range from 18-33%. [5] [6] Of those known to be COVID-19 positive, approximately 20-30% will develop more severe disease necessitating hospitalization. Such disease may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death. [7] [8] [9] Risk factors for severe disease have been reported to include advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes-although recent data suggests hospitalization may be more common among younger COVID-19 patients than previously suspected. [7] [8] Case fatality ratios range widely from 0.2-7.7% depending on the population age, prevalence of comorbidities, testing criteria and availability, health care capacity, and how cases are defined. 10-13 A variety of electronic databases provide ongoing daily monitoring of COVID-19 cases tabulated by country. 14-16 Inevitably there will be an increased number of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths encountered at autopsy. While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations.

[30] [31] Reportedly droplets do not typically spread beyond 6 feet (2 meters) nor linger in air, although some evidence has suggested a longer range of spread may be possible.

[38] [39] [40] [41] [42] However, the most likely aerosol generating autopsy procedure is use of powered oscillating bone saws, particularly during brain removal. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] High densities of aerosolized particles are generated in the region of the saw placing the user at risk. While N95 respirator masks physically filter 95% of particles at least 1\uf06dm in size from the inspired air, CDC and OSHA guidelines nonetheless suggest avoiding use of an oscillating bone saw at autopsy in cases of suspected/confirmed COVID-19. If a saw is employed, it is recommended that a vacuum shroud be attached to assist in capturing aerosols. 17-18 Other oscillating saw aerosol reduction techniques to consider include moistening the saw blade before cutting, using autopsy tables with built-in ventilation, tenting plastic around the decedent's neck and head to entrap aerosols, and wearing a HEPA-filtered PAPR rather than N95 mask. [46] [47] [48] [49] As in the current presented case, other general splash and aerosol reduction techniques (e.g. eschewing use of vacuum assisted aspirator, sink tissue grinder, or hose) are also advised.

Surface disinfection with diluted household bleach solutions (i.e. of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solutions, or alcohol solutions (i.e. with at least 70% A C C E P T E D ethanol) have been shown to inactivate human coronaviruses within 1 minute. [58] [59] For hospitalgrade disinfectants, staff should verify their suitability for use against SARS-CoV-2 and ensure disinfectants remain on surfaces in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency recommendations. [60] [61] While conclusive data regarding how long infectious human remains may harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 is lacking, autopsies in cases of SARS found that SARS-CoV could be recovered from lung tissue and grown in cell culture up to seven days after death. [62] [63] Considering that there is reportedly 75-80% similarity between the viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (causative agent of SARS), these results suggest that protective precautions are called for even in cases of delayed suspected COVID-19 death investigations or autopsies. 1, 64 While limited data exists regarding formalin inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue, formalin fixation at room temperature has been shown to inactivate most of SARS-CoV (i.e. close to assay detection limits) within a day. [64] [65] Diagnosis In cases of suspected COVID-19 in which full autopsies are performed, submission of SARS-CoV-2 swabs from both upper and bilateral lower respiratory tracts is recommended by the CDC. 17 If nasopharyngeal as well as bilateral tracheobronchial/lung swabs are procured it is recommended they be submitted in separate vials each containing 2-3 ml of viral transport medium. 17 ME/C offices, however, must be cognizant of their current state health department testing capacity and proceed accordingly. 17,19 A rational strategy for minimizing the number of swab submissions per autopsy is to submit swabs only from the lower respiratory tract.",

In the event that swabs were not procured at autopsy, fixed autopsy tissue specimens may also be submitted to CDC in suspected COVID-19 deaths for immunohistochemical, molecular, or other assay characterization. 17 Recent diagnostic advancements include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) enabling US laboratories already certified for high complexity testing to develop and validate their own SARS-CoV-2 testing; this markedly augmented diagnostic capability as previously all testing was performed mainly by US public health laboratories. 66 Additionally, there has been EUA approval of rapid COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests that some manufacturers report can deliver results in less than an hour. 67 Recently, a serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing to assess for COVID-19 antibodies has received FDA approval and more are in development; these are expected to prove of utility in more accurately calculating disease transmission and mortality rates. 67-69",

Performing a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for SARS-CoV-2 requires neither a negative pressure room nor N95 respirator; basic contact and droplet precaution PPE are sufficient. 17 In cases in which autopsy is merited, the above described precautions should be followed to prevent morgue staff-acquired COVID-19 infection. Some offices have elected to perform limited autopsies (e.g. precluding brain/spinal cord removal) in cases of suspected/known COVID-19 positivity to reduce morgue staff aerosol exposure. Others have incorporated antemortem or postmortem CT radiology as a A C C E P T E D means of helping triage decedents meriting testing and/or autopsy. 19,21 Establishing collaborative relations with larger ME/C offices capable of safely autopsying suspected highly infectious disease cases should be encouraged. Globally, mobile biosafety autopsy facilities/laboratories with sophisticated infrastructure have been deployed during disease epidemics such as SARS and Ebola virus; advantages include the ability to mobilize rapidly to areas of need with minimal footprint. [73] [74] [75] Such mobile facilities may be advisable in the US as well.",

Renal changes included arteriolosclerosis, mesangial sclerosis and hypercellularity, and focal global glomerulosclerosis. A section of medulla had no inflammatory tipped swabs of the right and left main bronchi were procured, placed into viral transport medium, and submitted to the Washington State Public Health Laboratory for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza testing. Bacterial swabs of areas of potential consolidation were placed in Amies transport media tubes and submitted to the University of Washington microbiology laboratory for culture. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 returned as positive 11.5 hours after submission. Negative influenza results returned several days later. Bacterial cultures were positive for methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans.
