A cytokine storm is the reason behind acute lung injury, and hyperactivity of the complement system through the alternate pathway has been hypothesized as the possible mechanism. Preliminary reports employing complement inhibitors have shown promise, and randomized trials are under progress to test the efficacy of these drugs [11\u201313].",

During the pandemic, in addition, the orthopaedic surgeon has to endeavour to ensure the protection of the patient, himself/herself, other health care workers and other patients. Optimal use of health care resources becomes vital during the pandemic.All patients/visitor staff visiting the hospital should be screened for fever and any suggestive symptoms.COVID-19 patients have to be treated separately.Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for traumatic cases and those with red flags. Temporary pain-alleviating measures like intra-articular corticosteroids or nerve blocks should be considered.During the lockdown, all elective procedures are withheld. After the period of lockdown some balance may need to be achieved between trying to prevent spread of COVID-19 and provision of continuity of patient care. Surgeries that can be performed with daycare admission could be allowed.The suggested risk stratification for surgery during the pandemic is as under [49]:oElective surgery: Chronic problems where surgery can be delayed without significant difference in eventual outcome or harm to the patient.oUrgent, somewhat elective surgery: As the virus becomes more prevalent, surgeries for injuries such as ACL, meniscal injuries, rotator cuff tears, biceps injuries, intraarticular displaced radial fractures should be still performed, possibly in an outpatient/day care setting to minimize utilization of resources.oUrgent only: As resources assume paramount importance and virus becomes more prevalent, only injuries in which immediate surgical intervention would prevent significant impairment of function such as fracture dislocations, pilon fractures, cauda equina syndrome etc. should be considered.oEmergency only: In this situation, the hospital and ICU would be having critical shortage of resources and only life or limb threatening injuries should be taken to surgery. The goal should be to minimize the need for ventilator support e.g. using spinal anaethesia for surgery, even if it is outside the usual standard of care.All attempts should be made to reduce hospital revisits. Telemedicine is useful not only in this regard but also for first consultation.Other than social distancing amongst the doctors and health care workers, temporal separation is also required to reduce spread of infection.",
