            "text": "From COVID-19, MERS and SARS to H1N1, Zika and Ebola, people around the world have been facing rampant waves of infectious diseases. New pandemics are anticipated to occur at an increasing frequency (Wolfe, 2011). One of the direst consequences of these pandemics is its negative impact on people\u2019 emotional well-being (Lu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Yet the current understanding of how an outbreak influences people's life such as their emotional well-being remains limited. Much prior research has focused on well-being differences across, for example, gender (Wood, Rhodes, and Whelan, 1989), age (Steptoe, Deaton, and Stone, 2015), social connectedness (Myers, 1999) and income levels (Kahneman and Deaton, 2010), as well as individual dispositions (Diener and Seligman, 2002) and consumption patterns (Dunn, Aknin, and Norton, 2008). However, relatively little is known about how increasingly common situations\u2014epidemic outbreaks\u2014impact emotional well-being. Even less is known about the factors that may worsen or protect emotional well-being during an outbreak. Identifying these factors is critically important, as they inform policies and interventions aimed at protecting people's psychological well-being in the age of pandemics.",

We found that the onset of the epidemic in China led to a 74% decline in overall emotional well-being. Individuals who were residing near the epicenter of the outbreak, of an older age, or married experienced a steeper incline in emotional well-being, suggesting that factors associated with, respectively, the likelihood of contracting a disease, extent of potential harm, and extant relational concerns are moderators of well-being deterioration. Perhaps more importantly, we found that, during the coronavirus outbreak, individuals\u2019 perceived level of knowledge about coronavirus infection was a stronger \u201cprotector\u201d of their emotional well-being than the actual amount of knowledge they possessed. We propose that this is because a higher level of perceived knowledge can lead to a stronger sense of control, which in turn protects emotional well-being during an outbreak. This proposition was supported by our analyses of the data, which showed that sense of control was a mediator of the impact of perceived knowledge on emotional well-being (even after controlling for actual knowledge and other demographic and economic variables). The finding thus suggests that factors boosting sense of control can alleviate the detrimental effect of an epidemic outbreak on emotional well-being.",

They indicated the extent to which they had control over the circumstances they were facing (1 = very much lack control, 5 = very much have control) and the extent to which they were confident that they could manage not to be infected by the coronavirus (1 = not confident at all, 5 = very confident). Finally, they completed five multiple-choice questions (adapted from the information officially released by China's CDC) that assessed their actual level of knowledge regarding preventing coronavirus infection. These questions covered effective handwashing, disinfectant usage, mask usage, avoidance of mouth/eye/nose-touching, and prevention of droplet spread.",

This overall index served as the dependent variable in our analyses. We coded whether participants were residing in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Because the monthly household income measures used in the two surveys differed in the number of income brackets offered, we transformed them for use in our analyses. Specifically, due to the ordinal nature of the scale items (e.g., 5,000-7,999 RMB; 8,000-11,999 RMB; \u2026 50,000 RMB or higher), we, following an established approach (11), recoded each response by taking the midpoint (e.g., 6,499 RMB) of the respective income interval when a fixed-range scale item was selected (e.g., 5,000-7,999 RMB). When an open-range item was chosen (e.g., 50,000 RMB or higher), we recoded the response using the lower bound (e.g., 50,000 RMB). We then linearly transformed the value by dividing it by 1,000 so that the monthly household income is measured in units of 1,000 RMB. Furthermore, we averaged the items for perceived knowledge (r = .595) and sense of control (r = .579), respectively, into a single measure. We also counted the number of objective knowledge questions each participant answered correctly, which served as a measure of actual knowledge.",

We ran a series of regressions with emotional well-being as the dependent variable, and the coronavirus outbreak (1 = during, 0 = before), whether the individual resided in Hubei (1 = yes, 0 = no), age, sex (1 = female, 0 = male), marital status (1 = married, 0 = not married), household income, and each of their interaction term with the outbreak as predictors (see Table 1\n). The analyses not only established a consistent, significant negative effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being, but also revealed a set of significant interactions: (i) Individuals residing in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, experienced a larger decline in emotional well-being. Because the overwhelming majority of Chinese coronavirus patients resided in that region (Dong, Du, and Gardner, 2020), this result suggests that a higher perceived likelihood of contracting the virus may accentuate the detrimental effect of an epidemic outbreak on emotional well-being. (ii) Those of an older age also experienced larger a reduction of emotional well-being during the outbreak. Because the coronavirus was known to cause more harm to the elderly than people of a younger age (CDC, 2020), this pattern suggests that the extent to which an individual perceives that s/he might suffer from contracting a disease moderates the effect of an epidemic on the person's emotional well-being. (iii) Individuals who were married also experienced a greater decline in emotional well-being, suggesting that enduring an outbreak may potentially exacerbate relational concerns that worsen emotional well-being. This pattern is consistent with the sudden spike in divorce filings immediately after the outbreak in China (Financial Times, 2020). Neither income or gender had a significant interaction effect with the outbreak.",

Specifically, our results suggest that factors associated with the likelihood of contracting a disease (e.g., living close to the source of an outbreak), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and extant relational concerns (e.g., those within a marriage) may exacerbate the detrimental effect of an epidemic outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals\u2019 perception of their knowledge about an epidemic is another important factor: Regardless of their actual level of knowledge, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, can better shield their emotional well-being from declining during an outbreak. This occurs because a higher perceived level of knowledge can lead to a stronger sense of control, which in turn protects emotional well-being. In other words, approaches that boost sense of control, can attenuate the detrimental effect of an outbreak on happiness. These findings inform future research, and offer insights for policies and interventions aimed at caring for people's psychological well-being during an epidemic.",
