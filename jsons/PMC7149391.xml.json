            "text": "The in vivo fate and role of human milk leukocytes in defense of the infant are not well understood. The area about the upper alimentary and respiratory tracts seems to provide potential sites for human milk leukocytes to enter. It is of considerable interest that small numbers of memory T cells are detected in blood in infancy.132 Thus, it may be possible that maternal memory T cells in milk compensate for the developmental delay in their production in the infant. There is evidence from experimental animal studies that milk lymphocytes enter tissues of the neonate,120 but that has not been demonstrated in humans. There are also reports of transfer of cellular immunity by breast-feeding.133 It will be important to ascertain whether those reports will be verified by testing for cellular immunity against many different antigens in young infants who have or have not been breast-fed.",

The diseases in question are type 1 diabetes mellitus,158 lymphomas,159 acute lymphocytic leukemia,160 and Crohn's disease.161 Although preventing or lessening infections by antimicrobial agents or by anti-inflammatory agents in human milk may have long-term consequences, agents that influence the development of systemic or mucosal defenses of the infant may also be responsible for those possible long-term effects.2.Increased levels of certain immune factors in breast-fed infants cannot be accounted for by passive transfer of those substances from human milk. Breast-feeding primes the recipient to produce higher blood levels of interferon-\u03b1 in response to respiratory syncytial virus infections.162 In addition, increments in blood levels of fibronectin achieved by breast-feeding cannot be accounted for by the amounts of that protein in human milk. Moreover, breast-feeding leads to a more rapid development of systemic163 and secretory163, 164 antibody responses and of secretory IgA in external secretions57, 58, 59 including urine,58, 59 which is far removed from the route of ingestion. Therefore, those increments are not due to absorption of those same factors from human milk.3.The third line of evidence is the discovery that all leukocytes in human milk are activated (see previous section on leukocytes). Investigations revealed that human milk enhances the movement of blood monocytes in vitro. In addition, much of that motility was abrogated by antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).165 Subsequently, TNF-\u03b1 in human milk was detected immunochemically.166\n\n",

Much of the disagreement is probably due to confounding variables including variations in the genetic predisposition to atopic disorders, the sufficiency of breast-feeding, dietary exposures not appreciated by the parents, and exposures to inhalant allergens or irritants that might lead to lung damage. Furthermore, there is evidence that increased exposures to infectious diseases facilitate Th1 responses that lead to the development of cellular immunity, whereas much lower exposures engender Th2 responses that lead to antibody formation and hence to possible IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Thus, the effect of breast-feeding on the risk of atopic diseases may well depend on a multiplicity of factors that are not equally represented in all investigated populations.",

To establish whether a breast-fed infant is reacting to a foreign food antigen in human milk, it is necessary to conduct trials of dietary elimination and oral challenge with the food in question in the mother while she is breast-feeding.223 If those trials suggest that the infant is reacting to a foreign food antigen in human milk, then the problem may be avoided by eliminating the food allergen from the maternal diet. If the food allergen is a basic food such as cow's milk, the woman must have a diet that supplies the correct types and quantities of nutrients to meet the needs of lactation.20 If long-term elimination is impractical, then breast-feeding may be stopped and the infant tried on a hypoallergenic formula. In addition, the development of allergic disease in breast-fed infants may be due to alterations in the types of fatty acids found in milks produced by mothers of the allergic infants.224, 225\n",
