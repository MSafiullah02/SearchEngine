Randomized trials have shown that circumcised men are 50\u201361% less likely to acquire HIV infection than men who are uncircumcised [1\u20133]. MC also reduces the chances that women will contract HIV infection because of the lower probability that their partners are infected [4]. As a onetime intervention, MC does not require consistent adherence to preventive behaviors such as condom use or pill taking. As a result, the World Health Organization recommends that countries include MC as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy [5]. Additional health benefits to men from MC include reduced risk of acquiring genital ulcer disease [6], herpes simplex virus and human papilloma virus [7]. which is an important risk factor for penile cancer [8]. MC also benefits female partners of the circumcised men by lowering the risk of women acquiring human papilloma virus, which causes cervical cancer, genital ulcer disease, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis [9].",

It has a well-developed health care system, which is widely accessible for its citizens, and almost all births occur in hospitals [16]. Thailand has some experience with circumcision as Muslim boys are circumcised in a pre-adolescent religious ritual. In addition, for-profit hospitals that cater to a foreign and wealthy clientele provide NMC [17]. However, the majority (~ 90%) Buddhist population does not practice either MC or child circumcision. So, one would presume that the general population is not familiar with the benefits or complications of NMC.",

Increasing teaching about the solid evidence on this issue is warranted in both medical schools, nursing schools and in-service trainings. This education should make the case that NMC is preferable to MC performed at a later age because recovery is faster, there are fewer complications, and the importance of circumcising before exposure to HIV, HPV, etc. This suggests that medical staff in obstetrics and in pediatrics should also be the primary focus of educational campaigns.

The participants also thought that NMC is difficult to perform and required a specialist physician, anesthesia, special equipment, etc. In places where NMC is widely practiced it is frequently performed by non-surgeons without general anesthesia and requires simple, disposable equipment. There also was concern about the post-operative care of the infant although in countries where NMC is routine practice, simple instructions are given to mothers and most of the care is done at home after discharge. Medical staff need to see that the procedure is simple and can be carried out by general practitioners and that there are devices that accomplish circumcision safely with minimal bleeding or need for follow-up. Nurses should be a particular target of these information efforts since they will likely be the interface with the family. Medical students and physicians will need training in how to perform the procedure and nurses will require training in post-operative care of the infants and in teaching mothers how to provide home care.",

Evidence from Africa is that mothers, once informed of the benefits, often support MC. This means that health professionals need to be educated about both the advantages of NMC and how to counsel parents who are contemplating whether their infant son should have the procedure since educating the public will only be effective if medical staff are also supportive of NMC. The health education program will help people have a better understanding of NMC, have more confidence in its safety and effectiveness, and gain the cooperation of parents and the public. This health education campaign should occur at the same time as when hospitals begin to offer NMC. The campaign will have to be conducted over a number of years until NMC becomes commonplace.
