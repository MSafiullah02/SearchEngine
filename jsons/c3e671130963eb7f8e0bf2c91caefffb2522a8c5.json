Moreover, the AUC of NLR for predicting severe patients is less than 0.9, 1 indicating poor predictive performance. Another study showed that N8R (neutrophils 2 to CD8 + T-cell ratio) has better performance with a higher AUC value than NLR in 3 the ROC curve analysis, and may serve as a more powerful factor than NLR for 4 predicting the severity in COVID-19 patients [19] . However, neutrophils are 5 susceptible to many factors, and its ratio to CD8 + T cells will mask the actual 6 reduction of T cells. Therefore, we believe that using direct counting of T cells may 7 more accurately reflect the patient's immune status and thus have better predictive 8 performance. T cells increase reactively [21] .

CRP is an acute-phase protein that is an extremely sensitive but 2 non-specific biomarker in many kinds of systemic inflammatory processes, including 3 bacterial and viral infections[23]. PCT has been proposed to be a reliable marker for 4 distinguishing bacterial infections from other types of infections[24]. IL6 is always 5 used for monitoring early states of infectious because of its fast serum peak[25]. In 6 patients with COVID-19, about half of the patients had elevated concentrations of 7 CRP (>10 mg/L)[26, 27]. Levels of IL6 showed sustained increases in severe patients 8 compared to the mild patients[19]. In this study, we found that levels of CRP and IL6 9 were significantly higher in the moderate and severe patients than in mild patients on 1 0 admission. With the recovery of COVID-19 patients, the elevated CRP and IL6 1 1 gradually decreased to normal levels. However, there was no difference in CRP, PCT, 1 2 and IL6 levels between moderate and severe patients. ROC curve analysis also 1 3 indicated that all of these indicators could not predict the severity of the disease. In 1 4 SARS patients, the IL6 concentration was increased and positively correlated with the 1 5 severity of the disease[28]. Although we found that IL6 does not predict the severity 1 6 of COVID-19 patients, it does not mean that testing for IL6 is useless. It is well 1 7 known that IL6 plays a key role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in chimeric 1 8 antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy of leukemia, as CRS patients can be found to 1 9 have high levels of IL-6[29].
