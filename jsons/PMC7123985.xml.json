            "text": "The last 25 years have witnessed a dramatic shift in the terrain of world health. Usually characterized as a transition from \u201cinternational\u201d to \u201cglobal\u201d health, this shift has been accompanied by epidemiological, organizational, geopolitical and financial transformations. Even though global health has emerged as the dominant term for attempts to address matters of health and disease on a transnational scale, how it differs from earlier designations such as international health or tropical medicine remains underspecified (Anderson 2014; Banta 2001; Brown et al. 2006; Fried et al. 2010; Kleinman 2010; Koplan et al. 2009; Lakoff 2010; McGoey et al. 2011). Scholars have observed a number of features that have accompanied the rise of global health: the declining role of the World Health Organization (WHO) dating from the budget freezes of the 1980s, the relative ascendance of the World Bank in world health affairs, the proliferation of public private partnerships, Bill Gates-style philanthrocapitalism, and an emphasis on health threats that transcend national boundaries, i.e. HIV/AIDs, SARS, pandemic influenza and, more recently, the ebola virus (Brown et al. 2006; Chorev 2012; Kenny 2015; Lakoff and Collier 2008; McCarthy 2002; McCoy et al. 2009; Ruger 2005; Thomas and Weber 2004). In this paper I identify a less frequently observed feature: the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as a global health concern. NCDs, also known as \u201cchronic\u201d or \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, include conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes and share four common risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption and unhealthy diet. I argue that the current concern with NCDs, and the transition from international to global health more generally, coincides with the historical rise of economic rationalities in the field of world health over the last 25 years.",

The contrast between these two moments illustrates the central question of this chapter: How did the dominant conceptualization of health shift from a legitimate end in itself to something that should be maximized in service to the economy?",

I then focus on the World Bank\u2019s increasing involvement in world health affairs beginning in the late 1980s and culminating in the publication of the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health. In addition to its widely criticized recommendations for health sector financing (emphasizing privatization of health care services), the Investing in Health report also introduced a new way of conceptualizing health using the disability adjusted life year (DALY) metric. One DALY is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost to either premature death or to disability. It represents an internationally standardized quantum of ill health used to measure the global incidence of health and disease and to perform cost-effective analyses on potential health care interventions. The shift from disease-specific mortality statistics to DALY calculations brought the global burden of NCDs into clear focus. However, the DALY method by which NCDs became a global health priority relies on a particular economic valuing of human life.1 I situate the creation of the DALY metric with respect to the broader field of health economics, which itself emerged through the 1970s and 1980s. I argue that the DALY metric explains the rise of NCDs on the global health agenda and, more fundamentally, illustrates the rise economic rationalities in the field of global health over the last 25 years.",

            "text": "In September 2011, the United Nations General Assembly convened a high-level meeting to address the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). It was only the second time in history that such a meeting had been devoted to a topic related to health, the first having been in response to the HIV/AIDs pandemic a decade earlier. Unlike the earlier meeting, at which the vast majority of the burden of HIV/AIDs was acknowledged to fall on the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, the 2011 summit presented the threat posed by NCDs as universal (United Nations General Assembly 2001). Far from the diseases of affluence that cancers, diabetes, and hypertension were once portrayed to be, NCDs had by late 2011 come to occupy a central place on the global health agenda. The precise kind of threat that NCDs were seen to present was not limited to the domain of health: the UN Resolution adopted by the General Assembly declared that \u201cthe global burden and threat of non-communicable diseases constitutes one of the major challenges for development in the twenty-first century\u201d and that \u201cnon-communicable diseases are a threat to the economies of many Member States\u201d (United Nations General Assembly 2012). A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) published to coincide with the UN NCD summit similarly warned that \u201cThe economic consequences of NCDs are staggering\u201d with projected losses to low and middle income countries surpassing 4% of their annual output (\u201cFrom Burden to \u2018Best Buys:\u2019 Reducing the Economic Impact of Non-Communicable Diseases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\u201d 2011, 3). Another report projected that the cost of NCDs to the global economy would exceed US$30 trillion over the next 20 years (Bloom et al. 2011, 5). By contrast, the cost of implementing a range of \u201cbest buy\u201d interventions to prevent NCDs was low. The report continued: \u201c[\u2026] the return on this investment will be many millions of avoided premature deaths [\u2026and] many billions of dollars of additional output\u201d (2011, 3). NCDs are here positioned by the UN, by the WHO and by the WEF as a threat to both the health of the population and as a threat to the economy. Conversely, strategies to combat NCDs are imaged as a solid investment in health and in economic growth with an expected yield of positive future returns.",

Although the conference at Alma-Ata represented a high point in the history of the WHO, it also marked the beginning of a long, slow decline in the organization\u2019s prominence. After Alma-Ata, the goal of \u201chealth for all\u201d came to be seen by influential parties such as the United States Government, UNICEF and the Rockerfeller Foundation as overly ambitious and unrealistic (Birn et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2006; Cueto 2004). Without disavowing the goal of health for all, they began to advocate a different means by which to accomplish it. As opposed to what was now termed \u201cComprehensive Primary Health Care\u201d (CPHP), these actors articulated a vision of \u201cSelective Primary Health Care\u201d (SPHC) emphasizing specific, low cost technical interventions that were limited in scope and easy to monitor and evaluate (Balabanova et al. 2013; Walsh and Warren 1979). Specifically, SPHC advocated a four-pronged approach to reducing child mortality known by the acronym GOBI: Growth monitoring (to ensure early detecting of childhood malnutrition), Oral Rehydration Solutions (for diarrheal diseases), Breastfeeding (for improved infant survival and natural family planning) and Immunization against certain communicable diseases. While successful in improving child survival the SPHC approach drew criticism from advocates of a broader-based comprehensive primary health care approach. The growing tension between advocates of SPHC and CPHC caused considerable tension at the WHO.",

Although the Bank\u2019s initial interest in health extended only to population control, by the early 1980s the newly founded Population, Health and Nutrition Department began lending for stand-alone alone health programs on the rationale that enhanced health and nutrition would lead to increased economic growth (World Bank 1980). However, with World Bank money came their associated structural adjustment policies, which, in the domain of health focused on more efficient use of available resources and an increased role for the private sector in financing health services \u2013 all in service of promoting health for economic growth. While this approach drew much criticism from those who opposed privatization of the health sector, it did not stem the influence of the Bank and by 1990 World Bank lending for health surpassed the entire WHO budget (Brown et al. 2006). From the late 1980s to the late 1990s, Bank lending for health, nutrition and population projects grew sevenfold \u2013 with a growing proportion of these loans made with the explicit intention of reforming the structure of health systems (Fair 2008).2\n",

While the health transition held general implications for the orientation of the world health agenda \u2013 away from population control and towards diseases of old-age, for example \u2013 the precise consequences of the transition for the global incidence of disease and for the exact interventions necessary to curb its spread were unknown. This knowledge deficit presented a two-fold problem for the Bank. First, while the Bank was interested in helping to reform health systems to provide a package of \u201cessential health services\u201d it was unclear to which diseases these services should be targeted. Second, in the absence of systematic estimates of the global burden of disease, statistics on disease prevalence were frequently provided by disease-specific advocates. These numbers were viewed with deep suspicion by World Bank health experts (Jamison et al. 1993; Murray and Lopez 1996; World Bank 1993). The Bank thus undertook a wide-reaching Health Sector Priorities Review which yielded a constellation of studies \u2013 most significantly the Disease Control Priorities Project (DCPP) (Jamison et al. 1993) and the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) (Murray and Lopez 1996). Results from both of these projects served as background to the landmark World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health (World Bank 1993), the publication of which is frequently cited as a watershed moment in the transition from international to global health. Importantly for my purposes, the World Development Report 1993 (WDR 1993) also introduced the Disability Adjusted Life Year metric.",

However, even if life was held to have the same intrinsic value at every age, one might still \u201cattach greater importance to years of productive adult life\u201d because of the importance of adults as \u201cnet producers\u201d i.e. for their increased human capital and resulting contribution to economic growth (Murray and Lopez 1996). As a result of age weighting, the relative value of life rises steeply from zero at birth to its peak at age 25 before falling gradually with advancing age. The precise values used for DALY calculations were chosen so that the total number of DALYs is the same as though uniform age weights had been used (World Bank 1993, 213). But age weighting redistributes DALYs away from the early and later years and concentrate them on the middle, economically productive years of life \u2013 i.e. those years most critical to the Bank\u2019s priority of economic growth.",

However, the inclusion of this purportedly \u201ctypical\u201d social value also has considerable consequences for the distribution of DALYs. Like age weighting, discounting results in the relatively greater valuing of economically productive middle years of life because the future years of life lost from childhood deaths is discounted over a longer period. The contribution of childhood deaths to the global burden of disease is thus given relatively less numerical significance. As the GBD authors acknowledge \u201c[\u2026] higher discount rates reduce the importance of premature deaths at young ages in relation to those at older ages\u201d (WDR 214).",

Before the introduction of the DALY metric, the then-current most comprehensive study of adult health worldwide concluded that \u201cmortality from non-communicable diseases declines as overall mortality declines\u201d (Feachem et al. 1992, 94). This suggested that as countries\u2019 death rates declined as they entered \u201chealth transition\u201d so too would NCDs. However, after the introduction of the DALY metric just a few years later, the GBD would report that NCDs represented the single largest category of DALYs lost worldwide \u2013 greater than either communicable diseases or injuries (Murray and Lopez 1996). Furthermore, it would predict that by 2020 NCDs would account for more than 70% of deaths in developing regions (Murray and Lopez 1996). At the same time, the Disease Control Priorities Project (DCPP), also sponsored by the World Bank, would make a strong case for cost effectiveness of health interventions designed to mitigate NCD risks \u2013 notably those directed towards personal behavior change (Jamison et al. 1993).",

However, as this paper has suggested, the DALY logic by which NCDs became a global health priority depends on a vision of health as a form of human capital and as a site of investment. This can be seen in some of the more technical dimensions of the DALY metric, age weighting and discounting, for example. The political implications of the DALY metric \u2013 the redistribution of DALYs away from childhood disease and diseases of old age and towards the middle, economically productive years of life \u2013 are frequently obscured by the apparent objectivity of the numbers produced by DALY calculations. Yet these implications remain inseparable from the rising prominence of the World Bank in world health affairs since the late 1980s, its efforts to restructure health systems according to cost effectiveness, and its greater valuing of the economically productive middle years of life so as to prioritize health for economic growth.",

The causes and consequences of this shift have only recently begun to receive sustained scholarly attention (Anderson 2014; Lakoff 2010; McGoey et al. 2011; Wahlberg and Rose 2015). But in this paper, I have suggested that this transition may productively be understood in relationship to the rise of economic rationalities in the field of world health. In contrast to a post-war vision of health as a human right and social good \u2013 a vision that came to be enshrined in the Alta Ata declaration of 1978 \u2013 the contemporary era of global health conceptualizes health as a form of human capital and as a site of investment. The transition from \u201chealth for all\u201d to \u201chealth as investment,\u201d then, can be understood in relation to the economization of world health at the dawn of the twenty first century.",
