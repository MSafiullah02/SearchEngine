Protective processes such as desquamation of skin epithelium, ciliary movement, peristalsis, and production of tears, saliva, and respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tract mucus work in conjunction with these barriers to trap and remove harmful organisms. Substances such as fatty acids found in sweat; lysozyme and phospholipase in tears, saliva, and nasal secretions; defensins and surfactant in the pulmonary tract; and defensins in the GI tract inhibit the growth of organisms, primarily bacteria. The acidic nature of sweat and GI secretions also helps prevent organism growth. In addition to the barriers themselves, the normal flora of these sites can prevent the colonization of pathogenic organisms by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces.",

Primary or metastatic skin tumors increase the risk for skin and soft tissue infections and for bacteremia with organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Corynebacterium spp. Tumors of the oral cavity and nasopharynx damage the mucosa, resulting in local infection in the mouth, nose, throat, or sinuses and predisposing to infections with streptococci, Haemophilus influenza, and anaerobic necrotizing infections. Occasionally, these infections can spread to the meninges causing meningitis or locally invade the sinuses, resulting in osteomyelitis with or without subsequent cerebral abscess. Tumors of the GI tract can invade the mucosa, causing local abscess formation, bacteremia, or perforation and resulting peritonitis. In these infections, gram-negative bacteria predominate; however, fungal infections are also encountered, primarily in patients who have received broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Gynecological malignancies disrupt barriers in the female genitourinary (GU) tract predisposing to infection with enterococci, enteric aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and Clostridium spp. Anatomical barriers are further compromised by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines, bleomycin, cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil, those most likely to cause skin breakdown, stomatitis, and GI mucositis. Dermatologic side effects are also increasingly reported in patients who receive thalidomide [23]. Radiation combined with chemotherapy further increases the risk of skin and mucosal toxicity.",

            "text": "Deficits in the humoral components of the innate immune system also predispose to infection [24\u201329]. Some important components include the complement and coagulation systems and substances such as lactoferrin, transferrin, lysozyme, interleukin-1, and interferons. Complement deficiencies predispose to infection through ineffective opsonization and through defects in lytic activity resulting from altered assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), components C5b through C9. These deficiencies predispose to infections with the encapsulated bacteria, Streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis; mycobacteria; fungi such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and viruses. The role of complement in defense against viral infection is sufficiently important that pathogenic viruses such as Herpesviridae and Coronaviridae have had to develop strategies to evade complement activation. Alterations in coagulation can compromise vascular permeability and diminish chemotaxis of phagocytic cells. Additionally, deficiencies in the production of beta-lysin, a platelet-derived protein that acts as a cationic detergent, can diminish response to gram-positive bacteria. Lactoferrin and transferrin bind iron, an essential nutrient for bacteria; lysozyme helps break down the bacterial cell wall; and interleukin-1 induces fever and the production of acute-phase proteins involved in opsonization. Deficiencies in these components increase the risk of bacterial infections. Deficiencies in interferon predispose to viral infections because it is vital to limiting viral replication within cells.",

They are leukocytes found in most tissues of the body, particularly in locations in close contact with the external environment, thus functioning as early immune sentinel cells at sites of pathogen entry. They contribute to host defense directly through phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, and indirectly through release of histamine and other vasoactive mediators that increase vascular permeability and blood flow, and through their action on smooth muscle to help increase expulsion of mucosal parasites and to enhance mucus production to aid in pathogen immobilization and cytoprotection. Mast cells also produce chemotactic factors that can recruit inflammatory cells including eosinophils, natural killer cells, and neutrophils to sites of infection. Their role in protection against parasites including helminthes, nematodes, and protozoa is well known. More recently, their role in protection against bacterial infections, especially gram-negative infections, has been established. While there is some evidence that mast cells help mediate antiviral and antifungal immunity, this evidence is more limited. Cancer patients receiving corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents that decrease mast cell activity may have compromised ability to respond in a timely manner to parasitic and bacterial infections.",

While they were originally recognized as playing a major role in the destruction of malignant and virally infected cells, it is now evident that NK cells play an important role in the effective control of a diverse array of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. While many of these infections can be contained in the absence of NK cells, clearance of these organisms is almost always more efficient and complete in the presence of a functional NK cell response.",

Neutropenia, commonly defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) lower than 1,000 or 500 cells/mm3, primarily occurs in patients with acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and those who have received intensive myelosuppressive therapies for their underlying malignancies or as part of their hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [22, 38\u201340]. Patients with aplastic anemia are also likely to present with severe and persistent neutropenia, although unlike neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies, they may remain infection free for prolonged periods [41]. Although less common, solid organ tumors, such as metastatic carcinoma of the breast, prostate, lung, adrenal, thyroid, and kidney, can all infiltrate the bone marrow and result in neutropenia [22].",

Although mortality risk reached statistical significance only for patients with endometrial, breast, and colorectal cancers, diabetes appeared to pose some additional mortality risk for all cancer types studied. In another systematic review and meta-analysis, Barone et al. found that cancer patients with diabetes were approximately 50 % more likely to die following surgery than their non-diabetic counterparts [76].

Questions should include exposures at home, work and in healthcare settings, habits, and hobbies. Also, a thorough travel history may provide clues for an otherwise improbable diagnosis. Organisms of concern include Mycobacterium tuberculosis; viruses such as HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, VZV, and hepatitis B; fungi such as Aspergillus spp., histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii; and parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, S. stercoralis, and Trypanosoma cruzii [14, 82]. Physicians caring for these patients should familiarize themselves with the guidelines for monitoring and, in some cases, providing prophylaxis for these pathogens. Clostridium difficile disease is common in cancer patients and can recur or relapse, primarily due to ongoing receipt of antimicrobial agents; however, some chemotherapeutic agents have also been associated with C. difficile disease including methotrexate, paclitaxel, and carboplatin [83\u201389]. Likewise, previous infection and/or colonization with drug-resistant bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacteria, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-containing gram-negative bacteria (ESBLs), and, increasingly, carbapenem-resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae is a risk factor for subsequent infection with these organisms. Clinicians should be aware of past infection and colonization status with drug-resistant pathogens to help facilitate empiric antimicrobial choices when infections arise [14, 82].",

Immunonutrition consisting of an enteral diet supplemented with arginine, dietary nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids was given to study subjects for five days prior to bowel surgery, and SSI outcomes were compared to a control group. Patients receiving the immunonutrition experienced fewer SSIs than the control group [95]. Similarly, reduced infection rates were reported in a systematic review of immunonutrition in critically ill patients, including those with malignancy [93]. In addition to these studies, other investigators have reported that malnutrition impairs scar formation and increases the risk for surgical complications such as suture dehiscence and infections [96]. Because poor nutritional status is so prevalent and portends worse outcomes, early detection of risks for malnutrition and ongoing nutritional assessments should be a standard part of the quality of care in oncology practices [97].",

Recently, rapid advances in immunology have provided experimental evidence that acute and chronic stress can alter the immune response to viral challenges, vaccine response, and wound healing [98, 99]. One recent systematic review supports the concept that stress, anxiety, and depression are risk factors for acute viral respiratory tract disease acquisition and progression [100]. Stress activates the major neural pathways of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system. The mediators they release can, in turn, induce pronounced changes in components of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, including cytokines, macrophages, natural killer cells, and T lymphocytes [101, 102]. Although individual response to stress varies, chronic high-level stress, as experienced by many cancer patients, is thought to be detrimental. Much remains to be learned regarding the complex interplay between physical health and psychological health in these patients [103].",

In one review of 438 leukemic patients, the incidence of major gastrointestinal complications, including typhlitis, was 13 % [114]. Another study estimated the incidence of typhlitis to be at least 5 % in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid malignant tumors, with mortality rates ranging from 30 to 50 % [115]. The surgical management of patients with typhlitis is a frequently encountered although controversial issue. Along with the increased risk of infection, these neutropenic and usually thrombocytopenic patients have a high risk of operative mortality from the surgery itself. Consequently, the care of these patients should be individualized. Non-operative management with bowel rest, decompression, nutritional support, and broad-spectrum antibiotics is often successful and is usually recommended initially. Operative intervention is typically reserved for patients with bowel perforation and uncontrollable hemorrhage, or for those whose clinical condition deteriorates despite conservative management [115, 116].",

Other agents such as bleomycin and methotrexate are associated with skin lesions that can predispose to bacteremia with staphylococci and other skin flora. Agents such as BCNU, Ara-C, and daunorubicin irritate veins, increasing the risk of phlebitis and subsequent bacteremia. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause bone marrow suppression and neutropenia in a dose-related fashion. Some of these drugs can also inhibit neutrophilic migration and chemotaxis. Regimens that include corticosteroids inhibit the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. Humoral immunity is altered by agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and 6-mercaptopurine.

The immunotherapeutic actions of BRMs can be passive or active. The effects of monoclonal antibodies are passive in that they are targeted to antigens or receptor sites on cancer cell surfaces. When the antibody binds to the target, a cascade of events leads to tumor cell death, usually without invoking an immune response. Conversely, other BRMs work by actively evoking either a non-specific immune response to cancer cells as with interferons and interleukins or a specific immune response as with cancer vaccines [126\u2013130].",

One study demonstrated that cancer patients with HIV receiving rituximab in addition to their chemotherapy had a 12 % increase in infection-related deaths and an increased rate of opportunistic infections [132]. Another study demonstrated that patients with lymphoma receiving rituximab maintenance therapy had higher rates of infection and neutropenia [133]. Because interleukin-2 induces a reversible but profound defect in neutrophilic chemotaxis, high doses used in the treatment for renal cell carcinoma and melanoma have been associated with infection rates between 13 and 38 %.

The use of antimicrobial agents can radically alter host flora, predisposing to infection. To understand the changing microbial flora, it is important to understand a concept known as colonization resistance. Individuals are colonized with non-invasive flora that, in a sense, can be considered \u201cprotective.\u201d This normal flora prevents colonization and subsequent infection with more invasive, pathogenic bacteria. Patients who have lost their normal flora, such as those receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, are at greater risk of colonization and infection with these more invasive organisms. In an animal model of infection, van der Waaij elegantly depicts this phenomenon. In this study, three groups of mice were used: One group was rendered completely germ free, a second group retained their anaerobic flora but were rendered free of aerobes, and the third group of normal mice served as the control. The mice were given different oral doses of streptomycin-resistant E. coli for ease of detection, and persistent colonization was determined by the evaluation of fecal flora. The control group required l07\nE. coli to become persistently colonized, the mice with only anaerobic flora required approximately l05\nE. coli, and the germ-free mice, who had no colonization resistance, required only 101 to l02\nE. coli [135].",

Throat cultures from the normal volunteers and the psychiatric patients revealed normal flora. However, the throat cultures from 16 % of the orthopedic patients, 57 % of the medical patients without antibiotics, and 80 % of the medical patients with antibiotics revealed gram-negative bacilli [136].

Loss of gastric acidity and passage and survival of oral flora such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci into the bowel may account in part for its pathogenesis in cancer patients. Another common example is C. difficile colonization and infection induced by antibiotic therapy [83, 137]. In general, however, broad-spectrum antibiotics are more apt to suppress normal, non-invasive flora, particularly anaerobes, and to cause a shift toward gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Increasing data demonstrate that interactions between hosts and the microflora are markedly dynamic, and these interactions are an area of intense research interest [12, 138\u2013142].",

Historically, trials of non-absorbable antibiotics were used to decrease colonization of the alimentary canal. These trials were halted in part due to the emergence of resistant organisms. In one study, surveillance cultures were monitored in 10 patients receiving ampicillin for 3 weeks. Nine of these patients became rapidly colonized with ampicillin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, and several isolates were multiply drug resistant, while only one patient in the control group acquired a multidrug-resistant organism [145]. The total amount of ceftazidime, the duration of therapy, and the number of days of therapy with this agent have all been implicated in the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium bacteremia. Fluoroquinolone use in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with an increase in infections with resistant staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes, as well as increased fluoroquinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli. Likewise, incidence of antimicrobial-resistant fungal infections is related to prophylaxis and treatment. Fluconazole prophylaxis has resulted in the development of resistant strains of C. albicans and non-albicans Candida spp. [146\u2013149] and to outbreaks of inherently fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei [150, 151].",

Each year in the United States, more than five million central venous catheters are inserted, resulting in up to 80,000 catheter-related bloodstream infections and up to 28,000 deaths [152\u2013154]. The risk of infection varies with the device used, duration of placement, and extent of the patient\u2019s immunosuppression. In general, the risk of infection is the greatest for non-tunneled catheters, followed by peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), tunneled catheters, and implanted ports. Multilumen catheters may increase the risk of infection [155]. Catheters placed in the femoral vein are associated with greater risk than those placed in the subclavian or internal jugular veins [156]. To decrease the infection risk, the catheters should be inserted by well-trained providers who adhere to a clinical care bundle that outlines steps for proper catheter insertion and maintenance and removal of the catheter as soon as it is no longer needed [156, 157].",

            "text": "It is often especially difficult to determine whether a bloodstream infection is related to the venous access device because frequently, no evidence of local catheter inflammation is seen. Recently, however, the concept of differential time to positivity has been used to distinguish venous-access-device-related infections from other types of infection, as follows: If the times at which blood cultures become positive (by machine detection in the clinical microbiology laboratory) are more than 2 h apart for simultaneously obtained catheter and peripheral vein blood cultures, the catheter is then strongly implicated as the source of the infection. Although this differential may help determine whether a catheter can be retained or must be removed, most indwelling catheter-related infections will respond to antimicrobial therapy alone, without catheter removal; however, some authors suggest that catheter salvage should be attempted cautiously for neutropenic cancer patients with gram-negative bacteremia [160, 161]. Certain exceptions are notable: Catheter removal is advisable for patients with bloodstream infections caused by fungi and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. For other bacteria, the decision concerning the need for catheter removal will depend on the severity of the clinical picture, the degree of immunosuppression, and the availability of an alternative vascular access site in a given patient. S. aureus may cause endocarditis, and the value of transesophageal echocardiography in the setting of any S. aureus bloodstream infections has been well demonstrated to determine the duration of therapy. In general, if blood cultures remain positive despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy for more than 48 h, or if the patient is clinically unstable, the catheter should be removed independent of etiology [154, 161].",

If pneumonia develops, it is usually due to these same bacterial pathogens with which the patient is colonized. Indeed, the majority of patients are infected with the organisms with which they are colonized; however, 50 % of these organisms are acquired after hospitalization [162]. Studies have demonstrated that serial axillary surveillance cultures grow primarily S. epidermidis and Corynebacterium spp. on admission.

These infections are characterized by acute febrile episodes, which can progress to overwhelming sepsis if not treated promptly [179\u2013184]. However, beginning in the 1980s, investigators noted a relative decrease in the number of gram-negative bacteremia and a significant increase in infections caused by gram-positive aerobic bacteria, namely staphylococci and streptococci. These observations persist in more recent studies, with gram-positive pathogens causing approximately 50 % of microbiologically documented infections, and up to 75 % if only bloodstream infections are considered. Gram-negative organisms now account for 20\u201325 % of infections, and another 20\u201325 % are polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobic bacterial infections occur very infrequently.

            "text": "Several reasons for the increase in gram-positive infections have been postulated [125]. The use of both prophylactic and empiric antibiotic regimens targeting gram-negative bacteria diminishes recovery of gram-negative pathogens while selecting for gram-positive infections [185, 186]. One example is the emergence of streptococcal infections in populations of patients receiving fluoroquinolones [187]. The use of intravascular catheters also increases the likelihood of infection with gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci, that colonize the skin [186]. Chemotherapeutic regimens that cause oral mucositis predispose to infection with bacteria that ordinarily colonize the oropharynx, namely alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Although the mortality associated with gram-positive infections is less than that of gram-negative infections, the morbidity is significant. For example, alpha-hemolytic streptococci have been associated with cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients receiving cytarabine [187]. Furthermore, patients who remain neutropenic for prolonged periods of time are more likely to develop infections with drug-resistant bacteria such as Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium jeikeium, Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas cepacia, and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. These emerge as a consequence of protracted courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics [188, 189].",

These mature-appearing B lymphocytes are found in the peripheral blood. They also infiltrate the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. Much of the gamma globulin produced by patients with CLL is non-functional, leading to defects in humoral immunity [211, 212]. The hypogammaglobulinemia may be profound in these patients, worsens as the disease progresses, and does not revert after chemotherapy, increasing the risk for infections with the encapsulated bacteria S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis and with E. coli [213]. Additionally, defects in cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, and neutrophil and other phagocytic cell defects exist either due to the disease or as a result of the therapies. Treatment modalities such as alkylating agents with or without corticosteroids predispose to streptococcal, staphylococcal, and enteric gram-negative bacterial infections. In these patients, the infections often occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and recurrent infections are common. Treatments with purine analogs or the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab predispose to opportunistic infections with Listeria spp., M. tuberculosis, Nocardia spp., Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jiroveci, and herpesviruses [211, 212, 214]. More recently, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus has been described in CLL patients treated with the purine analog fludarabine and with various monoclonal antibodies [215].",

MM patients are hypogammaglobulinemic, producing normal immunoglobulins at only 10 % the normal rate. Therefore, they are predisposed to infections with the encapsulated bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis [25, 27, 216\u2013218]. As disease progresses, the malignant plasma cells proliferate within the bone marrow to such an extent that the marrow is unable to produce adequate numbers of neutrophils. Therefore, patients with advanced disease may become neutropenic, increasing their risk of gram-negative bacterial infections [216, 219]. In recent years, however, the advent of new treatment modalities, such as HSCT and the novel antimyeloma agents, bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide, has improved outcomes for multiple myeloma patients and transformed it into a chronic disease. The resulting cumulative immunosuppression has increased the risk of infection and expanded the spectrum of potential pathogens in this patient population to include infections such as C. difficile, CMV, and opportunistic molds [220].",

Both colonization and infection among immunocompromised patients are increasing, especially in those receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly carbapenems. S. maltophilia causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, and wound infections in debilitated patients and is notoriously multidrug resistant, making treatment difficult [232]. In a recent retrospective review of S. maltophilia infections in HSCT recipients over four years in Israel, 19 of 570 (3 %) had S. maltophilia infections. The majority of patients had undergone allogeneic HSCT, had received a carbapenem during the previous month, and had a central venous catheter infection. All isolates remained susceptible to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole [233]. Burkholderia cenocepacia is a gram-negative pathogen, primarily associated with infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. It has recently been reported to cause an outbreak in cancer patients related to central venous catheters and to cause a vaginal infection in a patient with multiple myeloma [234, 235]. Achromobacter spp. and Alcaligenes spp. are gram-negative bacteria that are increasingly associated with infections in cancer patients. A review of consecutive bacteremia from 1989 to 2003 at MD Anderson Cancer Center revealed that 67 % of patients had underlying hematological malignancies and 52 % experienced neutropenia. Achromobacter xylosoxidans was the most common pathogen (94 %), followed by Achromobacter denitrificans (4 %) and Alcaligenes faecalis (2 %). The majority of patients had infected intravascular catheters, followed by pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Of the infections, 52 % were polymicrobial and 7 % had concurrent fungemia. Most isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, antipseudomonal penicillin, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. Attributable mortality in this series was 15 % [236].",

First, appearance of a hypervirulent strain of C. difficile in recent years has been associated with rising rates of severe and recurrent infection, and increased morbidity and mortality. Some studies have demonstrated chemotherapeutic agents as an independent risk factor for C. difficile infection (CDI) and disease severity [83\u201386]; however, this was recently disputed in a study by Stewart and colleagues in which they found that patients with CDI with underlying hematological malignancies had longer lengths of hospital stay but no difference in rates of colectomy, ICU admission, or death [89]. A second emerging syndrome, E. coli pyomyositis has been increasingly described among patients with hematological malignancies [237\u2013239]. Pyomyositis is typically caused by gram-positive bacteria, primarily S. aureus; however, review of cases from 2003 to 2007 at MD Anderson Cancer Center revealed six cases of E. coli as the causative agent. Of these patients, all were receiving chemotherapy, five were neutropenic and two (33 %) died despite receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy with a carbapenem. Of note, all the isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and 55 % produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [239].",

The incidence of nosocomial candidal fungemia rose sharply in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At some institutions, Candida fungemia now surpasses that of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and Enterococcus spp [240]. Candida albicans is still the most common species, accounting for approximately half of fungal isolates from cancer patients, although the incidence of non-albicans species continues to increase. Among these are C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata [241\u2013243], which tend to be more resistant to the azoles and C. krusei, which is inherently azole resistant [244]. Central venous catheters, total parenteral nutrition, and the increasing use of azoles for antifungal prophylaxis are some of the presumed mechanisms thought to account for this rising trend. Oral fungal infections with both C. albicans and the non-albicans species are very common among patients with cancer of the head and neck, particularly those who have received both chemotherapy and radiation as part of their treatment regimen [245\u2013248].",

Trichosporon spp. are primarily seen in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies on high-dose corticosteroids. They most often cause central catheter-related infections, pulmonary infections, or soft tissue infections. Treatment for these infections is difficult, and relapse is common [253\u2013255]. Correct identification of the various species requires sequencing of a portion of the rRNA gene; however, this may be important clinically as they have somewhat distinct antifungal susceptibility profiles, particularly T. asahii which is highly resistant to fluconazole, the echinocandins, and amphotericin B [252].",

A subtype of S. cerevisiae, S. boulardii, is also used in probiotic preparations for the prevention and treatment for various diarrheal diseases, such as those associated with C. difficile or parenteral nutrition. Invasive infections due to S. cerevisiae and S. boulardii are rare but have increased among cancer patients since the 1990s [261]. Most cases of Saccharomyces fungemia have been associated with central venous catheter use and receipt of antibiotic therapy. Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of S. cerevisiae rather than S. boulardii infections which are seen more commonly in patients with underlying GI tract diseases and those in ICUs. Isolates of S. cerevisiae in one series demonstrated decreased susceptibility to amphotericin and to azole derivatives, and although break points have not been defined, MIC90 for fluconazole and itraconazole for S. cerevisiae are considered to be in the dose-dependent range defined for C. albicans. It is hypothesized that the use of these drugs may play a role in the emergence of S. cerevisiae infections. Although data are scarce, voriconazole seems to exhibit good efficacy against S. cerevisiae (with an MIC90 of <0.25 mg/L). No published series is available for echinocandin treatment, but preliminary data show good efficacy with caspofungin against a limited number of S. cerevisiae strains. Despite this spectrum of susceptibility, a favorable outcome has been observed even for amphotericin B or fluconazole therapy coupled with central venous catheter removal. Successful clinical outcome with these agents may be due to the low virulence of this organism [261]. At present, recommendations for treatment include withdrawal of probiotic regimens, if given, administration of an antifungal agent with activity against the organism, and removal of indwelling vascular catheters [252].",

Although it causes a syndrome of cryptococcosis similar to that of C. neoformans, primarily manifesting as pneumonia and meningitis, it is a distinct species. The pathogen C. gattii is clinically more virulent than C. neoformans, causing multiple lesions in the lungs and brain of infected patients, responding more slowly to therapy, and requiring more diagnostic follow-up evaluations [265]. Although this disease is primarily seen in immunocompetent hosts, disease has been reported in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, and underlying malignancies. Preliminary data suggest that severity of C. gattii infection is due to defective induction of host immune responses, resulting in low levels of proinflammatory cytokines that are crucial for controlling the spread of infection. Although data are limited, despite antifungal susceptibilities similar to C. neoformans in vitro, intracranial infection with C. gattii is associated with more neurological complications, a delayed response to therapy, and a higher incidence of neurosurgical intervention [263].",

The development of new molecular techniques has improved the detection of established pathogens and the identification of emerging ones and has shaped our understanding of the epidemiology and outcomes of RVIs in immunosuppressed hosts. Clinicians caring for cancer patients must familiarize themselves with respiratory viruses such as influenza, including emerging and pandemic strains; parainfluenza; respiratory syncytial virus; human metapneumovirus; coronaviruses, including SARS CoV and MERS CoV; adenovirus; rhinovirus; bocavirus; and KI and WU polyomaviruses, which have all been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract disease in this population. The incidence of RVIs following HSCT has ranged from 3.5 to 29 %; however, older studies are likely to underestimate the incidence due to less sensitive detection methodologies. Common symptoms include malaise, myalgias, fever, coryza, cough, and sore throat. Dyspnea may signal progression to lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease which is estimated to occur in 35 % of HSCT patients. Some studies suggest that RVIs may be a risk factor for the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in this population. Progression to LRT disease and worse outcome was associated with diagnosis of leukemia, age over 65 years, severe neutropenia or leukopenia, and myeloablative transplant. Cancer patients with RVIs can have prolonged shedding, creating a risk for transmission and outbreaks in institutional settings [266].",

            "text": "In addition to respiratory viruses, two community-acquired gastrointestinal viruses deserve mention. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, reactivation, prolonged viral shedding, and development of cirrhosis have been increasingly reported in immunocompromised hosts, primarily among patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation. Chronic HEV in HSCT recipients has not been as well studied, given its low endemicity in areas of the world most likely to perform HSCTs. Some case reports in patients with acute leukemia and in those who have undergone HSCT have demonstrated prolonged shedding following chemotherapy, or viral reactivation more than three months following transplantation. Given evidence for prolonged viremia and fecal shedding, the potential exists for nosocomial transmission, and this has been demonstrated in an outbreak in France. In addition to HEV, chronic norovirus infection has emerged as a viral syndrome in patients with underlying malignancies, especially hematological malignancies, and in those who have undergone HSCT. It can cause prolonged shedding and protracted disease in this population, with patients shedding virus and remaining symptomatic for months and, in some cases, for more than a year. Treatment is supportive, and resolution of disease often requires a decrease in immunosuppression and subsequent recovery of T cells. As with hepatitis E virus, prolonged viral shedding poses a risk for norovirus transmission in healthcare settings [267].",

            "text": "Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can occur in cancer patients. HBV reactivation is a well-known complication in cancer patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and other immunosuppressive therapies. Rates of reactivation vary from 14 to 72 % in published literature, and variations are associated with underlying malignancy, degree of immunosuppression, and use of prophylaxis. Patients with underlying hematological malignancies are at highest risk, and patients with lymphoma may be at particular risk; however, an increasing number of cases have been described in patients with solid tumors, especially those with breast and hepatocellular carcinomas. Other risk factors include history of high serum viral load, male sex, young age, HBeAg seropositivity, use of corticosteroids, use of certain chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and vinca alkaloids, and use of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab. In one series, the use of rituximab was associated with 39 % of reactivation cases. Syndromes associated with reactivation vary widely and range from asymptomatic disease to liver failure and death, with mortality ranging from 5 to 52 %. Prophylactic agents such as lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, or tenofovir should be started as early as possible before initiating immunosuppressive therapy in HBsAg positive patients. Although HCV infection is more common than HBV infection in cancer patients, HCV reactivation following immunosuppressive therapy is rare. Reactivation of HCV is more common in patients with hematological malignancies but has been reported in patients with solid tumors and in those who have undergone HSCT. No reliable methods exist to predict an individual patient\u2019s risk for reactivation; however, the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has traditionally been associated with reactivation disease. Controversy exists as to whether the use of rituximab is a risk factor for HCV reactivation. The clinical consequences of HCV reactivation seem to be less severe than those of HBV reactivation, with only a few deaths reported. However, if severe hepatitis secondary to viral reactivation develops, mortality rates are similar to those seen with HBV. No prophylaxis is currently approved to prevent HCV reactivation in this patient population [268].",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance is now a global crisis, and patients with underlying malignancies are disproportionally impacted by this emerging trend. Drug-resistant infections cost the United States healthcare system between $16.6 and $26 billion in extra costs annually and cost society approximately $35 billion each year in lost wages and premature deaths [269]. Antibacterial drug resistance is now commonplace among cancer patients. The incidence of penicillin resistance among viridians streptococci is increasing in both adult and pediatric cancer patients [227, 229]. The majority of enterococcal isolates colonizing allogeneic HSCT patients are now vancomycin resistant, and approximately 30 % of VRE-colonized HSCT patients subsequently develop clinical infections. According to one recent study, VRE is now the leading cause of bacteremia in the first 30 days after HSCT and is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality compared to patients without enterococcal bacteremia [270\u2013272]. In addition, daptomycin resistance is also increasing among VRE isolates [273]. Rates of MRSA are increasing among patients with breast cancer and cancers of the head and neck and, in some centers, are common causes of bacteremia in patients with febrile neutropenia [274\u2013279]. Gram-negative bacterial resistance is likewise increasing. In some series, over 80 % of E. coli isolates are fluoroquinolone resistant [280]. The presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa among cancer patients is now routinely encountered [281\u2013287]. As mentioned above, the increasing use of azoles for antifungal prophylaxis is thought to have played a role in the emergence of azole-resistant non-albicans Candida spp. such as C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei that are now commonplace in this patient population. Although less common, antiviral resistance is reported among CMV and HSV, due to the prophylactic use of acyclovir and ganciclovir, which has led to both acyclovir- and ganciclovir-resistant strains among cancer patients. To combat the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, clinicians must know and employ the strategies of infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship for these patients who are under their care.",
