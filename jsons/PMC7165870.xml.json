However, in at least one\u2010third of more severe exacerbations a cause is not identified. Antibiotic therapy is widely, and sometimes inappropriately, used in AECOPD resulting in increased risk of adverse effects and increased antibiotic resistance. Antiviral therapy for influenza viruses is available and needs to be commenced soon after the development of symptoms. Antiviral agents for other viruses including anti\u2010rhinoviral agents are in clinical development, and not yet available for routine use.",

First, viral infection may have been missed in up to one\u2010third of patients who were not tested on presentation, presumably due to lack of influenza\u2010like symptoms. As viral shedding can occur for several weeks after post\u2010infection, routine testing of all subjects may have affected the study's findings including the associations of symptoms and inflammatory markers. Second, potential selection bias relating to the indication for viral testing exists between the two cohorts limiting the capacity to compare data sets. The AECOPD cohort was a highly selected group of patients, many of whom had symptoms suggestive of a viral infection to prompt testing. In comparison, the indication for testing in the SESLHD cohort is unknown and likely to be variable, including some screening for infection control. In the future, prospective studies could address whether CRP, and perhaps pro\u2010calcitonin, could be used in addition to clinical acumen to guide empirical antimicrobial use in AECOPD. Likewise, large controlled trials of patients randomised to receive empirical antimicrobials or targeted viral therapy alone in suspected viral AECOPD may further identify subgroups which would benefit most from antimicrobial treatment.",

Amongst the AECOPD cohort, viruses appear more likely to be identified in those who present with influenza\u2010like symptoms and a low CRP. These findings support the potential role of symptoms and inflammatory markers in determining the aetiology and guiding empirical management of AECOPD. Given the prevalence of Influenza A in the AECOPD cohort, widespread vaccination may help to protect these patients and prevent hospital admission.",
