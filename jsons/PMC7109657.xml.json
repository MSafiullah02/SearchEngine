In many cases, functional RNA secondary structures are located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions (Wilkie et al., 2003), like the secondary structures involved in regulation of histone mRNA translation (Marzluff et al., 2008), the iron response elements (Anderson et al., 2012) or the gamma interferon inhibitor of translation element that is involved in limiting the cellular immune response (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2009). In many viral RNAs, RNA secondary structures in the untranslated regions regulate the viral life cycle (Liu et al., 2009). Functional RNA secondary structures in viral RNAs have also been reported in the protein-coding regions, like for the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein mRNA (Ball, 1973), for cis-replication elements (CREs) involved in the replication of plus strand RNA viruses (Fricke et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2009) or retroviruses (Konecny et al., 2000) and for the RNA encapsidation signals of betacoronaviruses (Fosmire et al., 1992) and Hepatitis B Virus (Junker-Niepmann et al., 1990). However, in the protein-coding regions of cellular mRNAs such RNA secondary structures are known to exert functions only in specific cases, like the selenocysteine insertion sequence involved in the incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine into proteins (Donovan and Copeland, 2010).",

The question arises if mRNA protein-coding regions in general have functional RNA secondary structure elements and if there is a relationship between the evolution of protein sequences and the nucleotide sequences forming RNA secondary structures. Three hypotheses have been considered (Ball, 1973): (i) codon sequence and secondary structure are independent, i.e. only the codon sequence is under selection pressure solely due to the needs of the amino acid sequence in the functional protein, and the most stable RNA secondary structure is determined only according to the requirements of the codon sequence; (ii) natural selection between synonymous codons which encode the same amino acid could permit the optimization of RNA secondary structures (Fitch, 1974) and (iii) a strong selection pressure for functional RNA secondary structures could drive the choice also of non-synonymous codons in the mRNA, leading to the choice of another amino acid according to the requirements of the RNA secondary structure (Konecny et al., 2000).",

Using RNAfold (Lorenz et al., 2011), we analyzed the occurrence of three different base pair/secondary structure classes, based on the arrangement of amino acid codons within RNA secondary structures. Each arrangement of valid base-pairs (A:U, U:A, G:C, C:G, U:G, G:U) between the codon positions 1, 2 or 3 of one codon and the codon positions 1, 2 or 3 of an opposing codon in RNA secondary structures can be grouped into the following classes: c1={1:1, 2:3, 3:2}, c2={2:2, 1:3, 3:1} and c3={3:3, 1:2, 2:1} (Fig. 1). Thereby, these sequence stretches do not need to have a length in multiples of three nucleotides to belong to the respective class, as illustrated in an artificial RNA structure (Fig. 1B). Consequently, these three base pair/RNA secondary structure classes cover virtually all possible RNA secondary structures. The frequency of these base pair/secondary structure classes was counted on a global scale in the protein-coding regions of mRNAs from viruses, bacteria, archaea, plants, fungi, invertebrates, non-mammalian vertebrates and mammalia.\n",

Conversely, the fact of an under-represented class c1 is interpreted as a selection pressure to allow RNA secondary structures in mRNA coding regions. At the same time, pairing of the nucleotides in position 2 of a codon with a nucleotide in position 3 of another codon in class c1 may be highly likely due to the degenerate nature of triplett position 3.",

The bias is not affected by the folding range of our method (see Supplementary Material and Supplementary Fig. S2) and occurs not by chance (Supplementary Fig. S4). We can also find the same effect if we use other folding algorithms, such as CONTRAfold (Do et al., 2006), a secondary structure prediction method based on conditional log-linear models (data not shown). Furthermore, if we consider the complete ensemble of RNA secondary structures, we find the same bias (see Supplementary Material and Supplementary Fig. S3). The effect disappears after artificial shuffling of the underlying RNA sequences with a word size of one or two, but remains with a shuffling of word size three or six (conserving the underlying codons and di-codons, Supplementary Fig. S4), showing the effect being not specific to the nucleotide distribution (like GC content) but specific for the underlying codon distribution. Moreover, if we build artificial codons but keep the nucleotide distribution per codon position constant, the effect remains the same (Supplementary Fig. S5). This demonstrates that the global nucleotide distribution per codon position but not the codon itself is important.",

Compared to the low structured mRNAs (Fig. 3A), we found a slight increase of cytosin and guanin content at codon positions 1 and 2 in the structured mRNAs but a strong increase at codon position 3 (Fig. 3B). Based on the higher G/C content, the G:C base-pairing was significantly increased. There seems to be a consistent trend over all organisms that the increase in G/C content among the base-pairs of one class occurs to a large extent in those base-pairs which are involved in a pairing with a codon position 3 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The largest differences were found in 1:3, 3:1, 2:3, 3:2 and 3:3 pairings, whereas no big changes were found in 1:1, 2:2, 1:2 and 2:1 pairings (Supplementary Fig. S6). This shows that an increase in G/C content in more structured mRNAs occurred mainly in the wobble position 3, leaving the amino acid sequence largely unchanged. In turn, this suggests that the co-evolution of amino acid sequence and RNA secondary structures may have been mainly driven by the amino acid sequence. Conversely, it appears difficult to estimate at this global scale if the RNA secondary structure influences the amino acid sequence by the choice of non-synonymous codons. Even though the pronounced base-pair bias in all taxonomic groups supports the presence of structured mRNAs in vivo, up to now we are aware of only a few functional RNA structures in mRNA coding regions (Ball, 1973; Fosmire et al., 1992; Fricke et al., 2015; Konecny et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2009; Nassal et al., 1990).\n",

In class c2 RNA secondary structures, pairing of two opposing nucleotides in position 2 of each codon would be required. However, variation in this position would likely change the hydrophobic versus hydrophilic nature of the amino acids. Thus, the under-representation of class c2 in plastid genomes may be due to the fact that plastid genomes largely encode those highly hydrophobic membrane proteins which are involved in plastid redox metabolism to allow for short regulatory gene expression circuits (Allen, 2015). This effect appears particularly pronounced in animal mitochondria which have lost all protein-coding genes that do not encode respiratory chain complex subunits (Lang et al., 1999). Here, only class c2 but not class c1 is under-represented (Fig. 4). This suggests that in these animal mitochondrial sequences exclusively coding for those subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes that are located in the membrane (Soto et al., 2012; Wirth et al., 2016), hydropathy has become the most important parameter for codon selection.\n",

Without taking the underlying codon frequency into account, the possible base-pair distribution of classes c1, c2 and c3 would be identical (33.3% each). In contrast, when we weight each possible base pair between the codons with the underlying codon frequency, we found a slight under-representation of class c1 (see Table 1, left part).

On the other hand, a recent study of yeast mRNAs found a positive correlation of mRNA secondary structure with protein abundance, without affecting mRNA half-life (Zur and Tuller, 2012). For this finding, Mao et al. proposed a possible explanation that appears counter-intuitive at first sight. By computational methods they found that moderate RNA secondary structures may increase ribosomal density and therewith translation rate (Mao et al., 2014). Their interpretation is that the first ribosomes that encounter the coding region are slowed down by RNA secondary structures. Then, all following ribosomes catch up closely to create a line of migrating ribosomes which will disable reformation of RNA secondary structures and thus translate the mRNA with high efficiency.",
