Nasal respiratory epithelial cells and olfactory epithelial support cells have been shown to express high levels of ACE2 proteins used by the SARS-Cov2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 syndrome, to infect cells [2]. Previously described human strains of coronavirus have also been demonstrated to invade the central nervous system and propagate from within the olfactory bulb [3]. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that alterations in sense of smell would be reported by patients with COVID-19.",

Within 24 h of sending approximately 300 email replies, 710 respondents had completed the survey. At 7 days, 2428 responses had been received, after sending a link to the survey in approximately 600 emails in response to patient queries, suggesting wider dissemination. The findings from this primary survey are reported elsewhere [6]. The database was checked for duplicate replies, but all completed surveys appeared unique. After confirmation that ethical approval was not required to allow patients wishing to participate in future studies to leave contact details, an optional box was added, 613 patients with known email contact details were contacted to complete a second survey 1 week after the completion of the first. Patients were allowed 72 h to complete the survey. Surveys were matched using email addresses, and then an anonymised database was used for analysis.",

At the time of completion of the second survey, there is significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss (P < 0.001, Mann Whitney U 16131.5), (Fig. 2). 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% report no problem at all at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell. This is reflected in the overall cumulative response rate of 79% patients overall stating that they had noticed improvement at the time of either the first or second survey. The time of reporting improvement in relation to the time of onset is shown in Fig. 3. At the first survey, only 13% of patients who had developed loss sense of smell in the preceding week had noticed improvement, compared with 35% 1\u20132 weeks after onset, 61% 2\u20133 weeks after onset, 67% for those between 3 and 4 weeks from onset, and 75% of those whose loss of sense of smell had first started more than 4 weeks earlier. There appears to be significant improvement in the first 2 weeks but then the recovery rate appears to plateau. Although the numbers are too small to make meaningful conclusions (n = 7), the overall recovery rate reported in those of 3 weeks duration or longer is 71%.\n",

At the time of writing, there are a number of letters available in Medline, repeating the largely anecdotal reports. A small case-series of patients seen by the primary author [7], prompting the original press-release, and the initial results of the survey have been published [6], reporting on 2428 patients presenting with recent onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic, of whom 16% report loss of sense of smell as an isolated symptom. However, the majority of patients described in our series are not eligible for testing, which is currently only available in the UK for patients hospitalised with severe disease.

Using all the data collected, the King\u2019s research team developed a model to identify which combination of symptoms together could predict COVID-19 cases which include a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. The strongest predictor is loss of smell and taste. In a similar study, Yan et al. found smell and taste lost were reported by 68 and 71% of COVID positive patients respectively, compared to 16 and 17% of COVID negative patients, with loss of sense of smell being the strongest predictor (OR 10.9 for COVID-19 positivity) [13].",

We cannot attribute any prognostic significance to the presence of anosmia without widespread epidemiologic study across large populations, but there do appear to be 2 different phenotypes of COVID-19 disease; those with mild disease where anosmia is prevalent, found more often in younger and female patients, and those with moderate to severe respiratory disease, seen more frequently in older and male patients.

At the follow-up survey, most of these patients had developed other symptoms, but only 50% reported a cough or fever across either survey. Overall, nearly 1 in 4 respondents reported anosmia as an isolated symptom, or as the first presenting symptom. Using current World Health Organisation and Public Health England definitions, half of the participants of this survey would not currently be suspected to have COVID19 and may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of infection, as they do not meet criteria where self-isolation would be recommended. Formal recognition of loss of smell and taste as a marker of infection, to allow identification of paucisymptomatic patients is critical to reduce transmission when capacity for formal testing is limited.",

Our study shows that nearly 80% of patients report improvement in loss of sense of smell within a few weeks of onset, with recovery appearing to plateau after 3 weeks. Lower rates of spontaneous recovery have been previously been reported with post-viral anosmia, ranging from 32% [15] to 67% [16] in the absence of any active treatment. It is likely that many of cases of loss of sense of smell of short duration would normally go unreported, and only patients with symptoms of longer duration would seek medical advice. The 71% recovery rate reported in those of duration of 3 weeks or more is more in keeping with previously reported studies. Long-term studies of COVID-19 survivors are required, as well research to determine for how long patients may remain infectious.",

Hopefully, patients will be seen after a period where viral shedding has ceased, but appropriate personal protective equipment will still be required if seeing cases of new onset. Nasal endoscopy should not be performed within the first 2 weeks of onset, unless there are other red-flag symptoms (notably, blood stained discharge). Although a number of different treatments have been described almost all trials reported have very small numbers, most lack a blinded, randomised, control arm and rates of improvement are usually no greater than reported rates of spontaneous improvement. A meta-analysis of 13 studies of olfactory training suggests small to moderate benefit [17]; we found no difference in early improvement rates in our study, however numbers using OT were very small, and training over at least 12 weeks is recommended. Current WHO guidance (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf) is to avoid the use of systemic steroids in cases with or at risk of severe acute respiratory COVID-19 as systematic review suggests possible harm including delayed viral clearance; this recommendation appears to have been well observed with only 3 patients reporting having taken them.",

The majority of our cohort do meet current criteria for testing in the UK, as it is only being undertaken in hospitalised patients, however, of those tested in our survey, 80% were found to be positive, While we do not know the means of testing, but in most cases, RT-PCR analysis of nasal swabs has been used, which have an estimated sensitivity of 72% [18]. Many patients also reported other symptoms described in COVID-19 infection, with half also reporting a new onset cough or fever, therefore making COVID-19 likely according to the results of Menni et al. [12] and Yan et al. [13]. However, our assumption that our cohort reflects patients with COVID-19 cannot be proven without test results even though it is supported by the evince base. Post-viral anosmia is a common cause of olfactory loss, and transient loss is likely under-reported such that the true incidence is unknown. Our cases may have been caused by unrelated rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, that would have previously gone unreported, were it not for the attention COVID19 has attracted in the media. We cannot, therefore estimate the overall prevalence of anosmia in those infected with COVID-19. However, until widespread testing in the community is undertaken, any study in only those with confirmed COVID-19 to also prone to selection bias in evaluating a more severely affected, and likely older cohort requiring hospital admission. The benefit of this study is that it may offer a picture of patients who would likely be missed by current diagnostic criteria, and studies of selected populations with severe disease requiring hospitalisation or targeted testing regimens.",
