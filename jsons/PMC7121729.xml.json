In 1992 for example the US Institute of Medicine issued a report which warned \u201csome infectious diseases that now affect people in other parts of the world represent potential threats to the United States because of global interdependence, modern transportation, trade and changing social and cultural patterns\u201d (Lederberg et al, 1992, pv). Framing infectious disease in this way was part of a growing appreciation that a series of new security challenges, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and environmental degradation, were supplanting the more traditional state centric national security concerns of the Cold War era. (Brower and Chalk, 2003) As remarked upon by James Woolsey during his nomination hearing for director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1993: \u201cIn many ways today\u2019s threats are harder to observe and understand\u2026Yes, we have slain a large dragon, but now find ourselves living in a jungle with a bewildering number of poisonous snakes\u201d (Woolsey, 1993, p76).",

However a declassified National Intelligence Estimate from January 2000 expanded the scope of diseases that might pose security concerns. The report noted, for example, that since 1973 at least thirty previously unknown diseases had been identified and at least twenty older infectious diseases had re-emerged or spread geographically over the same period frequently in drug resistant form. The authors of the report believed that \u201cThe spread of infectious diseases results as much from changes in human behaviour \u2013 including lifestyles and land use patterns, increased trade and travel, and inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs\u2013as from mutations in pathogens\u201d and suggested that,new and re-emerging infectious diseases will pose a rising global health threat and will complicate US and global security over the next 20 years. These diseases will endanger US citizens at home and abroad, threaten US armed forces deployed overseas, and exacerbate social and political instability in key countries and regions in which the United States has significant interests.

Whilst this session is often remarked upon for ultimately leading to resolution 1308 on the Responsibility of the Security Council in the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: HIV/AIDS and International Peace-keeping Operations, it was the discussions within the session that did much to characterise the evolving nature of the relationship between infectious disease and security concerns. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, for example, noted that the impact of AIDS in Africa was \u201cno less destructive than that of warfare itself and by some measures it was far worse\u201d and went on:Nowhere else had AIDS become a threat to economic, social and political stability on the scale that it now was in Southern and Eastern Africa\u2026In already unstable societies\u2026that cocktail of disasters was a sure recipe for more conflict. And conflict, in turn, provided fertile ground for further infections. The breakdown of health and education services, the obstruction of humanitarian assistance, the displacement of whole populations and a high infection rate among soldiers\u2026all ensured that the epidemic spread ever further and faster.

In line with the \u201csecuritization\u201d thesis, political interest in HIV/AIDS has remained high and superior financial resources have indeed been accessed. This included US President George W. Bush promising $15 billion over five years to international HIV/AIDS programmes in his 2003 State of the Union Speech. However, \u200bSelgelid and Enemark (2012) note that HIV/AIDS is a disease of attrition, meaning that \u201cthe effects of these diseases are relatively familiar and slow-acting, they do not concentrate the minds of people and politicians as readily as an unfamiliar and sudden outbreak crisis.\u201d Consequently it was growing anxiety over a perceived new type of terrorist that may deliberately use infectious disease to further their aims which gave further salience to the relationship between infectious disease and security concerns.",

Though the events themselves were quite unrelated to biological weapons (i.e. the hostile use of disease), the idea that non state actors, including terrorists, might seek to employ biological weapons to further their aims was lifted from (arguably) a niche concern to a mainstream security issue. Calling it niche is not to say that bioterrorism had not been considered a security threat prior to 2001 \u2013 many commentators had noted the potential (see for example Stern, 1993; Tucker, 1996, 2000; Moodie and Roberts, 1997; Smithson and Levy, 2000); table top exercises had been conducted, domestic preparedness programmes initiated (Guillemin, 2011, p7), and in countries such as the US, policy directives had been crafted that gave the highest priority to \u201cdeveloping effective capabilities to detect, prevent, defeat and manage the consequences of nuclear, biological or chemical materials or weapons use by terrorists\u201d (United States, 1995). However what the 9/11 attacks did was alter the global frame of reference about what terrorists writ large might now be prepared to undertake. The attacks appeared to suggest that what had been considered previously as restraining factors on terrorist actions, such as limiting casualties so as not to \u201crisk of alienating the public especially their own supporters\u201d were no longer valid (Butler, 2004, p30). Instead this new breed of terrorist and extremist appeared to want to cause casualties on a massive scale, and appeared undeterred by the fear of alienating the public, their own supporters, or indeed by considerations of personal survival.",

Twenty-one others went on to be diagnosed with either inhalational or cutaneous forms of anthrax and five more people died. The source of the exposure was five letters containing anthrax spores anonymously posted to media outlets and members of the Senate. Coming so soon after the 9/11 attacks, these letters created a near hysterical atmosphere. Tucker writes:Cable news networks hyped the bioterrorism threat with apocalyptic scenarios; postal workers sorted mail wearing rubber gloves and surgical masks; thousands of Senate staff members were put on prophylactic antibiotics; and letters addressed to government officials were irradiated with electron beams to kill lingering spores, delaying mail for weeks. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of ordinary Americans stockpiled ciprofloxacin (a potent antibiotic with potentially dangerous side effects), snapped up gas masks of questionable effectiveness from army supply stores and hoarded canned food and bottled water in anticipation of spreading epidemics and quarantines.

And at the political level, European countries acted at both the community level and national level. In October 2001 for example, the heads of state and government asked for a European level programme to be prepared to improve the cooperation between member states for the evaluation of risks, alerts, and intervention, and the collaboration in the field of research. At the national level many European countries re-examined their preparedness plans and strengthened or implemented new measures designed to prevent the misuse of the biological sciences. This included placing restrictions on physical access to, and work performed with, certain pathogens labelled as \u201cdangerous.\u201d2 European states were not alone in re-examining their preparedness programmes: in the US for example, at least three new pieces of legislation were enacted in quick succession aimed at preventing the misuse of disease and they significantly increased their investment in bio-defences, including medical countermeasures.3\n",

The focus prior to 2001 had been state level adherence to the norms of the BWC. However if properly implemented at the national level, the Convention addresses potential terrorist use by transferring the obligations that states agree to \u2013 not to develop, produce, manufacture or stockpile biological and toxin weapons or methods of delivery of such weapons \u2013 onto individuals in their territory or under their jurisdiction anywhere. When tabling a number of proposals for future work in late 2001 the US delegation noted that \u201cmany of these ideas will bear little resemblance to the traditional arms control measures of the past\u201d including the negotiation of a legally binding verification protocol which had recently failed (US Department of State, 2001). These alternative proposals eventually initiated an \u201cintersessional process\u201d where states parties to the BWC meet twice yearly to discuss, promote common understanding and achieve effective action on a number of topics related to this broadened understanding of biological threats.5\n",

(WHO, 2004) Unlike the apocalyptic \u201cdread risk\u201d scenarios for bioterrorism attacks in the same period, SARS was a \u201cdread reality\u201d: evidence showed SARS to be a fast spreading disease that did not require a vector; symptoms appeared to begin an average of four days after exposure to an infected person and mimicked many common diseases \u2013 high fever, a dry cough and shortness of breath (WHO, 2007) and the disease showed no particular geographical affinity. Indeed on this last point an association was made early on between SARS and travel on commercial airlines (see for example Olsen et al, 2003) which resulted in guidelines being issued regarding travel to and from areas affected by SARS that focused on hand hygiene and specified that anyone suspected of having SARS should wear a facemask. However, public perception of the risk of becoming infected with SARS led to widespread use of facemasks whether on a flight or not (see for example Hesketh, 2003, p1095).",

Writing in the New York Times members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Barak Obama and Richard Lugar, framed the relationship between national security and an influenza pandemic as follows:When we think of major threats to our national security the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation, rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores, one from nature not humans \u2013 an avian flu pandemic. An outbreak could cause millions of deaths, destablize Southeast Asia\u2026and threaten the security of governments around the world (Obama and Lugar, 2005)\n",

This intelligence had been gathered by GOARN\u2019s early warning element which collects and verifies reports and rumours of epidemics from a wide variety of unofficial sources, including nongovernmental organisations, news media, electronic discussion groups such as the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, and other official surveillance networks. When the WHO was eventually able to act, the response side of GOARN was activated and within a period of weeks after the first recognised case, a virtual network of eleven leading infectious disease laboratories in nine countries had been established. Connected by a secure website and daily teleconferences, the laboratories collaborated to identify the causative agent of SARS and to develop a diagnostic test; similar groups were also created to pool clinical knowledge and compare epidemiological data on SARS (Knobler et al, 2004). The WHO used this information to make recommendations on patient management which included issuing travel recommendations in an attempt to curb, and eventually stop, the international spread of this newly recognised virus (Heymann, 2004).",

The review of the WHO\u2019s response noted above was extremely critical of the response effort on a number of levels. Regarding the actions of the WHO itself, the panel\u2019s assessment regarded there to have been \u201csignificant and unjustifiable delays\u201d in declaring the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, despite early warnings about the outbreak from its own staff and from non governmental organisations such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, and that the \u201cWHO does not currently possess the capacity or organizational culture to deliver a full emergency public health response\u201d (WHO, 2015, p6). Part of the reason for this is that there are no core funds for emergency response and the panel recommended the immediate creation of a contingency fund in support of outbreak response as well as the establishment of a WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response which would develop the necessary new structures and procedures to achieve full preparedness and response capacity.",

What had previously been considered as two separate domains \u2013 public health and national security \u2013 have now become merged to create a spectrum of biosecurity issues that encompasses naturally occurring incidents, accidental outbreaks and deliberate use of infectious disease. This intertwining is reflected in both domains: in the public health domain, the WHO for example had its mandate extended to include responding to deliberate use of biological agents and in the traditional arms control arena, states parties to the Biological Weapons Convention are creating synergistic relations with public health organisations to further their aims of mitigating the effects of a deliberate use should it occur. In addition, the Global Health Security Agenda also reflects a change in views regarding responsibility for responding to this spectrum of biosecurity issues: whereas in 2000 the Security Council viewed HIV/AIDS as posing a threat to a geographically defined area, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the potential of an influenza pandemic shortly thereafter illustrated the truly global interconnected nature of the threat and so the shared international responsibility of responding to them. To use an argument put forward by Andrew Lakoff and Stephan Collier (2008), the issue for the future is not whether a disease outbreak can be characterised as a biosecurity threat which requires attention but what kind of biosecurity problem does it present, what kind of techniques are used to assess them and what is the most appropriate kinds of responses.",
