The compensatory ventilatory response to hypoxaemia, increased minute ventilation, may lead to extreme hypocapnia. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) diffuses through tissues about 20 times more rapidly than does oxygen (O 2 ), and these properties likely underlie the disproportional pulmonary exchange of CO 2 and O 2 in these patients. The pathoanatomical and pathophysiological basis for respiratory failure in COVID-19 is yet undetermined, but diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial thickening leading to compromised gas exchange is a plausible mechanism. 2 Varying degrees of atelectasis and consolidation likely contribute.",

This phenomenon has been coined \"silent hypoxia\". End-tidal CO 2 values in the 1.4-2.0 kPa range have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but apart from a rapid respiratory rate the clinical presentation in these patients can be misleading. We have observed patients with extreme hypoxaemia showing little distress; rather they tend to be impassive, cooperative and haemodynamically stable. However, sudden and rapid respiratory decompensation may occur. This particular clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients contrasts with our previous experience with critically ill patients in respiratory failure in which patients with decompensated heart failure, sepsis, or massive pulmonary embolism tend to present with air hunger, dyspnoea, distress, arterial hypotension, and isocapnic or hypercapnic hypoxia.",

The respiratory alkalosis shifts the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, thereby increasing haemoglobin's oxygen affinity, evident from a decrease in the P 50 value and an increase in arterial oxygen saturation (S a O 2 ). 4 Additionally, the alveolar gas equation predicts that decreased alveolar CO 2 tension (P A CO 2 ) will result in a corresponding increase in alveolar oxygen tension (P A O 2 ).",

In a simulated high-altitude parachute jump from 30.000 ft, nine volunteers from the Norwegian Special Operations Command underwent repeated blood gas testing while breathing air at different ambient pressures. 5 Extreme hypocapnic hypoxia in patients with respiratory failure has previously been relatively unusual, therefore this presentation challenges our intuitive thinking and clinical pattern recognition. The physiology of hypocapnic hypoxia has implications for how we interpret physiological parameters. Instinctively, we judge an S p O 2 value of 93% as fair. However, without knowledge of the accompanying P a CO 2 value it is impossible to infer from S p O 2 the degree of hypoxaemia and consequently the severity of the respiratory failure.",

Ensuring timely hospital admission can therefore be challenging. These patients are evaluated by general practitioners, often by telephone due to quarantine rules, or by paramedics or emergency physicians in a pre-hospital context. To assess the risk of imminent respiratory failure, clinical evaluation should give emphasis to respiratory rate, work of breathing, use of accessory musculature, and skin perfusion. Pulse oximetry readings should be interpreted in the light of P a CO 2 values or while acknowledging the absence of this important information. Although arterial-alveolar difference in PCO 2 increases during low cardiac output states and increased dead space ventilation, end-tidal CO 2 values have been reported to correlate well with P a CO 2 in non-intubated patients, especially during hypocapnia 6 . End-tidal CO 2 can be easily measured in a pre-hospital setting.",

In the case of intubation one should consider the danger of apnoea during induction of anaesthesia. In marginal patients with severe hypocapnic hypoxia, a rise in P a CO 2 will lead to a right shift of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, resulting in an abrupt fall in S a O 2 and a risk of circulatory collapse.",

Interestingly, a wide range of S a O 2 values across individuals were found for any given inspiratory oxygen pressure. At ambient pressure 42.1 kPa, corresponding to a pressure altitude of approximately 22,000 ft, S a O 2 values ranged from 52% to 90%, with corresponding values of P a CO 2 of 2.16-4.17 kPa and P a O 2 of 3.22-5.61 kPa. One individual achieved SaO 2 of 90% with P a O 2 of 5.6 kPa and P a CO 2 of 2.16 kPa, illustrating how a relatively high S a O 2 value can be found despite a very low P a O 2 . Linear regression analysis (Figure) estimates the effect size of hyperventilation, i.e., how at one given inspiratory PO 2 a change in P a CO 2 affects S a O 2 . Such visualization can contribute to a better understanding of how substantially a left shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve changes S a O 2 .",
