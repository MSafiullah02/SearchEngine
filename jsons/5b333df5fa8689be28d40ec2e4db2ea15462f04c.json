A few days before the child's presentation, the mother, a 29-year-old woman with no medical history, presented with rhinopharyngitis. She felt progressively tired and had a fever, cough, polypnea, thoracic pain, and headache. She was referred to the M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection University Hospital Institute where she was diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab [1] . She was hospitalized in the Contagious Infections Diseases Department. Low-dose computed tomography showed bilateral, asymmetrical, peripheral frosted-glass images and two alveolar condensation foci in two different segments of the right lung. This was compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. The mother was treated with oral hydroxychloroquine and oral azithromycin [2] . On the fourth day of treatment, the results of her nasopharyngeal samples were negative and within 8 days she was discharged from hospital and followed up as an outpatient.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a liver transplantation patient with COVID-19. Although children seem to have a less severe reaction to COVID-19 than J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 adults [3] , even when they have significant health complications [4] , there have been some doubts regarding immunosuppression therapy and the risk of severe infections as they are usually negatively correlated. An immunocompromised state has been associated with increased risk of severe lower respiratory tract disease in patients with coronavirus [5] . Contrary to other viruses, during the COVID-19 infection, the host's innate immune response seems to be the main cause of lung tissue damage [6] . It should be noted that the most important factors in adult patients are age, sex, and a history of hypertension [7] . A report of the successful recovery of 52-year-old renal transplantation patient was recently published [8] .",

A single study conducted in China aimed to assess the role of EBV co-infection during COVID-19. In all, 35 out of 62 COVID-19 patients (56.5%) were seropositive for EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM antibody, which reflects an acute EBV infection or reactivation [10] . EBV was reported to be correlated with a more severe course of COVID-19. The authors noted that EBV-positive COVID-19 patients had a 3.64-fold higher risk of presenting with fever (95% CI: 1.26-10.5;",

The median recovery time for EBV-seropositive COVID-19 patients was higher than for EBV-negative patients, without being statistically significant (p=0.07) [10] . These authors hypothesized that EBV infection and COVID-19 share some pathogenic characteristics such as an overactivation of T cells, which can lead to severe immune injury [11] . In fact, even if EBV infection is often asymptomatic [12] , some people present with fever, asthenia, myalgia, sore throat, anorexia, skin rash, and the disease can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised individuals [13] . Therefore, the clinical case of our young immunocompromised patient recovering from EBV infection at the same time as COVID-19 is particularly interesting.",

A mild increase in the GGT level (approx. 2 ULN) after 96 days of transplantation prompted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) examinations, which showed a mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tract possibly linked to an anastomotic stenosis. Moreover, the girl presented with an asymptomatic EBV primary infection linked to the transplantation (the father was EBV positive) with a high viral load in the blood. A radiological angioplasty procedure was planned. She weighed approximately 15 kg and her usual treatment consisted of tacrolimus (0.07 mg/kg b.i.d.), acetylsalicylic acid (4.7 mg/kg qd), and ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg b.i.d.).",

She had no inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein [CRP], 3.2 mg/L), and her chest radiography showed a focal alveolar condensation of the lingula and a stable mediastinal enlargement. The results of her liver function tests were worse when compared with the results during her last hospitalization in February. The girl showed signs of anicteric cholestasis (GGT approx. 5 ULN) and cytolysis (AST approx. 4 ULN, ALT approx. 3 ULN). US of the liver showed an aggravation of the transplanted biliary tract stenosis and an elevated EBV blood viral load (1,560,000 copies/mL). She was not subjected to COVID-19-specific treatment. The girl's health improved by treating the symptoms using 15 mg/kg of paracetamol every 6 h. Her nasopharyngeal swab samples came back negative 11 days after the first positive test. She recovered from COVID-19 despite the high level of immunosuppression caused by her tacrolimus treatment (T0 8.8 ng/mL). We reduced the dose of tacrolimus to 0.04 mg/kg b.i.d. Management of the liver transplant was organized 1 week after this acute event.",
