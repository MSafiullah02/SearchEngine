Children rarely have severe clinical illness but the infection attack rate in a household study was similar for children and adults [23].

The Korean response also included extensive testing and the outbreak in and up to the 28th March 2020, 387,925 tests were performed, 9,478 cases were identified of which 144 died. The epidemic curve in Korea is shown in Figure [24].

A total of 1,101 cases were hospitalized in the ICU out of which 783 were intubated. \u0130stanbul has the highest number of cases (n = 8852) compared to others followed by \u0130zmir (n = 853), Ankara (n = 712) and Konya (n = 584) [35]. Detailed information is not available on gender, age, clinical stage and prognosis of the identified cases. The start of the epidemic shows great similarity with the rapidly rising trend observed at the early stages in Italy and Spain. Although the health authorities and the government in Turkey were quick to take action by cancelling schools and social, cultural, sports activities and scientific meetings, a nationwide lockdown was not put into practice. A rough estimation of the number of ill people and the number of deaths for Istanbul (20 million inhabitants) according to different scenarios from different countries and provinces (Table 1) shows that the consequences of an epidemic similar to that in Italy would be devastating.",
