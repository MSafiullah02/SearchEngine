We consider a variant on a lattice of the so-called Waxman model [15] , where N \u00bc L d nodes are distributed on an hypercube of linear size L with spacing a \u2261 1, and edges are drawn with probabilities P ij \u221d \u03bae \u2212d ij =\u03b6 , for every pair of nodes i, j placed at the Euclidean distance d ij . Like in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks, the parameter \u03ba\u2261hki=\u00f0N \u22121\u00de controls the density of links, with hki the average connectivity, while \u03b6 \u2208 \u00f00; L is a characteristic link length. Although simplistic, the exponential wiring cost function of this model correctly fits the spatial distribution of link lengths observed in communication systems [16] , like the Internet [17, 18] or transport networks [19, 20] , interactions based on similarity in social networks [21] , and recent experimental results [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] support the existence of scaleinvariant organizational principles in the connectome of mammals based on it.",

            "text": "This disordered lattice is a natural benchmark for investigating crossover phenomena [27, 28] in spatial networks. Depending on the values of \u03b6, in fact, our model crosses over between two limiting regimes: for \u03b6 \u223c O\u00f0L\u00de, all link lengths are equally probable (i.e., P ij \u223c \u03ba) and we recover a random, ER-like structure, whilst for \u03b6 \u223c O\u00f01= ffiffi ffi \u03c1 p \u00de (where \u03c1 is the average density of nodes), long links are prohibited, leading instead to a latticelike topology. By performing site percolation [29-31], we disclose an intriguing scenario: while far from criticality the random part of the giant component crosses over to a spatial regime at the characteristic scale \u03b6, close to the percolation threshold it surprisingly extends in space until the intrinsic scale \u03be \u00c3 \u00f0\u03b6\u00de \u00bc \u03b6 6=\u00f06\u2212d\u00de , for d < 6. We call this structural expansion of mean-field regimes the critical stretching, and we explore its universal features by means of scaling arguments, and simulations in d \u00bc 2. In particular, because the structure affects the collective phenomena occurring on it, the critical stretching should be reflected in processes evolving on this spatial network. We verify this claim on an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) process [32] , where the mean-field (diffusive) regime of the outbreak front's velocity undergoes a temporal critical stretching, making the epidemic invade the system at \"slow\" rates for significantly longer times. Crossover and critical stretching.-To investigate the structural crossover, we perform site percolation by randomly removing a fraction 1 \u2212 p of the network's nodes, for given average degree hki \u00bc 4 and varying [33] characteristic link-lengths. For increasing \u03b6, a rapid monotonic decrease of the percolation threshold p c from the lattice value to the ER one p MF c \u00bc 1=hki is observed [ Fig. 1(b) , and Ref. [20] ]. To analyze the response the scaling of percolation observables have to this variation, we consider the correlation length \u03be 2 \u00f0p\u00de \u2254 R r 2 g\u00f0r; p\u00dedr= R g\u00f0r; p\u00dedr, where g\u00f0r; p\u00de is the pair connectivity function for a given occupation probability p. By definition, \u03be measures the mean distance between sites belonging to the same cluster, PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 123, 088301 (2019) 0031-9007=19=123(8)=088301 (5) 088301-1",

Despite the many advances made in the study of critical phenomena [4] on random networks, their analysis in the presence of a geometric embedding has remained an important theoretical challenge, so far grounded on very little analytical results [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . This represents today a fundamental barrier in the understanding of complex systems of great interest, like networks of neurons [10, 11] , communication [12] and transportation systems [13] , or power-grids [14] , whose functioning strongly intertwines their spatial constraints.",

            "text": "This disordered lattice is a natural benchmark for investigating crossover phenomena [27, 28] in spatial networks. Depending on the values of \u03b6, in fact, our model crosses over between two limiting regimes: for \u03b6 \u223c O\u00f0L\u00de, all link lengths are equally probable (i.e., P ij \u223c \u03ba) and we recover a random, ER-like structure, whilst for \u03b6 \u223c O\u00f01= ffiffi ffi \u03c1 p \u00de (where \u03c1 is the average density of nodes), long links are prohibited, leading instead to a latticelike topology. By performing site percolation [29] [30] [31] , we disclose an intriguing scenario: while far from criticality the random part of the giant component crosses over to a spatial regime at the characteristic scale \u03b6, close to the percolation threshold it surprisingly extends in space until the intrinsic scale \u03be \u00c3 \u00f0\u03b6\u00de \u00bc \u03b6 6=\u00f06\u2212d\u00de , for d < 6. We call this structural expansion of mean-field regimes the critical stretching, and we explore its universal features by means of scaling arguments, and simulations in d \u00bc 2. In particular, because the structure affects the collective phenomena occurring on it, the critical stretching should be reflected in processes evolving on this spatial network. We verify this claim on an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) process [32] , where the mean-field (diffusive) regime of the outbreak front's velocity undergoes a temporal critical stretching, making the epidemic invade the system at \"slow\" rates for significantly longer times. Crossover and critical stretching.-To investigate the structural crossover, we perform site percolation by randomly removing a fraction 1 \u2212 p of the network's nodes, for given average degree hki \u00bc 4 and varying [33] characteristic link-lengths. For increasing \u03b6, a rapid monotonic decrease of the percolation threshold p c from the lattice value to the ER one p MF c \u00bc 1=hki is observed [ Fig. 1(b) , and Ref. [20] ]. To analyze the response the scaling of percolation observables have to this variation, we consider the correlation length \u03be 2 \u00f0p\u00de \u2254 R r 2 g\u00f0r; p\u00dedr= R g\u00f0r; p\u00dedr, where g\u00f0r; p\u00de is the pair connectivity function for a given occupation probability p. By definition, \u03be measures the mean distance between sites belonging to the same cluster, and it diverges as p approaches p c like \u03be \u223c jp \u2212 p c j \u2212\u03bd d . Numerical results [ Fig. 1 (a)] for networks in d \u00bc 2, display excellent agreement with the critical exponents expected in the two limiting cases, i.e., \u03bd 2D \u00bc 4=3 for \u03b6 \u223c O\u00f01\u00de and \u03bd MF \u00bc 1=2 for \u03b6 \u223c O\u00f0L\u00de, further showing that a crossover from the former to the latter regime occurs closer and closer to p c for increasing \u03b6.",

To obtain this condition, we noticed that the scale up to which the meanfield regime extends in the giant cluster is \u03be MF \u221d \u03b6\u03be l 1=2 , where \u03be l \u00f0u\u00de \u223c u \u22121 is the (dimensionless) correlation length in chemical space, and the factor \u03b6 takes into account the characteristic length of links [35] .

Equation ( 2) provides a geometric formulation of the LG criterion at criticality, upon which density fluctuations of the spanning cluster are negligible as far as r \u226a \u03b6 6=\u00f06\u2212d\u00de . This result enables testing the critical stretching of the highdimensional (mean-field) regime of the networks' structure by comparing its geometric features at and away from criticality. With this aim, we focus on two exponents: (i) the shortest-path fractal dimension d min , and (ii) the mass fractal dimension d f of the incipient cluster [30] . Although the analysis could be carried out in any dimension d < 6, we restrict here to the case d \u00bc 2 for simplicity of computation. Let us start from the behavior at p \u00bc p c . (i) By definition, d min regulates the scaling of the mean Euclidean distance hri between sites in the giant cluster separated by the chemical distance l, so that l \u223c hri d min for hri large enough. For future reference, we consider the reciprocal scaling hri \u223c l 1=d min , for l large enough. In chemical space, \u03be \u00c3 translates [35] into the quantity \u03be \u00c3 l \u2261 bu \u22121 \u00c3 c \u00bc b\u03b6c (where the brackets denote the floor function) which, consistently with the scaling ansatz in Eq.

In defining d min , we must thus consider two regimes: l \u226a \u03be \u00c3 l where d MF min \u00bc 2 (i.e., random walk), and l \u226b \u03be \u00c3 l where instead d 2D min \u2243 1.13077\u00f02\u00de [36] .

In this case, the Euclidean dimension d \u00bc 2 is expected to regulate the scaling of M for distances r \u223c O\u00f0\u03be \u00d7 \u00de, while an infinitedimensional (small-world) behavior should be observed for r \u223c o\u00f0\u03be \u00d7 \u00de.

Besides of theoretical interest, these results are relevant for the analysis of spreading processes in realworld systems, e.g., in virus propagation on wireless networks [16] , in the spreading of diseases through transportation systems [19, 20] or of rumors in social networks [21] , whose spatial constraints are well captured by the exponential wiring cost function here adopted.",

            "text": "Discussion.-In this Letter, we have investigated the effects that a tunable characteristic link length \u03b6 has on the critical phenomena in spatial networks. We studied the spatiotemporal location where a crossover from random (mean-field) to spatial regimes takes place when considering the network away from (p \u226b p c ) or close to (p \u2192 p c ) its percolation threshold. We found that while this crossover occurs at \u03b6 when p \u00bc 1, it surprisingly extends until \u03b6 6=\u00f06\u2212d\u00de close to p c , signaling that the meanfield (ER) structure expands beyond the input characteristic link length \u03b6 near criticality. We named this phenomenon critical stretching, and we demonstrated its geometric and dynamic features by analyzing the Euclidean correlation length \u03be\u00f0p; \u03b6\u00de and its chemical counterpart \u03be l \u00f0p; \u03b6\u00de, whose crossover scales are summarized in Table I .",

(i) The critical stretching length scales \u03be \u00c3 and \u03be \u00c3 l are univocally defined by the critical exponents of percolation and the dimension of the embedding space. As such, they are not influenced by the system's finite size [35] and can be regarded as a set of universal spatiotemporal scales for any spatial network featuring a characteristic scale of link lengths and a homogeneous degree distribution. (ii) In light of the expressions in Table I , the stretching effects become stronger at higher embedding dimensions. In d \u00bc 3 networks, e.g., the intrinsic scales \u03be \u00c3 \u00bc \u03be \u00c3 l \u00bc \u03b6 2 at p c are significantly larger if compared to the crossover scales \u03be \u00d7 \u00bc \u03b6 and \u03be \u00d7 l \u221d log \u03b6 away from criticality. This supports the possibility that the stretching effects we found can be experimentally observed in real-world systems. In fact, besides accurately modeling communication [16] [17] [18] 21] and transport networks [19, 20] , recent evidences [23] [24] [25] [26] support the existence of scale-invariant organization principles in mammal brains based on the exponential wiring cost function examined here. Our results offer then a fundamental keystone for understanding, e.g., the traffic flow [13] or the neural functioning-e.g., in reference to the observed activity before epileptic seizures [38] -and ",
