            "text": "The gastrointestinal microbiota influences the health of the host, supports the immune system and provides competitive exclusion, which acts to enhance protection against intestinal pathogens (Falk et al., 1998, Hooper et al., 2001). Moreover, microorganisms and their ecology are important for most of the biochemical transformations in the environment. Dynamic interactions and overall composition of the microbial community in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans ultimately reflect the co-evolution or selection of microorganism with their host and the environments, and diets adopted by the host (Qu et al., 2008). Domestic cats are \u201cobligate carnivores,\u201d their diet is composed of primarily animal-based protein and supplemented by plant-based fibrous material diet. Unlike the case for other monogastric animals (e.g., rats, mice, pigs, and chickens), knowledge regarding the composition of the feline gastrointestinal microbiota is still very limited. Domestic cats are one of the most common companion animals and the close interactions between human and their cats are well known. Attention to the feline intestinal microbial community is important not only to animal health (Inness et al., 2007, Jergens, 2002, Johnston et al., 2001, Simpson, 1998) but also as a reservoir for potential zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacterial strains which could be opportunistic risks to human health (Leener et al., 2005, Moyaert et al., 2006). In addition, the distribution of certain bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. is of particular interest due to the usage of these bacteria as probiotics in veterinary medicine (Ritchie et al., 2010).",

From culture-independent 16S rRNA and cpn60 sequence analysis of pooled feline fecal samples, Firmicutes have been shown to be the most predominant bacterial group, followed by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria respectively (Desai et al., 2009, Ritchie et al., 2010, Ritchie et al., 2008). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the predominant microbial phyla in human gut as well (Eckburg et al., 2005, Gill et al., 2006), and a recent study also indicated a similar trend in dog fecal samples (Swanson et al., 2011). Similarly, Bacteroidetes were also highly represented in the metagenomes of chicken and turkey poult ceca (Qu et al., 2008, Scupham, 2007).",

            "text": "Besides the microbial diversity, association with beneficial microorganisms, enteric zoonotic agents in domestic cats are also a concern. Domestic cats in general are considered to pose only a small risk for carrying and transmitting enteric zoonotic agents, but cat owners are still at a higher risk for contracting zoonoses from their pets than individuals who do not reside with a companion animal (Angulo et al., 1994, Glaser et al., 1994). Due to the absence of more definitive risk estimations, some physicians recommend that immunosuppressive patients should not reside together with pets (Spencer, 1992). On the other hand, animal companionship offers psychological benefits particularly those who may be socially isolated because of illness e.g. people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Carmack, 1991, Siegel, 1990). Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium are potential enteric zoonosis pathogens in kittens because the consequences of human infection can be severe especially in immunocompromised individuals (Angulo and Swerdlow, 1995, Glaser et al., 1994). In addition, Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite causes clinician manifestations in cats and can also be transmitted to humans by different transmission routes causing serious effects on both human fetuses and immunocompromised patients (Dabritz and Conrad, 2008). The fecal shedding of aforementioned enteric zoonosis pathogens has been reported in kittens without showing any clinical signs (Spain et al., 2001). For these reasons, arguments on animal companionship for immunosuppressive patients continue. Therefore, enhancing our knowledge of the feline intestinal microbiome is important for both animal and human health. Although there were reports that the microbiota vary along the gastrointestinal tract (Ritchie et al., 2008, Suchodolski et al., 2005), fecal samples are readily available for clinical studies, and continued efforts to characterize the domestic feline fecal microbiota is ecologically important. To our knowledge, this study is the primary endeavor to provide a more comprehensive overview of the feline gastrointestinal metagenome using pyrosequencing.",

Sampled cats live in indoor home environments in different locations across Hong Kong and were fed with commercially available cat diets (Royal Canine Inc., St. Charles, MO, USA) for at least a year before sampling. The cats were clinically healthy with no history of antibiotic therapy 4 months prior to the sample collection. The age of cats ranged from 3 to 16 years (median of 8 years), while body condition scores ranged from 4 to 7 (median 5) on a 9-point scale. All were vaccinated against feline infectious diseases (feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia). Fresh fecal samples (within ~ 20 min of defecation) were collected aseptically and transported to the laboratory on dry ice, then stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until DNA extraction.",

Subsequently, 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA and 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was applied to each sample. 2 \u03bcl of RNase and 15 \u03bcl of proteinase K were also applied together with QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen GmBH, Hilden, Germany) for removal of RNA, protein, and purification. After extraction, quality and quantity of the DNAs were determined using a nanodrop (ND-2000) spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).

The overview of phylogenetic computations (based on assembled data) provided 97.78% bacteria, 1.23% Eukaryota, 0.9% Archaea and 0.09% Viruses. In this feline intestinal metagenome, the Bacteroides/Chlorobi group was the most predominant phylum ~ 68%, followed by Firmicutes ~ 13% and Proteobacteria ~ 6% (Table 1\n), and a similar trend was demonstrated by WebCARMA analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). Galaxy's taxonomy also provided the same pattern of phyla distribution (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our findings differ from those in recent studies involving 16S rRNA pyrosequencing (Handl et al., 2011) and gene clone library analysis of healthy feline fecal samples by universal bacterial primers. In these studies, Firmicutes were reported as the most abundant phylum (87.3%), followed by Proteobacteria (7.9%), Bacteroidetes (2.4%), Actinobacteria (2.3%), and Fusobacteria (0.2%) (Ritchie et al., 2010). Within Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, Bacteroidales were the most predominant including Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides fraglis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides ruminocola. Firmicutes were the second predominant phylum in feline gastrointestinal tract (Supplementary Fig. 1) with Clostridia being the primary contributor to the Firmicutes populations followed by Bacilli, Mollicutes and Lactobacillales. In comparison with previous 16S rRNA gene-based data (Ritchie et al., 2010), there were significantly lower percentages of Firmicutes in this feline intestinal metagenome. Reasons for variation are difficult to identify and not obvious, biases involved in selection of clones, sequencing depth and primer biases, etc., may contribute to this divergence. It also has been shown that different regions of 16S rRNA gene reveal different diversity, and therefore a certain region may serve well for profiling a certain spectrum of bacteria but not all. Comparison between 16S rRNA profiling and metagenomics profiling did not make sense, and ideally we could only do the comparison using only the 16S rRNA gene that cover the same region. Although microbial diversity analysis using 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing analysis is a more cost-effective method for microbiome characterization 16S rRNA gene based data, a shotgun metagenomics approach as used here is a more ideal approach to characterize the unbiased bacterial phyla diversity in feline gastrointestinal tract.",

The shotgun approach may able to detect the rare species when deeper metagenomic sequencing becomes available. On the other hand, shotgun metagenomic sequencing gives more precise information in species level of microbial community, when 16S rRNA sequencing often provides information on genus level.

Among these groups of archaea, the methanogenic archaea were the most predominant and diverse in the feline metagenome. Methanogenic archaea were also the most abundant group in dogs, human, mice and chicken (Kurokawa et al., 2007, Qu et al., 2008, Swanson et al., 2010, Turnbaugh et al., 2006). In the cat fecal Metagenome (CFM), Crenarchaeota were the lowest proportion of archaea, whereas they were more abundant in other metagenomes (Fig. 1\n). In the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, archaea are commensal organisms and have also been described in the intestine of monogastric hosts including human in which Methanobacteriales are the most common group (Eckburg et al., 2005). Although the diversity of archaea have been described in dogs previously (Swanson et al., 2010), the diversity of this domain in cats have not yet been elucidated. Despite archaea playing a commensal role in the intestine, the interaction with other microorganisms may also contribute to pathogenicity in humans. Methanogens have been associated with various pathologies in human such as periodontitis, endodontitis, colon cancer and diverticulosis (Conway de Macario and Macario, 2009). Therefore, it is also important for future efforts to further characterize the actual prevalence and clinical importance of archaea in cats.",

Recent viral metagenomics studies also showed the diversity of viruses in human gastrointestinal tract with several phylotypes (Breitbart et al., 2003). Domestic cats and dogs are the most common pets and live in close proximity to humans in daily life. Therefore, studies on the viral community in companion animals and the potential for cross-transmission between human and pets are needed. Due to the methodology (shotgun DNA pyrosequencing approach) the current study only allowed the evaluation of dsDNA viruses. In the future, surveillance of RNA and ssDNA viruses in cats should be performed in order to improve knowledge on diversity and ecology of intestinal viruses.",

Microbial secondary metabolites contain antibiotics, pigments, toxins, effectors of ecological competition and symbiosis, pheromones, enzyme inhibitors, immunomodulating agents, receptor antagonists and agonists, pesticides, antitumor agents and growth promoters of animals and plants. Such metabolites have a major effect on the health, nutrition and economics of our society (Demain, 1992). The factors contributing to these profiles are still uncertain but their formation is certainly affected by factors including nutrients, growth rate, feedback control, enzyme inactivation, and enzyme induction (Demain, 1998). The other two functional categories (dormancy and sporulation, and macromolecular synthesis) are also important in microbial growth and microbe\u2013microbe interactions (Dworkin and Shah, 2010). Our present results least abundant of dormancy and sporulation in feline gastrointestinal microbiota indicating that either most of the bacteria in fresh fecal sample are vegetative cells or the lack of a bead beating step in our DNA processing may have reduced the contribution of spore forming bacteria.

As noted previously it has been recommended by some physicians that immunosuppressive patients should not live with pets (Spencer, 1992), yet animal companionship also provides psychological benefits particularly for socially isolated patients (Carmack, 1991). The current gene-centric metagenomics study adds further understanding on the potential risks of domestic cats to human health. From our analysis, we identified 12 genera of enteric zoonotic bacteria composed of 41 species in the feline fecal microbiome (Table 3\n). Most of these organisms are primarily considered opportunistic foodborne pathogens which were in relatively low abundance (< 0.1%) in relation to the rest of the bacterial community. The identification of zoonotic pathogens showed that the abundance of enteric zoonotic bacteria in domestic cats certainly highlight the potential for transmission of opportunistic infections to human. Further study is needed to determine the prevalence and importance of such pathogens in more diverse cat populations.",

It is generally accepted that the increased use of antimicrobial agents led to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria and/or their resistant genes. In addition, several studies suggested a possible exchange of resistant organisms and/or their resistance genes between pet animals and humans (Guardabassi et al., 2004, Simjee et al., 2002). The current functional gene profiling also documents the existing antimicrobial resistance genes in feline gastrointestinal tract (Table 4\n). Multidrug resistance efflux pumps, fluroquinolones resistance and beta-lactamase are major predominant antimicrobial resistance genes. Previous studies also provided data on antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats (Moyaert et al., 2006). However, these cultural based studies relied on the resistance level of indicator bacteria. Our study provides further the molecular data on the antibiotic resistant genes present in feline gastrointestinal microbiota. Due to the presence of enteric zoonotic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in cat fecal materials, litter boxes certainly represent potential sources of infection between cats and humans. Although healthy individuals are at low risks of getting zoonotic infections from domestic cats, immunocompromised people may be of particular concern.",

HSM was defined as a human fecal sample from a malnourished person, while CCB was the cecum sample from Camphylobacter jejuni NCTC11168 challenged chicken. The comprehensive overviews of all nine data sets are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Clustering among those metagenomes was performed using unscaled Manhattan variance distances and presented by a double hierarchical dendogram. The clustering based comparisons were demonstrated at the phylogenetic level (Fig. 1) as well as the metabolic level (Fig. 2\n). Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that our cat sample clustered together with two chicken cecum metagenomes (CCA and CCB) and separated from other mammalian samples including dogs, humans and mice. The Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in all metagenomic samples. The heat map also demonstrated that Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria are more predominant in CFM rather than that of both CCA and CCB. Fungi and metazoa groups are also found to be predominated in CFM, CCA, CCB and HSM. Non-metric MDS plot illustrated that the similarity among CFM, CCA and CCB as well as among F1S, K9C, K9BP and LMC are more than 80%, whereas all metagenomics data have maximum of 60\u201380% similarity at the phylogenetic level (Fig. 3A). The clustering of cat metagenome with that of chicken may be due to similar bacterial diversity influenced by similar dietary components.

According to the similarity and distances based clustering among nine metagenomics data sets from five different hosts, feline metagenome clustered closely together with chicken at the phylogenetic contribution (> 80% relative similarity), and at the metabolic level, all metagenomes were clustered together (> 80%) except CCB which presented a notable out group. Our feline fecal metagenomics study also demonstrated the diverse species of enteric zoonotic pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistant genes in cat feces. Together, these data will serve to improve our understanding of potential public health risks from companion cats.
