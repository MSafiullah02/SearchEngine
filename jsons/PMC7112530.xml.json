            "text": "Bats, Chiropteras, are well-known vectors of rabies and some studies indicate that they may also naturally harbor some emerging viruses such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, bat-SARS-CoV and Ebola virus (Chua et al., 2002, Halpin et al., 2000, Lau et al., 2005, Leroy et al., 2005, Mayen, 2003, McColl et al., 2000, Normile, 2005). Bat has two suborders, Megachiroptera (flying fox) and Microchiroptera (insectivorous bat). Many emerging or re-emerging viruses, such as rabies, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus, were isolated form Megachiroptera. In particular, European bat lyssavirus type I was also isolated from Rousettus sp. (Van der Poel et al., 2000, Wellenberg et al., 2002, Wong et al., 2007). Bats were thought to have an important role for the infection cycle of these emerging and re-emerging viruses. In vivo experiment, Ebola virus inoculation studies showed that both flying foxes and insectivorous bats support viral replication and circulation with high viral titers without becoming ill (Swanepoel et al., 1996). Studies in vitro have shown that Ebola virus VP35 protein blocks the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and Ebola virus VP24 protein inhibits interferon (IFN) signaling (Basler et al., 2003, Reid et al., 2006). These data suggested that Ebola virus might evade the anti-viral activity of IFNs in bat cells. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate IFN regulation and function in bats because few immunological studies have been reported for this animal species.",

            "text": "Cells have many responses to viral infection. One of the responses is the secretion of type I IFNs which are composed of multiple \u03b1 subtypes and a single \u03b2 subtype (Sen, 2001). Type I IFNs expression utilize two signal transduction pathways; the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent pathway and TLR-independent pathway. In TLR-dependent pathway, cells recognize viral double-strand RNA, single-strand RNA and CpG DNA via TLR, and subsequently IFN-\u03b2 is induced. In TLR-independent pathway, intracellular sensors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (mda-5) detect viral components in the cytoplasm, and transactivate IFN-\u03b2 mRNA (Hiscott et al., 2006). Expressed IFN-\u03b2 binds to the type I IFN receptors and activates numerous IFN-stimulated genes, such as the protein kinase R (PKR) gene, the 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) gene, and the myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene. The product of these genes controls viral infection (Samuel, 2001). Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a viral intermediate in the proliferation of many RNA viruses, is known as an IFN-inducer through these sensors (Gitlin et al., 2006). Polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a synthetic mimetic of viral dsRNA and a strong inducer of type I IFNs in vivo and in vitro via these sensors (Hertzog et al., 2003).",

The PCR products were isolated by electrophoresis in an 1% agarose gel and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The purified PCR products were cloned into pCR-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the sequence was determined using the Big Dye\u2122 Terminator kit (ABI, CA, USA) and ABI PRISM\u2122 377 DNA Sequencer (ABI, CA, USA).

The full-length bat IFN-\u03b1 ORF was 562 bp and encoded 187-aa polypeptides. Bat IFN-\u03b2 ORF was 558 bp and encoded 186-aa polypeptides (Fig. 1(A and B)). Direct comparison of bat IFN-\u03b1 genes simultaneously against various animal species was complicated by the fact that there are various IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and difficulties in the identification of subtype of the bat IFN-\u03b1. Therefore, sequence comparisons were performed using IFN-\u03b2 between bat and human, pig, cat, horse, and mouse. The identity of bat IFN-\u03b2 with human, pig, cat, horse, and mouse IFN-\u03b2 were 77.5, 82.0, 78.3, 77.5, and 66.5% at the nucleotide level and 64.2, 72.0, 61.8, 61.3, and 49.5% at the amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid sequences from several representative eutherian type I IFNs and chicken type I IFN found that both bat IFN-\u03b1 and bat IFN-\u03b2 are homologous to the mammalian IFN group. Further analysis showed that both bat IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were most closely related to those of pig, and followed by horse (Fig. 2\n). Although phylogenetic relationship between bat and other animals remains inconclusive, molecular phylogenetics using mitochondrial DNA or retro-transposon insertions indicated that Chiroptera is included in Fereuungrate or Pegasoferae (Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Pholidota, and Chiroptera) (Nikaido et al., 2000, Nishihara et al., 2006). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the cell surface molecule CD4 showed that bat is more closely related to cat and dog (Omatsu et al., 2006). Our findings and these molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested that bat might have anti-viral mechanism similar to these animals. Some investigators indicated that Nipah virus spread from Megachiroptera to pig and then from pig to human (Tan and Wong, 2003), and pig might be more susceptible to the virus than other animals. In contrast, relatively low homology of immune factors between bat and human suggested the presence of different anti-viral activity against some viral infections. These factors might be one of the key factors to control zoonoses from bat.",

In BPKCs, there is an increase in the expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, but not IFN-\u03b1 mRNA, at 3 h after poly(I:C) treatment. However, in Tb-1 Lu cells, poly(I:C) treatment induced IFN-\u03b1 mRNA production but production of INF-\u03b2 mRNA was not observed (Fig. 3(A)). To examine whether BPKCs or Tb-1 Lu expresses type I IFN mRNA in response to the bat IFN-containing medium (exogenous IFN), the expression of type I IFNs mRNA was examined at 0, 4, and 8 h after the exogenous IFN-treatment. In the case of BPKCs, IFN-\u03b1 mRNA was detected at each time point with a gradual increase, and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA which was not initially detected, peaked at 4 h in response to exogenous IFN (Fig. 3(B)). In Tb-1 Lu, however, type I IFNs mRNA expression was not detected at all (data not shown). Although BPKCs could induce type I IFNs mRNA in response to poly(I:C) via TLR3, RIG-I, and mda-5, type I IFNs-inducing signal was not sufficient for the stimulation of IFN-\u03b1 mRNA synthesis. In contrast, when type I IFNs were supplied to BPKCs, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was induced more rapidly than IFN-\u03b1. This indicated that IFN-\u03b2 is involved in immediate response to invasion of viruses or microbes and IFN-\u03b1, which is responsible for anti-viral activity via stimulation of PKR, OAS, and Mx synthesis, is induced by IFN-\u03b2 and has more prolonged response in BPKCs (Fig. 3(B)). When Tb-1 Lu were treated with either poly(I:C) or bat IFNs-containing medium, these cells did not express any IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 mRNA. This suggests that in Tb-1 Lu the mechanism of dsRNA recognition or the signaling pathway reacted to exogenous IFNs is not utilized for up-regulation of type I IFNs mRNA. Thus, the IFN signal responding to both poly(I:C) and exogenous type I IFNs was different between BPKCs and Tb-1 Lu. Bat is diversified into about a thousand species in the world. These results further indicated that extra considerations should be taken in the interpretation of experimental data of anti-viral dynamics among various bat cell types and species.",

However, these studies are complicated because few studies on anti-viral mechanism of bat are available. Thus, the nucleotide sequences of type I IFNs of Rousette bat were characterized for the first time. To investigate whether and how bats harbor clinically important pathogens, some basic information from inoculation studies performed in vivo and in vitro is very important. To determine how wild animals remain asymptomatic to pathogens, it will be necessary to understand their viral control mechanisms, such as IFN signaling. Using bats as representative pathogenic carriers, this study provides some basic and important immunological information about bat. It is necessary for understanding zoonoses from bat, especially for Megachiroptera.",
