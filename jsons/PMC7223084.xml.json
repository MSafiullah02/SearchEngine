As a new type of natural confinement structure, VLPs are often employed to encapsulate some external guest molecules (e.g. polymers, nanoparticles and proteins) to construct functionalized nanocages for drug delivery, biosensing and especially catalysis [26\u201330].

This issue could be addressed by immobilizing VLPs on solid supports such as silica [31], thereafter serving as heterogeneous catalysts for the reactions. At present, protein immobilization process often involves two steps including surface modifications (e.g. amine functionalization) on solid supports and further covalent combinations of proteins to them via amide, ester or ether linkages [32, 33]. Obviously, this process is fussy and environment-unfriendly due to the use of toxic organic solvents and coupling agents.",

The preparation procedures of Pd colloids with other ligands including CTAB, SDS and PVP were similar to that of Tween 80. In the procedure, the molar ratio of Pd to ligand was kept fixed at 20:1 (mol:mol). The size distribution of Pd colloidal NPs was measured here to investigate the effects of ligands on maintaining the stability of synthesized Pd NPs. The best ligand among four ones was selected to further optimize Pd colloid preparation via varying the molar ratio of Pd to this ligand.",

The result was compared to that of non-confined Pd colloidal NPs. The tests were conducted in a 96-well plate at room temperature. Specifically, 30 \u00b5L of 4-NP aqueous solution (0.4\u20134.0 mM) and 30 \u00b5L of Pd@VP2 aqueous solution and 110 \u00b5L of deionized water were fully mixed in the well of the plate. The reaction began once 30 \u00b5L of 0.1 mol/L KBH4 aqueous solution was added to the mixed solution. The final concentration of Pd was controlled to 2\u20138 \u03bcM. Results were monitored on line by microplate reader (Spark 10 M, Tecan, Switzerland) from the wavelength of 200 nm to 450 nm. Reactions were ended when there was no absorption change. Non-confined Pd colloidal NPs were employed as the control. 4-NP and 4-AP have the maximal adsorptions at the wavelengths of 320, and 296 nm, respectively. Noted that, 4-NP solution without NaBH4 has a maximal adsorption at the wavelength of 320 nm, while it is ionized by the addition of excess amount of NaBH4 and its maximal absorption wavelength transfers from 320 to 400 nm (Fig. S1 in supplementary information, SI). 4-NP reduction will not proceed until the addition of the catalyst. The adsorption at the wavelength of 296 nm representing 4-AP was not observed in the blank test even after 17 min (Fig. S1), proving this opinion. Hence, the conversion of 4-NP (X) in the reaction was estimated by the decline of adsorption intensity at the wavelength of 400 nm using Eq. 2.2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$X = \\frac{{A_{NP}^{0} - A_{NP} }}{{A_{NP}^{0} }} \\times 100\\%$$\\end{document}X=ANP0-ANPANP0\u00d7100%where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$A_{NP}^{0}$$\\end{document}ANP0 and ANP are the initial adsorption of 4-NP and the instant one during the reaction at \u03bb400 nm, respectively.",

Obviously, the order of stabilizers for efficiently controlling the particle size of Pd NPs was Tween 80 > SDS > PVP > CTAB. Tween 80, the best stabilizer among four ones, for example, had the size distribution in the range of 10\u20131000 nm in aqueous medium and its mean size was calculated to be about 37.26 nm (Fig. S2c, SI). In comparison, Pd-CTAB had the size distribution mainly in the range of 60\u20131000 nm with the mean size at 233.2 nm. Results closely related to the properties of stabilizers. CTAB, a cationic surfactant, is hard to adsorb on electrophilic Pd NPs surfaces. Hence, it is unfavorable to the stability of Pd NPs (Zeta potential only \u2212 0.21 mV). However, SDS, an anionic one, is opposite to CTAB. Electrostatic stabilization occurs in this case by adsorbing SDS molecules on the surface of Pd NPs, resulting in coulombic repulsion between the nanoparticles [41]. Apparently, it helps the stability of Pd NPs (Zeta potential \u2212 13.5 mV). In addition, Tween 80 and PVP, both nonionic stabilizers, achieve steric stabilization by a protective barrier composed of large molecules. They can chemically bond with some part of Pd surface as well as physically occupy the interspace between Pd NPs, preventing direct contact between them [42]. Actually, Tween 80 stabilized Pd NPs possessed the smallest mean size and the best stability (Zeta potential -22.3 mV) as well in this work. Compared to Pd-Tween80, Pd-PVP had the larger mean particle size, very possibly attributing to the polymer with a long chain surrounding individual Pd NPs. Also, negatively charged Pd-Tween80 favors the encapsulation of it into VLP via self-assembly due to its strong interaction with cationic VP2 capsid proteins. In summary, Tween 80 was selected to stabilize Pd NPs in the following studies.",

For instance, when the molar ratio of Pd to Tween 80 declined from 1:0.015 to 1:0.1, the corresponding mean size of Pd colloidal NPs greatly decreased from 160 to 16 nm. However, if the molar ratio of Pd to Tween 80 continued descending, its mean size rose up. It was reasonably attributed to the formation of micelles with large sizes that were composed of excessive surfactant molecules in liquid phase. Hence, the optimal molar ratio of the Pd to Tween 80 was 1:0.1 in this work.

The efficiency of Pd@VP2 immobilization was determined via adsorption change of Pd@VP2 in aqueous solution before and after immobilization on GO at the wavelength of 280 nm (\u03bb280 nm), the maximum absorption wavelength of proteins.

TEM image of Pd@VP2 after four runs (Fig. 5c) exhibited the similar appearance to that before reaction (Fig. 5b). It proved the strong anchoring effects of GO on Pd@VP2, in accordance with XPS analysis. The average size of Pd NPs in Pd@VP2 was measured to be 7.89 \u00b1 0.56 nm (inner graph of Fig. 5c), keeping unchanged in comparison to that before reaction (7.72 \u00b1 0.14 nm, inner graph of Fig. 5b). It hinted the high stability of Ru NPs with the protection of protein nanocages. Zeta potential of Pd@VP2/GO after four runs was measured to be -36.1 \u00b1 9.8 mV (Fig. S8b), slightly less than that before reaction (\u2212 38.7 \u00b1 9.77 mV, Fig. S8a), possibly owing to the adsorption of a small amount of salt cations on GO surface. Results exhibited the strong electrostatic repulsions among Pd@VP2/GO particles. It favored the dispersion of them in aqueous solution, maintaining the high catalytic activity even after several runs. Additionally, Pd@VP2/GO particles after four runs possessed the mean size of 712.4 nm (Fig. S9b), similar to that before reaction (693.3 \u00b1 33.54 nm, Fig. S9a). It proved the stability of as-prepared Pd@VP2/GO, indicating its reusable potential in catalysis.",

            "text": "In summary, we synthesized a confined nanoreactor by encapsulating Tween 80 stabilized Pd nanoparticles into rotavirus VP2 VLPs (i.e. Pd@VP2). In comparison to non-confined Pd-Tween80, Pd@VP2 exhibited an enhanced activity in the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP thanks to the confinement effects including the high dispersion of Pd NPs and high effective concentration of substrates in confined space. Furthermore, Pd@VP2 was immobilized on GO sheets (i.e. Pd@VP2/GO) via a simple mixing method. It showed a slight decline on catalytic activity across four runs, hinting the stable and reusable capability of Pd@VP2/GO. This work potentially created a facile and environment-friendly route to construct an immobilized catalytic nanoreactor based on viral protein cages with the cheerful prospects in sustainable and green chemistry.",
