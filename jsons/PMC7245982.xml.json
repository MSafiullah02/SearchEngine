In this sense, the adolescents\u2019 tendency, more in males than females, to a certain underestimation of the danger was confirmed. In this respect, they reported that they are less anxious than their parents (Table 2). The adolescents, as are approaching adulthood, the apprehension increased, and young people were more realistic by sharing more of the same fears as family adults (Table 3) [3]. Two interesting trends appeared. The first is that the level of concern, recorded after the first four days of detection, increased significantly (from the fourth to the eighth day), but then it remained constant (Table 4). After an initial understandable increase (which coincided largely with the entry into force of the restrictions throughout the country), the new situation was metabolized, returning to a sort of \u201cnormality.\u201d The second interesting result was that the concern expressed by adolescents (residing in the central-southern regions, and less involved in the diffusion of the phenomenon) was double that of their peers from the northern regions (Table 5). This outcome probably depended on the fact that in the north, the emergency was already being experienced in full. However, in the rest of the country, much less affected by the epidemic, the unknown for an indeterminate future generated greater fear. In other words, individual and collective reactions to COVID-19 could be explained by the fear of the unknown. The representation of unknown danger, of which there is no awareness but which is seen as probably imminent, triggered a superior emotional reaction compared to those who have the possibility, or even the illusion, to better control an adverse situation for the simple fact to be in direct contact with it. Even if everyone agreed that the emergency would last for months (Table 6) [4].\n",

Wide distrust, however, was experienced towards information coming from social networks for its inaccuracy, if not for its total unreliability (Table 8). However, the level of discussion in the family remained very high (four-fifths of young people often talk about it with their parents), the medium with friends (half speaks often) and low that with teachers (less than a quarter). However, while in the case of parents and teachers this level remains constant over time, the discussion with friends decreases considerably, almost halving, passing from the first days of survey (9\u201312 March) to the last (17\u201320 March) as saying that the interest of the topic in peer discussions is reduced and left space to other issues (Tables 9, 10, 11).

It was what emerged from the last area investigated, such as concerning the repercussions on everyday life and relationships caused by the provisions of the authorities and the consequent restriction of individual freedom. Of course, great help came both from the school that organized itself to continue the lessons online and from the social platforms. The importance of having continued online schooling went beyond what can be didactically effective, but it was linked to the social function that school plays for adolescents [5]. Furthermore, being able, through this device, to reconstruct a sort of daily \u201cagenda\u201d was certainly helping the overall balance of the children. \u201cIt is not all the same as before,\u201d said the teenagers, \u201cwe meet less,\u201d but \u201cwe communicate more through social networks.\u201d Fewer written or vocal messages, but many video calls, to finally recover the pleasure of dialogue and, above all, to continue seeing each other (Table 15). The males seemed to suffer most from the situation. Over a quarter of the male champion complained that he had contracted his social relationships with friends, while less than a fifth of the girls say the same thing.
