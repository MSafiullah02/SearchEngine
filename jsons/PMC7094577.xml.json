The PIC window was subsequently proven useful in replacing intubation with sequential noninvasive ventilation in a nationwide multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial.78 Another multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that early use of NIPPV in acute exacerbation of COPD could alleviate respiratory muscle fatigue and prevent worsening of respiratory failure.79 Application of NIPPV was also shown to be beneficial in severe hypercapnic encephalopathy80 and for acute lung injury.81 A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample size is being conducted in China to assess the benefit of NIPPV use in patients with acute lung injury.",
