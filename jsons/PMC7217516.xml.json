            "text": "Modeling the spreading of infectious diseases has a long history [1\u20137]. Mathematical models not only deepen the understanding of epidemic dynamics, but also shed light on the control of diseases. In recent years, much attention has been paid to epidemic control via social relationship adjustment [8\u201310]. As a pioneering work, Gross et al. proposed a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on an adaptive network. Therein the susceptible individual breaks the link with the infected partner and rewire to another randomly selected susceptible individual [11]. This rewiring rule brings in highly complex dynamics (such as bistability and oscillation) to the classical SIS model. The rewiring dynamics then opens up the avenue on how individualized partnership adjustment alters the epidemic dynamics. On the one hand, besides the SIS model, typical epidemic models have almost been investigated including the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model [12], the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [13], and the susceptible-infected-vaccinated (SIV) model [14]. On the other hand, more realistic and complex link-rewiring rules are proposed. In particular, generalizations of Gross et al.'s rewiring rule are mainly twofold. For one thing, after the disconnection of susceptible-infected (SI) link, the susceptible is assumed to reconnect to a randomly selected member of the population whether it is susceptible or not [15]. For another, the infected is also allowed to switch its partnership from the susceptible to a new randomly selected contact [16]. Besides the rewiring rule which is dependent on the infection process, the rewiring rule that is independent of the infection process was also investigated [17,18]. In spite of different model assumptions, all these models showed that the infection propagation can be greatly influenced by the dynamical networks. In particular, the infection can be effectively suppressed by reducing the interaction opportunities between susceptible and infected individuals.",

            "text": "Besides the above-mentioned link-rewiring models, another type of adaptive network is the link-activation-deactivation model [19\u201321]. It assumes that a link can either be broken or recreated on the basis of the infectious states of the two end points of the link. In this model, only local information is required, which could be more realistic [10]. In particular, Guo et al. proposed an ASIS model, in which any SI link can be broken (deactivated). After the disconnection of an SI link, the two disconnected nodes can be reconnected again once both of them become susceptible (activated) [21]. Despite seeming differences, the link-activation-deactivation dynamics is similar to the rewiring dynamics. On the one hand, Guo et al. showed that the ASIS model (initiated on complete graphs) approximates the link-rewiring model [11]. On the other hand, the quasistationary (metastable) fraction of infected individuals can be reduced by increasing the effective breaking rate (proportional to the ratio of deactivating rate to activating rate). This echoes the results based on the link-rewiring models that the disease can be controlled by reducing the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. Therefore, both types of linking dynamics in epidemic control can be seen as decreasing the interaction rate between susceptible and infected individuals (called SI control). Furthermore, considering that the effective breaking rate in [21] also depends on the activating rate between susceptibles, their work reminds us of the significance of susceptible-susceptible (SS) links in epidemic control.",

Yet it is seldom addressed, compared to the SI control that has been intensively studied in previous literatures. It seems that these two control strategies are two sides of the same coin. Actually, this is true in Gross et al.'s model [11], since, based on their rewiring rule, the decrease of SI links directly leads to the increase of SS links. However, this is no longer valid in Risau-Gusm\u00e1n and Zanette's model [16], since the disconnection of an SI link does not necessarily result in the reconnection of an SS link. Therefore, the SS and SI control strategies are not equivalent in general.",

Unlike the models only allowing the breaking of SI links, we allow all three types of links [SS, SI, and infected-infected (II)] to be broken, equipped with three independent parameters to characterize the breaking rates of SS, SI, and II links. Actually, this assumption mimics the intrinsic nature of human mobility [22,23], namely, people moving or changing their social relationships due to a variety of reasons, even without the consideration of avoiding infectious diseases. In this way, SI links should not be the only type that is allowed to be broken; both SS and II links can change. For example, in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) not only are the susceptible individuals willing to avoid contact from the infected individuals, but the susceptible-susceptible and infected-infected relationships may also be broken up due to unsatisfactory sexual experiences; i.e., the rewiring processes can happen in SS and II links. Besides, we allow all the individuals to be capable of adjusting any of their partners. This mirrors the freedom of social life. It also excludes the central control of epidemics, for example, via organizations. In this way, we could concentrate on how the social partnership adjustment strategies alone alter the fate of epidemics.",

It is shown that sometimes the SS control is more effective and robust than the SI control. In particular, strengthening the closeness between susceptibles (SS control) effectively eradicates the disease no matter how infectious the disease is. However, the effectiveness of the SI control sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the intrinsic mobility rate of the population. In other words, there are cases such that the SI control cannot eliminate the disease as efficiently as the SS control. Simulation results are also shown for validating our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that, besides the SI control, it is still of concern that the SS control may serve as a better candidate for epidemic control.",

To characterize the fragilities of different types of links, we define wXY (XY\u2208{SS,SI,II}) as the probability with which an XY link breaks off in the process of disconnection. In each rewiring step, a link XY is selected randomly from the network. With probability wXY, the link is broken; otherwise, the link remains connected. If it is broken, X or Y is picked as the active individual, who is entitled to reform a new link. Its new neighbor is randomly selected from the individuals who are not in its current neighborhood.

This happens only when SI is broken off and S is selected to reform a new link to another susceptible individual.

This is already true in static networks, and it becomes even more difficult taking into account the dynamical nature of social networks [8]. Here we overcome this problem by assuming the adiabatic elimination of fast linking dynamics [27] (also called annealed adaptive dynamics [10]); i.e., the adjustment of social ties is much more frequent than the update of infection states. This assumption implies time scale separation of the two coupled dynamics. In other words, the disease is unlikely to spread until the social configuration tends to the stationary regime. In this way, NSI is approximated as\n(4)NSI\u2248Nk2\u03c0SI,where Nk/2 is the total number of the links in the network and \u03c0SI is the fraction of SI links in the stationary regime. This approximation greatly reduces the complexity of the coupled dynamics. In light of this, the idea of time scale separation has frequently been used in analyzing complex dynamics on adaptive networks (epidemics [18,19,31] and evolutionary games [24,32]).",

In fact, this bistable case bears two internal equilibria lying at x1* (unstable) and x2* (stable) (x1*<x2*). For a small initial fraction of infected individuals, the deterministic part of the system drives the infection to extinction based on the analytical investigation. Yet by its intrinsic stochastic nature of the epidemic spreading, the infection would increase in number and be possibly trapped around the stable equilibria from time to time. Even though it is a type of rare event, it takes quite long to escape from this trap. Thus on average it results in a relatively higher level of final fraction of infected individuals given the running time of simulations (here 106 generations).

For strong infectious disease, however, it is more efficient to adopt the SS control than the SI control. This result is counterintuitive. Intuitively, reducing the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals is believed to suppress the disease propagation. Moreover, it seems that decreasing the interaction rate of SI links could naturally result in the increase of SS links [37]. How can these two strategies perform so differently? One of the salient features of our model is the variability of II links, which has seldom been addressed previously. Actually, increasing wSI is equivalent to decreasing both wSS and wII. In other words, the SI control is equivalent to simultaneously strengthening SS links and II links. Similarly, the SS control is equivalent to simultaneously reducing the closeness of SI links and II links. Thus, the relation of the SI and SS control strategies is not as straightforward as expected. To illustrate the impact of II links on the epidemic dynamics, we consider two examples: (1) wSI=0.98, wSS=0.2, and wII=0.2, and (2) wSI=0.98, wSS=0.2, and wII=0.98. The only difference between these two examples is the value of wII. It is easy to show that in example 1 the disease becomes extinct, whereas bistability arises in example 2 [based on Eq. (10)].",

Compared to the selective rule in [11], individuals in our model do not necessarily know who gets infected currently, which is more realistic. Actually, the nonselective rule increases the exposure of the susceptible individuals to the infected individuals. This is very likely in the beginning of an epidemic season, where the information on infection status is unaccessible. In particular, even though the SI control increases the breaking possibility of each SI link, a new SI link may be generated again due to the nonselective rule. By contrast, the SS control makes a straightforward intervention during the process of disconnection. That is, by strengthening the closeness between susceptible individuals, the SS strategy reduces the possibility of SI connection effectively. In this way, the nonselective rule has a relatively small impact on the SS control. Therefore, in the framework of the nonselective rewiring rule, the SS strategy is more efficient than the SI strategy.",

It is not necessarily realistic for individuals who break up a relationship to have a new partner immediately.
