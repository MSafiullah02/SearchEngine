We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 key informants at two time points to understand organizational readiness, facilitators, and barriers to change. We identified strategies important to successful implementation, particularly in the context of change fatigue. Purpose Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) is effective for secondary fracture prevention. Two hospital sites implemented FLS for hip fracture patients, 50 + years, in Alberta, Canada. We assessed organizational readiness, facilitators, and barriers to change to better understand the context in which the FLS was implemented to inform its potential spread provincially. Methods We recruited individuals involved in FLS implementation at provincial and site levels to participate in telephone interviews at baseline and 16 months post-implementation. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis. In addition, site-level participants were invited to complete the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change tool at baseline. Results We conducted 33 semi-structured interviews (20 at baseline; 13 at post-implementation) with 21 key informants. Participants included managers (24%), FLS physicians/clinical nurses (19%), operational/leadership roles (19%), physicians/ surgeons (14%), pharmacists (10%), nurse practitioners (10%), and social work (5%). Seventeen site-level participants completed the ORIC tool at baseline; all participants scored high (71%) or neutral (29%). We found that the use of several strategies, including demonstrating value, providing resources, and selecting appropriate sites, were important to implementation, particularly in the context of change fatigue. Participants perceived the FLS as acceptable and there was evidence of facilitated learning rather than simply monitoring implementation as intended.",

            "text": "Osteoporosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. [1, 2] Osteoporosis care reduces risk of future fractures by about 50%. [3, 4] Regardless, fewer than 20% of adults, 50 years of age and older, are tested or treated for osteoporosis after a lowtrauma fragility fracture [3, 4] generating a substantial and unwarranted \"care gap.\" Fracture liaison services (FLS) are an evidence-based and effective approach to secondary fracture prevention utilizing a 3i approach to secondary fracture prevention (i.e., Identify those at risk, Investigate using bone mineral density tests, and Initiate appropriate treatment when needed). [5] [6] [7] The FLS model has been found effective for secondary fracture prevention in Canada and internationally [7, 8] . Despite promotion of FLS with a best practice framework by the International Osteoporosis Foundation [6, 9] and advocacy by Osteoporosis Canada [7] , implementation of a coordinator-based post-fracture model of care is not without barriers. Implementing change can be difficult. Implementation outcomes serve as indicators of implementation success and, when implementation is successful, are the effects of purposeful and deliberate actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services [10] . When a newly implemented healthcare innovation fails to achieve the expected benefits, it is often attributable to ineffective implementation rather than issue with the innovation itself [11] . Challenges can emerge from individual and organizational factors and obstacles in the local environment [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, understanding the context in which implementation occurs can shed light on the implementation outcomes.",

In brief, the FLS identified patients age 50 or older with a hip fracture within the hospital setting, commenced appropriate osteoporosis care, bridged the acute-topost-acute period and the return to pre-fracture living environment, and, finally, transitioned care back to the family physician. The FLS utilized the expertise and continuity of clinical nurses and a physician at each site to serve as a common source of information and connection to the healthcare system, with the clinical nurses following patients for 1-year following the hip fracture. In advance of broader service rollout, we assessed the 2 early adopter sites to understand the context in which the FLS was implemented, including readiness to implement change as well as facilitators and barriers to implementation, to inform its potential spread provincially (Fig. 1 ).",

The qualitative design allowed us to elicit and understand the experience and perceptions of individuals directly involved in FLS implementation and service delivery.",

Potential key informants were identified in collaboration with the Fragility and Stability Program Manager and the Unit Managers at each site, who also sent an introductory email about the study. Interested participants contacted the research team by telephone or email with questions and to arrange participation. Participants were invited to participate in telephone interviews at 2 time points: at baseline during the initial implementation phase and at approximately 16 months postimplementation. In addition, participants were asked to identify other individuals with knowledge of the FLS; newly identified individuals were invited to participate in the study using the same strategy outlined above. Lastly, individuals at the site level who participated in baseline interviews were invited to complete the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) tool [13] . ORIC is a 10-item tool which measures readiness for change on a 5-point Likert scale and includes the sub-domains of change commitment and change efficacy. Participants received the ORIC questionnaire by email following their baseline interview, with instructions to complete and return the questionnaire.",

The research team held regular meetings to review code definitions, emerging concepts, and memos and discussed discrepancies to reach consensus. We conducted data collection and analysis until thematic (and role) saturation was achieved [18] as was appropriate based on the design and objective of the study [19] . Qualitative data were managed and analyzed using ATLAS.ti Version 7 [20] . Descriptive statistics were conducted for the ORIC questionnaire, with data entered and managed using SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 25 [21] . Total and sub-scale scores were calculated by the sum across items. Guided by the questionnaire response scale anchors, we categorized participant scores as low (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) , neutral (30-39), or high (40-50), with higher scores representing more favorable Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change through the FLS. We implemented several strategies throughout the research process to ensure rigor including methodological coherence [22] , peer debriefing [23] , and maintaining an audit trail [23] . In addition, we synthesized and presented the findings using thematic statements, which is a strategy to make findings clear and actionable. [24] Results In total, we conducted 33 semi-structured telephone interviews with 21 key informants at the 2 time points. We conducted 20 baseline interviews between July 2015 and January 2016, and 13 post-implementation interviews between October 2016 and March 2017. Participants represented a variety of roles, including managers (24%), FLS team members (i.e., physicians and nurses) (19%), those in leadership or operational roles (19%), physicians or surgeons (14%), pharmacists (10%), nurse practitioners (10%), and social work (5%). Of those who participated in a baseline interview, 18 were invited to complete the ORIC, 17 of which returned the questionnaire. Two participants were not eligible to complete a questionnaire due to their role or because they did not participate at baseline and 1 participant was unresponsive. All 17 participants who completed the questionnaire scored their organization's readiness to implement change as high or neutral. There was no difference in ORIC scores between the two sites (t (15) = \u2212 0.62, p = 0.54). We provide a summary of the participant characteristics and ORIC scores in Tables 1 and 2. Three major themes emerged. First, the FLS was implemented using several strategies that were essential to implementation success, particularly in the context of change fatigue. Second, participants perceived the FLS as acceptable in meeting the needs of this patient population. Third, there was clear evidence of facilitated learning that went beyond monitoring implementation of the FLS as intended. We detail each thematic statement below. We provide a list of codes, sub-codes, and additional quotes for each statement in Table 2 . For all quotes, we included the study ID number for each participant.",

For example, participants described the people or sites involved as \"early adopters\" or as having a culture open to change.

            "text": "In AHS, we are used to change so I don't think it would have much of an influence. I think people would be accepting of a new service like FLS (Site 2, Participant 4). ORIC scores were calculated as the sum of 10 questions scored on a 5-pt Likert scale (where 1 = disagree and 5 = agree), for a maximum score of 50 The FLS is part of the Bone and Joint Health Strategic Clinical Network and it's also the Bone and Joint Network signature project and the FLS falls under that. So we have had good support from a leadership perspective across the province and I think that will continue because it has been made a priority (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 1). I think across the board everyone realized that osteoporosis is a big and costly issue for both patients and the system (Site 2, Participant 8). I think even from a higher level it's having the FLS and osteoporosis care identified as a care gap by the AHS was what really started all of this. And having them focus on osteoporosis care and providing their funding to run the program like this and continue to fund it in the future if there is benefit to the program is more important than the local factors at the PLC (Site 2, Participant 3). The Bone and Joint SCN have gone to them [beta hospital] and asked them to become the center of excellence in orthopedic care in this area so that in itself, you know, when somebody sets it as a priority area, it becomes a facilitator (Site 1, Participant 8). Providing resources so as not to increase workload of others I do not think that the FLS is adding on to anyone else's workload. If anything I think it's helping other people's work load so I think that's a key thing with this initiative, we are not piling anything onto anyone else (Site 1, Participant 1). It's someone else's job and it's not being added to the plate to the current staff (Site 1, Participant 4). It's when changes occur that creates more work for them that they do not see value in it (Site 1, Participant 9). I think the one thing is that it does not add work load to other people and so it in fact does not impact other people at all. So that's helpful in that it's not yet one more thing someone has to do or learn or whatever (Site 2, Participant 5). It's a fairly non-invasive program. It's not one that demands a lot of buy in or extra work from the staff on the ground level (Site 2, Participant 8). We've been very mindful of anything that we have put in cannot add additional workloads to them (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 1 And then in respect to communications with transitions, the FLS does provide communications to the family physicians which I would think that they would appreciate it. I think sometimes they are surprised to hear that their patient has been in the hospital with a hip fracture, that they find out months later and then are kind of left wondering what to do. And here we are sending them a letter saying, \"your patient has had a hip fracture and this is some of the things that we have done.",

            "text": "We've started this medication; we are doing these investigations\", to help them out because they may not often be comfortable with orthopedic care or osteoporosis management (Site 1, Participant 1). When they were sent back to their community living arrangement there was a plan of care for the primary care provider to understand what the therapy was to continue on in their future (Site 2, Participant 2). The care that is provided to the patients will be passed on to their primary care physician to ensure seamless care and treatment of patients with osteoporosis (Site 2, Participant 4). Whatever we do initially whether that's starting therapy in hospital or sending patients home with a prescription\u2026we send a letter to their GP [general practitioner] and then also at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. We'll also send another letter to their GP and just let them know what we have done and the plan is that at 3 months we'll do a Vit D level as well as a bone mineral density test if they have not had one in the last couple of years. And those two a copy of those will go to their GP (Site 2, Participant 5). We've done a year of this focused work of getting [patients] on the right trajectory. Now we do a hand off to primary care saying this patient now has a detailed care plan. It's really now under primary care accountability to manage that chronic disease and manage that osteoporosis similar to how they have managed their diabetes or cardio vascular health or any other chronic disease situation\u2026the FLS is really designed to be that transition period (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 2). Expanded scope beyond 3i model My role is basically to help assess and guide therapeutic plan with regards to these patients post hip fractures, especially with their osteoporosis care, medications to address that. As well as flagging any geriatric syndromes\u2026from my geriatric point of view is our success rate with getting these people into other services (Site 1, Participant 3). They're [FLS physician and clinical nurse] reviewing not just the patient's bone health, but just overall medical history and providing suggestions and recommendations. And if the patient does not require a full geriatric assessment he [FLS physician] will provide those suggestions -perhaps outpatient geriatric referral', 'perhaps rehab referral' or 'perhaps a day program referral' for PT in the community. So he would provide some of those suggestions or if he had to catch the patient who is having ongoing delirium post-operatively, he can provide some preliminary recommendations, not involving the patient geriatric consult service but he's able to try some suggestions on delirium management. So looking at the bone health and also looking at overall the patients' health (Site 1, Participant 11). The other piece about the FLS service is beyond the osteoporosis management which is also identifying patients with reoccurring falls. So especially in the 65 [years old] and above. Identifying geriatrics syndrome, in cognitive impairment, delirium, dementia, depression or poly pharmacy\u2026the experience in [name of beta site city] certainly has been, you know, not just identification of osteoporosis and treatment but also looking at all that complex medical problems from the pharmacy. And were seeing the same thing in [name of second site city] (Site 2, Participant 6). We decided to make ours a little bit broader in the sense that we did not want it just to be a medication type program. We also wanted to include some aspects of geriatric care because of the model that we developed and we were using care of the elderly physicians. So that was another piece to it. So we expanded the scope to include having physicians to start to identify those underlined geriatric syndromes that may be contributing to the fall initially. And then we also obviously deal with the osteoporosis medication and treatment piece of it but there is that added geriatric component (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 1). From the first day they realized that this could not be a cookie cutter approach. Not everyone was going to go on medication, not everyone wants to go on medication\u2026 You need to make sure that they are first educated and aware of their options. So I think that it's wonderful why the FLS goes for a year. Because sometimes at the point of care, surgery, people aren't ready to make some of these decisions. Maybe at 3 or 6 or 9 months down the road, when they are a little bit back to their normal self, maybe they can make some of these decisions (Site 1, Participant 1). It certainly helps to provide that greater education for patients so that then they can make informed decisions; patients and families and then their wants. We are also having to be patient centered, so giving them the options with the risks and benefits and then respecting whichever choice they choose to make (Site 1, Participant 4). We are still trying to ultimately preserve lives but then respect decisions of the patients themselves (Site 1, Participant 10) For me the FLS really aligns well with that because it is still patient centered (Site 2, ",

            "text": "You really do have to find someone [referring to FLS clinical nurse role] who has a passion, not only for osteoporosis therapy and management but for kind of the overall care of patients. You have to recognize that it's not just a prescription or it's not just an order, that these are people (Site 1, Participant 1). I often think it's people, not positions because if you have somebody who's, you know, just like our FLS team, it's going to fly. You could have somebody with the same position and not have any drive or passion and it would just flop. So I always believe it's people and what they believe in and what they want to bring. It's their passion and their commitment to what they want to do for the patients (Site 1, Participant 2). There's a bunch of different stake holders. There's the SCN, there's the physician, there's the orthopedic service, there's the hospital admin. And they just generally have an understanding or a will to want to do it (Site 1, Participant 3). I've said this in the past that I'm not so sure why everyone worries about the bird flu. We've already had a pandemic. It's called osteoporosis (Site 1, Participant 9). I have a great team. Most of them are just so passionate about hip fractures that they are open to all of these changes (Site 2, Participant 1). When they recruited the nurse clinician of the [name of 2nd site], she was just so passionate about the program. So you are passionate, you just get things goingWe had champions at those sites that were willing to stand up and say I want to lead this. We when we do program planning [we] recognize the barriers for making clinical change and lack of a champion is probably the biggest risk to any implementation project. So the fact that we had champions at those two sites really to stand up and take ownership of the program and to run the program, it raised those two sites to the top of the list (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 2). Well you need champions\u2026 I think that particularly that physician champion is essential (Site 1, Participant 1). I've been helping with identifying stakeholders, communicating how the plans will work, how to implement it on site and providing support to the FLS nurse and whatever issues that pop up with trying to identify patients. Or communication with staff in acute care. But then also meeting with the primary care physicians to try and help with that transition or communication between our team and primary care (Site 1, Participant 3). We had a champion on board\u2026 having that engaged physician, elder-friendly care physician, willing to participate and the FLS nurse (Site 2, Participant 7). We have a physician and we have a nurse and they were the main primary drivers of getting this thing up and rolling\u2026 I'm involved in the provincial working groups and the [name of city] zone working groups and [the FLS clinical nurse] always there at the table with us. So to be able to have her to speak to the program as well, she was like a promoter (Site 1, Participant 2). The nurse practitioner herself was a champion (Site 2, Participant 6).It's been foundational to how FLS has been designed from the get go. We've borrowed very heavily from past experience on implementing the Hip and Knee Care Pathway and implementing Catch a Break. All of these programs have influenced how we designed and rolled out the FLS right from site selection to the fact that we are doing a staged roll out through to how we communicate, how we engage with our stakeholders or how we even organized the content development and delivery of this program (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 2). As long as things are as simple as possible for everyone else that really helps with implementation; we have learned that in other change as well (Site 2, Participant 1). But basic learnings from regular change management in terms of good communication, good education or information of what's in it for them, why it's good for the patient, why it's a necessity to move forward, and change. Those are all primary things for effective change management (Site 2, Participant 7).",

            "text": "There's a certain fatigue of having these pilots come in and once the funding runs out, having them canceled (Site 1, Participant 3). I think its health care in general. There has been so much change even in the last two years and it just never stops coming\u2026So there is a sense among staff I think throughout healthcare that, you know, we are burned out, we cannot do anymore (Site 1, Participant 4). There's a lot going on. A lot of different initiatives (Site 1, Participant 6). The ortho world has had so many different things implemented in it over the last couple of years in terms, you know, we have implemented pathways, we have implemented forms and check lists and all kinds of things and I think we can learn The FLS nurse [is] doing the assessment to identify the patients who qualify for the FLS program and she is essentially doing all the work up to determine whether osteoporosis therapy is required (Site 2, Participant 4). So the FLS is really designed to identify these patients while they are still in hospital and really get them on the care pathway for osteoporosis treatments and make sure they are getting the right diagnostics, make sure they are getting the right drug therapy and the proper imagining and the necessary tests are being ordered It's not that they [primary care providers] do not want to provide osteoporosis therapy or teach. But sometimes they do not have the time or the ability to recognize the need or the ability to provide that education. So I think that having the FLS there is helping the providers (Site 1, Participant 1). I suspect there was a big gap there from when patients were discharged as far as flagging that for primary care physicians. Then to initiate treatment. There's been a huge care gap with patients. The population that we are dealing with is the hip fracture patients. So the orthopedic surgeons are terrific at fixing the fracture but then they do not do any follow up as far as cause of fracture i.e.",

I mean the rule of the [name of hospital] again that saying, \"If it's good for the patient, if its patient centered if it will improve patient care\" we'll buy into it (Site 2, Participant 6). The model of the program, it's about encouraging patients to participate in osteoporosis care and prevention. To accept resources in the community. But there are certain situationswe are always balancing things off -the financial picture of the patient, their ability to access services in the future, and their ability to pay for medication. And work with the patient to come up with the best game plan for the patient that incorporates that information\u2026you cannot force a patient to take a medication. That takes away their preference. You can provide the information and the supports available for the best courses of treatment (Site 2, Participant 7).It's encouraged in other guidelines like the NICE guidelines in the UK. It's considered best practice as far as having it in your post-op post hip fracture care. So just for all the reasons as far as consensus amongst even the British orthopaedic and geriatrics societies have agreed upon this as the gold standard of treatment. The evidence base for this program is very strong. We are not testing an unproven method here. We're actually applying strong evidence that we know works. So this is one of those few areas in health care where there's not a lot of controversy and not a lot of dispute over the value of this program. That's a very unique situation. Most of our programs, they are far greyer in terms of the economic and quality of impact on health service delivery. Here we have got pretty cut and dried strong evidence based, a lot of that evidence also is made in Alberta. We've got lots of research history in this area here in Alberta (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 2). Clinicians in the fragility and stability group have been excellent in getting this going.And this includes clinicians that extend past [this group], such as other physicians in the osteoporosis clinic. They have come together to provide knowledge\u2026so that we could pick their brains as to what is important to put in [our] FLS. What is important to send to family physicians?
