Evidence suggests that symptomatic RV infections accentuate an underlying predisposition for the development of asthma, which may be modulated by genetic host factors [8]. On the other hand, RV may also play a causal role in the development of asthma through promoting exaggerated inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness [9]. The recently identified RV-C [10] was found to be present in the majority of children admitted with wheezing or acute asthma exacerbations and was associated with increased severity of those exacerbations [11], [12], [13]. By contrast, asymptomatic RV-C infections have also been reported in healthy controls [14].",

Participating parents were instructed and reminded throughout the study period to contact the study team whenever their infant experienced respiratory tract symptoms from November 2009 until December 2012. The presence of symptoms was assessed using a standardized telephone interview. Infants experiencing cough, wheezing, laboured breathing and/or dyspnoea sufficiently severe for parents to warrant a visit to their general practitioner entered the symptomatic arm of the study and were visited by the study team within 8 hours after establishing these symptoms. If parents refrained from contacting the study team or contacted the study team after visiting the general practitioner and obtaining medical treatment, these children were not included. During the visit, the presence and severity of acute respiratory symptoms were assessed by both parents and the on-site researcher. The researchers were well trained to recognize wheezing. The intra-class correlation was validated by means of evaluation of tracheal sound recordings by five paediatric pulmonologists in the first 30 patients, which reached a Crohnbachs \u03b1 of 0.75. The study team assessed symptom severity (physician symptom score) by scoring the presence of suprasternal retractions, scalene muscle contraction, air entry and wheezing by auscultation, all part of the Paediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure [15]. Values of the physician symptom score range from 0 to 10 with increasing values indicating increased severity. Parents self-assessed the severity by Asthma Control Questionnaire [15] modified for by-proxy use, although it has not been validated for this application. If wheezing could not be confirmed during the first visit, children were revisited and re-assessed when symptoms recurred. For each child only one symptomatic visit was included in the study.",
