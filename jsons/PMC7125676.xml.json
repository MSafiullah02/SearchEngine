            "text": "The biochemical basis of error-prone replication is that most RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (RdDp) (reverse transcriptases, RT) that have been characterized to date, lack a domain corresponding to a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonucleolytic activity capable of excising incorrectly incorporated nucleotides \u2013 which produce a mismatch at the growing 3\u2032-end \u2013 to allow incorporation of the correct nucleotide, base-paired with the template. This 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonucleolytic activity is termed proofreading-repair activity, and its absence in most RdRp and RdDp has been documented by structural and biochemical studies (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006, Friedberg et al., 2006, Steinhauer et al., 1992, Steitz, 1999). Recently, a domain corresponding to a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease has been identified and characterized in some coronaviruses (Exo N in nsp14 of the SARS coronavirus). This exonucleolytic function plays an essential role in coronavirus RNA replication, but its possible contribution to RNA copying fidelity has not been demonstrated yet (Minskaia et al., 2006). Copying fidelity by RdRp and RdDp is determined by the relative rates of incorporation of the correct versus an incorrect nucleotide [recent studies with viral enzymes reviewed in (Arnold et al., 2005, Men\u00e9ndez-Arias, 2002a)]. Average error rates for RNA viruses are in the range of 10\u22123 to 10\u22125 misincorporations per nucleotide copied (Batschelet et al., 1976, Drake and Holland, 1999). Mutant viral polymerases displaying either increased or decreased copying fidelity due to specific amino acid replacements have been characterized (Arnold et al., 2005, Mansky et al., 2003, Men\u00e9ndez-Arias, 2002a, Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003, Vignuzzi et al., 2006). A consequence is that error-prone replication can itself affect the catalytic properties of viral polymerases, altering their error rates that can be subjected to selection (Arnold et al., 1999).",

            "text": "A relevant, largely unanswered question, is whether proteins involved in repair functions are accessible to viral DNA genomes during their replication. Depending on the intracellular site of DNA genome replication, as well as the stoichiometry of available repair proteins in relation to the number of viral DNA genomes in a replication factory, postreplicative repair functions may be inefficient also on viral DNA. A possible limitation of postreplicative correction, together with the type of molecular mechanism involved in DNA replication \u2013 predominance of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA forms \u2013, and whether a low fidelity or high fidelity DdDp catalyses nucleotide incorporation, will determine the error rate levels during viral DNA replication [reviewed in (Domingo, 2007)]. There is evidence that some DNA viruses with limited genetic complexity share with RNA viruses great genetic heterogeneity and potential for rapid adaptation, for example the animal parvoviruses (L\u00f3pez-Bueno et al., 2003, L\u00f3pez-Bueno et al., 2006) and the plant geminiviruses (Isnard et al., 1998). To what extent simple and complex DNA viruses can exploit localized or generalized high mutation rates, and to what extent genetic variation affects their pathogenicity, are important questions requiring additional research.",

Some cellular editing enzymes, such as the ADAR or APOBEC families of nucleic acid deaminases constitute part of the innate defense mechanisms against viral infections (Sheehy et al., 2002). The APOBEC cytidine deaminases act on single stranded DNA and lead to G \u2192 A and C \u2192 U hypermutation. The ADAR adenosine deaminases act on double stranded viral RNA and lead to A \u2192 G and U \u2192 C hypermutation [reviews in (Chiu and Greene, 2006, Valente and Nishikura, 2005)]. These cellular deaminase activities are involved in diversification of immunoglobulin genes (for example protein AID, a member of the APOBEC family) and in mRNA or tRNA editing, thus contributing to generate RNA and protein diversity (Schaub and Keller, 2002). In the face of a viral infection, they are part of the innate antiviral host response. Some viral proteins have evolved to counteract the hypermutagenic activity of cellular deaminases (Vif of HIV-1 binds APOBEC-3G and prevents the encapsidation of the deaminase into viral particles and the subsequent hypermutagenic activity on minus strand DNA).",

In homologous recombination there is extensive nucleotide sequence identity between the two parental genomes around the cross-over site. Non-homologous recombination is not associated with substantial nucleotide sequence identity. Replicative recombination requires viral genome replication to occur. Non-replicative recombination has been discovered with some RNA viruses, upon cotransfection of cells with viral RNA fragments which cannot replicate by themselves (Gallei et al., 2004, Gmyl et al., 2003). A common form of homologous, replicative recombination that probably operates in DNA and RNA viruses is copy choice or template switching; it involves detachment from a template of the polymerase complex with a nascent product, and continuation of the copying process at the same position of another template molecule.",

Defective genomes are increasingly recognized as active participants in the evolutionary behaviour of viral populations [reviewed in (Domingo, 2007)]. Different viruses exploit recombination to different extents, either as an exploratory activity to produce new genomic combinations, or as a means to rescue viable genomes from parental genomes with debilitating mutations. Host proteins such as endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases may modulate the recombination frequencies inherent to each polymerization machinery (Cheng et al., 2006, Serviene et al., 2005). Recombination has been characterized in several hepatitis viruses (Bollyky et al., 1996, Costa-Mattioli et al., 2003, Cristina and Colina, 2006, Gauss-Muller and Kusov, 2002, Kalinina et al., 2002, Noppornpanth et al., 2006, Wang and Chao, 2005, Yang et al., 2006), therefore adding recombination to mutation as a mechanism of genome variation in this important group of pathogens.

Mutation and mutant frequencies are influenced by the capacity of any mutant to produce progeny, relative to the capacity of the non-mutated class or of other mutants produced in the same replicative ensemble.

The reason why the FMDV RdRp appears to be biochemically \u201cinstructed\u201d to generate an internal oligoadenylate (not described in any natural isolate of an animal virus, but found is some plant viruses) is probably a propensity towards slippage mutagenesis (also termed polymerase \u201cstuttering\u201d) at four successive adenylated residues (or their complementary uridylate residues in the minus strand RNA) that precede the second functional AUG codon. Current evidence suggests that during plaque-to-plaque transfers, negative selection (elimination of unfit genomes) is less intense than during large population passages which involve a more pronounced competition among genomes. In the course of repeated plaque-to-plaque transfers, biochemical instruction prevails over selection [for a review of this aspect of RNA genetics, see (Escarm\u00eds et al., 2006)].",

The technical details and calculations used to derive a mutation rate or frequency must be examined with care. Some published values used to claim low mutation rates for some RNA viruses were in reality based on an extrapolation of the frequency of a subset of advantageous or neutral mutations (for example, scored in individual viral plaques), excluding deleterious mutations which are often the most abundant during virus replication. In examining claims of unusually low mutation rates and high polymerase copying fidelity for an RNA virus, based on a mutation frequency, the reader should consider that an outstanding low value (<10\u22126 substitutions per nucleotide) may mean either: (a) a selective disadvantage of the genome that harbors the mutation on which the calculation is based, or (b) the requirement of two or more mutations when the alteration of a phenotypic trait is measured. (The frequency of occurrence of n mutations in the same genome is obtained by multiplying the frequency of occurrence of each individual mutation; thus, if the average frequency for one mutation is 10\u22124 a triple mutant is expected at a frequency of about 10\u221212), (c) a general or site-specific high polymerase fidelity, which should arise a very definite interest with regard to its molecular basis (Holland et al., 1992). Conversely, a high mutation frequency for a DNA virus whose replication is catalyzed by a high fidelity DdDp main mean that either (a) repair activities are not functional, or (b) the mutant overgrows the wild type (due to a selective constraint, fitness advantage, or other) prior to the measurement of its frequency. Some mathematical treatments to calculate mutation rates taking into account reversion of a low fitness mutant and its competition with wild type have been published, most of them derived from the original equations proposed by (Batschelet et al., 1976).",

The latter is generally calculated by comparing the consensus sequence of sequential viral isolates, and it includes a time factor, so that it is commonly expressed as substitutions per nucleotide and year. A compilation of 56 different measurements for RNA viruses show that most values fall in the range of 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 substitutions per nucleotide and year (s/n/y), with a few outstandingly high (10\u22121\u201310\u22122\n s/n/y) or low (10\u22127\u201310\u22128\n s/n/y) values (Domingo, 2007). The rates of evolution estimated for HCV are in the range of 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n s/n/y (Abe et al., 1992, Lu et al., 2001, Ogata et al., 1991, Okamoto et al., 1992, Smith et al., 1997), and those for HGV are of 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n s/n/y (Gim\u00e9nez-Barcons et al., 1998, Nakao et al., 1997). A broader range of 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 3 \u00d7 10\u22122\n s/n/y has been determined for the delta antigen (Imazeki et al., 1990, Lee et al., 1992). These values for HDV show that a defective virus can evolve at rates comparable to non-defective, standard viruses, as documented also by the rapid evolution of other subviral replicons (Domingo et al., 2001).",

Currently, HCV isolates of a different genotype correspond to those showing an average nucleotide sequence similarity in their genomes in the range of 65\u201369%; those of a different subtype show a nucleotide sequence similarity of 77\u201380%, and 91\u201399.9% for components of the mutant spectrum of the same quasispecies (Clementi, 2003). These boundaries are rather arbitrary, may require periodic updating, and are not applicable to other viruses. In particular, a viral quasispecies may produce divergent outliers in their exploration of sequence space. The extent of divergence varies for different genomic regions. In HCV, the glycoprotein E1 \u2013 and E2 \u2013 coding regions may differ in up to 50% of nucleotides among independent isolates, and even more when some protein subdomains are analyzed (Clementi, 2003).",

Although the generality of high mutation rates is widely accepted today, some have argued that due to the detrimental nature of most mutations, the adaptive value of the RNA virus extreme mutation rate has to be carefully reconsidered, suggesting the existence of a trade-off between replication efficiency and copying fidelity. In their view, high mutation rates are a consequence of rapid RNA replication, and an increase in copying fidelity would come at a cost, resulting in a lower replication rate. Studies with a high fidelity mutant of poliovirus (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006) have documented that the mutant replicated at a slightly lower rate than wild type virus in cell culture, but that it had a strong selective disadvantage regarding invasion of the brain of susceptible mice. Control experiments showed that the impediment to cause neuropathology was due to the limited complexity of the mutant spectrum as the virus replicated in mice. Thus, in this case, high mutation rates and a broad mutant spectrum were essential for virus adaptability to a complex environment such as that provided by host organisms.",

A lower than standard (typical of wild type virus) mutation rate may be sufficient when one (or very few) mutation(s) can cause a decrease in the sensitivity of the virus to the inhibitor. [Incidentally, the ease of deriving resistance to antiviral inhibitors, in particular nucleoside analogues (which is often associated with a single amino acid substitution in the relevant enzyme), may have an ancient evolutionary basis, in the need of primitive replication systems to cope with inhibitory metabolites.] This possibility was discussed previously in connection with quasispecies and drug resistance [see (Domingo, 2003), and previous versions of that article].",

In that case, a high mutation rate and a complex mutant spectrum may not only confer a selective advantage to the virus but may become imperative for long-term survival. Remarkably, increasing evidence suggests that constellations of mutations required for adaptability may be located either in the same genomic molecule or in a number of different genomes which may complement each other, again requiring a rich, broad and complex mutant spectrum (Moreno et al., 1997, Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006). Standard mutation rate values, as those recorded for many RNA viruses (Domingo, 2007), may have been inherited from primitive protein-mediated replication systems or may have been the outcome of adaptation after extended episodes of co-evolution with their hosts in complex and variable environments. Although additional experiments are needed to generalize the possible adaptive advantage of complex mutant spectra, current experimental evidence supports an adaptive value for high mutation rates of RNA viruses, independent of the rate of viral RNA synthesis. Obviously, this does not exclude that high or low fidelity mutants could be found that manifest also a substantial alteration of the rate of RNA synthesis. Most likely, however, copying fidelity will be the result of multiple factors, and additional studies are necessary to assess to what extent the replication rate is one of them.",

Interference by a class of defective genomes termed \u201cdefectors\u201d has been proposed to contribute to viral extinction through enhanced mutagenesis (virus entry into error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis, reviewed in Section 7). These effects necessitate of coinfection of the same cell by multiple virus variants or that the latter be generated within an infected cell. For some viruses, there is evidence that multiple particles infect each susceptible cell in vivo, and that some cell subsets may be prone to multiple infections (Cicin-Sain et al., 2005, Chohan et al., 2005).",

The relevance of HBV s antigen mutants at the epidemiological level is suggested by an increase in the prevalence of s mutants following anti-HB vaccination of children (Hsu et al., 1999). A clonal analysis of viral sequences from chronic HBV carriers documented that the coexistence of hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen and anti-HBs antibodies was associated with an increase of \u201ca\u201d determinant heterogeneity, with substitutions that had been described as immune escape variants (Lada et al., 2006).

There is increasing evidence of the involvement of CTL-escape mutants in HCV persistence in humans (Chang et al., 1997, Timm et al., 2004); [review in (Bowen and Walker, 2005)]. Similar observations have been made regarding clonality of the immune response to HBV, and selection of escape mutants (Margeridon et al., 2005). The contribution of mutants that evade recognition by helper (CD4+) T lymphocytes and cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes to viral persistence has been described for several virus\u2013host systems (Ciurea et al., 2001, Goulder et al., 1997, Kawada et al., 2006, Koenig et al., 1995, Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu and Arts, 2006). A number of mechanisms of CTL-escape have been identified [reviewed by Bowen and Walker (2005)]: (a) amino acid substitutions that diminish or abolish binding of the epitope to MHC class I molecules, so that MHC-peptide complexes are not expressed or cannot be recognized by T cell receptors (TCRs); (b) amino acid replacements that alter the intracellular processing of viral proteins, leading to peptides that do not bind efficiently to MHC class I molecules; (c) the presence of substituted epitopes that may antagonize responses to the wild type epitope.",

Mechanism (a) has been suggested by reversion of epitope mutations in HIV-1, either at later stages of a persistent infection, when a specific CTL pressure wanes, or upon transmission of the virus to individuals who express a different MHC allele repertoire (Borrow et al., 1997, Friedrich et al., 2004, Leslie et al., 2004, Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu and Arts, 2006). Mechanism (b) has not been explored in vivo, but it has been documented in model studies in cell culture (Martin et al., 2006). The experiments show that, independently of possible fitness costs entailed by an Ab-escape mutation, the different fitness levels that can be attained by variants with the same antigenic profile, affect the mutant repertoire selected by a neutralizing monoclonal Ab (Martin et al., 2006).",

The most extensively studied case, due to its dramatic consequences for medical practice, is resistance of HIV-1 to the antiretroviral agents used in therapy, selected in infected patients subjected to antiretroviral therapy (Men\u00e9ndez-Arias, 2002b, Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu and Arts, 2006). The fitness costs of a drug-resistance mutation will influence its permanence in the infected organisms in the presence or absence of the drug. Maintenance of genomes bearing a debilitating drug-resistance mutation can be achieved through compensatory mutations (Nijhuis et al., 1999). Emergence of HBV mutants resistant to antiviral inhibitors generally results in progression of liver disease (Bartholomeusz and Locarnini, 2006b). Subtitution M204 I/V in the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) affects the catalytic domain (YMDD) and is selected by lamivudine and L-nucleosides. Resistance to adefovir is associated with RT substitutions N236T and A181V. The key substitutions conferring lamivudine resistance in HBV located within domain C of its polymerase, entail a decrease in replication efficiency which can be compensated by substitutions located in domain B of the polymerase (Allen et al., 1998, Delaney et al., 2003, Fu and Cheng, 1998).",

Resistance to ribavirin is a very special case because it is possible that part of the anti-HCV activity of this nucleoside analogue is exerted via its mutagenic activity (lethal mutagenesis). The isolation of viruses resistant to ribavirin implies that viruses have the potential to escape extinction by lethal mutagenesis (this is discussed in Section 7).",

Some early recognized guidelines, in addition to the use of combination therapy, included the temporary shelving of drugs to try to minimize circulation of drug-resistant virus variants, and limitation of the time of treatment (Domingo and Holland, 1992). Similar concerns are expressed in the face of possible emerging and reemerging viral infections (Regoes and Bonhoeffer, 2006). Obviously, the time required to develop resistance to antiviral inhibitors may vary for different viruses because of differences in the cycles of intra-host replication and transmission. Selection of resistant viral mutants is a direct consequence of the statistical consequences of quasispecies dynamics (see the calculation of the approximate frequency of a triple mutant mentioned in Section 2), supported both experimentally and by theoretical considerations (Bonhoeffer et al., 1997, Coffin, 1995, N\u00e1jera et al., 1995)].",

A revealing example was the demonstration that molecular clones of SIV copied from the genome of viruses isolated from macaques displaying different degrees of AIDS-like disease reproduced the disease stage from the original animals when inoculated into na\u00efve macaques (Kimata et al., 1999).

There is evidence that HCV infection may be associated with some cardiac disorders (Matsumori et al., 2006, Matsumori et al., 2000). This reinforces the concept put forward decades ago that mutant forms of RNA viruses can be associated with atypical forms of disease (Holland et al., 1982). It is worth recalling a statement by J. J. Holland and his colleagues: \u201cThere is an unspoken assumption among many physicians and scientists that a particular RNA virus will generally cause a particular disease. This assumption may be true in a very broad practical sense, but it is important to understand that it can never be true in a formal scientific sense. Because a particular RNA virus simply does not exist, a particular RNA virus disease does not exist either. The science of infections diseases is still in its infancy because we still understand so little of the fine details of host-pathogen interactions\u201d (Holland et al., 1992).",

There is a transition in the first months of the infection from acute to chronic disease followed by longstanding disease. In transfusion recipients, Farci and colleagues demonstrated a correlation during this transition between the evolutionary dynamics of the virus and clinical outcome (Farci et al., 2000). Patients infected by viruses that underwent little evolution during the acute stage of infection recovered completely, whereas patients in which the virus evolved rapidly, developed chronic infection. The authors concluded that the diversity of the viral population depends on the host immune response. If the response is effective, the diversity of the HCV quasispecies declines until the final variant is cleared. These findings have prognostic value for hepatitis C acquired by transfusion.",

In other words, the recipient is infected with a \u201cwell structured\u201d quasispecies. But this may be not the case after infection by other transmission routes. If the size of the viral inoculum is very small, mutations can accumulate without a possibility of effective selection and, ultimately, the viral spectrum will be more and more heterogeneous until extinction. In this case a fittest virus may never be found (Mas et al., 2004). This observation was interpreted according to the error catastrophe theory (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2006). As discussed in Section 7, any replicating system can only accept a maximum average error rate without losing its encoded information. Mutation frequencies for RNA viruses suggest that they might replicate near their error threshold, and on occasions they might briefly exceed it (Eigen and Biebricher, 1988, Holland, 2006). The proposal of Sol\u00e9 and colleagues could provide an explanation for the spontaneous resolution of the infection in non-transfused patients exposed to HCV. In fact, recovery appears to be more common among patients exposed to small inocula such as those produced by accidental needle sticks, intravenous drug use, and sexual transmission, than among those infected by a large virus dose. The low risk of persistence after exposure and seroconversion in sexual transmission has been associated with the small number of viral particles carrying a limited combination of mutations (unstructured quasispecies) which may decrease the potential for overcoming the immune response of the exposed host (Quer et al., 2005). Although the precise factors influencing viral clearance or persistence are not well understood, a significant association has been found between a broad and sustained HCV-specific T cell response and viral clearance in acute hepatitis C infection. In addition, the mode of transmission may be one of the factors that determine the transition from acute to persistent infection.",

Although some reports suggest a higher rate of progression among patients infected with more complex quasispecies, the latter is probably a reflection of disease duration. This observation may fit the theoretical models of viral diversification in which antigenic variants are not completely replaced by emergent ones, and the continuous accumulation of variants could reflect a history of immune evasion and cell destruction (Nowak and Schuster, 1989, Nowak et al., 1991). In a study involving a large cohort of patients, complexity of the quasispecies correlated with ALT levels, which could mean that the complexity could be related with immune-mediated liver injury (Rothman et al., 2005).",

First, the composition of the circulating viral population does not always reflect the composition of the hepatic population (Cabot et al., 2000, Jang et al., 1999, Maggi et al., 1997, Roque-Afonso et al., 2005). Second, in some patients extrahepatic replication may represent an important contribution to the complexity of circulating quasispecies (Deforges et al., 2004, Forton et al., 2004, Pal et al., 2006). Third, continuous reorganisation of the quasispecies structure, with periods of relative stability in some patients and sporadic variations in major and minor variants in others, seems to be frequent (Cabot et al., 2001, Franco et al., 2003) (Fig. 2\n). Fourth, the re-appearance of memory variants that respond to \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d external stimuli (Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 2000) may induce quick shifts in the composition of the population, as shown in the case of HIV-1 (Briones et al., 2003). Re-inoculation studies in chronically HCV-infected chimpanzees in which pre-existing, slower replicating quasispecies outlived faster-replicating variants in the second inoculation, may be a good example of the memory property of HCV (Wyatt et al., 1998). More indirect evidence of involvement of memory genomes is found in longitudinal evaluation of replicating quasispecies in chronically infected patients (Cabot et al., 2001, Franco et al., 2003).",

Among the virological factors, a low viral load and a HCV genotype other than 1 are optimal conditions for a sustained response. With respect to the influence of viral quasispecies in a sustained response, several studies have focused on the complexity (number of variants) and diversity (mean genetic distance between variants) of the viral population at baseline. Other studies have addressed the dynamics of the quasispecies after initiation of treatment, or the variations and evolution at specific genomic regions with a potential to mediate drug resistance. These viral parameters have also been analysed in combination with parameters that define the host immune response. Next we review some of these approaches.",

(1992) first reported that the degree of variability of the HVR1 region of the E2 gene correlated with interferon responsiveness, and several studies have confirmed the correlation between quasispecies complexity and response to interferon therapy. Patients with more complex HVR1 populations (Enomoto et al., 1994, Kanazawa et al., 1994, Koizumi et al., 1995, Le Guen et al., 1997), or with a greater degree of intra-population divergence (Polyak et al., 1997) respond less well or do not respond to treatment. The availability of the combination of Peg-IFN and ribavirin, which provides a more effective antiviral response, has led to re-evaluation of the issue of quasispecies as a predictive factor for response to treatment. Farci et al. (2002) questioned whether pre-treatment viral diversity could predict the final response, but found an interesting association between the reduction in quasispecies diversity once treatment is started and viral clearance; such a reduction had prognostic value. These results again contrast with the more varied pattern of quasispecies evolution in responders found by Chambers et al. (2005). A study with a large cohort of patients showed that increased quasispecies diversity, together with active and specific anti-HCV immune status before starting therapy, was associated with a poor virologic response (Morishima et al., 2006). This is consistent with the idea that the immune response drives quasispecies diversity in vivo, and also may provide some light to interpret different results in other studies which involved a lower number of patients.",

            "text": "The majority of studies analysing the implications of HCV quasispecies in the response to antiviral treatment have focused on HVR1 of the E2 gene. In 1995, Enomoto et al. suggested that the genetic heterogeneity at a specific domain of the non-structural 5A (NS5A) region of HCV, known as the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR), was closely related to the response to treatment in Japanese patients with HCV genotype 1b infection (Enomoto et al., 1995). This issue raised some controversy because in some studies from Western countries (Chambers et al., 2005, Squadrito et al., 1997), but not all (Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2001, Saiz et al., 1998), most HCV-1 infected patients with a sustained virological response showed no or only a few mutations within the ISDR region. The sequence adjacent to the ISDR domain may be involved in PKR binding and thus linked to IFN resistance, but once more, even though this region may play a role in HCV resistance to naturally-secreted IFN, it is not confirmed that the region contains determinants for blocking administered IFN-alfa (Nousbaum et al., 2000). In another study, Taylor et al. (1999) demonstrated that envelope protein 2 (E2) of HCV genotype 1a/1b contains a 12-amino-acid sequence that is similar to the PKR autophosphorylation site and to the phosphorylation site of the translation initiation factor eIF2-alfa, the latter being a target for PKR. This has been named the PePHD domain. The authors showed that E2 from genotype 1 HCV, but not type 2 or 3 isolates, can interact with, and inhibit the kinase activity of PKR in cell cell-free systems. Nevertheless, it does not seem that the mutational pattern in this region influences the response to IFN-alfa (Quer et al., 2004), nor could the emergence of mutations in this region be correlated with treatment outcome. Thus, the sequence of this region before or during treatment cannot be used to predict the success of treatment (Gaudy et al., 2005).",

One is the discovery that ribavirin, which is extensively used in anti-HCV therapy (Section 6), acts as mutagenic agent for some viruses (Crotty et al., 2000, Graci and Cameron, 2006). Since ribavirin is a licensed drug that has been amply used to treat several viral infections, it is possible that, in some cases, its antiviral activity has been exerted through (or with the contribution of) mutagenesis. A key question is whether ribavirin may exert its anti-HCV activity with the participation of lethal mutagenesis. There is evidence that ribavirin induces error-prone replication of GB virus B in primary tamarin hepatocytes (Lanford et al., 2001). Mycophenolic acid, which as ribavirin, is an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (resulting in reduced intracellular GTP pools) had no antiviral effect, and virions from ribavirin-treated cultures showed dramatic reductions of specific infectivity. Inhibition of replication and increases in mutation frequency were quantitated in full-length and subgenomic HCV replicons (Contreras et al., 2002, Kanda et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2003).",

Some studies have provided evidence of increased mutation frequencies of HCV in patients treated with ribavirin (Asahina et al., 2005) while other studies have not found significant increases. Relevant considerations are the effective ribavirin-nucleotide concentrations that can be attained in vivo at the sites of HCV replication, relative to the concentrations found effective in cell culture, possible intervention of host factors that may alter the behavior of NS5B, and others (Airaksinen et al., 2003, Hong, 2003).

The main conclusions from these studies are: (a) the transition towards extinction occurs with a decrease of specific infectivity (ratio of infectious to total genomes), without modification of the consensus sequence, and variable increases in mutant spectrum complexity. (b) In the cases in which a comparative study has been carried out, virus extinction was dependent on a mutagenic action, not merely on inhibitory activity manifested by the mutagen. This was documented by the incapacity of inhibitory combinations to extinguish the virus despite reaching the same degree of inhibition than attained in the presence of the mutagenic agent and that mediated extinction (Pariente et al., 2003). (c) Viral extinction is facilitated by low viral fitness and low viral load. (d) Preextinction viral RNA (from mutagenized viral populations, prior to extinction) can interfere with infectivity. These observation [reviewed in (Anderson et al., 2004, Domingo, 2007, Domingo, 2005)] support the view that mutagenesis, and not solely inhibition of viral replication, mediates viral extinction in accord with the parameters (effect of viral load and viral fitness) included in the error threshold relationship (Biebricher and Eigen, 2005, Eigen, 2002).",

The experimental results, based on a decrease of virus infectivity preceding a decrease of virus replication, were supported by in silico modeling studies using realistic parameters. In this view, viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis would be facilitated by both lethal mutations and debilitating mutations that could exert a deleterious effect on the quasispecies as a whole. The negative effect of defective genomes can be viewed as an extreme case of suppressive effects of the mutant spectrum, discussed in Section 4.1 (Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2004, Grande-P\u00e9rez et al., 2005).",

(A) An infected individual contains multiple, replicating viral quasispecies, even within the same organ. Here two mutant spectra are depicted with their consensus sequences. Each horizontal line represents a genome, and each symbol on a line represents a type of mutation. Real viral quasispecies can contain thousands of continuously mutating genomes that conform huge mutant clouds. (B) The passage regime of the virus can affect virus population fitness. Small arrows represent repeated bottleneck passages which result in fitness decrease. The large arrow represents large population passages that generally result in fitness gain. Fluctuations in fitness shown at high and low fitness values (at the two small angles of the fitness triangle) have been observed experimentally and interpreted as the stochastic effect of mutations on fitness when fitness gain is limited by population size or when fitness is very low.
