As with most infectious syndromes outlined in this text, the increased risk of respiratory tract disease encountered in transplant recipients relates in part to defects in innate and adaptive immunity. Within this population, however, the incidence and microbiological etiology of respiratory infections are quite variable. This is due in part to the use of heterogeneous immunosuppressive regimens and differing prophylactic antibiotic strategies. In addition to diminished host immunity, anatomic breaches in upper and lower respiratory tract defenses may increase the susceptibility of immunocompromised hosts to a variety of common and opportunistic pathogens. Such anatomical considerations are especially important in patients who have undergone thoracic surgery for lung and heart transplantation and individuals who have required prolonged mechanical ventilation. Medical devices such as nasogastric and endotracheal tubes hinder coordinated glottic movement and mucociliary function and act as conduits for the introduction of pathogenic organisms to the respiratory tract [2] .",

Neutropenia: Commonly associated with medication toxicities, chemotherapy, hematological malignancies, and viral infections, deficits in neutrophil count and function can increase the risk of infection with staphylococci, streptococci, Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), and fungi [3, 4] . 2. T lymphocyte deficiency: Caused by many transplant immunosuppressive medications that include calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, glucocorticoids. T lymphocyte deficiency is also encountered in the setting of HIV infection, lymphoma, leukemia, and infection/reactivation of various herpesviruses, especially Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Patients with cellular immune dysfunction are at increased risk of respiratory infection due to intracellular organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Legionella spp., and Toxoplasma gondii, mycobacteria, fungi-like Cryptococcus spp., Histoplasma capsulatum, and Pneumocystis jirovecii, as well as CMV, Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and respiratory viruses [5] [6] [7] Because such immune defects are often mixed, careful attention to clinical and radiographic features as well as recognition of nosocomial versus community sources of infection are critical to making a correct diagnosis and initiating empiric antimicrobial therapy [1] . In both solid organ transplant and HSCT recipients, delays in appropriate antimicrobial therapy may increase the risk of secondary complications and infection-associated deaths, especially in those with severe immunosuppression. Therefore, it is common practice to initiate empiric or preemptive antimicrobial therapy in patients for whom the suspicion of infection is high.",

In most cases, cultures of nasal discharge are not helpful; a nasal wash for bacterial cultures and a PCR panel that assesses a number of common and uncommon respiratory viruses may considerably improve diagnostic yeild. When imaging is obtained, fluid levels are found in 86% of cases [6] . Although a wide variety of organisms can cause acute sinusitis, the vast majority of infections are due to viral pathogens. These include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and even CMV [14] [15] [16] . Viral infections can be short-lived but viral shedding can be prolonged among immunocompromised patients. Bacterial sinus infections are much less common and rarely occur with less than 7 days of symptoms [17] . Common bacterial causes of acute bacterial sinusitis include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, S. aureus, and anaerobes. Pseudomonas can be a prominent sinus pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients both before and after lung transplantation [18, 19] . While most cases of acute bacterial sinusitis are caused by one predominant organism, up to one quarter have two distinct pathogens present in high concentration [20] . It is important to note, however, that in routine clinical practice, the majority of patients with acute sinusitis do not have a bacterial pathogen isolated.",

Complications of acute sinusitis include facial cellulitis, preseptal periorbital cellulitis, brain abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and orbital invasion that may result in sight and life threatening orbital (post-septal) cellulitis [21] . Intracraneal extension should be suspected if mental status changes occur or if there are focal neurological signs [22] . CT imaging or MRI scan should be urgently obtained, and otolaryngology evaluation with endoscopy should be sought for both diagnosis (cultures and histology) and therapeutic drainage.

As such, both are generally defined as a self-limited inflammation of the large airways of the lung, or bronchi, due to an infection. As opposed to pneumonia, the lower airways are not involved, and chest imaging is generally normal. Patients typically present with a cough lasting more than 5 days, an important factor distinguishing it from mild upper respiratory infection (URI) [36] . Symptoms usually persist for 10-20 days but may extend for more than 4 weeks. Most patients report purulent sputum, indicating sloughing of tracheobronchial epithelium and inflammation. As opposed to bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis does not usually present with progressive cough, wheezing, tachypnea, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, entails continuing symptoms on most days of the month for at least 3 months of the year during two consecutive years.",

As the common clinical and radiographic manifestations of pneumonia may be absent or attenuated in immunosuppressed patients due to impaired inflammatory responses [1] , the diagnosis of pneumonia may be difficult to establish in solid allograft transplant and both autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. Adding to this diagnostic challenge is the frequent colonization of the upper airway with microorganisms that do not contribute to lung disease, rendering the microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia by conventional culture techniques difficult. Conversely, sterile respiratory tract cultures do not exclude an infectious etiology, particularly in the setting of recent exposure to broadspectrum antibiotics. The common use of prophylactic antimicrobials in transplant recipients may contribute to suppression of culture results while increasing the risk of infections that are resistant to commonly used antimicrobial agents given for infection prophylaxis such as fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, triazole-based antifungals, and valacyclovir or valganciclovir [57] [58] [59] .",

S. pneumoniae remains the most commonly identified pathogen and the most frequent cause of lethal CAP [63] . S. aureus, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and other GNB may also cause lifethreatening CAP. Recently, other non-lactose fermenting (NF)-GNB such as Stenotrophomonas, Burkholderia, Chryseobacterium, Achromobacter, and Alcaligenes species have been increasingly recognized as etiologic agents in both CAP and nosocomial infections [64] . S. pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, and Moraxella catarrhalis also cause CAP less frequently. The incidence of CAP associated with the atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. varies widely with patient age, seasonal variation, and geographic location. Viral pneumonias, most commonly caused by influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, are also sources of CAP, which may be severe in the setting of transplantation. It is important to note that lower respiratory tract infections may be due to a mixed population of viruses, bacteria, and fungi in solid organ transplant and HSCT recipients [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] .",

Pneumonia associated with large-volume aspiration of gastric contents typically occurs as a late finding. The acidic gastric contents act as a poor medium for bacterial growth. Thus, the initial clinical syndrome following aspiration of gastric contents arises from the direct caustic effect of the acidic aspirate on the cells of the alveolarcapillary interface, i.e., chemical pneumonitis. A true bacterial pneumonia, if it occurs, is consequently a superimposed process. Aspiration of oral contents, by contrast, results from inhalation of nonsterile oropharyngeal material.

Nocardia asteroides complex, including N. asteroides sensu stricto and N. farcinica, accounts for nearly 90% of Nocardia infections, both in cancer patients and the general population. Risk factors for Nocardia pneumonia include profound deficiencies in cellular immunity, prolonged use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, especially in the treatment of chronic lung diseases [84] , and the presence of GVHD. Solid organ transplant recipients are also at particular risk for Nocardia infections although this varies based upon the organ transplanted. One review demonstrated infection rates of 3.5%, 2.5%, 1.3%, 0.2%, and 0.1% among recipients of the lungs, hearts, intestines, livers, and kidneys, respectively [85] . Nocardia infections commonly occur within the 1st year of transplantation although early (<1 month) and late (>2 years) infections have also been reported [85] [86] [87] . Infection with the organism should be considered if nodular pulmonary infiltrates are seen, although reticulonodular or diffuse infiltrates are occasionally described. Solitary nodules associated with irregular, thick-walled cavities that mimic invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, necrotizing cancer, or chronic bacterial lung abscess have also been associated with Nocardia infection. Indolent Nocardia pneumonia may be clinically indistinguishable from other actinomycetes infections and from pneumonias caused by pulmonary eumycetes. Severely immunosuppressed cancer patients with refractory leukemia or prior allogenic HSCT may present with rapidly progressive multifocal nocardiosis. Spontaneous pneumothorax and hemoptysis are also recognized presentations of Nocardia infection among immunocompromised patients. Concomitant brain involvement is not uncommon, and preemptive evaluation is recommended to diagnose asymptomatic brain abscess in patients with pulmonary Nocardia infection. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (10-12 mg/kg daily) is effective against many Nocardia species. Retrospective studies suggest that clinical outcomes are improved when appropriate therapy is given for an extended period of time (6-12 months) [88] . Despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy, pulmonary nocardiosis carries a high mortality in immunosuppressed individuals [84] . Pulmonary actinomycosis typically presents in a very similar manner to nocardiosis, although it is classically associated with invasion across tissue plans. As such, pulmonary infection may involve the adjoining pleura and subsequently erode through the chest wall. Isolation of Actinomycetes from the respiratory tract should be evaluated critically as their presence may represent oropharyngeal contamination.",

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is an independent predictor of both tuberculosis reactivation and suboptimal response to combination antimicrobial therapy. Hence, once the diagnosis of tuberculosis is established, every effort should be made to discontinue steroid therapy if not indicated for a specific syndrome [89] . Just as HIV-infected patients may develop clinical worsening of tuberculosis pneumonia when initiating antiretroviral therapy such as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis-related lung disease in solid organ transplant or HSCT recipients may infrequently worsen as immune function recovers following temporary discontinuation or partial withdrawal of antirejection or anti-GVHD therapy.

As invasive CMV disease often affects the transplanted allograft, lung transplant recipients are at particularly high risk of CMV pneumonitis [104] . The virus itself is immunomodulatory in nature, and CMV has been associated with bacterial and fungal superinfections as well as lymphoproliferative disorders [105, 106] .",

            "text": "Fever and nonproductive cough are prominent but nonspecific features of viral respiratory tract infection. In patients with extensive lung involvement, dyspnea may appear early in the course of infection. Viral nucleic acids in nasal washes, tracheal aspirates, and bronchial specimens are most frequently used in diagnosing viral respiratory infections through multiplex PCR platforms. Despite that, the isolation of CMV especially by PCR amplification from lower respiratory tract secretions may not necessarily indicate CMV lung infection as even in transplant recipients with severe cellular immune defects; intermittent low-level viral replication and shed virus without developing viral lung disease has been well established. Hosts' risk assessment and CMV disease susceptibility evaluation along with radiographic imaging such as non-iv-contrast chest CT scan prove helpful in discerning active viral lung disease versus nondisease associated CMV respiratory tract viral shedding. Of note, chest CT scans may show ground glass opacities even when conventional chest radiographs are unremarkable, improving the sensitivity of diagnosis. Ganciclovir or foscarnet are commonly prescribed for systemic CMV infections. In transplant recipients with CMV pneumonitis, IVIG immune modulation along with effective antiviral drug if recommended. A detailed discussion is provided regarding specific pathogens and approach towards therapeutic management of lung infections in chapters throughout this book.",
