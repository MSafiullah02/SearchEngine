Taiwanese are increasingly interested in travel to Greece. Besides, Chinese Television System released the TV series \u2018Love of the Aegean Sea\u2019 in April 2004, and a popular first prize in numerous lottery activities is now a trip to Greece or the Cycladic Islands. Lots of newly-opened stores are using Aegean Sea themes, including restaurants, motels, bed and breakfasts, and so on. Moreover, Greek or Aegean style has become popular in many areas including architecture, painting, bedspreads, food, etc. Some explanation must exist for these rapid changes, and the answer appears to be a 2003 Yahoo Anniversary Website named \u2018I left my heart in Aegean Sea\u2019 (see Fig. 1\n).",

(UMC) in Taiwan, Justin returned from the Aegean Sea and put 124 photos chosen from the 1400 pictures he took during his holiday on the website of Yahoo-Kimo in May 2003. Originally Justin simply intended to share his photos with friends, and he put them on the website because they were too large to send by e-mail. On the first day, more than 6000 visitors crowded into the website. The abnormal traffic caused Yahoo-Kimo to close the website temporarily. After Yahoo-Kimo reactivated the website, visitor levels increased to tens of thousands daily. Perhaps through a desire to share with other friends, many enthusiastic friends forwarded the beautiful website message by e-mail. For several weeks 40 to 60 thousand visitors viewed the site daily. Over one million visitors visited the website during the first month, and nearly two million visited the site over a 6 month period. Locus, a publishing company, took the opportunity to publish a photo book, 2004 desk calendar and jigsaw featuring Justin's photographs. According to Zufryden (2000), website traffic is statistically significant in predicting the box office take of a new film, and thus the publisher's action made sense and good sales volumes were achieved.",

Thus travel has become a popular leisure activity. Numerous factors influence the destination choice, including advertising campaigns by destination countries, travel agency promotions, airline ticket discounting, movies or TV programs, word of mouth, personal preferences, and so on. Various nations and regions have made considerable efforts in tourism marketing and promotion. For example, Taiwan is pushing \u2018Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan\u2019 and has designated 2004 as Taiwan Tourism Year; the Hong Kong Tourism Board has adopted the new slogan \u2018Hong Kong\u2014Live it! Love it!\u2019 as its global advertisement and has invited the famous actor, Jackie Chan, to be a travel ambassador promoting Hong Kong. All such campaigns share a common goal of attracting more overseas tourists.",

The website created by Justin is undoubtedly extremely successful in introducing Greece and the Aegean Sea to many people within a short period of time. To explore why the website appealed to so many visitors, impressing them and even leading them to plan travel to Greece is useful. The website was highly effective in place marketing, but used a different approach to those generally prescribed by marketing theory. First, the website was not built by a government agency or tourism association. Furthermore, the website did not resemble word of mouth promotion because the subject was not the tourism place itself but rather a website. These distinctions merit further study.",

Photographs provide indisputable evidence that the trip was made, that the program was carried out, that fun was had (Sontag, 1977). Moreover, photographs help to record memories. Some scholars have studied photography in tourism. Chalfen (1979) investigated the theoretical relationships between photography and tourist types. Cohen, Nir and Almogor (1992) explored stranger\u2013local interactions in tourism photography. Moreover, Markwell (1997) examined the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of photography in a nature-based tour experience. Past studies primarily focused on the impacts or roles of tourism photography, but few explored its promotional function. Photographic images of places and attractions help form expectations regarding tours during the pre-travel stage (Markwell, 1997). Therefore, photographs of scenic spots are ubiquitous, for example in travel agency or tourism bureau websites, media advertisements, guidebooks, travel brochures, postcards, and so on. The case study in this article attempts to identify the power of photographs.",

The information-intensive nature of the tourism industry suggests an important role for the Internet and Web technology in destination promotion and marketing (Doolin et al., 2002). The Web has great potential for promoting regional tourism, and is relatively inexpensive compared with other promotion and advertising media (Standing and Vasudavan, 2000). An effective website can reach global audiences, being accessible 24 h a day from anywhere in the world. Notably, Hanna and Millar (1997) reported that following the initial welcome page, photographs of destinations are the most popular website content. Website photographs thus are important in tourism marketing.",

Traditionally, nations use TV, magazines, Internet, direct mail, brochures and leaflets to conduct advertising campaigns. Additionally, they may sign contracts with other nations for exchange visits, participate in travel shows, invite overseas journalists to visit, and so on. But the key question remains successfully firing up the enthusiasm of potential tourists. \u201cI left my heart in Aegean Sea,\u201d is undoubtedly a very successful case. Simply the touching photographs accompanied by soft music could touch quite a few people and even inspire them to action. The above case provides global countries and tourism promoters with a brand-new approach to promoting tourism. This new approach is totally different from traditional approaches, but has the potential for enormous impact. All marketing personnel should move beyond traditional methods and be much more original when seeking to attract international tourists. Using non-conventional, high-impact approaches can achieve an advantage in the competitive tourism market by bringing the promoted destinations closer to their target customers.",
