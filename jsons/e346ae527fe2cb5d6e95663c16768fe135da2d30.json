Whether allergic inflammation often found with sensitization increases the susceptibility for viral infections or enhances their ability to provoke further inflammation is not entirely clear. 16 Type I interferons are important innate antiviral responses to respiratory viruses. 14, 17 There is evidence that virus-induced interferon generation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, [18] [19] [20] plasmacytoid dendritic cells, 21 and bronchial epithelial cells 22, 23 is reduced in some patients with allergic asthma (Figure 2 ). It has been show that IgE occupancy of their membrane receptors inhibits antiviral generation of IFN-a from plasmacytoid dendritic cells and may increase susceptibility to RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations ( Figure 3 ). Deficient immune responses to viral infections may be present in type 2 inflammatory conditions with interferon production being inversely correlated with increasing airway eosinophilia, IL-4 levels, and total serum IgE. 23 Finally, the use of inhaled IFN-b at the time of an upper respiratory infection reduces the airway viral load and improves clinical symptoms in patients with asthma. 24 ",

[47] [48] [49] In new onset, untreated persistent, asthma, low-dose inhaled budesonide reduces asthma exacerbations by almost 50%. 50 ICS but under poor control, 50 Pauwels et al showed that highdose budesonide further reduced severe asthma exacerbations, that is, need for systemic corticosteroids, by nearly 50% compared with treatment with low-dose ICS in adults. 50 However, as found by O'Byrne et al, 51 a doubling of the budesonide dose in patients poorly controlled on low-dose ICS also reduced exacerbation rates by 30%, but the degree of protection was less than those patients who recently started ICS. These findings indicate that dose-response benefits with ICS are relatively flat. 52 Overall, compared with placebo or a short-acting b 2 -agonist, ICS reduce clinically relevant exacerbations by nearly 55%. 53 ICS also reduce exacerbations in children 54 and are superior to a leukotriene antagonist, montelukast. 55 For patients with diminishing asthma control, quadrupling the recommended dose of ICS decreases the likelihood of an asthma exacerbation. 56 This protection does not occur with a doubling of the ICS maintenance. 57, 58 However, the benefit of using an increase in ICS is time dependent to increased symptoms and need to be started early in the course of a cold. If higher doses of ICS are used pre-emptively at the onset of a respiratory tract infection and continued for 10 days, the need for oral corticosteroids is reduced. 59 The mechanisms by which ICS prevent virus-induced exacerbations, beyond anti-inflammatory activity, are poorly understood. ICS can reduce the number of airway eosinophils that presumably reflect enhanced inflammation with a respiratory infection. 60, 61 As approximately 50% of asthma exacerbations are associated with an increase in airway eosinophils, these cells are a reasonable target. 62 This concept is substantiated by studies showing that a reduction in airway eosinophils significantly diminishes exacerbations (Figure 4) , 63, 64 but this approach does not eliminate all exacerbations, particularly for patients with more severe asthma. 65, 66 Furthermore, as airway neutrophils increase early in asthma exacerbations, 67 ICS treatment has no effect on these cells and alternative approaches will be needed. 68 ",

Consequently, the use of ICS/LABA combinations both for maintenance and symptom relief has been investigated and shown to reduce exacerbations. 72-74 These benefits are also seen in children with a prior history of severe asthma exacerbations and poorly controlled moderate-to-severe persistent asthma despite the use of moderate doses of ICS. 75 The use of ICS/LABA as maintenance and reliever treatment should be restricted to formoterol because of its quick onset of action, 76 safety profile, 77 and dose-response effect. 78 How the addition of LABA to ICS reduces asthma exacerbations remains unclear as LABA do not affect inflammation. ICS/LABA, however, attenuate allergen-induced airway eosinophilia and lung function changes to a greater extent than ICS alone. 79 Edwards et al 80 demonstrated that combination treatment synergistically suppressed induction of rhinovirusgenerated chemokines in bronchial epithelial cells. Thus, the synergistic benefits of both ICS and LABA on airway eosinophilic inflammation might explain a greater reduction in exacerbations. Alternatively, an early use of ICS/LABA for relief of symptoms might simply deliver additional ICS to the airway early in the course of an emerging exacerbation.",

The intervention group reported significantly fewer symptoms of asthma during both the intervention year and, interestingly, the follow-up year as well ( Figure 6) , with significantly fewer unscheduled asthma-related visits to the ED or clinic for the intervention group (P \u00bc .04). The correlation between the reduction in levels of cockroach allergen on the bedroom floor and asthma-related morbidity was particularly strong during the active intervention.

Prevention of exacerbations remains a major unmet need in asthma management.
