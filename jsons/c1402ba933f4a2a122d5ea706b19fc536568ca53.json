We first assessed the antiviral activity of NHC against MERS-CoV in the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 2B4 (\"Calu3\" cells). Using a recombinant MERS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC)(18), we measured virus replication in cultures exposed to a dose range of drug for 48hr. NHC was potently antiviral with an average half-maximum effective concentration (IC50) of 0.15 \u03bcM and no observed cytoxicity in similarly treated uninfected cultures across the dose range (50% cytotoxic concentration, CC50, >10 \u03bcM) (Fig. 1A) . The therapeutic index for NHC was >100. Using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020), we performed antiviral assays in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells and found NHC was potently antiviral with an IC50 of 0.3 \u03bcM and CC50 of >10 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B) . We then determined the antiviral activity of NHC against SARS-CoV-2 in the Calu-3 cells through the measurement of infectious virus production and viral genomes. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in virus titers (Fig. 1C) with an IC50 of 0.08 \u03bcM. Viral genomic RNA was quantitated in clarified supernatants by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1D) . Like the effect on infectious titers, we found a dosedependent reduction in viral genomic RNA and a similar calculated IC50 of 0.09 \u03bcM. Collectively, these data demonstrate that NHC is potently antiviral against two genetically distinct emerging CoV.",

HAE model the architecture and cellular complexity of the conducting airway and are readily infected by multiple human and zoonotic CoV, including SARS-and MERS-CoV (19) . We first assessed cytotoxicity of NHC in HAE treated with an extended dose range for 48hr using quantitative PCR of cell death-related gene transcripts as our metric. NHC treatment did not appreciably alter gene expression even at doses up to 100 \u03bcM ( fig. S1 ). We then sought to determine if NHC would inhibit clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2 replication in HAE. We observed a dose dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus production ( Fig.  2A) . In MERS-CoV infected HAE, NHC substantially reduced virus production with maximal titer reduction of > 5 logs at 10 \u03bcM (average IC50 = 0.024 \u03bcM), which correlated with reduced genomic (ORF1) and subgenomic (ORFN) RNA in paired samples (Fig. 2B) . We observed similar trends in titer reduction (> 3 log at 10 \u03bcM, average IC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM) and in copies of genomic and subgenomic RNA in SARS-CoV-infected HAE (Fig. 2C) . Thus, NHC was potently antiviral against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in primary human epithelial cell cultures without cytotoxicity.",

There is high sequence conservation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) across CoV (Fig. 3A) . For example, the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 has 99.1% similarity and 96% amino acid identity to that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3A) . To gain insight into structural conservation of RdRp across the CoV family, we modeled the variation reflected in the RdRp dendrogram in Fig. 3A onto the structure of the SARS-CoV RdRp (20) (Fig.  3B ). The core of the RdRp molecule and main structural motifs that all RdRp harbor ( Fig. 3B and fig. S2 ) are highly conserved among CoV including SARS-CoV-2. We previously reported that CoV resistance to another broad spectrum nucleoside analog, RDV, was mediated by RdRp residues F480L and V557L in a model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and in SARS-CoV, resulting in a 5-fold shift in IC50 (Fig. 3C) (21) . Consequently, we tested whether RDV resistance mutations in MHV conferred cross-resistance to NHC. In fact, the two RDV resistance mutations, alone or together, conferred increased sensitivity to inhibition by NHC (Fig. 3D) . As our previous studies have demonstrated a high genetic barrier to NHC for VEEV, influenza and CoV (14) (15) (16) , the lack of cross-resistance further suggests that NHC and RDV may select for exclusive and mutually sensitizing resistance pathways.",

Lastly, Bat-CoV HKU5 is a MERSlike beta 2c CoV (23) . NHC diminished infectious virus production and the levels of genomic/subgenomic viral RNA in HAE in a dose-dependent manner for all three Bat-CoVs (Fig.  4) . Therefore, the antiviral activity of NHC was not limited by natural amino acid variation in the RdRp, which among the group 2b and group 2c CoV can vary by almost 20%. Moreover, these data suggest that if another SARS-or MERS-like virus were to spillover into humans in the future, they would likely be susceptible to the antiviral activity of NHC.",

We sought to determine if NHC would increase the mutation frequency during MERS-CoV infection in human primary HAE. Using MERS-CoV-infected HAE treated with either vehicle or a dose range of NHC or RDV, we show that both drugs reduced virus titers in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5A) . We then used a highly-sensitive high-fidelity deep sequencing approach (Primer ID NGS), which uses barcoded degenerate primers and Illumina indexed libraries to determine accurate mutation rates on viral RNA production (25) . Using this approach, we analyzed a 538 bp region of viral genomic RNA in nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15). The error rates (#mutations/10,000 bases) in vehicle-(0.01) or RDV-(0.01) treated cultures were very low. RDV is reported to act via chain termination of nascent viral RNA, and thus the low error rates in RDV-treated cultures are in line with the proposed MOA (26) . In contrast, the error rate was significantly increased in NHC-treated MERS-CoV RNA in a dose-dependent manner (Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test; 10-fold increase at 10 \u03bcM, P < 0.0001 at 24 and 48 hpi; 5-fold increase at 1\u03bcM, P < 0.0001 at 24 hpi and P = 0.0015 at 48 hpi) (Fig. 5C) We then examined the mutational spectra induced by NHC, which can be incorporated into viral RNA as a substitution for either cytosine (C) or uracil (U). RNA-mutagenic antivirals may incorporate in both nascent negative and positive sense RNA during genome replication (Fig. 5D ). Adenine-to-guanine (A-to-G) and uracil-to-cytosine (U-to-C) transitions were enriched in MERS-CoV genomic RNA in an NHC dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5E ).

Importantly, the plasma profiles of NHC and EIDD-2801 are similar in mice following oral delivery (15) . We first performed a prophylactic dose escalation study in C57BL/6 mice where we orally administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water) or 50, 150, or 500 mg/kg EIDD-2801 2hr prior to intranasal infection with 5E+04 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (SARS-MA15), and then vehicle or drug every 12 hours thereafter. Beginning on 3 days post-infection (dpi) and through the end of the study, body weight loss compared to vehicle treatment was significantly diminished (50 mg/kg) or prevented (150, 500 mg/kg) with EIDD-2801 prophylaxis (Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test, P < 0.0001) ( fig. S3A ). Lung hemorrhage was also significantly reduced 5 dpi with 500 mg/kg EIDD-2801 treatment (Kruskal-Wallis Test, P = 0.010, fig. S3B ). Interestingly, there was a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV lung titer (median titers: 50 mg/kg = 7E+03 pfu/mL, 150 mg/kg = 2.5E+03 pfu/mL, 500 mg/kg = 50 pfu/mL, vehicle = 6.5E+04 pfu/mL) with significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparisons test) among the vehicle, 150 mg/kg (P = 0.03) and 500 mg/kg (P = 0.006) groups. Thus, prophylactic orally administered EIDD-2801 was robustly antiviral and able to prevent SARS-CoV replication and disease.",

As a control, we initiated oral vehicle or EIDD-2801 2 hours prior to infection with 1E+04 pfu SARS-MA15. For therapeutic conditions, we initiated EIDD-2801 treatment 12, 24, or 48 hours after infection. After initiating treatment, dosing for all groups was performed every 12 hours for the duration of the study. Both prophylactic treatment initiated 2 hours prior to infection and therapeutic treatment initiated 12 hours after infection significantly (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) prevented body weight loss following SARS-CoV infection on 2 dpi and thereafter (-2 hours: P = 0.0002 to <0.0001; +12 hours: P = 0.0289 to <0.0001) as compared to vehicle treated animals (Fig. 6A ). Treatment initiated 24 hpi also significantly reduced body weight loss (3-5 dpi, P = 0.01 to <0.0001) although not to the same degree as the earlier treatment initiation groups. When initiated 48 hpi, body weight loss was only different from vehicle on 4 dpi (P = 0.037, Fig. 6A ). Therapeutic EIDD-2801 significantly (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunnett's multiple comparison test) reduced lung hemorrhage when initiated up to 24 hours after infection (-2, +12, and +24 hours P < 0.0001) mirroring the body weight loss phenotypes (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, all EIDD-2801 treated mice had significantly (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunnett's multiple comparison test) reduced viral loads in the lungs even in the +48 hours group (All P < 0.0001, Fig. 6C ), which experienced the least protection from body weight loss and lung hemorrhage. We also measured pulmonary function via whole body plethysmography (WBP). In Fig. 6D , we show the WBP enhanced pause (PenH) metric, which is a surrogate marker for bronchoconstriction or pulmonary obstruction (27) , was significantly (Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test) improved throughout the course of the study if treatment was initiated up to 12 hours after infection (-2 hours: 2d pi to 5 dpi, P < 0.0001 to 0.019, +12 hours: 2 dpi to 5 dpi, P < 0.0001 to 0.0192) although the +24 hours group showed sporadic improvement as well (3 dpi P = 0.002) (Fig.  6D ). Lastly, we blindly evaluated hematoxylin and eosinstained lung tissue sections for histological features of ALI using two different and complementary scoring tools (18) , which show that treatment initiated up to +12 hours significantly reduced ALI (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparison test) (American Thoracic Society (ATS) Lung Injury Score: -2 hours P = 0.0004, +12 hours P = 0.0053, Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) Score: -2 hours P = 0.0015, +12 hours P = 0.0004, Fig. 6E ). Altogether, therapeutic EIDD-2801 was potently antiviral against SARS-CoV in vivo but the degree of clinical benefit was dependent on the time of initiation postinfection.",

As the murine ortholog of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), does not support viral binding and entry, all in vivo studies were performed in genetically modified mice encoding a murine DPP4 receptor encoding two human residues at positions 288 and 330 (hDPP4 288/330 mice) (18, 28) . Similar to our SARS-CoV data, S4 ). We then evaluated the therapeutic efficacy EIDD-2801 following the promising results of our prophylactic studies. Similar to our SARS-CoV study, EIDD-2801 treatment administered before or 12 hours after intranasal mouseadapted MERS-CoV infection (5E+04 PFU) prevented body weight loss from 2 through 6 dpi (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test, Fig. 7A , P = 0.02 to <0.0001) and lung hemorrhage on 6 dpi (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparison test, P = 0.0004 to < 0.0001, Fig.  7B ), but treatment initiated 24 or 48 hours did not offer similar protection. Unlike body weight loss and lung hemorrhage data which varied by treatment initiation time, virus lung titer on 6 dpi was significantly reduced to the limit of detection in all treatment groups (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparison test, Fig. 7C , P < 0.0001). Interestingly, when viral genomic RNA was quantified in paired samples of lung tissue, EIDD-2801 significantly reduced quantities of viral RNA (One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test, P <0.0001 to 0.017) in an initiation time-dependent manner for all groups except for +48 hours (Fig. 7D ). The discrepancy among infectious titers and viral RNA suggests that accumulated mutations render the particles non-infectious and undetectable by plaque assay, consistent with the MOA. To gauge the effect of EIDD-2801 treatment on lung function, we assessed pulmonary function by WBP. Mirroring the body weight loss data, normal pulmonary function was only observed in groups where treatment was initiated prior to or 12 hours after infection (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test, -2hr: P < 0.0001 3 dpi, P = 0.0002 4 dpi, +12hr: P < 0.0001 3 dpi, P = 0.0008 4 dpi, Fig. 7E ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that NHC prodrug, EIDD-2801, robustly reduces MERS-CoV infectious titers, viral RNA, and pathogenesis under both prophylactic and early therapeutic conditions.",

            "text": "To study the molecular mechanisms associated with drug performance in vivo, we investigated the correlation between infectious virus production and EIDD-2801-mediated mutagenesis of MERS-CoV RNA under therapeutic treatment conditions. Using Primer ID NGS, we measured the mutation rates of both viral genomic RNA (non-structural protein 10, nsp10) and host interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) mRNA, a highly up-regulated innate immune-related gene after MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 7F (25) . Viral TCS were significantly reduced (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test, -2 hours P <0.0001, +12 hours P = 0.0001, +24 hours P = 0.02) in a treatment initiation time-dependent manner ( Fig. 7G ) similar to viral genomic RNA measured by qRT-PCR. In contrast, the numbers of ISG15 TCS were similar (P = 0.2 to 0.8) for all groups indicating that neither vehicle nor drug treatment significantly affected the levels of or mutated ISG15 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 7G ). Similar to our TCS data in Fig. 6G , the total error rate in viral nsp10 was significantly increased (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) in groups where treatment was initiated prior to (-2 hours, median error rate = 10.5 errors/10,000 bases, P < 0.0001) and up to 24 hours post infection (12 hours, median error rate = 8.2 errors/10,000 bases, P < 0.0001 ; +24 hours, median error rate = 5.4 errors/10,000 bases, P = 0.0003) but the error rates in ISG15 remained at baseline for all groups (Fig. 7H ). In addition, nucleotide transitions observed in MERS-CoV genomes in vitro, were also observed in vivo in groups where treatment was initiated prior to and up to 12 hours post infection (Twoway ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test, P = 0.0003 to < 0.0001) (Fig. 7I ). Importantly, these transitions were not observed in host ISG15 mRNA (Fig. 7I) . Lastly, the EIDD-2801 dose-dependent mutagenesis of viral RNA correlated with an increase in codon change frequency, including stop codons, in mice where treatment was initiated 12 hours or before (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test, vehicle median = 3.4; -2hr median = 22.8, P = 0.0035; +12 hours median = 20.0, P = 0.0004, Fig. 7J ). Thus, approximately 20% of the mutations observed in the -2 hours and +12 hours groups resulted in a codon change and alteration of the nsp10 protein sequence. When extrapolating our results from nsp10 to the entirety of the 30kb MERS-CoV genome, EIDD-2801 likely causes between 15 (+24 hours treatment) and 30 (-2 hours treatment) mutations per genome, 10-20% of which result in amino acid coding changes. Altogether, our data demonstrates that EIDD-2801-driven mutagenesis correlates well with the reductions in viral load, strongly suggestive of an error catastrophe-driven mechanism of action under therapeutic conditions.",

            "text": "In the past 20 years, three novel human coronaviruses have emerged (29, 30) . The group 2b SARS-like CoV represent an existential and future threat to global health as evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Zoonotic SARS-like bat CoV strains can use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, grow well in primary human airway cells, and vary by as much as 25% in key therapeutic and vaccine gene targets (11, 31) . Thus, to address the current public health emergency of COVID-19 and to maximize pandemic preparedness in the future, broad-based vaccines and therapeutics, which are active against the higher risk RNA virus families prone to emergence, are desperately needed. Small molecule antivirals can exert their antiviral effect through multiple mechanisms including blocking viral entry, inhibiting a virally encoded enzyme, blocking virus particle formation, or targeting a host factor required for replication (32) . Multiple direct acting antivirals are currently under evaluation in randomized control trials to treat COVID-19 including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir (33) (34) (35) . Here, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of NHC and its orally bioavailable prodrug EIDD-2801, against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the current pandemic strain SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelial cells. In addition to CoV, NHC is broadly active against multiple genetically distinct viruses including VEE, influenza A and B, Ebola, and Chikungunya viruses (13-16, 19, 21, 24, 36-38) . Here, we show that prophylactic and therapeutic EIDD-2801 significantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in mouse models of both SARS-and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Although the improvement in both SARSand MERS-CoV outcomes diminished with the delay of treatment initiation time, it is important to note that the kinetics of disease in mice are compressed as compared to that in humans. Whereas SARS-and MERS-CoV lung titers peak on 1-2 dpi in mice concurrent with the onset of clinical signs and notable damage to the lung epithelium, in humans this occurs 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms (19, 28, 39, 40) . Thus, in mice, the window within which to treat emerging CoV infection prior to peak replication is compressed (e.g., 24-48 hours). As with oseltamivir treatment for influenza which fails to provide a protective effect if administered >5 days after the onset of symptoms, the window in which to treat COVID-19 patients prior to peak virus replication is likely during the first week of symptoms when pharyngeal shedding is at its highest (41, 42) . However, virus replication and shedding may continue for several weeks in the most severe COVID-19 patients (34) . Thus, early intervention with an antiviral like EIDD-2801 is likely to provide the most clinical benefit although there may opportunities in severe patients where the duration of virus replication may be extended. Our current study is clearly limited by the lack of in vivo efficacy testing with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, robust mouse models that recapitulate the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis observed in humans do not yet exist due to a noted virus spike glycoprotein and mouse ACE2 receptor incompatibility complicating the evaluation of medical countermeasures (43, 44) . In addition, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity increases with increasing age. Our studies are limited by the lack of drug efficacy testing in CoV aged mouse models that recapitulate the age-related increase in pathogenesis observed in humans (45) . The data provided in this manuscript suggest that EIDD-2801 should be quickly evaluated in primate models of human disease, using immediate models for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pathogenesis or newly described cynomolgus and rhesus macaque models for SARS-CoV-2 (46) (47) (48) (49) .",

            "text": "For VEE and influenza, NHC/EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leading to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that surpasses the error threshold allowed to sustain a virus population (14, 15) . This process occurs when NHC is incorporated during RNA synthesis then subsequently misread thus increasing mutation rates. Therefore, for CoV, the NHC MOA would appear less likely to be affected by the RNA proofreading activity encoded by the nsp14 exonuclease function that otherwise limits misincorperation (50) . Here, we present data using Primer ID NGS to quantitate the frequency and identity of the mutational spectra in the MERS-CoV genome in both drug-treated primary human airway cells and in mice at single genome resolution. As CoV are positive sense RNA viruses that replicate through a negative sense RNA intermediate, NHC incorporation as a C or a U can occur in both polarities of RNA. We found increased nucleotide transitions (A to G, G to A, C to U, U to C) consistent with those reported after influenza and VEE infections (14, 15) . Under identical conditions, RDV did not alter the mutation rate in MERS-CoV genomic RNA, supporting its reported mechanism of action as a chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis (26) . In primary human lung cell cultures and mice infected with MERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely correlated with a reduction in infectious virus. In addition, we found a positive correlation between increased mutation rates and the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations and the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. To explore the potential off-target effect in host mRNA which may contribute to drug toxicity, we also examined the impact of NHC treatment on ISG15 transcripts, a gene highly induced following MERS-CoV infection. Although ISG15 transcripts are present in great abundance, an accumulation of mutations was not observed in ISG15 in this model even at 500 mg/kg dosing. These data also support previous studies using RNAseq to demonstrate that the model coronavirus MHV displayed increased mutation frequencies following NHC treatment in vitro (16) . With regard to nucleic acid specificity, ribonucleotides are efficiently removed from eukaryotic cell DNA; therefore, treating a viral infection with a mutagenic ribonucleoside analog should show a selectivity for incorporation into the viral genome and not be efficient at being incorporated into and inducing mutations into host cell DNA (51) . All together, these data strongly support the notion that EIDD-2801 and its active nucleoside analog NHC exert their antiviral effect through the induction of error catastrophe in the targeted virus. While our data suggest that the MERS-CoV nsp14 proofreading activity appeared ineffective against NHC in vitro and EIDD-2801 in vivo, future studies should investigate the antiviral activity of NHC in the presence or absence of the nsp14 proofreading activity, as loss of this activity increased the sensitivity of MHV and SARS-CoV replication to RDV treatment (50) .",

Coupling cell lines and primary HAE cell cultures, we evaluated the antiviral activity of NHC against the three most recently emerged human CoV: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the data presented for HAE studies are representative of those from 2-3 separate human donors. For SARS-CoV-2, the HAE were from a single human donor. We evaluated drug cytotoxicity in both Calu-3 2B4 and HAE cell cultures. Calu-3 and the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV HAE studies were performed in biological triplicate. HAE studies with SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-and MERS-like bat CoV were performed with two wells per condition. Drug effects were measured relative to vehicle controls in vitro and comparisons in vivo were performed to vehicle controls. We also aimed to determine the antiviral efficacy of EIDD-2801 in mouse models of CoV pathogenesis. These studies were intended to provide the preclinical data to justify nonhuman primate studies and human clinical trials. Mice were age-and sex-matched and randomly assigned into groups before infection and treatment. Pathology was scored blinded by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.

We designed cDNA primers targeting multiple regions on the viral genome and murine mRNA, each with a block of random (table S2) . Viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp viral RNA kit. A preamplification titration of templates was performed to estimate the amount of template to use. We used SuperScript III to make cDNA with multiplexed cDNA primers based on the regions to be sequenced. We used 41R_PID11 for the pilot sequencing and titration determination. For the MERS-CoV sequencing, we multiplexed nsp10_PID11, nsp12_PID11 and nsp14_PID11 for the cDNA reaction; for the murine mRNA sequencing, we used mixed primers of nsp10_PID11, ifit3_PID11, isg15_PID11. After bead purification, we amplified the cDNA with a mixture of forward primers (based on the described schemes) and a universal reverse primer, followed by another round of PCR to incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and barcodes in the amplicons.

For SARS-CoV, in cohorts of equivalent numbers of male and female 20-29 week old SPF C57BL/6J (Stock 000664 Jackson Labs) mice (n = 10/dose group), we administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water) or 50, 150 or 500 mg/kg EIDD-2801 by oral gavage 2 hours prior to intranasal infection with 1E+04 PFU mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strain MA15 in 50\u03bcl. Mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine prior to intranasal infection. Vehicle or drug was administered every 12hr for the remainder of the study. Body weight and pulmonary function by whole body plethysmography were measured daily.

Briefly, 500,000 Vero E6 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates. The following day, medium was removed and serial dilutions of clarified lung homogenate were added per plate (10 \u22121 to 10 \u22126 dilutions) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1hr after which wells were overlaid with 1X DMEM, 5% Fetal Clone 2 serum, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 0.8% agarose. Two days after, plaques were enumerated to generate a plaque/ml value. Lung hemorrhage is a gross pathological phenotype readily observed by the naked eye driven by the degree of virus replication where the coloration of the lung changes from pink to dark red (62, 63) .

To obtain a lung injury score per field, the scores for A-E were then put into the following formula, which contains multipliers that assign varying levels of importance for each phenotype of the disease state.: score = [(20x A) + (14 x B) + (7 x C) + (7 x D) + (2 x E)]/100. The scores for the three fields per mouse were averaged to obtain a final score ranging from 0 to and including 1.",
