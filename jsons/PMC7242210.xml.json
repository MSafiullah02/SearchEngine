He had no symptoms of COVID-19 and was doing well. He arrived in the United Arab Emirates from Italy on February 21. He denied any fever, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or malaise. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. On admission he was found to have a fever of 38.9 \u00b0C, with a blood pressure 142/94 mm/Hg, pulse 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% when breathing ambient air. Both lungs were clear on auscultation and the remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory results revealed thrombocytopenia, with a lymphocyte count of 0.90 (1.50 - 4.00) cells/\u00b5L. His inflammatory markers were elevated, with C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28.1 (0\u20135) mg/L. Liver function and renal function were within the normal range. The respiratory virus panel (BioFire, FilmArray, bioM\u00e9rieux, Salt Lake City, UT) was negative for influenza A and B as well as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV). A chest X-ray done on admission revealed infrahilar infiltrates.",

His QTc interval at baseline and on follow-up were normal. On March 6 (hospital day 6), his chest X-ray showed worsening infiltrates and he had persistent fever and worsening lymphopenia. Favipiravir was added to his regimen at a loading dose of 1,600 mg orally every 12 hours, followed by 600 mg orally every 8 hours, and hydroxychloroquine was discontinued. He continued to have daily fever (maximum temperature 39.8 \u00b0C), and on March 9 he developed a dry cough and his oxygen saturation decreased to 90% when breathing ambient air. His CRP increased to 84.3 mg/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan on March 9 showed diffuse bilateral confluent and patchy ground glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities in both lungs, predominantly in right upper and left lower lobes. A sputum culture with gram stain as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus nasal swab were collected, and an empiric antibacterial regimen of cefepime and intravenous vancomycin was initiated to cover a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.",

Type 1 interferon (IFN-1) is among the first cytokines produced during a viral infection and is involved in inflammation, signaling and immunomodulation [9]. It interferes with viral replication and plays a major role in antiviral immunity [9]. Interferons have been extensively studied for their activity against coronavirus in cell culture, animal models, and clinical studies [9]. While the Type I interferons (alpha and beta) are the most studied, there have been several studies of the Type II (gamma) and III (lambda) interferons [10,11]. Interferon beta was found to be the most potent interferon subtype in various in vitro studies conducted in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [10,12,13].",

The trial compared the outcomes of patients who received nebulized interferon alfa-2b or umifenovir monotherapy, versus combination of interferon alfa-2b with umifenovir. The study investigators showed that patients who received interferon therapy experienced more rapid viral clearance compared to those treated with umifenovir alone. The retrospective design of this study in addition to an imbalance in patient demographics at baseline (patients on umifenovir monotherapy were older, had more co-morbidities and presented for admission later in course of their disease) makes it difficult to extrapolate data to a broader patient population. Despite these limitations, this study presents some evidence of the role of interferon in the management of COVID-19 that could be corroborated in future clinical trials [19].",

This could be due to the fact that they only only received 1 or 2 doses, which may not have been sufficient to elicit the toxic side effects usually observed with prolonged pegylated interferon alfa 2a therapy (including hepatoxicity, bone marrow suppression and neuropsychiatric side effects).",
