The following pairs of kittens were litter mates and resident within the same pen: kittens Z\u2010FIP and #80; #65 and #73; #66 and #75. Otherwise the kittens were housed in separate pens within the same complex.

In each case, the diagnosis of FIP is supported by the amplification of FCoV RNA from their respective tissue or ascitic fluid samples. Unfortunately, the true incidence of FIP was unknown because of the high throughput of cats within the center and minimal available follow\u2010up data. Of the 16 fecal samples collected from contemporaneous asymptomatic cats, 9 (56%) contained FCoV RNA. This is similar to what was found in a study that identified FCoV shedding in 60% of cats 1 week after arriving at a rescue shelter.18 More than 1 year postsampling, 5 of the 9 contemporaneous asymptomatic cats remain alive and without any signs that could be suggestive of FIP over 1 year postsampling. We therefore suggest that these isolates can, with some certainty, be considered as feline enteric coronavirus infections based on their biological behavior. However, as noted, four of the contemporaneous asymptomatic cats were euthanized subsequently. Two of these cats were euthanized at the rehoming center with nonspecific clinical signs; the other 2 cats had developed signs potentially consistent with FIP (eg, malaise, abdominal fluid) after rehoming to new owners and had been euthanized (postmortem samples were not available). Consequently, we are unable to assign the samples from these animals to the FIP or nonFIP groups. This illustrates the caution needed during sample collection but does not invalidate the conclusions of this study.",

This was true for all of the phylogenetic trees generated for each of the genome fragments, (Fig 2A\u2013D). Thus, this study provides no evidence for the presence of 2 distinct FIP tissue\u2010associated and fecally derived strains of FCoV in the cats associated with this FIP outbreak.",

NP058427) was predicted for all of the viruses that we analyzed. This motif arrangement was not one of the amino acid combinations (YIIAL associated with FIP; HIIVI/HIIVL/HVIAL/YVVAL associated with asymptomatic cats; and YIVAL seen in association with both FIP and asymptomatic cats), suggested in the original article.6 Also, the YVIAL motif has been reported subsequently in both FIP\u2010associated FCoVs and fecally\u2010derived FCoVs.8 Moreover, in this study there were no RNA or amino acid motifs identified, in any of the gene fragments, which were associated with any specific disease phenotype. It has to be noted that this study, as with previous phylogenetic analyzes of FCoV genomes, was limited by only partial genome coverage (approximately 16%). Future study involving whole genome sequencing will be needed to identify any specific virus determinant associated with the development of FIP.",
