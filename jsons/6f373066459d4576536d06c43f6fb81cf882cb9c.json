In New York, hospitals rapidly phased out elective surgeries, allowing for emergent cases only, and were mandated to increase their bed capacity, emphasizing ICU-level care. 2, 3 The specialist's role in achieving these goals, however, is not clear. Triage of cases into elective, urgent, and emergent is not straightforward, and it must balance the best care for each patient as an individual with the greater good in this public health crisis.

Handoffs between teams were performed via videoconference, with each team isolated from the others to contain transmission. The added benefit of this schedule was that each team was off for 12 days between calls, so an approximate 2-week \"quarantine\" would be practiced-which was of particular importance given the lengthy incubation period of COVID-19. 12 This iteration required the full resident contingent and was, consequently, short-lived, as our hospital and New York State Department of Health required health care workers to be reassigned to the care of the increasing number of COVID-19 patients.
