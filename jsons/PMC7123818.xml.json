Physiologic changes in pregnancy, including ureteral dilatation, increased bladder volume, decreased bladder, and ureteral tone, all contribute to urinary stasis and can lead to urinary tract infections (UTI) [1]. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in up to 9 % of pregnant woman and can lead to a symptomatic urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis in 30\u201340 % of patients if left untreated [2]. Cystitis and pyelonephritis can occur in up to 2 % of pregnancies [3]. Because of the increased risk of UTI in pregnancy, the higher likelihood of progression to upper tract disease, and association with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight infants, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and appropriate treatment and management of cystitis and pyelonephritis are important for both mother and baby [4].",

For asymptomatic women, bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive voided urine specimens with isolation of the same bacterial strain in quantitative counts \u2265105 cfu/mL in culture. However, in clinical practice one midstream, clean catch specimen with the above criteria would be considered positive and should be treated in the pregnant patient. Because of an increased risk of complications, the IDSA recommends routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria at least once in early pregnancy with a urine culture and treatment if results are positive. This recommendation is based on the increased risk of progression to a symptomatic urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis in 30\u201340 % of patients. In addition, it is known that antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is associated with a significant decreased risk of both pyelonephritis and the frequency of low birth weight infants and preterm delivery [5\u20137]. The exact timing of screening does vary based on organization. The IDSA recommends a urine culture in \u201cearly pregnancy.\u201d The US Preventative Services Task Force and The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommend screening with a urine culture between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit [8]. In general, rescreening later in pregnancy is not warranted in low-risk patients.",

The presence of dysuria, urgency, and increased urinary frequency should make one consider a diagnosis of UTI. The addition of fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness on exam should raise the suspicion for pyelonephritis. As the above, a urine culture should be sent with \u2265105 cfu/mL, the accepted standard for significant bacteriuria. However, lower colony counts such as 103 cfu/mL in symptomatic patients with a UTI can occur. Pyuria with >10 leukocytes/microL, hematuria, and a positive nitrite test may also be seen on urinalysis in the setting of a UTI or pyelonephritis. However, it is of increased importance to send a urine culture as well as this can help guide antibiotic choice which is more limited in the pregnant patient. In this case, the initial presentation, urinalysis, and culture support the diagnosis of cystitis. The development of nausea, back pain, and fever is consistent with pyelonephritis and likely occurred due to antibiotic resistance to the initial antibiotic prescribed.",

Other pathogens include Proteus mirabilis, group B Streptococcus (GBS), and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. GBS vaginal colonization is associated with preterm rupture of membranes, preterm labor, and neonatal sepsis. However, it can also be a cause of UTI in approximately 5 % of patients [1]. One randomized clinical trial found a significant reduction in rates of premature rupture of membranes and preterm delivery in women with GBS bacteriuria who were treated with penicillin when compared to placebo [9]. Whether GBS bacteriuria is equivalent to GBS vaginal colonization is unclear. However, if GBS bacteriuria is seen at any point in the pregnancy prophylactic antibiotics during labor is recommended.",

As with all urinary tract infections, management should be tailored to the organism and susceptibility pattern seen on culture. In pregnancy, attention must also be paid to the safety of the antimicrobial depending on the stage of pregnancy. Antibiotics frequently used include nitrofurantoin, beta-lactams, cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin. A short course of antibiotics (3\u20137 days) is frequently used although the optimal duration of antibiotics for ASB is unclear. A Cochrane systematic review of 13 studies found a trend to lower rate of bacterial clearance in patients treated with a single-dose regimen when compared to short course (4\u20137 days) [15]. One antibiotic, fosfomycin, however, has been shown in a single dose to have equivalent rates of cure to 7-day courses of other antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin [16]. Unfortunately, up to 30 % of women can fail to clear their bacteriuria after a course of antibiotics [3]. Because of this, it is recommended to repeat a urine culture shortly after treatment to document clearance and periodically throughout the pregnancy [2].\n",

Syphilis can be classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary, based on initial symptom presentation. If asymptomatic (latent), it can be divided into early (less than 1 year since negative titers) or late (more than 1 year). Screening tests for syphilis are traditionally non-treponemal specific and include RPR (rapid plasma reaction) and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory). Positive non-treponemal testing should be followed by confirmatory treponemal testing such as TPPA (T. pallidum particle agglutination assay) or FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption). If treponemal testing is negative, this may represent a transient biological false positive which can occur in pregnancy.",

This normally occurs about 2\u20134 weeks postexposure and heals spontaneously. Treatment is benzathine penicillin G (BPG) 2.4 million units intramuscularly once. Secondary syphilis can have a broad range of systemic symptoms including rash that involves palms and soles, headache, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. It occurs about 2\u20138 weeks post resolution of the initial chancre. Treatment is identical to primary syphilis. The hallmark of tertiary syphilis is the formation of gummas (granulomatous lesions). These can occur anywhere but typical lesions involve the heart or large vessels and the central nervous system. Treatment for tertiary syphilis is with BPG 2.4 million units intramuscularly weekly for 3 weeks. If neurosyphilis is suspected, a 10- to 14-day course with aqueous penicillin G 18\u201324 million units IV is recommended.",

Treatment with a single injection of BPG as the above is acceptable for primary, secondary, as well as early latent syphilis if clear documentation of negative testing within a year is available. Some experts recommend a second dose of benzathine penicillin G 1 week later in pregnant patients especially in the third trimester tertiary, and late latent syphilis requires weekly penicillin injection for three doses.

The rash occurs less frequently in adults and symptoms can mimic a mild cold or even be asymptomatic. For most adults, a symmetric polyarthralgia is one of the most common symptoms and can last weeks to months. The illness in immunocompetent adults and children is typically self-limited, but as discussed below, pregnant women are at risk for fetal complications. The varying presentation of parvovirus B19 in mother and baby can be seen in Table 3. The incubation period is 13\u201318 days, and the infectivity differs from other rash illnesses in that an infected individual is contagious before the onset of symptoms. This makes prevention of the illness in susceptible or high-risk hosts especially challenging.\n",

This occurs as a result of the B19 virus\u2019 infection of erythroid precursor cells and inhibition of hematopoiesis. Binding sites are found on erythrocytes, but also synovium, placental tissue, fetal myocardium, and endothelial cells. Severe anemia in the fetus can lead to high-output heart failure and hydrops fetalis as seen by ascites, cardiomegaly, and pericardial effusion on ultrasound exam [43]. Fortunately, this does not occur as often as initially thought. Gratac\u00f3s et al. prospectively studied 1610 pregnant women in Spain who were <28 weeks pregnant at enrollment. The prevalence of IgG positivity was 35 %. The incidence of acute parvovirus infection during pregnancy was 3.7 %. The incidence of fetal loss due to parvovirus in this large study was 1.66 %. The remaining pregnancies were uneventful, and the 1-year follow-up of infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy showed no serious abnormalities [44].",

The observed rate of fetal death was 6.3 %, and death was only observed when B19 infection occurred during the first 20 weeks of gestation. There were six stillbirths, four of which were attributed to B19 infection within the first 20 weeks. This study demonstrated the B19 associated risk of fetal death which was largely confined to the first 20 weeks of gestation. The overall risk of hydrops fetalis in this study was 3.9 %. As with fetal death, hydrops was seen more often when infection occurred earlier in pregnancy (\u226432 weeks). A reduced incidence of fetal death with initiation of intrauterine transfusions (IUT) in cases of hydrops fetalis was also seen in this study. The proportion of fetuses that survived after receiving IUT was 11/13 (84.6 %). All of the non-transfused fetuses with severe hydrops died [2]. Although parvovirus appears to be teratogenic in some animals, and some case reports have suggested a link between parvovirus infection during pregnancy and congenital malformations, this has not been supported by epidemiologic and long-term studies [45, 46]. One retrospective study by Rodis et al. looked at outcomes of approximately 110 women up to 7 years after acute parvovirus infection during pregnancy and found no increase in the frequency of developmental delays in children with exposure in utero compared to women with known immunity to parvovirus. In summary, although vertical transmission in pregnancy can occur relatively commonly, adverse fetal effects remain a rare complication in a minority of fetuses.",

In the setting of compatible symptoms or a possible exposure to parvovirus, the pregnant woman should be assessed to determine whether she is susceptible to infection or is currently infected. The diagnosis relies primarily on IgM and IgG antibodies, but polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be helpful in certain situations. The sensitivity of parvovirus B19 IgM is between 80 and 90 % and can be seen approximately 10 days after an exposure which is typically right before symptom onset [47]. B19 IgG antibodies develop a few days after IgM antibodies and usually persist for life. The diagnosis and initial management of a pregnant patient with symptoms concerning for parvovirus or with a known exposure is seen in Fig. 6. An isolated positive IgG would suggest prior infection and current immunity with no risk for the fetus. An isolated positive IgM or an IgM and IgG antibody is consistent with a recent infection, and an ultrasound examination should be performed to look for evidence of severe anemia or hydrops fetalis. Serial ultrasounds are typically performed every 1\u20132 weeks for up to 12 weeks after infection. Ultrasound examinations should include Doppler measurement of the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity which has been shown to be a sensitive sign for identifying fetal anemia. Signs of hydrops fetalis include scalp edema, ascites, polyhydramnios, and cardiomegaly [41, 43, 48].\n",

Burgdorferi was reported by Shirts et al. in a 27-year-old woman who presented with fever in the third trimester. The infant was delivered at 34 weeks via cesarean section for non-reassuring fetal status and the mother received cefamandole. Infant complications included hyperbilirubinemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and rash. A Borrelia-like spirochete was seen on peripheral blood smear from the infant and in the lumen of the placental cord vessels. The infant did well following ampicillin treatment [56]. Schlesinger et al. later reported another case of transplacental transmission of B. burgdorferi in a woman who developed an EM rash in her first trimester but was not treated. The infant born at 35 weeks died within 2 days of birth and was found to have multiple cardiac defects. Postmortem examination did reveal spirochetes in multiple organ systems in the infant [55].",

However, clinical, serological, and epidemiological studies have failed to demonstrate a definite causal association between infection in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes [58\u201360]. In one of the largest prospective studies to date, Strobino et al. looked at over 2000 pregnant women in Westchester County, New York, an area with high endemnicity for Lyme disease. They collected clinical questionnaires and Lyme serologies at the first prenatal visit and delivery. They found that maternal exposure to Lyme disease before conception or during pregnancy was not associated with fetal death, congenital malformations, or prematurity [59]. This same author also found no association between congenital heart defect and maternal tick bite or maternal Lyme disease within 3 months of conception or during pregnancy in a retrospective case-control study [61].

The management of pregnant woman with Lyme disease differs only in that doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and possible effect on fetal bone formation. In this patient with early, localized Lyme disease, amoxicillin 500 mg three times per day for 14\u201321 days would be appropriate. In cases where parental therapy is preferred such as neurologic abnormalities, and some cardiac conditions including high-degree AV block, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice in nonpregnant and pregnant patients alike. It is important to know that Ixodes ticks can be co-infected and transmit Lyme in addition to other pathogens such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. If symptoms are not compatible with Lyme disease after a tick bite or symptoms fail to resolve after appropriate antibiotic therapy, these co-infections should be considered [62]. Amoxicillin, which would be used to treat early Lyme disease in pregnant patients, is not effective against either Anaplasma or Babesia, and further investigation and alternative therapies would need to be explored.\n",

In this case, a tick bite was not recognized, but if it had been, prophylaxis would not be recommended. This is because of risks of doxycycline in pregnancy, in combination with the lack of data to support short courses of amoxicillin as a prophylactic regimen, and the excellent efficacy of antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease if infection does develop [50]. Since prophylaxis in pregnancy is not a recommended prevention of Lyme disease with avoidance of possible exposure, the use of tick repellents, such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), and early removal of ticks remain important tools to reduce infection rates [63].",
