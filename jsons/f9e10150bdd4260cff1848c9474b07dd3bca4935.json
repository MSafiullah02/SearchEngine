Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 \u00b5M. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M pro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 \u00c5 resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by M pro . Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.",

Compounds that target anyone of these viral proteins might be potential antiviral drug candidates. 7, 8 In this study, we focus on the viral 3CL protease, also called the main protease (M pro ), and aim to develop potent M pro inhibitors as SAR-CoV-2 antivirals. The M pro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high profile target for antiviral drug discovery. 9-12 The M pro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln\uf024(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases, suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral M pro . As such, we developed the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we report our findings of several novel hits targeting SARS-CoV-2 M pro and their mechanism of action. The in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Overall, our study provides a list of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 with a confirmed mechanism of action, and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in combating COVID-19. The compounds identified herein represent one of the most potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity. 9, 11, 12 The X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with GC-376 showed that the compound can adapt two configurations R and S, offering a molecular explanation of the highbinding affinity of the aldehyde-containing inhibitors. Significantly, the discovery of calpain II and XII inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals suggest that it might be feasible to design dual inhibitors against the viral M pro and the host calpains, both of which are important for viral replication.",

We found that M pro displays highest activity in pH 6.5 buffer (Fig. 1B) , which contains 20 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol. As such, all the following proteolytic assay was conducted using this pH 6.5 buffer. Next, we characterized the enzymatic activity of this With the established FRET assay condition, we screened a collection of protease inhibitors from the Selleckchem bioactive compound library to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors. The protease inhibitors are grouped based on their targets and mechanism of action and include proteasome inhibitors (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) ; HIV protease inhibitors (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) ; \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) ; HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) ; DPP-4 inhibitors (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) ; miscellaneous serine protease inhibitors (36) (37) (38) (39) ; cathepsin and calpain protease inhibitors (40) (41) (42) (43) ; miscellaneous cysteine protease inhibitors (44-48); matrix metalloprotease inhibitors (49-51); and miscellaneous protease inhibitors (52-55). The inhibitors were pre-incubated with 100 nM of M pro at 30 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in the presence of 4 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) before the addition of 10 \u00b5M FRET substrate.",

We also included two well-known viral 3CL protease inhibitors GC-376 (64) and rupintrivir (65) in the secondary screening. GC-376 (64) is an investigational veterinary drug that is being developed for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 13, 14 GC-376 (64) was designed to target the viral 3CL protease and had potent antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS, FIPV, and norovirus. 13, 15 Rupintrivir (65) was developed as a rhinovirus antiviral by targeting the viral 3CL protease, but it was discontinued in clinical trials due to side effects. 16 In our study, we found that GC-376 (64) was the most potent M pro inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.03 \u00b5M. It shifted the melting curve of M pro by 18.30 o C upon binding. In contrast, rupintrivir (65) was not active against M pro (IC50 > 20 \u00b5M). Previous report also showed that rupintrivir was not active against the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (M pro ) (IC50 > 100 \u00b5M). 17 Both compounds 64 and 65 were not active against the EV-A71 2A protease, but showed potent inhibition against the EV-A71 3C protease, which is consistent with previously reported results. 15, 18, 19 When plotting the IC50 values (log scale) of the inhibitors against M pro from the FRET enzymatic assay with the melting temperature shifts (\u0394Tm) from thermal shift binding assay (Fig.   3A ), a linear correlation was observed, and the r 2 of the linear regression fitting is 0.94. This suggests that there is a direct correlation between the enzymatic inhibition and protein binding: a more potent enzyme inhibitor also binds to the protein with higher affinity. The stabilization of the M pro against thermal denaturation was also compound concentration dependent (Fig. 3B ).",

With the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists and researchers around the globe are racing to find effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. 7 The viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir holds the greatest promise and it is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials. 35, 36 The HIV drug combination lopinavir and ritonavir recently failed in a clinical trial for COVID-19 with no significant therapeutic efficacy was observed. 37 To address this unmet medical need, we initiated a drug repurposing screening to identify potent inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M pro from a collection of FDA-approved protease inhibitors. The M pro has been shown to be a validated antiviral drug target for SARS and MERS. 38 As the SARS-CoV-2 M pro shares a high sequence similarity with SARS and to a less extent with MERS, we reasoned that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro will similarly prevent viral replication. 9, 11 Noticeable findings from our study include: 1) Boceprevir ( All potent SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors contain reactive warheads such as \u03b1-ketoamide (boceprevir (28), calpain inhibitor XII (62)) or aldehyde (MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitor II (61)) or aldehyde prodrug, the bisulfite (GC-376 (64)). This result suggests that reactive warheads might be essential for SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibition. The compounds identified in this study represent one of the most potent and selective hits reported so far, and are superior than recently reported SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors ebselen, N3, and 13b (Table 3) . Calpain inhibitor XII (62) had similar potency as the recently disclosed compounds 11a and 11b (Table 3) . 12 Notably, calpain inhibitor II (61) and XII (62) have different chemical scaffolds as GC-376 (64), N3, 13b, 11a, and 11b, therefore providing new opportunities for designing more potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors.",

The configurations of G-C376 (64) were consistent in protomers A and B, where the thioacetal hydroxide is positioned in the \"oxyanion hole\" formed by the backbone amides of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 (Figs. 5A & S3), resulting in the (S)-configuration. It is noted that aldehydes 11a and 11b also bind in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in the (S)configuration (PDB: 6M0K and 6LZE) (Figs. S4A). 12 In protomer C, however, the same hydroxide group orients outwards from the oxyanion hole, forming hydrogen bonds with His41 (Fig. 5C), which gives the (R)-configuration. This (R)-configuration is consistent with the binding mode of \u03b1-ketoamide 13b in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB: 6Y2F) (Fig. S4B). 9 These two unique configurations R and S might be a result of the Cys145 thiol nucleophilic attacking the aldehyde from two different faces (Figs. 5B & D). The fact that GC-376 (64) can adapt two different configurations R and S upon binding to the active site might explain its high binding affinity towards the target. An additional difference between the configurations of GC-376 (64) in A, B and C is observed in the orientation of the phenylmethyl ester. In protomer C, the CH2 of the phenylmethyl points towards the main chain of Leu167 in a 'cis' conformation (Fig. 5C), whereas in protomers A and B this same CH2 points downwards in a 'trans' conformation (Figs. 5A & S3). Consequently, this influences the rotameric configuration of the Leu167 isobutyl moiety, where a rotational adjustment of 180\u02da occurs at its \"\u03b2\" carbon. Furthermore, large rearrangements are observed in the flexible TSEDMLN loop consisting of residues 45-51(TAEDMLN in SARS-CoV-2 M pro ) that form the S2 and S3' subsites (Fig. 5F), explaining the broad substrate scope in the P2 site (Table 3). The loop conformations in protomers B and C may be influenced by crystal packing interactions with protomers from adjacent asymmetric units and resemble the conformations in previously determined structures11,12 . Meanwhile, the conformation of protomer A is less restrained and exhibits the most significant conformational divergence. The different loop conformations offer a glimpse of the protein plasticity that allows M pro to accommodate peptides with differing amino acid composition, and underscores the importance of considering this flexibility when analyzing and modeling protein-ligand interactions for M pro .",

            "text": "28), an FDA-approved HCV drug, inhibits the enzymatic activity of M pro with IC50 of 4.13 \u00b5M, and has an EC50 of 1.90 \u00b5M against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cellular viral cytopathic effect assay. The therapeutic potential of boceprevir(28) should be further evaluated in relevant animal models and human clinic trials. Since boceprevir (28) is a FDA-approved drug, the dose, toxicity, formulation, and pharmacokinetic properties are already known, which will greatly speed up the design of followup studies; 2) GC-376 (64), an investigational veterinary drug, showed promising antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (EC50 = 3.37 \u00b5M ). It has the highest enzymatic inhibition against the M pro with an IC50 value of 0.03 \u00b5M. This compound has promising in vivo efficacy in treating cats infected with FIP, and has favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, GC-376 (64) is ready to be tested in relevant animal models of SARS-CoV-2 when available. Importantly, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with GC-376 (64) provides a molecular explanation of the high binding affinity of aldehyde-containing compounds as they can adapt two configurations R and S. The conformational flexibility at the TSEDMLN loop explains the broad substrate scope at the P2 position of M pro inhibitors; 3) Three calpain/cathepsin inhibitors, MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62), are potent inhibitors of M pro and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 with single-digit to submicromolar efficacy in the enzymatic assay. Calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62) also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the CPE assay with EC50 values of 2.07 and 0.49 \u00b5M, respectively. This result suggests that calpain/cathepsin inhibitors are rich sources of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, previous studies have shown that calpain and cathepsin are required for the proteolytic processing of the coronavirus S protein, a step that is essential for the viral fusion and genome release during the early stage of viral replication. 39 Calpain and cathepsin inhibitors such as MDL28170 (calpain inhibitor III) 39 , MG-132 40 , calpain inhibitor VI 41 have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. Other than the increased potency of targeting both M pro and calpain/cathepsin, an additional benefit of such dual inhibitors might be their high genetic barrier to drug resistance. A significant number of calpain/cathepsin inhibitors have been developed over the years for various diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration disease, kidney diseases, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. 42 Given our promising results of calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62) in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 M pro and their potent antiviral activity in cell culture, it might be worthwhile to repurposing them as antivirals for SARS-CoV-2.",

The absorbed dye was eluted from the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% S\u00f6rensen's citrate buffer (pH 4.2)-50% ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm. Readings were converted to the percentage of the results for the uninfected control using an Excel spreadsheet developed for this purpose. EC50 values were determined by plotting percent CPE versus log10 inhibitor concentration. Toxicity at each concentration was determined in uninfected wells in the same microplates by measuring dye uptake. SARS-CoV-2 VYR assay. Virus yield reduction (VYR) assays were conducted by first replicating the viruses in the presence of test compound. Supernatant was harvested 3 days postinfection from each concentration of test compound and the virus yield was determined by endpoint dilution method. Briefly, supernatant virus was serially diluted in log10 increments then plated onto quadruplicate wells of 96-well plates seeded with Vero 76 cells. The presence or absence of CPE for determining a viral endpoint was evaluated by microscopic examination of cells 6 days after infection.
