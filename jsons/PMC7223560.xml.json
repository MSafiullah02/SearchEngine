Both added nine cases to cases already published in the \u201cGerman textbooks on neurology\u201d (Fig. 1). Their paper offers detailed descriptions of 60 patients, of which 23 were fatal. The frequent involvement of bulbar muscles in their cases led them to name the phenomenon \u201casthenic bulbar paralysis.\u201d Ptosis was common and bothersome because the compensation of \u201cthrowing back the head\u201d was impaired by weakness of the neck muscles. The paper emphasized choking, fluid regurgitation through the nose, diminished palatal reflex, and a lowered tone of voice suggesting weakness of the vocal cord adductors. Additionally, patients were unable to thrust out the cheek and maintain protrusion of the tongue. When chest movements were measured circumferentially, the difference between inspiration and expiration did not exceed a quarter of an inch. Dyspnea with exertion was common as well as \u201cunaccountable attacks of breathlessness, during which the patient is in danger.\u201d Sputum accumulation in the mouth accompanied these dyspneic attacks with patients unable to swallow or to spit it out. \u201cThe tongue appears to sink back into the mouth.\u201d Pulling back the tongue markedly improved the symptoms. The fatal cases were a result of choking or \u201cdyspneic attacks\u201d or \u201cdyspneic attacks with pneumonia.\u201d (Autopsies found nothing anatomically wrong in the medulla oblongata.) The paper emphasized that \u201cinvolvement of respiratory muscles with consequent attacks of dyspnea is a symptom of gravest significance\u201d and warned that death may occur during one of these attacks.",

            "text": "Rowland was among the first to point out the dangers to patients of this overdose; he noted that large amounts do not improve weakness and may even provoke additional weakness in previously unaffected muscles. Too much acetylcholine induces a neuromuscular-depolarizing block (nicotine effect) with consequently more weakness. Muscarinic effects come first with sweating and \u201ceructation\u201d followed by abdominal cramps, increased peristalsis, vomiting, and dyspnea. Subsequently, nicotine-like effects occur with generalized weakness and fasciculations that appear initially in the eyelids and facial muscles before becoming more generalized. There is also anxiety, restlessness, giddiness, tremors, and emotional lability. The degree of weakness occurring in the two crises is often identical, but the excessive salivation, marked sweating, clammy and cold skin, muscular fasciculations would support the diagnosis. On the other hand, in a 1951 paper, Rider described a patient in myasthenic crisis showing dyspnea, weakness, and much mucous and saliva. This resulted in the patient choking on increased secretions and requiring 336 mg of IM neostigmine over 24 h [11].",

The ratio of myasthenic crises to cholinergic crises was three to one. Tracheostomy greatly facilitated management of excessive bronchial secretions, particularly in cholinergic crisis, and usually shortened the overall time spent on the respirator (Fig. 2). Of the 24 crises that terminated in death, 15 were myasthenic, 5 were cholinergic, and 4 were mixed in nature [1].Treatment of cholinergic crisis was atropine sulfate, often in large doses but starting with 1 mg. Atropine dose could exceed 8 mg but was stopped when the pupils started to dilate.",

The main reason was that the drug contributed to a full NMJ block and secretions as a result of the parasympathetic effects of Prostigmin. However, the remissions were of short duration and required the patients to start medication in reduced doses. Patients not responding to several doses of neostigmine methyl sulfate, 2 mg, given deep subcutaneously (or those showing obvious signs of neostigmine intoxication and not responding to reduction in dosage, with inability to maintain proper pulmonary ventilation) could be precipitously withdrawn from neostigmine and placed in the respirator after elective tracheotomy. The rationale for this therapy was fourfold: (1) neostigmine was demonstrated ineffective in maintaining vital respiratory function; (2) the drug contributed to further neuromuscular junction block; (3) the parasympatheticomimetic properties of neostigmine enhance pharyngeal and tracheobronchial secretions, which, in turn, promote the development of atelectasis and pneumonia; and (4) minimal response may produce respiratory movements and breathing out of phase with the respirator, which is counterproductive because it leads to further exhaustion. The main pathophysiologic mechanisms were clarified by Osserman\u2019s group [13] (Fig. 3).",
