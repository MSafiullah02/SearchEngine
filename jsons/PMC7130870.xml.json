From the results of most randomized clinical trials, the cause of CAP for patients admitted to a hospital is determined in approximately 20% to 40% of cases, and in observational studies has ranged from less than 10% for outpatients to approximately 20% for inpatients.1 At present, several issues contribute to the difficulty with establishing an etiologic diagnosis in pneumonia, including (1) problems with currently available diagnostic tests, (2) recent trend toward empirical therapy without an emphasis on establishing an etiologic diagnosis, and (3) delays because of outsourcing of laboratory tests.",

Most studies found that once empiric therapy was given, the results of diagnostic laboratory tests did not affect management2, 3, 4, 5, 6 because the spectrum of the empiric agents was so broad that regardless of whether or not the pathogen was identified, the clinical response was uniform and often was evident by the time the laboratory results were available to the physician. As a result, microbiological testing, including sputum cultures, Gram stains, and even blood cultures became de-emphasized. According to the most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2013American Thoracic Society guideline, microbiological tests are presently universally recommended for high-risk patients intensive care unit (ICU) admitted to the hospital.7 Although numerous reasons have been proposed for a decrease in microbiology testing, the most powerful influence by far has been the rise of empiricism.8 With widespread use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy, antimicrobial resistance has increased.8\n",

Notably, immunochromatography is not suitable for evaluation of therapeutic effect, because positive test results are obtained for several weeks to months after recovery. Moreover, the immunochromatographic assays are nonspecific for pneumococcal infections in children, particularly the very young, as nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae can cause false-positive results.12 In one study, the presence of azotemia was an independent factor associated with a higher rate of a positive test for patients with bacteremia.13 The investigators suggested this may have been because of increased concentration of urine for these patients, as most of the patients had reversible impaired renal function most likely caused by dehydration. Supporting the theory of the effect of concentrated urine, Gutierrez and colleagues11 reported increased test sensitivity after urine concentration by centrifugation, and a study conducted by the manufacturer found that the test\u2019s ability to detect pneumococcal antigen decreased with serial dilution.15 Thus, patients may be more likely to test positive after urine sample concentration or before intravenous fluid resuscitation. Of note, pneumococcal vaccine may cause false-positive results in urine in the Binax NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae test in the 48 hours following vaccination.15\n",

PCR techniques based on amplification of the pneumolysin or autolysin genes are applicable for the diagnosis of pneumonia, otitis media, and meningitis. Autolysin and pneumolysin PCR using sputum have shown a high sensitivity (more than 80%) but a low specificity (30%\u201340%).30, 31 Interpretation of sputum PCR is limited by the difficulty in differentiating between pneumococcal colonization and true infection. On the other hand, in pleural fluid, PCR detects the pneumolysin gene with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 93%.32 One approach that may help to resolve the problem of colonization versus infection is quantification of the target organism by real-time PCR. Yang and colleagues33 evaluated the utility of a real-time pneumolysin gene PCR test using sputum samples from patients admitted with CAP. Of 129 patients, 23% had S pneumoniae isolated from blood or sputum. The sensitivity and specificity using real-time quantitative PCR were 90% and 80%, respectively. Of note, PCR of blood samples from patients with S pneumoniae infection does not appear to be useful. One study compared the ICT S pneumoniae urine antigen test to PCR of blood in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal infections.34 The urinary antigen test was positive in 51 of 58 bacteremic pneumococcal cases (sensitivity, 88%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 77% to 95%), whereas PCR was positive in only 31 cases (sensitivity, 53.5%; 95% CI, 40% to 67%; P<.0001), and all of these had detectable urinary antigens. Both tests gave positive results in 2 of 51 control patients (referred to as other-organism septicemia), giving a specificity of 96% (95% CI, 86.5% to 99.5%). In 77 patients with nonbacteremic CAP, urinary antigen was detected significantly more often (in 21 patients [27%]) than a positive result by the PCR protocol (6 [8%]) (P<.002).34 A recent meta-analysis concluded that currently available PCR methods using blood samples for the diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal diseases lack the sensitivity and specificity necessary for clinical practice.35 To date there are no FDA-approved PCR tests for S pneumoniae.",

Despite this, PCR is increasingly being recognized as a method of choice for detection of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae. For both of these pathogens, diagnosis has usually relied on serology, which, as indicated previously, is usually not useful to the clinician during acute medical management. One large study examined the use of real-time PCR to detect M pneumoniae in children with CAP and found that PCR detected more cases than standard diagnostic techniques, which included culture.42 Of significance, PCR results were available within 2 hours\u2014a major improvement over the 2 to 6 weeks usually required for serologic diagnosis. For C pneumoniae, culture on cell lines has traditionally been considered as a gold standard for diagnosis. However, cell cultivation is technically complex, and is associated with limited viability and slow growth such that it is restricted to specialized laboratories and is, therefore, not often used. For these reasons, PCR has become an option for diagnosis. There are numerous assays described (again non-FDA approved) but with various results of test performances and significant interlaboratory discordance of detection rates.26, 36, 37\n",

However, even in specialized laboratories many viruses cannot be readily cultivated. Thus, many cases of viral illness go undetected and the exact incidence of viruses in CAP has remained uncertain. PCR offers the potential to significantly improve viral detection. For many respiratory viruses, PCR is now the most sensitive diagnostic approach. Most clinical microbiology laboratories use reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect RNA viruses from clinical specimens.22 This technique is very sensitive and can detect transcript from a single cell. The method uses a reverse transcriptase enzyme to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA from an RNA template. The resulting complementary DNA is then used as the template in a PCR assay.",

In a prospective study during a 12-month period (2004\u20132005) of adult patients admitted for CAP, etiology was assessed using molecular methods (PCR for viruses, Legionella, Mycoplasma, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and S pneumoniae; urinary antigen assay for S pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1) in addition to conventional studies (blood, respiratory culture, serology) for 184 patients.49 A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of all the patients. However, in 38 patients for whom all diagnostic methods were applied, a pathogen was identified for 89% of cases. The most frequently detected pathogens were S pneumoniae and respiratory viruses (Table 2\n). Another study using NAATs for the identification of respiratory viruses in adult patients with CAP evaluated 183 adult patients with CAP, 450 control subjects, and 201 patients with nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infection.47 At least one respiratory virus was identified in 58 patients with CAP (31.7%) compared with 32 (7.1%) in control subjects and 104 (51.7%) in patients with nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infections (P<.01 and P<.01, respectively) (Table 3\n).

Guchev and colleagues51 prospectively assigned patients with mild pneumonia to 2 groups. Those with positive urinary antigen test results were treated using pneumococcal-directed therapy with amoxicillin. Those with negative urinary antigen test results were treated with clarithromycin, based on perceived likelihood of infection by atypical pathogens. Of 219 evaluable patients, 22% had a positive urinary antigen test result. There was no difference in the clinical outcomes of the 2 groups. Notably, 47 (62%) of 71 patients in whom an atypical pathogen was identified were in the urinary antigen\u2013negative arm, whereas 24 (38%) were in the urinary antigen\u2013positive arm, indicating that they had S pneumoniae in association with an atypical pathogen. However, since the atypical pathogens were determined by serologic methods, these latter cases might have represented a primary atypical infection followed by secondary infection by S pneumoniae. In such cases, it is probable that the clinical manifestations of infection that were treated were attributable to S pneumoniae, and this may explain the good response to amoxicillin alone. The investigators concluded that the urinary antigen test allowed them to administer targeted therapy with a penicillin-class antibiotic rather than a broader-spectrum agent, and added that such narrow-spectrum therapy can be more cost effective and can allow broad-spectrum agents, such as macrolides or fluoroquinolones, to be reserved for patients whose urinary antigen test result is negative. Potential cost reductions are likely to be influenced by price differences between the targeted and broad-spectrum agents and by the proportion of positive test results. Also, it should be noted that at the time of this study in Russia, there was little beta-lactam or macrolide resistance of S pneumoniae. In addition, the study was performed in military trainees who were young (mean age, 19 years) and generally healthy. The investigators suggested that additional trials are needed for other clinical settings.",

According to the investigators, targeted therapy was associated with a nonsignificant, slightly higher overall cost (primarily because of the cost of the antigen test), reduction in adverse events, and lower exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The investigators observed no significant clinical differences in outcomes (such as mortality, clinical relapse, or length of stay in the hospital). In fact, they observed more relapses in the targeted arm. The problem with this study, however, is that the investigators did not \u201ctarget\u201d therapy until 2 to 6 days after initial intravenous broad-spectrum therapy was initiated. Thus, this study really did not assess the potential for point-of-care decision. Indeed, the investigators acknowledge in their discussion that if there had been earlier introduction of targeted therapy, there may have been an economic benefit, and they indicate that targeted therapy has the potential to lead to less resistance.",

            "text": "Rapid identification of viral and bacterial pathogens is now possible with the use of PCR methods. An open randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical impact of PCR use for detection of etiologic pathogens in patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections.54 Between November 2002 and March 2004, 107 patients were included (55 had CAP, 22 had exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 30 had \u201cother respiratory infections\u201d). Patients were randomized to an intervention group, whereby results of PCR analyses (respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens) were reported (\u226448 hours), or a control group, which relied on conventional diagnostic tests (although PCR was run but not reported). Real-time PCR increased the diagnostic yield from 21% to 43% of patients compared with conventional tests and this was primarily because of an increase in the detection of respiratory viruses. This led to cessation of antibiotic treatment for 6 (11%) patients, but overall antibiotic use was comparable in the intervention groups and the control groups. Use of PCR was associated with an increase in cost (because of the cost of the PCR test). Clinical outcomes (mortality, length of therapy) were not significantly different. As pointed out in an accompanying editorial, the lack of a change in antibiotic use was not unexpected, given the study design.55 Most additional diagnoses in the intervention group were of viral pathogens. Many clinicians would not be brave enough to stop antibacterial agents solely on the basis of discovery of a viral pathogen, especially given the possibility of bacterial co-pathogens in adults. Furthermore, the results were not available at the point of initial antimicrobial decision when directed therapy might be most effective. As the investigators indicate, \u201cto mimic real-life situations, decisions regarding treatment changes after results of PCR analysis were left at the discretion of the physician.\u201d Thus, there was no standardized approach using this information by the clinician. One wonders if there had been an educational process to provide strategies for directed therapy there might have been a different result. Certainly with the present influence of antimicrobial stewardship programs, the knowledge of earlier diagnosis might be better suited for directed point-of-care therapy. As stated by the investigators in the discussion, \u201creal-time PCR might have been more cost-effective if clinicians would have been less reluctant to change clinical management on the basis of test results. Studies with protocol-based and more-rigorous patient management are needed to address this issue.\u201d Such a protocol is now under way, funded by the National Institutes of Health.56\n",

If a practitioner has the capability of obtaining the results of a valid test in a timely manner at the point of care, the result can be useful for assessment of patients presenting with manifestations of acute respiratory infection, including pneumonia. PCT-guided initiation and termination of antibiotic therapy is a novel approach to reduce antibiotic overuse and guide duration of therapy. This is essential to decrease the risk of side effects and emerging bacterial multidrug resistance. Interpretation of PCT levels must always account for the clinical setting and knowledge about assay characteristics. When PCT is used to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in patients with CAP, the functional assay sensitivity and cutoff ranges need to be considered. The most sensitive assay, and the one with which most of the data are derived, is the Kryptor assay, from which results can be obtained within 1 hour.",

As with any guideline and to ensure patient safety, specific \u201coverruling\u201d criteria have been established such that the PCT-based recommendation should be bypassed based on associated factors and clinical judgment (see Table 4).",

Immunochromatographic-based urinary antigen tests are rapid, simple-to-perform assays that can be easily developed as point-of-care patient tests. Further development is dependent on defining new antigens that can be readily detected. Molecular diagnostic techniques are becoming increasingly popular in clinical microbiology laboratories. Many of these combine sensitivity, specify, and rapid turnaround time to allow timely patient care. With the development of these methods, the clinical microbiology laboratory is no longer reliant solely on the conventional culture methods for detection of pathogens. Molecular methods have created new opportunities for the clinical microbiology laboratory to affect patient care in the areas of initial diagnosis and therapy. Over time, the methods have become more automated and the potential for clinical utility increased. In addition to providing excellent new tools for diagnosis, molecular tests will also serve useful roles in infection control and public health.55\n",

Moreover, there will be the question of 24/7 availability. Will smaller community hospitals be able to rationalize the added cost of equipment and personnel to run these tests in a timely manner? In addition, the issue of laboratory reimbursement needs to be addressed, as the current reimbursement by CPT code does not adequately cover the cost of many molecular tests (of course if the test results can result in downstream lower total cost of care by shortening illness and length of stay, these costs can be justified).",
