Droplet inhalation into the respiratory tract and contact transmission through infected secretions are thought to be the chief routes of person to person transmission [2]. The potential for airborne transmission is still being studied [3, 4, 5, 6], and if proven, will have a major impact on measures to reduce transmission as well as the need and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) [7, 8, 9, 10]. Patient respiratory activity and medical procedures such as intubation, bronchoscopy or respiratory tract suctioning are thought to generate aerosols that may remain airborne for some time and place healthcare workers at risk of infection. Otolaryngologists and anaesthetists in particular, perform these high risk aerosol generating procedures (AGP) which expose them to potential droplet, contact and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13], whether the patient is in a symptomatic or asymptomatic phase of the disease process.",

During this pandemic, some paediatric services have been taken over by adult patients and staff have needed to be deployed to areas they have had minimal training in. Infected healthcare workers can affect departmental rostering such that AGP may need to be undertaken by clinicians who are less accustomed to the procedure in normal circumstances. Emergencies requiring AGP may need attendance after hours and working with unfamiliar staff with variable skillsets and knowledge of the risks.",

Approaching AGP during this crisis requires a shift in mindset of the whole team involved, moving away from productivity and turnover to, instead, emphasising safety and risk mitigation. This requires actively taking time to pause and contemplate instances when respiratory secretions could be aerosolised and the area where they might linger, the surfaces that may be contaminated by droplets, and how to minimise these routes of transmission to healthcare workers. Surgeons and anaesthetists need to be proactive in balancing safe patient management with protection not only of themselves, but their trainees, nursing and operating theatre staff.",

Three AGP were undertaken prior to the formulation of the operative team checklist. Simulation was performed with a mannequin in the operating theatre using the example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for retrieval of an airway foreign body. Amendments to the checklist were made after performing 14 various high risk Otolaryngology AGP on paediatric and adult patients with unknown COVID-19 status (presumed positive). One of these cases was the emergency removal of a pistachio nut from a distal left main bronchus on a 16-month old child weighing 10.7kg that had been inhaled 6 days prior to presentation (Figure 1\n). The child was COVID negative but managed as status unknown with full high risk AGP precautions to allow real life simulation and identification of areas for improvement.",

To avoid close direct visualisation and suction through a rigid bronchoscope, the use of a glass window plug, flexible suction catheter and endoscopy forceps through the working channel can help if other endoscopic equipment is not available or suitable but may have its limitations. There will however, be circumstances where having an open airway is unavoidable such as retrieval of a laryngeal foreign body. Suction in this situation should be minimised as much as possible. With all airway manipulation, nursing staff and/or surgical assistants need to occlude suction tubing and only release it when signalled. Similarly, the anaesthetic team should communicate with each other when to stop gas flows during periods when the rigid bronchoscope or other airway devices are being inserted or withdrawn.",

The LMA does not provide a complete seal but may be a better alternative to an open airway in situations where avoiding intubation is preferable. Flexible bronchoscopy can be useful for a diagnostic assessment, however, it is generally a less familiar approach, ventilation can be obstructed by the presence of the scope in an endotracheal tube, the scope may be too big for a small child, the working channel is smaller and longer limiting therapeutic instrumentation available, it may be harder to manipulate and maintain coverage under the plastic drapes and the image quality may be inferior to the rigid telescope. Final smooth withdrawal of an airway foreign body using flexible forceps may be hampered by the size of the material and the holding strength of the forceps. Flexible endoscopy forceps that are small enough to fit through working channels are usually designed for taking biopsies and may break an organic foreign body into smaller pieces necessitating multiple passes for complete retrieval.",

A designated team member (e.g. anaesthetic nurse) is delegated to supervise plastic drape removal by several staff members together, to ensure the contaminated surface is rolled onto itself and away from staff in a caudal direction before discarding. Accessories under plastic drapes such as the perspex box or side arm must be carefully detached, as they will potentially be soiled by surface droplets. Patient eye tapes need to be removed slowly. Depending on the procedure, the surgical team should distance themselves from the patient but may need to stay in the operating room with all equipment still connected to assist in the event of laryngospasm or unexpected deterioration.",
