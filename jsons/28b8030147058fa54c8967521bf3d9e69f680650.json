We developed rapid and sensitive one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays (rRT-PCR) for simultaneous detection of influenza viruses currently circulating in humans, and the avian A/H5 virus. The detection limit of each assay was 4.8 to 1 copies per reaction and no cross-reactivity with other major respiratory pathogens was found. Analytical positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) sensitivity and specificity were 100%, 94.1%, 93.7% and 100%, respectively. Clinical evaluation revealed that 1,976 (16.5%) of 11,963 throat swabs from patients with respiratory symptoms were confirmed as 1,651 (83.6%) A/H1pdm09, 308 (15.6%) A/H3 and 17 (0.8%) B virus during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Collectively, the multiplex rRT-PCR assays described here provide a practical tool for reliable implementation of influenza surveillance and diagnosis.",

In Korea, the first confirmed case was identified on May 2 nd -a person who had travelled to Mexico following the outbreak there. Since then, the pandemic virus spread rapidly until early 2010 and by January 2010 there were 16,447 cases that had been confirmed by laboratories in public health institutes. At the beginning of the pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 ((H1N1)pdm09) virus outbreak, there was no specific molecular detection system until the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended protocol (CDC rRT-PCR swine Flu panel) became available (WHO, 30 April 2009) . In-house conventional RT-PCR based on A/California/04/2009 virus genome sequences was the only applicable method in the Korea National Influenza Center (NIC). However, additional sequence analysis was needed for confirmation at that time. In May 2009, the Korea NIC introduced the CDC real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) swine Flu panel with minor modifications and used it for clinical diagnosis until the end of the pandemic. Thereafter several multiplex rRT-PCR for large scale influenza surveillance and diagnosis have been developed by other groups (Chidlow et al., 2010; Huber et al., 2011) .",

However, these methods are laborious, time-consuming and hard to standardize among the laboratories in local public health institutes which participate in surveillance. As the pandemic (H1N1)pdm09 virus emerged in April 2009, Korea NIC introduced rRT-PCR which was the WHO-recommended US CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel (WHO, 30 April 2009) to detect (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Although it showed invaluable performance during the early phase of the outbreak, it had some drawbacks (relatively low sensitivity to swH1 compared to the InfA assay, crossreactivity with A/H5 of swInfA and single assay format) that made it undesirable to introduce for routine surveillance and diagnosis, in terms of cost-effectiveness and user convenience (Shu et al., 2011) .

Each assay was performed over a wide dynamic range and showed no cross-reactivity with other circulating respiratory viruses or bacteria. The assay also incorporates an internal control Glycrealdehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe to screen possible PCR inhibitor or viral RNA extraction error. We also utilized the WHO EQAP panel for the evaluation of the A/H5 assay because there has so far been no H5N1 human infection case in Korea. The WHO panel consists of RNAs of seasonal influenza and avian influenza A/H5 with relatively low copy number, and inactivated seasonal influenza viruses (Table 3) . For the Korea NIC, it is crucial to detect HPAI A/H5N1 human infection, because it has prevailed continuously in poultry farms since 2003 (Lee et al., 2005 (Lee et al., , 2008 .",

The detection limit of multiplex rRT-PCR described in this report is lower than 10 copies per reaction (Fig. 1) , which suggests that these are comparable to other published assays (Chidlow et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011) . Moreover, we evaluated the assays by introducing them to nationwide influenza surveillance. Thereby, the assays could be validated in different work environments (17 public health institutes which participated in surveillance) with very large numbers of clinical specimens, and have shown excellent performance with reduced working time and costs compared to previous single type or two-step rRT-PCR assays (He, 2009; Nakauchi et al., 2011; WHO, 30 April 2009 ). However, the assays missed 10 influenza A (7 H3 and 3 H1pdm09) culture positive samples, because these showed signals which were near the detection limit (Ct values of >35 in A/M and subtypes) even after viral culture (Table 4 ). One of our major concerns is laboratory contamination by PCR amplicons which cause false positive results, since conventional RT-PCR had previously been applied for influenza detection until the introduction of rRT-PCR to surveillance. Thus, viral RNA extraction, reaction mixture preparation and sample loading were carried out in a separated room to prevent possible contamination. We also tried to adjust assay sensitivity between the typing (multiplex set for influenza A or B type) and the subtyping assays to avoid inconclusive results in the influenza A sample that require further sequencing or tissue culture analysis.",
