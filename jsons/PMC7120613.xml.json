            "text": "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly acute and fatal disease of domestic and wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) caused by a positive-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Caliciviridae family (Capucci et al., 1990, Ohlinger et al., 1990). The disease is characterised by a short course (2\u20133 days), high levels of morbidity (100%) and mortality (80\u201390%), few but severe signs (dyspnoea, anorexia, depression, convulsions and epistaxis) and by a severe necrotising hepatitis (Marcato et al., 1991). RHD is endemic in many countries in Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Although the disease and its etiological agent have been investigated for the past decade, several aspects of pathogenesis are still to be clarified. These include: the site where virus replication occurs initially; how the virus reaches the hepatocytes; and the role of Kuppfer cells in viral distribution in the liver. Clarification of these aspects could provide a better understanding of the mechanisms which lead to the viral degradation associated with a chronic form of the disease (Barbieri et al., 1997) and why young animals below the age of 45 days are susceptible to RHDV infection but do not develop any sign of the disease.",

In the picornaviridae it has been estimated that negative strand RNA amounts, on average, to less than 3% of total viral RNA in cells where the virus is actively replicating (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1991). Unfortunately these data cannot be confirmed for RHDV by in vitro studies because no suitable cell culture system has been identified so far (Xu and Chen, 1989).",

The results confirmed the data of a previous study (Gelmetti et al., 1992) suggesting that the liver is the most important site for RHDV replication. Viral replication appeared to begin almost immediately after inoculation, as indicated by the presence of scattered positive hepatocytes as early as 8 h p.i. Thereafter, with the exception of one animal (16 h p.i.), all liver samples were positive with the antisense probe and the signal gradually increased. The negative result at 16 h was best explained by individual differences in susceptibility to infection, as previously observed (Gelmetti et al., 1992).",

In particular, in a recent study on early stages of RHDV infection using PCR, it was reported that both the liver and the spleen contained viral RNA from 18 h p.i. (Guittr\u00e9 et al., 1996). However all these methods differ from ISH in terms of preparation of the sample since they involve organ homogenisation and therefore the contamination by virions present in the blood stream or associated with blood cells cannot be excluded. Passive transfer of virions from liver to spleen, and not RHDV replication in the latter, was previously suggested (Barbieri et al., 1997). The results obtained above further support this hypothesis. It may well be that mature virus particles pool in the spleen but do not replicate in spleen cells.",
