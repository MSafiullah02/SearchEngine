In dengue\u2019s infection, CRP has been suggested to be used as a prognostic marker, and higher levels of CRP indicating increased risk of disease progression [6, 7]. It\u2019s noticeable that dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 are RNA virus, sharing similarity in the course of infection. CRP is rapidly synthesized by hepatocytes when stimulated by inflammation. It binds to a variety number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens, facilitating complement activation through classical pathway [8], indicating immune activation, lymphocyte infiltration, immune molecules consumption and inflammation outbreak. Clinically, increased CRP levels might be early indicators of nosocomial infections in COVID-19 patients who were slow to recover, and might aid physicians to administer empirical antibiotics treatment early to prevent worsened outcome [9, 10].",

However, there was no difference of neutrophil count in the two subgroups (Fig. 4b), indicating the innate immunity played less role in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Furthermore, the patients of CRP 2 group experienced significantly longer inpatient duration than that of CRP 1 group, which are reasonably explained by the more severe illness for patients in CRP 2 group.",
