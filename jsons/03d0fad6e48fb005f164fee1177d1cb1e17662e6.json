Some of the more commonly encountered drug interactions to be considered in patients taking antibiotics for the treatment of LRTIs information is frequently unhelpful in predicting the aetiology. Even when microbiology results are available, the delay in obtaining results and the limitations of the available diagnostic tests in identifying the aetiological agent make empirical treatment necessary (see Table 2 ). Differentiation of pneumonia caused by 'typical' and 'atypical' pathogens on clinical grounds alone has been shown to be unreliable. The latest BTS guidelines 3 suggest that microbiology tests are of low sensitivity, particularly in patients with nonsevere CAP and no co-morbid disease. Although Legionella and pneumococcal antigen testing kits are now available and have considerably greater sensitivity than blood or sputum cultures, their routine use in patients at low risk is felt not to be cost effective. The extent of microbiological investigations in patients with nonsevere CAP should be guided by clinical and epidemiological factors and by the response to previous antibiotic therapy. 3 Point-of-care tests are available for influenza (A and B). Specificity is generally excellent but sensitivity may be as low as 50-74 per cent. These rapid tests allow a diagnosis of influenza to be made within 10-30 minutes, such that timely prescription of antivirals can be made and/or the clinician may feel more confident about not prescribing antibiotics. 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major cause of CAP, accounting for over a third of cases in the community. 3 More unusual forms of pneumonia to consider are Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously known as Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia in patients with HIV and other forms of immunosuppression -seen much less frequently these days because of the use of prophylactic co-trimoxazole, TB in those with a more chronic pneumonia, and rare fungal and bacterial forms of pneumonia in those who have travelled.",

Bacterial pneumonias in this age group are predominantly due to Strep. pneumoniae, whereas in the over-fours Strep. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are the most frequently isolated organisms. 8 Resistance Concerns exist over the growing number of resistant bacteria, in particular Strep. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA).

Prudent use of antibiotics is important in order to treat infections appropriately to curb the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance and to minimise side-effects and maximise compliance. Once a decision is made to treat, local resistance patterns must be taken into account. BTS recommendations are based on current practice and experience and take into account the cost, tolerability, safety and side-effect profile of the drugs currently available. As yet, the incidence of highly penicillin-resistant strains of Strep. pneumoniae in most areas of the UK is sufficiently low to allow amoxicillin to remain the first-line therapy for adults and for children under five years of age -provided that the patient has not just returned from an area where the incidence is much greater. Note, however, that the latest BTS guidelines recommend adequate dosing with amoxicillin (500mg-1g three times daily) to cover intermediate-resistant strains. 3, 10 Macrolides such as erythromycin are the secondline agents of choice if there are contraindications to amoxicillin or the patient fails to tolerate it. They are also the first-line agents in children over five years in whom M. pneumoniae is common. 11 Many people favour clarithromycin over erythromycin because of its better GI tolerance.

If they have failed to improve they should be considered for addition of an agent to cover atypical organisms if not already on one, and for radiography and/or hospital admission. 10 Over the last few years several new drugs with greatly improved bioavailability and tolerability have become available for use in the treatment of CAP. The fluoroquinolones, eg moxifloxacin (Avelox) and levofloxacin (Tavanic), which have antistreptococcal activity, have both an excellent antimicrobial spectrum -they are active against atypical pathogens and Legionella species as well as the common 'typical' organisms -and advantageous pharmacodynamic characteristics. With the increasing prevalence of penicillin-and macrolide-resistant pneumococci they may well have a place in therapy. However, due to concerns over the rapid development of fluoroquinolone resistance in pneumococci and other organisms, these newer fluoroquinolones should be considered only when first-line agents have been ineffective and when the causative agent, if identified, is known to be sensitive. 3 There are additional concerns in that fluoroquinolones appear to be a significant risk factor in precipitating C. difficile infections caused by the hypervirulent 027 strain. 12 Although these data were largely based on ciprofloxacin use, it is likely that the newer fluoroquinolones will have a similar effect.

Since most H. influenzae are resistant to erythromycin and other macrolides, these are not recommended for treatment of exacerbations unless Chlamydophila or Mycoplasma are suspected. Patients who experience frequent exacerbations are more likely to have resistant organisms and may require broad-spectrum antibiotics.
