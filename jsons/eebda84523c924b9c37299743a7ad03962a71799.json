Already, the basics of array technology are being adapted to characterize more than gene expression, to include the diagnosis of disease predisposition in humans, the rapid identification of specific viruses in infected humans, and protein analysis through the burgeoning field of proteomics. In this review, we consider the history of microarray development, fundamentals of the technology involved, and applications for the medical and pharmaceutical industries.

Their seminal publication was titled \"Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray\" and has since been cited over 1,500 times [2] . The authors described the use of a robotics system to spot DNA oligonucleotides onto glass slides in ordered arrays, generating microarray slides or \"gene chips.\" Labeled cDNAs made from varied samples of Arabidopsis thaliana (mustard plant) mRNA were hybridized to DNA on the chips. Only 45 oligonucleotide sequences were spotted in this first experiment, representing a tiny fraction of the total number of the genes present in Arabidopsis, but the work inspired many new experiments and soon whole genomes of species such as yeast, bacteria, mice, and humans were being spotted onto glass slides. Some early studies asked questions about genome size and diversity in different yeast strains or changes in gene expression as yeast experienced varied growth conditions. As was to be expected from such a revolutionary new technology, there were many surprises. Lashkari et al. [3] showed that laboratory yeast strains sometimes discard DNA fragments, encoding whole sets of genes. Researchers realized that culturing cells in common rich broths selects for the fastest growing cells, offering an advantage for cells that have discarded genes that are unnecessary for rapid growth. DeRisi et al. [4] showed the concerted induction and repression of numerous genes and pathways as yeast responded to environmental changes such as the depletion of glucose. By looking for upstream regulatory elements and transcription \u00b6 To whom correspondence should be addressed: Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, CA 90263.

This would include everything from building an array printer, to generating oligonucleotide probes for all 6,400 yeast genes, to printing and utilizing the arrays. DeRisi and Brown developed and posted a \"how to\" manual for building an array printer from scratch, known as the Mguide [5] , and laboratories throughout the world began to build.

Developmental biologists have measured changes in gene expression in organisms at different developmental stages. Neuroscientists have studied patterns of gene expression in varied areas of the brain before and after specific tasks are performed,and compared transcriptional patterns in pathological (e.g. Alzheimer's) versus nonpathological brains. Molecular biologists have looked at changes in gene expression when specific mutations or gene knockouts were present in an organism. Tissuespecific gene expression patterns in normal kidney and heart have been compared with those found in abnormal pathological conditions such as kidney failure and heart dysfunction. From the study of micropathogenesis to evolution, microarray expression analysis has identified gene candidates and signaling pathways for investigation. Thus, microarray analysis provides interesting leads in almost all fields of biology, offers a genome-wide glimpse into genetic \"terra incognita,\" and challenges scientists to explore this unknown world.",

Golub et al. did a proof-ofprinciple study designed to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia from acute lymphoblastic leukemia using patterns of gene expression in patients' bone marrow samples [6] . The study showed that tumor gene profiling correctly identified the cancer type in 36 out of 38 patients, with the remaining two identified as \"uncertain.\" These scientists suggest that a battery of tumor \"class predictor\" genes can be used for diagnostic confirmation or clarification of unusual cases. This point was dramatically illustrated by using the tumor predictors in an actual case in which a boy had classic symptoms of acute leukemia, but his tumor cells had atypical morphology for this disease. Microarray analysis of the boy's tumor cells suggested that he did not have leukemia because there was low expression of leukemia class predictor genes. Instead, the genes expressed suggested muscle cancer. The boy was eventually diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma and his treatment changed accordingly [6] . Because these two types of cancer have quite different treatment modalities, microarray analysis may have saved this boy's life.",

The subgrouping of tumors according to expression patterns has led to optimal treatment modalities with associated lifespan extension. An example of using microarray analyses for the hierarchical clustering of cancer cell types is shown in Fig. 1 . The 60 tumor cell lines used by the NCI to screen anti-cancer compounds were classified solely by gene expression patterns. The results reveal a correlation between expression pattern and the cell type from which the tumors originated [8] .

Northern analysis identifies quantitative differences of expression between samples, but only for the gene selected. This method is cumbersome when large numbers of genes are being examined and would be impossible to use on a genome-wide scale. Microarray technology is based on a similar process of hybridizing complementary probe and target strands of nucleic acids. Gene chips are produced containing 30,000 or more spots on a slide (\u03f3100 m spacing), each spot containing DNA oligonucleotides or cDNA clones specific for a known gene. These gene chips are probed with fluorescently labeled mRNA or cDNA, and comparisons of gene induction and repression are made using alternate-colored labels for distinct RNA samples [2] . The hybridizations performed on a single gene chip are equivalent to performing tens of thousands of comparative Northern blots in 1 day (Fig. 2) . Microarrays can simultaneously compare the expression of all known genes in each paired sample, offering a powerful tool for the analysis of gene expression patterning.",

After printing, the DNA is covalently cross-linked to the glass slide. Arrays manufactured by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) use photolithography and solid-phase chemistry to synthesize small oligomers on the surface of a glass slide. For each of the genes being examined, a complementary oligonucleotides is synthesized. In addition, corresponding sets of oligomers are synthesized with known mismatches for the gene sequence. These sets of oligomers offer a measure of binding specificity during hybridization. Unlike some of the array methodologies listed below, Affymetrix arrays compare control and experimental gene expression profiles using two separate arrays, which are scanned separately.

Fluorescently labeled probes can be prepared by several different methods including direct or indirect cDNA labeling, cDNA labeling with fluorescent dendrimers, direct mRNA labeling, and direct or indirect labeling of amplified RNA [5, 10, [13] [14] [15] . RNA amplification may be the method of choice when isolating RNA from limiting samples, such as those from tissue biopsies. For use in microarray protocols requiring cDNA synthesis, Su-perScript II reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) is recommended because it generates high cDNA yields. An alternative enzyme is Im-Prom-II reverse transcriptase from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). Promega offers a training support program for educators using molecular biology techniques, and many of their products are offered to educators at a discount (contact Diana Long; Fax: 608-277-2601).",

Although this procedure is relatively straightforward, fluorescently modified nucleotides are bulky and incorporate less efficiently than unmodified nucleotides. In the indirect cDNA labeling method, aminoallyl-modified nucleotides are incorporated during the reverse transcription reaction, and fluorescent dyes are subsequently coupled to the reactive amino groups in the cDNA. Because the amine-modified nucleotides resemble unmodified nucleotides more than the fluorescently labeled nucleotides used for direct labeling, the reverse transcription reaction is more efficient. One disadvantage of the indirect labeling method is that the procedure takes more time to perform. A newer method uses fluorescent dendrimer complexes to label cDNA [13, 14] . After cDNA synthesis, a fluorescent dendrimer with hundreds of dye molecules per complex is hybridized to the cDNA. Genisphere offers discount pricing and other promotions of 3DNA (dendrimer) sample kits with Cy3/Cy5 or Alexa 546/647 dyes to GCAT members, and protocols using 3DNA products are on the GCAT website (www. bio.davidson.edu/projects/GCAT/GCATprotocols.html).",

Chips are often prehybridized with a solution containing bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding of labeled probe to the surface. Hybridization and wash solutions must be evenly distributed over the chip to maximize interactions between probe and target sequences and minimize background fluorescence. During hybridization the chips are stored in a humidified, temperaturecontrolled, darkened environment. Small, affordable, aluminum chambers that house one or two chips work well, and can simply be placed in a standard incubator or water bath during the hybridization steps.

The background fluorescence is calculated locally for each spot and is subtracted from the hybridization intensities. Differentially expressed genes are identified by comparing the fluorescence intensity of control and experimental probes hybridized to each spot [11-13, 16, 17] . Typically, the experimental target sequences are labeled with Cy5, which fluoresces red light (667 nm), and control targets are labeled with Cy3, which fluoresces green light (568 nm). The ratio of red to green signal can then be used as a measure of the effect of the experimental treatment on the expression of each gene. A ratio of 1 (yellow spot) indicates no change in the expression level between experimental and control samples, while a ratio greater than 1 (red spot) indicates increased transcription in the experimental sample, and a ratio less than 1 (green spot) indicates decreased transcription in the experimental sample. A scatter plot is a very useful representation of the expression data; the signal intensities of the experimental and control samples are plotted along the x-and y-axes, and the ratio values are plotted as a distance from the diagonal [13] . The diagonal separates spots with higher activity than the control sample from spots with lower activity than the control. The scatter plot provides a visualization of the fluorescence ratios obtained from the experimental and control samples. One can then easily choose points that represent a severalfold increase or decrease in gene expression and focus additional analyses on these genes.",

First, microarray projects represent an excellent example of the use of molecular biology and strengthen students' conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills associated with the molecular biology laboratory. Second, proper experimental designs demand advanced thinking and planning if one is to generate reliable and reproducible data. Microarray experiments teach students to critically assess their experiments for reliability, reproducibility, and the inclusion of proper controls. Third, data analysis allows students to experience first-hand the data-rich environment of the genomics era through the use of data sets that are freely available in the public domain. Students analyze data sets that might include the entire yeast (or another organism's) genome and use microarray analysis software to cluster groups of genes displaying similar patterns of induction/ repression. This intensive introduction to genomics cannot be replaced by any amount of lecturing or demonstration. GCAT faculty are committed to providing their undergraduate students opportunities to engage in modern genom-ics in a meaningful way, and although the inclusion of microarrays in the curriculum can be challenging to students and faculty alike, consortium members enthusiastically believe the program is working.",

Their focus is upon Arabidopsis thaliana, which offers a short life cycle, the relatively simple generation of transgenic plants, and a sequenced genome [21] . Information gained from their studies is applied to crop plants through collaborative efforts with Monsanto (St. Louis, MO). The scientists at Ceres generate full-length cDNA libraries, characterizing each gene sequence represented in the library through nucleotide sequencing, database searches, protein product analysis, and expression analysis using microarray analysis. They generate transgenic plants that express each of these cDNAs at high levels and analyze these plants through a comprehensive phenotypic screening program. The whole process is designed to enable a very large number of genes to be evaluated simultaneously. This type of multifaceted characterization of genes generates a database of integrated information about each gene [22] . Researchers then utilize this information to design gene modifications that may offer improved crop performance in areas that include stress-resistance (drought, heat, cold), resistance to insects/viruses, or even plant structure (seed/leaf size, fruit characteristics).",

Researchers can select genes displaying the desired pattern of expression and use the A. thaliana genome information to extract the DNA sequence of the promoter sequence for that gene [24, 25] .

Similar applications of microarrays are being used in the pharmaceutical industry to determine the influence of a particular drug on cellular function, using the microarray as a critical component in assessing drug toxicity or secondary effect upon cellular function [27] . More traditional analyses focus upon cell survival, or specific physiological characteristics, but these are limited in their ability to detect subtle influences of a drug.

            "text": "There are a growing number of applications for chip technology beyond gene expression analysis. One highly anticipated application has been the rapid determination of genotype using oligonucleotides arrays. Individuals in any population display differences in phenotype (traits), and currently it is very difficult to identify the specific genetic makeup (or genotype) that determines any given phenotype. Ultimately scientists need to follow the segregation of each gene as it passed from one generation to the next, and establish a correlation between traits and the alleles of every gene. Traditional strategies for genotype determination have been laborious and limited, scanning hundreds or a few thousand genetics markers to crudely examine the genotype of each individual at relatively low resolution. The markers being used in these newer genotyping strategies are at the level of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which occur at high frequency in the genome, about every 1,000 base pairs [28] . If all SNPs for each individual in a pedigree could be determined, researchers could follow genetic information at high resolution as it is passed from generation to generation. But determining over a million SNPs for each sample is a daunting task. To offer high-throughput determination of SNPs, oligonucleotide microarrays have been developed for the rapid and accurate analysis of genotype [29 -32] . Perlegen Sciences (Mountain View, CA) and Affymetrix have collaborated to develop microarrays for the detection of SNPs in humans. Introduced in 2001, the first generation of these tests (GeneChip\u00ae HuSNP) examines 1,500 SNPs for each DNA sample. Using a manufacturing process that has been adapted from the semiconductor industry, Perlegen Sciences is now developing a protocol that will utilize tens of millions of probes on a glass wafer to characterize \u03f31.5 million SNPs for each individual sample (www.perlegen.com). Rapid SNP-based genotyping will offer applications in preventive medicine, diagnosis of disease, characterization of complex traits, forensic science, and even the development of effective pharmaceutical treatment of disease [33] [34] [35] . CONCLUSIONS It is clear that the development of array-based technologies represents a fundamental shift in the way scientists study living organisms. More that just a new experimental technique, microarrays employ the massive data generated by genome sequencing and use that data to comparatively examine genome-wide expression patterns. The data sets produced offer a high-resolution map of the genes being regulated to mediate cellular differentiation, adaptation, division, and evolution. This technology is a first glimpse into how researchers will utilize genome data in coming years. Educators are beginning to teach genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics in undergraduate biology and computer science courses and a few, such as those in the GCAT group, are beginning to include these technologies in the teaching laboratory. Far from being just a lesson in new technology, these courses are introducing the new age of biology to the next generation of scientists. It is an exciting, data-rich age in which the entire landscape of experimental possibility has changed. Every graduate pursuing a career in the life sciences will be impacted by these changes, and it is critical that educators begin to develop curriculum accordingly. Biology is indeed being transformed by genomic research, and undergraduate faculty and students need to join the party.",

Adapted from Ref.16, reprinted by permission of Pearson Education.FIG. 2. An overview of microarray analysis. 1, mRNA is purified from experimental and control samples, and fluorescent label is incorporated either during or after cDNA synthesis or through direct labeling of the mRNA to generate probe. Labeled probes from experimental and control are then pooled. 2, The pool of labeled probes are hybridized to a microarray slide containing thousands of spotted oligonucleotides or cDNAs. 3, Slides are scanned for fluorescence emissions at selected wavelengths, and a high-resolution image file is generated. 4, Using microarray analysis software, the image file is annotated to identify each spot, and then fluorescence intensities are quantified and analyzed as described in the text. The A. thaliana photographs were contributed by Steve Davis (Pepperdine University, Malibu, CA). The microarray image was contributed by GCAT faculty member Laura Hoopes and undergraduate research student Allen Kuo (Pomona College, Claremont, CA). The data analysis images are from MAGIC, software generated by GCAT faculty member Laurie Heyer with a team of undergraduate students (Davidson College, Davidson, NC).",
