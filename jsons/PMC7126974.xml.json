Apart from the well-established enzymatic sensors, the selectivity of affinity interactions such as those of antigen\u2013antibody or nucleic acid hybridisation is exploited for the respective development of promising immuno and nucleic acid assays (Campas and Katakis, 2004). Nucleic acid detection is becoming relevant not only in the field of food analysis but also in clinical diagnosis. A DNA/RNA test addresses the question of whether a patient is infected with a particular pathogen or not. It is advantageous compared to immunoassay in cases of recent infection or underlying immunodeficiency. Moreover, it is very useful for treatment monitoring, since elimination of pathogen nucleic acids indicates successful handling.",

            "text": "Miniaturisation, on the other hand, is one of the more recent trends in Analytical Chemistry. Although it is important in all fields, it is of special relevance in the area of biosensors. The simplicity of the electrochemical instrumentation and the type of measurement that is made adapt well to miniaturisation requirements (Matisyk, 2003). Several alternative ways of electrochemically detecting DNA are possible (Wang, 2002). The intrinsic electroactivity of adenine and guanine can be the basis for direct measurement of nucleic acids (Wu et al., 2003, De-Los-Santos-Alvarez et al., 2002). The determination of electroactive indicators that intercalate or otherwise associate with double-stranded DNA (Gherghi et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2003) is another alternative. The use of enzymes is a possibility that enhances assay sensitivity enormously due to their inherent amplification. Horseradish-peroxidase has been used as an enzyme label (Alfonta et al., 2001, Pividori et al., 2001) as well as glucose oxidase (Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2004) and alkaline phosphatase (Carpini et al., 2004, Aguilar and Ritsch, 2003). Although enzymes can be directly conjugated, the use of a well-known affinity interaction such as avidin\u2013biotin is an easy alternative. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) converts orthophosphoric monoesters into alcohols and thus various phosphate esters can act as substrates. Phenylphosphate (Jenkins et al., 1988), p-aminophenylphosphate (Meusel et al., 1995) and p-nitrophenylphosphate (Tie et al., 1992) are among the most common. \u03b1-naphthylphosphate (NP), which is hydrolysed to naphthol, has been widely used (Abad-Villar et al., 2002a, Carpini et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2001). 3-Indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) has been proposed by our research group as an adequate substrate for AP in immunoelectrochemical approaches (Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez and Costa-Garc\u00eda, 1998). Due to its satisfactory electrochemical behaviour, it has been used for the development of AP-based enzyme immunoassays (Bengoechea-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2002), this being the first time for it to be used to perform DNA assays on gold surfaces.",

The use of carbon and gold electrodes as electrochemical transducers for DNA hybridisation sensors has recently been summarised (Lucarelli et al., 2004). Gold has always been an appropriate material for the electrochemical detection of substances, while also allowing different formats. Thin-film gold electrodes produced by magnetron sputtering have been voltammetrically and amperometrically characterized (Brett et al., 1997). The quartz crystal balance for piezoelectric measurements and surface plasmon resonance, likewise based on thin gold electrodes, have been respectively used for DNA analysis (Minunni et al., 2003, Jordan et al., 1997). Gold also offers the relevant possibility of generating self-assembled DNA monolayers through thiol groups (Levicky et al., 1998, Zhang et al., 2002) due to the strong binding between sulphur and gold, which may be considered almost covalent (Bain et al., 1989).",

Reducing the cell volume has several advantages (Wijayawardhana et al., 1999), the first being the decrease in the diffusion distances required for analytes to reach their surface-bound receptor partners. Moreover, in the case of enzymatic detection, the product dilution, which is a critical factor in achieving low detection limits, diminishes.

Bearing in mind that streptavidin adsorbs easily onto gold surfaces, ST-AP (10 \u03bcL of 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22128\n M solution) was immobilised on the gold film for 10 min by physical adsorption. After cleaning (with 0.1 M Tris\u2013HCl buffer, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2), 20 \u03bcL of 6 mM 3-IP were added. This concentration has already been employed in previous studies (D\u00edaz-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002, Casta\u00f1o-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2004). After 15 min, 3 \u03bcL of concentrated H2SO4, and 7 \u03bcL of Milli-Q water were added. The acid was needed not only to stop the reaction, but also to sulphonate and solubilise the indigo blue that was formed. Water was added to increase the volume until 30 \u03bcL, considered the optimum total volume for an adequate operation. The acid:water volume proportion may be changed when great quantities of indigo blue are produced, always maintaining the final volume (10 \u03bcL). No signal was obtained when the procedure was followed without immobilising AP on the working electrode. The only significant difference between signals recorded for IC solutions or enzymatically generated IC is that, in the latter case, the peak potential moved slightly to more negative potentials. This is possibly due to the in situ generation of the electroactive substance, which favoured the electrochemical process. The potential scan was consequently performed between \u22120.15 and +0.3 V. As the signal obtained for 10 min (29 \u03bcA) is not much lower than that obtained for 15 min (32 \u03bcA), 10 min was the one subsequently employed. The relative standard deviation of measurements carried out in different surfaces (n\n = 4) of a gold film was 5.3%.",

Using a drop volume of 5 \u03bcL and a strand concentration of 1.02 \u03bcM, different immobilisation times were employed at room temperature (22 \u00b0C approximately), 37 and 47 \u00b0C. It can be observed that the enhancement of the signal with immobilisation time was greater when evaporation occurred, which corresponds to 30, 15 and 10 min for room temperature, 37 and 47 \u00b0C, respectively. When immobilisation took place at 4 \u00b0C overnight (12 h, also attaining evaporation), the signal was similar to that obtained at 37 \u00b0C (27 \u03bcA versus 29 \u03bcA, respectively). Therefore, both methodologies could be employed. The repeatability of the signals obtained for both immobilisation procedures was also similar, obtaining an R.S.D. of 9 and 8% for five measurements when immobilisation was carried out at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min and 4 \u00b0C for 12 h, respectively. Considering five different gold films, precision was analogous, with an R.S.D. of 10%.",

Ethanolic solutions of thioctic acid, 6-mercapto-1-hexanol and 1-hexanethiol were tested. The first one possesses a disulphide bond, whereas the other two are hydrocarbonated chains with a thiol function, one of them with a hydroxy group at the other end. Although there is a preference adsorption for thiols, disulphides give rise to similar species (Bain et al., 1989). The length of the chain was chosen so as to allow hybridisation and electrochemical processes to take place, since too dense monolayers do not allow electronic transference (Kelley et al., 1999). Shorter chains are more volatile and hence more difficult to handle. Thioctic acid and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol produced high background and the S/B ratio was not favourable (1.56 and 1.4, respectively). Although for 1-hexanethiol the background was similar to that obtained for other compounds, the signal was much higher, resulting in a more adequate ratio (4.9). 6-Mercapto-1-hexanol is normally employed for DNA assays; however, the authors have not found any reference to the use of 1-hexanethiol in this type of application despite its favourable behaviour.",

This might be caused by steric hindrance, due to the large size of albumin, which may hinder hybridisation. It has been reported that the creation of mixed monolayers of thiol-modified DNA probe and a spacer thiol (mercaptohexanol) in two steps makes DNA molecules stand up consistently in such a way that they become accessible for hybridisation (Herne and Tarlov, 1997).

It was successfully applied to the development of genosensors, in particular for the detection of a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus specific sequence. Immobilisation of a DNA probe on the gold surface was carried out through a thiol group attached to the 3\u2032-end with an aliphatic spacer. The parameters affecting immobilisation were studied employing a double-labelled (biotinylated and thiolated) DNA strand. AP-labelled streptavidin was used for enzymatic detection. Blocking with 1-hexanethiol produced well-defined signals. Evaporation of solutions was a critical point for achieving optimum results, favouring immobilisation while preventing hybridisation. The enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-IP allowed low detection limits (6 pM) to be achieved with respect to analogous schemes reported in the literature. Selectivity of the assay was demonstrated using a 3-base mismatch DNA strand. Clear discrimination was possible employing 1 h of hybridisation time and 50% of formamide in the buffer. Work is in progress to study selectivity in more depth, with the aim of also obtaining discrimination for 2-base and 1-base mismatch strands.",
