Until a vaccine becomes available, there will be an ongoing need for prevention of infection through public health, clinical testing, behavioral, and pharmacological means. This is particularly true for health care workers who risk daily exposure to COVID-19 positive patients and community contacts. Unfortunately, personal protection equipment (PPE) has been shown insufficient in and of itself, with 2-6% of healthcare workers routinely exposed to COVID-19 patients becoming infected themselves [1, 2] The quickest route to a therapy is to repurpose existing approved medications if they show some activity against COVID-19 to either block infection, or prevent viral replication as a means to lower the severity of disease of those who do become infected. In this regard, the repurposing of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for chemoprophylaxis has garnered the most attention. Early studies report hydroxychloroquine may actually substantially worsen outcomes in COVID-19+ patients, so it is difficult to recommend them as prophylactic therapy or treatment at this time [3] . National double blind, placebo controlled, well powered studies are currently underway to evaluate true efficacy of these medications. However, even if ultimately proven effective, there remains concern over the potential for significant cardiovascular and ocular toxic side effects with widespread use of these agents, and the NIH currently recommends against use of hydroxychloroquine therapy as a prophylactic [4, 5] .",

            "text": "There are additional approved medications that have been proposed to have efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or lowering disease severity or duration in patients infected with COVID-19. In particular, doxycycline is a rational candidate drug to be evaluated for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Doxycycline is a generally safe tetracycline derivative that has been available for decades, most commonly dosed acutely at 100mg BID to treat bacterial infections. Lower dose, 20mg BID has been proven effective for longer term treatment (i.e. months or years) of acne rosacea and periodontal disease [6] . At the lower dose the primary observed side effects are short term nausea when first initiating treatment in a few subjects and sun sensitivity [7] . Our recent trial at the University of Virginia, involving 300 subjects (average age 80 years old) evaluating low dose doxycycline use over 2 years to prevent progression of macular degeneration, revealed no safety issues with the medication (TOGA study https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01782989 ) . Beyond routine use as an anti-biotic, doxycycline (and more generally tetracycline derivatives) may have a role as effective anti-viral agents and as an anti-inflammatory drug that can ameliorate the inflammatory response following viral infection [8, 9, 10, 11] . Early studies indicate potential efficacy of minocycline against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [12] , and doxycycline against Dengue and Chikungunya infection [9, 10] . In addition, doxycycline is known or proposed to target several pathways that regulate viral replication [13, 14, 15] .",

            "text": "Potential mechanisms of action for doxycycline against COVID-19 include: 1) inhibition of metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular MMP-9 which has been demonstrated important for viral replication [13, 16] ; 2) inhibition of Nf-kb, which is known to inhibit both the cytokine inflammatory response such as IL-6 (aka cytokine storm), and also viral load in general [17, 18] ; 3) proposed inhibition of papain-like proteinase (PLpro) responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyprotein which releases non-structural proteins 1, 2 & 3 (Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3) essential for viral replication [19] ; 4) proposed inhibition of 3C-like main protease (3CLpro) or Nsp5 which is cleaved from the polyproteins, causing further cleavage of Nsp4-16, mediating maturation of Nsps essential in the virus lifecycle 30]; 5) inhibition of proper processing of replicase proteins and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. Doxycycline, like hydroxychloroquine, is an ionophore which binds divalent cations (including Zinc) to facilitate cell membrane transport, and thereby increase Zinc concentration in the cell. Elevated Zinc has a known inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV, and potentially many other viral types which is why it is frequently used for the common cold (some of which are caused by human coronavirus) [15] ; 6) apoptosis of senescent epithelial cells, which have known increased expression of DPP4/CD26 which serves as an entry point for COVID-19 into the cell, and which likely exhibit increased viral replication in these cells [20] ; 7) prevention of viral entry into the cell via inhibition of Nf-kb, which in turn binds to the DPP4 promoter thereby diminishing DPP4 cell surface expression required for viral entry [21] . Note that DPP4 demonstrates increased expression in older subjects and subjects with diabetes or pulmonary disease, and may account in part for their increased morbidity and mortality to COVID-19 as compared to younger/healthier demographics [20] ; 8) inhibits (specifically low-dose doxycycline) expression of CD147/EMMPRIN which studies suggest is needed for SARS-CoV-2 entry into T lymphocytes [22, 23] .",

This dosing regimen will eliminate chelation of Zinc by Doxycycline in the GI tract allowing time for absorption of both for those subjects on both. 3876 total COVID-19 negative subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Doxycycline treatment (1938 subjects) and to placebo (1938 subjects). Subjects will remain on treatment or placebo for a total of 50 days to determine the safety and efficacy of lowdose, sub-microbial doxycycline to 1) reduce the infection rate of COVID-19 in previously uninfected subjects and 2) reduce the clinical severity of COVID-19 disease for those subjects that become infected during the course of the study. 3876 subjects are sufficient to power the study to have an 80% chance of detecting a statistically significant 2-fold difference in rate of infection of subjects on doxycycline versus placebo, assuming a 2.5% rate of infection in placebo subjects and 1.25% rate of infection of those taking doxycycline during the 50 day study.",

Given the urgent medical need, safety profile of doxycycline, as well as to provide better insight into recruitment and operational logistics for the study, we have elected to run a parallel initial open label arm in which subjects will be placed on 20mg low dose doxycycline. This open label study is anticipated to continue for approximately the first 4-6 weeks of enrollment, enrolling up to 1938 subjects, before the double blind, placebo controlled component is initiated upon completion of study drug/placebo manufacture and packaging. This arm will serve as a sentinel for any potential safety or efficacy signals in the study population and establish whether and to what degree the study has been appropriately powered. Similarly, many healthcare providers have self-initiated elemental Zinc, which may potentially, but not necessarily, affect study drug efficacy given that doxycycline serves as an ionophore. The open label arm may also provide further insight regarding any potential challenges or benefits to the concomitant use of Zinc supplements in addition to doxycycline, versus those not. To standardize treatment for this variable we will recommend those taking Zinc formulations use 50mg Zinc gluconate [24] . If they are not on that form of Zinc and prefer to stay on Zinc through the study, we will offer to supply the Zinc to reduce variability around the Zinc in the study. Results of this openlabel doxycycline study will necessarily be analyzed separate from those of the double blinded, placebo controlled study.",

Doxycycline is a generally safe tetracycline derivative that has been available for decades, most commonly dosed at 100mg BID to treat bacterial infections. However, in addition to its anti-microbial properties, doxycycline (and more generally tetracycline derivatives) may have a role as an effective anti-viral agent and as an anti-inflammatory drug. Early studies indicate potential efficacy of minocycline against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [12] , and doxycycline against Dengue and Chikungunya infection [9, 10] . In addition, doxycycline is known or proposed to target several pathways that regulate viral replication. [13, 14, 15] Doxycycline is a particularly attractive candidate as a COVID-19 prophylactic given it has been used in clinical practice for decades and maintains an excellent safety profile as demonstrated in multiple clinical studies. Any effective prophylaxis for COVID-19 should be able to demonstrate high efficacy at preventing infection and/or lowering severity of disease. Equally important, it should demonstrate this efficacy at dosing levels that are highly unlikely to precipitate any untoward severe side effects.",

The study requires twice-daily administration which is consistent with the prescribing recommendations for sub-antimicrobial doxycycline for treatment of acne rosacea and periodontal disease.

Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint will be the proportion of non COVID-19 infected subjects in each study-arm who go on to become infected with COVID-19 over the course of the 50 day intervention. Primary hypothesis: The primary null hypothesis will be that the risk for COVID-19 infection among subjects who have high risk exposure to COVID-19 positive patients and who are treated with Doxycycline Hyclate 20mg BID is the same as the risk for COVID-19 infection among subjects who have high risk exposure to COVID-19 positive patients and who are treated with placebo-control: Primary analysis: In accordance with the stratified randomization scheme of the study (section 5.2.1), the software of the FREQ procedure of SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC) will be use to conduct a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel chi-square analysis that will test the null hypothesis that the \"common\" risk of COVID-19 infection is the same for Doxycycline Hyclate 20mg BID treated subjects and for placebo-control treated subjects (i.e. \"common\" relative risk ratio = 1), versus the alternative hypothesis that the \"common\" risk of COVID-19 infection is not the same for Doxycycline Hyclate 20mg BID treated subjects and placebo-control treated subjects (i.e. \"common\" relative ratio risk \u2260 1). A p\u22640.05 decision rule will be used as the null hypothesis rejection criterion for this chi-square test and a 95% confidence interval for the true \"common\" relative risk ratio will be obtained as part of the FREQ procedure analytical output. Test of homogeneity of the risk ratio: The \"Epi\" package of R [7] will be used to conduct a chi-square test to test homogeneity of the relative risk ratio across the different stratification variables (see section 5.2.1).
