The journal assumes a cross-sector and multidisciplinary approach, inviting scholarship from clinical, biological, social, political, economic, environmental and information sciences. It caters to a wide audience including: academics, policy-makers, health care practitioners, and public health professionals. After a decade of publishing, the journal has become a trusted source of high quality peer reviewed papers.",

Over 4 million papers have been downloaded, resulting in more than 2300 individual citations. We continue to attract authors from across the world and from diverse backgrounds, including academics, policy makers, humanitarian and development aid workers, Ministers of Health, students and a Nobel Prize winner. Globalization and Health is rapidly climbing the ranks of public health related journals in the world, and our impact factor rising from 1.485 in 2012 to 2.25 in 2014. We are particularly proud of the international reach of our papers and of our free-to-publish provision for authors from low-income countries.",

To mark our tenth year as a journal, and the migration of the journal to its new institutional address at the Centre for Global Health, Trinity College Dublin, members of the current editorial board undertook a review of all the articles that have been published to date. The purpose of this review was to identify strengths, trends and current gaps in research; highlight opportunities for strengthening existing research; and to propose upcoming areas of research, projected to be of increasing importance over the next ten years.",

In the first stage, an open coding process was applied, whereby all abstracts were read and 43 overall themes identified. In the second stage, these 43 themes were reassigned to 20 thematic categories with the help of a second researcher (Table 2, Column A). Subthemes were then identified through rereading of abstracts, and the paper in full in cases where it was felt that subthemes were not obvious from the abstract (Table 2, Column B). Finally, axial coding was used to identify similarities or overlaps in thematic categories and across papers in the context of existing frameworks in global health research [1, 2] (see Table 3). As an interim step, descriptive characteristics were drawn from each paper, including the number and country of origin of authors (Table 1), type of journal article (Fig. 1), regions of focus of the paper, and disciplinary focus. These are presented below.",

Eight articles (2.4 %) examined or contrasted between low-income and high-income countries.

Sustained use and access to antiretroviral therapy was another frequently occurring topic under this construct. The changing discourse surrounding HIV and AIDS from an incurable disease to a chronic illness was also investigated and the policies, both global and at national level, were explored to see if they were reflective of this change [38].

We believe that the interplay between local contexts and global factors influencing health is a particularly valuable and distinctive contribution of Globalization and Health. Much of the research explored the national and community contexts in which diseases occurred, with papers focusing upon how strategic plans can be developed at national level to tackle the burden of NCDs [41].
