Information technology (IT) investments in the financial sector are among the highest due to the enormous profit potentials within the industry as well as the economic incentives for substituting expensive human labor by cheaper computers [8]. Furthermore, digital strategies are part of banks\u2019 core strategic decision making and hiring the right people to work within a more digital environment is of central importance [9]. Consequently, the financial sector has also been one of the first sectors to experience challenges with acquiring people possessing the right digital competences as well as managing the digital competences of the existing workforce. A Capgemini survey from 2017 shows that 62% of the banks see the digital talent gap widening, which is the highest rate among all other industries analyzed (e.g. automotive, retail, consumer products, telecom) [10]. However, considering the specificities of the technological applications in the banking industry, the question remains what type of digital competences are needed and required in this field. Scholars in the information systems discipline have been researching the required digital competences for specific occupational groups for a long time. For instance, recent studies have already addressed digital competences of communicators or data professionals [5, 11]. Other studies emphasize the general need for further research on this topic [4].",

More detailed, we consider junior financial analyst which we define as financial analysts with less than three years of job experience (including graduates). This selection is based on two assumptions formulated in the work of Rynes et al. [12]. First, applicants for entry-level or junior positions have less concrete \u201cproof\u201d of their ability to work on the job. It can thus be assumed that the digital competence requirements are stated more clearly and precisely in job descriptions (which build the basis for our analysis, see Sect. 3) while experienced hires have to show their competencies through work samples. Second, graduate hires are a long-term investment for companies, as their productivity levels are significantly lower in the beginning than more experienced hires. It can therefore be assumed that companies not only require the competences for these entry-level positions that are relevant for their current responsibilities, but they also look at the suitability of candidates for further career steps. Looking at entry level position thus also gives insights into medium- and long-term competence requirements.",

Instead of a definable construct, it can be understood as a boundary concept applicable to various contexts but always related to skills and practices required to use new technologies in a meaningful way [13]. The idea of understanding and being able to operate technologies is however concomitant with their invention and use in the workplace and society. For example, Calvani et al. [14] suggest a definition of digital competence involving the flexibility to explore new technologies and the ability to select and evaluate data critically to solve problems and gain knowledge. Ferrari [15] applies the KSA framework of competence to define digital competences as a set of required knowledge, skills and attitudes to use information and communication technology (ICT) and digital media to perform tasks such as information management and communication. Furthermore, most definitions include content creating and sharing, building knowledge effectively and being critical as well as reflective when using IT for work, leisure and communication [16, 17].",

Accordingly, next to working with data and creating digital content, it is important that financial analysts can communicate and collaborate with others to create and distribute their analysis. Although being the third most frequent category it remains surprising that this category plays a relatively small role in the digital competence requirements. One potential explanation could be that the job of analysts is very individualistic and thus more based on individual performance and competences rather than the ability to work with others.
