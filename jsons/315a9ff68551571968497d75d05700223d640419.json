Resources and a defined workflow for care of anyone presenting with illness should be in place and will vary with institution and practice. Appropriate follow-up and repeat screening (commonly including testing) will determine suitability for rescheduling or return to work. 3. Potential exposure to infected individuals should be reported to the proper authorities (e.g., the Department of Health) to trigger contact tracing. 4. Room preparation and cleaning, as well as equipment reprocessing, should be performed in accordance with up-to-date requirements by licensing and society recommendations (see below). 5. All patients should be surveyed 1-2 weeks post-procedure to assess their satisfaction, to record potential adverse events and to assess for interval COVID-19 symptoms or positive test results. Contact tracing should be initiated if the interval between the encounter and new symptom onset is sufficiently short, or if, at any point, a staff member similarly tests positive. 6. Physical distancing rules (see below) need to be adhered to by patients and staff, except during intervals of close contact required by providers to prepare the patient for a procedure or conduct a physical exam. 7. When putting on or taking off PPE, proper hand hygiene needs to be practiced. 3, 4 8. Staff should remove watches, rings, earrings, necklaces, and other forms of jewelry before entering the endoscopy unit. Facial cosmetic products should not be worn if PPE is being reprocessed, such as with N95 masks. 9. All staff and providers should be oriented and trained on the unit's COVID-19 protocol including proper hand hygiene, the required PPE in their designated work area, proper PPE don and doff technique, location within the unit of replacement PPE, and proper disposal. A \"dry run\" of the implemented protocol is suggested. New staff and providers who may rotate through the unit, such as anesthesia providers, must be properly oriented and trained prior to working in the unit for the first time. Training and orientation should be repeated as protocols change over time.",
