The mother had 2 subsequent negative urines. The maternal treatment history was not clear, but she was treated at least once during pregnancy. Infant urine was submitted for C. trachomatis NAAT (Aptima Combo 2 assay; Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) on day 40 of illness and was positive (serovar unknown). The child had received no prior antibiotics; azithromycin was then administered for 5 days, resulting in prompt marked improvement in her respiratory symptoms. Repeat urine on day 75 after illness onset was negative using the same assay in the same laboratory. The nasopharyngeal specimen submitted at the initial ED visit (day 10 of illness) for respiratory viruses was negative when retrospectively tested by an in-house NAAT assay for C. trachomatis at the National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, Canada (Madico et al., 2000) (this assay was selected because the Aptima Combo 2 assay is not licensed for testing of a nasopharyngeal sample). However, a second nasopharyngeal specimen submitted for detection of pertussis in Regan-Lowe transport media 5 days prior to the positive urine (day 35 of illness) was positive for C. trachomatis serovar D using the same in-house NAAT assay (Madico et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1993) at the same laboratory. Two months after the azithromycin, the child had residual wheezing attributed to reactive airways disease.",

Given that most infected children are asymptomatic (Schacter et al., 1986) , even detection from 2 sites in the current report (the nasopharynx and urine) does not prove that the pulmonary disease was due to C. trachomatis. However, the fact that both urine (collected day 40 of illness) and the nasopharyngeal specimen (collected day 35 of illness) tested positive for C. trachomatis and that the child clinically responded to azithromycin makes it likely that C. trachomatis was contributing to the respiratory symptoms, at least during the latter ",

The sensitivity of genital cultures for C. trachomatis is thought to be below 80% (Cheng et al., 2001) ; sensitivity may be even lower for nasopharyngeal specimens as it is difficult to verify if an adequate sample was obtained. For genital C. trachomatis, it is now recognized that NAAT on a genital or urine sample has improved sensitivity over genital cultures while maintaining almost 100% specificity (Black et al., 2009) . A recent study showed increased yield with NAAT versus culture in neonates with conjunctivitis (Rafiei et al., 2012) . Therefore, NAAT on nasopharyngeal specimens would probably be superior to culture for detection of C. trachomatis pneumonia. There are reports of diagnosis of chlamydial pneumonia based on a positive NAAT on a nasopharyngeal sample (Chiang et al., 2005) , but current commercial NAAT assays are not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in nasopharyngeal or conjunctiva samples (Hammerschlag, 2011) . Data on the sensitivity or specificity of NAAT on nasopharyngeal samples are limited to a case series where infants had conjunctivitis rather than pneumonia. Five of 75 infants with C. trachomatis conjunctivitis had a positive NAAT on a nasopharyngeal sample with only 3 of the 5 being culture positive (Hammerschlag et al., 1997) .",

It is possible that urine NAAT could detect some cases as one would presume that many infants with pneumonia would also have urethral infection. Subclinical genital infection was detected by culture in 14% of vaginal or rectal swabs from infants born to infected, untreated mothers in a previous study (Schacter et al., 1986) . It seems likely that this rate would be higher with NAAT. A positive urine NAAT does not prove that pulmonary symptoms are due to C. trachomatis but is suggestive with a compatible clinical picture.",
