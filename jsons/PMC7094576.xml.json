The nursing workforce in Mainland China also faces similar challenges in recruitment and retention as a consequence of China entering the World Trade Organization, which has opened their labour market. Job mobility has also been fuelled by more relaxed immigration policies which has meant an increase in the number of Chinese nurses being recruited to western countries where salaries and opportunities are better (Ho, 1995). Recruitment and retention of nurses are persistent problems associated with job satisfaction. There is an urgent need for rigorous research regarding job satisfaction and related factors to inform the development of good nurse employment strategies in Mainland China.",

In this study, some characteristics of the respondents including age, length of working time and educational level may be a proxy of their higher professional competence.

The knowledge enrichment of the university-educated nurses may yield a broader perspective and a higher expectation of their working roles compared to that of diploma and associate degree nurses (Wetzel et al., 1989). However, the bachelor degree nurses\u2019 role perception is not dominant in a nursing workforce as they only represent a minority with about 5% of registered nurses in 2002 having a bachelor degree in China (Jiang et al., 2004). This study found even in the teaching hospitals in Beijing, as the highest health care institutes, less than 10% of nurses had a bachelor degree. Additionally, in hospitals, the bachelor degree staff nurses assume the same roles and tasks as those with a diploma or associate degree (Yang and Cheng, 2004), which may increase the bachelor degree nurses\u2019 role conflict arising from the different role expectations and task requirements from universities, hospitals, peers and themselves.",

One might expect to observe dissatisfaction with changes in education with the influence of American curricula and higher education and limited changes to the nurse's role in the guideline established by the Ministry of Health, China, but it is likely that those experiencing greatest dissonance between the expectations and reality of their role will have entered the global labour market and such individuals would not have been recruited to this study.
