BAG3 protein is the only member of this family containing also the N-terminally located WW domain. We describe here the identification of adenovirus (Ad) penton base protein as the first BAG3 partner recognising BAG3 WW domain. Ad penton base is the viral capsid constituent responsible for virus internalisation. It contains in the N-terminal part two conserved PPxY motifs, known ligands of WW domains. In cells producing Ad penton base protein, cytoplasmic endogenous BAG3 interacts with it and co-migrates to the nucleus. Preincubation of BAG3 with Ad base protein results in only slight modulation of BAG3 co-chaperone activity, suggesting that this interaction is not related to the classical BAG3 co-chaperone function. However, depletion of BAG3 impairs the cell entry of the virus and viral progeny production in Adinfected cells, suggesting that the interaction between virus penton base protein and cellular co-chaperone BAG3 positively influences virus life cycle. These results thus demonstrate a novel host-pathogen interaction, which contributes to the successful infectious life cycle of adenoviruses. In addition, these data enrich our knowledge about the multifunctionality of the BAG3 co-chaperone.",

In particular, the BAG family (six members in human genome) is characterised by the presence at the carboxylterminus of an approximately 80 amino acid BAG domain that has the ability to bind to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 and Hsc70 [Takayama et al., 1997; Antoku et al., 2001] . This interaction allows BAG family proteins to modulate the chaperone activity of Hsp70 [Lee et al., 1999; Takayama et al., 1999] . The BAG domain forms a three-helix bundle, which upon binding induces a conformational switch in the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and of bacterial Hsp70 analogue DnaK; this change in conformation being incompatible with the nucleotide binding results in the ATP-dependent release of substrate from the chaperone [Gassler et al., 2001] . The aminoterminal regions of BAG proteins are not homologous, which enables them to direct Hsp70/Hsc70 proteins to various targets and cellular locations.",

No partners of BAG3 interacting through its WW domain have been identified as yet, but BAG3 has been observed to bind through its PXXP motif the SH3 domain of phospholipase C-g (PLC-g), forming an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-regulated ternary complex with Hsp70/Hsc70 and PLCg [Doong et al., 2000] . These data suggest that BAG3 may be a multifunctional signalling protein linking Hsp70/Hsc70 with other pathways necessary for activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase signalling, which play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. It has been reported recently that the molecular chaperone HspB8 forms a stable complex with BAG3 through two conserved in BAG3 Ile-Pro-Val (IPV) motifs and that this complex is involved in protein quality control [Fuchs et al., 2010] .",

            "text": "Increases in cellular level of BAG3 protein have been noted in rat astrocytes after brain injury or upon ischaemia [Lee et al., 2002] . BAG3 induction was also observed upon heat and metal exposure in HeLa cells, with accumulation kinetics similar to that of Hsp70 [Pagliuca et al., 2003] . BAG3 (named earlier Bis) was discovered as an interacting partner of Bcl-2, and shown to suppress apoptosis [Lee et al., 1999; Antoku et al., 2001] . In this regard, BAG3 overexpression can decrease Bax-or Fas-induced apoptosis in human epithelial cells [Lee et al., 1999] . In contrast, an antisensemediated decrease in BAG3 enhances the apoptotic response to oxidative stress and to chemotherapy in neoplastic leukocytes and reduces tumour growth in mouse models [Ammirante et al., 2010] . Expression of BAG3 widespread in mice and humans, is highest in muscle tissues [Lee et al., 1999] , and is quite pronounced in developing rat brainstem and spinal cord [Choi et al., 2009] . BAG3 is an essential protein, since BAG3-deficient mice show stunted growth and fulminant myopathy and die within 4 weeks of birth [Homma et al., 2006] . It has been shown recently, that when mutated in one of IPV motifs (see above and Fig. 1B) , BAG3 is implicated in dominant childhood muscular dystrophy [Selcen et al., 2009] . Some data show that BAG3 may facilitate the disposal of aggregationprone proteins [Carra et al., 2008; Fuchs et al., 2010] and is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis during aging [Gamerdinger et al., 2009] . These observations together highlight the pro-survival activity of BAG3.",

The screen yielded several different penton base partners, among them BAG3 protein. The common structural feature of identified penton base partners is the WW domain, one of several domains known to promote physical interaction between proteins [Sudol, 1996] . Indeed, BAG3 is the only member of the BAG family that contains a WW domain, which is located in the N-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 1B) . WW domains of 25-40 amino acids contain a high proportion of hydrophobic aromatic and basic residues, two highly conserved tryptophanes at both ends and one invariable proline. These domains bind to short poly-proline motifs that differ from other poly-prolines such as ligands of the SH3 domains. Several classes of such poly-proline ligands of WW domains are known [for review, see Macias et al., 2002] and one of them, PPxY (prolineproline-amino acid-tyrosine) appears twice in the N-terminus of all sequenced penton bases.

            "text": "The membrane overlay technique was initially used to confirm the interaction uncovered by the library screen. The lysate of BAG3transfected HeLa cells contained two major bands revealed with anti-tag antibody (Fig. 1C, left panel) . The larger protein recognised by antibody against BAG3 tag migrated with an apparent molecular weight of $80 kDa rather than 64 kDa expected for BAG3; anomalous BAG3 mobility have already been noted by Lee et al. [1999] . The C-terminal BAG3 deletion mutant (BAG3DC, apparent MW of 50 kDa), synthesised in larger amount than full-length protein, ran at the level of 60 kDa. Both BAG3 proteins were able to attach subviral Ad3 dodecahedral penton bases particles recognised by anti-Dd antibody (Fig. 1C, right panel) . The band observed above the 36 kDa MW marker in Figure 1C , is probably a proteolysis product containing the BAG3 N-terminal WW domain since it is able to interact with base protein (Fig. 1C, right panel) . The bands visible above BAG3 are recognised by anti-Dd antibody in the nontransfected cells (Fig. 1C , lane c) and they might represent other cellular proteins interacting with the penton base. The thin band running at the level of complete BAG3 in lanes DC and of control possibly represents the endogenous BAG3 protein. The control blot treated with anti-Dd antibody alone did not show any bands (not shown). BAG3-or penton base-transfected cells were then immunoprecipitated with anti-c-myc tag antibody recognising overexpressed BAG3. The first membrane, developed with anti-BAG3-HRP antibody, showed correct immunoprecipitation of BAG3 (Fig. 1D , lanes BAG and BAG \u00fe Base). Revelation of the second membrane with anti-base antibody demonstrated that the Ad2 base protein was immunoprecipitated together with BAG3 protein (Fig. 1D , lane BAG \u00fe Base). In the absence of BAG3, penton base protein alone was not immunoprecipitated. Finally, to determine if this interaction exists under more physiological conditions, lysates obtained from cells infected with Ad2 for 40 h were immunoprecipitated with the antibody recognising endogenous BAG3. The antibody brought down penton base protein (Fig. 1E) , which shows that penton base expressed during Ad2 infection is indeed in the complex with the endogenous BAG3. This last experiment confirms the BAG3-penton base interaction during infectious viral cycle.",

To explore whether a similar mechanism applies to the interaction with BAG3, the experiment was performed using two mutants of the Ad2 base protein, namely DPY1 and PY2mut. The former had the first PPxY motif deleted while the latter retained both motifs but had a second proline of the second PPXY changed to alanine (see diagram Fig. 2A) . The rationale for this last mutation is based on studies identifying this residue in the PPxY motif as indispensable for interaction with WW domains [Chen et al., 1997; Pirozzi et al., 1997] . In cells co-transfected with penton base or the base mutant genes and with the BAG3 expression plasmid, the BAG3 immunoprecipitated the native form of the penton base protein and the PY2mut, but not the base devoid of the first PPXY motif (Fig. 2B , compare lanes BAG \u00fe Base and BAG \u00fe PY2mut with the lane BAG \u00fe DPY1). Of note, the synthesis of N-terminally deleted base protein is always somewhat impaired (results not shown). This result suggests that also for BAG3 the first PPxY motif in the penton base is involved in the interaction.",

It was thus of interest to determine if the ternary complex can be formed by BAG3 bearing both partners simultaneously. For this, HeLa cells were transfected with both c-myc-tagged BAG3 and Ad2 penton base-coding plasmids. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-myc, anti-Hsp70 or anti-base antibodies. Interestingly, both anti-c-myc and anti-Hsp70 antibodies brought down both tagged and endogenous BAG3 (arrowheads in Fig. 3A ). Both base protein and endogenous Hsp70 were pulled down together with BAG3. However, we excluded existence of a ternary complex by performing reciprocal immunoprecipitations in which the anti-Hsp70 antibody brought down both transfected and endogenous BAG3 co-chaperone, but was unable to precipitate the putative third component of the complex-penton base protein (Fig. 3A , column 'Base'). This experiment shows that BAG3 protein is involved in formation of two mutually exclusive complexes, either with Hsp70 or with Ad penton base.",

The mechanism of the penton base transfer to the nucleus is not clear since its sequence does not display an obvious NLS. However, the nuclear transfer of the penton base was confirmed in our hands upon the expression of the base protein alone in HeLa cells, under conditions of both transfection and virus infection (Fig. 5A) . When BAG3 was expressed in the presence of the penton base, a significant portion of GFP-BAG3 was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 5B , see panels Merge). Since this protein is predominantly displayed in the cytoplasm in the absence of Ad infection (see Fig. 4B ), these observations suggest that the penton base protein, when expressed together with BAG3, is able to transfer the attached BAG3 to the nucleus during its own nuclear transport. Similar behaviour of BAG3 and base proteins was observed upon virus infection, with a remarkably high concentration of BAG3 in the nucleus of Ad2infected cells (Fig. 5C ). Fig. 5D shows the simultaneous expression of BAG3 and penton base protein in the infected cells. Taken together these experiments show that by virtue of an interaction with a viral partner capable of efficient nuclear translocation, BAG3 cochaperone is transported into the nuclei of penton base-expressing cells, thus acquiring a new localisation upon Ad infection.",

HeLa cells depleted of BAG3 using siRNA technique (Fig. 6A , left panel) were infected with the adenovirus carrying the luciferase gene, Adluc. This recombinant virus is unable to replicate in HeLa cells but translocates the virus genome to the cell nucleus and allows luciferase expression, which permits the quantification of virus entry. Depletion of BAG3 appears to be deleterious to virus entry (Fig. 6A, right panel) . Next, BAG3-deleted cells were infected with Ad5 and analysed for the amount of progeny virus produced, taking the penton base production as a measure. During Ad replication penton base is one of three structural viral proteins produced in large amounts (the other two being the hexon and the fibre). BAG3deleted cells showed reduced virus replication, which was demonstrated by the significantly lower amount of penton base protein synthesised, as observed within the first 24 h of infection (Fig. 6B ). This effect is much less pronounced at 48 h, which might result from the high multiplicity of infection used in this experiment. Together, these experiments suggest that interaction of the penton base with BAG3 is implicated in the first stages of Ad infection-virus entry and nuclear translocation.",

The BAG3 is the only member of the BAG family cochaperones containing WW domain and since the penton base devoid of first PPxY motif is unable to interact with BAG3, it can be inferred that the first PPxY domain of the penton base and the WW domain of BAG3 jointly mediate the penton base-BAG3 interaction.

We wished to know whether the interaction with the penton base influences BAG3 function. To better understand the effect of the base protein on BAG3 co-chaperone activity, proteins derived from two different adenovirus serotypes were used-Ad2 penton base and Ad3 dodecahedron, a virus-like particle consisting of 12 bases [Fender et al., 1997] . However, both kinds of penton base proteins exerted rather weak inhibitory effects on the co-chaperone activity of BAG3 (Suppl. Mat. Fig. 1B,D) . Moreover, this negative modulation could be observed only under conditions favouring the interaction between BAG3 and base protein, for example after 1 h preincubation of the two partners prior to the assay.",

When no tertiary complex of Base-BAG3-Hsp70 is formed, penton base protein cannot affect Hsp70 chaperone activity by BAG3 intermediate, which explains a negligible effect of base presence on co-chaperone activity of BAG3. It seems therefore, that HeLa cells were infected with either BAG3 siRNA retrovirus or control retrovirus, followed by puromycin selection (1 mg/ ml), to obtain permanent knockdown cells, as described in the Materials and Methods Section. Left panel shows BAG3 expression in siRNA-treated cells as compared with untreated cells, visualised by Western blot with anti-BAG3 antibody. Actin is shown as loading control.

Luciferase activity is shown with error bar as mean AE SD (n \u00bc 5). B: BAG3 depletion results in impaired virus production measured by penton base synthesis.

This protein is also implicated in the escape of the virus from endosomes [FitzGerald et al., 1983] . In addition, since viral proteins are synthesised in the cytoplasm they have to travel to the nucleus where the assembly of Ad progeny virions takes place. It can thus be inferred that during its life cycle the penton base is involved in the host cell in a plethora of interactions that permit virus cell entry and release from endosomes, as well as viral protein synthesis, folding, oligomerisation, nuclear transport and finally virion assembly. We thought that localisation studies could be of help in elucidation of BAG3 involvement in virus life cycle. The well-studied member of a BAG co-chaperone family, BAG1, localises to both, the cytosol and nucleus [Nollen et al., 2000; Frebel et al., 2007] . However, for BAG3 we observed predominantly cytoplasmic localisation, with some overlap with an endoplasmic reticulum marker, calnexin (Fig. 4B, lower panel) . In contrast, Cterminally truncated BAG3 was found in both cytoplasm and nuclei of the transfected cells (Fig. 4C ). This suggests that the removal of the C-terminal portion of BAG3 (amino acids 445-575 which includes BAG domain) either revealed a hidden NLS or, alternatively, removed a dominant cytoplasmic retention signal. Indeed, the deleted C-terminal part of the BAG3 includes a strongly acidic/ hydrophobic fragment 455-475 containing some conserved cytoplasmic retention regions [Bertos et al., 2004] , as well as the sequence close to the consensus sequence for the nuclear export signal (NES) [Wang et al., 2004] .",

As BAG3 is unable to form a ternary complex containing both penton base and Hsp70 (Fig. 3A ), it appears that the interaction with Ad penton base is sufficient to result in the nuclear transfer of BAG3.

Under conditions of BAG3 depletion, virus entry was diminished by about half (Fig. 6A) , implying that this step is facilitated by the interaction between the penton base and BAG3. Similarly, upon decrease in BAG3 the expression of penton base protein during virus infection was diminished showing impaired virus production (Fig. 6B ).

[2007] showed that BAG3 modestly suppresses transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1, through inhibition of interaction of p65 subunit of NF-kB with the LTR. The C-terminal fragment of 167 amino acid residues of BAG3 was mapped here as potential p65-binding domain. The observed suppression level was two-to fourfold only. In contrast, Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) replication is strongly facilitated by the BAG3 [Kyratsous and Silverstein, 2008] ; ORF29p, a latency-associated VZV protein, interacts with BAG3 and BAG3 depletion with siRNA inhibits virus replication. BAG3 devoid of WW domain was still able to bind viral protein. Similarly to our observations made for the adenovirus, BAG3 was located in cytoplasm of non-infected cells and was redistributed to the nucleus upon VZV infection. In case of VZV, reduction of BAG3 level resulted in marked decrease in virus titre. In contrast, the spread of another herpesvirus, HSV, was completely unaffected by BAG3 depletion (op. cit.), even that recent data indicate on the positive effect of BAG3 on HSV replication at low multiplicity of infection [Kyratsous and Silverstein, 2008] . Interestingly, still another herpesvirus, EBV, via its EBNA3A oncoprotein, was able to induce mRNA of several chaperones, among them that of BAG3 [Young et al., 2008] . Further, BAG3 suppression with RNAi resulted in inhibition of a respiratory virus SARS-CoV replication [Zhang et al., 2010] . Thus BAG3 appears to be involved in several facets of host-virus interactions.",
