However, the current endemic strains that predictably cause epidemic disease each winter kill 30,000 to 50,000 individuals in the United States each year, and getting the 2005\u20132006 flu shot remains as important this year as ever. This shot is especially important for the elderly, the immunocompromised, pregnant women, children, and all who come in contact with these high-risk groups, including other family members, household contacts, and health care workers. Being immunized greatly reduces elderly or otherwise vulnerable persons' risk of becoming so ill with flu caused by these strains that they have to be hospitalized or die.",

Consumption of uncooked poultry or poultry products from these countries should also be avoided. Freezing and refrigeration do not substantially reduce the concentration or virulence of these viruses in meat; thus, it is essential to follow safe food-handling procedures (Table 2\n).",

Widespread, inappropriate use of these drugs may also promote drug resistance. Many health care centers, including the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, have preemptively restricted prescribing of oseltamivir, limiting it to patients with clear indications for treatment of probable influenza or its prevention. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America recently issued a joint position statement urging very restricted use of this class of anti-influenza drugs, and many state health departments have followed suit.
