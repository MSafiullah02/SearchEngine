Despite the development of antimicrobials, vaccines, and other technologic advances, infection is a leading cause of death in the developing world, and outbreaks of infectious diseases continue to influence global events, even in the twenty-first century. The appearance of emerging infectious diseases (those caused by a newly recognized agent) and reemerging infectious diseases (those caused by a known agent that has developed enhanced pathogenicity or dramatically increased in incidence) may be due to multiple factors, but perhaps the most important are the alteration of human and nonhuman ecology and environmental change. Despite the devastating effect that unrecognized and unanticipated diseases may have on the human population, the concept of \u201cemerging infections\u201d did not coalesce until the 1990s. In 1992, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences published a report that called for the establishment of programs to effectively identify, monitor, and respond to all infectious agents, including newly recognized pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The 1992 IOM report recommended strengthening communicable disease surveillance in the United States at the local, state, and federal levels; establishing a comprehensive global network for infectious disease surveillance; and supporting research to improve infectious disease detection and response. In 2003, the IOM evaluated the progress of efforts to implement their recommendations and reported that the global infrastructure to support response to emerging and reemerging infections continued to be neglected, particularly in developing regions, where many previously unrecognized human infections first appear.",

More recently, widespread outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, both initially thought to portend the next pandemic, were upstaged when a novel swine influenza caused the first pandemic of the twenty-first century.",

Two recent reports that reviewed trends in emerging infections identified several patterns of association: emerging infectious diseases of temperate regions tend to be associated with domesticated animals, advanced agriculture, and healthcare technologies, whereas those originating in tropical regions are more typically linked to human interaction with wild animals or exposure to insect vectors. Both reports called for renewed efforts to establish programs for surveillance and investigation of emerging infections that focus on these associations, allocating resources to detect novel or reemerging infections in developing regions with the greatest biodiversity and interaction between wildlife and humans.",
