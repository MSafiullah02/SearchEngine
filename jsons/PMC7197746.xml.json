Moreover, panic and uncertainty can easily be initiated using harmless mock substances in copycat attacks. Recent examples demonstrating the profound impact and consequences of even limited bioterrorist attacks include the letters containing anthrax spores that were sent shortly after the events of September 2001 (Lane et al. 2001) and the distribution of anthrax spores by the Aum cult in Japan in 1995 (Olson 1999).",

            "text": "In response to these attacks, authorities worldwide increased their preparedness for dealing with bioterrorism (e.g. Nolte et al. 2004). One major focus was to set up and improve procedures for the rapid and reliable diagnosis (or exclusion) of relevant pathogens in samples suspected to contain such organisms (Sapsford et al. 2008). Because of a number of unique advantages, electron microscopy formed an integral part of these procedures (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Miller 2003, 2004). Electron microscopy allows the direct imaging in a sample of all particles down to a size of a fraction of a nanometre and hence the instant recognition of different morphological groups of pathogens (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Curry et al. 2006). The method provides basic information on the particulate composition of a sample and therefore gives a degree of direction and control for more precise techniques (e.g. nucleic acid amplification, immunological assays) that use specific probes to detect a pathogen but which can sometimes fail if the pathogen has mutated or if detection is impaired by inhibitors. Indeed, diagnostic electron microscopy can reveal and describe new versions of a pathogen and thereby facilitate their precise identification. The importance of this approach was clearly demonstrated by the collaborative identification of the pathogen causing SARS in which electron microscopy gave the first clue that a coronavirus was responsible (World Health Organisation 2003).",

            "text": "The fastest method for diagnostic electron microscopy uses negative staining, a technique introduced by Brenner and Horne (1959). Samples, usually in the form of a suspension, are adsorbed onto the surface of a thin transparent plastic film supported by a metal grid, stained with heavy metals for stabilization and contrast (Miller 1986; Harris and Horne 1991) and then inspected using a transmission electron microscope. This whole procedure can be carried out within only a few minutes. Virus particles can usually be assigned to a particular virus family, while bacteria or fungi can only be recognized to a more general morphological group that provides direction for a more focused diagnosis (Gelderblom et al. 1991; Curry et al. 2006). Most importantly, as well as being a valuable quick and simple diagnostic technique, there is a significant amount of reference data available in the literature concerning negative staining electron microscopy (Biel and Gelderblom 1999a). However, despite having been used for many decades, quantitative data on the detection limits of the method are limited (Hammond et al. 1981; Biel and Gelderblom 1999a; Biel et al. 2004; Nitsche et al. 2007).",

            "text": "The purpose of our study was therefore to determine and to evaluate the detection limit of the negative staining technique for the diagnosis of bioterrorism\u2010relevant pathogens. As test models we used suspensions of the poxvirus vaccinia and the endospores of Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 1) to represent at least two classes of micro\u2010organisms relevant in bioterrorism (list of possible bioterrorism agents by the CDC (Centers for Disease, Control and Prevention), USA; http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp). In addition, the influence of variables during preparation (e.g. incubation time and washing) on the efficiency of detection was evaluated. Knowledge of the detection limit and a comparison with results published for negative staining of, for instance clinical specimens, is important because samples and preparations are handled differently. Samples from a suspected bioterrorist attack are usually first inactivated by chemicals or by radiation, which may interfere with adsorption to the support (see discussion in Madeley and Biel 2006; Gelderblom et al. 2007). Moreover, a diagnosis should include fungal spores and bacteria, particles that are usually denser and bigger than viruses. Adsorption and washing conditions may, according to the morphological class of particles (size, shape, density), differentially affect the number of particles bound to the grid. Finally, the results of this study are also relevant for accredidation and certification procedures carried out in diagnostic laboratories during the establishment of quality management systems aimed at improving the overall quality of diagnosis.",

Spores were harvested and washed twice in 0\u00b705 M HEPES buffer and stored in buffer at 2\u201310\u00b0C. The quality of the spore preparation was evaluated by thin section electron microscopy (Laue et al. 2007).

Spore suspensions were centrifuged, and sedimented spores were fixed with a mixture of 10% paraformaldehyde and 0\u00b705% glutaraldehyde in 0\u00b705 M HEPES buffer, pH 7\u00b72.

Three 1 ml samples of a suspension of 200\u2010nm polystyrene beads (Duke Scientific Corp.) were dried in a 37\u00b0C oven for several days. The particle concentration was calculated from the dry weight and the weight of a single particle (calculated from the bead density as provided by the producer and our own size measurements using electron microscopy). The bead suspension and the virus suspension were then mixed at a similar concentration (as determined from initial quality control experiments using negative staining electron microscopy). After adsorption onto a support for negative staining, particles were counted in the electron microscope (40 regions on four grids) and the concentration of the unknown suspension was calculated from the mean relation between particle number of known and unknown suspension determined for the different regions, taking into account all preceding dilutions.",

To increase the hydrophilicity and stickiness of the surface, grids were placed on a drop of alcian blue (Fluka, Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Munich, Germany; 1% in 1% acetic acid in water) for 10 min (Lang et al. 1981). Grids were then washed over four droplets of double\u2010distilled water, and the bulk of the water was removed from the grid surface using filter paper. The test suspension was brought into contact with the grid surface either by placing the grid, with the hydrophilic surface facing down, on a drop of the suspension (grid\u2010on\u2010drop procedure) or by adding 10 \u03bcl of the suspension to the hydrophilic surface of the grid (drop\u2010on\u2010grid procedure). After incubation for 10 min, grid surface was washed on four drops of double\u2010distilled water for 5 s each. Excess water was removed from the grid surface using a filter paper, and the grid was placed on a drop of either 0\u00b75% uranyl acetate (spores) or 1% phosphotungstic acid at neutral pH (virus) for 5 s. Finally, grids were dried using a filter paper. To ensure that the forces applied to the adsorbed particles were reproducible, grids were held perpendicular to the surface of the filter paper for all such drying steps.",

Grids were placed in adaptors (Type S/N 833101329, Beckman; No. 11093, Laborgeraete Beranek, Weinheim, Germany), which maintain the grid surface parallel to the axis of the rotor (Gelderblom 2006). Centrifuge tubes were filled with 80 \u03bcl of test suspension, and adaptors with grids in place were added. The period between filling the tubes with the test suspension and commencing centrifugation was between 7 and 10 min (for six tubes). Centrifugation was carried out for 10 min at a pressure of 20 psi which corresponds to a centrifugal force of about 120 000 g (clearing factor is approx. 15; Beckman). These values were chosen based on a calculation of the time to fully sediment virus particles of the lowest known density [i.e. 100 Svedberg; Liebermann 1978; time (h) = clearing factor/density (Svedberg)]. After adaptors were removed from the centrifuge tubes, grids were released by inverting the adapters and adding 80 \u03bcl of double\u2010distilled water to form a hanging drop. Grids were washed on two drops of double\u2010distilled water, and excess water removed using a filter paper before placing them on a drop of negative staining solution as described earlier.",

At this concentration, a median value of only one particle/22 grid squares could be detected for both suspensions of virus and of spores. Using the interquartile range as a measure of variability, it was clear that the number of particles detected can drop below 1 per 22 grid squares, i.e. no detection at all (Table 5).

Our results demonstrate that negative staining of test suspensions of bacterial endospores or poxviruses is reproducible with regard to the number of particles detected on the grid. Alcian blue pretreatment of grids seems to be a reliable procedure because it did not add significantly to the variability of the results, possibly because the treatment is applied directly before adding the sample to the grid. Moreover, alcian blue solution can be stored for at least 6 months (at 2\u201310\u00b0C) without any significant loss of efficiency, reducing the risk of impaired reproducibility in practice. Pretreatment of grids by glow discharge is very popular because it renders them hydrophilic without adding any chemicals to the surface (Reissig and Orrell 1970). However, the efficiency of binding particles to the surface is dependent on several factors of the discharge procedure (e.g. duration) and the time postdischarge (Harris 1997; Shibata and Miyazaki 2002). It is still unclear what influence these parameters have on the detection of particles. Clearly, more experiments are needed to investigate the influence of different chemical or physical grid pretreatments on the efficiency of particle adsorption.",

Without airfuge sedimentation at least 106 particles per ml and applying the suspension onto the grid (drop\u2010on\u2010grid procedure) were necessary for reliable detection. With both poxviruses and spores, the application of a drop of the test suspension onto the grid was more efficient than placing the grid onto a drop of suspension (grid\u2010on\u2010drop procedure) indicating that particle density is high enough for a sufficient sedimentation by gravity. The detection limit determined here is in the range given by other studies using virus suspensions (Katz et al. 1984; Biel and Gelderblom 1999a; Johnsen et al. 2006). However, detection is not only influenced by the concentration of the relevant particles but also by the overall composition of the suspension. Constituents of a suspension can interfere with adhesion of the particles to the grid or can cover the particles (Kurth et al. 2008) thereby reducing the likelihood of detection. The detection limit proposed in this study should therefore be examined in further experiments using mixtures of test suspensions with environmental test samples (e.g. dust, soil, drying powder) and/or clinical test samples. Moreover, the detection limit for particles possessing a density lower than that of poxviruses should be determined. Experiments using clinical samples and particle estimations based on the measurement of genomic units suggest that the detection limit under these conditions may be higher (Biel et al. 2004; Nitsche et al. 2007).",

The enrichment factor for poxviruses is similar to that given by other authors using the airfuge (M\u00fcller et al. 1981; Biel and Gelderblom 1999a), although it is difficult to make direct comparisons because the airfuge parameters were not identical and, moreover, enrichment factors were not determined at the detection limit.

In our hands, drop\u2010on\u2010grid always resulted in higher particle numbers than grid\u2010on\u2010drop. The difference between the two procedures was more pronounced with the spores than with the poxvirus test suspension, possibly because of the higher density of the spores. In this respect, it would be interesting to know at which particle density the drop\u2010on grid procedure becomes less efficient than grid\u2010on\u2010drop for a given incubation time. Because both the sedimentation and the enrichment of particles at the interface between the liquid and air or the grid surface are time\u2010dependent, it would be also helpful to know more about the kinetics of both processes.",

Particle numbers increased with time for both viruses and spores. However, while with spores the particle adsorption followed a saturation kinetic during the 20\u2010min observation time, with the virus an almost exponential increase in particle number was observed. This result can be explained by the different densities of the particles, leading to a faster sedimentation of spores than viruses. It is, however, remarkable that the virus suspension gave comparatively high particle numbers at short incubation times (i.e. 1 and 5 min). This difference may be because of a higher susceptibility of spores to removal from the grid by washing. As the detection limit is dependent on incubation time, a compromise between sensitivity and overall processing time must be found for each experiment or diagnostic test. Based on our experiments, a slight increase in the sensitivity of detection (i.e. by a factor of 1\u00b74 for spores and 2\u00b74 for virus) is likely if the incubation time is increased to 20 min.",

We showed a significant loss of particles only after two washing steps and after four washing steps (the standard used in this study) the loss was about 40% for spores and about 30% for virus particles. This difference may be related to the larger size of spores, making them more prone to removal than the smaller virus particles. Washing should therefore be reduced to a minimum to avoid a reduction in detection sensitivity and further testing should establish an optimal compromise between the visibility of particles and their retention on the grid.",

Screening 20 grid squares systematically distributed over the grid already takes approx. 10\u201315 min depending on various parameters such as staining quality, particle number, size and distribution. A possible moderate gain in detection sensitivity should therefore be carefully weighed against the loss in detection speed. Moreover, while scanning across the grid in a more or less even sampling pattern, it is possible to concentrate on certain regions of the grid that show an interesting particle distribution. Open view negative staining electron microscopy may therefore find particles that are present at a low number on the grid, somewhat lowering the detection limit in practice. However, diagnostic quality is also dependent on the competence of the electron microscopist and overall diagnostic performance must therefore be regularly evaluated by blinded testing and maintained or improved by continuous practice (Biel and Gelderblom 1999a).",

Preliminary tests using these adaptors have resulted in increased particle numbers on the grid compared to the use of adaptors with a flat recess (M. Laue, unpublished data). Other studies have used tubes and/or adaptors in conventional ultracentrifuges to apply larger volumes than can usually be achieved with the airfuge (M\u00fcller 1969; Mathews and Buthala 1970). It may be worth evaluating modern table\u2010top ultracentrifuges able to process larger volumes for their ability, by simply inserting the grids into the centrifuge tube, to deposit particles directly onto a grid. Such a direct approach has already been successfully used with the airfuge (Alain et al. 1987), resulting in almost the same particle number achieved using conventional adaptors (M.

It therefore serves as an independent control for other methods applied in parallel to identify possible bioterrorism\u2010related pathogens. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial endospores and poxviruses, two candidate pathogens for bioterrorism, can be reliably detected up to a defined detection limit under ideal conditions, even if they are modified by inactivating chemicals.
