            "text": "In dogs, feces quality can be influenced by own characteristics of the dog (breed size and age), digestive pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and parasites), diet (change without transition, type and quality of food), lifestyle and environment (stress) (Weber et al., 2002, Weber et al., 2003, Sokolow et al., 2005, Hernot et al., 2006, Stavisky et al., 2011). Various fecal scales have been proposed to evaluate feces quality in adult dogs (Meyer et al., 1999, Rolfe et al., 2002a, Rolfe et al., 2002b, Propst et al., 2003, Hernot et al., 2006, Allenspach et al., 2007). These scales are divided in 4\u201310 points, with lower grades corresponding to either dry feces or diarrhea, and with an optimal fecal score varying from 2 to 7.5 (Rolfe et al., 2002a, Rolfe et al., 2002b, Hernot et al., 2005, Allenspach et al., 2007). Digestive health is particularly challenged in puppies around the weaning period. Weaning is associated with major changes in food intake, together with profound environmental and social modifications. Besides these major alterations in digestive balance, the weaning period is associated with a high incidence of some gastro-intestinal pathogens. All these factors can affect feces quality and reduce the average daily gain (ADG). Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2) is frequently isolated in puppies from shelters (Marshall et al., 1984, Vanparijs et al., 1991, Naylor et al., 2001) and was reported to have a major impact on feces quality at weaning (Schulz et al., 2008). Canine coronavirus (CCV) is also frequently identified in the feces of puppies but its role in the etiology of acute diarrhea remains controversial (Tennant et al., 1993, Yesilbag et al., 2004).",

Scoring systems used in adult dogs cannot be applied to young puppies because of a physiological lower fecal quality prior to the weaning period (Giffard et al., 2004). No study has defined an abnormal fecal score during the weaning period. The objectives of this study were thus to determine in puppies a threshold in fecal score that could be regarded as pathological, based on its correlation with a drop average daily gain, and to evaluate the association between pathological scores and digestive infection by CPV2 or CCV.",

The analyses were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse-transcriptase PCR, for CPV2 and CCV detection, respectively, in a 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Villebon sur Yvette, France). Five microliters of eluate was used for PCR and absence of PCR inhibitors was checked for each eluate. The detection threshold of the CPV2 real-time PCR (i.e. the lower number of genomic copies detected in 95% of runs) is 4 copies of genomic DNA VP2 template. The quantification threshold is 200 copies. These were determined by probit analysis as recommended by European Pharmacopeia for PCR assays assessment. The detection and quantification thresholds for canine coronavirus detection are, respectively, 36 and 200 copies of genomic RNA. Results from duplicate analysis (mean of the two results) were expressed semi-quantitatively as 5 viral load levels (Table 2\n). For CPV2, viral load levels have been determined in asymptomatic non-vaccinated, asymptomatic vaccinated or diseased dogs with confirmed parvovirosis (histolopathologic exam and/or positive testing using antigen assays). High and very high viral loads as defined in Table 2 are typical loads in dogs with parvovirosis and correlated to positive antigen testing and detection of wild-type strains of virus, i.e. CPV2a, b or c (unpublished results). In vaccinated dogs the CPV2 viral loads are mostly low or very low but sometimes may be medium especially when the dog has been vaccinated a few days before sampling with high-titer vaccines. Whatever the vaccine used we neither obtained high viral loads of vaccine strain even in the days after vaccination (unpublished results). As far as CCV is concerned, the viral load levels have been arbitrary defined on the basis of several hundreds of tests in asymptomatic or diarrheic puppies from different breeds.",

The maternally derived antibodies (MDA), acquired by ingestion of immunoglobulin-rich colostrum, are essential for the protection of puppies against neonatal infection and death (Day, 2007). However during the weaning period, MDAs may interfere with an active immune response to vaccine administration, but the low titers do not prevent infection with a virulent virus (Chappuis, 1998). So puppies are sensitive to infection by intestinal pathogens such as parvoviruses. Most earlier studies considered only the aspects of feces (consistency, color\u2026) to define \u201cdiarrhea\u201d and to evaluate the impact of enteropathogens on feces quality (Finlaison, 1995, Del Amo et al., 1999, Sokolow et al., 2005). However, young puppies have a higher fecal moisture content (Weber et al., 2003) and a lower fecal quality (Giffard et al., 2004) which may be related to a relatively low total mucosal surface (Paulsen et al., 2003) or to faster gastric emptying (Miyabayashi and Morgan, 1991, Weber et al., 2002). So, digestive disorders may be overestimated in studies considering all soft feces as abnormal. An objective definition of abnormal feces in puppies appeared desirable. This study was designed to propose a fecal scoring scale for puppies in the weaning period, i.e. at 6\u20138 weeks of age and to provide an objective definition of an abnormal fecal score, based on a reduction in the average daily weight gain.",

Both viruses were isolated from all feces samples collected. Earlier serological and virological studies had demonstrated that puppies and dogs from kennels and animal shelters are particularly exposed to these infections (Rimmelzwaan et al., 1991, Tennant et al., 1993, Bandai et al., 1999, Naylor et al., 2001, Yesilbag et al., 2004, Schulz et al., 2008). The high prevalence observed here reflects the high contagiosity of these two viruses. Whereas viruses identified in the feces may sign the excretion of a wild viral strain, the low level of CPV2 detected in 87.3% of the feces may also result from vaccination. Puppies in our study were vaccinated at 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age with a non-adjuvant, modified live-vaccine containing a type 2 parvovirus strain. The use of such vaccines has been associated with fecal excretion of the vaccinal virus, the excretion remaining nevertheless markedly lower than in the case of a natural infection (Carmichael et al., 1981). The PCR assay used in this study has been shown to detect viruses in the feces of low-grade shedding animals (Desario et al., 2005, Schmitz et al., 2009).",

These healthy looking animals may however become major sources of virus for other animals. Whereas we confirmed the impact of CPV2 on fecal quality, we did not evidence any influence of CCV infection on the fecal score, whatever the amount excreted (Fig. 4). This virus is a common pathogen in dogs, but its actual role in acute dog diarrhea remains controversial (Tennant et al., 1993, Yesilbag et al., 2004). An interaction between CCV and CPV2 (aggravation of clinical signs in dogs infected by both viruses) was observed in 8 week old puppies under experimental condition (Appel, 1988). This interaction was not observed in our study.",
