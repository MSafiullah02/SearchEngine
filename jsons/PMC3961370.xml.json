Bat populations may serve as a major reservoir for emerging human viral infections [2]\u2013[5]. Genus Orthoreovirus is one of 15 recognized genera in Family Reoviridae, a large, diverse group of non-enveloped viruses with segmented, double-stranded RNA genomes [6]. Several novel orthoreoviruses of pteropine origin have recently been isolated, and six of these isolates were associated with acute respiratory infections in humans [7]\u2013[11]. Moreover, a serological survey revealed 13% of 109 random serum samples of subjects in Malaysia were seropositive for pteropine reoviruses [12], indicating zoonotic transmission of fusogenic bat reoviruses may be a frequent event. Monitoring agencies have recommended close monitoring of orthoreovirus evolution, as well as a necessity for further research to allow for prevention and control measures to be taken in the event of zoonotic transmission [13].",

Human infections with non-fusogenic mammalian reoviruses (MRVs) are commonplace and generally asymptomatic [15]. In contrast, natural infections with fusogenic orthoreoviruses induce an array of pathologies in virus-infected animals; baboon reovirus (BRV) is associated with meningoencephalomyelitis in juvenile baboons [16], reptilian reoviruses (RRVs) cause pneumonia and neurological dysfunction [17], [18], and avian reoviruses (ARVs) are the causative agents of a wide range of diseases that include arthritis and enteric disease syndromes [19]. Syncytium formation is mediated by non-structural, fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins encoded by all fusogenic orthoreoviruses, and by fusogenic aquareoviruses in the closely related Genus Aquareovirus\n[20]. These are the only known membrane fusion proteins encoded by non-enveloped viruses. The FAST proteins are not involved in viral entry, but instead induce fusion between virus-infected and neighboring uninfected cells, thereby promoting virus dissemination [21]. The extent of syncytiogenesis correlates with viral pathogenicity [22], and mice intranasally infected with a chimeric, FAST protein-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) showed increased neuropathology [23]. The FAST proteins are therefore virulence determinants of the fusogenic reoviruses.",

Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests the fusogenic reoviruses arose from an ancestral, non-fusogenic virus by at least two separate gain-of-function events, possibly involving divergent evolution from one or more precursor non-structural proteins that were membrane-interactive, but non-fusogenic, [20], [30]. The FAST proteins share no identifiable sequence similarity with each other, or with any other known membrane fusion protein, and each possesses a unique repertoire and arrangement of functional motifs. Defining attributes of family members include their small size (95\u2013198 amino acids), presence of a single-pass transmembrane domain (TMD) with Nexoplasmic/Cendoplasmic membrane topology resulting in ectodomains of <40 residues, sites for fatty-acid modification (N-terminal myristoylation or palmitoylation of membrane proximal Cys residues), a cluster of membrane-proximal basic residues on the cytoplasmic side of the TMD, a short hydrophobic or amphipathic motif that can be located on either side of the TMD, and an intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic tail [25], [27], [31]\u2013[33]. Determining how these motifs function in a coordinated manner to mediate membrane fusion is critical to our understanding of how these unusual viral fusion proteins mediate syncytiogenesis, and how this process influences viral pathogenesis.",

Although enveloped virus fusion proteins possess considerable architectural diversity, remarkable similarities exist in the dynamic structural rearrangements undertaken throughout the fusion reaction [35]. Triggered conformational changes result in extensive structural remodeling of complex, multimeric ectodomains that expose and project hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs) toward the target cell membrane, followed by folding back of the extended intermediate structure into a compact trimeric hairpin structure. FPs are critical for fusion activity, they are extremely sensitive to mutation, and can exist as either internal fusion loops or as N-terminal \u03b1-helices [36]. Membrane merger is believed to be mediated by bilayer deformation, using the energy released as the metastable, pre-fusion structure transitions to the lowest energy, post-fusion conformation and/or by membrane curvature effects induced by FP partitioning into bilayers [34], [37]. Membrane-proximal external regions (MPERs) of several enveloped viral fusion proteins have also been shown to play active roles in the membrane fusion reaction [38]\u2013[41]. These short, hydrophobic, frequently tryptophan-rich sequences partition into lipid bilayers where they may influence bilayer stabilization or curvature [42]. Despite extensive study of numerous enveloped virus fusogens, a clear picture on the specific role of FPs, MPERS, and quaternary structural transitions in the fusion reaction has not emerged.",

As nonstructural proteins involved in cell-cell fusion, not virus-cell fusion, the relationship between syncytium formation and viral pathogenesis can also be analyzed in the absence of confounding virus entry effects. The p10 proteins are the only FAST proteins with numerous homologs, which segregate into two host-specific clades (Figure 1); an avian clade and the newly emerged pteropine reoviruses associated with severe human respiratory infections. The rate of syncytiogenesis varies considerably between representatives of the avian and pteropine clades [21]. There is extensive sequence divergence between p10 clades (<30% amino acid identity), but they share an identical arrangement of structural motifs (Figure 1). The ARV and NBV p10 FAST proteins comprise a central transmembrane domain flanked by approximately equal sized (\u223c40 residue) ecto- and endodomains (Figure 1). The ectodomain contains a moderately hydrophobic region, termed the hydrophobic patch (HP), flanked by two conserved Cys residues, which were shown to form an intramolecular disulfide bond, creating an 11-residue cystine loop FP [43], [44]. The ectodomain also contains a 9-residue conserved motif (CM) of unknown function that is invariant in all p10 isolates. The endodomain is the most diverged region of p10, but contains two conserved Cys residues immediately adjacent to the TMD, which in ARV p10 were shown to be palmitoylated [45], followed by a short region of moderately conserved basic residues known as the polybasic (PB) motif (Figure 1); both of these endodomain motifs are required for syncytium formation [45]. To date, relatively little attention has been given to bat reovirus p10 proteins, or to exploiting comparative approaches using the two p10 clades to better define structure-function relationships.",

Further fine structure mapping revealed the 40-residue ectodomain contains two distinct functional motifs, both of which are essential for syncytiogenesis: an N-terminal \u223c25-residue motif governing formation of a cystine loop FP, and a C-terminal 13-residue membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) directing p10 multimerization and clustering into plasma membrane microdomains.

Using sequential PCR reactions, the homologous ectodomains, TMDs and endodomains of ARV and NBV p10 were exchanged to generate six chimeric p10 proteins (Figure 2A). Chimeras were named to reflect the proportion of domains stemming from each parental p10 protein. For example, the chimeric ARV protein containing the NBV ectodomain is termed ARVectoNBV (abbreviated AectoN). FACS analysis and western blotting indicated no significant differences in cell surface and total expression levels of FLAG-tagged versions of the chimeric proteins (Figure 2B). Quantitative syncytiogenesis assays revealed the relative contribution of each domain to the overall syncytiogenic rate (Figure 2C). Exchanging the TMDs or endodomains of ARV and NBV p10 had no effect on the rate or extent of syncytium formation; AtmN and AendoN had identical syncytiogenic kinetics as parental ARV p10 (Figure 2C, bottom two panels). The same situation applied for NBV p10 containing an ARV p10 TMD or endodomain (i.e. NtmA and NendoA chimeras), both of which shared the fusogenic activity of the parental NBV p10 (Figure 2C, bottom two panels). In contrast, an NBV ectodomain substantially increased the syncytiogenic activity of ARV p10 while an ARV ectodomain impaired the fusogenic activity of NBV p10 (Figure 2C, top panel). Interestingly, the two ectodomain chimeras had intermediate syncytiogenic activities relative to the parental p10 proteins, indicating the ectodomains directly contribute to the differing fusion activities of ARV and NBV p10 but require a homotypic TMD or endodomain to confer the full fusion phenotype of the parental proteins.",

Both ectodomain peptides displayed robust, dose-dependent lipid mixing activity, with the NBV peptide inducing approximately twice the extent of lipid mixing as the ARV peptide in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2D).

Quantitative syncytiogenesis assays revealed chimeras composed of residues exchanged within or flanking the HP were all inactive for syncytium formation (Figure 3B). A cell-surface biotinylation assay, previously employed to identify a cysteine loop in ARV p10 [43], determined NBV p10 also forms a cystine loop; cells had to be treated with DTT before plasma-membrane localized NBV p10 could react with the thiol-specific biotinylation reagent (Figure 3C). More notably, fusion-dead ARV and NBV p10 constructs (A1\u2013A3 and N1\u2013N3) could all be biotinylated without DTT treatment, indicating the presence of free thiols and inability to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Conversely, constructs with substitutions flanking the CM (A4, A5, N4 and N5) remained fusion-active (Figure 3B) and retained the cystine loop (Figure 3C).

A C9S substitution in ARV p10, which abrogates cystine loop formation and syncytiogenesis [43], had no effect on p10 clustering (Figure S2C), indicating the cystine loop FP motif does not influence p10 cell surface distribution. To determine whether the CM plays any role in p10 microdomain association, each non-Ala/Gly residue of the ARV p10 CM was individually point-substituted with either a conserved residue or with Ala, while each Ala/Gly residue was individually substituted to the obverse (Figure 5A). Surface immunofluorescence and syncytiogenesis assays with these 14 CM point substitutions revealed changes to the CM eliminated p10-induced syncytium formation (Figure 5A) and generated a diffuse surface-staining pattern (Figure 5B, top and middle rows). The four diverged, juxtamembrane residues of the MPER, hereinafter referred to as the neck region, connect the TMD to the CM and can be exchanged in the ARV and NBV p10 proteins with no effects on syncytiogenesis (Figure 3B). However, substitution of these neck residues with Ala had the same effect as CM substitutions, abrogating both p10-induced syncytium formation (Figure 5A) and clustering in membrane microdomains (Figure 5B, bottom row). The p10 MPER, encompassing CM and neck residues, therefore governs the essential clustering of p10 in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.",

To further explore the relationship between microdomain association and fusion activity, syncytium formation was assessed in QM5 cells co-transfected with a parental p10 protein and equivalent amounts of plasmid DNA expressing one of several chimeric or substituted constructs that had various effects on p10 clustering and syncytiogenesis. Co-transfecting cells with the same parental p10 (i.e. twice the dose of p10-expressing plasmid DNA) increased syncytiogenesis \u223c50\u2013100% relative to cells co-transfected with empty vector (e.g., ARV+ARV relative to ARV+vector, and NBV+NBV relative to NBV+vector; Figure 6A). Co-expressing parental p10 with constructs defective in both syncytium formation and clustering (e.g. CM mutants or Ala substitutions of the neck regions) had the same effect as co-transfecting empty vector; these constructs had no effect on parental p10-induced syncytiogenesis (Figure 6A). Co-expressing the ARV p10 C9S mutant, which is fusion-incompetent but retains the MPER homotypic microdomain association motif, eliminated ARV p10-induced syncytium formation but had no effect on NBV p10 syncytiogenesis (Figure 6B). Conversely, a C9S substitution in an ARV p10 A5 background (i.e., ARV p10 containing the NBV p10 neck region) suppressed NBV p10-induced syncytium formation by \u223c99% (Figure 6B). Varying the proportion of functional NBV p10 and non-functional ARV A5 C9S yielded a dose-response curve, with 50% maximal syncytiogenesis occurring at a functional\u2236non-functional p10 ratio of \u223c4\u22361 (Figure 6C). Fusion-deficient constructs therefore exert a potent dominant-negative effect, but only when co-localized to the same membrane microdomain as a parental p10 protein. Lastly, co-expressing ARV or NBV p10 with heterotypic neck region substitution constructs that co-localize with each other (i.e., ARV p10 with NBV N5, or NBV p10 with ARV A5 in Figure 5D) resulted in approximately equivalent, intermediate fusion phenotypes; syncytium formation was more extensive than that induced by ARV p10 alone but reduced relative to NBV p10 alone (Figure 6A). Taken together, these results indicate each punctum represents a \u201cfusion unit\u201d, with overall fusion efficiency being dictated by the population of p10 proteins present in individual puncta.",

ARV and NBV p10 proteins were C-terminally tagged with either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a monomeric derivative of red fluorescent protein (mCherry), a FRET pair with good spectral overlap but low donor-acceptor cross-talk levels [50]. The PixFRET Image-J plug-in [51] was used to calculate donor and acceptor spectral bleed-through (SBT) values and normalized FRET (NFRET) intensities using pixel-by-pixel analysis of sensitized emission FRET, and mean NFRET (mNFRET) values were determined for 10 cells in each of two separate experiments. Positive controls included a uni-molecular FRET pair (i.e., EGFP directly attached to mCherry via a flexible linker) and a bi-molecular FRET pair, the multimeric p14 FAST protein, both of which gave positive FRET signals (Figure 7A). The negative controls, ARV-GFP co-expressed with free mCherry (Figure 7B) and ARV-mCherry co-expressed with free GFP (data not shown), yielded no detectible FRET signals.",

Similarly, co-expressing ARV p10-GFP with mCherry-tagged ARV p10 containing either Ala substitutions of the four neck residues (A-neck construct) or the heterologous neck residues from NBV p10 (ARV A5 construct) eliminated the FRET signal, as did similar co-transfections with NBV p10 constructs (Figure 8A); all of these neck constructs also abrogated fusion activity and p10 clustering in the plasma membrane (Figure 5). Conversely, co-expression of ARV p10 with the NBV N5 construct (NBV p10 with the four neck residues of ARV p10), or co-expression of NBV p10 with the corresponding ARV A5 construct, both generated positive FRET signals (Figure 8A) and co-clustered in the plasma membrane (Figure 5). Additionally, cholesterol extraction with M\u03b2CD eliminated the detectible FRET signal (Figure 8B), indicating p10 multimerization and p10 clustering in the plasma membrane are both cholesterol-dependent.

Understanding what dictates the fusogenic capacity of the FAST proteins is therefore of some interest. Our comparative analysis of the homologous avian and pteropine orthoreovirus p10 FAST proteins revealed the small ectodomains of these rudimentary fusogens operate as remarkably compact, multifunctional fusion modules that function as the predominant determinant of species-specific p10 fusion efficiency. Mechanistically, the ectodomain comprises two separate components, one of which directs formation of a cystine loop FP and the other co-dependent clustering and multimerization of p10 in plasma membrane microdomains. Plasma membrane clustering and multimerization are cholesterol-dependent, required for syncytiogenesis, reversible, and governed by the MPER, which includes a juxtamembrane tetra-peptide solely responsible for species-specific p10 clustering in microdomains and homomultimerization. Most notably, co-transfections revealed that overall syncytiogenic efficiency is dictated by the p10 composition of individual microdomains, identifying these p10 plasma membrane clusters as multimeric FAST protein fusion platforms.",

            "text": "Differences in p10 fusion efficiency map primarily to the more conserved ectodomain rather than to the highly diverged endodomains (44% versus 19% sequence identity, respectively). While fusion efficiency correlated with the parental source of the ectodomain, chimeras required a homotypic TMD or endodomain to display the full fusion capacity of the parental p10 protein contributing the ectodomain. A similar situation occurs with influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), although in this instance it reflects the preference for a homotypic combination of TMD and endodomain [52]. How these individual domains function in concert during the fusion process has not been determined, either for the FAST proteins or for enveloped virus fusogens. However, prior studies determined FAST protein TMDs and endodomains are required for fusion pore formation and expansion [32], [53], [54], while their ectodomains mediate the early lipid mixing stage of membrane fusion [43], [44], [47], [55]. Ectodomain-mediated lipid mixing leading to pore formation may therefore be more efficient when pore stabilization and expansion are mediated by a homotypic TMD and/or endodomain.",

Changing the clustering pattern of p10 by exchanging MPER neck motifs did not alter syncytiogenic activity of the parental p10 constructs. For example, the A5 construct (ARV p10 with an NBV neck) had an NBV plasma membrane segregation phenotype (Figure 5) but an ARV p10 fusion phenotype (Figure 3), indicating fusion efficiency is not affected by the species-specific microdomain with which p10 associates. Lipid mixing activities of the p10 ectodomain peptides did, however, correlate with p10 fusion efficiency (Figure 2D). The ARV p10 ectodomain was recently shown to form an essential cystine loop FP [43], results we have now extended to NBV p10 (Figure 3). Furthermore, the ARV and NBV cystine loops are not interchangeable, a reflection of the remarkable sensitivity of disulfide bond formation to species-specific sequences within, and flanking, the p10 loop (Figure 3). Remarkably, despite the extreme sensitivity of disulfide bond formation to minor sequence changes, substitutions in the CM (D31E and T35A) that disrupt clustering and multimerization did not affect disulfide bond formation (Figures 5 and 8), indicating monomeric p10 contains the essential cystine loop FP and is theoretically functional (see below). The N-terminal 21\u201325 residues of p10 have therefore evolved as an independent structural and functional motif whose sequence-specific geometry is required for formation or stability of an essential cystine loop FP.",

            "text": "We also identified a second independent ectodomain motif that defines a new role for a viral fusogen MPER, namely cholesterol-dependent homomultimerization. MPERs in viral fusogens tend to be short (\u223c10\u201320 residues), hydrophobic or amphiphilic sequences frequently enriched in aromatic residues [42]. Their ability to adopt amphipathic helical structures, self-aggregate, and partition into membrane interfacial regions suggests the role of MPERs in membrane fusion reflects their ability to perturb bilayer structure [38], [39], [41], [56], [57]. In contrast, the 13-residue MPERs of ARV and NBV p10 are mostly polar and almost devoid of aromatic residues, and their essential role in membrane fusion is to direct reversible, cholesterol-dependent p10 multimerization. Although noted as an invariant sequence in all p10 isolates from avian and pteropine hosts, no functions have previously been ascribed to the CM. FRET analysis and a panel of CM point substitutions suggested a striking requirement for sequence-specific, spatial self-complementarity in the CM to generate a binding interface suitable for p10 multimerization. While homotypic CM interactions are necessary for multimerization, they are not sufficient; stable multimerization only occurred in conjunction with cholesterol-dependent clustering of p10 in plasma membrane microdomains. Cholesterol-dependent lateral segregation of proteins and lipids creates submicroscopic membrane domains with unique biophysical properties, such as increased membrane thickness and altered lipid order [58]; these or other features of lipid microdomains appear to be needed to stabilize low-affinity p10 multimer interactions. Similar co-dependent raft assembly and multimerization have been reported in other systems [59]\u2013[61]. While cholesterol microdomains have been implicated in the function of numerous enveloped virus fusogens [62], we are unaware of any instance where they are needed for enveloped virus fusogen multimerization. The one exception is Semliki Forest virus E1, where FP binding to sterol- and sphingolipid-rich microdomains in the target membrane is required for low-pH-dependent conversion of E1 pre-fusion heterodimers to fusion active homotrimers [63]. In contrast, the cholesterol-dependence of p10 multimerization reflects an undefined functional interaction between the MPER and donor membrane cholesterol needed to convert p10 monomers to stable multimers.",

The ARV p10 construct containing the neck region of NBV (A5 construct) co-clusters with NBV p10 (Figure 5), while an ARV p10 C9S substitution prevents formation of the cystine loop and eliminates cell-cell fusion (Figure 5) but has no effect on p10 homotypic clustering (Figure S2C). Co-expression of NBV p10 with an equimolar amount of an A5 construct containing the C9S substitution resulted in a 99.15% decrease in NBV p10 syncytiogenesis (Figure 6B). Assuming incorporation of one non-functional p10 polypeptide into a punctum is sufficient to eliminate fusion activity of the complex, then the 0.85\u00b10.53% (SEM, n = 3) of retained syncytiogenic activity would be attributable to clusters containing only parental NBV p10. Based on a binomial distribution, the probability of this percent of clusters containing just parental NBV p10 polypeptides is best approximated by heptameric or octameric clustering (probability of 0.78% and 0.39%, respectively). This interpretation assumes there is a single fusion site formed per cell. It is likely that several functional \u201cfusion platforms\u201d are formed on a single cell. By varying the proportion of functional NBV p10 and non-functional ARV A5 C9S (Figure 6C), we were able to consider the influence of multiple fusion sites on our previous analysis, as previously reported for rabies virus G protein [64]. Residual fusion activity should equal  (equation 1), where f is the proportion of functional p10 proteins, n is the number of p10 proteins in a cluster, and s is the number of fusion sites. Fitting our titration data (Figure 6C) to this equation returned best-fit values of n = 8.74\u00b10.70 and s = 5.17\u00b10.94. We interpret these estimates as an indicator that clusters comprise higher-order assemblies of p10 monomers in the range of octamers.",

            "text": "Cholesterol-dependent, higher-order multimerization is evident with other proteins, such as HIV-1 Gag, where initial membrane binding by lower-order (dimers) Gag multimers progresses to higher-order Gag-Gag interactions in lipid rafts [65]\u2013[67]. The clear correlation between p10 clustering and multimerization in membrane microdomains with p10 fusion competency also suggests microdomains increase local plasma membrane concentrations of p10 to generate fusion platforms, similar to cholesterol-dependent assembly of exocytic SNARE complexes into fusion sites [68]. This conclusion is strengthened by results indicating only non-functional constructs that co-clustered and co-multimerized with parental p10 proteins exerted dominant-negative effects. For example, CM substitutions (D31E and T35A) display a diffuse plasma membrane staining pattern (Figure 5B), do not multimerize with ARV p10 (Figure 8) and exert no dominant-negative effects (Figure 6A). Conversely, fusion dead constructs that colocalized with parental p10 (e.g. ARV p10 C9S) inhibited parental fusion activity (Figure 6B), while functional neck region chimeras generated heterotypic puncta and a syncytiogenic phenotype intermediate between ARV and NBV p10 proteins (Figure 6A). Overall syncytiogenic efficiency is therefore determined not by the number of p10 microdomains but by their compositional p10 bias, indicating individual puncta define a fusion unit.",

            "text": "While the CM and neck region of the MPER both control microdomain association and multimerization, the tetra-peptide neck is solely responsible for segregation of p10 into species-specific microdomains. How proteins partition into lipid rafts remains an unresolved issue in membrane biology [58]. Recent developments in the field suggest the presence of compositionally distinct membrane microdomains differing in their lipid composition, length and asymmetry of N-acyl fatty acids, and hydration status of polar headgroups. These biophysical properties provide lipid environments capable of discriminating between different membrane-associated proteins [69]. For example, HIV env and Ebola GP segregate to different lipid microdomains, both of which can be recruited by Gag to generate HIV particles with a single type of glycoprotein [70]. Proteins may also directly contribute to raft heterogeneity by specifically recruiting and stabilizing a localized lipid environment. Palmitoylation of membrane-proximal cysteines and hydrophobic matching between the lengths of acyl chains and TMDs are the two most common protein features associated with raft recruitment and protein localization to membrane microdomains [71], [72]. As we now show, MPERs can also function as microdomain sorting signals. The tetra-peptide neck of p10 provides a remarkably specific sorting signal capable of segregating two homologous membrane proteins into distinct cholesterol-dependent microdomains. This sorting event occurs in the plasma membrane, and is fully reversible following cholesterol depletion and repletion.",

            "text": "There are several feasible explanations for how the p10 neck might provide both microdomain and multimerization specificity. In a protein-centric-model, the neck would function as the specificity determinant of the MPER multimerization motif, directing homotypic lower-order multimerization. Lipid recruitment by these p10 nanoclusters to generate a sterically favored lipid environment would then recruit additional monomers or lower-order multimers to create a fusion platform. In a lipid-centric model, the tetra-peptide p10 sorting signal functions primarily as a lipid recognition or adaptation motif. Neck residues could interact with specific lipid headgroups in the exoplasmic leaflet, similar to the reported cholesterol-binding activity of the conserved LWYIK juxtamembrane peptide of HIV gp41 [73]. Alternately, the neck may affect hydrophobic matching of the p10 TMD to acyl chain lengths of adjacent lipids. Recent molecular dynamic simulations and studies in artificial bilayers indicate cholesterol decreases the effects of hydrophobic mismatch by altering bilayer thickness and lipid packing, and by inducing changes in TMD helix length [71]. We note that the ARV and NBV p10 necks display very different arrangements of polar and non-polar residues (Figure 1); ARV p10 has a polar-apolar-TMD arrangement while NBV p10 is apolar-polar-TMD. These different arrangements may influence cholesterol-mediated hydrophobic matching and lateral segregation of ARV and NBV p10 into distinct lipid microenvironments. The co-dependent and inseparable relationship between p10 multimerization and microdomain clustering makes it unclear, in either protein- or lipid-centric models, whether p10 associates with, or assembles, lipid rafts to promote multimerization.",

            "text": "Lastly, the readily reversible nature of p10 multimerization in the plasma membrane was an intriguing, and potentially functionally significant, observation. In contrast to the functionally reversible nature of p10 multimerization, enveloped fusogens are locked in metastable dimeric or trimeric pre-fusion conformations that generally undergo an irreversible conformational conversion to a post-fusion, stable trimeric conformation, releasing energy to drive the fusion reaction [34], [36]. Thermodynamically favorable, reversible p10 multimerization implies fusion is not dependent on such energy releasing conformational changes. Furthermore, the co-dependence of multimerization and microdomain association suggests p10 may be capable of shuttling in and out of lipid rafts during the fusion reaction, similar to what occurs with the fusion machinery during peroxisome fusion [74]. Taken together with results indicating monomeric p10 still contains the essential cystine noose FP, this suggests there may be a role for reversible p10 multimerization during the fusion process. Interestingly, conformational changes of enveloped virus fusogens during transition from the pre-fusion structure to the post-fusion, trimeric hairpin conformation are impossible unless the ternary structure is dissociated [75]. Recent studies suggest that monomeric intermediates exist for both tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus E [76] and VSV G fusion proteins [77]. Monomeric intermediates and dynamic clustering and dispersion of protein fusogens at sites of fusion, either raft-mediated or otherwise, may therefore be a functionally relevant feature of viral fusogens.",

A Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) 510 equipped with a META detector was used in wide field mode to detect sensitized emission FRET. Cells were imaged under a 100\u00d7 oil immersion, 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective. EGFP was excited using a 40 mW Argon laser at 488 nm, and mCherry was excited using a HeNe 548 nm laser. For microscope set-up and control experiments, additional transfections of free EGFP alone, free mCherry alone, free EGFP and free mCherry together, and EGFP directly linked to mCherry (EGFP-mCherry) were done concurrently. The donor and acceptor spectral bleed-through (SBT) values were visually minimized using the free EGFP and free mCherry samples, respectively, prior to detecting FRET in sample conditions. Donor and acceptor SBT ratios were modeled using exponential relationships with fluorophore intensity after exclusion of aberrant background values at low intensities and the application of a Gaussian blur. With the SBT values determined, the normalized FRET (NFRET) for the p10-p10 interaction was calculated. A series of three images was acquired for each cell imaged: (1) sensitized emission FRET image (donor excitation, acceptor emission; (2) donor image (donor excitation, donor emission); and (3) acceptor image (acceptor excitation, acceptor emission). Background subtraction and Gaussian blur of the donor, acceptor and FRET channels were performed on each image stack prior to analysis. Ten images were acquired for each sample condition in duplicate (total of twenty images). Using the PixFRET Image J plugin [51], the FRET intensity of each pixel was normalized to the donor and acceptor expression levels by dividing the FRET-channel pixel intensity by the square-root of the product of the corresponding donor- and acceptor-channel pixels using equation (3):(3)This normalization provided a measure of sensitized emission FRET that is comparable between different samples [80]. Pixel amplitude distributions of the 8-bit NFRET images generated by the PixFRET software were summarized as histograms with a bin width of 0.03906 NFRET units. Each histogram was fit with four Gaussian distributions, and that with the highest calculated R2 value was used for further analysis. The mean NFRET (mNFRET) was determined for each image from the best-fit Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian-fitted NFRET histograms were also used to calculate the average pixel amplitude from each condition.",
