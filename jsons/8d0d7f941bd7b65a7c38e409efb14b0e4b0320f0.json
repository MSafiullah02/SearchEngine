The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. We have previously demonstrated that unfractionated heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, induces a conformational change and have reported the structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These findings may have further implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins, as well as for nextgeneration, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.",

Furthermore, the closely related glycosaminoglycan (GAG) member, heparan sulfate (HS), is known to bind CoV surface proteins and to be used by coronavirus for its attachment to target cells 10 . Low molecular weight heparins are derived from unfractionated heparin by different chemical and enzymatic depolymerisation processes.

Protein expression was carried out in MagicMedia\u2122 E. coli Expression Media (Invitrogen, UK) at 30\u00b0C for 24 hrs, 250 rpm. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 5 mL lysis buffer (BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent, Merck Millipore, UK; containing DNAse) and incubated at room temperature for 30 mins. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies using IMAC chromatography under denaturing conditions. On-column protein refolding was performed by applying a gradient with decreasing concentrations of the denaturing agent (6 -0 M Urea). After extensive washing, protein was eluted using 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4; Lonza, UK) using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, UK).

All spectra obtained were the mean of five independent scans, following instrument calibration with camphorsulfonic acid. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to spectral analysis) using a 5 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at 12,000 g, thrice and CD spectra were collected using 21 \u03bcl of a 0.6 mg.ml -1 solution in PBS, pH 7.4. Spectra of UFH (porcine mucosal heparin) and LMWHs were collected in the same buffer at approximately comparable concentrations, since these are disperse materials. Collected data were analysed with Spectral Manager II software prior to processing with GraphPad Prism 7, using second order polynomial smoothing through 21 neighbours. Secondary structural prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server 11 .To ensure that the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence UFH or LMWH alone did not arise from simply from the addition of the carbohydrate (this class of carbohydrates are known to possess CD spectrum at high concentrations 12,13 ), the difference spectrum was analysed for each carbohydrate in order to verify that the change in the CD spectrum arose from a conformational change following binding to the test carbohydrate.",
