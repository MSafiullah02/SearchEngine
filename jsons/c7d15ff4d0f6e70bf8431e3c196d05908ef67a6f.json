            "text": "Astute observation of unanticipated results has often contributed to scientific breakthroughs. As famously said by Louis Pasteur, \"chance favors the prepared mind\". To explore biology, screening for small molecules that perturb processes has been a fruitful approach by providing the means to dissect the role of individual actors in complex biological networks. With the advent of automation, much effort has been devoted to increase our capability for discovery-driven research and to investigate the millions of interactions that make up a biological organism. Combinatorial chemistry has enabled small teams of chemists, as well as academic laboratories, to prepare large compound libraries. As for screening, the 96-well plate has gradually been substituted by the 386-or 1544-well plate, reducing the sample requirement from 50 \u00b5L/well to 5 \u00b5L/well. This means that 10 000 compounds now require a total volume of 50 mL using 1544-well plates (5 \u00b5L/well). Using microarrays, 10 000 compounds can be screened in less than 100 \u00b5L without sophisticated automation. More importantly, ligands can be identified for Probing Biology with Small Molecule Microarrays (SMM) 313 proteins obtained from crude cell extract without further purification or labeling, thus enabling discoveries of unanticipated interactions. This level of miniaturization is not only important for screening but also to measure multiple enzymatic activities in parallel from complex proteomic mixtures. While the first small molecule microarrays (SMM) were reported in the early 1990s using photolithography for their preparation, it was the success of DNA microarrays that inspired the widespread exploration of SMM as a tool to probe biological events. This chapter is divided into two main sections: (i) the preparation of SMM with a discussion of microarray surfaces, in situ microarray synthesis or immobilization of existing libraries, and (ii) the screening of SMM with a discussion of ligand discovery, enzymatic activity measurement, and carbohydrate recognition as well as non-immobilized SMM for multicomponent screening and cellular assays.",

While photolithography is used on an industrial scale (Affymetrix) to pro- duce oligonucleotide microarrays with feature size from 14 to 50 \u00b5m, most SMM have been prepared using a contact printing robot. In its simplest format, the robot picks up a solution from a microtiter plate by capillary action and delivers nanodroplets of solution (ca. 1 nL) on the array simply by getting into contact with the surface in a similar fashion as does an ink pen (Fig. 1) . Depending on the conditions, features ranging from 100 to 300 \u00b5m are obtained by this method. The first such robot was assembled according to a protocol published by the Brown laboratory in the mid 1990s [3] . By the end of the 1990s, such robots had become commercially available; current versions have the ability to print 10-50 microarrays containing 10 000 features in a matter of hours.",

            "text": "Most contact printing is carried out on standard 25 mm \u00d7 75 mm glass microscope slides, which can be functionalized but are otherwise chemically inert and have low intrinsic fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 2 , the silanol glass surface can be treated with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, which reacts covalently with the glass via hydrolysis/condensation resulting in aminosilanized slides (careful preparation is crucial to ensure an even surface) [4] . The amino groups can be subsequently coupled with a bifunctional linker (e.g., Fmoc-8amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid [5] , poly(ethylene glycol) diglicydyl ether [6] , or 1,8-diamine-3,6-dioxaoctane via carbonate formation [7] ) and termi- Fig. 2 Functionalization of glass slides. The silanol surface is reacted with aminopropylsilane, which is further reacted with a bifunctional linker and adequate spacers to obtain the desired functionalized surface nated with a functional group for covalent attachment of small molecules (maleimide, diazobenzylidene, N-hydroxysuccinimide, epoxide, alkyne, isocyanate, etc.). While it has been demonstrated that a small molecule-protein interaction is possible with small molecules attached directly to the glass surface [8] , it has generally been noted that higher sensitivity and better signalto-noise ratios are obtained if a PEG spacer is used [7, 9, 10] . To improve loading and homogeneity of the glass surfaces, aminosilylation followed by coupling with dendritic molecules (PAMAM) and subsequent crosslinking was explored. Optimized procedures led to a chemically activated polymer film with a tenfold increase in loading (150 fmol/mm 2 vs. 5 fmol/mm 2 for the aminosilane slides) and high resistance [11] . The polarity of the surface formed was modulated by changing crosslinking reagents, which allowed modifications of the spot size and sharpness. Alternatively, uncoated glass slides were functionalized with methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane and incubated with tetraethylenepentamine, thereby introducing multiple reactive groups per attachment point to the surface. This surface was further functionalized with acryloyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, or 1,4-butanediol diglicydyl ether to obtain acrylic, epoxy hydrophobic, and epoxy hydrophilic surfaces, respectively [12] . Aside from glass, arrays were also prepared on a gold surface, which can be used directly for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or mass spectroscopies. Generally, a self-assembled alkanethiolate monolayer was partially functionalized with a handle for subsequent derivatization such as a hydroquinone [13] , or carboxylic [14] or NHS groups [15] .",

This light-directed in situ synthesis was demonstrated to be effective for the preparation of oligopeptide and oligonucleotide microarrays [16] and was later used for the preparation of unnatural oligomers (carbamates) [17] . Larger oligonucleotide arrays were subsequently reported using a new photolabile protecting group -\u03b1-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl (MeNPoc) -allowing the synthesis to be carried out on features of 5-10 \u00b5m (10 6 sequences/cm 2 ) [18] .

The polymeric film is used to construct a pattern, which masks selected regions of the substrate from exposure to standard chemical reagents during synthesis, whereas the unprotected areas are exposed to coupling of new monomers. A microarray of 8 \u00b5m feature size was prepared with this method, raising the possibility of further optimization [19] . Alternatively, as the cost of preparing photolithographic masks is considerable, a maskless method using a digital micromirror device (digital light processor, DLP) was developed [20] . Using the DLP technique and a single photolabile reagent (MeNPoc-protected glycolic acid) a peptoid array was synthesized [21] . Shortly after, a strategy for the synthesis of spatially addressable arrays of cyclic peptides was also reported [22] . These experiments expanded the scope of light-directed synthesis of microarrays beyond specialized environments. DLP has also been applied to the preparation of oligonucleotide and peptide microarrays using building blocks with standard acid-labile protecting groups (DMT and Boc, respectively). Instead of directly removing the protecting group, light is used to generate an acid with spatial resolution resulting in deprotection of the standard Boc and DMT groups (Fig. 3b ) [23] [24] [25] . Although the microarray density is lower than in the masking methods (ca. 3000 features/cm 2 ), the technique is more flexible than classical mask photolithography.",

Libraries were prepared by adding the different reagents at each of the spots on the membrane. This SPOT-synthesis method can be carried out on cellulose and polypropylene sheets (loading: 100-10 000 nM/cm 2 or 10-100 nM/cm 2 , respectively) and requires no specialized infrastructure to obtain libraries. The mean spot size is 6 mm, which makes these arrays several orders of magnitude less dense than microarrays. However, the spots are sufficiently large that they can be excised and the molecules recovered from the membrane after cleavage [28] . For preparation of small molecule arrays, the cellulose has to be activated (epibromohydrin or tosyl chloride) to introduce a flexible diamino spacer allowing for further functionalization. In the case of polypropylene membranes, photoinduced coupling with acrylic acid or methyl acrylate prior to the spacer introduction proved to be effective. Such surfaces can be further modified with linker such as Rink or Wang linkers. Macroarrays of 1,3,5-triazines [29] , cyclic peptidomimetics [30] , 1,3,5-hydantoins [31] , natural product fragments (from sorangicin and epothilone) [32] , chalcones [33] , and \u03b1-acyl amino amides [34] have been reported, testifying to the flexibility of this method. The synthesized libraries can be screened against the biological targets directly on the support (e.g., protein binding, antibody binding, or metal binding assays) or reformatted in a microtiter plate or microarray after cleavage.",

Three molecules (biotin, digoxigenin, and a pipecolyl \u03b1-ketonamide -an FKPB ligand) conjugated to a cysteine residue were spotted and the array was then probed simultaneously with FITC-conjugated streptavidin, Cy3-conjugated DI-22 (an anti-digoxigenin Ab), and Cy5-conjugated FKPB.

Treatment of the glass surface with SOCl 2 in THF using catalytic amounts of DMF transformed silanols on the surface into chlorosilanes [8] . This chlorosilane was found to react readily with primary alcohols but rather slowly with secondary alcohols or phenols (Fig. 4b) . To validate the detection of small molecule-protein interactions, the interactions of three known ligand-protein pairs (\u03b1-ketoamide, digoxigenin, and biotin) were investigated and led to the observation that, despite the lack of linker, binding was detected. An important motivation for the development of this immobilization strategy was that it is compatible with libraries synthesized by the same group using a silyl linker. The viability of this immobilization method beyond the proof of concept has been validated with the discovery of new ligands from large libraries (> 1000 microarrayed compounds) [8, 36] . Furthermore, it could also be used to immobilize natural products, which often bear a primary hydroxyl group.",

Alternatively, direct coupling of protected glyoxalic acid to aminosilanized glass slides and its subsequent deprotection also afforded glyoxylyl-functionalized slides. This surface was shown to react selectively with peptides labeled with hydroxylamine or a terminal cysteine residue, which yielded a thiazolidine ring (Fig. 4c) . The authors noted that improved results were obtained in the spotting when the surface was prepared with a mixture containing protected glyoxalic acid and stearic acid to increase the hydrophobicity of the surface. The immobilization chemistry was validated using Cy3-labeled streptavidin to detect immobilized biotin. The possibility of using this array for functional assays was also demonstrated by treating an immobilized kinase substrate (octapeptide) with Src kinase in the presence of [\u03b3 -33 P]-ATP followed by autoradiography imaging of the phosphorylated peptide. It was further shown that arrayed peptides could be used for cell adhesion assay by means of a known ligand/cell surface receptor pair.

It was shown that the array could be washed and reused with nearly the same sensitivity of detection, which attests to the stability of the crosslinked dendritic surface. Concurrently, an alternative Staudinger ligation with a thioester was also used to immobilize peptides [42] . The authors prepared a 15-mer peptide which binds to RNase S and showed that the immobilized RNase S had nearly full activity. More recently, the Staudinger ligation was applied to site-selective covalent immobilization of proteins [43] . The azide-modified C-terminus of a protein was prepared by expressed protein ligation (EPL) in vitro. This chemoselective immobilization was validated with the microarraying of Ras, which was detected using a Cy5-labeled anti-Ras Ab.",

Careful analysis of functional group compatibility using carbohydrate ligands showed that the immobilization reaction was selective for hydrazides in the presence of thiols at pH > 5 [10] . Carbohydrate arrays were also prepared from unlabeled saccha-rides using a hydrazide surface (Fig. 4i) . The unfunctionalized carbohydrates containing a hemiacetal at the reducing end were immobilized and probed with lectins. Notably, it was found that a hydrazide surface was superior to a hydroxylamine surface due to the predominance of the acyclic product oxime generated in the latter reaction, whereas the hydrazide coupling yielded mostly the \u03b2-anomeric cyclic product.

Aside from minimizing potential problems associated with the display of ligands or substrates on a surface (non-specific interactions with the surface, high local concentration), it also allows separation of ligands that are bound to a protein from unbound ones prior to hybridization and as such offers a detection method that is not possible with covalently immobilized compounds (vide infra) [52] . A second asset of the PNA tag is that it can be used to encode libraries prepared by mix-and-split combinatorial synthesis by using a unique PNA codon for every building block in the library [53] . Upon cleavage from the solid phase, the library is obtained as a mixture in solution; however, it sorts itself into an addressable microarray upon hybridization (Fig. 5 ). This PNA-encoded strategy has been validated with the discovery of inhibitors from libraries of > 1000 compounds and the profiles of substrate specificity and enzymatic activity from complex proteomic mixtures [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Starting from a bifunctional linker with orthogonal protecting groups, a library is prepared by split and mix combinatorial syntheses where a specific PNA codon is used to encode every building block. The libraries are then cleaved from the solid phase to obtain a mixture in solution, which is converted to a SMM by hybridization to an oligonucleotide microarray [51] ",

Two approaches have been developed to address these limitations: (i) microarrays of nanodroplets, which have been used for multicomponent enzymatic assays, and (ii) microarrays of small molecules embedded in a biodegradable polymer for cell-based screens. For nanodroplet microarrays, it was found that small molecules could be deposited in a microarray format as glycerol nanodroplets (1.6 nL) by standard contact printing at a density of 400 spots/cm (similar density to contact printing) and that reagents or enzymes could be metered into each droplet using aerosol deposition without any cross-contamination amongst nanodroplets (Fig. 7) . Because of water's fast evaporation in these small volumes, multiple additions by aerosol are possible. The utility of this method was demonstrated by screening a library of 352 compounds against thrombin, chymotrypsin, and three caspases [63] . More recently, this method has been used to identify inhibitors of SARS. A potential limitation of this approach is that the assays need to be carried out in a high concentration of glycerol to reduce the evaporation rate, but it was shown that at least several therapeutically important enzymes (proteases and kinases) are functional under these conditions.",

After screening several polymers, polylactide/glycolide copolymer (PLGA) was identified as the best candidate [64] . As a proof of principle, it was shown that cytotoxic compounds indeed killed cells in the proximity of the compound spot but not beyond. It was also shown that this format was compatible with other phenotypes than cell death, using rapamycin for the inhibition of ribosomal phosphorylation. The readout was achieved by staining the cells with a specific anti-phosphoribosome Ab after they were fixed and permeabilized. This method was then used to evaluate the synergistic effect of 70 small molecule inhibitors in combination with seven different siRNA. These results demonstrated that high content cell-based assays can be performed in a highly miniaturized microarray format that does not require sophisticated automation.

Interestingly, uretupamine was found to inhibit only a subset of Ure2p's functions and as such provided the means to deconvolute Ure2p's different roles. It should be noted that the screen only required 4 \u00b5g of protein! Whole-genome transcription profiling and URE2 gene depletion experiments showed that this inhibitor modulated the glucose-sensitive genes controlled by Ure2p. This discovery not only shed new light on the multiple function of Ure2p but also demonstrated the power of SMM in providing rapid screens for the small molecule probes necessary to dissect complex biological networks. Using the same approach, but an extended microarray containing 12 396 small molecules from several different combinatorial libraries, Hap3p, a subunit of a yeast transcription factor complex involved in yeast aerobic respiration, was screened. For this purpose, Hap3p was expressed with a GST tag and visualized with a Cy5-labeled Ab against GST. Two hits were identified from the microarray and one was reconfirmed to be a good Hap3p ligand by SPR (K d 5 \u00b5M) . Interestingly, the other hit was a GST ligand. Importantly, the identified molecule was found to function in vivo using a reporter assay [69] . In a third example from the same group, a microarray containing 6336 phenols immobilized using the diazobenzylidene was screened with Cy5-labeled calmodulin. Sixteen hits were identified of which 13 were reconfirmed using SPR (K d 0.12 \u00b5M for the best compound) [39] . Together these results clearly show the power of SMM screen to discover new ligands for proteins of interest.",

Such labeling has limitations, including the need for additional steps in or prior to the assay in order to chemically or genetically encode the tag. Furthermore, proteins may need to be in a complex to be functional or properly folded. Perhaps the most important limitation of labeling is the inability to identify unanticipated (and thus unlabeled) proteins in crude cell lysates. Furthermore, it would be difficult for labeling techniques to be useful for diagnostic purposes because they are not applicable to complex mixture of proteins such as crude cell lysates. Nevertheless, they remain essential for screening SMM against target enzymes. In an alternative strategy, it was shown that PNA-encoded small molecules could be screened against crude cell lysates by using a sizeexclusion separation to remove small molecules that do not interact with a macromolecule (Fig. 10) [52] . Since all the PNA tags also bear a fluorophore, hybridization of the selected compounds to a DNA microarray reveals the hits. Following speculations that acute respiratory allergy may be accentuated by residual proteolytic activity in allergens such as dust mite feces, a 4000 compound library targeting cysteine proteases was screened against crude fecal extracts, resulting in the discovery of a potent inhibitor of Derp1 [56] . Using a phenotypic assay, this inhibitors was used to correlate the function of Derp1 and T-cell replication, the phenotype of allergy. In a more targeted approach, it was also shown that the inhibitors bound to an enzyme could also be isolated using a gel-based separation. This approach was used to iden- tify orthogonal inhibitors to the closely related cathepsins K and F. While several compounds inhibited both cathepsins, two compounds were found to be nearly ten times more potent for their respective targets [54] . Recently, it has been shown that an optimized microarray surface containing short PEG spacer could also be used to screen proteins directly from crude cell lysates using either genetically tagged proteins (GST) or specific antibodies towards untagged proteins. The ability to screen directly from crude lysates is significant as it saves substantial time and effort and may be more relevant as many proteins require a partner to remain active [5] .",

Two different detection approaches have generally been used, the first makes use of [\u03b3 -32/33 P]-ATP to label the immobilized substrate with a radioactive phosphate, which can be detected by autoradiography, phosphor imager, or silver staining [9, 13, [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . The second detection method relies on phosphospecific antibodies, which are fluorescently labeled [13, 51, 58, 76, 80] . While the fluorescent detection may be preferable as it avoids working with radioactive ATP, it has been shown that only monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed reliable results [76] . Alternatively, fluorescently labeled phosphor-chelators have been used to detect the phosphorylated peptide in an array [81] . Preliminary results have also been reported for mass spectrometry detection and surface plasmon detection (vide infra).",

Using [\u03b3 -33 P]-ATP, the authors showed that these arrays could be used to identify the preferred substrate of a given kinase, as exemplified by profiling two kinases -protein kinase A (PKA) (Fig. 11 ) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1). The same strategy was used to identify the preferred substrates of CK2, a serine/threonine kinase [76] . Rather than using specific peptide sequences of predicted phosphorylation sites from database analysis, it was also shown that the preferred substrate of Abl could be inferred from the phosphorylation of a random array of 1433 peptides using a weight matrix-nearest neighbor algorithm [77] . In an other example, this technique was used to define the substrate specificity of Dbf2 a yeast kinase which, together with its binding partner Mob1, is an important component of the mitotic exit signaling network. The Dbf2-Mob1 complex was found to preferentially phosphorylate substrates that contain an RXXS motif and it was shown that proteins containing this motif were phosphorylated in vivo. However, the relatively low degree of sequence restriction suggested that Dbf2 achieves specificity by docking its substrates at a site that is distinct from the phosphorylation site [75] . Together, these studies clearly demonstrate that peptide microarrays represent a useful tool in identifying the preferred substrate of a kinase, which can be used to predict the cellular target of a kinase or for screening and diagnostic applications.",

Using a set of PNA-encoded irreversible inhibitors to label active proteases in complex mixtures, the authors showed that they could measure the difference in activity of caspase-3 between apoptotic and healthy cells [52] . Concurrently, it was shown that immobilized coumarin-based fluorogenic substrates (Fig. 12) could be used to define substrate specificity of proteases, as exemplified with thrombin. Importantly, it was shown that the relative K cat /K m was comparable for solution substrates and immobilized substrates [83] . It was later shown that PNA-encoding could also be used to prepare fluorogenic substrate libraries. Aside from defining the substrate specificity of a given protease, the method was shown to be robust enough to be used with more complex mixtures such as crude cell lysates or clinical blood samples. It was Fig. 12 Profiling substrate selectivity of protease using fluorogenic substrates also sufficiently sensitive to measure differences in proteolytic activity between apoptotic and healthy cells as well as between sera from patient on anticoagulation therapy and healthy patients [55] . Conversely, it was also shown in a proof of principle that the activity of pepsin could be detected from a PNA-encoded library of substrates using dabcyl as an internal quencher and fluorescein [58] . More recently, PNA-encoded substrate containing fluorescent probes was used to perform \u03b2-secretase assay, a protease involved in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the gain in miniaturization, the authors reported that this assay format was ten times more sensitive than assays in solution [57] .",

Revealing the product of the reaction with specific lectins showed that only GlcNAc was converted suggesting that this method should be more broadly applicable.",

            "text": "The glycobiology community was quick to recognize the potential of microarray technologies to screen glycan interactions. Microarrays are particularly well suited for this purpose as complex glycans are difficult to obtain in large quantities and the presentation of glycans on a surface with controlled density mimics the natural display of carbohydrates on the surface of proteins or phospholipid bilayers. This \"cluster\" effect may also be important to yield strong multivalent interactions, which have been shown to be important for affinity and selectivity in natural systems. Oligosaccharides have been immobilized using maleimide-thiol chemistry [86] [87] [88] , Diels-Alder reaction [89] , the reaction of p-aminophenyl glycosides with cyanuric chloridecoated slides [90] , Huisgen cycloaddition [45, 46, 48, 59, 60] , Staudinger lig-ation [91] , amine-NHS chemistry [92] , and hydroxylamine-aldehyde [93] . Several reviews have already appeared highlighting the first proofs of principle in preparing and screening carbohydrate microarrays [10, 47, 94] . Notable applications of carbohydrate arrays have been to profile the specificity of therapeutically relevant antibodies against a panel of oligosaccharide. Wong and coworkers used a panel of epitopes to dissect the specificity of 2G12, a human antibody that neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 strains and is known to recognize mannose-rich carbohydrate (Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ) present on gp120. The profile revealed that the carbohydrate specificity of 2G12 is less restrictive than originally believed and that in a multivalent display, a single Man\u03b11-2Man is sufficient for strong binding [46] . In a similar study, Wong and coworkers profiled the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to Globo H, a hexasaccharide antigen found on the surface of several cancer cell lines [48] . For this purpose they prepared a microarray with seven oligosaccharides (the Globo H hexamer and truncated forms) at 15 different concentrations. It was found that in a multivalent format, the truncated tetrasaccharide had similar activity to the Globo H hexasaccharide, suggesting that the more accessible tetrasaccharide should also be effective for vaccine preparation. Carbohydrate and glycoprotein microarrays have also proven useful to study carbohydrate-protein interactions beyond the known model systems. Seeberger and coworkers used an array of seven carbohydrates and five glycoproteins to define the interactions of gp120 and its glycans with five different binding proteins (CD4, CVN, Scytovirin, 2G12, and SC-SIGN) [88] . Aside from CD4-gp120, all other interactions required the glycan. However, the promiscuity of binding varied greatly amongst the four proteins, with Scytovirin being the most specific for the exact glycan structure present on gp120. More recently, Seeberger and colleagues used an array of six carbohydrates of varying length and sulfation pattern spotted at 12 different concentrations to probe interactions between these heparinlike glycans and fibroblast growth factors (FG1 and 2) [92] . This analysis led to the identification of a monosaccharide ligand bearing a sulfation pattern not found in nature that had similar affinity to tetra-and hexasaccharides. In another study on the sulfation pattern of chondroitin, a glycosamine glycan, Hsieh-Wilson and coworkers discovered a novel and specific interaction between chondroitin sulfate and TNF-\u03b1 that can inhibit its activity [93] . In the most extensive study of lectin interactions, an array of 69 carbohydrates and glycoproteins were probed with 24 lectins at varying concentrations. This extensive study led to the identification of several unexpected lectin interactions and in a larger context clearly demonstrated the potential throughput of carbohydrate microarrays [95] .",

The screen led to the identification of a dipeptide aldehyde with an IC 50 of 2.5 nM for cathepsin L.

The screen led to the identification of four hits where a compound had reduced effect in the presence of an siRNA. These compounds were retested in conventional cytotoxic assays, which confirmed that macbecin II had reduced cytotoxicity when TSC2 was knocked down, suggesting that enhanced cellular growth resulting from decreased TSC2 activity can reduce a cell's sensitivity to DNA damage.

As discussed earlier, detection of phosphorylated substrates has been successfully achieved using [\u03b3 - P] ATP for the phosphorylation followed by autoradiography as there are a number of limitations with fluorescent detection of phosphorylated residues [9, 13, 77, 78] . Alternatively, Mrksich and coworkers have also shown that mass spectrometry (MALDI) can be used to quantify phosphorylation of substrates microarrayed on gold surfaces [82] as well as small molecule-protein and proteinprotein interactions [97] . Becker and coworkers have shown that MALDI is also suitable to detect protein-protein interactions for protein microarrays prepared by self-assembly of DNA-tagged proteins onto a DNA microarray [98] . Although the throughput of MALDI is much lower than fluorescence, it provides a means to identify the protein and as such may lead to discovery of unanticipated interactions. Alternatively, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been used to detect phosphorylated peptides. As the difference between a peptide and the phosphopeptide is not sufficient to produce a change in SPR, an antiphosphotyrosine [13] and a novel zinc-based phosphochelator group coupled to biotin/streptavidin [99] were used to produce a shift in SPR. In a proof of concept, it was also shown that SPR could be used to detect interaction between small molecules immobilized via photocrosslinking (vide supra) and proteins or antibodies [100] .",

The efficiency of SMM to screen and discover new ligands has been demonstrated with several landmark studies providing new ligands to explore important biological problems. The applicability of SMM to profile or to measure enzymatic activity from complex proteomic mixtures has also been demonstrated beyond simple proof of principle for kinases and proteases. In the carbohydrate field, the cluster effect of microarrays appears to be beneficial and carbohydrate arrays have also led to important new discoveries regarding therapeutically important antibodies, lectin specificity, and carbohydrate sulfation pattern. While the use of SMM is more challenging to implement than oligonucleotide microarrays, based on early success, there is little doubt that this format will become more widespread and will find applications in diagnostics.",
