A total of 95% of the RNA/RT-PCR control Ct values followed a normal distribution over a very small range of Ct values (2\u20133 cycles). Samples with poor RNA isolation/RT-PCR amplification efficiencies (high Ct values) were selected and excluded from the analysis as outliers of the bench protocol (21 samples), since they could heavily bias the clustering procedure. In the second step, we normalized virus-specific Ct values against the EPC (defined as the extraction and PCR controls minus the virus positive control), using the equation \u0394Ct = Cttarget \u2212 CtEPC, thus defining the change in Ct and allowing comparison of the same viral sequences between different samples. Samples with low \u0394Ct values represent PCR analyses with a high genomic load for the specific target viral sequence, and those with high \u0394Ct values represent a low genomic load for the specific target viral sequence. Because the Ct values represent very different actual numbers of microbes for the different virus types, semiquantitative categorization into tertiles or quartiles is common [28]. However, because the different viruses may show a variety of Ct patterns, researcher-driven categorization may be arbitrary and introduce cutoffs that do not harmonize with the natural distribution of viral concentrations. We therefore chose a data-driven approach that used cluster analyses to improve the classification of viral genomic load.",

Interestingly, the Finnish study with a high rate of detection of at least 1 virus reported only 15% of children with >1 virus [34], whereas in the same multicenter study, which also included 16 US study sites, RSV was detected in 67% of 2615 children <2 years of age with severe bronchiolitis, with additional viruses detected in 31% [28]. Further, approximately half of the prematurely born infants aged <6 months of age in Brazil with lower respiratory tract infection and 1 virus identified had coinfection, most commonly with RSV and HRV [35]. Similar to Brand et al [3], but in contrast to Marguet et al [19], we found that infants with RSV monoinfection were significantly younger than infants with coinfection. However, unlike Marguet et al [19], we found that infants with HRV monoinfection were significantly older than infants with all other detected viruses except bocavirus. These apparent discrepancies may be related to study design, as the mean age was lower (2.4 months), and infants with previous wheeze were excluded in the latter study [19].",

Identification of viruses does not necessarily indicate a causal association with bronchiolitis, as suggested by the present study. However, the very high rate of RSV infection, the very low rates of monoinfections with viruses other than RSV, and the lack of an association between HRV (A/B or C) or multiple viruses detected and disease severity support the dominating role of RSV in acute bronchiolitis, which is further supported by the association between high concentrations of RSV and disease severity. Although similar rates of HRV detection in young children have been found regardless of the presence of a symptomatic airway infection, as Yoshida et al recently showed in a comparison of hospitalized patients (mean age, 1.5 years) that found HRV in 35% of controls versus 29% of patients and RSV in 3% of controls versus 39% of patients [4], the role of HRV C has been unclear. Bizzintino et al found an association between HRV C and severity of acute asthma [23] in children >2 years of age, while Cox et al [45] found an increased number of hospital admissions among 197 children aged <5 years (mean age, 31.0 months).
