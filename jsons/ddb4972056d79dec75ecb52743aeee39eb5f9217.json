Much less attention has been directed to the therapy for those already infected.",

From a statistical point of view this vulnerability would make it more apparent if a particular therapeutic measure was effective in reducing the case fatality rate among them. The higher case fatality rate means that a given relative risk reduction in that baseline rate represents a relatively large absolute risk reduction, and so a relatively low number needed to treat [NNT] in order to prevent a fatality.",
