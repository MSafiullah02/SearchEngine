Thus, the investigation of online social network services is of paramount importance. In this paper, we use the sentiment analysis, which detects attitudes and emotions toward issues of society posted in social media, to understand the actual economic situation. To this end, two steps are suggested. In the first step, after training the sentiment classifiers with several big data sources of social media datasets, we consider three types of feature sets: feature vector, sequence vector and a combination of dictionary-based feature and sequence vectors. Then, the performance of six classifiers is assessed: MaxEnt-L1, C4.5 decision tree, SVM-kernel, Ada-boost, Na\u00efve Bayes and MaxEnt. In the second step, we collect datasets that are relevant to several economic words that the public use to explicitly express their opinions. Finally, we use a vector autoregression analysis to confirm our hypothesis. The results show the statistically significant relationship between public sentiment and economic performance. That is, \"depression\" and \"unemployment\" lead to KOSPI. Also, it shows that the extracted keywords from the sentiment analysis, such as \"price,\" \"year-end-tax\" and \"budget deficit,\" cause the exchange rates.",

According to the reports by Pew Research Center [1] and Statistica [2] , the number of social media users has been doubled since 2010 and is expected to increase from 0.97 billion users in 2010 to 2.95 billion users in 2020. Furthermore, the amount of data produced is expected to reach 44 zettabytes in 2020 [3] . The analytics using big data, which is collected from online social media, provides useful insights into practical applications [4] . Particularly, the opinions of the public toward a particular issue using social networking sites have a certain effect on our society. The sentiment analysis enables one to capture these emotions by identifying subjective contents as positive, neutral and negative emotions to certain social issues. Hence, the algorithm is frequently used in numerous areas such as financial market and marketing for sales forecasting. Zhang et al. [5] demonstrate that the social media sentiment provides statistically significant information about the stock price.",

For this goal, we train sentiment classifiers with big data sources collected from various social media sites including news articles, twitter and blogs. Then, we consider three different feature sets, which include feature vector and sequence vector with positive and negative word dictionaries, emoticons and lexical properties of the sequence of words. Finally, we evaluate the performance of six classifiers: MaxEnt-L1, C4.5 decision tree, SVM-kernel, Ada-boost, Na\u00efve Bayes and maximum entropy. The results show that MaxEnt-L1 has sustainably better performance than other classifiers. The next step is to predict the sentiments of the collected datasets with the trained classifiers and compare the sentiment scores with an economic index. Finally, we use a VAR analysis and Granger causality theory to investigate the causal relationship between the sentiment scores and the economic performance. The contribution of this paper is not to propose a new method but to deeply analyze the correlation between the economic value and the time series emotion value of the social data collected using specific keywords. The remainder of the paper consists of related works, methodology, economic results and conclusion.",

As a topic of natural language processing (NLP) in the field of computer science, sentiment analysis has been studied in academic fields and industry. The primary purpose of applying sentiment analysis is to figure out how people feel about something. Furthermore, many companies, which have collected a lot of data on their customers and staffs, tend to use sentiment analyses to realize the reputation of their companies and make their business plan [7] . During the 2000s, sentiment analysis was developed in various areas. Pang and Lee [8] studied diverse theories and methodologies to approach sentiment analysis. Liu [9] mentioned that the major reason for the increase in sentiment analysis studies is the proliferation of social media. As noted in [8] , advanced sentiment analysis methodology and applications are required to better understand customers.",

            "text": "Several works specifically proposed classifiers for sentiment analysis. According to [7] , SA based on supervised learning is the most well-accepted approach for sentiment analysis. The common types of classifiers are Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, neural network, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and maximum entropy. Pang et al. [10] analyzed the performance of three classifiers (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and SVM) on movie reviews with rating indicators, i.e., a number of stars, which served as a baseline. They also used star ratings as polarity signals in their training datasets. Nasukawa and Yi [6] and Wilson et al. [11] classified the contextual polarity of sentiment expressions. Particularly, [11] classified expressions about specific items using manually devised patterns to categorize the polarity. O'Hare et al. [12] reported that Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes better performed than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) on finance-related blogs. In their study, the classification on sentiments is for both ternary (i.e., positive, negative and neutral) and binary (i.e., positive and negative). In classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages, [13] concluded that machine learning algorithms such as Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and maximum entropy achieved a high accuracy (more than 80%) using the trained Twitter message with emoticons. They applied feature extractors that consisted of unigrams, bigrams, unigrams and bigrams, and unigrams with part of speech tags. However, sentiment classification is often perceived as having the domain-dependent problem because there are different sentiment expressions in different domains, and the same word can mean different sentiments. Therefore, [14] suggested a collaborative multi-domain sentiment classification approach to simultaneously train sentiment classifiers for multiple domains. Specifically, they disassembled the sentiment classifiers as a global one and a domain-specific one. Fern\u00e1ndez et al. [15] proposed the Distributional Correspondence Indexing (DCI) method for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. The experiment of [15] shows that the DCI performs well in comparison with the latest technologies for cross-language and cross-domain sentiment classifications. In addition, DCI substantially reduces the computational cost and requires less human intervention. Also, [16] creates a sentiment-related index (SRI) to evaluate the association between different lexical elements in a specific domain with the help of domain-independent features as a bridge in order to reconcile the gap between different domains. Then, they suggest a new SRI-based cross-domain sentiment classification algorithm called SentiRelated, to analyze the sentiment polarity of short texts. Furthermore, [17] explains innovative approach to predicting the sentiment 1 3",

Many companies recently used social media data such as Facebook and Twitter more frequently to interact with customers. Culnan et al. [19] introduced the Fortune 500's use of four of the most popular social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, blogs and client-hosted forums. They showed case studies of three Fortune 100 corporations to demonstrate how they administered their respective networks of social media. Generally, most activities using social media are sales, customer care, advertising, marketing, product development and innovation [20] . He et al. [21] conducted an in-depth case study, which used text mining, to analyze the instruction text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's pizza and Papa John's Pizza. Yu et al. [22] examined the effect of social media and traditional media, their relative importance and correlations to short-term firm stock market performance. They exercised advanced sentiment analysis techniques beyond the number of mentions to analyze the overall sentiment of each media resource on a daily basis toward a particular company. Figure 1 shows an overview of this study. As shown, the process can be divided into two parts. The first part trains the sentiment classifiers and calculates the performance of their sentiment classification for six types of classifiers. The second part finds which economic indicators precede or follow with the sentiment score from each source of contents. After checking the rejected hypothesis at an alpha value of some variables, we ascertain whether there is an antecedent or an aftertaste among the variables. Then, a vector autoregressive analysis is used to find the time difference that the two variables show before and after. Therefore, the Granger causality test and vector autoregressive analysis were simultaneously performed in this study.",

Lemmatization is a technique to group multiple forms of a single word into a single form. Stop word removal is the process of eliminating meaningless words such as articles, postpositions, prepositions and conjunctions. Morpheme analysis is the representation of the contents of words, phrases and paragraphs in the document as data that can be processed. It is possible to grasp the parts of the sentence morphemes and ultimately to understand the structure of sentences.

Therefore, we apply six types of machine learningbased classification algorithms for evaluation: MaxEnt-L1, decision tree, SVMkernel, Ada-boost, Na\u00efve Bayes, and MaxEnt. MaxEnt, which is Max Entropy, is a probabilistic classifier and a type of exponential model that finds the probability distribution of maximum entropy [23] . MaxEnt is based on the principle of maximum entropy and can be applied to language detection, topic classification and sentiment analysis. Because we contribute to the performance of MaxEnt, we use MaxEnt-L1. According to [24] , the MaxEnt model is a one-to-one relationship between subsets of variables that emerge from the parameterized factors of the model and subsets of variables to use in constraints. MaxEnt-L1, which adapts generalized expectation criteria for semi-supervised learning, has the flexibility to break out the one-to-one relationship because the generalized expectation criteria are defined from the model that contains generalized expectation terms. In addition, generalized expectation criteria have many advantages such as the ease of use and simplicity [25] . The generalized expectation criteria do not need to have an additional process such as making an inverted index for pre-clustering unlabeled data. In this regard, we add MaxEnt-L1 to evaluate the measures. We also use the C4.5 decision tree classifier to approximate discrete valued functions using a decision tree; the C4.5 decision tree classifier is the most popular among inductive inference algorithms [26] . As another classifier, we use Ada-boost, which is fast and simple to program [27] . In addition, Ada-boost does not require prior knowledge about the base learner, so it can be combined with any other method to find the base classifiers. We also use Na\u00efve Bayes, which is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes theorem [28] . Using training data, Na\u00efve Bayes predicts the category of documents using cue words that occur in the classified target document. Finally, we use the SVM [29] , which can find a hyperplane divided by the maximal margin in the positive and negative subsets.",

In this study, we conducted experiments using six classifiers to analyze the sentiment of the public in social media related to several economic words. We combined the machine learning method, statistical analysis and Korean economy. Then, we investigated the relation among the sentiments from three types of media (i.e., news, Twitter and blogs) and actual economic indicators such as KOSPI and exchange rates by applying Granger causality test and vector auto-regression model. We found whether the sentiment scores derived from large-scale datasets were correlated with the economic index over time. The results show that MaxEnt-L1 surpasses other classifiers that we expect. In addition, we used a VAR analysis to investigate the relationship between the sentiment of the public and the actual economic situation related to the economic theme. We confirm that the sentiment of the public shown in some economic words is actually related to the economic situation. In other words, analyzing the public sentiment can result in meaningful economic forecasts or useful information in the enterprise. In fact, a company that analyzes and uses the public sentiment through social media has a stronger effect on operations [12, 14] . Therefore, it is expected that companies will be able to see good effects if they recognize the importance of public sentiment analysis and apply it to their marketing, customer service and operation methods. In future research, we plan to show the public sensibility related to economic keywords and the effect on the actual economic situation by comparing the economic index with the more in-depth emotion of the public. In addition, the effect on the actual economic situation should be demonstrated instead of the public sensibility related to only few economic keywords by comparing the economic index with the more in-depth emotion of the public.",
