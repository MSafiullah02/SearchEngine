This pathology textbook begins with a 6-chapter general pathology section followed by 15 chapters of pathology of organ systems (systemic pathology). Although this layout parallels the instruction of pathology in many veterinary schools, the division into general pathology and systemic pathology is somewhat artificial. General pathology is the study of the reaction of cells or tissues to injury with a focus on the mechanisms of that response. In the first six chapters of this book, the response to injury is classified as cellular adaptations (degenerative, regenerative, or restorative), vascular disorders, inflammation, or neoplasia, with an additional chapter on the mechanisms of infectious diseases and one on disorders of immunity. These categorizations simplify the teaching and learning of general pathology. However, in the living body, cell injury provokes a variety of vascular, inflammatory, and immune-mediated responses in addition to disturbances of growth. These reactions not only extend beyond the injured cell to the organ or organismal level but also can occur simultaneously or in rapid succession. This first chapter is focused on the cellular responses to injury, not only on the degeneration that can progress to cell death but also on the adaptations of surviving cells. In subsequent general pathology chapters of Section I, more emphasis will be placed on the interaction among cells of different types, as well as the interaction of cells with their stroma, with other organ systems, and with circulating cells and molecules.",

It is not a separate discipline from general pathology, but a different approach to the study of disease, in which the principles of general pathology are applied at the level of the tissue or organ or even the entire body. As for general pathology, the learning process is simplified by categorization, so Section II of this book is arranged in chapters based on a particular organ system. Again, this subdivision is arbitrary, and the student must bear in mind that disease seldom, if ever, affects only one organ or tissue. It also helps to remember that most organs or tissues respond in a similar way to a particular type of injury, hence the value in mastering the concepts of general pathology before the organ system approach. There is no optimum arrangement of the organ system chapters, so pathology of organ systems can be taught in different sequences in different curricula.",

Although general pathology and systemic pathology are educationally useful divisions of the discipline, pathologists are seldom categorized as general pathologists or systemic pathologists but, instead, are often classified as specialists in a particular organ system. For example, a dermatopathologist specializes in skin diseases; a neuropathologist, in diseases of the nervous system. In North America, pathologists are certified as anatomic pathologists, interested especially in the morphologic changes of gross (macroscopic) pathology and histopathology (microscopic pathology of tissues), or as clinical pathologists, who work more with microscopic and biochemical evaluations of blood, urine, and other bodily fluids or with cytologic samples, in which individual cells are studied rather than the intact tissue. Although there is overlap between anatomic and clinical pathology, the focus of this book is anatomic pathology; clinical pathology is taught separately in most veterinary curricula. After certification, many anatomic pathologists specialize further in practice. Diagnostic pathologists are involved in autopsy (syn: necropsy; postmortem gross and histologic examination along with correlation of ancillary test results) and histologic examination of surgical biopsy specimens. Some diagnostic pathologists limit their practice to surgical (biopsy) pathology. Toxicologic and other experimental pathologists study the tissue, cellular, and molecular mechanisms of disease in a research setting.",

In diagnostic pathology an autopsy (syn: necropsy) may be performed to determine the cause of death in an individual or in a group of animals or to explain decreased production in a herd, flock, kennel, or cattery. In forensic pathology the purpose of an autopsy is to determine the nature of death from a legal perspective. Surgical pathology (histologic examination of surgically excised tissue specimens) not only facilitates diagnosis and prognosis for a living animal but also can be the basis for therapy. Experimental pathologists contribute from the design to the end point of an investigation with the goal of correlating morphologic changes with clinical, functional, and biochemical parameters to elucidate the mechanisms of disease.",

The word necropsy (literally, having a look at something dead) also served to distinguish the examination of a dead creature from biopsy, a look at a sample from a living animal (human or nonhuman). In the interest of one health, and in recognition that it is unnecessary to distinguish a postmortem examination of a human from that of a nonhuman animal, the word autopsy (literally, having a look with one's own eyes) has been applied to the postmortem examination of any creature. One could argue, because pathologists use microscopy in addition to their own eyes, that the word autopsy could just as well be applied to other diagnostic imaging modalities (e.g., radiography or computed tomography). However, by convention, the term has been relegated to the discipline of pathology, and the autopsy or biopsy examination generally implies a search for lesions.",

For example, the word malacia, which literally means softening, implies a lack of mineralization when applied to bones, but when applied to the brain, it means necrosis. That brings us to an important word that pathologists use a lot and that figures prominently in this chapter\u2014necrosis. It means death or, more precisely, the structural changes that follow death, not of the entire organism, but of cells within an organ or tissue.

Examples of first messenger molecules include microbial ligands (see also Chapter 4), hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotics. First messenger interactions typically involve the binding of a ligand to its transmembrane protein receptor, which activates a second messenger system (E-Fig. 1-1). Examples of second messenger molecules include Ca2+, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, and nitric oxide (NO). The second messenger initiates an intracellular signal transduction cascade that stimulates or alters a metabolic pathway.

As the proteins traverse the Golgi complex, they are processed (e.g., carbohydrate moieties added through glycosylation) and packaged into secretory vesicles to be released from the outer (trans) face of the Golgi complex into the cytosol, either for use by the cell that produced them, as in the case of lysosomal enzymes, or (more commonly) for delivery to the plasma membrane for export. Transmission electron microscopy is usually required to visualize the Golgi complex.

Ionizing and ultraviolet radiation are the most important types of radiation causing cellular injury. Ionizing radiation, with its frequencies above the ultraviolet range, ionizes atoms or molecules, which then cause direct cell membrane or organelle damage or the production of free radicals that react with other cellular components, especially DNA. Ionizing radiation injury is a localized side effect of radiation therapy for cancer. Ultraviolet (frequencies just above that of visible light) radiation injury develops from exposure of sparsely haired and lightly pigmented skin (or other minimally pigmented tissues, such as the conjunctiva) to sunlight. Ultraviolet radiation can disrupt cellular bonds with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also damages DNA, mainly through the formation of pyrimidine dimers. Electrical currents generate heat as they pass through tissues (e.g., skin, with high resistance), which can result in burns. Once the current enters the body, it is conducted through tissues of least resistance, especially the nervous system, where disruption of impulses in brainstem respiratory centers, the cardiac conduction system, or neuromuscular junctions results in indirect injury to cells and tissues.",

Since the sequencing of the genomes of domestic animals, the genetic basis has been discovered for more and more of these phenotypes and associated familial diseases. For example, a single insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) haplotype is common to toy and miniature dog breeds, but generally absent in giant breeds; a fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) retrogene is associated with chondrodysplastic conformation. Some conformational phenotypes are strongly linked to pathologic conditions (e.g., a missense mutation in bone morphogenetic protein 3 [BMP3] is linked to the extreme brachycephalic phenotype of Cavalier King Charles spaniels and Brussels griffons).

Ischemia is a local decrease in blood supply to tissue with resultant decreased delivery of oxygen (hypoxia), glucose, and other nutrients to the cell, as well as decreased removal of metabolic wastes. Because any injury to the respiratory or cardiovascular system can lead to hypoxia, it is commonly the ultimate cause of acute cell swelling. When cellular oxygen is depleted, oxidative phosphorylation stops, and the cell must switch to anaerobic metabolism (i.e., glycolysis) or die. As production of ATP declines, the resultant drop stimulates hexokinases, phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), and other enzymes of glycolysis. PFK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, another integral step in glycolysis. The end products of glycolysis are ATP and pyruvate and heat. This anaerobic generation of ATP (though less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation) contributes to short-term survival of the cell. In addition, pyruvate produced by glycolysis can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, certain specialized cells (e.g., neurons) cannot generate ATP anaerobically and therefore need a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. This dependency makes neurons one of the cells that are most susceptible to a deficiency or lack of oxygen.",

The electrolyte imbalance and influx of water expand the cytosol and swell mitochondria and the cytocavitary network.

The cytoplasmic pallor and vacuolation is the result of dispersion of organelles and dilution of cytosolic proteins by the influx of water.

The first process, haloalkylation (covalent binding of CCl3\n\u2022 to macromolecules), disrupts biochemical processes, especially triglyceride secretion into plasma, oxidative phosphorylation, and calcium transport, before any structural damage is evident. The other pathway, lipid peroxidation induced mainly by CCl3OO\u2022, is a secondary (indirect) chain reaction that takes time to develop. It is mainly responsible for the cell membrane injury of CCl4 toxicosis, but the effects of both pathways are thought to act in combination to cause cell death. Depending on the dose and duration of exposure and other factors, CCl4 toxicosis causes a variety of lesions via membrane injury, including steatosis (fatty liver), apoptosis and regeneration of hepatocytes, and hepatic necrosis with fibrosis. Hepatocellular membrane injury typically commences in centrilobular hepatocytes (see Fig. 8-15), where mixed-function oxidase activity in the sER is highest, but with higher doses of CCl4 occurs throughout the lobule, leading to massive hepatic necrosis.",

The MAC, bacterial cytolysins, and NK cells exert their effect in part by forming a pore or channel that disrupts the lipid bilayers of the plasma membrane. The MAC is assembled from terminal components of the complement pathway, which are abundant in blood. Assembly of the MAC begins with enzymatic cleavage of complement fragment 5b (C5b) from complement component 5 (C5). Complement component 6 (C6) binds a labile site on C5b to produce a stable intermediate. Subsequent binding of complement component 7 (C7) renders the MAC precursor lipophilic. With binding of the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits of complement component 8 (C8), the MAC precursor penetrates a nearby cell membrane lipid bilayer. Binding and oligomerization of complement component 9 (C9) then completes formation of the MAC, which creates a lytic pore that is part of the innate immune response to bacteria. Cluster of differentiation 59 (CD59), a glycoprotein receptor on the surface of leukocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (and overexpressed on some cancer cells), blocks penetration of cell membranes by the C5b-8 precursor and blocks incorporation of C9 into the MAC, thereby protecting host cells against cell membrane injury.",

The pathologist discovers a lesion because of its macroscopic or histologic differences from normal cells or tissue, and either recognizes that lesion or, for unfamiliar lesions, categorizes it as a degenerative change, vascular disturbance, inflammation, or disturbance of growth. Gross diagnosis, based on recognition of lesions at physical examination, surgery, or autopsy (syn: necropsy), is definitive for some conditions (e.g., bone fractures and other traumatic injuries). The skilled and experienced pathologist can even diagnose certain infectious, nutritional, or neoplastic diseases with accuracy at the macroscopic level.

Normally, lysosomal enzymes would cause proteolytic disintegration of the entire cell, but as a result of this denaturation, proteolytic disintegration of the cell is delayed. However, the degradation of nucleic acids is not hindered. Thus a cell that has undergone coagulative necrosis has the expected nuclear features of cell death by oncosis (i.e., pyknosis, karyorrhexis, or karyolysis), but the cell outlines are still visible histologically (see Fig. 1-16). Coagulative necrosis is most easily recognized in the liver, kidney, myocardium, or skeletal muscle, in which the temporary preservation of cell outlines also preserves tissue architecture so that the outlines of hepatic plates, renal tubules, or muscle bundles are visible at the light microscopic level. Neurons also undergo coagulative necrosis before disappearing by lytic necrosis.

The term for the macroscopic (gross) appearance of necrosis in the brain and spinal cord is malacia. Neurons are generally the cells most susceptible to necrosis, especially from hypoxia or ischemia, and develop (early in the process of cell death) the morphologic features of coagulative necrosis. With time, however, the glial cells also undergo necrosis and liquefaction of the neuropil begins. Initially malacia may merely result in a translucency of affected tissue, but within a few days necrotic tissue undergoes yellowing, softening, or swelling. Liquefaction progresses with arrival of macrophages (gitter cells) to phagocytize the myelin debris and other components of the necrotic tissue. Eventually the parenchymal cells are completely lysed or phagocytized, and all that remains is the vasculature with intervening spaces that are partially filled with lipid- and debris-laden gitter cells. In organs or tissues outside the CNS, liquefactive necrosis is most commonly encountered as part of pyogenic (pus-forming) bacterial infection with suppurative (neutrophil-rich) inflammation (see also Chapter 3) and is observed at the centers of abscesses or other collections of neutrophils.",

Such materials can be caustic in their own right and are also likely to deliver bacteria from the environment or oropharynx into the lung.

Although all cells in histologic sections are technically dead, the pathologist must distinguish between those that were viable and those that had already died before the tissue specimen was collected at biopsy or before the animal died in the case of postmortem examination. Antemortem cell death is recognized by the morphologic changes that follow the biochemical events of cell death and takes time (minutes to hours) to develop. Autolysis, in contrast, is the decomposition of cells that takes place after somatic death (i.e., death of the body) or after collection of a biopsy sample from a living animal. Autolysis results in morphologic changes in cells and tissues, and it is these changes that the pathologist must distinguish from those of necrosis. Ideally, autolysis is minimized by collecting tissues before (biopsy) or as close to the time of somatic death as possible and fixing them for histologic processing upon collection. This is especially important in tissues such as the intestine, in which autolysis develops within minutes because the mucosal epithelium is exposed to bacteria and digestive enzymes from the gut lumen. Autolyzed enterocytes have microscopic changes that can be mistaken for degenerative lesions, such as loss of the microvillous brush border, rounding, attenuation, and detachment from the basement membrane.

Dark neurons must be distinguished from neurons that died from ischemia or excitotoxicity (see Chapter 14). Skeletal muscle is not so quick to autolyze but retains the ability to contract after somatic death, especially when immersed in formalin, so muscle biopsy specimens must be clamped in a slightly stretched state before fixation to avoid contraction artifacts.

The DRs include Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAILR). The next step is internalization and recruitment of the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor\u2013associated death domain (TRADD), Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and caspase-8 to form the cytoplasmic DISC. Remember that RIPK1, depending on its ubiquitination status, can associate with the trimerized DR and direct the cell toward regulated necrosis (if caspases are inhibited) or toward survival via activation of NF\u03baB, and has an N-terminal death domain (DD) that links it to the apoptotic pathway through adaptor proteins such as TRADD or FADD. TRADD interacts with FADD, which in turn activates procaspase-8. Sufficient active caspase-8 then activates effector (executioner) caspase-3 and caspase-7 to execute apoptosis. Caspase-8 can also truncate Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, which translocates to mitochondria to trigger intrinsic apoptosis (see the next section). Importantly, the protein FLIP blocks the extrinsic pathway by binding procaspase-8 without activating it. If caspase-8 activity is insufficient, DR-mediated apoptosis can be augmented by mitochondria, almost always through Bcl-2 proteins, such as the proapoptotic Bak (Bcl-2 antagonist/killer) and Bax (Bcl-2\u2013associated X protein). Even cells that cannot initiate or propagate apoptotic signaling can still die, but do so via caspase-independent pathways of cell death, such as regulated necrosis.",

Cytochrome c promotes the assembly of the caspase-activating complex or apoptosome, which consists of caspase-9 plus apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1).

Hypertrophy often accompanies an increase in cell number (hyperplasia) due to cellular proliferation but as a stand-alone phenomenon is observed mainly in organs or tissues such as the heart (E-Fig. 1-13; see Chapter 10) or skeletal muscle (see Chapter 15), in which the principal cells are postmitotic and incapable of replication. When the term hypertrophy is applied at the cellular level, it denotes an increase in cell size because of an increase in size or number of organelles as distinguished from increased cell size from hydropic cell swelling (loss of volume control) or from accumulation of endogenous or exogenous substances. Cellular hypertrophy is the process by which postmitotic cells, such as cardiomyocytes or skeletal myocytes, can grow as the juvenile animal grows. It is also the physiologic response of striated muscle to increased workload such as occurs in training of race horses. Smooth muscle cells (e.g., in the tunica media of arteries) also undergo hypertrophy in response to increased workload.

Severe lipidosis can alter the specific gravity of hepatic parenchyma to the point that slices of liver float in formalin (or water).

Recall that loss of the ability to regulate cellular Ca2+ balance is a critical turning point that converts reversible to irreversible injury. Ischemia opens membrane calcium channels, leading to increased intracellular calcium concentration, which is normally sequestered in the cytosol, ER, and mitochondria, each with its own Ca2+-ATPase membrane pumps. The increased intracellular calcium concentration activates calpains, which cleave Na+/Ca2+ exchangers in mitochondrial and other cell membranes, leading to decreased efflux of Ca2+ and decreased reuptake of Ca2+ by the ER. Thus calcium overload is an expected sequel to cell death. Dystrophic calcification is most prominent in mitochondria and is first evident histologically as a basophilic stippling of the dead cell. With increasing deposition of calcium salts, the entire cell and even extracellular tissue can be calcified, resulting in more intense and widespread basophilia. Calcification is the gross lesion for which the myocardial and skeletal muscle necrosis of vitamin E or selenium deficiency in ruminants was named white muscle disease (see Fig. 1-38). Calcification is also prominent in other forms of necrosis (e.g., in the caseous necrosis of tuberculoid granulomas), in parasitic granulomas, and in necrotic fat or lipomas (benign neoplasms of adipocytes).",

Many cases, especially with the lower exposure in urban-dwelling people or animals that breathe polluted air, are not associated with clinical disease but impart a fine gray-black stippling to the lung (Fig. 1-41, A\n), visible through the visceral pleura, plus a dark gray discoloration of tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Carbon particles deposited in alveolar spaces are phagocytized by macrophages and then transported to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and on to tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Histologically, the indigestible carbon particles and other inhaled dusts appear as fine black granular material and crystalline material in macrophages in extracellular tissues adjacent to intrapulmonary airways and vasculature (see Fig. 1-41, B).

The melanocytes of animals with CHS have enlarged melanosomes, but the melanin pigment is not transferred effectively to keratinocytes, so coat color is a pastel shade of what it should have been. Normally pigmented skin and hair can also become depigmented because of an immune-mediated attack on melanocytes (vitiligo) or basilar keratinocytes (see Chapter 17).

Most somatic cells have a finite number of cell divisions that, at least in part, is determined by the length of telomeres. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide (TTA-GGG) sequences that cap the ends of linear chromosomes, providing a template for complete replication of the chromosomal DNA and preventing the chromosomal ends from being misinterpreted as double-stranded DNA breaks. Telomeric DNA is protected from inappropriate repair by associated proteins that form the shelterin complex. Telomeres are truncated (shortened) with each cell division because the DNA polymerases require a leading primer and so cannot replicate all the way to the end of the DNA molecule. In \u201cimmortal\u201d cells, such as germ cells or certain stem cells, leukocytes (e.g., activated T lymphocytes), or cancer cells, active telomerase replenishes telomeres (E-Fig. 1-19). Telomerase consists of an RNA subunit template component (TERC) and a catalytic component (TERT), which is a reverse transcriptase. Mutations of either component have been associated with aging syndromes and other disorders. Dysfunctional telomeres signal the DDR with activation of p53 and arrest of the cell cycle. Arrest of the cell cycle can be a temporary pause for DNA repair or can progress to senescence (an irreversible growth arrest) or to cell death through apoptosis. DNA repair pathways that are triggered by dysfunctional telomeres tend to result in abnormal repair (e.g., chromosomal fusions) that exacerbates the DNA damage and elicits a persistent DDR.",

In theory, an almost infinite variation in the arrangement of the bases along a polynucleotide chain is possible. The process of translation occurs on ribosomes, both free in the cytoplasm and on rER.

However, if there were a simple one-to-one correspondence between genes and proteins, then the approximately 20,000 genes in an animal should give rise to approximately 20,000 different proteins. This number seems insufficient for cell structure and function. The answer to this conundrum is found in two features of genes. First, genes can generate multiple different proteins, not just one. Second, many proteins undergo posttranslational modifications, which can include chemical changes (e.g., hydroxylation, methylation) of amino acid side chains, the addition of carbohydrate moieties (e.g., glycosylation), or proteolytic cleavage of polypeptides (e.g., the conversion of proinsulin to insulin). The polypeptide chain that is the primary translation product is also folded and bonded into a specific three-dimensional structure determined by its amino acid sequence. Two or more polypeptide chains, products of the same or different genes, may combine to form a protein complex. Thus it has been estimated that 20,000 genes can encode as many as a million different proteins. The proteome includes all the proteins of a cell (cellular proteome), tissue, or animal (complete proteome). Individual proteins in a proteome do not function in isolation. They form elaborate networks, involving many different proteins and respond in a coordinated fashion to many different genetic, developmental, or environmental signals such as those that occur in homeostasis and in cellular adaptation, injury, aging, and neoplasia.

In contrast, autosomal dominant disorders have serious effects on structural proteins, such as collagen or spectrin, even in heterozygotes with one normal allele. A 50% reduction in the amount of such proteins results in abnormal structure and assembly of collagen, and a spectrin deficiency causes osmotic fragility of erythrocytes and hereditary spherocytosis in golden retriever dogs.",

In such cases, mitochondrial mutations occur in mtDNA rather than in the nuclear genome. Diseases resulting from mitochondrial inheritance are rare, and many affect the nervous (e.g., mitochondrial encephalopathies; see Chapter 14) and muscular systems. There are only 37 mitochondrial genes, and a feature unique to mtDNA is maternal inheritance. Dams and only dams transmit mtDNA to their offspring, both male and female. Sires make no contribution of mtDNA to offspring. This peculiarity exists because ova contain numerous mitochondria within their cytoplasm, whereas spermatozoa contain few, if any.

Although, within individual cell types, some variation in ATP concentrations may be tolerated, there is typically a threshold concentration below which cells begin to degenerate and die. Thus cells with large ATP requirements tend to be the ones most seriously affected by mitochondrial diseases. Because mtDNA encodes enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, mutations affecting these genes exert their deleterious effects primarily on the organs most dependent on oxidative phosphorylation such as the CNS, skeletal muscle (type II myofibers), cardiac muscle, liver, and kidneys. For example, the CNS produces approximately 20% of the body's total ATP and therefore is most often affected by mtDNA mutations. The mutation rate of mtDNA is approximately 10 times that of nuclear DNA. This difference is caused by a relative lack of DNA repair mechanisms in mtDNA and by damage from ROS released during oxidative phosphorylation.",

Fertilization of such ova by normal spermatozoa results in two types of zygotes, trisomic (or tetrasomic) or monosomic.

In the division of the fertilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cells receiving three sex chromosomes, whereas the other receives only one, yielding, for example, an n-1, X/n+1, XXX mosaic. All cells derived from each of these cells will have the same abnormal karyotype. An example of X (sex) chromosome mosaicism occurs in tortoiseshell and calico (tricolored) cats. In all female mammalian cells, the function of one X chromosome is inactivated through a random process called X chromosome inactivation. Approximately 50% of the cells of tricolored cats have inactivated paternal X chromosomes; the other 50% have inactivated maternal X chromosomes.

Each variant gene confers a small increase in disease risk, but no single gene is necessary or able alone to produce disease. It is only when several polymorphisms are present in an animal that disease occurs, hence the terms multigenic or polygenic. Thus, unlike the single\u2013mutant gene disorders (discussed previously) that commonly cause disease and give rise to mendelian-inherited disorders, each individual polymorphism has a small effect and rarely causes disease by itself. Because environmental interactions are important in the pathogenesis of these diseases and the complex traits do not follow a mendelian pattern of inheritance, the genes and polymorphisms that contribute to these diseases have been very difficult to determine. Assigning a disease to this mode of inheritance must be done with caution. Diagnosis of diseases that are considered complex multigenic disorders such as type 1 diabetes (a known human complex multigenic disorder) depends on many factors and the exclusion of mendelian (single-gene) and chromosomal modes of transmission. The occurrence of complex multigenic disorders in animals has not been demonstrated except in laboratory animal models of human disease, but their existence in domestic animal species is highly likely.",

During their lifespan, somatic cells can divide up to 50 to 60 times. If they do not express telomerase, their telomeres are significantly shortened. A telomere is a region at the end of each chromatid that protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration and/or from fusion with adjacent \u201caged\u201d chromosomes. In the presence of active checkpoints, cells become senescent. If these checkpoints fail, DNA-repair pathways are inappropriately activated and result in the formation of dicentric chromosomes. During mitosis, dicentric chromosomes are pulled apart, leading to random double-stranded breaks in affected chromatids. In response, DNA-repair pathways are again activated, resulting in the formation of additional dicentric chromosomes. Cells that go through repetitive sequences of this \u201cbridge-fusion-breakage\u201d cycle have substantial chromosomal instability and numerous mutations. Subsequently, if affected cells fail to express telomerase, they eventually die. If they express telomerase, the cells can escape the \u201cbridge-fusion-breakage\u201d cycle. However, their survival enhances tumorigenesis because of chromosomal instability and numerous mutations.",
