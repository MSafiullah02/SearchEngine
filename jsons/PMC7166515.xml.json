            "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool to detect viruses compared with some traditional methods such as the direct fluorescent\u2010antibody assay or virus isolation in cell culture. Real\u2010time PCR is a sensitive system to detect viral genomes, used commonly worldwide [Storch, 2000]. Moreover, multiplex PCR fluorescence techniques are able to identify several genes in one tube simultaneously. Some reports have described simultaneous detection systems for up to 20 viruses using real\u2010time PCR or conventional PCR [Vet et al., 1999; Bellau\u2010Pujol et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Molenkamp et al., 2007; Nolte et al., 2007; van de Pol et al., 2007; Wada et al., 2009]. However, the number of viruses detectable in one tube is limited by fluorescence wavelength. On the other hand, microarray analysis can detect a large number of viruses simultaneously. The weak point of the microarray assay is its low sensitivity and specificity [Wang et al., 2002].",

In this system, two viruses are detected in one well using a duplex TaqMan real\u2010time reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2010PCR system; since more than 82 different duplex real\u2010time PCRs are performed in a 96\u2010well plate except wells for standard curve and internal controls, theoretically 163 human viruses can be detected in a 96\u2010well plate simultaneously. Using this system, the distribution and quantification of viruses were investigated in organ specimens from autopsies of 20 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. In addition, clinical samples from patients with uncertain diagnoses were examined to identify the causes of infection.",

Design of this system, designated as the \u201cmultivirus real\u2010time PCR,\u201d is shown in Figure 1A. Quantitect Multiplex Probe RT\u2010PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), MicroAmp Optical 96\u2010Well Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems), and MicroAmp Optical Adhesive Film (Applied Biosystems) were used as 2\u00d7 master mix, 96\u2010well plates, and adhesive film, respectively. Each well contains two probe\u2013primer sets with 6\u2010FAM\u2010 and HEX\u2010labeled probes, allowing two viruses were to be detected in each well, and the 163 viruses listed in Table I to be detected in a 96\u2010well plate simultaneously. A standard curve was established for nine wells of each plate (A1\u2013A9), which contained FAM\u2010 or HEX\u2010labeled probes and primers for green fluorescent protein and glutathione S\u2010transferase genes with control plasmids at 101 to 107 copies. Thus, an approximate copy number of each virus could be calculated based on the standard curve. To use the system routinely, 2\u00d7 probe\u2013primer mix was stored in a 96\u2010well plate at \u221220\u00b0C. For detection of viruses, DNA and RNA samples (50 ng per well) were added to 2\u00d7 master mix with (for RNA) and without (for DNA) RT. When sufficient amounts of DNA or RNA were not obtained from clinical samples, <50 ng of DNA or RNA per well were applied in this system. Ten microliters of 2\u00d7 probe\u2013primer mix and 10 \u00b5l of 2\u00d7 master mix with sample DNA (36 wells) or RNA (60 wells) were then mixed in a 96\u2010well reaction plate. Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) or an Mx3005P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The RT\u2010PCR conditions were 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Quantitative results of viruses were obtained by generating standard curves for two plasmids in the A1\u2013A9 wells. Real\u2010time PCR using a condition for RT\u2010PCR (50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min) had similar sensitivity to real\u2010time PCR using usual DNA conditions (95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min) in the detection for some DNA viruses (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In addition, the duplex real\u2010time PCR using Quantitect Multiplex Probe RT\u2010PCR kit (Qiagen) had similar sensitivity to single real\u2010time PCR procedures using Quantitect Probe RT\u2010PCR kit (Qiagen) in several probe\u2013primer sets (Supplementary Fig. 1B).",

Each probe and primer set amplified a gene fragment of target virus specifically (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table II). When using supernatants of virus\u2010infected cells, the reactions were specific. Some samples of supernatants were positive for two or three viruses, because the target virus belonged to several categories. For example, the RNA sample extracted from supernatants of H5N1 influenza virus\u2010infected cells was positive in the wells with probe and primer sets for both H5N1 influenza virus and influenza\u2010A virus. Some clinical samples, such as pathological samples and body fluids, were positive for other viruses as well as target viruses because of the presence of such viruses in the samples (Supplementary Table II and Fig. 1B, arrow (a)). Although not all positive control samples could be collected, the results confirmed the adequate specificity of each probe\u2013primer set for its target virus for virus screening. The multivirus real\u2010time PCR system also detects human internal control genes such as glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, DNA, and mRNA), beta\u2010actin (DNA), and beta\u20102\u2010microgloblin (mRNA) (Supplementary Tables I and II).

HSV\u20101 was identified in brain biopsy tissues from two patients with encephalitis. A high copy number of HHV\u20106 was detected in the serum of a patient (1.5 \u00d7 107 copies/ml in the serum). In another patient, parechovirus 3 were detected in cerebral fluids. The presence of these viruses in the samples was confirmed by individual real\u2010time PCR specific for each virus, and conventional (RT\u2010) PCR. Clinical manifestations of these four patients were compatible with the virus infections. In addition, 29 samples from patients with other diseases such as myocarditis, hepatitis, and sudden death were examined. Parvovirus B19, EBV, CMV, HHV\u20106, HHV\u20107, and TTV were detected in the samples; however, the titers of these viruses were low. In addition, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization could not detect the viruses in the samples. It was therefore concluded that these viruses were not the causes of diseases in the cases.",

Since one\u2010step real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR employs specific primers as RT primers, with targets shorter than 100 bp, this system can detect short fragments of RNA viruses specifically with high sensitivity. The sensitivity and specificity of this system are equivalent to those of standard real\u2010time PCR systems (Supplementary Fig. 1), and its sensitivity would be much higher than in microarray systems.

            "text": "There is little current information about quantification of pathogenic viruses in immunocompromised hosts. Chen and Hudnall [2006] described anatomical mapping of herpes viruses in eight autopsy cases, including two AIDS cases. The multivirus real\u2010time PCR showed that 21 of the 163 probe\u2013primer sets for virus produced positive reactions in AIDS autopsy samples. Many RNA viruses were negative in all cases. Although the low detection rate of RNA viruses might be associated with the quality of extracted RNA, these results suggest that the AIDS patients in the present study were infected with limited types of viruses. TTV and HHV\u20106 were detected frequently in AIDS autopsy samples and some clinical samples. TTV was identified from a hepatitis patient as a hepatitis\u2010associated virus [Nishizawa et al., 1997]. However, TTV, a ubiquitous virus, was shown to be present in various tissues [Okamoto, 2009]. Although TTV titers were relatively high compared with those of other viruses, broad TTV distribution suggests that it is not associated with specific diseases in immunocompromised hosts. HHV\u20106 is another ubiquitous virus with which almost 100% of adults are infected. Primary infection of HHV\u20106 causes exanthema subitum in children [Yamanishi et al., 1988]. Reactivation of HHV\u20106 may cause hepatitis, pneumonia, and encephalitis in immunocompromised hosts, such as transplant patients [Ljungman, 2002]. The average number of HHV\u20106 copies in the HHV\u20106\u2010positive samples in AIDS autopsy was 0.008 copies per cell, suggesting low numbers of HHV\u20106 copies in the organs. On the other hand, HHV\u20106 was identified as a possible cause of infection in a clinical case of encephalitis because of extremely high numbers of copies in the serum and clinical manifestations [Ogata et al., 2010]. Thus, a virus's copy number is important information to estimate its etiology. CMV was frequently detected in AIDS autopsy samples by the multivirus real\u2010time PCR system. High CMV copy numbers in the adrenal gland, pancreas and lung were associated with the occurrence of CMV\u2010associated adrenitis, pancreatitis, and pneumonia. CMV was detected frequently in the adrenal gland [Pulakhandam and Dincsoy, 1990]. The results of CMV detection in multivirus real\u2010time PCR were correlated highly with the frequency of CMV inclusion bodies on the slides, suggesting that the occurrence of CMV\u2010associated diseases is associated with virus titers of CMV in organs.",

Although none of the patients received HAART, HIV\u20101 titers always change in AIDS patients [Ho et al., 1989]; the autopsy samples might have had insufficient HIV\u20101 titers for detection by real\u2010time PCR. Also, the probe and primers used in this system might not detect the HIV\u20101 because of mutations in the target regions. Mutations in HIV\u20101 occur so frequently that it is difficult to detect HIV\u20101 using one or two probe\u2013primer sets [Desire et al., 2001; Yun et al., 2002].",
