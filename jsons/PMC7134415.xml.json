            "text": "\nPrinciples and Practise of Infectious Diseases has always been the number one book in the field, and the authors have now made maximum use of the facilities of both computers and the Internet to make the online version even more valuable. One major advantage of the computer is the ability to search the entire text. Thus, items such as \u2018rheumatoid factor\u2019 that only justify a few major references in an index come up far more frequently in a search. Then one can search for a name. Those interested in coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections, for example, can enter Archer GL and find references to 34 papers of his in the text. A second advantage of the computer is the ability to insert links into the text to allow rapid movement between pages; these are most obvious when moving to references and into the drug database. There are also facilities to \u2018bookmark\u2019 pages and make notes on topics of interest.",

            "text": "Use of the Internet means that the authors can readily provide updates to the text; 29 at the time of writing. Updates, for example on the waning activity of metronidazole on Clostridium difficile infections, are shown as paragraphs inserted into the text. Another use of the Internet is for references; many of those cited in the text (251 for C. difficile diarrhoea) can be automatically brought up from Medline, and there is an option to obtain similar articles to that quoted (e.g. clicking on the Bartlett 1992 review brings up 119 similar articles from Medline). Wider use of the Internet is discussed in the last section, which provides links to relevant (largely American) journals, websites, online textbooks and practise guidelines. The authors are clearly recommending that infectious diseases physicians should download relevant items to a personal digital assistant carried on the wards, and speculate on the arrival of voice recognition so the doctor can ask an immediate question. The possible future arrival of a microchip that can be embedded into the patient containing the medical history is awaited with interest.",

This can be used as a standalone database (which includes many drugs not relevant to infection, such as \u03b2-blockers and antidiabetics). However, the direct links given when a drug is mentioned in the PPID text will be the most useful. For example, when erythromycin is recommended for mycoplasma infections, it appears as a hyperlink. Click on the name and you are provided with a monograph on the drug. The monograph starts with the international trade names (around 90 in all); interestingly enough, eros in Indonesia. It includes pharmacology, warnings, drug interactions, use, adverse reactions etc. The last section gives comparative costs (in US$) of different formulations.",

New sections include one entitled \u2018Biodefence\u2019, in which the recent anthrax attacks are fully discussed. Emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome are also reviewed. Even topics that may have been thought to have been fully covered have been updated. Thus the section on fusidic acid, while it is clearly based on previous editions, is nonetheless updated to consider activity against current problem microbes such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The \u2018molecular biology approach\u2019 is gaining ground; for example, the chapter previously entitled \u2018Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacteria\u2019 is now called \u2018Molecular mechanisms\u2026\u2019.",

The indexing facility is most helpful; looking up, say, \u2018fusidic acid\u2019 is quicker than finding it in the printed index. However, PPIDonline clearly requires up-to-date computers and broadband access. The data on the printed page for fusidic acid covers two pages. In PPID online, each section heading requires a new page, even if the section is only six lines long. Thus fusidic acid requires seven page downloads, which can cause a degree of frustration. The best of both worlds, therefore, would be to have both the book (which would allow better browsing) and the online version. What is more, while the book will remain on the shelf (even if dated), online access is likely to cease when the next edition appears!",
