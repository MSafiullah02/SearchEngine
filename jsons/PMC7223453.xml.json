Due to both individual and social barriers, TGW often do not have easy access to appropriate screening for HIV infection [3, 4] even though the HIV epidemic among TGW is now recognized as a major global public health problem [2, 4, 5]. Previous studies found that HIV prevalence were 27.3% among TGW who are sex workers compared to 14.7% for those who do not engage in sex work [2]. This means that more than one of five TGW might be living with HIV. Additional studies reported that TGW had 48 times the risk of being HIV infected compared to all reproductive age adults [2].",

The risk of HIV transmission related to engaging in receptive anal intercourse without condoms or medications was 13 times higher than vaginal intercourse [7]. The high prevalence of substance use among TGW has been reported in various studies [4, 8] as a contributing factor for HIV. The survey conducted in San Francisco revealed that 58% of TGW used alcohol and 43.3% used substances (marijuana, methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and \u201cclub drugs\u201d) [9]. Additionally, the high prevalence of commercial sex work within the TGW community was detected in previous findings ranging from 24 to 75% [2, 10, 11].",

The increase in the number of TGW has been reported recently as being due to socio-cultural integration. However, LGBT people are still stigmatized and exposed to various forms of discrimination and social isolation [13]. Our review of the literature found very few studies focusing on TGW that discussed the issue of HIV prevalence and related factors in Vietnam. There was only one study using a snowball sample targeted on TGW in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016 [13]. In this study, we applied a method of collecting and analyzing chain-referral data, respondent-driven sampling (RDS), which is expected to overcome the limitations of convenience sampling and generates unbiased population estimates within hidden or hard-to-reach populations [14, 15].",

Each of six CBO leaders, who have the large network size and understand the context of the TGW community the most, were asked to list 10 potential seeds in order of priority. From these lists, ten seeds were selected based on the highest vote.

Various organizations led by TGW and other sexual minorities have been reaching TGW with HIV and STI prevention information and referral to diagnosis and treatment services [23]. Thanks to recent progress in HIV/AIDS prevention and control in Vietnam, there was a two-thirds reduction in HIV prevalence in the population over the 10-year period from 2007 to 2017 [24, 25], which might be linked to the lower prevalence in TGW.",

These tests were provided at the CBO which was most convenient for participants. The importance of CBO in screening, detecting new cases of HIV infection in the community as well as in referring TWG to the health care and prevention services has been promotedby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5]. Since 2016, PEPFAR through USAID has piloted community-based HIV testing (lay-test) in Vietnam [23]. Under the program, CBOs in HCMC have been trained and started conducting lay-test at their offices. The introduction of community-based HIV testing has increased the number of vulnerable and high risk-taking groups such as TGW to know their HIV status [23], which is the first of the three major HIV-controls 90% tested, \u201390% on ARV and \u201390% having viral load suppression. The Government of Vietnam has committed to these targets [26]. Furthermore, prevention methods, such as condom use and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) medication are also potential to reduce the high HIV prevalence among TGW. In literature, there are many studies have indicated the crucial role of condom use and PrEP in protecting against HIV infection in TGW population [27\u201329]. Therefore, CBOs should be provided with resources to expand their reach and services to TGW population, not only in HIV screening but also in community mobilization, coordinated referral networks, and prevention services, such as condom or PrEP medication distribution.",

The HIV rate among transgender women using poppers was twice as high compared with those who did not use poppers. Popper use has been well documented in previous studies as a predictor of HIV infection [30, 31]. There might be two explanationsfor this result. Firstly, TGW who engage in receptive anal intercourse might use poppers to increase dilation of the anal sphincter, reducing possible discomfort during anal intercourse. Furthermore, some previous studies showed that the receptive role in the anal intercourse was associated with decreased condom use, since those who took the insertive position had more autonomy of determining condom use [32]. Secondly, like other club drugs, poppers also had the pharmacological and neurological effects on sexual behaviors, such as promoting sexual desire, reducing sexual inhibition, modifying mental states, and decreasing physical experiences of pain [33, 34]. This might further increase risks of HIV transmission during sexual intercourse since these effects of poppers can prevent users from using condoms and lead to group sex behaviors [34, 35].",

Accessing health care services by TGW is still limited, especially for HIV prevention and care interventions. Therefore, reaching out to such a hard-to-reach population plays a key role in the success of an intervention program. In this study, the RDS approach was shown to be effective in reaching the TGW community and in detecting new HIV cases, with 19 new cases out of 456 participants. The RDS is also considered as a relatively simple and low-cost way. Therefore, HIV intervention programs can be tailored based on such peer network approach to expand their reach to TGW as well as other members of the LGBT community.",
