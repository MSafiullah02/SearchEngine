This is the expectation that exposure to threat makes people abandon social niceties and, being naturally rivals, fall back into \u2018brutishness and misery\u2019. Major newspapers report panic, with people running to shops to collect masks, hand sanitizers and food. Those behaviours are routinely qualified as irrational: why rush to buy food when we are told that there will be no shortages? We do not doubt that humans can be irrational (we misevaluate large magnitudes; underestimate risks and value short-term gain [7]). At the individual level, however, it is rational to hoard food and toilet paper when we are told that we will have to stay at home for an indefinite amount of time. It\u2019s not that we do not trust politicians, but we are right to be uncertain about the resilience of institutions, and the social contract in general, in the face of an unprecedented, unknown, and growing threat. Similarly, it is perfectly rational, at the individual level, to run for the exits when the building is on fire. However, these self-oriented rational decisions are the ones on which we have to consciously reflect [8]. Our initial, intuitive responses are, on the contrary, to be cooperative [9].",

Humans, like other primates, stay close to significant others to create and maintain social bonds [13,14]. Contact-seeking may be a \u2018natural\u2019 drive which is embedded in our physiology. Social touch contributes to the physiological regulation of the body\u2019s responses to acute stressors and other short-term challenges. Close social support is not an extra for getting additional rewards. It constitutes our baseline [15]. Our brains do not respond positively to its presence, but negatively to its loss. People can crave for social cues just like they crave for food [16]. The policy implications of decades of research in social neuroscience are clear, but widely ignored: asking people to renounce social contact is not just asking them to abstain from pleasurable activities; it is asking them to diverge from a point of equilibrium, toward which they normally all gravitate.",

Rather than \u2018falling back\u2019 into selfish isolation, as in the Hobbesian picture, people who feel afraid, stressed, and threatened will not just seek social contact: they seek even more social contact [4,11]. Research on disasters has shown that contact-seeking rather than distancing is the primary response to perceived danger, even if the latter is safer [3]. When we know there is something to lose, rather than to win, we are more prone to join others, both to diffuse stress and to reduce our feelings of responsibility [6]. Affiliative tendencies and contact-seeking would preferentially target individuals who are already familiar [3]. In their absence, people look for familiar places associated with close ones [3]. It is this, perhaps, that explains mass movements before confinement rules are proclaimed. It is also possible that ad hoc groups emerge from scratch when threat arises, emerging from a feeling of \u2018common fate\u2019 [2]. Exodus away from dense city centers has occurred in several countries and has been criticized for its potentially disastrous epidemiological consequences.",

We humans also are equipped with mechanisms (for example, the feeling of disgust) to avoid possible contaminants and prevent us from being infected [22,23]. Many studies, from sensory to more abstract cases of disgust, suggest that this mechanism is very conservative. One instance of food poisoning generates long-lasting aversive responses to the same food, as well as similar ones [24,25]. Even knowing that the shirt worn by a sex-offender has been washed multiple times, or that a cockroach plunged in a glass in a perfectly sterile way, will suffice to make us refuse to use or consume these goods [26]. So why don\u2019t we avoid each other in times of infections? It is because our infection-avoidance mechanisms are overwhelmed by a much stronger drive to affiliate and seek close contact.",

We are in the midst of a massive \u2018real life experiment\u2019 exploring whether our brains, and bodies, can do without physical proximity (see [27] for a preliminary answer).
