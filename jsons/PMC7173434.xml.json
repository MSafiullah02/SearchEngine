An infection may or may not cause illness of the patient. Infection that does not cause illness is called subclinical. Diseases cause symptoms, clinical manifestations that the patient describes such as pain, nausea, loss of appetite, or fatigue, and signs, objective observations such as fever, rash, paralysis, seizure, coma, or rapid breathing. The duration of infection may be acute (days or weeks) or chronic (months or years). If the pathogen is not cleared by the immune response, the infection is described as persistent. If an infectious agent persists without replicating, the infection is called latent. A latent infection can reactivate; the agent can replicate and cause illness if the immune system fails to keep it under control.",

Aerosols can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods and inhaled deeply into the lungs, reaching the alveoli. Particles larger than 5 \u03bcm in diameter lodge in the nasopharynx, trachea, and bronchi. Infected nasal and respiratory secretions are frequently spread by hand-to-hand contact or hand-to-fomite (such as a doorknob) contact followed by transfer of the infected secretions from contaminated hand to the nose or conjunctival mucosa. Thus are the rhinoviruses that cause common colds and influenza viruses often transmitted. Aerosol particles inhaled into the alveoli initiate infection in the lung (e.g., tuberculosis).",

            "text": "Many infectious agents have a tropism to infect a particular organ or portal of entry that leads to a particular organ. The organ or cell type that a pathogen infects is a major determinant of the clinical manifestations. Infection of the lungs frequently follows a pulmonary portal of entry and leads to pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae). However, other serious pulmonary infections arrive in the lung through the bloodstream (e.g., secondary pneumonic plague). Often, pathogens are named by their characteristic target organ such as Japanese encephalitis virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Neisseria meningitidis that often infect the brain and leptomeninges. Myocarditis is frequently caused by coxsackie B viruses, Trypanosoma cruzi, and C. diphtheriae toxin. Infections of the urinary tract also reflect the urethral portal of entry and ascending spread of enteric bacteria that contaminate the urethral meatus. Sexually transmitted pathogens (e.g., Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, and herpes simplex virus, type II) have evolved to adapt to the female and male genital tracts and to survive by transmission to new hosts. Enteric pathogens take advantage of poverty, poor hygiene, and failure to separate human fecal deposition from water supplies to maintain populations of persons continuously transmitting Entamoeba histolytica, Vibrio cholerae, S. typhi, enteroviruses, and pathogenic strains of E. coli. Tropism for the liver and inflammatory hepatic damage is characteristic of numerous viruses including yellow fever virus and hepatitis viruses A, B, C, delta, and E. Rickettsia target endothelial cells throughout the body; mononuclear phagocytes are host cells for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Francisella tularensis, Coxiella burnetii, and Brucella, and some obligately intracellular organisms such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii are even adapted to survive and replicate specifically in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. For some infections, microbial surface proteins called adhesins and host receptors for the adhesins have been identified to mediate the observed cellular and tissue tropism by determining which cell types are infected or to which body surface cells the organisms gain a firm foothold.",
