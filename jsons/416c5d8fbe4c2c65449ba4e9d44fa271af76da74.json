Lower dose empiric anticoagulation may be utilized as clinically 12 appropriate in the intubated critically ill patients due to the bleeding risk associated with 13 hemorrhagic pneumonitis with higher Xa levels. For the patient at high risk of bleeding (Table   14 IV), the clinician could consider obtaining a CT PE study, if this would alter management. If a 15 CT PE is unable to be obtained, lower extremity duplex ultrasonography would be an alternative 16 option, recognizing limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Prior to obtaining imaging, 17 clinicians should screen each patient to ensure that testing will not be futile nor redundant (Table   18   V) . 19 If the diagnostic study is negative, thromboprophylaxis is recommended. If the study is positive, 20 consideration should be given to full dose anticoagulation in the non-intubated admitted patient 21 and lower dose empiric anticoagulation (either clinician run non-nomogram; or using the ACS 22 nomogram without bolus, Figures 1 and 2) in the intubated critically ill patients due to the bleeding risk, or full dose anticoagulation if felt to be appropriate by the intensivist. The existing Michigan Medicine faculty practice guidelines recommend utilization of Wells' 20 score to determine pretest probability of a DVT (Table VI) . 12 We recommend use of this score (Figures 3 and 4) . In the 19 high bleeding risk patient (VTE-BLEED score >2), a lower extremity DVT scan may be 20 indicated if the patients meets criteria (Table V) . We note that the VTE-BLEED score (Table   21 IV) is validated in the outpatient population, and that no similar score exists for use in the 22 acutely hospitalized nor critically ill population. This specific patient cohort may have additional risk factors that increase bleeding risk such as thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis and other anti-1 thrombotic use that should be taken into consideration by the clinician at the bedside.

Just a few short months ago, it was 7 inconceivable that hospitals across the United States and the globe would be stretched far beyond 8 capacity, that essential resources would be rationed, and that even the most mundane, everyday 9 clinical diagnosis and treatment algorithms would be altered.

All patients with COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 should be treated with thromboprophylaxis. This statement places value on avoiding the need to reassess VTE risk when a patient has a change in status, and accepts overall low bleeding risk associated with use of anticoagulants used at thromboprophylactic doses. 2. Elevated D-dimer is expected with severe COVID infection and should not be a determinant in the decision to obtain imaging. Negative D-dimer in combination with a low clinical risk score can still safely exclude VTE and may have limited utility for this purpose. 3. Current guidelines recommend empiric treatment of suspected PE if imaging is expected to take > 4 hours, or for DVT if imaging is expected to take > 24 hours. We expect that due to stress on the healthcare system that imaging may be delayed for up to a month or greater, but that patients may be safely empirically treated during this time by determining risk-benefit ratio. 4. Duplex ultrasonography should be utilized when the three following conditions are met simultaneously: (1) bleeding risk is high, (2) the results will change management (3) clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism is high and CT PE is unobtainable or clinical suspicion of DVT is high (based upon modified Wells and Wells scoring systems). 5. Most patients with confirmed or suspected VTE who are not at high bleeding risk should receive therapeutic doses of anticoagulation. 6. In patients with ARDS, low dose non-nomogram heparin infusion may reduce risk of major bleeding while still protecting from thrombotic events. There is no data available for this treatment strategy in intubated patients without ARDS. 7. Patients treated with low dose anticoagulation protocols should be transitioned to full dose anticoagulation when no longer ICU status. 8. Referral for CT PE or duplex may be performed once patient has recovered as an inpatient, however, may need to be completed in the outpatient setting in a resource scarce setting. CVC venous clinics (or hematology, if a consulting service as inpatient) will provide continuity of care in reviewing these outpatient imaging tests and providing long term anticoagulation recommendations to the patient, thereby expediting discharges without the burden of additional testing and relieving inpatient providers of burden of follow up. 9. Upper extremity duplex ultrasonography should be limited to patients with unilateral limb symptoms and criteria as listed in #4 and should not be performed routinely.

Introduction 2 The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) traditionally relies upon assessment of 3 the patient for history and physical exam findings consistent with the diagnosis, risk 4 stratification, then imaging with duplex ultrasonography for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or 5 with computed tomography (CT-PE) for pulmonary embolism. 1 This common diagnosis and its 6 work up are a familiar thread in the fabric of all emergency departments, inpatient wards and 7 intensive care units across the country and the world.

In patients 7 meeting these criteria, the following protocol reduced the risk of VTE and primary pulmonary 8 thrombi without increasing bleeding complications: initiation of non-nomogram heparin infusion 9 with a goal Xa between 0.2-0.3; no bolus dose administered. The lower Xa is necessary given 10 the risk of bleeding with hemorrhagic pneumonitis. Of note, this goal Xa does not match with an 11 existing heparin nomogram at our institution, and requires manual titration by the inpatient 12 team. 11 It therefore may be a reasonable, although untested, strategy to utilize the ACS 13 nomogram with lower Xa ranges (0.2-0.5) to reduce clinician workload if bleeding risk is 14 acceptable(Table II).

The intubated, critically ill patient who is low risk by the Wells' 4 score may qualify for empiric lower dose anticoagulation if their bleeding risk is low (Figures 3 5 and 4). Higher consideration should be given to empiric low dose anticoagulation if the P/F 6 ratio is less than 200.
