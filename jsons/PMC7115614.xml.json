            "text": "Even though l-ascorbic acid (L-ASA) cancer therapy has a controversial history [1], interest in L-ASA has been renewed due to its recently demonstrated ability to selectively kill cancer cells [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. It was shown that L-ASA inhibits the growth of KRAS and BRAF mutant colorectal cancer cells by causing oxidative stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the latter leading to inactivation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), an energy crisis and consequently cell death [6]. l-ascorbic acid is an established activator of non-heme iron \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) dioxygenases, such as hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases (HIF PHD), and epigenetic ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which are directly relevant to cancer susceptibility and progression [7,8]. HIF-1 is a critical mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia, making it an attractive molecular target for anticancer therapy. Hydroxylation of proline in HIF-1\u03b1 under normoxia tags it for subsequent ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation [9]. Activation of the enzyme HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibits the HIF-triggered antihypoxic program, the latter being the adaptive response of malignant tumors to hypoxic stress. Such activation was recently observed by l-ascorbic acid and its 2-phosphate derivative that promoted tumor cells death [10,11]. Furthermore, recent progress in the epigenetics identified a new role of ascorbate in the regulation of the demethylation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins [12]. It was found that L-ASA acts as a direct regulator of TET activity and DNA methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, thus indicating its potential application for treating cancers driven by aberrant DNA methylation in the clinic [13]. l-ascorbate also showed a selective killing effect against various human breast cancer cell lines which was dependent on the sodium-vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT-2) expression responsible for l-ascorbate uptake [14]. Some 1,2,4-triazole and imidazole L-ASA derivatives exerted a pronounced cytostatic effect in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [15]. Moreover, pyrimidine and purine derivatives of 6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid and 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-l-ascorbic acid derivatives showed antiproliferative effect in a panel of tumor cells and antiviral potency against VZV and CMV (Fig. 1\n) [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. It was observed that 2,3-O,O-dibenzyl-l-ascorbic acid derivatives exhibited better growth inhibition of malignant tumor cells and antiviral activity than their 2,3-dihydroxy analogues.",

Benzenesulfonamide-based terminal alkynes 7q\u22127t were prepared in a reaction of propargylamine and corresponding benzenesulfonyl chlorides [32], while tert-butyl 4-((prop-2-ynylthio)carbonothioyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (7u) was synthesized via reaction of piperazine with carbon disulfide (CS2) and propargyl bromide in the presence of a base [33]. Following method A (Scheme 1), the best yields of 72% and 71% were obtained in the synthesis of compounds 8n and 8o with branched 4-tert-butyl and 4-(3-chloropropyl) side chains, respectively. Optimization of reactions was performed using another synthetic pathway (Scheme 1, method B). Method B represents a convenient one-pot two-step procedure to obtain the target compounds by the in situ generation of azide 6 via reaction of the monotosylated l-ascorbic acid derivative 4 with sodium azide, and followed by CuAAC reaction of azide 4 and corresponding alkyne to afford 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of l-ascorbic acid 8a\u22128u. For environmental reasons, the microwave-assisted reactions were performed in both methods over a period of 1 h for completion of the reaction. However, comparing the yields of the two synthetic pathways, it can be concluded that the method A, that included the isolation of the C-6 azido derivative 6, was generally more successful than the one-pot procedure (method B).",

L-ASA itself was also lacking any cytostatic effect. Among l-ascorbic acid derivatives 8c\u22128j containing 4-aryl-substituted 1,2,3-triazole, the p-bromophenyl substituent in 8e caused a strong inhibitory effect on all tumor cell lines, particularly against lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549: IC50 = 0.75 \u03bcM). While the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl-in 8c and fluoro-substituted aromatic moiety in 8d had a small influence on the antiproliferative effect, the electron-donating methyl group in 8f caused selectivity in the cytostatic activity. This compound strongly inhibited the growth of lung adenocarcinoma (A549: IC50 = 8.69 \u03bcM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2: IC50 = 8.77 \u03bcM) cell lines. A longer alkyl substituent, such as 4-pentyl, at the phenyl moiety in 8j also contributed to marked albeit non-specific cytostatic activity. On the contrary, p-methoxy and o-methoxy, as well as p-hydroxy substituents at the phenyl in 8g, 8h and 8i, respectively, did not have a significant impact on the antiproliferative effect on tumor cell lines. However, both p-methoxy and o-methoxy substituents had a pronounced cytotoxicity on normal fibroblasts (HFF). From compounds with a 4-aliphatic-substituted 1,2,3-triazole, long straight 4-decyl and branched 4-tert-butyl in 8m and 8n, respectively, had a strong effect on cytostatic activity, particularly on breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. Thus, these compounds exhibited antitumor activity against MCF-7 cells in nM range (8m: IC50 = 0.08 \u03bcM; 8n: IC50 = 0.73 \u03bcM). However, compound 8n was also cytotoxic to normal fibroblasts (IC50 = 13.33 \u03bcM), while 8m showed to be nontoxic (IC50 > 100 \u03bcM).",

Besides having pro-carcinogenic effects, some reports indicated that stabilization of HIF-1 in breast cancer cells decreases cancer cells growth by promoting the cell cycle arrest and autophagy [[42], [43], [44]]. It was also found that several cellular responses to HIF-1 are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and vice versa. A complex relationship between HIF-1, NO and cancer has been thus explored [44,45] where it was shown that a biphasic response to NO occurs in HIF-1 regulation. Indeed, NO initially inhibits HIF PHD activity that leads to HIF-1 accumulation in the cell which in turn results in increased HIF PHD levels that then prevent HIF-1 accumulation at later stages [45]. In breast cancer tissues, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity is higher, especially in highly invasive tumors [46]. Accordingly, the relative expression analysis of HIF-1\u03b1 (hydroxylated form at position Pro564) and NOS2 proteins\u2019 levels, as potential targets of the chosen candidate structure 8m, was performed (Fig. 5\n). Proline hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1 is known to lead to von Hippel-Lindau protein-dependent ubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation, which means that measurement of increased levels of this HIF-1\u03b1 form is indicative for regulation of the HIF-1\u03b1 levels in tumor cells.",

Antiproliferative evaluations on a panel of tumor cell lines showed that both type of substituents at C-4 of 1,2,3-triazole and the linker connecting the lactone and 1,2,3-triazole units had an impact on growth inhibitory activity. The p-bromophenyl substituent in 8e caused a strong, albeit not highly specific inhibitory effect on all tested cell lines, where the strongest effect (IC50 = 0.75 \u03bcM) was observed on lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Long straight 4-decyl in 8m and branched 4-tert-butyl in 8n contributed to marked cytostatic activity (8m: IC50 = 0.08 \u03bcM; 8n: IC50 = 0.73 \u03bcM) on breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). However, compound 8n was cytotoxic to normal fibroblasts, while 8m showed to be nontoxic and the most lipophilic compound from the 8a\u22128u series, with clogP 5.25. Within the 4,5-unsaturated 10c\u221210p series, 4-tert-butyl-substituted structural analogue 10n had the most potent inhibitory activity on A549 and MCF-7 cells. However, it exhibited considerably reduced antiproliferative activity on MCF-7 compared to its analogue 8n. A more detailed investigation of the mechanism of action for the selected candidate 8m showed that this compound induced cell death of breast cancer MCF-7 cells, partially due to apoptosis induction. Moreover, 8m was shown to affect the HIF-1\u03b1 signalling pathway, as it enhanced expression of the hydroxylated HIF-1\u03b1 form, tagged for degradation and concomitantly decreasing expression of NOS2.",

All data were recorded in DMSO\u2011d\n6 at 298 K. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solvent signal of DMSO at \u03b4 2.50 ppm for 1H and \u03b4 39.50 ppm for 13C. Individual resonances were assigned on the basis of their chemical shifts, signal intensities, multiplicity of resonances and H\u2013H coupling constants. Mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6410 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, USA) equipped with an electrospray interface and triple quadrupole analyzer (LC/MS/MS). Microwave-assisted synthesis was performed in a Milestone start S microwave oven using quartz cuvette (1 cm) under the pressure of 40 bar. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on Applied Biosystems 4800 Plus Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer. All elemental compositions were within the 0.4% of the calculated values.",

Confluent HEL fibroblasts were grown in 96-well microtiter plates and infected with the human CMV strains Davis and AD-169 at 100 PFU per well. After a 2 h incubation period, residual virus was removed and the infected cells were further incubated with the medium containing different concentrations of the compounds tested (in duplicate). After incubation for 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, virus-induced cytopathogenicity was monitored microscopically and after ethanol fixation and staining with Giemsa (for CMV and VZV). Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicy by 50%. EC50 values were calculated from graphic plots of the percentage of cytopathogenicity as a function of the concentration of the compounds. Cytostatic measurements based on the inhibition of HEL cell growth were performed as follows: HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 x 103 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required to reduce cell growth by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds.
