Such therapies are often highly effective for rheumatic disease treatment but can increase the risk of serious infections1, which has raised concern that these individuals might be more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 than the general population.",

According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, as of the 27th of March 2020, in Italy alone 80,589 patients had been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 8,215 fatalities had occurred. Doctors in Italy have been forced to face excruciating decisions about which patients should receive access to limited resources such as mechanical ventilation2. The severe nature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection also exacerbates resource limitations, as patients often need 15\u201320 days of ventilation2. Many patients are severely or critically ill, and fatality rates have been higher than for viruses such as influenza3. Within this context, rheumatologists are understandably worried that COVID-19 could pose a considerable risk to their patients.",

Existing literature suggests that there is a substantial increase in serious infections in those treated with commonly used anti-rheumatic agents such as biologic drugs, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and glucocorticoids1, and there is a particular risk of Herpes zoster infection in those patients receiving JAK inhibitors5. However, extrapolation of this data to SARS-CoV-2 infection is problematic given the heterogeneity in specific drug-associated adverse events and the potentially protective role of immunosuppressive drugs in abating a severe inflammatory response to infection. During previous coronavirus epidemics, such as the 2002\u20132003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the MERS-CoV that has caused sporadic infections globally since 2012, comorbid disease or diabetes portended a worse outcome in some reports6,7, but not in others8. However, only limited data on the disease course of those taking immunosuppressive therapies and who contracted SARS or MERS have been published to date, restricting inferences from these previous coronavirus outbreaks9.",

The rheumatology community has responded rapidly, with a group of over 300 rheumatologists, scientists and patients from around the world forming The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance over the course of a few days. Remarkably, the idea for the alliance was initially formed through conversations on social media, with Twitter facilitating a rapid information exchange between researchers and clinicians. International collaborators from across six continents were recruited from personal and professional networks to provide complementary areas of expertise. Over a period of days, alliance members swiftly began work on four distinct projects that would address the overall goal of efficiently gathering data regarding patients with rheumatic diseases and immunosuppressive medications during the rapidly evolving pandemic: a registry for physicians around the world to report cases of COVID-19; analyses of insurer health claims data; systematic literature reviews; and partnerships with researchers who were conducting patient-facing research. Over 100 professional societies, institutions and organizations from around the world have joined the alliance and are supporting its mission, including this journal.",

Given the need for global collaboration, data is being collected for the registry through a survey that is accessible to clinicians on the registry website. Data on patient demographics, rheumatic disease phenotypes, comorbidities, immunosuppressive and other drug therapies and COVID-19 outcomes will be collected. The registry has been determined \u2018not human subjects research\u2019 under US Federal Guidelines by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board (IRB): a category that covers activities such as quality improvement and surveillance. No patient identifiers such as name or date of birth will be collected. International partners in Europe and elsewhere are working to address issues related to regional IRBs.

Such data will help the rheumatology community to generate hypotheses regarding risk and therapy and to provide information to physicians and patients in the short-term. Longer term, the data might serve as preliminary information for the design of larger, systematic studies that address outcomes in specific sub-groups of patients or on the management of immunosuppressive therapies during infection. Although the rapid accumulation and dissemination of information is critically important during this pandemic, the alliance also recognizes that the initial data will have limitations and will need to be interpreted conservatively. Issues such as the lack of a control group and a probable reporting bias of more severe cases will limit conclusions about epidemiology and causal inference. The registry will hopefully enable the rapid global exchange of case information to inform the design of studies that can address these important issues in the future.",
