Most effective methods currently are empirical in nature and their relation to parameters of interest to administrators are not evident. We thus propose a modified SEIRD model that is capable of modeling effect of interventions and in migrations on the progress of an epidemic. The tunable parameters of this model bear relevance to monitoring of an epidemic. This model was used to show that some of the commonly seen features of cumulative infections in real data can be explained by piece wise constant changes in interventions and population influx. We also show that the data of cumulative infections from twelve Indian states between mid March and mid April 2020 can be generated from the model by applying interventions according to a set of heuristic rules. Prediction for the next ten days based on this model, reproduced real data very well. In addition, our model also reproduced the time series of recoveries and deaths. Our work constitutes an important first step towards an effective dashboard for the monitoring of epidemic by the administration, especially in an Indian context.",

            "text": "Mathematical treatment of epidemics has its origins more than a century ago [1, 2] . The recent interest in modeling epidemics was rekindled with the onset of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemics during the early part of the century [3] . The classical model of epidemics (SIR) was designed as a dynamical system with the fraction of Susceptible(S), Infected(I) and Recovered(R) population as state variables. The SARS epidemics were modeled with a modified model with an additional state for the fraction of exposed population(E) that is latent and as yet uninfected, but still contributes to spreading the disease. This modified model, the SEIR model, is currently being used to characterize the epidemics caused by a group of coronaviruses including the ongoing COVID-19 [3] . Modified SEIR models have also been designed to understand the effect of quarantining [3] and multiple active strains of the pathogen simultaneously active in populations [4] . SIR, SEIR and related models are also known as compartment models, as population groups are modeled as a single compartment. In contrast, agent-based approaches, model the transitions of individual agents in a population and hence can capture the effects of non-homogenous populations. While agent based and stochastic models [5] have been explored, it has been shown that for people to people contact networks that are small world, random, fully connected or scale free, the compartmental models work quite well [6] . Thus, compartmental models are an efficient tool for modeling epidemics.",

The emergence of R 0 in epidemiology owes its origins to the mathematics of population growth, and in past few decades, emerged as an important diagnostic of the epidemic progression [7, 8] . R 0 owes its importance [9] to the fact that, it is a prognosticator of the epidemic, with values less than 1 indicating a fade out and values greater than 1 prognosticating a large scale epidemics. R 0 can easily be calculated from the set of differential equations describing SIR and SEIR systems [7] .",

While R 0 is the value of R at the start of the epidemic, R t represents its evolution with time t. The change in R t with time could be due to a number of factors, namely a change in transmission \u03b2 or an intervention in the form of lockdowns, social distancing, testing and / or quarantining. While the dynamics of transmission of epidemic diseases are well understood, estimating these parameters during the course of an ongoing epidemic is not trivial, except in special circumstances of small isolated population clusters as in the quarantined cruise ship [11] . For the purposes of monitoring and predicting the course of an ongoing epidemic, the most important metric used is r, the slope of the cumulative infections on the log scale. This follows from the observation that the rate of new infections is proportional to the cumulative infections. The parameters r and R are related to each other through the shape of the serial interval distribution [12, 13] . Since the cumulative deaths follow the infections with a lag, the cumulative death count has also been used to estimate the parameters of the epidemic model [14] . R has also been estimated using maximum likelihood based methods from the serial intervals distribution for subsets of populations where the chain of infection transmission are documented [15] .",

First, the class of mechanistic models which use modified SEIR compartment models to simulate epidemics.

The mechanistic models are largely used to evolve strategies for management of the epidemic -like evaluate effect of social distancing, lockdowns, exits from lockdowns [16] , projection for periodic recurrence of outbreaks and impact of multiple strains of the pathogen [4] . The parameters and formulations used in these methods are grounded in epidemiology theory and are useful to evolve broad strategies. But they are not frequently used for short or medium term prediction of trends or evaluation of efficacy of interventions in real time.

Foremost among these are the gap between observed and true variables like infections and recoveries. This is less of a problem in case of deaths, as they are not easily hidden, which was used in estimation [14] . However, it requires about 2-3 weeks for the effect of interventions to be reflected in the number of deaths, which severely limits the utility of the method for real time analysis. Empirical methods have a general limitation that they make assumptions on various parameters like serial interval distributions or the form of priors [14, 17] . Due to the lack of mechanistic details, the results of these methods are often incapable of offering intuitive explanations on how interventions work or fail. Mechanistic methods require that standard models be modified to incorporate interventions, testing efficacies and quarantining often making estimation of R t very difficult. Over and above all of these, we believe that a common shortcoming in most mechanistic models proposed are a conflation of observables and non-observables. For instance, the deaths and recoveries are almost always modeled as single compartments and outcomes resulting from both detected and undetected infections move into the same compartment, although one is observable and the other is only partially so [3, 4, 16, 18] .",

We propose a mechanistic model that retains the simplicity of the standard SEIR model, but with the power to model interventions and time varying transmission. A key constraint we impose on our model is that while it should be able to explain short term trends and effects of interventions, it must also be capable of providing intuitive connections between observed trends and changes in underlying parameters. In this work we present one such SEIR model suitably modified to model interventions. We then proceed to demonstrate how changes in model parameters can generate oft-seen patterns in cumulative infections on the logarithmic scale. Based on these results, we propose heuristic algorithm for estimating time varying interventions that recreate trends in cumulative infections by applying suitable interventions, thereby estimating the underlying changes in epidemic dynamics. We use this method to recreate the real data from 12 Indian states between mid-March and mid-April. We finally observe how this model fares in predicting the trends of the succeeding 10 day period.",

Data of daily infections, recoveries and deaths between 13 th March 2020 and 17 th April 2020 for all Indian states were obtained from www.covid19india.org. We chose 12 states with active COVID-19 cases for our analysis. The states chosen were Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal. Using the data upto 17 th April 2020, we use a heuristic algorithm to generate these trends from our model. The algorithm will be derived from the results of model characterisation and will be described in section on Model Characterization. The goal of this exercise was to identify the time varying piece wise constant functions for c, q, \u03b2 and \u03c6.pI that result in best visual fit of the cumulative infections on the log scale. The focus was on reproducing the predominant features of data sets on the log scale such as, piecewise linear slopes, steepening of slopes, plateauing effects and changing y-intercepts with constant slope. We did not use any empirical learning methods for discovery of these parameters as we were keen on developing intuition regarding the relation between trend patterns and their underlying processes. Once the cumulative data of infections was well fit, no further changes in parameters were undertaken except for tuning \u03b4 in order to bring the curve of cumulative deaths within the band defined by the curves D q and D q + D. This band was necessitated because deaths reported are sometimes from one or both buckets. Ever since the Indian government has mandated the testing of all Severe Acute Respiratory infections for COVID-19, undetected infections have been confirmed positive for COVID-19 from time to time in ICUs and post mortem.

Effect of varying \u03b2 and c with fixed R t It is well known that as R t increases, the infections peak earlier and have higher peaks. But from the equation 1 we can see that same R t can be achieved by varying combinations of \u03b2 and intervention inefficiencies. To understand this effect, we fixed R t at 3 and varied numerators of transmission rate (\u03b2) were set successively at values between 6 and 8.4. c was varied to obtain required R t as per Eqn. 1 in the Model parameters section. From Eqn. 1, we can observe that at constant R t , increase in \u03b2 will have to be accompanied by a decrease in inefficiency (1 \u2212 c) 2 and a consequent increase in efficiency (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c) 2 ) and detection c. Latency of infection is set at 7 days, efficiency of random testing and self-presentation (q) is set at 0, influx of population (\u03c6 * pI) is set at 0. Initial infected cluster is set at 1 for a state with a population of one million and it is assumed that epidemic is at contact transmission stage (Stage-2).",

Since only the undetected infections influence transmission, \u03b2 ef f , R t and time course of epidemic remain same, while the peak of reported infections are higher as can be seen in Fig.3(a) . Fig. 4a and c. Similarly decreasing R t decreases the slope and later peaks. However at the same R t , the peak values of infections are proportional to \u03b2. This is evident from the Fig. 4c where grey and indigo curves have taller peaks, but red and blue curves have shorter peaks compared to corresponding peaks in 4a. Note that the correspondence is between the pairs of curves in gray and blue, red and indigo. Fig. 5 describes the effects of an influx of infected individuals into the population. It can be seen that this influx does not change the slope of the trajectory. Rather, the trajectory maintains its slope, but now has an increased y intercept. Influxes over windows of 3, 9 and 18 days have progressively larger y intercepts as seen in Fig. 5b and the peaks occur earlier in time as seen in Fig. 5a . However the change in y intercepts are not uniform. Another significant effect is that the excess infections due to this influx are constant on the log scale. Thus with time, the cost of this influx become progressively larger in absolute terms.",

As already seen in section on Effect of infected cohort, an influx accompanied by no response in the form of change in contact tracing efficiency results in a trajectory that runs parallel to the original trajectory with increased y intercept. However if as a response to the influx, the level of contact tracing is increased concurrent with the first day of influx, it leads to a peculiar 2 phase change in trajectory. There is a steep increase in slope almost instantaneously on increase of c, followed by a significant reduction in slope with respect to the original slope. With increasing levels of contact tracing c, the sharp increase in the initial phase is even steeper, and so is the flattening that follows. The initial steep rise can be attributed to large numbers of infections being detected and quarantined due to increased contact-tracing efforts. This results in a drastic reduction in the slope soon after, as quarantined infected cannot spread the disease. This effect leads to a characteristic plateauing effect. When the intervention is delayed, the plateau effect seen is identical in nature but shifted in time. Hence the resultant flattening is achieved at a higher level of infections.",

This could explain the lag of about 8 days which is required to fit the real data with the model generated output. 3 The real recoveries seem to follow the model generated curves, but with a staircase effect. This effect could possibly be due to a procedural issue where test reports are processed in batches on a slightly lower priority(which recoveries are compared to critical cases). The full details of the piece wise constant functions used for each state in reconstruction and the reasoning applied to generate the same can be found in the supplementary materials. Supplementary materials also include an evaluation of the predictions based on the same model for an epoch of 20 days upto 7 th May 2020. It can now be seen that as expected there are significant deviations in prediction for 5 states. This is expected as small underlying changes in the intervening period widen the gap between real data and prediction. But it is also significant that for more than half the states considered, predictions held well over a 20 day epoch. However in general we believe that this model must be evaluated weekly to recognise and register the underlying dynamic changes in the epidemic progress.

The model with interventions so designed was allowed to generate prediction data for ten more days with no further modifications.

Compared to empirical measures [14, 19, 17] this method recreates data using parameters that are intuitive and directly related to operation on the field. While similar to other mechanistic models [3, 4, 16] , it differs in its design focus on separating observable and non observable compartments. Connecting elementary piece wise changes in interventions to features of real data like slopes and plateaus are a singular contribution of this work. While the piece wise constant form of interventions have been proposed [14] , instead of creating interventions functions based on known events and identifying their contributions to data fit, we compose the piece wise interventions directly based on intuitive connections between data features and elementary piece wise functions of interventions.",

It presents a method by which administration may get an objective estimate of several aspects of an ongoing epidemic such as the efficacy of contact tracing apparatus, possible influx of infected, extent of social distancing or transmission. The parameters c and q as fraction of infected detected are generic enough for a wide variety of cases. While administrations may use a wide variety of methods to characterize their testing or tracing strategies, their eventual success lies in tracing or detecting all infected, which is what is captured by c and q. Thus insights from our model provides an independent and objective feedback on how effective the efforts have been. This model also provides an estimate of R t which is highly sought after and provides insights on whether the observed R t results from interventions or transmission. The population influx mechanisms provide a way for administrations to estimate the effect of influx in the past and plan for impending arrivals and calibrate their responses.",

The insights coming out of our models must be interpreted in the context of the specific clusters contributing to the epidemic. For instance increased or unchanged transmission does not imply that general population flouted lock down rules. It must instead be interpreted specifically as applicable to the specific clusters of spread. \u03b2 is interpreted as the product of contact rate and probability of transmission. Thus large captive households or even hospitals can keep the contact rates high without any flouting of norms. Again, influx of infected in its general sense represents a seeding of infection. Thus an influx of population indicated by our results could as well imply the emergence of a new infection cluster.",

Our model design principles are generic enough to be applied to model extensions incorporating hospitalized or critical cases. Since the model captures the active cases as a function of response of the administrative response, this can be a valuable tool to plan and allocate resources and deploy the right response, where necessary. This model can further be extended to estimate the effort required for achieving a level of contact tracing c or testing q. This can be of vital importance for the administration in planning their strategies and estimating requirements of health workers, law enforcement agencies for contact tracing. We currently manually fit the parameters to evolution of active cases in each of the 10 states using heuristics. Going forward, the manually obtained piece wise interventions may be treated as seed for empirical discovery of piece wise functions. Further incorporating confidence intervals for our current predictions will be an important goal of future work.",
