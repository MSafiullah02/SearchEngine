The study was conducted in a simulated patient care environment, with a study team member acting as the patient. The simulated patient followed a specific narrative for the scenario and engaged in conversation with the HCW during the patient care encounter. The simulation room had features of a typical patient care room, including a hospital bed, wall unit with pressurized air, storage cabinets, television, bedside table, and tray table. Immediately outside the room were an isolation cart and handwashing facilities. The room had two discretely mounted cameras in the ceiling that could be positioned and focused in real time from a neighboring viewing room. The cameras fed into an audiovisual retrieval system to which the digital videos could be downloaded from secured system servers for data analysis. In addition, another high-definition digital camera was strategically placed outside the room to better capture the HCW\u2019s PPE donning and room exiting behaviors. This allowed for consistent capturing of the underlying sources of contamination for each HCW during the 3 stages of the simulation: PPE donning, patient care, and PPE doffing. All study participants were made aware of the videorecording during the consent process.",

The simulated patient\u2019s IV site was connected to IV tubing, and an empty reservoir was hidden under the gown to collect the running IV fluid and simulated IV pain medication. Respiratory therapists assessed the patient and administered a nebulizer treatment consisting of normal saline instead of a medication. Nursing assistants repositioned the patient from bed to chair, took vital signs, and conducted input and output documentation.

Although this randomization was not necessary for a feasibility study with such a small sample, it allowed for observation of the participants\u2019 responses to the additional guidance and may guide interventions considered for future studies. The isolation cart was stocked with gowns, gloves, procedure masks, N95 respirators, and multiple styles of protective eyewear. Each participant was verbally given a patient scenario, and a patient chart and typical isolation signage were posted at the room\u2019s door. No other guidance on appropriate PPE was given. A powdered fluorescent marker was spread in areas of the room where patient contamination commonly occurs, including the bedrails, bedside table, and the simulated patient\u2019s gown front and arms. Contaminated areas were assessed between study participants using an ultraviolet light to ensure that the same areas of contamination were dusted with fluorescent marker for each participant. Other areas in the room potentially contaminated with fluorescent marker during the simulated patient care were assessed using the ultraviolet light after each encounter and cleaned. The fluorescent marker is easily removed using a damp towel. The study participants consented to the study fully aware that the fluorescent marker was present in the simulated patient care room, due to the minor risk for sensitivity to the powder.",

The most common breaches in PPE donning were not conducting a seal check on the respirator, failing to tie the gown at both the neck and the waist, and donning the equipment in the improper sequence. The most common breaches in PPE doffing were related to the sequence of equipment removal, removing the respirator, and removing potentially contaminated items from the room.

In a pandemic simulation exercise conducted over 24 hours in a nursing unit following procedures mandated by the United Kingdom pandemic influenza infection control guideline, HCWs demonstrated uncertainty in such areas as donning and removal of PPE and decontamination of room equipment.18 Retrospective reviews of outbreaks such as SARS and novel H1N1 have shown inconsistent use of PPE in HCWs who developed infection. Possible barriers to adherence in these outbreaks may include personal beliefs, fatigue, inadequate training or systematic approaches, and lack of PPE supplies.12, 16 The results of these previous studies support the need for further studies related to training in and reinforcement of PPE techniques for HCWs.",

Reasons for noncompliance with hand hygiene have been studied in depth.19 Our finding that 3 participants entered the patient room and 2 participants exited the room without performing hand hygiene is notable, especially considering that the participants knew that they were being evaluated. As noted previously, a compliance study using videotaping by Hassan et al16 found similar low levels of compliance with handwashing in an actual patient care setting. Actions such as neglecting to check the seal of the mask or neglecting to tie the gown at both the neck and the waist have been commonly observed in practice by the research team. Some of the actions observed in the present study were less predictable, such as leaving the room without completing the doffing sequence and unnecessarily touching surfaces in the room. The number of participants who performed PPE donning and doffing out of sequence was higher than expected. We had anticipated a smaller number in the group that had access to the CDC guideline poster in the donning and doffing areas, but that did not prove to be the case.",

The participants sometimes put their gloved hands on surfaces contaminated with the fluorescent marker and then touched an area such as the face. We were not always able to document the transfer to the face under the black light when we evaluated the individual for fluorescent marker contamination once he or she completed the simulation experience. In some other cases, small paper towel fragments on the participant\u2019s hands following hand hygiene initially appeared to be massive contamination of the hands with the fluorescent marker. This might have skewed our data related to hand contamination. This problem possibly could be resolved in future studies by using a different color of powdered fluorescent marker. The most common location of actual fluorescent marker contamination was on the back of the head, which the review of the video capture identified as resulting from an incorrect PPE doffing sequence. Casanova et al14 used the same fluorescent marker in their study on removing PPE in 10 participants, but they directly contaminated the surface of the PPE before the patient care task and PPE removal. They also found the fluorescent marker to be an inconsistent contamination indicator. The use of a fluorescent maker alone in training scenarios might not adequately demonstrate the potential for transfer of infectious materials and might inadvertently reinforce poor technique. The video recording seems to provide a more reliable account of HCW behaviors.",
