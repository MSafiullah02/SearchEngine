            "text": "Murine coronaviruses induce a variety of diseases, including hepatitis, enteritis and encephalitis in mice, depending on the virus strain, infection route, age, genetic background and immune status of the hosts (Kyuwa and Stohlman, 1990, Compton et al., 1993). Due to frequent outbreaks of murine coronavirus infection in laboratory animal facilities, the viruses are detested as the most detrimental infectious agent for laboratory mice. On the other hand, experimental murine coronavirus infections provide useful animal models of human diseases. In particular, murine coronavirus-induced demyelination is utilized in investigating the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis in humans (Liu et al., 2000, Marten et al., 2000, Wu et al., 2000). We previously reported a reduced viral clearance and a resultant systemic persistent infection associated with disseminated granulomatous serositis in IFN-\u03b3-deficient C57BL/6 (B6-GKO) mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with murine coronavirus, strain JHM (JHMV) (Kyuwa et al., 1998). The disease bears a resemblance to feline infectious peritonitis, another coronavirus-induced fatal disease in cats. The same disease was also observed in naturally infected B6 mice deficient in IFN-\u03b3 (France et al., 1999) as well as IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 double knockout mice (Boivin and Smith, 1998). This experimental infection may provide a unique model to examine the pathological mechanism of virus-induced peritonitis.",

For example, whereas SJL/J mice are resistant to intracerebral JHMV infection, other strains of laboratory mice are susceptible (Stohlman and Frelinger, 1978). Recently, it has been shown that the virus receptor genotype is correlated with susceptibility (Ohtsuka and Taguchi, 1997). The genetic profile of the mouse susceptible to MHV-3, another murine coronavirus, is distinct from that of JHMV (Levy et al., 1981), suggesting the complexity of susceptibility to murine coronavirus infection in vivo.",

High serum ALT activity and massive necrosis of the liver suggest that the mice died due to acute hepatic failure. The same disease was not observed in heterozygous or wild type mice with the same background and administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b3 into BALB-GKO mice, in part, protected the virus-induced acute death. These results suggest that IFN-\u03b3 play an essential role in protecting mice with a BALB/c background from JHMV infection. The disease, however, was noticeably distinct from subacute granulomatous peritonitis in IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice with a B6 background that we reported previously (Kyuwa et al., 1998). Whereas hepatitis was observed in B6-GKO mice in the acute phase, it was not progressing and had been almost cured in the subacute phase when granulomatous peritonitis was evident (Kyuwa et al., 1998). This result was unexpected, because wild type mice with both genetic backgrounds are resistant to i.p. infection with JHMV (Kyuwa et al., 1988, Kyuwa et al., 1996, Stohlman et al., 1992) and both strains have the same genotype of MHV receptor (Ceacam1) that is believed to be important in determining mouse susceptibility (Ohtsuka and Taguchi, 1997). Taken together, the data presented here suggest that genetic factor(s) other than IFN-\u03b3 or MHV receptor affect MHV infection in mice.",

In a reconstitution experiment, we could protect only half of JHMV-infected BALB-GKO mice by administration of IFN-\u03b3 2 h before and 1 day after infection.
