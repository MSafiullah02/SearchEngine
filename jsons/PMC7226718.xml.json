            "text": "A novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 [1]. By February 13, 2020, more than 60,000 cases were confirmed, nearly 50,000 in Hubei alone, and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [3]. Considering the current rate of human to human transmission, most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global COVID-19 pandemic. China is on the frontline in the fight against the virus, and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak. Medical testing tools and personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face shields, goggles, and gloves, have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers, with severe shortage in Hubei, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. A report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in Wuhan showed that from December 25, 2019, to February 6, 2020, eight COVID-19 suspected patients were admitted, and three were confirmed. Consequently, 12 medical personnel were infected (11 nurses and one doctor), among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case. According to the data released by the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People\u2019s Republic of China, a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide, accounting for 3.8% of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on February 11, 2020, of which six (0.4%) had died. Of these, Hubei Province reported 1502 cases, accounting for 87.5% of the total medical personnel infections, while Wuhan City reported 1102 cases, accounting for 73.4% [4]. Notably, medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak. How to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.",

Therefore, a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure, and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants. The patient should wear a medical mask, and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining.",

In addition, nine COVID-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery, but in all of these patients, COVID-19 was diagnosed postoperatively.

For stab wounds, the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined. For gunshot wounds, due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles, the tortuous wound path, and the heavy tissue damage, the scanning range should be expanded appropriately. Patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy, such as traffic injuries, should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh (including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury). Enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury, and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected.",

According to practice in China, some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns, two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic. Instead of enhancing protective effects, such excessive protection can reduce the visual, auditory, and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon, thus reducing the precision of surgical operations (Fig. 2). The influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes (1) difficulty breathing, (2) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision, (3) constriction of visual fields, (4) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves, and (5) double or triple the duration of the operation. A practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected COVID-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor. The surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including N95 respirators or PAPR, and full coverage with protective gowns (shoe covers included) and sterile surgical gowns. Consequently, an operation that would have taken 2\u20133 h ended up taking 10 h. Possible solutions for reducing the impact of PPE on surgery include reducing the OR temperature (minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision. All PPEs are fit for single use except PAPR. The steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision (Fig. 3).\n",

Awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway, hypoxia, or unconsciousness. If face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation, multiple tools (fiberoptic bronchoscope, glide scope, light stick, laryngeal mask) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia.

It was not until February 12, 2020, that the official name COVID-19 was announced by the WHO [19, 20]. Shortly after the WHO announced the disease\u2019s official name, the virus causing it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, highlighting the new virus\u2019s similarity to the SARS virus identified in 2003 [21]. Based on epidemiological data up to Jan. 4, 2020, the estimated R0 was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) [20], while the latest study surveying cases up to Feb. 14, 2020, further calculated that the R0 of COVID-19 was 3.77 [11]. Therefore, researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability, SARS-CoV-2 was slightly higher than the SARS virus and significantly higher than the MERS-CoV [22]. According to clinical characteristic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, the mortality was 2.01% out of 28,018 cases as of Feb. 6, 2020 [23, 24]. By human-to-human transmission, SARS-CoV-2 had spread rapidly from Wuhan, China, to 24 other countries as of Feb. 12, 2020. The number of cases within China and other countries is rapidly increasing, and it is estimated that for every additional 10% decrease in transmission rate, the peak population will be reduced by 20\u201347%. The cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23\u201349% due to comprehensive interventions. If current interventions continue, it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early March 2020 [25]. Based on the epidemiological analysis, only 1.18% of the patients had direct contact with wild animals, 31.30% of the patients had been in Wuhan, and 71.80% of the patients had contact with people from Wuhan. Common symptoms included fever, cough, and diarrhea. A total of 76.4% of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia, with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings. Poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, and chest CT manifestations [24\u201326].",

The perspectives in this paper cannot be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 (Fig. 4).\n",

Areas with high incidence rates of COVID-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety. With the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research, some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges. The above is China\u2019s experience in treating trauma patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. We hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future COVID-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions.",
