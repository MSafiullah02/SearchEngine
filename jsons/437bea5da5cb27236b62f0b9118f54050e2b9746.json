            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the coronavirus family of the nidovirales order. MHV is an enveloped virus with single-stranded, positive genomic RNA of about 3 lkb. Infection of susceptible strains of mice with the MHV-JHM and A59 strains results in acute encephalomyelitis and chronic demyelinating disease with features similar to the human demyelination disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Because the mechanism of demyelination in MS is not completely understood, various experimental models, including MHV infection in mice, have been used to study the pathogenesis of inflammatory autoimmune demyelination. The spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV has been implicated as the most critical genomic determinant of MHV pathogenesis and demyelination. However, other genes and proteins are likely to contribute to MHV pathogenesis as well.",

The nucleotide sequence at the 5' end contains a 65 to 85 nucleotide-long leader RNA, followed by 200 to 500 non-translated nucleotides. The first 60% of the length of the genome, roughly 20 Kb from the 5' end, consists of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF la and lb, that encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, proteases and helicase. At the overlapping region between ORF la and lb there is a 7nucleotide slippery sequence and a pseudoknot structure, essential for ribosomal frame shifting. Several of the non-structural proteins are not essential for viral replication in vitro but may play a role in viral pathogenesis. An important aspect of MHV biology is the high frequency of RNA-RNA recombination between different, but closely related MHVs, when mixed in the same culture. RNA recombination is likely an important mechanism of viral evolution and may contribute to viral pathogenesis. ",

Each mRNA has a leader RNA of about 70 nucleotides at the 5' end [3] . The exchange of leader RNA is a common phenomenon during coronavirus replication and mRNA 1 can be synthesized during MHV infection with or without a 9nucleotide sequence (UUUAUAAAC) located immediately downstream of the leader RNA of the 5' terminus of MHV [4] . Studies of naturally occurring and artificially constructed defective interfering (DI) RNAs have shown that both 5'-and 3'-terminal portions of the MHV genome are required for making the Dis functional [5, 6] . More specifically, the 5' cisacting elements essential for MHV-JHM and A59 DI RNA replication have been mapped to 5' 474 nucleotides of which at least 446 nucleotides are required [6] . At the 3' end of the MHV genome 417 to 463 nucleotides is the minimal number of nucleotides required for replication [5] . Using interspecies-targeted RNA recombination, MHV-JHM gene 4 was genetically inactivated. Interestingly, the virus lacking gene 4 replicated in tissue culture cells with similar kinetics as the wild type virus. Thus ORF 4 is not essential for viral growth in tissue culture or in the CNS of the infected host [7] . Likewise, the deletion of the 2a/HE gene cluster did not affect viral growth in vitro; deletion of the 4/5a gene cluster merely decreased viral replication rate by 10 fold [8] .",

Mutations and deletions in the hypervariable region (HVR) suggested that the HVR was important for neurovirulence [25, [30] [31] [32] . In addition, the H716D amino acid substitution correlated with a delayed fusion phenotype, but without loss of hepatotropism [33, 34] . Q159L amino acid substitution affected hepatotropism and demyelination [35, 36] and L1114R (within the $2 region) has been speculated to play a role in the conformation of spike and in the dynamic interaction between S1 and $2 [37, 38] .

The weak neurotropic properties of MHV-2 made this strain ideal for a comparative study with the closely related, neurotropic, demyelinating strain MHV-A59 [52]. We first sequenced the entire genome of MHV-2 and compared it with that of MHV-A59 [52]. We then studied the role of the S gene in demyelination by replacing the S gene of MHV-A59 with that of MHV-2, using targeted RNA recombination. The new recombinant viruses (Penn98-1, 2) were more virulent than A59, but unable to induce demyelination in C57BL/6 mice [26].

All of these recombinant viruses were unable to induce demyelination in vivo. In vitro study ascertained that this group of recombinant viruses was able to replicate to the same titers as their parental viruses in L2 cells tissue cultures. Morphologically, the viruses ML-7, ML-8 and ML-10 produced large plaques and syncytia (similar to MHV-A59), whereas ML-11 produced small plaques as MHV-2. Sequencing of the S genes of ML-7, ML-8 and ML-10 revealed that they contained three common mutations, I375M, L652I, and T1087N [54] . The I375M mutation is located downstream from the receptor-binding site, the L652I mutation is located in the Hypervariable (HVR) region of the S gene and the T1087N mutation is located between the two-heptad repeat regions. Since these viruses were derived from a recombination between LA-7 and MHV-2, we also sequenced the S gene of LA-7 and we confirmed that the S gene of LA-7 contained the exact same three mutations implicating LA-7 as the source of these mutations. In addition, the sequence results of the S gene of ML-11 confirmed that the S gene of ML-11 was identical and was derived from to the S gene of MHV-2 [51].",

The recombinant viruses with the T1087N mutation (Penn99-1 and 2) were the most virulent (LD50=20,000pfu) among these recombinant viruses. The virulence of all other recombinant viruses, including the I375M point mutation (Penn01-1 and 2), the L652I point mutation (Penn01-3 and 4) and I375M-L652I two point mutation (Penn2K3 and 4) , I375M, and T1087N two point mutation (Penn01-5 and 6), L652I, and T1087N two point mutation (Penn01-7 and 8), were all significantly attenuated (LD50>50,000pfu). The reduced virulence correlated well with the reduced in severity of hepatitis and encephalitis. Interestingly, demyelination was not influenced by the reduction of virulence because most of the recombinant viruses with one or two combined amino acid mutations were significantly less virulent but demyelination-positive. It further confirmed that the induction of demyelination is a separate pathologic property that does not depend on the intensity of prior encephalitis or hepatitis during the acute phase [26] . Penn2K-3 and 4, the combination of mutations in S 1 (I375-M, L652I) did not produce demyelination in C57BL/6 mice even when mice were infected with the highest dose (50,000pfu, I.C.). We then searched for additional mutations around amino acid 375 and eventually found that N345S was a single point mutation that abolished demyelination (Fu et al, manuscript in preparation) . Thus we identified a region in the S1 gene downstream from the receptor-binding domain that controls demyelination.",

Crystallization studies will determine whether the three dimensional folding of this S1 region of the molecule may enable a spatial interaction between this site and the other two mutation sites which may affect viral host interaction and subsequently pathogenesis. More detailed mutagenesis, coupled with functional studies such as studies of receptor binding, S1-$2 separation, and fusion properties, will also be helpful in elucidating the mechanism of MHV neuropathogenesis.
