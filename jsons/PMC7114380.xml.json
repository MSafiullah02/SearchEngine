            "text": "Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order (Enjuanes et al., 2000). Coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses between 28 and 31 kb in length. CCoV is classified as group I by antigenic and genetic relationships (Enjuanes et al., 2000, Sanchez et al., 1990). CCoV has been experimentally demonstrated to produce mild gastroenteritis in dogs (Tennant et al., 1991). Clinically, CCoV has usually been found in conjunction with other organisms like canine adenovirus type 1 (Pratelli et al., 2001) or canine parvovirus type 2 (Carmichael, 1999). Changes in the sequences of structural spike glycoprotein (Ballesteros et al., 1997, Hingley et al., 2002, Phillips et al., 2002, Sanchez et al., 1999) and the non-structural protein 3b (nsp 3b) (Kim et al., 2000, Wesley et al., 1990) have been associated with differences in coronavirus strain virulence.",

RT-PCR consisted of an initial reverse transcription using Superscript III (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, followed by a PCR reaction using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche, East Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Once the consensus sequence was obtained, overlapping RT-PCRs of approximately 600 nucleotides were designed and run using HotStart Taq polymerase (QIAGEN, West Sussex, UK). PCRs were carried out as follows: 50 ng of cDNA template from reverse transcription (Fig 1A) was added to a PCR mix containing 2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of HotStartTaq\u2122 DNA polymerase (QIAGEN, West Sussex, UK) in PCR buffer 1x (QIAGEN, West Sussex, UK) to a final concentration of 1.5 mM MgCl2. PCR conditions consisted of an initial activation step of 95 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55\u201360 \u00b0C, depending on the primer pair, for 45 s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. PCR products for cloning and sequencing were cleaned using QIAquick (QIAGEN, West Sussex, UK). The most representative viral population was obtained by sequencing three independent RT-PCR reactions from three randomly chosen clinical samples. Direct sequencing from clinical samples was done to avoid in vitro selection of attenuated strains (Sanchez et al., 1999).",

Deletions in this region have already been described in virulent TGEV variants (McGoldrick et al., 1999) and may be associated with increased nsp 3b translation levels. The length of the transcription regulatory sequences has been shown to influence the level of transcription and translation in TGEV (Alonso et al., 2002). Interestingly, a nsp 3b protein of 250 amino acids is present, instead of the truncated form of 171 amino acids described for the attenuated Insavc-1 strain (Horsburgh et al., 1992). The truncated nsp 3b has been associated in survey studies with attenuated strains (Horsburgh et al., 1992, Kim et al., 2000, Wesley et al., 1990). The only reported experimental study of virulence of coronavirus group 1 involving the nsp 3b protein is difficult to interpret because of lack of experimental details such as animal health status, and the absence of administration of a known attenuated strain as a control (Festing et al., 2002, Sola et al., 2003). Therefore, we think that an increased amount of the full-length nsp 3b protein could be partially responsible for the increased in virulence that appears to be associated with CCoV-BGF.",

This region has previously been shown to be highly variable in other isolates and it has been postulated that it may be involved in escaping the host immune response in CCoV (Pratelli et al., 2002). The importance of the membrane protein in eliciting the humoral host immune response is not clear because monoclonal antibodies against TGEV membrane protein do not completely neutralise virus infection (Sanchez et al., 1990, Risco et al., 1995). We assume that the presence of an additional membrane domain in CCoV-BGF, predicted by TMHMM (Fig. 3A), could be helping the virus to avoid degradation by host proteases (Armstrong et al., 1984) and therefore to evade the T-cell response.",
