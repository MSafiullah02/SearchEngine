These genes are critical for resistance and susceptibility to diseases, and host-pathogen interactions are major determinants of their extensive polymorphism. Here we examined spatial patterns of diversity of the expressed MHC class II DRB gene of three sympatric Neotropical bats, Carollia perspicillata and Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae), and Molossus molossus (Molossidae), all of which use the same environments (e.g., forests, edge habitats, urban areas). Comparison with neutral marker (mtDNA D-loop) diversity was performed at the same time.",

The occurrence of multiple DRB loci was found for the two Phyllostomidae species. The DRB polymorphism was high in all sampling sites and different signatures of positive selection were detected depending on the environment. The patterns of DRB diversity were similar to those of neutral markers for C. perspicillata and M. molossus. In contrast, these patterns were different for D. rotundus for which a geographical structure was highlighted. A heterozygote advantage was also identified for this species. No recombination or gene conversion event was found and phylogenetic relationships showed a trans-species mode of evolution in the Phyllostomids.",

            "text": "Regarding adaptation to infectious diseases, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most commonly studied in mammals. MHC genes play a significant role in the functionality and effectiveness of the immune response of vertebrates and are directly involved in fitness and adaptation of hosts to their pathogens [1] . Therefore, studying MHC gene diversity in non-model animals, known to be reservoirs of pathogens, is a critical tool to assess its evolutionary process and implication in (1) the variation of individual fitness, (2) population viability and (3) evolutionary potential in a changing environment [2] . Studies have essentially focused on the genetic variability of exon 2 of the MHC class II DR beta (DRB) gene given that this exon encodes the peptidebinding region (PBR) [1] . Hence, most of the variability displayed is recorded on this exon. Variations within the PBR define the repertoire of antigenic determinants and subsequently the ability to recognize a variable number of circulating pathogens [3] . Optimum resistance to pathogens is, therefore, the result of all intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the genetic variability of individuals' immune system [4] . Most of the vertebrate populations studied so far exhibited high levels of MHC diversity both in the number of alleles and in their heterozygosities and allelic variation [5] [6] [7] [8] . Pathogen-driven balancing selection and sexual selection seem to play a fundamental role in the preservation of this high level of polymorphism [2] . Pathogen-driven balancing selection acts through antagonistic host-parasite coevolution via several mechanisms: overdominant and frequency-dependent selection [9] , as well as spatial and temporal variation in host pathogens [10] . Sexual selection pressures encompass mechanisms such as maternal-fetal interactions [11] and mate selection [12] . However, when assessing the genetic variability of both neutral markers and MHC genes, studies have highlighted the role of past demographic processes (e.g., fragmentation, bottlenecks, geographic isolation) in shaping the pattern of MHC variability that can sometimes surpass that of natural selection [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Indeed, differences in the diversity of pathogens (inducing different selection pressures on the hosts) are directly linked to environmental components. These latter (e.g., vegetation cover and density, landscape fragmentation, human occupation) modulate parasite and pathogen species richness, their survival and adaptability, as well as their distribution, transmission, developmental success and their ability to induce diseases [23] . Environmental components likewise impact the richness, population dynamics, immunocompetence and nutritional status of host species, all of which subsequently determine resistance or susceptibility to disease [24, 25] . A strong correlation was also shown between host and parasite species richness, their life history and ecological traits [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, anthropogenic alterations of habitats induce changes in host-pathogenenvironment interactions and are consequently linked to the emergence of infectious zoonotic diseases [29] [30] [31] . Therefore, considering the role of the environment is critical for the assessment of MHC gene variability.",

However, bats rarely exhibit clinical or pathological signs of diseases and appear to coexist with their pathogens in a disease-free state, characteristic of reservoir hosts [33] . At the order level, the monophyly of Chiroptera was evidenced via phylogenetic relationships inferred from intron sequences of DRB [34] . The monophyletic origin of DRB genes was also evidenced at the family level via phylogenetic relationships inferred from DRB sequences from Saccopteryx bilineata, Myotis spp., Noctilio spp. and Carollia perspicillata [35] . Other studies, investigating the diversity of MHC DRB, showed significant differences in the polymorphism of MHC genes between species. This polymorphism was essentially influenced by (1) a pathogen-driven selection [36] , (2) a social structure driven by MHC-mediated post-copulatory mechanisms [37] , (3) diversifying selection and recombination events [35, 38] and (4) geographical constraints resulting in spatial variation of pathogen-mediated selection and enhanced susceptibility to environmental changes [39, 40] .",

Furthermore, assuming that bats using the same roosting area and/or the same foraging areas would be subjected to similar pathogen pressures, we should observe similar trends in intra-and inter-specific MHC diversity.

All cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Roche) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Expressed MHC DRB genes of the three bat species were amplified by a minimum of two independent polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using a standard procedure with the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To optimize the detection of different alleles, a minimum of two distinct PCRs per individual were performed. Speciesspecific primers were designed for C. perspicillata and D. rotundus to avoid occurrence of non-amplifying alleles (Table 1) . To amplify the M. molossus DRB gene, primers designed by Richman et al. [39] were modified. Primers located in conserved parts of exon 1 (JSex1.5, [37] ; EX1Fd, modified from [39] ), exon 2 (JS2Cape, [37] ), exon 3 (EX3Rd, modified from [39] ) and exon 4 (L729, [50] ) were used to amplify functional MHC class II DRB alleles from the cDNA of three bats from each species, C. perspicillata, D. rotundus and M. molossus. The sequences obtained were used to design specific primers complementary to conserved parts of exon 1 (BatCMHIIF (F) and BatCMHIIF.1 (F1), Table 1 ) and exon 4 (BatCMHIIR (R) and BatCMHIIR.1 (R1), Table 1 ). The primer combinations F-R and F1-R1 were used as the first PCR for D. rotundus and C. perspicillata (Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). For the second PCR, all of the newly designed primers were used together with JSex1.5, EX1Rd, EX3Rd and L729 in different combinations to screen the cDNA of a total of 24 C. perspicillata and 39 D. rotundus (Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). Two different primer combinations with JS2Cape, EX3Rd, R and R1 were used to amplify the DRB alleles from the cDNA of 40 M. molossus (Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). The PCR products were cloned using the pCR\u21224-TOPO\u00ae TA CLONING\u00ae KIT (Invitrogen).

For this purpose, two maximum-likelihood (ML) frameworks were carried out as proposed by [68] . First, two alternative models comprised in the CodeML Program included in the PAML package version 4.7 were executed [69] . The first one (M7) allows codons to evolve either neutrally (\u03c9 = 1) or under purifying selection (\u03c9 < 1), while the second one (M8) considers a class of sites under positive selection (\u03c9 > 1). These models were compared with a likelihood ratio test (LTR; 2\u0394l = 2-l 1 -l 0 ) with two degrees of freedom (\u03b1 = 0.05) [70] . As previously described, each analysis was run twice, with starting \u03c9 values of 0.5 and 1.5, to ensure convergence [68] . The F3 \u00d7 4 model of codon frequencies was assumed for all analyses. The amino acids positively selected were identified using the Bayes empirical Bayes approach (BEB), as recommended by Yang [71] , with the cutoff posterior probability set at 90 %. Secondly, five ML methods proposed in the HyPhy package were used. For all analyses, the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was assessed with the automatic model selection tool available on the server. A single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) model was used to detect evidence of the non-neutral evolution of the DRB gene [72] . Based on ancestral reconstruction, this model counts d N and d S changes at each codon position in a phylogeny. Fixed (FEL) and random effects likelihood (REL) models were performed to estimate the \u03c9 ratio on a site-by-site basis [72] . For the FEL model, \u03c9 ratios were estimated with an a priori distribution of rates across sites, while this distribution was determined by the present data for the REL model. An internal FEL (IFEL) model was carried out to highlight selection pressure at the population level (i.e., along internal branches). Finally, a mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) was performed to highlight both diversifying and importantly episodic selection at individual sites [73] . Codon positions were regarded as candidates for positive selection if the following two a see Additional file: Figure S2 , b Primer modified from Richman et al. [39] to amplify the exon 2 of MHC class II DRB gene criteria were met: (1) p-values < 0.1 for SLAC, FEL, IFEL and MEME and (2) Bayes Factor > 50 for REL. Accordingly, only sites identified as being under positive selection by at least two approaches were considered [68] .

In addition, no loss of polymorphism induced by low host and/or pathogen diversity, expected to occur in disturbed environments [47, 48] was observed. Furthermore, mtDNA D-loop sequences, considered as neutral, revealed high levels of genetic diversity for C. perspicillata and M. molossus. High levels of neutral diversity have been associated with either multiple geographic origin and/or population admixture [81, 82] , suggesting that C. perspicillata and M. molossus populations originated from one of these two phenomena or from both.

These alleles are likely ancient and play a significant role in the immune response, conferring a selective advantage to the bats in Fig. 7 Phylogenetic relationships of the MHC class II DR beta sequences based on part of exon 2 (174 bp) with values of posterior probabilities for nodes. Species designation follows the GenBank accession numbers for previously described DRB sequences. Arja A. jamaicensis, Cape C. perspicillata, Dero D. rotundus, Momo M. molossus, Myve M. velifer, Myvi M. vivesi, Noal N. albiventris, Nole N. leporinus, Sabi S. bilineata. HLA-DRB1 was used as the outgroup. TSP indicates trans-species polymorphism of the newly described DRB alleles with previously described DRB alleles sympatry in these habitats. Indeed, given that forest environments are characterized by a high level of pathogen diversity, these alleles most likely possess enhanced recognition capabilities and might be able to recognize a broader range of pathogens. They thus allow a more efficient immune response in line with the ecological diversity. Moreover, the geographical structure highlighted in D. rotundus, using mtDNA D-loop results, did not affect the allelic distribution. Indeed, most of the alleles identified in D. rotundus were shared between sites, and one allele (Dero-DRB*19) was present at all sites. In contrast, no geographical structure was found in C. perspicillata even if the alleles identified in urban and periurban areas were rare and not shared with other groups. These results suggest that environment rather than population structure drives the allelic distribution, corroborating a local adaptation hypothesis. Although edge and forest habitats may differ in pathogenic pressures (see above), the results observed for C. perspicillata may be related to the high tolerance of this species to habitat disturbance and to its dominance in bat communities in edge habitats [45] , likely allowing continuous exposure to the communities of pathogens of both pristine and disturbed forests, and pathogen transfer between these habitats.",

Nevertheless, the heterozygote-dominant character of individuals with these alleles suggests a turnover of these loci generated by evolutionary processes such as the silencing of duplicate genes by mutation or deletion [88] . Under the birth-and-death model, genes created by duplication can be maintained for long periods, deleted or transformed as pseudogenes and, therefore, contribute to host fitness and adaptability [92] . The phenomenon is especially significant among heterozygote D. rotundus, for which one of the two alleles is among the most widespread in the population studied (Dero-DRB*02, 05 and 15), and supports a shift towards an allele with better recognition capabilities.",

In contrast, PSS not identified as human ABS might play a role in MHC DRB recognition capability or in the molecule stability for the species studied. Here, nine of the PSS were detected in C. perspicillata, while only one was detected in both D. rotundus and M. molossus. Therefore, the observed excess of d N in C. perspicillata was attributed to PSS identified as non-ABS in humans. This result demonstrates the critical role of positive selection in shaping MHC diversity and corroborates that positive selection is driven by a species-specific immune response. Focusing on C. perspicillata, comparisons of PSS identified here with those previously described revealed high congruence, even among PSS not identified as human ABS [35] . A similar result was observed between C. perspicillata and A. jamaicensis, two Phyllostomidae with the same diet [38] . Taken together, these findings reveal family and species-specific selection pressures acting on MHC genes. Moreover, the high similarity of PSS between A. jamaicensis and C. perspicillata highlights that bat species sharing similar feeding strategies might be subjectedindependently of their habitatsto similar pathogenic pressures, mainly from their microbiota [94] . Comparisons between each environment subgroup, for each present case, revealed the existence of private PSS depending on the area, suggesting a habitat-specific selection pressure process. Indeed, while six private PSS were counted in urban and periurban areas for C. perspicillata, only two were detected in edge habitats and one in pristine forest.",

Evidence of trans-species polymorphism in bats was reported in both Myotis spp. and Noctilio spp. [35] and at the family level between the two phyllostomids A. jamaicensis and C. perspicillata [38] . Phylogenetic analyses in our study did not reveal any characteristic clustering of MHC alleles depending on the habitat, but rather clades at the family, genus and species levels (Fig. 3) . These results suggest either similar pathogenic pressures or that these alleles possess a larger antigenic recognition capability that constitutes a major asset to the immune response of these species. Intermingled clusterings observed in this survey (between DRB sequences from A. jamaicensis, C. perspicillata and D. rotundus) are in agreement with trans-species polymorphism reported in bats [35, 38] . The observed trans-species polymorphism for Myotis spp. [35] was not detected in the present study. The results highlighted clustering between S. bilineata and M. velifer. However, this clustering was no longer observed by analyzing full-length exon 2. Observation of trans-species polymorphism within bat families (e.g., Phyllostomidae) strengthens the scenario of independent modes of evolution of MHC DRB alleles, allowing balancing selection to retain substantial allelic lineages before speciation events [95, 96] . Extended periods of host-pathogen coevolution is thought to contribute to trans-species polymorphism given that host-sharing pathogens and exposure to similar pathogen pressures are believed to induce similar changes in different host species [97] .",

Evolutionary analyses of MHC DRB alleles for the three species did not reveal any area-dependent clustering effect. Furthermore, analyses of partial sequences of the mtDNA D-loop revealed no structuration for C. perspicillata and M. molossus, whereas it was observed for D. rotundus. Demographic analysis performed for the three species did not detect any substantial bottleneck or expansion. While the patterns observed for the first two species corroborate the hypothesis of a similarity between the intrinsic genetic diversity of the species and that of MHC, the lack of similarity between these patterns of diversity for D. rotundus contradicts this statement. These results suggest that the signature of an area-limited pathogen-driven selection, supported by the presence of private PSS rather than by demographic processes such as distance isolation, is observed in this case.",

Our results revealed a high genetic variability in the MHC DRB gene. Natural selection, as well as local adaptation driven by different parasite and pathogen exposures across environments, contribute to the maintenance of an extensive MHC polymorphism. The richness of pathogens in the different habitats should be investigated to strengthen our assumptions on potential local adaptation. Further studies using finer neutral markers such as microsatellites will be necessary to detect possible confounding effects, such as hidden structuring and demographic history, and thus to better understand the drivers of MHC allelic diversity.",
