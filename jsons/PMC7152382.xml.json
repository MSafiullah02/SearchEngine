Efficient diffusion of gases between the air and blood is dependent on the thin aqueous/lipid lining layer and the cellular compartments (epithelial, interstitial, and endothelial). Capillaries are located in the interalveolar septum that bridges different alveolar surfaces.3 On the air side, the alveolus is lined by two morphologically distinct epithelial cells, TI and alveolar type II (TII) cells. The morphologic and morphometric characteristics of both TI and TII cells are remarkably constant over an approximately 10,000-fold range in mammalian lung size,4 from which one may infer that there is a conservation of functions of both cell types. Although the distinctive anatomic features of alveolar cells permit the efficient diffusion of gases by forming a thin cellular barrier, alveolar epithelial cells have also evolved to perform other necessary functions, including producing pulmonary surfactant, maintaining an optimal alveolar liquid layer by regulating ion and water transport, protecting against inhaled toxins and infecting agents, and repairing the alveolar epithelium following lung injury or inflammation.4, 5\n",

Without surfactant, the work of breathing increases markedly and respiratory distress develops rapidly. In the absence of surfactant the work of breathing may increase from less than 2% to more than 10% of total oxygen consumption. Surfactant provides the low surface tension at the air-liquid interface that is necessary to prevent atelectasis, alveolar flooding, and severe hypoxia. A complex but highly regulated process has evolved for the synthesis, secretion, and reutilization of surface-active material. In addition to its well-recognized property of providing alveolar stability, surfactant is also important for maintaining the patency of small airways and preventing alveolar flooding.",

The tight junction is composed of a dynamic complex of proteins that include transmembrane proteins, cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins, signaling proteins, and adaptors that link to the cytoskeleton. Claudins play key roles in forming tight junction strands and determining paracellular permeability.12 Permeability can be further modulated by various other factors, including Rho-associated protein kinase, protein kinase C, and other kinases, as well as various cytokines, growth factors, and hormones.13\n",

Both TI and TII cells express primarily three claudins (claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-18.1).22, 23 Claudin-3 is associated with decreased barrier function, whereas claudins 4 and 18 are associated with increased barrier function. The proportion of each claudin is different between the two cell types.12 In TI cells, the lung-specific claudin-18.1 constitutes more than 50% of claudin mRNA, whereas in TII cells, claudin-3 is the dominant claudin. Because TII cells contain approximately 20-fold more claudin-3 protein than do TI cells, it has been suggested that claudin-3 is localized mainly to TI-TII cell junctions and that TI-TII and TI-TI cell junctions may have different paracellular permeability characteristics; for example, it has been proposed that TI-TII cell junctions are more permeable than the TI-TI cell junctions that constitute the majority of the alveolar epithelial surface.12, 22 There may be other differences between TI-TI and TI-TII junctions. For example, in models of lung injury, neutrophils appear to migrate across the epithelial barrier selectively between TI and TII cells, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this apparent selectivity are unknown.24, 25\n",

Studies of clearance of exogenously added lung liquid demonstrate rapid clearance of liquid from the alveolar space, suggesting that clearance is mediated by Na+ channels with a high conductance and/or large numbers of channels with a lower conductance. Ions are transported actively, with water following passively. The osmotic water permeability of TI cells is one of the highest found in mammalian cell membranes, suggesting that TI cells play a major role in passive water transport.26 Presumably aquaporin 5, which is localized in the apical plasma membrane of TI cells,27 is responsible for the high osmotic water permeability; the molecular basis for water transport across the basal surface remains unknown.14 TI and TII cells also differ in the content of certain ion channels. Studies with either freshly isolated TI and TII cells28 or TII cells cultured under special conditions29 demonstrated that both cell types contain high-conductance sodium channels. TI cells, unlike TII cells, contain cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels and K+ channels, and TII cells contain more cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) than do TI cells per unit area.28 By immunohistochemical methods and Western blotting, TI cells contain the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and various subunits of the Na+-, K+-ATPase.30 In addition to high-conductance sodium channels, both cell types contain less selective Na+ channels, although these are far less abundant.28 In most species, less than half of fluid transport in the lung is inhibitable by amiloride31, 32; thus, it has been postulated that the amiloride-insensitive CNG channels are responsible for the bulk of transport. The importance of amiloride-insensitive sodium transport was recently reviewed by O'Brodovich and associates.33 Although patch clamping data are consistent with the presence of CNG channels in TI cells but not TII cells, the presence of CNG channels in TII cells cannot be definitively excluded.",

Recent studies of TI cells injured in vitro have confirmed that membrane repair by lipid recruitment is facilitated by the caveolar endocytic pathway and by the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton close to the site of wounding.44, 45\n",

Macklin before the advent of electron microscopy.50 Many of his initial predictions about the function of these cells have been verified over the past 60 years. In electron micrographs, TII cells are readily identified by the presence of lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage form of pulmonary surfactant (Fig. 8-3\n). The major functions of TII cells include: producing pulmonary surfactant, serving as the progenitor cells for maintaining the alveolar epithelium under normal circumstances and after mild injury, transporting fluid to keep the alveoli from flooding, and playing an important role in innate immunity. The high density of mitochondria and high glucose and oxygen consumption indicate that TII cells are highly metabolic. Because TII cells are the only source of surfactant, which is rich in phospholipids, lipid metabolism of the TII cells has been studied extensively.51 TII cells are highly enriched in genes involved in lipid synthesis.52, 53 For example, TII cells can be identified in the lung by expression of two enzymes of lipid metabolism, fatty acid synthase and stearoyl CoA desaturase-1, as well as by expression of the traditional markers such as surfactant protein (SP) C.52 Lipogenesis is upregulated at the end of gestation and is regulated by the transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha, similar to other lipogenic cells.52, 54 TII cells also are unique in expression of one of the surfactant proteins, SP-C, and the promoter for SP-C has been extremely useful for expressing or deleting genes in murine TII cells. However, while the TII cells express other surfactant proteins, SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D, these proteins are also expressed in nonciliated bronchiolar cells (club cells [Clara]) and at low levels in some extrapulmonary issues.55, 56\n",

These TII cells become a transit-amplifying population.57 The initial studies to demonstrate this relationship used oxidant injuries in rodents to identify the proliferating cells with titrated thymidine.58, 59, 60, 61, 62 In these studies, there was an initial labeling of TII cells and, with time, the labeled cells differentiated into TI cells. More recently, the ability of TII cells to proliferate and transdifferentiate into TI cells was documented by lineage tracing techniques in mouse lung.46 This recent report demonstrated that TII cells are the source of new TI cells and TII cells under normal conditions and under conditions of mild injury. Hence, TII cells can serve as a transient proliferating cell population to maintain the alveolar epithelium under normal circumstances. However, in response to severe injury such as after influenza or toxins specific to TII cells, other epithelial cells from the bronchioalveolar junction or terminal airways that express keratin V, \u03b16/\u03b24 integrin, or club cell secretory protein (Clara), can proliferate, migrate, and, in some circumstances, express SP-C.63 These additional pathways have been reported in mice and, although they are not fully defined, may be important in ARDS. Although the precise regulation of the transition of the TII cell to TI cell phenotype is not known, bone morphogenic protein 2 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 1 (TGF-\u03b21) have been suggested as regulators of the TII cell to TI cell transdifferentiation in vitro.64 Keratinocyte growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor are also important mitogens for TII cells in vivo and in vitro.65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 71a\n",

Alveolar TII cells are part of the first responders when microbes and other toxic agents enter the alveolus. Surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) are important components of the innate immune system and are discussed in detail later in this chapter. SP-A and SP-D are multivalent lectins (i.e., proteins that bind to carbohydrates and can play numerous roles in biologic recognition). Indeed, SP-A and SP-D can bind to a variety of viruses, bacteria, and fungi. However, TII cells can also be the target of specific respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV and influenza.74, 75 For example, if influenza is instilled into excised human lung, it mainly infects TII cells and does not infect TI cells.76 In response to viral infection, TII cells secrete a variety of cytokines to activate macrophages, recruit monocytes, and trigger the adaptive immune system.75 The dominant interferon produced by TII cells is interferon-\u03bb (IL29), a type III interferon. The overall magnitude of the cytokine response is robust and similar to the response in alveolar macrophages. The major cytokines produced in response to influenza include CXCL10, IL6, RANTES, and IL29.75 Microbes can be recognized by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). At the mRNA level, human TII cells have significant expression of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR5 but low expression of TLR4 and TLR7, similar to that in bronchial epithelial cells.75 TII cells can also respond to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).77\n",

In interstitial lung disease, TII cell hyperplasia is a common pathologic feature. One of the current hypotheses on the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is that the fibrotic response is caused by TII cell dysfunction due to protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which ultimately leads to secretion of TGF-\u03b2 and other profibrogenic factors.80, 81 Although some have considered an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to be an important part of the fibrotic response, this is unlikely to be important on the basis of recent lineage tracing studies.47 Mutations of SP-A and SP-C are thought to cause some types of familial pulmonary fibrosis, and this is thought to be due to protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticular stress.82, 83, 84, 85, 86 Potentially more will be learned about the role of TII cells in interstitial lung disease when these cells are isolated from diseased lung. Finally, TII cells can be a source of adenocarcinomas.87 Bronchioalveolar carcinomas and some adenocarcinomas likely arise in TII cells. Surfactant proteins and the transcription factor TTF1 have been used to differentiate lung adenocarcinomas from extrapulmonary sources and the presence of micrometastases in regional lung nodes in staging adenocarcinomas. In the mouse, urethane adenomas all express SP-C, which indicates that they are of TII cell origin88 and adenocarcinomas induced by KRAS mutations are also of TII cell origin.89\n",

            "text": "The discovery of pulmonary surfactant came from direct physiologic observation and an understanding of the Laplace relationship for calculating surface tension. In 1929, von Neergaard90 discovered that there was a difference in the elastic recoil properties of the lung depending on whether the lung was inflated with air or saline so that it took more pressure to inflate a lung with air than with saline (Fig. 8-4\n). Even though it takes more pressure to inflate the lungs with air than with saline, von Neergaard90 calculated that the pressure needed to inflate the lungs with air was much less than expected at low lung volumes. From these observations, von Neergaard deduced that the surface tension in the lung was low.90 By studying extracts of lung, Clements and Pattle91, 92 independently demonstrated that surfactant, specifically the phospholipids of surfactant, was responsible for lowering the surface tension. The low surface tension, produced by pulmonary surfactant, markedly decreases the work of breathing, prevents alveolar collapse and atelectasis, allows for alveoli of different size (radius of curvature) to be stable, and prevents alveolar flooding. Soon after these discoveries, Avery and Mead demonstrated that a deficiency in surface-active material caused NRDS.93 The critical component of surfactant that provides the low surface tension is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This is an unusual species of phosphatidylcholine in that both fatty acids are saturated. DPPC molecules can pack closely together and allow the surface monolayer to withstand the high film pressures required to produce a low surface tension at low lung volumes.93a\n",

Compression of the surface balance reduces the area of the surface film similar to exhalation. Surfactant produces a stable film and is able to withstand high film pressures without collapsing. During inflation, surfactant must be absorbed into the surface. During deflation, as the surface area decreases, the film pressure rises and the surface tension falls. Phospholipid molecules already present in the air-liquid interface get packed closely together. High film pressures squeeze some components of the film, such as unsaturated phospholipids and the surfactant proteins, out of the monolayer. The surface film generated at low lung volumes is thought to be composed of nearly pure (95%) DPPC.94 Epifluorescence studies with hydrophilic markers have shown that, as the film is compressed, there are areas from which aqueous markers are excluded. Fixation of the lung with osmium vapors has shown that some of the alveolar surface is covered with multilayers of phospholipids, which serve as a reservoir of surfactant to enter the film at high lung volumes. The surfactant system provides a low surface tension in the alveoli and small airways but not in the large airways or trachea.95, 96\n",

From in vitro studies on film formation, it is clear that SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C can increase the rate of delivery of phospholipids to the air-liquid interface; by itself, DPPC has an extremely low rate of adsorption to the surface. In addition, SP-A and SP-B were found to be necessary for the formation of tubular myelin (Fig. 8-5\n).97 Tubular myelin is a unique extracellular form of surfactant, in which an organized lattice of surfactant bilayers is formed. These bilayers appear to form at right angles in both transmission electron micrographs and freeze fracture images.11 Tubular myelin is the form of surfactant intermediate between the lamellar body, which is secreted, and the surface monolayer. Tubular myelin is a major component of large-aggregate surfactant, the form that sediments rapidly on centrifugation and is surface active. However, because SP-A\u2013deficient mice lack tubular myelin and have normal respiratory mechanics, the formation of tubular myelin is not absolutely necessary for surfactant function.98\n",

The overall organizational structure of SP-A is similar to serum mannose-binding lectin and the complement component C1q. These molecules form a polarized bouquet-like structure composed of 18 monomers that are organized as six trimeric units. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) is critical for most SP-A functions and consists of a globular domain that binds carbohydrate and other ligands recognized by SP-A. The structure of the CRD is highly conserved in this class of calcium-dependent lectins. The macromolecular structure of SP-A is 20 nm from the N-terminal to the C-terminal CRD unit and across the array of CRD units. The crystal structure has revealed a hydrophobic binding pocket in the CRD that likely accounts for the lipid binding properties of SP-A.112\n",

This is sometimes referred to as the inflammatory paradox of SP-A. Gardai and colleagues129 formulated an interesting mechanism for these observations. In the normal setting, SP-A interacts with macrophages via its CRD domain and binds to signal-inhibitory regulatory protein \u03b1, which suppresses cytokine production. However, during infection, SP-A binds the invading organism with its CRD domain and instead interacts with macrophages via its N-terminal domain and binds to the calreticulin/CD91 complex to stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines. Hence, SP-A can both stimulate and inhibit inflammatory cytokine production in vitro. It is important to recall that in vivo there is a complex interaction among SP-A, the phospholipids of surfactant, inhaled microbes, and receptors on inflammatory cells. Each has a different binding affinity for SP-A and independent regulation. Finally, SP-A has also been shown to bind to apoptotic cells and increase their uptake and removal by macrophages,125 although SP-A appears to be less important than SP-D in the clearance of apoptotic cells in vivo (see Chapter 12).",

However, the precise physiologic function of this protein is not completely understood. The fully processed form of SP-C is a 35\u2013amino acid lipopeptide that has two palmitates attached as thioesters at amino acids C5 and C6. The segment between residues 13 and 28 forms a hydrophobic \u03b1-helix containing aliphatic amino acids, mainly valine. This \u03b1-helix is the membrane-spanning portion of SP-C and is extremely stable. In most species, there are two positively charged amino acids, lysine at position 11 and arginine at position 12, which appear to be necessary to move the protein from the ER into the Golgi network, where it is palmitoylated. The precise orientation of the palmitates relative to the valine-rich \u03b1-helix is not fully resolved, but both regions are probably important for interactions with phospholipid bilayers or monolayers. SP-C can mix with phospholipids and promote spreading and fusion of phospholipids. SP-C inserts into the monolayer and is squeezed out of the surface monolayer only at relatively high film pressures (>55 mN/m). Presumably, SP-C is important in organizing the phospholipids during the respiratory cycle. SP-C is thought to stabilize the surface film and minimize film collapse. Unlike SP-B, SP-C does not appear to interact with SP-A and is not critical for the formation of tubular myelin. SP-C is found in all preparations of natural surfactant, and a recombinant form of SP-C is used in one type of surfactant replacement therapy.",

Serum SP-D is increased in interstitial lung diseases and may predict outcome in lung transplant recipients.156 In humans, the gene for SP-D is located near the locus of SP-A on chromosome 10. SP-D is a collagenous glycoprotein with a complex but highly ordered tertiary structure (see Fig. 8-6). The primary structure consists of four domains. The N-terminal segment contains cysteines that form interchain disulfide bonds that cross-link subunits to form covalent oligomeric structures. The adjacent collagen-like region promotes the formation of noncovalent trimers, imparts a rigid longitudinal structure to the molecules, and organizes the spatial distribution of the C-terminal CRDs. The coiled-coil motif of the neck contributes to the spatial organization of the CRD domains. The C-terminal CRD domain contains the calcium and carbohydrate binding sites. The crystal structure of the CRD and neck region of SP-D has shown a distinct spatial distribution of the three CRDs, has defined the carbohydrate binding pocket, and has allowed for computer docking studies to demonstrate the importance of specific vinyl hydroxyl groups in sugars for binding.157, 158 Identical monomers of SP-D assemble as trimers and then combine to form the final dodecamer, a large symmetric cruciform-shaped molecule with a distance of about 100 nm between the terminal CRDs, about five times larger than SP-A. The CRD unit is primarily responsible for the multivalent binding to surface ligands on microorganisms. As in the case of SP-A, the full oligomerization of SP-D appears to play an important role in maintaining biologic potency that may result from specific spatial cross-linking of ligands, as well as amplification of relatively weak interactions through multiple binding sites.",

SP-D binds the phospholipids of surface-active material weakly and is mostly soluble in alveolar fluid. However, SP-D does bind two lipids with carbohydrate motifs, phosphatidylinositol and glucosylceramide, but not phosphatidylcholine. The location of SP-D in the lung also suggests that it is not directly involved with the surfactant system. SP-D is found in ER of TII cells and in the secretory granules of club cells or nonciliated bronchiolar cells but not in lamellar bodies of TII cells or in tubular myelin. SP-D is highly expressed in the hyperplastic TII cells present in interstitial lung diseases. Like SP-A, SP-D is highly expressed in conducting airways of rodents but sparsely in the major conducting airways in humans. SP-D is also present on many other mucosal surfaces.56, 159\n",

The binding of SP-D to organisms can be altered by physiologic glucose concentrations, and impaired binding in the presence of glucose may be important in diabetics.161 SP-D binds influenza A, inhibits hemagglutination, and inhibits infection.162, 163, 163a, 163b It is interesting to note that the annual severity of influenza infections is related to the ability of SP-D to bind to the circulating strains of influenza.163, 164 Strains with less SP-D binding such as the 1918 H1N1 strain and the pandemic 2009 strain are clinically more virulent. Although studies on the interaction of SP-D with viruses have been reported for only a few viruses, it is likely that SP-D binds to many respiratory viruses. SP-D also binds to bacteria and should be considered an important molecule in host defense. SP-D binds both major components of gram-positive cell walls, peptidoglycan, and lipoteichoic acid.154, 165 SP-D also binds to LPS and gram-negative bacteria with the rough form of LPS and aggregates these bacteria. SP-D also is likely important in defense against fungal infections. SP-D binds to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and histoplasma and enhances their phagocytosis and killing. SP-D also binds to and agglutinates Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the cell wall ligand for binding is \u03b2 (1\u21926) glucan.166 This binding is inhibited by pustulan, an extremely effective competitive inhibitor of SP-D. SP-D also binds Alternaria, a common mold and aeroallergen, and SP-D may be important in clearing a variety of inhaled fungal spores. Finally, SP-D agglutinates Mycobacterium tuberculosis but inhibits its phagocytosis by human macrophages. Once in macrophages, SP-D promotes phagosome-lysosome fusion and thereby intracellular killing of mycobacteria.167\n",

In vivo secretion is stimulated by hyperventilation or even a single deep breath or sigh. Stretch is an important physiologic stimulation, which signals exocytosis through an elevation of intracellular calcium that may in part be stimulated by waves of calcium increases in neighboring cells transmitted through gap junctions.12, 177 In vitro, tetradecanoyl acetate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) greatly stimulate basal secretion. Agents that stimulate secretion via cyclic AMP\u2013dependent pathways such as \u03b2-agonists and cholera toxin stimulate secretion more modestly.

The initial change is the conversion from the multilamellar state to tubular myelin (see Fig. 8-7). This requires SP-A, SP-B, and calcium and can be reproduced in vitro.97 In lavage samples, large aggregate (LA) surfactant can be isolated by differential centrifugation. These aggregates contain SP-A and SP-B and are composed of tubular myelin, multilamellar structures, and other loose lipid arrays, which are the expected forms of secreted and unraveling lamellar bodies. LA adsorbs rapidly to the air-liquid interface and can be considered an extracellular reservoir of surfactant. LA can be converted into smaller aggregates (SAs), which are much less surface active. These SAs are thought to represent surfactant that has left the air-liquid interface and are available to be taken up by TII cells and reprocessed. The two dominant routes for the catabolism of surface-active material are uptake by TII cells and catabolism by alveolar macrophages.174 The current estimates are that about 85% of secreted surfactant is recycled by adult TII cells and about 15% is catabolized by macrophages.178, 179 Relatively little pulmonary surfactant goes up the mucociliary escalator, and very little enters the bloodstream or lymphatics. Catabolism of extracellular surface-active material is regulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and its ability to activate macrophages.180 The autoimmune alveolar proteinosis syndrome is caused by an autoantibody to GM-CSF181, 182; some pediatric forms of alveolar proteinosis are due to mutations in the receptor for GM-CSF.183, 184 The extracellular pool of surfactant appears to be regulated predominately by alveolar macrophages. Deficiency in macrophages or inhibition of their state of activation impairs surfactant clearance and leads to the accumulation of surfactant in the alveolar spaces (see Chapter 70 for additional details).",

Several large clinical trials demonstrated significant improvement in gas exchange, decreased barotrauma, and decreased infant mortality in response to this therapy. Results of these trials have also shown that surfactant administered prophylactically (i.e., before the first breath) is superior to surfactant given after a period of ventilation. These differences were particularly notable in the infants of very low birth weight (<28 weeks of gestational age) and thus, prophylactic treatment is reserved for infants in this group. Otherwise, surfactant should be administered once the diagnosis of NRDS is established, usually within 30 minutes after birth. The usual dose of surfactant administered to these infants is approximately 100 mg phospholipid/kg body weight. Although surfactant therapy is effective for NRDS, approximately 30% of affected infants do not respond to this therapy.",

Regardless of gestational age, affected patients develop respiratory distress in the first few days of life that is refractory to all therapy, including surfactant supplementation. These infants usually die in the first few months of life, unless they receive a lung transplant. Although the most common abnormality involves a 1-bp deletion and 3-bp insertion in codon 121 in exon 4, which results in a premature stop codon, other mutations can also lead to respiratory failure. The heterozygotes, representing about 1 in 3000 individuals in the general population, would be predicted to have about half the SP-B level and might be more susceptible to ARDS. In mice about 20% of wild-type SP-B is required for normal ventilatory function, but more than 50% of SP-B may be necessary to protect against susceptibility to acute lung injury. NRDS also results from other deficiencies in surfactant synthesis and assembly.

The clinical criteria used to diagnose ARDS, including severe hypoxemia, decreased lung compliance, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, are also similar to those used to diagnose NRDS. As opposed to a primary deficiency of surfactant, however, ARDS is much more complex, with many different etiologies and an inflammatory cascade resulting in lung injury and alveolar edema.

BAL samples isolated from patients with severe ARDS also show a decrease in LA surfactant and an increase in poorly surface-active SA. In animal models of acute lung injury, there is a severe reduction of surfactant protein gene expression at the onset of respiratory insufficiency.205 With increased alveolar permeability in patients with ARDS, a number of proteins enter the air space and bind surfactant phospholipids and proteins or directly compete with surfactant molecules for space at the air-liquid interface. Interestingly, this nonstoichiometric inhibition of surfactant by plasma proteins can be overcome in vitro by increasing the concentration of surfactant. This observation provides rationale for administering large doses of exogenous surfactant to patients with ARDS. Thrombogenic components leaking into the airspace can also coagulate and incorporate surfactant phospholipids into fibrin clots, thereby rendering the surfactant inaccessible to the air-liquid interface. Surfactant inactivation has also been described due to an increase in the neutral lipids, primarily cholesterol. Another mechanism contributing to surfactant dysfunction in ARDS involves the increased conversion of LA into SA. In vivo studies have shown that increased tidal volumes, but not respiratory rates or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, correlated with an increased conversion of LA into SA206 and with physiologic deterioration. Minimizing these phasic changes in surface area by means of smaller tidal volumes allows surfactant to be maintained in LA forms and results in improved physiologic outcomes.206 These findings are supported by clinical trials demonstrating improved patient outcomes when lower tidal volumes are used in treating patients with ARDS.207, 208\n",

The descending limb of the air volume-pressure curve is very reproducible and is used to estimate the surface tension of the lung and static compliance.",

The amino-terminal region contains cysteines for intermolecular disulfide bonding to form covalent oligomeric units. The collagen-like domain imparts structural rigidity and elongated molecular structure to both proteins. In SP-A, the collagen region has a kink, which accounts for the bend in the collagen region and the bouquet-like structure of the octadecamer. In SP-D, the collagen domain is straight and allows formation of a cross-shaped dodecamer. The neck contributes to the trimeric assembly of polypeptide subunits and spacing for the terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The CRD is a globular region of the molecule that plays a major role in the recognition of multiple ligands. In SP-A, the CRD accounts for most of the binding to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles, TII cells, macrophages, and inhaled organisms. In SP-D, the CRD unit is responsible for all the reported interactions with viruses and bacteria.",

They are transported to the multivesicular bodies (MVB) (2), where the first lamellae are formed. These lamellae increase to form lamellar bodies (LB), which are subsequently secreted by exocytosis (3). The secreted lamellar body unfolds to form tubular myelin (TM) (4) and other large aggregates (LA). These forms adsorb into the expanded surface monolayer (5). This is a critical step for producing a low surface tension in the alveolus. During the respiratory cycle, as the film is compressed during exhalation, the film pressure rises, and a compressed, closely packed monolayer of nearly pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is formed (6). Material is excluded from the monolayer (7) and forms small aggregates (SA). Some of these aggregates are ingested by macrophages (8), but most are endocytosed for reprocessing by alveolar type II cells (9 and 10).",
