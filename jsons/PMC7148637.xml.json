Rotavirus infection has its biggest health impact on children under the age of 3 years, in whom it still accounts for approximately 200,000 deaths annually, almost entirely in less-developed countries [2]. RVs can infect many cells of the nonimmune host, but the overwhelming bulk of viral replication occurs in the mature villus tip cells of the small intestine [3]. In this review, we focus on the regulation of rotavirus replication by the host innate immune system, the host-restricted nature of the innate immune response to specific rotavirus strains, and the practical utility of these host range barriers in the development of safe and effective RV vaccines.",

            "text": "Infection with RV results in the immediate activation of a conserved cellular innate immune signaling pathway that involves multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognizing discrete RV-encoded pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A primary purpose of this diverse host-signaling system is to induce different types of interferons (IFNs) and a set of virus-induced stress genes (vISGs) through two principal transcriptional factors: nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [4], [5]. The induced IFNs and vISGs then function to restrict RV replication and pathogen-induced cell injury [6]. Of note, RVs, like virtually all other viral pathogens, have evolved a set of countermeasures to inhibit the host innate immune response, and these countermeasures are most pronounced during homologous RV infection (RV infection with a strain routinely isolated from that specific host species) [7]. Interestingly, RV strains that differ in their ability to regulate the secretion of IFNs similarly induce this early recognition pathway, as indicated by the transcriptional upregulation of IFNs and several vISGs [8]. Based on the collective evidence, initial RV transcription engages the two related PRRs RIG-I and MDA-5 (members of the family of RIG-I-like receptors, or RLRs) [8], [9], which then trigger activation of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). These receptors are likely to be stimulated by early RV transcriptional by-products such as exposed 5\u2032-phosphate groups, incompletely methylated 5\u2032-cap structures, and local dsRNA structures such as panhandle loops in viral transcripts [10]. In addition to inducing the secretion of different IFNs, RLR responses to RV are likely to orchestrate other host responses. Rotavirus activation of MDA-5 results in apoptosis, which occurs mostly in the pancreas of RV-infected mice, indicating that such PRR-dependent consequences can occur in a cell or organ type-specific fashion [11] (Chapter 6: Innate Immunity at Mucosal Surfaces).",

Among these is a third member of the RLR family: LGP2, which seems to exert a proviral effect on RV replication [9] and whose activation during RV infection may represent a viral strategy to dampen this pathway. Yet another player in the innate recognition of RV is the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, which is essential for RV-infected cells to secrete IFN [8]. The molecular basis for PKR\u2019s role during RV infection is not well understood, but given the importance of PKR in antiviral signaling in general and its inhibition by a majority of viruses, PKR is likely to be important for RV pathogenicity.",

This aspect of innate RV recognition possibly reflects the RV entry process that exploits endosomal vesicle transport to gain access into host cells. So far, TLR3, TLR7, TLR2, and TLR5 have all been implicated as potential players in the innate RV detection cascade [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The ability of TLR3 to recognize and regulate RV and thus perpetuate an antiviral effect has been tied to TLR3\u2019s age-dependent expression in the intestine [18]. Since RV typically causes severe disease and replicates in the intestine of infants and young children (in many mammalian species), coincidental with lower levels of TLR3 expression in infants [18], one possible implication is that age-restricted RV intestinal replication is partly due to enhanced TLR3 signaling with age in this mucosal compartment.",

            "text": "Other TLRs play specialized roles in discrete types of cells during RV infection. The RV-encoded enterotoxin NSP4 may function as a PAMP and in macrophages triggers inflammatory cytokine secretion by a TLR2-dependent pathway [14]. During RV infection in human enteroid cultures [19] and in different species of mammals [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], different types of IFNs are secreted, and as will be discuss below, antiviral actions of these IFNs are actively countered in a host-range-specific manner by pathogenic RVs. Of the IFNs, type I IFN is mostly expressed in the intestinal hematopoietic cell compartment rather than in the epithelium where RV primarily replicates [26]. Studies to date have implicated TLR-dependent signaling in dendritic cells in the type I IFN secretion process during RV infection [16], [27], [28]. Infection of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with RV, which are a major source of type I IFN secretion during viral infections, leads to endosome-dependent (and possibly TLR7-mediated) type I IFN secretion that is triggered by viral genomic dsRNA (or, potentially, a RV structural protein) [13], [16], [27], [28]. A central role for TLR-dependent defense against RV is also indicated by the finding that the absence of MyD88, an essential convergent adaptor in signaling from the different TLRs, results in increased RV infectivity, severity of diarrhea, and impaired humoral immunity [12]. In addition, RV is susceptible to the antiviral effects of TLR5, since activation of this receptor by bacterial flagellin prevents or cures RV infection by a process that involves the secretion of IL 22 [17], [29], [30].",

In addition, whether noncanonical inflammasomes operate in cell types other than myeloid cells is largely unknown. Recently, we found that oral infection of suckling mice with murine RV-induced robust activation of CASP1 in the small intestinal tissue, indicating a potential role for inflammasomes in RV pathogenesis [36]. Of note, in contrast to other NOD-like receptors, including NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRC4, and NAIPs, targeted deletion of NLRP9b in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of suckling mice led to an increase in diarrhea, RV shedding in the feces, and intraintestinal viral replication compared to wild-type pups, highlighting a crucial role of NLRP9b in controlling RV replication. Mechanistically, we found that during RV infection, DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) binds to viral RNA PAMP and interacts with NLRP9 to activate the downstream signaling pathway (Fig. 40.1\n). Furthermore, primary mouse intestinal enteroids generated from DHX9- or NLRP9-deficient mice produced less IL-18 and underwent less pyroptosis compared to wild-type enteroids upon RV infection, confirming a role for DHX9 in the activation of the NLRP9b inflammasome during RV infection [36].",

What is the physiological relevance of theses sensors in the human intestine? Addressing these fundamental issues will provide new insights into the biological functions of host innate immune recognition during acute RV infection and, more generally, in overall human enteric health and disease.

This multipronged subversion of the IFN response is accomplished primarily by the versatile RV nonstructural NSP1 protein, the product of RV gene 5 (see below). Most IFN-sensitive RV strains encode forms of NSP1 that exhibit defective IFN inhibition and therefore elicit enhanced IFN secretion [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Although such strains are still viable infectious agents, their ability to replicate is substantially hampered. In addition, IFN sensitivity of RVs encoding full-length \u201cfunctional\u201d NSP1 proteins also occurs in specific cell lines, possibly reflecting NSP1\u2019s inability to target host innate factors across different species [49].",

Multiple lines of evidence indicate important roles for IFN types I, II, and III in restricting RV replication in the gut and in cell culture [7], [26], [50], [51], [53]. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both types I and II IFNRs, the replication of several nonmurine RV strains is substantially enhanced (by four to five orders of magnitude). In suckling mice lacking the types I, II, and III IFNRs (either singly or in combination) significant enhancement of simian RV intestinal replication occurs demonstrating the sensitivity of heterologous nonmurine RVs to different IFN types in the mouse gut [7], [26], [50], [51]. In contrast, replication of the homologous murine RV is quite resistant to these IFNs (~1 log or less replication gain). The collective evidence thus highlights the important role of different types of IFNs (and their inhibition by the RV NSP1 protein) in RV pathogenicity and attenuation [7], [26], [50], [51], [53]. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying these interactions is key for rational RV strain attenuation and designing improved third-generation live attenuated RV vaccines.",

            "text": "The antiviral IFN response to RV infection follows a biphasic pattern consisting of an initial IFN induction phase followed by a ligand-mediated (and IFN receptor-relayed) amplification phase [7], [8]. As was discussed above, RVs are adept at inhibiting IFN induction and the RV NSP1 protein functions to degrade the essential factors \u03b2-TrCP and/or IRF3 during IFN induction in a RV strain-specific manner [66]. Interestingly, in spite of viral antagonism of IFN induction, infection with RV leads to the transcriptional induction and secretion of different IFN types in both cell culture and in vivo [8], [19], [26], [49], [52], [67]. At least two factors contribute to the failure of RV to completely suppress the induction of IFN secretion. First, synthesis of the IFN antagonist NSP1 occurs only after viral entry, uncoating of the virion, RV transcription, and translation. During this initial infection process, several by-products of viral transcription are generated that act as potent triggers of the IFN induction pathway [8], [10]. Second, RV entry into different types of cells may not always result in productive infection. For example, RV exposure to primary human pDCs results in two distinct populations of cells that differ in their level of viral infectivity [16]. Dendritic cells that are not productively infected nevertheless exhibit robust activation of the IFN induction response [16], [27]. Given the remarkable efficiency of IFN secretion in this cell type, they are a likely source of substantial IFN secretion from a nonepithelial cellular compartment where RV does not replicate efficiently. In suckling mice, infection with RV leads to significant induction of different types of IFNs, of which the type I IFNs are induced primarily in intestinal immune cells rather than being derived from IECs, where viral infectivity is maximal [26]. The secretion of IFNs from different cell types poses a unique challenge to successful viral propagation and spread to uninfected bystander IECs. This is because IFN binding to its cognate cell surface receptor activates a positive feedback loop that amplifies the expression of IFNs as well as more than 300 different IFN-stimulated genes [68]. This IFN release then efficiently amplifies the expression of antiviral proteins targeting a variety of viral replication steps in uninfected bystander cells. Each of the three major IFN types (I, II, and III) that are found to be induced in the intestine following RV infection is capable of mediating phosphorylation of the key convergent transcription factor STAT1 (at Y701, an event that is critical for unlocking the transcriptional program resulting in an antiviral state) (Fig. 40.3\n). Each of these IFN types is biologically relevant in the context of modulating RV infection and spread [7], [52].",

In cell culture, addition of purified exogenous IFNs after RV adsorption does not significantly hamper viral replication; instead, IFN treatment of cells prior to RV infection is required to achieve efficient RV replication restriction [69]. In the RV suckling mouse model, infection with a homologous murine RV and infection with a heterologous simian RV strain result in comparable levels of induction of different IFNs from the intestine [7], [26]. However, as was noted above, the presence of IFNs during infection has a negligible effect on murine RV replication (~1-log restriction in titer) but has a potent effect on heterologous simian RV replication (4- to 5-log restriction in titer) [26], [50]. These observations suggest that in order to replicate successfully, homologous RVs have evolved strategies to induce resistance to the actions of different secreted IFN types in cells prior to their actual infection (bystander cells). Classical reassortment genetic studies of the IFN-mediated replication phenotype of murine and simian RVs implicated a constellation of RV genes (encoding the VP3, NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 viral proteins) in determining the resistance to IFN signaling [51]. Of these, NSP1 is a necessary and the major determinant of efficient intestinal RV replication in an IFN-dependent fashion.\n",

Using single-cell analytic techniques, IFN-mediated STAT1 inhibition is found to occur within RV-infected cells. Remarkably, STAT1 responses to exogenous IFN ligand are also potently inhibited in RV uninfected bystander cells, which do not express any detectable viral antigen [67] (Fig. 40.3). Although initially described for a porcine RV strain SB1-A, this bystander inhibitory effect has now been observed in vitro with several other RV strains, albeit with lower efficiency (Sen and Greenberg, unpublished observations). The ability of RV to block IFN-dependent signaling has also been observed in vivo. Suckling mice infected with murine RV are able to significantly suppress IEC STAT1-Y701 phosphorylation and subsequent transcription that occurs in response to parenterally administered purified IFNs I or III [52]. Although IFNA4, IFNA5, and IFNA5 transcripts are induced in the intestines of murine RV-infected mice, transcriptional analysis of isolated mature villous enterocytes revealed that within this compartment (where RV replication predominantly occurs), both infected and bystander cells fail to amplify the type I IFN genes [26]. In the villous epithelium, RV bystander cells also do not express elevated levels of transcripts encoding IRF7, which is upregulated in response to stimulation of cells with secreted IFNs and is critical for the optimal expression of several antiviral genes.",

Recent findings demonstrate that at the single-cell level, RV infection results in the efficient depletion of type I, II, and III IFNRs within RV (VP6 antigen+) infected cells [52]. Such RV-mediated IFNR degradation is unlikely to be directed by secreted IFNs (i.e., by a ligand-dependent pathway) and despite prolonged infection of cells is restricted exclusively to the subset of cells expressing VP6. The depletion of IFNRs in RV-infected cells occurs from 6 to 8 hours postinfection (hpi) onwards by a lysosomal\u2013proteasomal pathway of protein degradation and is not observed in the RV (VP 6 antigen) uninfected bystander cells, which are nevertheless highly refractory to IFN-directed STAT1 activation (Fig. 40.3).

Interestingly, these findings indicate the likelihood that RV targets a common host-signaling pathway that is responsible for the expression of all three IFNRs. Continuing to unravel the mechanisms by which RV also inhibits the response to different IFNs in bystander cells is important for several reasons. First, since the level of RV replication substantially determines host pathogenicity, such information will enable more rational attenuation of homologous and heterologous RV strains and their use as candidate third-generation live vaccines. Second, for several diseases (including sepsis and systemic lupus erythematosus), an excessive IFN response is undesirable and implicated as a causative and/or exacerbation trigger of disease. In these situations, discovering novel therapeutic modalities that can dampen IFN signaling is potentially valuable.",

The IFN-mediated effects on transcription of several genes (including IRF7) require the assembly of a transcriptional complex ISGF3, which includes STAT1 and IRF9. The role of IRF7 and IRF9 degradation in IFN-dependent responses during RV infection has not yet been well studied.

The RV VP3 PDE domain functionally replaced the comparable domain in the murine coronavirus ns2 protein and inhibited RNaseL activity. A more recent study suggests that another VP3-independent, yet-to-be identified, mechanism also exists and contributes to RV inhibition of RNaseL [74].

            "text": "There are currently two time-honored and demonstrably successful approaches to developing safe and effective human viral vaccines [75]. In the first case, a wide variety of current viral vaccines rely on the parenteral administration of replication-incompetent inactivated whole virus, the parenteral administration of a viral protein(s) component, or the administration a molecularly produced virus-like particle (VLP). All of these entities are selected because immunity to the individual protein, inactivated whole virus, or VLP induces protective immunity to the host and, at the same time, is both safe and well tolerated. There are numerous highly successful examples of this category of viral vaccine (e.g., the inactivated polio vaccine, the various preparations of inactivated influenza hemagglutinin-based vaccines, the human papilloma VLP vaccine, the hepatitis B virus vaccine, and the recently licensed herpes zoster gE protein-based vaccine). In all cases, these vaccines are administered parenterally. Several are administered with adjuvants of one kind or another to enhance immune responses, and in all cases, they appear to function primarily by stimulating systemic immunity, with the primary effector function generally mediated by systemic antibodies. Of note, none of these types of vaccines are directed at a predominantly enteric pathogen, although an investigation of a potential parenterally administered norovirus VLP vaccine is currently under way [76], and there are plans to study the utility of a heat-inactivated RV virion-based vaccine in humans [77]. The greatest advantages of the inactivated/recombinant protein-based vaccines are their general safety and the fact that they can be produced even when the actual pathogen cannot be readily propagated. The general disadvantage of such vaccines is that they are almost always less effective at stimulating T-cell-based immune responses, they are not very efficient at stimulating mucosal immune responses, that highly effective mucosal immune adjuvants are not yet readily available, and in some cases, immune responses to these inactivated vaccine preparations tend to diminish over time more rapidly than do responses to several live viral vaccines. Other potential disadvantages of inactivated vaccines become apparent when the antigen or antigens required to induce protective immunity are difficult to synthesize artificially or when immunity is most potent when it is directed at multiple antigens that are correctly folded only on the actual or recombinant multiprotein viral particle. Of note, RVs have at least two separate proteins (VP4 and VP7) that are targets of protective antibodies, and VP4 is cleaved by enteric trypsin into two separate protein components: VP8* and VP5* [78]. Both VP8* and VP5* are individually targeted by protective antibody responses. VP7 is correctly folded into its proper antigenic trimeric form only within the context of the RV virion, and a similar issue likely is true for VP5*. On the other hand, the RV VP8* protein can be relatively simply and accurately synthesized in several prokaryote and eukaryote systems, and because of this feature, it is currently being examined as a potential inactivated vaccine to be administered parenterally [79] (Chapter 41: Development of Oral Rotavirus & Norovirus Vaccines).",

As with inactivated vaccines, a number of highly effective replication-competent viral vaccines are currently available (e.g., oral Sabin polio vaccine, measles vaccine, rubella vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, smallpox vaccine, live attenuated influenza vaccine, and, of course, several licensed RV vaccines, such as RotaTeq, Rotarix, and Rotavac) [75]. Most but not all of the live attenuated viral vaccines are administered by parenteral injection; however, oral polio, rotavirus, and live attenuated influenza vaccine are all administered to a mucosal surface (the GI tract and the respiratory tract, respectively). The general thinking is that live attenuated viral vaccines more closely mimic the type and level of immunity induced by natural infection than parenterally administered inactivated vaccines do. If natural infection is an effective preventative of severe secondary infection, then reproducing it without undue reactogenicity can be desirable. This feature is present when natural immunity is operative primarily at a mucosal surface, as is the case for RVs. Natural RV infection efficiently protects against severe reinfection, and for this reason, a variety of experimental and licensed live attenuated RV vaccines have been developed or proposed.",

            "text": "The key issue to overcome in developing a live viral vaccine is to discover a method that reliably attenuates viral pathogenicity while retaining the ability of the viral infection to induce protective immunity. Traditionally, such modification has been accomplished by multiple passage of virulent viral strains in cell culture with the hope that such multiple passages will lead to the acquisition of sufficient mutations in the viral genome (acquired to enhance cell culture replication) and that these cell culture adaptations will attenuate viral pathogenicity in the target host. This strategy is time honored and has been used to develop multiple vaccines (e.g., live polio, measles, mumps, rubella, yellow fever, and some RV vaccines). While this approach is frequently successful, there is no way to determine how many passages are needed to eliminate residual virulence while retaining immunogenicity, so it is often tedious and always an inexact approach. In addition, concerns about reversion to virulence are always present. That said, this approach was used successful to develop a highly effective human RV vaccine (R1, Rotarix), which consist of a single human RV strain that was repeated passed in several cell culture systems and, over the passage history, became attenuated in people [80]. While the genomic sequence of both the virulent wild-type parental Rotarix strain and the eventual vaccine strain are known, the exact genomic mutations responsible for attenuation are unclear. What has been established, however, is that, given the very substantial and decade-long safety record, this human RV vaccine strain has sufficient attenuating mutations to ensure a high degree of genetic stability in humans. Of note, the R1 Rotarix vaccine represents a single G and [P] serotype yet reliably induces protective immunity to virtually all frequently circulating human RV strains. This finding strongly supports the conclusion that serotype-specific immunity is not a major determinant of immunity to severe RV disease in humans [81].",

            "text": "The other strategy that has proven highly successful for the reproducible attenuation of the RVs used in live attenuated RV vaccines has been to take advantage of the HRR (see above) of heterologous (nonhuman origin) RVs as vaccine candidates for humans [82]. Several currently licensed RV vaccines (e.g., the R5 vaccines RotaTeq and Rotasil and the R1 vaccine Rotavac) consist of either natural or experimentally selected reassortants between animal RVs (in these cases, all bovine RVs) and human RVs. Both R5 vaccines are pentavalent constructs derived experimentally on the basis of bovine RV genomes but containing individual VP7- or VP4s-encoding genes derived from various human serotypes. RotaTeq is broadly licensed around the world, while Rotasil is currently licensed only in India [83]. Rotavac is, interestingly, a naturally occurring reassortant RV derived from a human RV and a bovine RV. It contains only a bovine VP4, with all other ten RV gene segments derived from a human RV strain. This virus was originally isolated from a neonatal nursery where asymptomatic RV infection was endemic [84]. Finally, of relevance to this review, an entirely lamb origin RV strain is currently licensed for RV prevention in China. This vaccine is also highly attenuated, presumably because of the HRR of a lamb origin RV in humans. While this vaccine seems safe, the data on its efficacy are limited [85]. The key point here is that all these animal virus origin based RV vaccines are highly attenuated in humans, and this attenuation, as was discussed above, is most likely based on their host range replication restriction in humans. This HRR is primarily due to the inability of heterologous RV to efficiently suppress the human intestinal innate immune response, primarily the human IFN response, owing to the presence of heterologous NSP1s in the vaccine candidates. The active human IFN response to these heterologous RV vaccines suppresses their replication sufficiently to restrict pathogenicity and reactogenicity but not so much that the generation of effective RV immunity is suppressed. However, in the case of the Indian Rotavac vaccine, attenuation might be based on the heterologous bovine origin VP4, which might be expected to reduce RV binding to human IECs.",
