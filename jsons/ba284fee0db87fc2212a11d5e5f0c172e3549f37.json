            "text": "The concept of influenza-like illness has widely been used in influenza surveillance globally. Influenza-like illness can be attributed to a range of respiratory viruses, including seasonal influenza A and B viruses (FLUAV and FLUBV), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV A and RSV B), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (PIVs 1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV), human adenoviruses (HAdV), and human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 (HCoV-229E and OC43) [Grondahl et al., 1999; Coiras et al., 2003; Druce et al., 2005; Pierangeli et al., 2007] . Recent advance in molecular detection techniques has facilitated the identification of several new respiratory viruses that may also cause influenza-like illness symptoms, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and novel strains of coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HKU1) [Drosten et al., 2003; Crowe, 2004; Allander et al., 2005; Fouchier et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005; Koetz et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2006] . Patients infected by these multiple viral pathogens may present with widely overlapping symptoms, which makes clinical diagnosis ambiguous and severely challenges the etiological studies [Eccles, 2005] .",

It was observed that the distribution pattern of influenza-like illness related viruses in Wuhan during May-September 2009, was similar to that observed in 2008. However, because of occurrence of the pH1N1, the circulation pattern of several viruses changed in the following months: the activities of PIV and HRV were greatly reduced compared to the non-pandemic period and the circulation of HMPV in 2009-2010 was delayed for over 3 months. Previous serologic studies have demonstrated that HMPV mainly circulated during the winter and early spring [Maggi et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003] , which supports our observation in -2009 . However, in 2009 , the HMPV epidemic season was delayed to March-June 2010. It is unclear which factor(s) have contributed to this delay, yet several factors might be accounted for the pattern-changing: weather conditions, increased hygiene measures implemented following the pandemic plan and viral interference. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it was a 2-year study and the possibility of the wider pattern in temporal dynamics which might not be reflected in the data from this timeframe could not be ruled out. Future studies in longer timeframe are necessary in order to better understand the etiologic pattern.",

            "text": "Intriguingly, the epidemiology for pH1N1 and HRV in Wuhan in September, 2009 was opposite to the pattern observed in European countries during the first part of autumn 2009 [Anestad and Nordbo, 2009;  Casalegno et al., 2009 Casalegno et al., , 2010 Linde et al., 2009] . Linde et al. reported that the pH1N1 circulation in Sweden increased after the end of the summer holiday, but after 4 weeks of increasing activity the spread suddenly declined. On the other hand, the number of samples sent for influenza testing was increasing until week 36 and HRV was responsible for the apparent increase of influenza-like illness reported in early September, which may have delayed the onset of the pH1N1 pandemic [Linde et al., 2009] . A similar pattern was also observed in France [Casalegno et al., 2010] . However, result of this study was in good agreement with an earlier report from Peru [Laguna-Torres et al., 2010] , which tended to support higher transmission potential of pH1N1 than non-pH1N1 influenza A viruses, as also reported elsewhere [Fraser et al., 2009; Munayco et al., 2009; Nishiura et al., 2009] . This phenomenon could be partially explained by higher population susceptibility to pH1N1 than non-pH1N1 virus to which the population might have acquired partial immunity in previous years via prior natural exposure with antigenically related strains and annual immunization campaigns of fraction of the high-risk population, with live attenuated vaccines [Frank and Taber, 1983; Belshe, 2004; Chowell et al., 2008] . Theoretical epidemiology suggests that in populations challenged by multiple infectious agents, the one with the highest reproduction number (fitness) will dominate the transmission dynamics [Anderson and May, 1991] . The reproduction number implicitly accounts for the intrinsic virus transmissibility and the background population immunity. The multiple respiratory virus detection platform applied in this study may be used to monitor the circulation of existing viruses in the population, and current results could serve as the baseline for the surveillance of unusual prevalence of a specific virus and the detection of further changes of viral distribution patterns. In addition, results of this study also suggest the broad diagnostic testing could be a valuable tool in understanding the epidemic situation of newly emerging viruses like pH1N1 and helping public health policy makers choose proper disease preventive measures. The first pH1N1 case in Wuhan was an imported case diagnosed on May 31, 2009, while the first domestic case was not reported from sentinel surveillance until August. As the study discovered, during the period from June to August 2009, several respiratory viruses (FLUAV, HAdV, HRV, and HCoVs) were circulating simultaneously with the early spread of pH1N1, as reported elsewhere [Casalegno et al., 2009; Munayco et al., 2009 ]. These observations indicated that some rigorous, expensive preventive measures, such as the antiviral treatment of local influenza-like illness patient, the quarantine and preventive dosing of their close contacts and the closure of schools having suspected pH1N1 patients [Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health, 2009] , had no need to be implemented immediately after the report of the first imported case, since the relatively high influenza-like illness rate was actually caused by pathogens other than the novel virus pH1N1.",

As this study was limited to the Children's Hospital of Wuhan, its results may not be representative of the entire children population. However, one advantage provided by sentinel surveillance systems is the ability to identify increasing trends in the number of patients seeking medical attention due to influenza-like illness symptoms, and identifying the viruses related to such increases requires fewer resources than a populationbased study. Future studies will be warranted to determine the etiologic agents for the over 30% of influenza-like illness cases that remain undiagnosed. Bacterial pathogens are likely responsible for some of those undiagnosed cases and will need to be further determined. Such analyses are necessary to better understand the influenza-like illness-associated pathogens in circulation in this region. The potential occurrence of false-negative results due to the variable sensitivity of the laboratory techniques and the type of biological samples cannot be completely ruled out.",

Results of this investigation provide the information on the etiology and epidemiology of influenza-like illness in Chinese children, which is useful for the guidance of pediatric clinical practice as well as public health policy.",
