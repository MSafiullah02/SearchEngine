Several decisions need to be made before, during and after the pandemic outbreak to minimize morbidity, mortality and economic losses. However, because the population that will be potentially affected by pandemic influenza is very large and diverse, different strategies, including non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions, will inevitably need to be employed in different communities.",

We illustrate a simulation model in the context of a major public university's emergency preparedness plan. The model is designed to capture system response to the policies that can be implemented by different departments of the university during the pandemic influenza. We first formulate a mathematical epidemiology model to have a better understanding of the disease dynamics in the local population. Then, we model several social distancing policies that can be implemented in the university such as suspending university operations, evacuating dorms and isolation of symptomatic cases on campus. The main objective of this paper is to assist the local policy makers and senior level university administrators with effective pandemic influenza community mitigation strategy development. We also present insights about the operational mitigation strategies on a university campus (dorm evacuations and isolation on campus) to help improve operational decision making.",

There have been a significant number of papers published in the literature to model infectious diseases including pandemic influenza. These models can be categorized as compartmental models (Rvachev and Longini, 1985; Flahault et al, 1994; Townshend and Turner, 2000; Brauer and Castillo-Chavez, 2001; Evenden et al, 2005; Chowell et al, 2006; Sertsou et al, 2006 and Feng et al, 2007) and discrete event agent-based models (Ferguson et al, 2006; Germann et al, 2006; Wu et al, 2006; Das et al, 2007; Dibble et al, 2007). These models in the literature are generally developed to estimate the spread of the diseases in the community and to evaluate specific mitigation policies.",

In a recent study, Chowell et al (2006) used data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, to present the transmission dynamics of two different waves of the disease with a compartmental model. Another compartmental model is presented by Feng et al (2007) to determine the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including quarantine and isolation, on the spread of influenza. Other studies have attempted to expand influenza models to examine the spread of the disease outside of contained communities. Flahault et al (1994) presented a model of the spread of influenza across France based on the population movements using railroad and air transportation data, and they concluded that there will not be enough time available for taking any action to prevent the global spread of influenza once an influenza pandemic is detected. Most recently, Hsieh et al (2007) examined the impact of different quarantine strategies on the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan, such as quarantine of travellers arriving to the airports and the quarantine of potentially exposed contacts of SARS patients. Their results demonstrate that compartmental models can be very beneficial for evaluating the impact of traditional intervention measures for new emerging diseases when there is uncertainty about the disease characteristics.",

            "text": "In addition to compartmental models, there have been a significant number of papers published on individual-based modelling of the disease spread. Das et al (2007) present an agent-based simulation model for the uncertain spread of pandemic influenza caused by the H5N1 virus and they evaluate mitigation strategies. Each individual is modelled as an agent and they evaluate the policies based on the total number of infected and deceased people, denied hospital admissions, denied vaccine-antiviral drugs as well as financial measures such as healthcare-related costs and lost wages. Ferguson et al (2006) presented an individual-based simulation model to evaluate several mitigation policies such as school closure, treatment of infected individuals, case isolations and household quarantine. These individual-based models are more realistic for pandemic planning. However, because of the computational resources they require for running multiple scenarios, they may not be effective in real-time decision exercising for pandemic planning. To overcome the limitations of previous models, we designed a compartmental model that generates insights about the implementation of mitigation policies in local communities and the model is also easy to use in real-time exercises for pandemic decision making. The presented model in this paper also differs from other compartmental models, because it does not model the interventions with population dynamics in one compartmental model, but rather it creates several basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (S-E-I-R) models running in parallel for different subpopulations generated by the policy implementation.",

Once university emergency response policies are implemented, individuals will be forced to have different mixing patterns and this will generate new subpopulations in the model. For example, since commuting students are not living in university dorms they are not affected by the policies related to dorm operations (dorm evacuation). However, these students are affected by the policies such as suspending university operations, closing the campus, as well as isolation of the infected individuals on campus. On the other hand, residential students are directly affected by the policies related to dorms, such as evacuating the dorms and isolation of infectious individuals on campus. University faculty and staff are also part of the plan and they are classified as either \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018non-essential\u2019 personnel (We do not present results about the faculty and staff in this paper.). Essential personnel provide necessary basic services on campus, while non-essential personnel are assumed to be evacuated with the evacuation plan. From the strategic planning viewpoint, some of the most critical questions are: (1) when to suspend the university operations, including human resource management, research activities and residential life; and (2) how to maintain academic continuity and resume university operations. Suspending university operations will cost millions of dollars in lost revenue to the university (Sadique et al, 2008). On the other hand, keeping the university open for gatherings and education will increase the disease transmissibility, increase mortality or severe medical conditions for the university population. Thus, the university policies are the regulators between the financial concerns and sustaining healthy conditions for the university population.",

On the other hand, residential students will continue having their average number of contacts in the residential halls until the dorms are evacuated. The policy of evacuating dorms has the same effect on the population, for example it restricts the average number of contacts that students have in dorms; however, student still have contacts with their households.Isolation: This policy includes developing infirmary sites on campus to isolate the infectious and symptomatic (infected) students from the healthy and asymptomatic ones and offering appropriate medical treatment.

The policy space is represented with the set \u03a0 such that \u03c0\u2208\u03a0, where \u03c0 is a specific policy that generates the flow out and flow in. Thus, flow from one subpopulation to another can be formulated with Equation (8). In addition Equation (9) formulates the flow conservation of individuals in the model:\n",

Decision makers should be informed about events around the world because the universities have high proportions of international students and faculty travelling worldwide. After making the decision to suspend university operations, the remaining issue for university decision makers is how to deal with the students who are living in the residence halls and cannot leave the university. In addition, there is a high probability that non-residential students will request medical assistance from the university health services. University health services have to direct the students and minimize the severity of the disease. According to the university preparedness plan, all well students will be housed in one location on campus to centralize essential services. In addition to managing essential services for well students who are remaining on campus, the university plan includes an action plan for treating infected students. The sick students will be transferred to a temporary infirmary established in one of the dorms. The main inspection and control locations for the students will be the triage points at certain locations on the campus. These critical decision-making processes are quantitatively analysed in the next section along with sensitivity analyses on several disease parameters.",

Because parameters are usually uncertain in the course of a pandemic, estimates from the past pandemics are commonly used for modelling the future pandemics. Thus, we perform sensitivity analysis on our disease parameters: contact rate, incubation period and infection period. In our sensitivity analysis we assume a normal distribution for each parameter with a mean value of actual parameter value used in the base runs. Our main objective is to get more information about the impacts of these parameters on the mortalities. We use the Monte Carlo sampling method (Diwekar, 2003), one of the default sampling methods in Powersim software, to sample from the distributions.

From these analysis presented in Figure 7 we can conclude that the incubation period also plays a major role on the mortalities of commuting students, since the variability on this parameter can cause a big difference in mortality values that is almost 60 people in all of the analyses, thus the uncertainty on the incubation period may have a big impact on the policies to reduce the total number of deaths in commuting students. This is because we assume exposed individuals are also infectious but asymptomatic and incubation period is the time for the people to be active in the community and spread the disease in the community.

We can see from the figure that the uncertainty related to infection period does not have as big impact on the variability of the mortalities as contact rate and incubation period have.

We run several simulations with varying the time allocated for dorm evacuation from 1 day to 7 days to see the effects of this duration on mortalities for on campus students. This analysis can also be called a sensitivity analysis for this specific exogenous parameter (duration of dorm evacuation). In Figure 9, we can see that as the time for evacuation increases, mortality in dorms also increases for both cases of dorm evacuation policy implemented either on 1 October or 15 October. We also evaluate the duration of dorm evacuations with five index cases in the dorms for both cases of having evacuation on 1 October and 15 October. The results in Figure 9 show that earlier evacuation of dorms is critical for reducing the mortality rate. In addition to that result, we can also see that the number of index cases does not significantly change the mortality rate in dorms.",

This flexibility is given to the model by differentiating the parameter, contact rate, in subpopulations based on the implementation of the policies.

Therefore, the effectiveness of agent-based models to simulate preparedness plans in support of real-time decisions with real-time inputs is limited (Bhandari et al, 2007). In addition, in agent-based models it is hard to get an insight on the mathematical structure of the disease spread and interventions, whereas in compartmental models it is easy to perform sensitivity analysis on model parameters and develop theoretical insights (Bobashev et al, 2007). Most recently, a comprehensive approach for comparing the compartmental models (differential equation-based models) with agent-based models is presented by Rahmandad and Sterman (2008), which gives an analysis on when it is appropriate to use these models in decision making for public health problems.",

Our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that some of the parameters of the influenza spread model have more impact on the outcomes of the simulations; thus, for developing the appropriate mitigation policies these policy makers should pay special attention to these parameters. We conclude that contact rate has high importance in disease spread, and disease spread can be controlled by disease mitigation policies when appropriate actions are taken at the appropriate time. Thus, the decision makers should consider minimizing the contact rate and adjust their plans when applying several mitigation policies to their communities. In addition, uncertain and uncontrollable disease parameters have significant impact on the disease spread since it is the time for the exposed people to be active in the community and spread the disease to their contacts. Thus, policy makers should be aware of this result and develop screening activities to identify exposed individuals and quarantine them to protect others susceptible in the community.",
