            "text": "Most respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses or bacteria with viruses causing the highest proportion of infections. The major causes of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV), adenovirus (AdV), and human rhinoviruses (HRV). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43, PIV4, human enterovirus (HEV) (Casas et al., 2005), human bocavirus (HBoV), parvovirus type 4 and 5, and mimivirus have recently been implicated as etiological agents of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) albeit at a lower frequency (Arden et al., 2006; Kesson, 2007; Mahony, 2008). Laboratory confirmation is required to identify aetiological agents of respiratory virus infections since viral agents cannot be differentiated on clinical features alone (Kesson, 2007). Sensitive and rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections in hospitalized children is cost-effective. It is pivotal in directing active treatment early in the course of the illness following detection, reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescription, and limiting nosocomial transmission to high-risk patients (Adcock et al., 1997; Lanata et al., 2004; Osiowy, 1998; Woo et al., 1997). In addition, assessment of the morbidity of specific etiological agents of ALRTIs identified using sensitive detection methods in hospitalized patients is important to determine agent-specific interventions such as vaccination against RSV (Lanata et al., 2004). Extensive detection of infections will also expand our knowledge of the etiology of pneumonia and assist in determining which etiological agents should be considered for vaccine development (Rudan et al., 2008). Recent developments in molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses and the discovery of new viruses have renewed the interest in respiratory virus epidemiology. However, there is still a considerable deficiency in the diagnosis of viruses which cause ALRTI (Ieven, 2007). Far too little attention has been paid to the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in Malaysia. Therefore, in this study, the goal was to detect a panel of classical and newly discovered respiratory viruses including IFV, RSV, PIV, AdV, HMPV, HRV, HEV, HCoV, and HBoV which cause ALRTI in children below 5 years of age at Hospital Serdang. Both conventional methods including direct immunofluorescence assay, cell culture and shell vial culture and molecular diagnostic techniques including multiplex PCR and sequencing were used.",

Patients with congenital or acquired immunosuppressive conditions, with conditions that posed a potential hazard in obtaining the nasopharyngeal samples (e.g. bleeding diathesis, severe respiratory compromise) as determined by the clinicians and children with incomplete data or inadequate samples were excluded from the study. All potential subjects (including careers of the patients) were briefed on the study before written informed consent was obtained by the pediatrician in-charge of the case. Approval from the following authorities was obtained prior to the start of the study: the Ministry of Heath Malaysia Research and Ethics Committee (MREC) (NMRR-09-161-638), the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UPM (UPM/FPSK/PADS/T7-MJKEtikaPer/F01 (JMPP FEP (9) 32)) and the Research Ethics Board of Hospital Serdang were obtained.

HRV, HEV, HCoVs, PIV4 and HBoV were excluded from immunological detection because of a lack of specific monoclonal antibodies. For each virus the pattern of immunofluorescent staining was specific and was used for confirmatory purposes. Eighty eight (53.9%) of the 165 NPA samples were DFA positive as follows: 67 (40.6%) for RSV, 9 (5.5%) for HMPV, 4 (2.4%) for HAdVs, 3 (1.8%) for IFV A and 6 (3.61%) for PIVs 1-3. Detection of RSV, HMPV, PIV1\u20133, IFV-A & B, HAdV in shell vial culture was attempted as the second stage of the conventional method on the remaining 76 DFA negative NPA samples. Seven additional viruses were detected and a total of 95 (57.6%) samples were virus positive by DFA followed by shell-vial culture. Therefore, this method was able to detect some viruses which were missed by DFA: 4 RSV and one case each for HAdV, HMPV and PIV2. For RSV, CPE was detected in 31 of 83 specimens representing a 37% recovery. Twenty-four samples positive for HAdVs were inoculated into HeLa and HEp-2 cell lines. Five of 24 samples (21%) showed characteristic CPE. Semi-confluent monolayers of HeLa and MRC-5 cell lines were used to isolate 26 of the 54 HRV positive samples detected using RT-PCR.",

In the presence of all primer sets in the multiplex reaction, no mispriming was observed in the positive and negative control tubes. The specificity of the MP/RT-PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Three multiplex RT-PCR (MP/RT-PCR 1\u20133) and subsequently 2 hemi-nested multiplex PCR (HNMP/PCR 1\u20132) were carried out on nucleic acids extracted from 165 clinical specimens.

Culture of blood samples from 165 patients revealed bacterial infections in only five (3%) cases including one patient with a single infection (0.6%) with \u1f00-hemolytic Streptococcus viridans. Four other samples were also virus positive and were considered to be nosocomial infections (blood cultures results were positive after 48 h) as follows: 2 RSV/Burkholderia cepacia, 1 HRV/ B. cepacia and 1HRV/ coagulase-negative staphylococcus. M. pneumonia infections were not identified in any of the 165 patients.",

Different ensitivities of the diagnostic assays, make evaluation of the exact contribution of each virus in epidemiology difficult (van den Hoogen et al., 2003). Regional determination of the epidemiology of specific viral infections will improve the treatment guidelines for doctors (Irmen and Kelleher, 2000). The main goal of the current study was to detect a broad panel of respiratory viruses associated with hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia. We report a high prevalence of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children (Allander et al., 2007; Jartti et al., 2004; Jennings et al., 2004; Richard et al., 2008). This was achieved using highly sensitive nested PCR which was applied to a broad spectrum of viruses. NPA samples from 158 (95.8%) patients were positive for single and/or multiple viruses. Single virus infections were detected in approximately two-thirds of the samples compared with almost one-third of samples which were found to contain multiple viruses. The performance of conventional diagnostic methods and molecular methods was also evaluated using the samples in this study. As reported in other studies (Coiras et al., 2004, 2003; Freymuth et al., 2006; LaSala et al., 2007; Weinberg et al., 2004) we established that molecular methods were more sensitive than conventional methods for the detection of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized with ALRTIs.",

This is consistent with a 5.3\u201313% detection rate among otherwise healthy children hospitalized with LRTIs in several other studies (Foulongne et al., 2006a; Lee et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2006). We demonstrated for the first time that HMPV could be an important cause of LRTI in children in Malaysia. The positivity rate is also comparable with a recent study of children hospitalized with ALRTI in subtropical Brazil (11.4%) (Oliveira et al., 2009). The prevalence of HBoV was between 1.5% (Bastien et al., 2006) to 19% (Allander et al., 2005b) in these children with respiratory infections. In our study, HBoV was detected for the first time in Malaysia in 6 of 165 nasopharyngel aspirates giving a prevalence of 3.6% (Etemadi et al., 2012). The detection rate was comparable to that (3.4%) reported in France (Foulongne et al., 2006b) and Sweden (3.1%) (Allander et al., 2005b) but was lower than that reported (8.0%) in Singapore (Tan et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Sensitive multiplex PCR assays give useful information about the presence of multiple pathogens and their epidemiological and clinical effects (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005). In the current study, all of the multiple infections were diagnosed exclusively using PCR, which further supports the superiority of molecular methods over conventional methods (Rovida et al., 2005; van de Pol et al., 2006). Evaluation of the relative importance of each coexisting agent may play an important role in understanding the etiopathogenesis of these viruses (Tsolia et al., 2004). Identification of all infectious agents is especially important in high-risk immonocompromised patients for appropriate antiviral therapy (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007). In this study, multiple viral infections were found in 28% of patients and were usually combinations of RSV with HAdV and/or HRV. The co-detection rate is similar to that found by Calvo (2010) (Calvo et al., 2010)(23%), Belau-Pujol (2005) (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005)(23%), Richard (2008) (Richard et al., 2008)(24.4%) and van de Pol (2006) (van de Pol et al., 2006)(35%). The relatively high coinfection rate in this study may be explained by the broad panel of viruses investigated. This supports the theory that HRV, HAdV, HCoV and HMPV are highly prevalent in multiple infections (van de Pol et al., 2006). It is surprising that a high diversity of virus combinations was found in the samples. This may be due in part to the continued presence of all of the surveyed viruses during the study period with no distinct seasonality. RSV and HAdV was the most commonly detected co-infection. The high proportion of HAdV co-infections (87.5%) with other viruses in this study is comparable with (89%) HAdV co-infection rates in a study by Calvo (2010)(Calvo et al., 2010). The second most prevalent combination was RSV and HRV (24%). This combination has been reported as the most common co-infection in other studies (Chung et al., 2007; Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008; Richard et al., 2008). The high incidence of RSV and HRV co-infection can be explained by the substantial overlapping of the monthly distribution observed for these viruses during the study period (Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008). Quantification of the viruses in the samples may help to better understand the etiological role of each virus (Rovida et al., 2005). A study of the clinical features is required to clarify the disease severity in mixed infections (Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008).",
