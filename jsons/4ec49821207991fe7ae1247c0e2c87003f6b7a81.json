Moreover, as many patients will require long duration of invasive mechanical ventilation [8] exposing them to a high risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, these patients should not be exposed to inadequate antibiotics drug dosing. However, since the prevalence of augmented renal clearance was low, the risk of \u03b2-lactam underdosage is probably low and conventional doses of \u03b2-lactams should be sufficient.
