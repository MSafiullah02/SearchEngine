Exacerbations of COPD are associated with a mortality of 10% in the hospital, 43% at 1 year and 50% in the subsequent 5 years [3\u20135]. Exacerbations themselves are associated with a step-wise decline in lung function and deteriorating quality of life [6]. The most commonly identified triggers for AECOPD are respiratory viruses, particularly rhinovirus, as well as bacterial pathogens and environmental exposures.",

NIPPV avoids many of the risks of invasive ventilation (via an endotracheal tube), including the risk of aspiration, hypotension or trauma during laryngoscopy and placement of the endotracheal tube. In addition, NIPPV preserves airway defenses, which may reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and usually does not require sedation or physical restraints.

Sputum purulence may be related to bacterial infection, but a clinical benefit from antibiotics has not been established prospectively in this group [32, 33]. Clark et al. showed that an elevated CRP did not reliably distinguish between viral and bacterial infections so is unhelpful in guiding the decision to use antibiotics [34]. Procalcitonin is a promising biomarker, which may help distinguish bacterial and viral infections [35]. Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use was associated with similar outcomes but less antibiotic exposure in AECOPD [35]. However, more recent data including patients with either pneumonia or AECOPD failed to replicate this finding [36].",

This process, initially explored for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can be part of conventional venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or arteriovenous (AV) ECMO [39]. However, more recently, lower flow circuits of only 0.3\u20131 L/min have been proposed for the purposes of CO2 removal, particularly in AECOPD to supplement NIPPV and prevent the need for endotracheal intubation [39, 40]. One retrospective analysis compared 21 patients with AECOPD who did not improve on NIPPV and were subsequently intubated with 21 patients treated with a pumpless extracorporeal lung-assist device (PECLA). No difference was noted in ICU or hospital stay, though those treated with PECLA had reduction in PCO2, improvement in pH, and required no sedation, allowing them to eat, exercise and communicate [41].",
