            "text": "With the demands of proteome analysis, high-resolution and high-throughput peptide/protein-based separation technologies are undergoing great development. As an orthogonal highly resolving separation technique, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), introduced more than a quarter century ago [1], [2] still plays a central role in many analysis of proteome samples such as cell lines, tissues or biological fluids. But the 2D-PAGE has some limitations in protein analysis for high- (>150 kDa) and low-molecular weight (<10 kDa) proteins as well as those of proteins with extreme pI values. Another limitation of 2D-PAGE is that it cannot be coupled on-line with MS to achieve a fast multi-dimensional protein separation and identification [3]. As a result, multi-dimensional liquid phase-based separation methods using different electrophoretic and chromatographic techniques have been greatly developed as complementary methodologies. The feasibility of multi-modular combinations of HPLC, isoelectric focusing (IEF), chromatofocusing (CF), capillary electrophoresis (CE) as well as combinations of different HPLC modes provides numerous options for the separation of protein complexes and peptides.",

Such a strategy has made a great contribution in the research area of expression proteomics. While the \u201ctop-down\u201d method is based on the separations of intact protein complexes, therefore it is able to get molecular information about the intact protein and may be advantageous for the detection of proteins\u2019 post-translational modifications (PTMs) [8]. Multi-dimensional separation methods are carried out either on peptide or on protein level according to their prospective goals.",

Chromatographic together with electrophoretic methods as well as MDLC systems are still the promising methodologies for proteome research.

            "text": "Electrophoretic methods are usually combined with chromatographic separation approaches because of the orthogonality, high resolution and compatibility with chromatography. Balgley et al. developed an on-line capillary isoelectric focusing combined with nano-reversed phase liquid chromatography in an automated and integrated platform for cell heterogeneity proteome research [12]. CIEF fractions were loading directly to trap columns packed with C18 RPLC by using two 6-port micro-valves. Ten micrograms of digested proteins extracted from glioblastoma multiforme tissue were loaded in CIEF\u2013nano-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS run, and 6866 fully tryptic peptides corresponding to 1820 distinct proteins were identified. Compared with multi-dimensional HPLC runs like SCX\u2013RPLC approach, CIEF\u2013nano-RPLC method provides better resolution and requires less loading sample amount because of the ultrasensitive and excellent separation capability of capillary IEF. It is reported that the percentage of identified peptides present in more than one CIEF fraction is significantly less than that obtained from ion-exchange chromatography fractions [13]. Balgley et al. also utilize on-line CIEF\u2013nano-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS for characterization of the human salivary proteome [14]. Micro-scale solution isoelectric focusing (\u03bcsol-IEF) coupled with analytical narrow-range 2D-PAGE has been successfully used to improve detection of low-abundance proteins [15]. Westman-Brinkmalm et al. investigated \u03bcsol-IEF as the pre-fractionation method prior to LC\u2013MS/MS without cleaning up the buffer or detergent of the digested IEF fractions. This approach received better results than single LC\u2013MS/MS separating approach and was also comparable to the results of \u03bcsol-IEF coupled with 2D-PAGE in analysis of proteins from a glioma cell line [16]. Aebersold's group reported the utilization of free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) as a pre-separation method before \u03bcRPLC-MS/MS instead of ion-exchange separation of peptides for protein analysis [17]. Some on-line LC-CE systems were also reviewed by Stroink et al. [18]. Further discussion will not be taken since this paperwork concerns mainly about MDLC systems.",

            "text": "Bi-phase column was first introduced by Yates et al. [19], [20], [21] as on-line multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) where the SCX and RPLC materials are sequentially packed into a single micro-capillary column (Fig. 1\n). Similar procedures were reported for the separation of other biological fluids or cells [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Zeng et al. [27] reported an integrated column that consisted of one strong cation-exchange column and one reversed phase column. These two columns were connected directly to fulfill an on-line SCX\u2013RPLC-MS/MS analysis of mouse liver proteins. Nine pH gradients generated from citric acid\u2013trimethylamine buffer or 10 mM citric acid\u2013ammonium hydroxide buffer were utilized instead of salt gradients which is commonly used in sample elution of SCX column so that SCX fractions can be loaded directly into RPLC column. The exclusion of salt removal steps in traditional SCX\u2013RPLC on-line or off-line separation approach is the key point to achieve fast 2D-LC separation and MS/MS identification. On this basis Zeng's group developed a SCX and SAX (strong anion-exchange chromatography) combined pre-fractionation strategy called Yin-Yang multi-dimensional chromatography. It was used to provide an unbiased profiling of protein expression and phosphorylation of mouse liver tissue [28]. Peptides generated from SCX column with elution buffer at pH 2.5 were further separated by SAX column which also used a series of pH gradient buffer for gradient elution. Thereafter SAX fractions together with other SCX fractions were analyzed by nano-RPLC-MS/MS. This Yin-Yang MDLC was demonstrated to bare comprehensive separation ability towards peptide complexes with wide-spread pI values.",

SCX trap column was employed to play the role of RP trap column to gain higher peak capacity. On the other hand, SCX trap column was coupled with nanoflow RPLC-MS/MS to fulfill multi-dimensional separations by introducing several volatile salt gradient steps to elute peptides bound to SCX trap column gradually. Another application of this SCX trap column system was investigated by Wang et al. in the same research group [30]. Since SCX trap column was used instead of RP trap column, good separation performance as well as good proteomic coverage was presented. Especially, basic and hydrophilic peptides with pI\n > 4.5 and GRAVY < \u22120.5 were found to be more efficiently analyzed.",

A lot of mid- and low-abundance proteins as well as proteins with extreme MW or pI were found in this work. Both pre- and post-proteolytic separations were studied to reveal that 3D chromatography was more effective for complicated proteome analysis. Both strategies were recommended to use for complicated samples, and post-proteolytic procedure was more efficient in protein identifications. Conrads et al.

An on-line combination of CIEF to nano-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS was developed by Lee's group for intact yeast protein characterization [62]. Soluble fractions of intact protein from S. cereviseae were separated to nine fractions which were subsequently parked to C18 trap columns to fulfill on-line connection and separation with nano-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 534 proteins with molecular weight between 5 and 70 kDa were identified from this intact protein-based approach. Liquid IEF combined with capillary LC separations were also reported [70].

Some new strategies of high-abundant protein depletion were proposed in addition to widely used immuno-affinity depletions. Gradiflow [66] is capable of separating proteins of different molecular weight and pI values to achieve the depletion of albumin in human plasma. Wasinger et al. [67] adopted Gradiflow strategy as the pre-fractionation step prior to 2D-LC\u2013MS/MS analysis of human plasma proteome. Zhang's group [68] developed a novel strategy of multi-dimensional chromatography separation in intact protein level for the depletion of high-abundant proteins existed in rat liver tissue extraction, as shown in Fig. 3\n. Protein samples were first separated with a SCX column and fractions were collected every 2 min. Then SCX fractions were loaded onto RPLC column, respectively. Peak intensity of RPLC chromatogram detected by UV absorption detection was used to distinguish high-abundant proteins from mid- and low-abundant proteins. RPLC fractions with peak intensity above 0.1AU were taken as high-abundant proteins and depleted. After separations, fractions of high-abundance proteins were tryptically digested and MS/MS analyzed, whereas other fractions defined as mid- and low-abundant proteins were pooled together and submitted for further RPLC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 4\n). The number of identified proteins was increased about three times in comparing to a 2D-LC due to the depletion of high-abundant proteins. This strategy was demonstrated to be more universal and low cost for proteome analysis.",

Qian et al. compared five approaches for the characterization of human serum proteome [69]. Six proteins with highest abundance were depleted and the serum was further analyzed using different combination of separation methods such as chromatography/2D-PAGE, on-line or off-line LC\u2013LC\u2013MS spectrum. Different approaches bring up different information of sample's proteome. Meanwhile, selection of separation strategies can improve system resolution effectively. Barnea et al. [70] evaluated three pre-fractionation methods including SCX chromatography, SDS-PAGE and liquid phase IEF prior to 1D or 2D capillary LC separation. Hoffman et al. [11] evaluated comprehensive multi-dimensional separation strategies. Utilizing more than two dimensions of fractionation can effectively profile the low-abundance proteins in plasma proteome research. When the goal of proteome analysis is to find as many proteins as possible, the use of different pre-fractionation methods are quite necessary. Boyes et al. [71] integrated LC and PAGE methods for human serum proteome analysis. High protein recovery was maintained in pre-fractionation step so as to realize unbiased and reproducible analysis results. LC coupled with PAGE was also evaluated by Marcus et al. in analysis of membrane protein from mouse brain [72]. One-dimensional RPLC separation, 2D SCX/RPLC separation, PAGE/SCX/RPLC separation and 2D-PAGE strategies were assessed in this work. MDLC strategy seems to be less discriminating for hydrophobic membrane proteins and it is a complementary to 2D-PAGE for profiling of many proteome samples.",

[73] presented a dual-phase ion-exchange chromatography as a pre-fractionation method prior to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/reversed phase liquid chromatography tandem MS spectrometry. The dual-phase ion-exchange chromatography column named CAX contained both cation- and anion-exchange media together to achieve a better recovery of proteins than single-phase IEX columns. Extract proteins from 1 mg cerebellum and cortex tissues were loaded to the column, respectively and the fractions were collected every minute and submitted to further analysis by SDS-PAGE for comparison of cerebellum and cortex proteomics. More than twice of the differential protein spots were observed through CAX-PAGE-RPLC-MS/MS approach. Hanash's group [74] have implemented an orthogonal three-dimensional intact protein analysis system coupled with protein tagging and immuno-depletion of abundant proteins to quantitatively profile the human plasma proteome. After immuno-depletion, dyed and mixed proteins were subsequently separated by IEF, RPLC and SDS-PAGE. Differences in the abundance of resolved proteins were determined based on dye ratios. This strategy was applied to profile the plasma proteome for changes with acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Using capillary HPLC ESI Q-TOF MS, 75 proteins were identified in the micro- to femtomolar ranges that exhibited quantitative differences between the pre- and post-GVHD samples. Kakisaka et al. [75] investigated the aberrant expression of plasma proteins in patients with pancreatic cancer by multi-dimensional liquid chromatography and 2D fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Six high-abundance plasma proteins were depleted by use of an immuno-affinity column, and low-abundance ones were separated into five fractions by anion-exchange chromatography. The fractionated plasma proteins were subjected to 2D-DIGE with highly sensitive fluorescent dyes. Finally 33 different proteins between non-cancer bearing healthy donors and patients with pancreatic cancer were found including 27 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated in cancer. The up-regulation of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG) was not previously identified in pancreatic cancer. It has a clinical significance as a cancer biomarker.",

            "text": "Array-based electrophoretic strategies such as protein chips and capillary electrophoresis array have been successfully applied in genome and proteome research with their high throughput and fast analysis time. Chromatography array technology has some challenges because of the complexity and high requirements for HPLC systems. However, many progresses have been made toward this area. Horn et al. [76] presented a high-throughput procedure for proteome research of native constituents. Human serum sample was first separated with SEC column in a mild condition and collected in 96-well microplate. Ninety-six anion-exchange columns (AEC) were arranged just as 96-well microplate to separate SEC fractions in a parallel way. All fractions were submitted for quantitative assay and MS identification. The use of microplate as a medium made it possible to fulfill a high-throughput array separation. This can even increase the system resolution by the adoption of a third separation dimension. Our group developed a capillary array RPLC-based multi-dimensional separation systems coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS for high-throughput proteome research [77], [78]. It includes a SCX column as the first dimension and 10 parallel capillary RPLC columns as the second dimension [77]. The schematic diagram was shown in Fig. 5\n. Multiple channel interface was fabricated. Digested proteins extracted from liver cancer tissue were analyzed by the system. Over 1202 proteins were found with only one-tenth time needed in common 2D-LC system. An automated and optimized system was further developed [78]. Capillary SCX chromatographic column was used as the first dimension and 18 parallel capillary RPLC columns were integrated as the second separation dimension (Fig. 6\n). Peptides bound to the SCX phase were eluted using gradient elution. Effluents were sequentially transferred onto each subset of precolumns. After salt fractionation peptide fractions were concurrently back-flushed from the precolumns and separated simultaneously with 18 capillary RP columns. LC effluents were directly deposited onto the MALDI target plates for subsequent MALDI experiments. An 18-fold increase in throughput compared with serial-based 2D-LC system was realized by this new system. The effectiveness of array-based MDLC/MS platform for separation and identification of a complex proteome sample demonstrated that it would be a powerful high-throughput way for large-scale proteome research.",

The MDLC analytical strategies mainly include bottom-up and top-down approaches. Electrophoretic methods combined with variety of liquid chromatography and MDLC also have been successful applied for protein analysis. New progressive strategies using MDLC techniques in high-abundance protein depletions and chromatography array were also perspective in the future proteome analysis. Some prospective applications using MDLC strategies for protein\u2013protein interaction studies [79], biological sample analysis and traditional Chinese medicine analysis [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85] also have great significance in analytical science.",
