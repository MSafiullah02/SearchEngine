            "text": "The possibility of a global pandemic of an infectious respiratory disease is of tremendous concern to the occupational health community, because healthcare workers would face the greatest risk of exposure. For pandemic diseases that may be transmitted by airborne particles, the isolation precaution guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) call for healthcare workers to wear respiratory protection while treating patients.(1) Because of their loose fit and low filtration capacity, surgical masks do not provide respiratory protection from small airborne particles.(1,2) For this reason, the most common respiratory protection device used in healthcare settings is the disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). However, infection control procedures typically call for disposable FFRs to be discarded after a single use to avoid cross-contamination. This means that a pandemic of a disease such as influenza would require a tremendous number of FFRs to protect healthcare workers from airborne transmission. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) projected that a 6-week influenza pandemic would require 90 million FFRs.(3) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has predicted that an influenza pandemic would likely last 24 weeks, which suggests that up to 360 million FFRs could be needed in the United States alone.(4) A surge in demand of this magnitude would greatly exceed current stockpiles and production capabilities, and would almost certainly result in a shortage.",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the CDC recommended that healthcare facilities consider extending the use of and reusing N95 respirators if necessary.(5) However, a significant concern with reuse is the possibility that the external surfaces of the respirator will become contaminated with infectious material and lead to disease transmission if, for example, a worker touches the respirator surface while re-donning it. To avoid this, FFRs would need to be decontaminated after each use. The IOM determined that no effective decontamination strategy existed for disposable respirators and recommended that this be explored.(3)",

Some studies have looked at the effects of UVGI on respirator appearance, fit, airflow resistance, and filtration efficiency after one to three decontamination cycles and have found no significant effects.(7,10,12) However, the effects of extended exposures to UVGI after multiple decontamination cycles are not known, and it is unclear how large a cumulative dose of UVGI respirators can withstand, what damage eventually occurs, or how many times disposable FFRs could potentially be decontaminated and reused.",

UV-C irradiance was measured using a radiometer (ILT-1700, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA). Eight respirator coupons were placed on a horizontal surface so that the coupons and the sensor were approximately 6.2 cm below the lamps. A section of filter cassette was attached to the sensor head of the radiometer so that the irradiation of the sensor head would match that of the coupons. Calibration measurements using the radiometer showed that the irradiance of the eight positions varied by no more than \u00b14%. Samples were also rotated once among the positions when they were flipped so that the mean exposures for the different groups were within \u00b10.1% of each other. The respirator coupons were exposed to 0, 120, 240, 470, or 950 J/cm2 of UV-C on each side (one side was exposed at a time).

The layers were tested separately because some layers are much stronger than others in the same respirator, and changes in some layers might be masked by other layers. In addition, the UVGI dose received by the outer and innermost layers is higher than the middle layers because of attenuation. Analyzing the layers separately therefore provided better information on the effects of UVGI on the material. The bursting strength of each layer was measured using a half-scale version of the fixture described in ASTM Standard D3787(18) mounted in a materials testing machine (Model 5569A, Instron, Norwood, MA). Each coupon layer was clamped in a ring-shaped holder with a 22 mm central hole and rounded edges. A 12.7 mm polished steel ball was pushed through the material at a traverse rate of 2.5 mm/sec and the maximum force before failure was recorded. The respirator straps were clamped in the materials testing machine after UVGI exposure and stretched at a traverse rate of 5 mm/sec until breaking.",

No obvious dose-response relationship occurred between the UVGI dose and the change in penetration, probably due in large part to variability in the coupons and the penetration test itself. These results suggest that UVGI could be used for respirator disinfection, but would need to be implemented cautiously, especially for respirators with a smaller safety margin between the actual penetration value and the 5% maximum allowed for an N95 respirator. It also suggests that each individual model of respirator to be disinfected should be tested, and that more testing is needed to determine if the particle penetration through UVGI-exposed respirators can increase to unacceptable values in some cases. The flow resistance was essentially unchanged after UVGI exposure for all of respirators tested, and it seems unlikely that the flow resistance will be a matter of concern with a UVGI system.",

At the highest doses, many of the layers had lost most or all of their strength, and in several cases the material was visibly degraded with obvious breaks or tears and came apart easily. This suggests that the upper limit for UVGI exposure during repeated disinfection cycles would be set by the physical degradation of the respirator material and not by a loss in filtration capacity. For some respirator models, this could potentially serve as a useful warning; if the respirator material is degraded noticeably after UVGI disinfection, the respirator should be discarded. The respirator straps retained most of their strength even at the highest doses, which suggests again that the degradation of the body of the respirator will be the limiting factor in the use of UVGI and not the degradation of the straps. We believe that the most likely reason that the filtration capacity and the flow resistance do not change substantially even though the strength decreases is that the amount of physical load placed on the respirator material during filtration testing (and in normal use) is much lower than the maximum strength of the material. Consequently, the respirator material has a tremendous reserve capacity of physical strength. Although UVGI reduces the strength and toughness of polymers like polypropylene, the fibers will not actually break unless they are stressed.(14) Thus, we think the filter layer remains intact and is able to maintain its filtration capacity.",

The UVGI dose, in turn, is controlled by the amount of UVGI required to inactivate any pathogens on the respirator. Two studies of UVGI disinfection of respirators exposed to droplets and aerosols containing influenza virus found that a 1.8 J/cm2 dose was sufficient to reduce the amount of viable influenza virus by a factor of >104 (>4-log reduction).(6,8) This suggests that, for influenza virus, dozens of UVGI disinfection cycles could be performed on respirators without the UVGI affecting their performance. Other pathogens require higher UVGI doses for disinfection (broadly speaking, to achieve a given reduction in viability, bacteria require higher doses than viruses and spores require much higher doses than vegetative cells).(14) For example, the UVGI dose required to disable 90% of a pathogen in aqueous suspension has been reported to be about 2.3 mJ/cm2 for influenza A virus, 4.8 mJ/cm2 for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes tuberculosis), and 41.1 mJ/cm2 for Bacillus anthracis spores (which cause anthrax).(14) Thus, the utility of a UVGI system for disinfecting respirators may depend in part upon the pathogen involved.",

This is not a concern if disinfection of the exterior layers of the respirator is sufficient, but needs to be considered if complete disinfection is required. Fisher and Shaffer examined this question and estimated that, to expose the innermost part of a respirator to a given dose of UVGI, the exterior dose needed to be from 3.2\u2013400 times the required interior level, depending upon the model of the respirator.(17) This suggests that some respirator models may work better with a UVGI system than others.

Our results suggest that, with the appropriate design and choice of materials, a respirator and UVGI system could be designed to meet this goal. It would be relatively easy to design a small UVGI system that could meet the 60-sec cycle goal, while this would be extremely difficult for a chemical immersion, vapor, or steam-based system. In addition, because UVGI does not involve hazardous chemicals and can be reasonably compact and inexpensive, such systems could be deployed virtually anywhere within a healthcare facility for quick and easy disinfection of respirators by workers after tending to a patient.\n\n",
