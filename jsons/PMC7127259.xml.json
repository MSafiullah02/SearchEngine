This might be partly due to the focus on individual information practices in existing models of information behavior (IB). IB \u201cis conceptualized by many of these models as an intrinsically individual activity\u201d (Reddy & Jansen, 2008, p. 257), and presented as \u201ca linear process consisting of stages and iterative activities\u201d (Foster, 2004, p. 228).",

However, a major limitation of Foster's model is lack of clarity about how the contextual layers are linked to the information core processes.

However, ANT provides a more effective means to capture the non-linear movements of complex social, political, cognitive, and technological negotiations involved in information-sharing practices in academic communities. Latour's (1999) circulatory system of scientific facts is used as a foundation for building a non-linear model of information-sharing practices in academic communities. The main proposition of this model is that although information-sharing practices are shaped by contextual elements, they simultaneously shape the contextual elements. The main difference between this model and other IB models, including Foster's model, is this focus on the interdependence between context and information practices. Instead of a priori placing actors in a context, this model follows the actors in information-sharing practices, as they create context for themselves. As such, the model may contribute to understanding information-sharing practices from the actors' point of view.",

His initial analysis of 45 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with academic and postgraduate researchers suggested that scholars' information-seeking activities involved three sequential stages: initial, middle, and final. However, subsequent testing resulted in the emergence of additional underlying themes and activities that could not be explained by a stage model. This inability indicated a need for a conceptual shift from understanding information seeking as a linear process, consisting of stages, to a view of information-seeking activities \u201cdescribed in terms of concurrent, continuous, cumulative, and looped cycles occurring throughout a research project\u201d (Foster, 2004, p. 232). Foster classified these emergent concepts and activities into three core processes: opening, orientation, and consolidation. These three core processes are situated within three levels of contextual interaction: external context, internal context, and cognitive approach.",

Information behavior changes with any contextual change, and with any new information-seeking experience. Information-seeking activities are therefore \u201canalogous to an information seeker holding a palette of information behavior opportunities with the whole palette available at any given moment\u201d (Foster, 2004, p. 235).",

Although problem definition is a stage placed at the beginning of information seeking in linear models, in Foster's model, the problem definition \u201coccurs continuously through to closure\u201d (Foster, 2006, p. 162). Likewise, in linear models, problem solving is seen as a process of moving through successive stages toward a solution: With each stage the level of certainty is increased, until a stage of problem resolution is reached. On the other hand, in Foster's model, the certainty level is the product of a complex interaction between core processes and contextual elements, so that some activities can increase the level of certainty, and others can reduce it. The level of certainty is also determined by \u201cprevious knowledge, previous information seeking, and other contextual elements\u201d (Foster, 2006, p. 163). Information seeking is completed when information seekers \u201chave achieved what they consider an appropriate level of certainty for each of the problem elements for which they establish a personal threshold\u201d (Foster, 2006, pp. 163\u2013164).",

            "text": "However, Foster's model lacks clarity as to how the contextual layers are linked to the information core processes. The graphical representation of Foster's model (Fig. 1) shows contextual layers as three nested squares that serve as containers for the information-seeking core processes; the movement of information practices is limited to the confines of defined contextual elements. Foster (2006) states that the core processes \u201care placed within [emphasis added] an interactive framework of contexts, and a cognitive approach\u201d (p. 159), which suggests a one-directional causal relationship from context upon information practices. This relationship is not one-directional: Although information-sharing practices may be shaped by context, they also shape the context. Thus a layered presentation of contextual elements is not an adequate representation of the complex non-linear interrelationship between context and information-sharing practices. This suggests that there is a need for a different graphical representation, as well as theoretical conceptualization of the context in order to capture the complexity of the links between information practices and contextual elements. The proposition is that ANT can provide the means to capture these links by shifting attention from a predetermined existence of the connection to the action of network building, since \u201cthe existence of this connection depends on what the actors have done or not done to establish it\u201d (Latour, 1999, p. 86).",

            "text": "ANT emerged during the 1980s within the sociology of science and technology, with the work of Bruno Latour, Michael Callon, and John Law. One of the main assumptions of ANT is that science is the process of heterogeneous engineering in which the social, natural, and discursive are puzzled together in the process of translation. Basic concepts of ANT include actor and network. An actor is any agent, collective or individual, that can associate or disassociate with other actors. An actor is not just a point object or a placeholder (Latour, 2005, p. 153), but an association of heterogeneous elements, so that each actor is also a simplified network (Law, 1992). Since \u201cactor\u201d is frequently used to refer exclusively to humans, the term actant \u201cis sometimes used to include nonhumans in the definition\u201d (Latour, 1999, p. 303). An actor or actant is \u201csomething that acts or to which activity is granted by others. . . .[which] can literally be anything provided it is granted to be the source of an action\u201d (Latour, 1997). The word \u201cnetwork\u201d came from the attempt to describe society not as two-dimensional or three-dimensional but \u201cin terms of nodes that have as many dimensions as they have connections\u201d (Latour, 1997). The notion of network enables ANT to replace spatial metaphors such as close/far, up/down, local/global, and inside/outside with associations and connections that are not exclusively social, natural, or technological. This is where ANT differs from most approaches to context, including Foster's, in the IB field.",

These activities are represented as five interactive loops: mobilization of the world; autonomization; alliances; public representation, and links and knots.

This loop deals with the ways that disciplines and institutions provide credibility to the world mobilized in the first loop.

Creating alliances is not a linear process going from basic to applied research. Howells, Nedeva, and Georghiou (1998) point out in their UK survey on industry-academic collaboration that although the significance of linkages between industry and academic communities has become fully recognized since the 1970s, these linkages go back to the late 19th century with the establishment of so called \u201credbrick\u201d universities in the industrial areas of Britain. The aim of these universities was both to serve the academic communities, and align them to the local industry and economy. Recently, for example, we have seen a number of alliances built by academic communities interested in developing clean energy. Developing clean energy is becoming a major issue in winning elections in many countries. Unlikely actors, such as the automobile or coal industries, are building alliances with academic communities. These alliances appear more and more inevitable as academic communities translate their interests and the interests of industry into a composite goal. By shifting their interests, both industry and academic communities are not only creating a new goal, but also building a new context. So, the context is created by actors themselves through a chain of translations. If we place a priori this collaboration in an external contextual element, for example capitalism, and/or in an internal contextual element, such as \u201canomalous state of knowledge\u201d (Belkin, 2005), we will not be able to understand this hard work of building alliances. Instead, we should follow the actors themselves in their world-building activities.",

Or after any attempt of sifting, which is \u201cthe process of deciding which material and sources were relevant\u201d (Foster, 2004, p. 234), there is a possibility of moving the circulation of the model out of the loop of the mobilization of the world. The process of serendipity can move the circulation of the contextual elements in even more unpredictable directions. These dynamic non-linear interrelationships between all loops, and between all loops and all core processes, is the main reason for the non-linear nature of information behavior in general, particularly in information-sharing practices.",

The level of certainty is defined as a product of interactions between core processes and contextual elements (Foster, 2006), but ultimately, according to Foster, individual seekers determine what is an appropriate level of certainty according to their personal threshold (Foster, 2006). This contradiction is a result of a rigid presentation of contextual layers in Foster's model. As the contextual layers are presented as squares, layers, and containers, it is possible to regard them as separate entities, and consequently, to have different answers for different entities. It is possible to say that problem solving is determined by relationships between different actors, but ultimately, it is an individual seeker who has the last word. For ANT, problem definition and problem solving are the result of negotiations between different actors. They are not \u201cgenerated by the state of knowledge\u2026[but] they result from the definition and interrelation of actors that were not previously linked to one another\u201d (Callon, 1986, p. 228). The result of negotiation of these actors is continuous problem redefinition, which is one of the main reasons for non-linearity in information practices.",
