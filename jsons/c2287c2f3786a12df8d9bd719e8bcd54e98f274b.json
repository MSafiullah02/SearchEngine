In 2018, Lin et al. [27] offered a new coordinated home healthcare routing and scheduling problem by using a hybrid metaheuristic based on harmony search algorithm (HSA) and GA. They also added immigrant schemes and inheritance to this problem to consider the synchronization of the caregivers. Liu et al., [28] introduced another formulation of the bi-objective optimization to consider the medical team working in home care services. In addition to the transportation costs, they minimized the unemployment of caregivers through a group of medical operations. In another paper concerning metaheuristic algorithms, a memetic algorithm (MA) for the first time was applied by Decerle et al., [1] to a single objective multi-period routing and scheduling problem of the home healthcare. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm was firstly contributed by Fathollahi-Fard et al. [3] . They also considered a penalty function to better optimize the routes of caregivers known as travel balancing. In another study, Cappanera et al. [29] proposed a robust optimization of the routing and scheduling problem for a home healthcare under uncertainty. As another multi-objective optimization, Fathollahi-Fard et al. [9] contributed the environmental pollution to the home healthcare by considering the operational routing and scheduling decisions. They developed four heuristics based on two decision rules to find an interaction between the transportation costs and green emissions. They also utilized salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and its hybridization with SA for the first time.",

In our work, a bi-objective home healthcare routing and scheduling problem considering the patients' satisfaction under uncertainty, is firstly proposed. The proposed model is a multi-period, multi-depot, and multi-objective optimization of the home healthcare operations. In addition, to the delivery time and time window suppositions, there are also different transportation systems and travel balancing limitations similar to many recent studies [26] ; [3] ; [9] ; [32] ; [12] [13] . Due to the uncertainty of some parameters, a fuzzy approach based on Jimenez's method is applied for the first time. Lastly, a multi-objective version of SEO is modified by an adaptive strategy to improve its performance and computational cost. This algorithm is not only compared with itself but also SA and GA (non-dominated sorting GA abbreviated as NSGA-II) as the well-known algorithms in the literature.",

A matrix with the length of N is considered. (0, ) U K as a uniform distribution where K is the number of vehicles provided in the first phase.

Exploitation is typically the most demanding of the two. Given that the training and retraining phase is key to the exploitation phase, the proposed extension is to make that process more efficient. For the existing SEO training and retraining of the attacker, a percentage of defender traits as \u03b1 is selected randomly. Rather than employing an arbitrary selection process, the AMSEO extension identifies if any specific trait is having a generally successful impact on the defender over the course of different iterations (whereupon the new defender can dominate the old one). Whenever any such trait is identified, the selection process is modified so that this trait can increase the chance of selection. The selection process adapts to reflect the more successful patterns of selection, learned over time. For example, consider that there are four traits and the initial rate of \u03b1 is to weight each probability of selection equally, at 0.25 for each, {0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25}. Over time the rates of success for each trait is recorded, and the relative probabilities adjusted accordingly. Thus, for a rate of success across the four traits of {3, 4, 2, 2}, the selection probabilities are adjusted to {0.27, 0.36, 0.18, 0.18}, respectively.",

A utility function proposed by Derringer and Suich [60] is applied to assess the metrics of each Pareto-optimal set, and optimize the multiple responses of the RSM, as computed by: (31) where the multiple response is transformed into the measurement of the utility function ( ). and are the lower and upper bounds of response variables, respectively. The utility function is emphasized by . Accordingly, the relative importance of the metrics is taken from the literature [48, 13, 9, 49] .The desirability of the algorithm in terms of the number of utility functions is computed by: (32) Notably, the evaluation metrics number are m. As such, D is the total desirability of the algorithm. It is evident that the higher the value of D, the more favorable is the algorithm. Table 5 presents the approximate values of the tuned parameters, the R-squared (R 2 ) of assessment metrics, and the total desirability (D). Notably, R 2 measures statistically how closely the outputs fit the line of regression. The range of R 2 is always between 0 and 100%.

Additionally, the number of assumed caregivers (N p ) has been focused on some sensitivity analyses. The reports are given in Table 10 and Fig. 11 . Although the caregivers' number is increased, the total cost and patients' satisfaction reveal a different growth in analyzed scenarios. Accordingly, the changes are low. The total cost is firstly increased and then is fixed. The patients' satisfaction is also better by incentives incensement. The patients may have more choices with better privileges to caregivers. With regards to the objective functions' behavior, although an additional caregiver can increase the total cost, it is useful to satisfy the patients by providing a full range of the services.

From the majority of cases, specifically and perhaps in European and North American countries, the ageing population care is a challengeable concern. More broadly, in a case of an epidemic disease like COVID-19 in 2020 [62] , the best and efficient way to do the care, is staying at home along with considering the healthcare instruments. Therefore, a simplified model to the home healthcare is not suitable to fully deliver all the real aspects of this important optimization problem. This paper aims to introduce an extension to the home healthcare optimization which is performance and practical. No doubt a multi-objective optimization is needed to accommodate the total cost of a structured logistics network with a set of pharmacies and laboratories as well as the patients' satisfaction to provide better home care services. As some parameters of the model are uncertain, this study uses a fuzzy Jimenez's method to control the uncertainty of service times, the privilege from patients to caregivers based on their performance from previous data and other key parameters of model. This estimation is done by using the triangular fuzzy numbers to consider the optimistic, realistic and pessimistic scenarios for these parameters.
