Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled largescale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both short-and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach and represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.",

This approach has the disadvantage that samples must typically be sequenced very deeply in order to obtain sufficient coverage of the viral genome, and thus the cost of this approach is high relative to more targeted methods. Sequence capture methods ( Figure 1A) can be used to enrich for viral sequences in order to lower sequencing costs and are being employed to sequence SARS-CoV-2 (11) . Finally, amplicon approaches ( Figure 1B) , in which cDNA is made from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and amplified using primers that generate tiled PCR products are being used to sequence SARS-CoV-2 (3). Since primers cannot capture the very ends of the viral genome, amplicon approaches have the drawback of slightly less complete genome coverage, and mutations in primer binding sites have the potential to disrupt the amplification of the associated amplicon. However, the relatively low-cost of amplicon methods make them a good choice for population-scale viral surveillance and such approaches have recently been used successfully to monitor the spread of viruses such as Zika and Ebola (2) (3) (4) .",

This approach incorporates adapter tails in the ARTIC v3 primer designs, allowing sequencing libraries to be produced in a two-step PCR process, bypassing costly and labor-intensive ligation or tagmentation-based library preparation steps. By reoptimizing the pooling strategy for the tailed primers, we demonstrate that this tailed amplicon approach can achieve similar coverage to the untailed ARTIC v3 primers at equivalent sequencing depths. We benchmark this approach against both the standard ARTIC v3 protocol and a sequence capture approach using clinical samples spanning a range of viral loads. The",

Despite observing negligible amounts of primer dimer products on the bioanalyzer trace, samples with N1 and N2 Ct values greater than 30 had as much as 50% primer dimer in the resulting sequencing reads. We have previously reported a substantial size bias on the MiSeq, which may help explain the preferential clustering and out-sized proportion of primer dimer reads present in the sequencing data for some samples (15) . While this issue can be overcome by increased sequencing depth, future optimizations aimed at reducing primer dimer contamination such as more stringent size selection or sequencing on an instrument with less size bias, such as the NovaSeq (15) could reduce this effect.",

In comparing the sequence capture and amplicon-based methods, there is a trade-off between the completeness of genome coverage and sensitivity (being able to analyze samples with higher N1 and N2 Ct values. Consistent with other recent analyses of SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing approaches (16), we observed highly concordant results from samples with N1 and N2 Ct values of less than 30. For samples with Ct values between 30 and 35, coverage metrics tended to be less robust at a given read depth and samples with Ct values of greater than 35 did not perform well under any of the conditions tested. Based on validation experiments for the University of Minnesota qRT-PCR clinical COVID-19 diagnostic assay, we estimate that a Ct value of 30 corresponds to roughly 500 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies and a Ct value of 35 corresponds to roughly 15 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in the 5 \u00b5L input used for cDNA creation (17) .",

Through an iterative testing process, we demonstrate that with the tailed amplicon v2 method, a four-pool amplification scheme produces data with comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach. The tailed amplicon approach bypasses costly and labor-intensive library preparation steps and will allow for production of SARS-CoV-2 libraries at high scale (similar workflows are run on tens of thousands of samples per year in the University of Minnesota Genomics Center) at low cost (between $20-40 per sample depending on scale, including labor costs).
