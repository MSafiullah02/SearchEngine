Type three effectors (T3Es) of Gram\u2010negative bacteria are major virulence factors in interactions with both plant and animal hosts. These proteins are secreted directly in host cells by the type three secretion system (T3SS), which is a complex protein structure anchored in the bacterial membrane (Diepold & Armitage, 2015). In pathogenic interactions, T3SS may enable the development of disease (via neutralization of plant defences and manipulation of host cellular processes) or trigger host resistance (through recognition inducing hypersensitive response). The T3SS is also widespread in mutualistic and commensal bacteria of protist, fungal and animal hosts (Abby & Rocha, 2012). As the T3SS and T3Es play a crucial role in prokaryote\u2013eukaryote interactions, knowledge of their origin and evolution is likely to be crucial to deepen our understanding of host adaptation.",

Abby and Rocha (2012) recently proposed that the T3SS evolved by exaptation from the flagellar cluster. Further T3SS diversification then lead to seven distinct families of T3SSs (Ysc, SPI\u20101, SPI\u20102, Chlamy, Hrp1, Hrp2 and Rhizo) (Troisfontaines & Cornelis, 2005). Diversification of the T3SS is not explained simply by vertical evolution. Indeed, it was shown that the evolution of the T3SS cluster has included numerous horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) (Troisfontaines & Cornelis, 2005). These HGT events are facilitated by localization of T3SS cluster in plasmids or chromosomal pathogenicity islands.",

            "text": "Extensive diversification of the T3SS seems to be driven by bacteria ecology, as T3SS families correlate with the host type. Indeed, Rhizo, Hrp1 and Hrp2 seem to be more frequently involved in interactions with plants, whereas Ysc, Chlamy, SPI\u20101 and SPI\u20102 appear to be specific to interactions with mammals, insects and amoeba (Abby & Rocha, 2012; Diepold & Armitage, 2015; Troisfontaines & Cornelis, 2005). In general, each bacterial genus harbours a T3SS from a specific family but some bacteria with complex lifestyles harbour several T3SS from different families. These contrasting patterns of T3SS content could be explained by ancient vertical inheritance mixed with T3SS gain and loss events (Kirzinger, Butz, & Stavrinides, 2015). The main T3SS families found in phytopathogens are Hrp1 (in Pseudomonas and Erwinia) and Hrp2 (in Xanthomonas, Ralstonia, Acidovorax and Burkholderia); however, alternative noncanonical T3SS has also been described in some plant\u2010associated bacteria such as commensal pseudomonads associated with plants (Barret et al., 2013). These two main families of T3SS clusters, Hrp1 and Hrp2, differ in gene content, synteny and transcriptional regulation. Approximately 20 protein\u2010coding genes, called hrp (hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity) and hpa (hrp\u2010associated) genes, are involved in the biogenesis of T3SS. Among them, nine genes, which were renamed hrc (hrp conserved), are highly conserved in plant and animal pathogens, and eight have homologs in the flagellar cluster (Tampakaki et al., 2010).",

            "text": "T3E repertoires are highly diverse within each genus and even within single bacterial species (McCann & Guttman, 2008). They vary both in terms of content and size, for instance a given Xanthomonas axonopodis strain may have any between six and 26 T3E genes (Hajri et al., 2009). It has been suggested that this high variability could be the consequence of the host adaptation process. Indeed, in Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas, the pathogenic strains are highly host specific and the T3E repertoire composition is correlated with host range (Hajri et al., 2009; Sarkar, Gordon, Martin, & Guttman, 2006). The plasticity of T3E repertoire within a species could be explained by frequent HGTs (McCann & Guttman, 2008) as many T3E genes have been found associated with mobile genetic elements. Understanding the diversity and evolution of T3E repertoires in pathogenic bacteria is essential to gain insight into host adaptation mechanisms. However, identification of T3E genes in whole\u2010genome sequences remains a challenge as T3Es are structurally and functionally highly diverse with more than 50 families identified so far in Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas (Lindeberg, Cunnac, & Collmer, 2012; Ryan et al., 2011). Recently, machine\u2010learning approaches have been developed. They rely on multiple criteria such as the presence of a secretion signal necessary for recognition by T3SS machinery that is found in N\u2010terminal region of T3E (McDermott et al., 2011) or specific amino acid composition (Lower & Schneider, 2009). In Xanthomonas, these approaches have enabled the identification of seven novel T3Es in the reference strain 85\u201010 (Teper et al., 2016), exhibiting great promise for future discoveries with the exponential growth of genomic data.",

The major pathogenicity determinants of xanthomonads are the Hrp2 type\u2010T3SS and its effectors (White, Potnis, Jones, & Koebnik, 2009). Xanthomonas albilineans is an exception in the genus as it has no Hrp2 family gene cluster, but a SPI\u20101 T3SS (Marguerettaz et al., 2011). Four Xanthomonas species lacking any Hrp\u2010T3SSs and associated T3Es, namely Xanthomonas sacchari (Studholme et al., 2011), \u201cXanthomonas cannabis\u201d (Jacobs, Pesce, Lefeuvre, & Koebnik, 2015), \u201cXanthomonas pseudalbilineans\u201d (Pieretti et al., 2015) and Xanthomonas maliensis (Triplett et al., 2015) were recently described. Moreover, some Xanthomonas arboricola strains were also found without any T3SS (Cesbron et al., 2015; Merda et al., 2016). The X. arboricola strains lacking any T3SSs are considered commensal, as no pathogenicity on their respective hosts has been observed. The X. arboricola species has an epidemic population structure, where epidemic clones are represented by successful pathovars (defined as pathovars responsible for epidemics worldwide). They infect stone and nut fruit trees. The recombinant network is represented by commensal strains and unsuccessful pathovars (defined by a limited geographical and potentially temporal expansion) (Merda et al., 2016). Epidemic clone emergence seems to be correlated with the acquisition of T3Es, whereas in the recombinant network, strains would have lost T3E\u2010coding genes and the T3SS cluster.",

            "text": "The recent discovery of several Xanthomonas species and strains that lack the Hrp2 cluster has raised questions about the evolution of virulence and the origin of the T3SS in this genus. Are pathogenicity and Hrp2 clusters ancestral features of Xanthomonas that have been vertically inherited and lost in some species or do they represent more recent acquisitions? Contrasting with our deep knowledge of ancient evolutionary history of T3SS, little is known about recent origin and evolution of T3SS and its role in plant pathogen emergence. Given the pivotal role of T3SS and T3Es in xanthomonads pathogenicity and host specificity, and given their heterogeneous distribution at genus and species scales, the Hrp2 cluster and its effectors in Xanthomonas genus appear to be a good model to study T3SS origin and evolution at a fine evolutionary scale. In this study, we conducted our analyses on a collection of strains representing all valid species from the two phylogenetic groups of the genus (groups 1 and 2) as defined by Young, Park, Shearman, and Fargier (2008). We inferred their phylogenetic relatedness based on the core genome of the whole genus. Moreover, to get insights into T3SS evolution, we studied not only cluster synteny, hrc gene phylogeny and homologous recombination, but we also considered the genomic environment of the T3SS cluster. Finally, to unveil the evolution of T3E repertoires in relation with pathogen emergence, we determined the T3E repertoires in a collection of 44 X. arboricola genomes representing both commensal and pathogenic strains using a machine\u2010learning approach designed to detect T3E\u2010coding genes in Xanthomonas genome sequences.",

First, this analysis was performed only using strains having a T3SS cluster to detect conserved flanking regions upstream and downstream of the cluster between phylogenetic neighbours. For strains lacking T3SS, a BLASTn search was used to find if regions flanking T3SS in T3SS\u2010positive strains were also present in T3SS\u2010negative strains; 5\u2010Kb T3SS\u2010flanking regions identified in the closest phylogenetic neighbours of each T3SS\u2010negative strain were used as query sequences to identify the contig to use in further analyses.

Similar genomic environments of T3SS cluster were defined based on synteny and shared conserved regions spreading over at least four CDS in a 20\u2010Kb window at the left and right sides of T3SS cluster and using X. arboricola CFBP 7179 as a reference (Fig. S1). Similar genomic environments of the T3SS cluster were highlighted with the same colour as shown in Fig. S1. The same approach but using a 200\u2010Kb window upstream and downstream the cluster was used to define the genomic context of T3SS insertion site.

Given the divergence between these strains, it is tempting to speculate that Hrp2 cluster was acquired through a single acquisition event in a common ancestor. However, except in the case of clade A and X. bromi, the hrp cluster was retrieved in several different genomic environments in clades B and C (Figures 1 and S1). Two scenarios could explain this situation: the first scenario involves the loss of the ancestral Hrp2 cluster and re\u2010acquisition at a different genomic context, and the second scenario includes rearrangements in the 20\u2010kb flanking regions of the ancestral Hrp2 cluster without affecting the genomic context of T3SS insertion site. To decipher which scenario is the most probable, genomic contexts of the T3SS insertion site (i.e., broader genomic environments spreading over 200 kb upstream and downstream) were compared in clades B and C strains selected for the quality of their genome assembly (Figures 1 and S2). We showed that rearrangements occurred in the direct flanking regions of T3SS cluster of these strains but that the genomic context of T3SS cluster was similar to those of clade A strains and X. bromi. Insertions of large fragments (80 kb for X. euvesicatoria, X. alfalfae and X. fuscans and 50 kb for \u201cX. cannabis\u201d strain CFBP 7912) in T3SS flanking regions broke synteny in the 20\u2010kb window but this synteny with the direct genomic environment of X. bromi and clade A was observed further away from T3SS cluster in the clade B and C genome sequences. Thus, genomic rearrangement events and gene insertions affected the 20\u2010Kb genomic environment of the T3SS cluster but not its location in the genome; the genomic contexts of T3SS cluster remained similar. These rearrangements differed between different clades and were sometimes supported by the presence of insertion sequences (ISs) and tRNAs (Figs S1 and S2). Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that there was an ancestral acquisition of the T3SS cluster in the common ancestor of clades A, B and C and subsequent rearrangements in flanking regions of the Hrp2 cluster (Figure 1).",

The phylogenetic tree of T3SS\u2010encoding genes (Figure 2b) showed that X. campestris T3SS genes were phylogenetically related to those of clade A strains. Thus, the common ancestor of X. campestris might have acquired the hrp cluster by HGT from a clade A strain. However, the T3SS\u2010encoding genes underwent homologous recombination (see below) that altered the phylogenetic signal of the hrp genes. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that an ancestral X. campestris hrp cluster would have been replaced by homologous recombination with a clade A strain. Thus, we favour the most parsimonious scenario of an independent acquisition in X. campestris ancestor as opposed to an acquisition by the common ancestor of all group 2 strains followed by the loss of this T3SS cluster in X. campestris and its re\u2010acquisition in a different genomic context.",

One loss event could have occurred in the common ancestor of the two strains belonging to \u201cX. cannabis\u201d and two independent loss events could have occurred in X. melonis and X. pisi. As X. maliensis was the most divergent species of group 2, it was impossible to hypothesize any event responsible for absence of the T3SS cluster, and this species might have never had any T3SS cluster. In the 19 strains without T3SSs, the entire T3SS cluster was missing. No traces of pseudogenization, which could be identified by a weak homology with T3SS\u2010coding genes with a BLASTn approach, were detected. BLASTn searches with the flanking regions of the Hrp2 cluster in strains lacking it and synteny analysis allowed us to identify the probable excision sites of the DNA fragment containing the Hrp2\u2010encoding genes (Fig. S1).

Indeed, a lack of synteny in T3SS flanking regions was observed among X. fragariae, X. cassavae and other group 2 Xanthomonas species, even when flanking regions as large as 200 kb were considered (Figs S1 and S2). Because these species were localized in two different phylogenetic positions within group 2, this suggests independent re\u2010acquisition events (Figure 1). However, for X. fragariae, another hypothesis could be put forth. The position of this species is similar in the organism\u2010 and T3SS phylogenies indicating a probable ancestral T3SS acquisition. In this hypothesis, the different genomic context of T3SS could be the result of a transposition of the cluster within X. fragariae genome. Four ISs were found upstream and downstream of the T3SS cluster in X. fragariae genome that corroborated either transposition or re\u2010acquisition via HGT as a mechanism. As for strains devoid of the T3SS cluster, we looked at the insertion site of the ancestral T3SS acquisition in clades A, B and C and no remnants of the ancestral T3SS cluster were detected at this location. Xanthomonas codiaei shared the same left border of T3SS cluster as X. cassavae, its sister species, suggesting that the loss and re\u2010acquisition of T3SS cluster might have occurred in their common ancestor, but unfortunately contig interruption in X. codiaei precluded the analysis of a large genomic environment to confirm this hypothesis.",

Briefly, T3E\u2010encoding genes were searched for based on criteria referring to type three N\u2010terminal secretion signal, structural disorder, regulation by HrpX/HrpG, GC content, codon usage, amino acid properties and homology to known and validated T3Es. Based on this prediction, a set of seven ancestral core T3E genes was observed. The predicted T3E repertoires were highly variable with some strains having no T3Es and others having up to 34 predicted T3Es (Figure 4). Eight of the 14 strains lacking the T3SS cluster were also deprived of T3E\u2010coding genes. In contrast, between one and two T3E genes (avrBs2 and xopR) were identified in the remaining six strains (Data S3). While synteny in the xopR genomic environments has previously been shown (Merda et al., 2016), here we observed that genomic environments of avrBs2 were also highly syntenic between all strains, with the exception of strains CFBP 7408 and CFBP 7409 (Fig. S4), favouring an ancestral acquisition and subsequent losses of these T3Es during X. arboricola evolution. The two strains of pathovar guizotiae, CFBP 7408 and CFBP 7409, probably lost and reacquired avrBs2. It has to be noted that avrBs2 was systematically accompanied by three CDSs, namely xylR, a TonB\u2010dependent receptor and a hypothetical protein that presented the same distribution in our collection whatever the genomic context (see Fig. S4). In addition to xopR and avrBs2, five other T3E genes (already described in Xanthomonas strains) were found in all X. arboricola strains having a T3SS. These five T3E genes were located within the T3SS cluster (Figure 3b) and their distribution strictly followed the distribution of the T3SS cluster. However, among them were XopA, HpaA and HrpW, which, while listed as T3Es in some studies (Hajri et al., 2009; Merda et al., 2016), are secreted regulator (HpaA) or hairpin\u2010like proteins and their effector function remains unclear (Lorenz et al., 2008; White et al., 2009). Synteny in the flanking regions of avrBs2, xopR, and of the five T3E genes associated with the T3SS cluster suggested that they were most probably acquired by an ancient X. arboricola strain; thus, these seven T3E genes will be designated as the ancestral repertoire thereafter.",

Therefore, the pathogenicity of these bacteria, previously qualified as opportunistic pathogens (Haworth & Spiers, 1992), may rely on different virulence factors. The T3E repertoire of pathogenic strains encompassed the ancestral repertoire and a large number of additional predicted T3E genes. Indeed, the pan\u2010T3 effectome of X. arboricola was composed of 57 predicted T3Es, and among them, only 11 were found in both pathogenic and commensal strains, with the 46 others present exclusively in pathogenic strains.

To determine if their ancestral acquisition resulted from one or several events, we analysed their genomic context. Contig alignment using CFBP 2528 as reference revealed that these T3E genes were dispersed along the chromosome, except xopAV and xopQ, which were colocalized (Figs S5 and S6). The dispersal of these T3E genes along the genome sequences suggested that they were acquired following several acquisition events. Given the synteny observed in the flanking regions of each of these T3E genes in the genomes of the successful pathovars (Fig. S5), it is likely that these independent acquisition events probably occurred in their ancestor before separation into three distinct pathovars.",

We investigated T3SS evolution in the Xanthomonas genus, a major clade of plant pathogens. Comparative genomic analyses of a collection of 82 strains allowed us to infer three ancestral acquisitions of the Hrp2 gene cluster during Xanthomonas evolution, two in group 2 strains and one in group 1 strains. Indeed, we highlighted an ancestral acquisition in the common ancestor of all group 2 species excluding Xanthomonas campestris. This species, which diverged early in group 2, has a T3SS cluster at a different chromosomal location, supporting an independent acquisition event. The third ancestral T3SS acquisition occurred in group 1. A different genetic organization of the T3SS cluster, a high divergence among T3SS\u2010coding genes from the group 2 species, and the different genomic contexts of the T3SS clusters all indicate that group 1 strains probably acquired a different Hrp2 cluster independently as previously proposed by Jacobs et al. (2015). Before this study, Xanthomonas translucens was the only group 1 species known to harbour a Hrp2 cluster (Wichmann et al., 2013). Our results indicate that this atypical Hrp2 cluster is shared with Xanthomonas theicola and Xanthomonas hyacinthi and that it was probably acquired by their common ancestor. T3SS cluster acquisitions occurred before speciation of most xanthomonads; capacity to interact with plants through translocation of T3Es would thus be an ancient trait of xanthomonads as it is the case for other important plant bacterial pathogens (Diallo et al., 2012; Kirzinger et al., 2015).",

The scattering of strains without T3SS in the tree, the conservation of similar genomic environments in the T3SS\u2010positive strains, and a similar genome sequence in strains without T3SS are three lines of evidence in favour of the T3SS loss hypothesis. Absence of pseudogenes or remnants of T3SS\u2010encoding genes might be surprising, but a similar observation was made in nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains, from which the entire cluster has been excised (Mohr et al., 2008). The loss hypothesis in commensal strains of Xanthomonas arboricola species was previously proposed (Merda et al., 2016) based on Bayesian inference of gene gains and losses. Such complex scenarios with ancestral acquisition, losses and regains have also been proposed in Pantoea genus (Kirzinger et al., 2015) and P. syringae (Clarke, Cai, Studholme, Guttman, & Vinatzer, 2010).",

Indeed, it could be beneficial to lose this energetically costly machinery if it does not enhance bacterial fitness (Gophna, Ron, & Graur, 2003). Thus, for commensal strains colonizing various plant hosts and with a limited set of T3Es (like X. arboricola group B strains) (Merda et al., 2016), the fitness cost provided by T3SS might be high and consequently it could be lost. T3SS\u2010negative strains may also act as profiteers and benefit from the presence of T3SS\u2010positive strains colonizing the same niche as demonstrated in murine infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Czechowska, McKeithen\u2010Mead, Al Moussawi, & Kazmierczak, 2014).",

            "text": "Once acquired, we showed that T3SS\u2010coding genes were prone to homologous recombination events leading to replacement of large fragments encompassing one complete gene, adjacent genes or even the entire cluster. The two genes for which the number of recombination events was the highest were hrpE and hrpB2, which encode the Hrp pilin and the putative inner rod, respectively (Hartmann et al., 2012). These two proteins correspond to the early substrates of the secretion machinery. Weber and Koebnik (2006) observed positive diversifying selection in the hrpE sequence corresponding to the surface exposed part of the protein and interpreted it as an adaptative mechanism of the pathogen to escape recognition by the host. Homologous replacement of the hrpE gene by recombination could be an alternative mechanism to generate diversity and to escape host recognition. This latter mechanism has been extensively described in the mammalian pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae where it drives antigenic variation of the type IV pilus and avoidance of the host immune system (Obergfell & Seifert, 2015). The two genes that showed the fewest exchanges, hrcC and hrcT, encode highly conserved proteins located in the basal structure of the secretion system and embedded in the bacterial envelope. Within each gene, allelic polymorphism is mostly generated by mutation, except for hrcJ and hrcV (Figure 3b). The study of genomic environment of the T3SS allowed us to distinguish two mechanisms of HGT: acquisition of a new cluster in a different chromosomal context as previously discussed and homologous recombination within T3SS cluster. One homologous recombination event leading to entire T3SS cluster replacement was shown between X. arboricola pv. guizotiae and the phylogenetically distant strains CFBP 7912 and Nyagatare. Interestingly, all these strains originated from south\u2010east Africa and were isolated from two crops (Niger seed and bean) used in mixed crop\u2010livestock farming systems and as intercrops in maize production (Abera, Feyisa, & Friesen, 2009), making their co\u2010occurrence plausible. Beside this single whole Hrp2 cluster replacement, numerous localized homologous recombination events between strains of different species have perturbed the vertical inheritance signal. Similarly, conflicts between phylogenies of some hrp/hrc genes and of housekeeping genes were observed in pseudomonads and enterobacterial plant pathogens (Sarris et al., 2013; Tegli, Gori, Cerboneschi, Cipriani, & Sisto, 2011) and a HGT event expanding through several hrp genes was previously suggested in pseudomonads (Sarris et al., 2013).",

This suggests that commensal strains are found in sympatry with a large number of different Xanthomonas species because genetic material exchanges can only take place when individuals colonize the same niche. X. dyei and X. arboricola strains were isolated from the endemic species Dysoxylum spectabile in New Zealand (Young, Wilkie, Park, & Watson, 2010). These observations reinforce the hypothesis proposed by Merda et al. (2016) that the commensal strains in X. arboricola are generalist organisms colonizing many different plants. In contrast, no gene flow at T3SS locus occurred between clade B strains and other clades. Divergent evolution of the T3SS cluster in this clade may have led to an optimized allelic combination. This result reinforces the major role of T3SS in this important clade of devastating host specialized pathogens within which the presence of the T3SS is conserved.",

Their conserved genomic environments, when compared to strains with T3SSs, suggest that they are remnants of an ancestral T3E repertoire (Fig. S4) (Merda et al., 2016). A recent loss of the T3SS could explain why the T3Es were present despite the lack of the T3SS.

Five of the seven core T3E genes were located in the T3SS cluster as previously observed in other Xanthomonas species (Noel, Thieme, Nennstiel, & Bonas, 2002; Potnis et al., 2011; da Silva et al., 2002; Teper et al., 2016). Among them, XopA, HpaA and HrpW should be better considered as accessory or translocation proteins that help the translocation process (Lorenz et al., 2008; Roux et al., 2015; White et al., 2009). Taking this into account, the X. arboricola core effectome comprises only four T3E genes (xopF1, xopM, avrBs2 and xopR) and is comparable in size to that of X. campestris (Roux et al., 2015). Together, these results challenge the list of ten core T3E genes (avrBs2, xopF1, xopK, xopL, xopN, xopP, xopQ, xopR, xopX, xopZ) previously proposed (Ryan et al., 2011; White et al., 2009). xopM, missing in this list, was recently shown to be a T3E gene of Xanthomonas euvesicatoria strain 85\u201010 (Schulze et al., 2012; Teper et al., 2016). Our BLASTp searches showed that it is present in most group 2 Xanthomonas species (data not shown). Considering that xopR and avrBs2 were missing in only one and two strains, respectively, of 13 Xanthomonas campestris (Roux et al., 2015), we propose a list of four putative core Xanthomonas T3Es: AvrBs2, XopF1, XopM and XopR. Interestingly, AvrBs2 contributes to bacterial fitness in field conditions, including epiphytic survival (Wichmann & Bergelson, 2004). It is required for full aggressiveness both in dicots and monocots and was shown to inhibit pathogen\u2010associated molecular pattern\u2010triggered immune (PTI) responses in rice (Li et al., 2015; Zhao, Dahlbeck, Krasileva, Fong, & Staskawicz, 2011). Similarly, XopM inhibits immunity\u2010associated cell death mediated by MAP kinase cascades (Teper, Sunitha, Martin, & Sessa, 2015) and XopR inhibits plant basal defences (Akimoto\u2010Tomiyama et al., 2012).",

At the basal steps of pathogen emergence, accumulation of numerous T3Es including XopL, XopN, XopQ, XopX and XopZ occurred. These were shown to target PTI in addition to the ancestral T3Es, which are also involved in PTI suppression.

During radiation, most species retained this ancestral T3SS, but some lost it and subsequently it was re\u2010acquired in some strains. Mutation is the main evolutionary force generating new hrc/hrp alleles. In group 2, Xanthomonas, the inter\u2010 and intraspecies homologous recombination of large fragments expanding through one or more genes shuffles this polymorphism generating new allelic combinations in Hrp2 clusters. A set of four ancestral core T3E genes is found in commensal strains and pathogens in X. arboricola that may approximate the Xanthomonas ancestral core effectome. We propose that these may allow the strains to overcome basal plant immunity under specific environmental conditions, but could have a fitness cost explaining why they were lost in some strains. In contrast, some strains experienced a different evolutionary pathway with stepwise accumulation of T3Es that probably accounts for their efficacy to overcome plant immunity and could explain the high aggressiveness. X. arboricola represents the archetype of this evolutionary scenario, which seems to share similarities with the one proposed for P. syringae (Lindeberg et al., 2012) and culminates in a narrow host range.",
