After a period of stability, change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), or fraction of delivered oxygen (FiO2) constitutes a VAE. Under the VAE surveillance tool are three nested tiers. A ventilator-associated condition (VAC) comprises the first tier and includes all patients with clinically significant pulmonary complications, irrespective of whether inflammation or infection may be the contributing factors. The second tier, infection-related ventilated-associated complications (IVAC), is reached when VAC criteria are met in addition to signs of leukocytosis, abnormal temperature, and commencement of antimicrobials. Progression to the third tier occurs when evidence exists of a pulmonary source of infection and is called probable or possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP) (Supplementary Figure 1) [1].",

            "text": "This single-center retrospective cohort study has some strengths and limitations. Since the overall rates of VAE were small, it precluded any analysis of patients with specific clinical conditions. However, the retrospective design reduces the possibility of manipulating ventilator settings to evade VAE diagnosis, which has been a concern regarding the validity of VAE rates in other studies [30]. If patients were maintained on higher levels of FiO2 than physiologically necessary, this could have potentially masked VAEs that would have met criteria by an increase in FiO2, making our results more significant despite this handicap. Due to the small sample size of VAE, we were unable to examine the association between patient characteristics and the development of VAE. Finally, the incidence of VAE based on diagnosis was derived from small numbers of actual VAE events for many diagnoses. These incidences should be used with caution until they can be further validated in larger studies.",
