The small intestine is the longest section of the digestive tube and consists of three segments forming a passage from the pylorus to the large intestine: Duodenum, Jejunum (considered to be roughly 40% of the small gut in human, but closer to 90% in animals) and Ileum. The total length of the small intestine is roughly 6 m in humans. Although precise boundaries between these three segments of bowel are not observed grossly or microscopically, there are histological differences among them (Tortora and Derrickson, 2008).",

The challenge is to allow efficient transport of nutrients across the epithelium while rigorously excluding passage of harmful molecules and pathogens. This is a complex and dynamic process including both transcellular and paracellular pathways (Balimane et al., 2000). The structure of the mucosa is defined by sheets of epithelial cells (Fig. 1\n) (Cheng and Leblond, 1974), connected laterally by tight junctions, which regulate the paracellular spaces and thereby establish the tight epithelia (Yu and Yang, 2009). Integrity of epithelia is critical since toxins and microorganisms that are able to breach the single layer of epithelial cells have unimpeded access to the systemic circulation (Schierack et al., 2006).",

A key role in the maintenance of an adequate balance between antigenic stimulation and host immune response is played by the immunoregulatory molecules released by activated immunocytes in the human gut but the influence of intestinal epithelial cells in the regulation of the associated mucosal immune system still remains unclear (Biancone et al., 2002, Zoumpopoulou et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The human gut is home to a complex community of microbes (the microbiota) that plays a critical role in host nutrient acquisition and metabolism, development of intestinal epithelial cells and host immune system. Recent reports show a systematic environment of the microbial diversity in the human gut of more than 1000 different species-level phylogenetic types (Andoh et al., 2009, Hart et al., 2002). Genetic background, nutritional status, and environmental factors influence the structure and function of the gut microbiota. Microbes actively communicate between themselves and with the host by releasing peptides that resemble peptide hormones of vertebrates, possibly influencing host cell function (Hsiao et al., 2008). Commensal microbes influence the epithelial differentiation and affect the underlying mucous immune system (Falk et al., 1998). Gut bacteria play an essential role in the development and homeostasis of the immune system. Moreover, colonisation by the microbiota plays an important role in intestinal tract maturation of newborn, it protects against infectious aggression and provides the body with essential nutrients (Gupta and Garg, 2009). Microbiota colonisation can be modulated by probiotics (live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amount confer a health benefit on the host (FAO/WHO, 2002)), prebiotics (non-digestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and/or activity of bacteria) or synbiotics (combination of probiotics and prebiotics). However, human data are limited and more experimental and controlled clinical trials must be carried out for a more precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying the probiotic action and the balance of the complex gastrointestinal ecosystem with which probiotics are expected to interact (Penna et al., 2008).",

Several experimental (mainly animal) models have been employed and subsequent clinical studies were performed when applicable. Germ-free mice were widely used as in vivo experimental system to study the colonisation and defining its underlying mechanisms (Falk et al., 1998). Although this system offers a good model for such studies, it has major disadvantages: 1) it is not in accordance with the spirit of reduced animal use for research purposes and animal welfare, 2) it is not suitable for wide laboratory testing, as special facilities and special trained personnel are needed, 3) it is expensive and time consuming to obtain results in comparison with good in vitro studies and 4) it is not always possible to create a good model for human enteric pathogens as some of them cannot infect the rodents gut epithelia (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes). There is also scientific criticism as animal and human models failed to develop a mechanistic approach. Indeed, in the study of Cao et al., it was found that a rat model could not be used to predict drug metabolism and oral bioavailability in humans based on the underlying molecular mechanisms (Cao et al., 2006). Moreover, results obtained in such models were difficult to reproduce, were not clearly linked to clinical outcomes and were outside any physiology of host (Clancy, 2003, Suntharalingam et al., 2006). Pigs are widely used due to their close intestinal resemblance to humans and good likelihood of applicability of results to human (Lunney, 2007). However, animal experiments are not favoured by the EU that is eager to reduce animal experimentation.",

Localisation of protein alone can identify cells producing cytokines as well as the target cells and cells which have taken up the protein by endocytosis. mRNA detection only may mislead as some cytokines (like tumor necrosis factor) are regulated posttranscriptionally (Cappello et al., 1992). Primary cells, isolated from human or animal tissue, retain majority of the in vivo functionality, but they survive only few days in cell culture (Marian, 2002, Moue et al., 2008, Niku et al., 2006, Panja, 2000, Quaroni and Beaulieu, 1997, Whitehead et al., 1993).

Primary epithelial cells in vivo develop a tightly packed selectively permeable membrane with measurable transepithelial resistance (R\nT, also abbreviated as TER) and V\nT (transepithelial potential difference); in vitro epithelial cells that polarise should develop these features when grown on microporous membrane. Epithelial cells in combination with other cell lines (if applied in the model) should respond to environmental factors like cytokines and inflammatory molecules. Moreover, the origin of the cell lines is important since cancerogenic cells have different glycosylation (Brooks et al., 2008), their proliferation and behaviour under environmental stimuli can be significantly altered. Characterization of cell markers, receptors and expression of functionally important proteins is also important for the elucidation of cell line functionality and determination of the differentiation or activation status. Based upon this information, models can be built to study particular situations. Secretion of mucins from epithelial cells helps to distinguish mucin producing cells from normal enterocytes. Cytokeratins are characteristic epithelial cytoskeletel proteins and are involved in infections by pathogens (Carlson et al., 2002). Alkaline phosphatase is involved in epithelial cell differentiation (Wood et al., 2003) and maintanance of gut barrier (Geddes and Philpott, 2008).",

            "text": "Among commercially available cell lines (ATCC and ECACC), most widely used are definitely human cancer Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 (Fig. 3a) (colon adenocarcinoma) were isolated from a 72-year old Caucasian male. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were found to express characteristics of enterocytic differentiation and functionality (Cui et al., 2009, Jalal et al., 1992, Lee et al., 2009, Schnabl et al., 2009, Uchida et al., 2009, Visco et al., 2009). Another human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 was isolated in 1964 from the colon tumor of a 44-year old Caucasian female. Ultrastructural features reported for HT-29 cells include microvilli, microfilaments, large vacuolated mitochondria with dark granules, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum with free ribosomes, lipid droplets, few primary and many secondary lysosomes. The cells express urokinase receptors, but do not have detectable plasminogen activator activity (Chen et al., 1987, Didier et al., 1996, Takahashi et al., 1996). The human cell line: Intestine 407 was originally thought to be derived from normal female embryonic intestinal tissue, but was subsequently found, based on isoenzyme analysis, HeLa marker chromosomes and DNA fingerprinting to have been established via HeLa cell contamination. The cells are positive for keratin by immunoperoxidase staining and cells contain human papilloma virus (HPV-18) (Henle and Deinhardt, 1957, Lavappa et al., 1976). Then, from a 40-year old woman with epithelioid carcinoma of metastatic cervix cancer, CaSki cells were isolated from a metastasis in the small intestine. The cells secrete beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); tumor associated antigen (Baker et al., 1987, Hussa et al., 1986, Pattillo et al., 1977). Although the cell line has been widely used in experiments, it does not derive from the small intestine, it has a tumorigenic phenotype distinguished from the normal gut epithelia and it expresses modified surface glycoconjugates (Tremblay et al., 2006). The most widely used rodent lines are the commercially available rat IEC-6 and IEC-18 cell lines, derived from the rat small intestine (Quaroni and Isselbacher, 1981, Quaroni et al., 1978). The normal human crypt small intestinal cells HIEC-6 (Fig. 3b) were isolated in the group of Beaulieu at the University of Sherbrooke, Canada (Beaulieu, 1997, Beaulieu, 1999, Belanger and Beaulieu, 2000, Lussier et al., 2000, Pageot et al., 2000). These cells have been widely used in integrin and extracellular matrix research, but are not fully characterised (Benoit et al., 2009, Dydensborg et al., 2009, Levy et al., 2009). Human foetal small intestinal cell line H4 (Fig. 3c) was established by Walker and colleagues (Nanthakumar et al., 2000) and represents the normal enterocytes of immature human intestine (Claud et al., 2003, Lu et al., 2008, Lu et al., 2009). H4 cell line was subsequently subcloned in our laboratory to obtain pure epithelial cells capable of transepithelial resistance and voltage formation. The IPEC-J2 cell line (Fig. 3d) is a non-transformed intestinal cell line originally derived from jejunal epithelia isolated from a neonatal, unsuckled piglet, maintained as a continuous culture (Berschneider, 1989) and characterised (Schierack et al., 2006). The IPEC-J2 cell line was subcloned in our laboratory to obtain cultures of enterocyte like (Fig. 3e) and mucin producing cell types (Fig. 3f).",

Below the microporous membrane (basolateral side) epithelial cells are underlaid with immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells), mimicking mucosal lymphoid tissue.

            "text": "Industry-based consensus workshops have agreed criteria for the selection and assessment of probiotic lactic bacteria without any defined mechanistic framework (Clancy, 2003). Nevertheless, one of the most important criteria that a probiotic candidate should fulfil is to colonise the host gut enabling biological effects (Dunne et al., 1999, Edwards and Parrett, 2002, Falagas et al., 2008, Gibson et al., 2005, Myllyluoma et al., 2008, Parkes et al., 2009). Initial binding of bacteria is often mediated through the recognition of sugar moieties of the intestinal cell surface, including glycolipids and glycoproteins, as shown for Lactobacilli (Cencic; article in preparation; Cencic and Jakobsen, 2002) and for Bifidobacteria (He et al., 2001). Despite widespread use, Caco-2 and HT-29 are tumorigenic cell lines and are far from being a perfect in vitro model for studying the colonisation ability and mechanisms of probiotics\u2013host interactions since they possess mixed large and small bowel phenotype. An important characteristic of epithelial cells is the development of apical and basolateral membrane with different structural and functional characteristics. It became clear 25 years ago that cancer cells have different sugar composition on the cell surface than do normal cells (Hakomori, 1996) thus, intestinal cancerogenic cells, express higher amount of sialic-reach carbohydrates (like sialyl Lewis X carbohydrate) than do normal cells (Alper, 2003). Therefore, it is important to note that results of attachment ability of probiotic bacteria to epithelial cells cultivated as monolayers on plastic surfaces do not give relevant data on adhesion ability in vivo. For example, in Caco-2 model where cells were grown on plastic surfaces, the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) or Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota was found to adhere with low capacity while for example in the normal intestinal functional cell model the same strain was found to bind almost to 50% (Jacobsen et al., 1999, Nissen et al., 2009, Roselli et al., 2006). The significant difference is found also where the adhesion assay was performed in the one dimension monolayer and functional cell model of IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 4). The knowledge of adhesion ability and relevant receptors for probiotic/protective cultures is of utmost importance especially for industrial applications where combination of strains was used, as individual strains may compete for the same receptor and the activity would be diminished rather than enhanced and vice versa (Botic et al., 2007, Cencic et al., 2007b, Collado et al., 2005, Collado et al., 2008, Collado et al., 2006, Corr et al., 2009, Gueimonde et al., 2007, Ivec et al., 2007, Li et al., 2008, Mountzouris et al., 2009, Wine et al., 2009).",

Immune effects of probiotics in humans include the stimulation of cell-mediated immune effector functions with enhanced secretion of IFN-gamma by blood cells, enhanced phagocytosis and cell activation (Clancy, 2003). A relationship between the normal flora and the host immune system exists with a mutual dependency between the two. Successful coexistence with a complex microflora presents a particular challenge to the immune system of the host (Hart et al., 2002).

Epithelial cells in pig intestinal cell model were tested for susceptibility to virus infection using rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). PSI cell line was susceptible to infection with rotavirus, TGEV and in a weaker extent to the HEV. CLAB was susceptible to all porcine viruses used in the experiments. To our knowledge, we were the first to succeed in efficient propagation of HEV in intestinal cell cultures (Fig. 7\n). Preliminary tests are in progress to define the conditions that will allow high rate propagation of several strains of HEV in pig cell cultures. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), strain Ljubljana was also shown to efficiently propagate in the pig intestinal and macrophage cells (Fig. 8\n). By using anti TBEV hyperimmune serum we were able to detect the virus infected cells 3\u20135 days post inoculation (Cencic and Avsic-Zupanc, 2009, Cencic et al., 2008a, Cencic et al., 2008b).",

For example: animal toxicity studies of Bacillus probiotic strains to date have found no evident toxicity in lower animals such as mice, guinea pigs and occasionally piglets (Duc le et al., 2004, Hong et al., 2005, Sorokulova et al., 2008). However, as stated above the need for testing in a more biologically relevant intestinal model remains since information on whether these animal species are able to develop diarrhea in response to ingestion of a known enterotoxic B. cereus remains unknown. Currently, the safety of probiotics containing spores of Bacillus species to date relies on tests to exclude the presence of enterotoxin genes or to demonstrate low titre production in laboratory cultures of the vegetative organisms using cell cytotoxicity or ELISA kits against particular enterotoxin proteins, combined with an absence of significant problems reported in the scientific literature. The need for an appropriate cell culture model for assessing the enterotoxicity of these organisms which has been validated in animal tests remains paramount. A reliable and validated intestinal cell model for testing the potential toxicity of the probiotic/protective strains has yet to be described. In vitro testing for cytotoxicity and adherence to the pig and human intestinal epithelia is currently carried out in our laboratory under the umbrella of SAFEFOODERA \u2014 Probiosafe project to determine if such assays correlate with the clinical findings in the pig model.",
