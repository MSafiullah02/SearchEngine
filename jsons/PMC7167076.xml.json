A positive maternal history has been linked to a higher risk of IHPS in infants [Carter and Evans, 1969; Panteli, 2009]. The only noteworthy difference with other series is the lack of a seasonal pattern of IHPS in the patients in the present study [Webb et al., 1983].

The main potential contributing factors are maternal treatment in early pregnancy with an anti\u2010emetic [Aselton et al., 1984] or macrolide [S\u00f8rensen et al., 2003], pyloric muscle defects, such as smooth muscle cells [Guarino et al., 2000], increased growth factor expression [Jab\u0142o\u0144ski et al., 2006], abnormal distribution and organization of extracellular matrix proteins [Oue and Puri, 1999], defective pyloric innervation [Kobayashi et al., 2001], absence or rarity of interstitial cells of Cajal [Vanderwinden et al., 1996], and low nitric oxide synthase expression in fibers innervating the pyloric circular muscle, leading to decreased plasma nitrile levels [Huang et al., 2006]. However, to our knowledge, the only microbial pathogens to have been sought in this setting are Helicobacter pylori [Dahshan et al., 2006; Sherwood et al., 2007] and Epstein\u2013Barr virus [Jenson et al., 2001]. H. pylori antigens were not detected by an enzyme immunoassay technique in series of 39 stool specimens from children with IHPS [Sherwood et al., 2007]. A recent study of gastric biopsies from 16 patients showed three cases of chronic active gastritis and six cases of mild focal gastritis [Dahshan et al., 2006]. However, histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining revealed no bacteria, and the urease test was negative in all samples. Jenson et al. [2001] failed to detect EBV in smooth muscle cells from 10 patients with IHPS diagnosed clinically and histopathologically, by means of in situ hybridization of EBV\u2010encoded RNA1 (EBER1).",

The case in which an enterovirus was detected by RT\u2010PCR in a vomit sample which was negative by cell culture could be explained either by a small inoculum or by a non\u2010culturable enterovirus. After oral infection, enteroviruses multiply with the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosae, leading to abundant orofecal excretion of virions. Our case of PCR positivity was therefore probably fortuitous, especially as asymptomatic enterovirus infection is frequent in newborns [Tebruegge and Curtis, 2009]. Likewise, detection of an ADV 3 strain in the stools of one of the patients does not by itself suggest a role in IHPS, as ADV can be excreted for very long periods in the stools of newborns with no other signs of infection [Madeley, 1979]. This finding also appears to be incidental, although strains of serotype 3 can cause frequently fatal disseminated disease in previously healthy children [Munoz et al., 1998]. Thus, the negative results of all virological investigations of pyloric samples from the patients exclude the involvement of the viruses examined.",
