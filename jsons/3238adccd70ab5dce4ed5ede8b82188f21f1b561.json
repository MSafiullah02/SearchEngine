Spontaneous breathing may offer multiple physiologic benefits in these patients, including decreased need for sedation, preserved diaphragm activity and improved cardiovascular function. However, excessive effort to breathe due to high respiratory drive may lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI), even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. In the present review, we focus on the physiological and clinical implications of control of respiratory drive in ARDS patients. We summarize the main determinants of neural respiratory drive and the mechanisms involved in its potentiation, in health and ARDS. We also describe potential and pitfalls of the available bedside methods for drive assessment and explore classical and more \"futuristic\" interventions to control drive in ARDS patients.",

Systemic Fig. 1 Metabolic hyperbola, brain and ventilation curves in health and ARDS. The metabolic hyperbola is the relationship between ventilation and the resultant PaCO 2 for a given level of metabolic CO 2 production and dead space. Increased dead space or CO 2 production will shift the hyperbola up. The ventilation curve describes the actual effect of changing PaCO 2 on resultant minute ventilation. ARDS can shift the ventilation curve to the right (lower minute ventilation despite higher PaCO 2 ) due to increased respiratory load and muscle weakness. Finally, the brain curve (also known as the \"controller curve\", \"CO 2 sensitivity curve\" or \"ventilation gain curve\") describes the minute ventilation theoretically requested by the neural respiratory drive for a given PaCO 2 . During ARDS, this is shifted to the left (higher minute ventilation despite lower PaCO 2 ) due to multiple concomitant pathologic conditions, including acidosis, inflammation and others. a In health, brain and ventilation curves overlap and the ventilation response (i.e., the change in minute ventilation induced by a change in PaCO 2 ) reflects the neural respiratory drive. The metabolic hyperbola is obtained assuming a dead space of 0.3 and a metabolic CO 2 production (VCO 2 ) of 200 ml/min. Brain and ventilation curves are overlapping and are calculated assuming at PaCO 2 of 39.5 mmHg, a ventilation of 6.5 l/min, linearly increasing to 30 l/min at a PaCO 2 of 49 mmHg. b In ARDS, the metabolic hyperbola is shifted upward due to increase of dead space (0.5) and VCO 2 (250 ml/min). The listed factors cause the brain and ventilation curves to be shifted in opposite directions and diverge. Please, note that a single ARDS patient will be characterized by both curves at the same time: the brain curve will correspond to the theoretical ventilation/PaCO 2 correlation desired by the neural respiratory drive, while the ventilation curve will be the actual ventilation/PaCO 2 correlation measured by spirometer and blood gas analysis. Brain and ventilation curves are calculated assuming a ventilation of 6.5 l/min at 28 mmHg PaCO 2 (increasing to 30 l/min at 33 mmHg PaCO 2 ) and a ventilation of 5 l/min at 40 mmHg PaCO 2 (increasing to 25 l/min at 52 mmHg PaCO 2 ), respectively inflammation is common and extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction frequently develops (Fig. 2) . Impairment of gas exchange leads to an increase in chemosensory input. Increase in PaCO 2 , promoted by high dead space, induces a linear increase in respiratory drive through both central and peripheral chemoreceptors [14, 15] . On the other hand, the ventilatory response following severe hypoxemia typical of ARDS is not linear but hyperbolic [11] . Peripheral chemoreceptors, which are relatively insensitive at mild hypoxemia, increase the neural respiratory drive in response to more severe hypoxemia, mainly by enhancing the ventilatory response to CO 2 when the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) falls below 60-70 mmHg. This effect can be potentiated by concomitant hypercapnia. Metabolic acidosis, which frequently complicates ARDS because of shock or acute kidney injury, stimulates both peripheral and central chemoreceptors [16] .",

Hypoxic ventilatory response is also exaggerated due to a sensitization of peripheral chemoreceptors [17] . Local and systemic inflammation are hallmarks of ARDS [18] , and pulmonary C-fibers sensitive to inflammatory mediators (including histamine, bradykinin and prostaglandins) are consistently activated in lung edema [19] and experimental acute lung injury [20] . Vagal afferents from these lung chemoreceptors can modulate the breathing pattern through a central reflex pathway [21] . The consequence of vagal activation is an increase in respiratory rate with a decrease in tidal volume, i.e., rapid shallow breathing [22, 23] , possibly through vagally mediated release of cytokines in the brainstem [24] .",

The figure shows the key triggers of respiratory drive and the anatomic targets where these triggers exert their effects. In the centre, the descending cascade from neural respiratory drive to breathing effort and lung stress is represented, together with the main factors that may cause a dissociation between drive and effort (i.e., muscle function) and between drive, effort and lung stress (i.e., neuromechanical coupling and respiratory mechanics) rats (for example during the Hering-Breuer reflex), terminating inspiration. Although the Hering-Breuer reflex might be inhibited by the behavioural control of breathing in awake humans [25] , decreased inhibitory input from these mechanoreceptors in the atelectatic lung could promote a further increase in inspiratory effort in ARDS. Indeed, the activation of mechanoreceptors appears to decrease as ARDS develops [20] , while it is increased by increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [26] , probably through stabilized lung recruitment. This could be one of the mechanisms by which high PEEP decreases spontaneous respiratory effort in ARDS [27] . Stimulation of the respiratory centres through each of these mechanisms increases the slopeand shift to the left-of the brain curve. Decreases in lung and chest wall compliance increase the elastic load and can alter the neuro-mechanical coupling between effort and diaphragmatic excursion. The result is a decreased slope of the ventilation curve and an increase in PaCO 2 , which induces a stimulation of neural respiratory drive and a dissociation between brain and ventilation curves (Fig. 3) .",

The alterations in neuromuscular function (muscle weakness) and respiratory mechanics (atelectasis and increased lung and chest wall elastance) generate a discrepancy between the activity of the respiratory centres Fig. 3 Potential dissociation between neural respiratory drive (P 0.1 ) and respiratory effort (P es ) under pathologic conditions. The figure shows simulated identical waveforms for airway pressure (P aw ) during supported breaths but with different simulated oesophageal pressure (P es ) waveforms. P 0.1 (i.e., the negative airway pressure generated by occlusion occurring during the first 0.1 s of an inspiration) reflects the intensity of neural respiratory drive. Oesophageal pressure swings (\u0394P es ) allow quantification of respiratory effort. However, in patients with high chest wall elastance, \u0394P es underestimates effort. In the presence of muscular weakness, high drive may be associated with \"normal\" or even low effort (right panel) and the resulting motor output. When the intensity of the signal from the brain to the muscles and to the lung is dampened by these alterations, the force of contraction of respiratory muscles and the changes in intrathoracic pressure, flow and volume underestimate the neural drive. Therefore, clinical surrogates of respiratory drive may be conveniently categorized according to their \"distance\" from the respiratory centres (Table 1) . First, neural output (i.e., electrical activity of the diaphragm); second, breathing effort, assessed by changes in pressure induced by the respiratory muscles (i.e., swings in pleural pressure or P 0.1 ); and, third, ventilatory response, reflected by the tidal volume and respiratory rate (breathing pattern).",

Eadi may be recorded using an oesophageal catheter with multiple electrodes and it represents the \"closest\" surrogate of neural respiratory drive available in clinical practice [32] . Because of high interindividual variability, it is difficult to provide references for absolute values of EAdi [33] . However, trends in EAdi allow the tracking of changes in neural output in individual patients [34] . EAdi is also increased in the presence of low muscle strength [35] and the ratio of actual EAdi to maximum EAdi measured during an occlusion may provide an accurate estimate of the patient neural respiratory drive and effort to breathe [33] . The ratio between tidal volume (V t ) and EAdi represents the neuroventilatory efficiency of the diaphragm [36] : a low V t /EAdi ratio, either due to diaphragm dysfunction or to compromised respiratory mechanics, indicates dissociation between neural respiratory drive and ventilatory response. EAdi monitoring only assesses the activity of the diaphragm. However, recruitment of accessory inspiratory [37] and expiratory [38, 39] muscles is a strong indicator of increased neural respiratory drive due to a mismatch between the respiratory load and the muscle capacity with decreased expiratory time. Surface electromyography of extra-diaphragmatic respiratory muscles could, therefore, integrate the EAdi for a complete assessment of neural respiratory drive [40] .",

In healthy subjects, increases in ventilatory demand are met by initial increases in V t with constant inspiratory time (T i ), resulting in high mean inspiratory flow (V t /T i ), that reflects high drive [48] [49] [50] . Similarly, high V t (and high V t /T i ) in spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS suggest dangerous increases in respiratory drive both during noninvasive [51] and invasive mechanical ventilation [52] . Increased respiratory rate occurs only when respiratory drive is three to four times higher than normal and it is detected by an increased ratio of T i and total breath duration (T i /T tot ) [49, 50] . However, decreased respiratory compliance [53] and muscular weakness may limit the increase in V t in ARDS [54] . Increased neural respiratory drive could then lead to early increases in respiratory rate with decreased T i [55] and the rapid shallow breathing index (respiratory rate divided by tidal volume) [56] might indicate high drive with unsatisfied ventilatory demand.",

Dyspnea results from the imbalance between load and muscle capacity or from the imbalance between motor output and lung expansion [59] . The complex neural network involved in dyspnea receives afferent information on the respiratory motor output from the brainstem and the motor cortex [60] , as well as multiple sensory feedbacks from the chemoreceptors and the mechanoreceptors of the lung and chest wall [61] . The perception of dyspnea depends on the integration of this motor and sensory information, modulated by emotion [62] .

However, indications for preserving or restoring spontaneous breathing in patients with ARDS are still controversial because, if respiratory drive is not controlled and causes vigorous spontaneous breathing efforts, this worsens lung and diaphragm injury [31, 63, 64] . The mechanisms underlying additional lung injury due to elevated efforts are multiple and complementary. High transpulmonary pressure during inspiration and large tidal volumes determine an increase in lung stress and strain. Patient-ventilator asynchronies due to high inspiratory effort such as double triggering can also lead to high tidal volume [65] . Even in the presence of protective V t and pressure, regional injury can still occur because of increased local stress in dependent atelectatic lung regions due to the solid-like behaviour of the diseased lung. In addition, decrease of pleural pressure generated by diaphragmatic contraction is larger in the dependent lung regions drawing air from non-dependent regions before ventilator flow reaches the alveoli (i.e., occult pendelluft phenomenon) [66] . Distribution of tidal volume within the lungs is usually more homogenous during spontaneous breathing as compared to controlled ventilation, but too high effort can lead to ventilation heterogeneity with a larger portion of tidal volumes reaching dependent regions. The increased negative pleural pressure during forceful breathing effort also increases transmural vascular pressure, which promotes additional pulmonary oedema due to increased lung perfusion and lower alveolar pressure [67] .",

High respiratory drive might be considered \"appropriate\" when the activating stimulus can be corrected by increased ventilatory response. This is the case for hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Increased ventilation is the physiologic response aimed at correcting these alterations. Conversely, several stimuli that increase the activity of respiratory centres in ARDS are not modified by the ventilation feedback. For example, inflammation, pain and anxiety induce an \"inappropriate\" high respiratory drive. In the case of an appropriate high neural respiratory drive, the treatment should facilitate the ventilatory response (for example by increasing ventilatory support); on the other hand, inappropriate high drive requires a specific treatment (for example medications for anxiolysis). In the context of ARDS, the effects on the lung should always be monitored and high respiratory drive, either appropriate or inappropriate, should be controlled if it results in the generation of excessive lung stress with consequent increased in the risk of P-SILI.",

When the ventilatory response corresponds to the neural respiratory drive, controlling drive is crucial to ensure lung protection. On the other hand, in the presence of a large dissociation between the brain and ventilation curves, lung protection could be maintained even in the presence of increased neural respiratory drive; however, adjusting settings to decrease this dissociation could have additional benefits like improving dyspnea and preventing abnormal breathing patterns (e.g., rapid shallow breathing).",

Potential mechanisms of benefit include unloading of the respiratory muscles, improved mechanics and better oxygenation. Oppositely, the drive increases when the ventilator support is reduced. However, unprotective levels of ventilation should not be tolerated in order to comply with the patient respiratory drive during PSV: switching back to controlled ventilation might be safer when inspiratory plateau pressure is higher than 30 cmH 2 O, Vt greater than 6-8 ml/kg predicted body weight and high levels of FiO 2 (e.g., > 80%) are needed [58] . Alternative modes of assisted ventilation with non-fixed support proportional to diaphragm electrical activity [80] or to a desired range of work of breathing performed by the patient [81] are emerging as possibly safer alternatives to increase support without risking excessive additional lung injury. Indeed, during these modes, the drive decreases when support by the ventilator is increased, but, at the same time, the V t and inspiratory pressure increases only up to a point below safe thresholds, likely because of preserved reflexes limiting lung volumes. Finally, artificially introducing some variability within the respiratory pattern by noisy pressure support [82] or by cyclic large breaths (i.e., using \"sighs\") [83] has been shown to safely modulate increased respiratory drive, by improving oxygenation or respiratory mechanics, or through the Hering-Breuer effect, or all the above.",

Previous studies have described possible feed forward interaction between music rhythm and the breathing pattern of healthy and ICU subjects: this generates the fascinating hypothesis that music could act as a modulator of respiratory drive [93] , potentially able to override metabolic inputs by decreasing stress and anxiety and increasing comfort (i.e., decreasing the behavioural drive) [94] . ECCO 2 R decreases the amount of CO 2 that must be eliminated through the lungs: this, rather than modifying the brain neural drive, will simply move the metabolic hyperbola downward, thus reducing the actual PaCO 2 and minute ventilation level. In the case of stable subjects recovering from ARDS, in whom the slope of brain drive is less steep and the metabolic hyperbola closer to healthy subjects, the decrease of VCO 2 through the natural lung by ECCO 2 R decreases ventilation to minimal levels [95] . In the most severe patients with extremely high respiratory drive and with the metabolic hyperbola significantly shifted upward, efficacy of ventilation reduction by ECCO 2 R should be more limited, as indicated by pilot data [96] . Moreover, to date, the burden of ECCO 2 R-related complications is too high to consider the control of respiratory drive an indication for its use, in non-intubated patients with less severe ARDS. As ECCO 2 R systems become safer with advances in the technology, and the risk-to-benefit ratio improves, ECCO 2 R might become a more attractive method of controlling respiratory drive and avoiding further lung injury in patients with ARDS.",
