Despite the great diversity of these viruses in regard to structure, replicative strategy, host range and pathogenicity, the\nfunction of the lipid is the same in all of them: to form a membrane surrounding the encapsidated viral genome. In all these viruses the lipids form a continuous bilayer that functions as a permeability barrier protecting the viral nucleocapsid from the external milieu. Embedded in the bilayer are numerous copies of a limited number (usually one or two) of virally encoded transmembrane proteins that are required for virus entry into a host cell. These proteins must mediate two essential functions: attachment of the virion to the cell surface; and fusion of the viral envelope with a cell membrane.",

In these, the bilayer arrangement of the lipids has been directly demonstrated using physical methods, and the lipid composition of various viruses grown under different conditions has been described in detail. Since all of these viruses acquire their bilayer by budding through the host cell's plasma membrane, the viral membrane contains the lipids present there. Wide variations of lipid composition are tolerated, and most of the lipids display the properties characteristic of lipids in a bilayer, not those of protein-bound lipids. The precise content of each individual phospholipid or glycolipid in a viral membrane does not always reflect the bulk composition of the host cell membrane from which it was derived, however. This difference may arise from interactions of lipids with the viral membrane proteins, or from inhomogeneity in the host cell membrane.",

Transmembrane sequences are inherently insoluble in water, so that integral membrane proteins require the presence of detergents to be soluble.

The best example is the influenza virus HA protein.

Other enveloped viruses bind to different specific cell surface proteins to initiate infection. An emerging generalization is that, even when viruses bind to true cell surface receptors that normally initiate complex intracellular responses such as phosphorylation cascades, these responses are not essential for viral infectivity.

The most nonspecific of the enveloped viruses may be the rhabdoviruses, represented by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies, which bind indiscriminately to clusters of negative charges, whether created by lipids, proteins or oligosaccharides.

While the former are active at neutral pH, the latter require a more acidic environment, usually below pH 6, for fusion. This difference has profound consequences, as it reflects two distinctly different modes of viral entry (Fig. 1\n). The paramyxoviruses, and others capable of fusing at neutral pH, can fuse with the cells' plasma membranes under normal conditions, i.e. at the neutral pH of extracellular fluid or culture medium (Fig. 1B,G). Those viruses that fuse only at acidic pH, on the other hand, must first be internalized from the cell surface into specialized vacuoles, the endosomes. Although this process brings the virus inside the cell, the viral genome is still separated from the cell cytoplasm by the same two membranes as before. The endosomes are acidic, however, which activates the viral fusion protein and allows fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes (Fig. 1C\u2013G). The pH dependence of viral fusion activity, which is conveniently measured as virus-induced hemolysis, or by a variety of direct fusion assays, serves to distinguish between viruses that enter the cell by the two distinct routes shown in Fig. 1\nFigure 1.",

In the last few years considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular events that occur during viral fusion.\nFusion mediated by the influenza fusion protein, HA, has been the most thoroughly studied and is the best understood, since the three-dimensional structure of its proteolytically derived extracellular portion has been determined by x-ray crystallography.\nThe fusion-competent form of HA arises from proteolytic cleavage of an inactive precursor, HA0, to yield HA1 and HA2. The single transmembrane domain is in HA2, to which HA1 is attached by disulfide bonds. HA1 is primarily concerned with cell attachment, while HA2 chiefly mediates the fusion reaction, which relies on three structural features of the molecule:1.\nThe fusion peptide, situated at the N-terminus of HA002. This hydrophobic sequence was recognized early as a conserved feature between influenza and paramyxovirus fusion proteins. Its release from constraint by the proteolytic cleavage that creates HA2 is an essential element in the proteolytic activation of HA.2.\nThe three-stranded coiled-coil that comprises the stem of the HA trimer at neutral pH. The low pH-mediated activation of HA for fusion consists of a rearrangement and extension of this coiled-coil. This repositions the fusion peptide, from a sequestered location close to the viral membrane to an exposed position at the extreme end of the newly elongated coil. This enables the fusion peptide to contact and penetrate the target membrane (Fig. 2\n).3.\nThe transmembrane domain of HA002. An essential role of this domain was demonstrated through the use of a mutant from which it had been deleted. When the entire external portion of HA was anchored through a lipid only into the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, it was no longer capable of mediating fusion. However, it could still catalyze half the reaction, or hemifusion, a process in which only the outer leaflets of the two membrane bilayers become mixed.\n",

For influenza HA this is induced by acid, and consists of the extension of the coiled-coil stalk and exposure of the fusion peptide Fig. 2\nFigure 2). For fusion proteins that act at neutral pH, other activation processes operate. Some paramyxovirus fusion proteins (named F) may be activated by interaction with a partner viral protein, the cell attachment protein HN. For the HIV-1 fusion protein, activation is thought to occur by interaction with one of several chemokine receptors present on the surface of host cells (part of step 1, Fig. 3).2.\nPenetration of the fusion peptide into the target bilayer, thus linking the viral bilayer with the target bilayer (step 1, Fig. 3).3.\nRelocation of the extended coiled coil stem so as to bring the two linked membranes into close apposition (part of step 3, Fig. 3).4.\nHemifusion between the outer leaflets of the viral membrane and the target membrane. This may be mediated by the fusion peptide. Hemifusion is initiated by formation of a stalk, a lipid structure of very high negative curvature that provides continuity between the two outer leaflets. Mixing of outer leaflet lipids, but not those of the inner leaflet, characterizes hemifusion (step 3, Fig. 3).5.\nFormation of fusion pores. The transition from the structure present in the hemifused state (the hemifusion diaphragm, a small area consisting of a single bilayer composed of the inner leaflets of the two reacting membranes; Fig. 3) to the fusion pore is energetically favorable. This transition requires participation of the transmembrane domain of the viral fusion protein (step 4, Fig. 3).6.\nEnlargement of the fusion pore. Initially, fusion pores allow only flickering electrical contact between the aqueous compartments. The pore eventually widens out to permit transfer of the viral genome or other large molecules, thus completing the fusion process (step 5, Fig. 3).\n",

Hence, viral protein synthesis is carried out on host cell ribosomes. Synthesis of viral membrane proteins occurs on membrane-bound ribosomes, from which they are inserted, always in the correct orientation, into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. There they are glycosylated and assembled into multimeric form. The influenza HA protein, for example, is assembled into the trimers that form the \u2018spikes\u2019 seen in electron micrographs of the surface of influenza virions. The viral glycoproteins may then be further processed through the Golgi and on to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4\n). In fact, the membrane proteins of VSV, influenza, and several other enveloped viruses have provided valuable tools for the study of these transport processes. This is because many of these viruses possess only one major membrane protein, which is expressed in infected cells at very high levels. Further, host cell protein synthesis is inhibited by both VSV and influenza infection, so large amounts of a single membrane protein are produced and correctly processed in infected cells.",

Newly synthesized influenza HA protein, on the other hand, is delivered to the apical plasma membranes of the same polarized cells. Similarly, the retention of coronavirus glycoproteins by the endoplasmic reticulum, and of bunyavirus glycoproteins by the Golgi, are thought to reflect the operation of the same cellular mechanisms that retain resident cellular proteins in these organelles.

In these cases the nucleocapsid, assembled in the cytoplasm, buds into the lumen of the appropriate organelle.

Surprisingly, this protein does not interact specifically with the corresponding viral membrane glycoproteins; in fact, successful budding has been observed in the complete absence of viral glycoproteins. This lack of specificity has made possible the creation of pseudotype viruses, possessing the encapsidated genome of one virus and the membrane glycoproteins of another. Since the membrane proteins determine host range and host cell specificity (see above), pseudotypes have proven useful in redirecting specific viral genomes to alternate host cells.",

Uncoating begins with attachment of the virion to the cell surface (A), through the binding of an integral viral membrane protein to a \u2018receptor\u2019 on the cell surface, which may be a specific cell protein, an oligosaccharide or a patch of charged lipids. Attachment is followed by fusion, mediated by a viral protein which may or may not be of the same type as the attachment protein. If the viral fusion protein is active at neutral pH, fusion can occur directly with the plasma membrane (B). Alternatively, if fusion requires an acidic pH, the virion must first be endocytosed via the coated pit\u2013coated vesicle pathway (C,D). The viral fusion protein is activated in the acidic endosomes (E,F). Both pathways result in the introduction of the viral nucleocapsid, containing the viral genome, into the cytoplasm (G). For viruses that undergo transcription and replication in the nucleus (such as orthomyxoviruses and most DNA viruses), uncoating is followed by transport of the nucleocapsid through the nuclear pores into the nucleus by unrelated processes.",
