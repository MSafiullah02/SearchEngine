Within a year, more than 8000 cases of SARS and at least 774 deaths were recorded worldwide due to the rapid transmission of the virus by aerosols and by the high mortality rate that is associated with infection.1\u20134 The SARS\u2010CoV genome was rapidly sequenced after initial identification,5, 6 and showed a close relationship to the group 2 coronaviruses.7 Although surveillance and infection\u2010control measures successfully contained the spread of SARS in humans, SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like viruses have been identified in bats as a natural reservoir of the virus.8 SARS\u2010CoV is also able to infect cats and Himalayan palm civets; this further warns of other possible routes for interspecies transmission.9 Currently, the mainstream treatment strategies of SARS involve broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics, antiviral agents and immunomodulatory therapy, but few drugs are effective against the virus.10 To improve therapeutic options, the development of a wider variety of drugs and more effective methods to combat SARS is important.",

These precursor polyproteins are processed into a range of structural and nonstructural proteins by viral cysteine proteases (PL2pro and 3CLpro).11 The SARS\u2010CoV helicase contains three major domains: a putative N\u2010terminal metal\u2010binding domain (MBD), a hinge domain and a NTPase/helicase domain. Because the SARS\u2010CoV helicase is absolutely necessary for subsequent viral replication and proliferation, it is thought to be an attractive target for new anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV drugs. Indeed, viral helicases are proven drug targets due to the success of helicase inhibitors in animal models of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and in the treatment of hepatitis C.12, 13\n",

We have observed the evolution of drug\u2010resistant strains during tests on SARS\u2010CoV by using our small molecules. Therefore, we employed an in vitro selection strategy, namely, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) to isolate DNA sequences that have a high affinity for the SARS\u2010CoV helicase.20, 21 This approach was previously reported for inhibition of HIV and SIVcpz reverse transcriptase, and was used to overcome the resistance issue.22 Although natural phosphodiester DNA or RNA aptamers are nuclease\u2010sensitive (and estimated to have a lifetime of a few minutes in blood), they can be chemically modified for stabilisation post\u2010SELEX.

This method presented a homogeneous population to the aptamer pool and coupled the selection process to facile affinity chromatography binding and elution steps; this decreases the chance of selecting contaminants. To increase the stringency of selection, excess amounts of polydeoxynucleotide (dIdC) were added to the selection buffer to eliminate nonspecifically bound aptamers. Aptamers that bind to the magnetic beads but not the protein itself were eliminated during counter\u2010selection steps by using the magnetic beads alone. Enrichment of a pool that specifically bound to the SARS\u2010CoV helicase was checked after the seventh and 15th rounds of selection, but little sequence enrichment was observed. After 20 rounds of selection, the selected oligonucleotides were subsequently amplified by PCR by using unmodified primers to allow for cloning of the aptamer pool. As a result, 26 individual aptamer clones were sequenced, and it was shown that most of the sequences were guanosine rich (Figure 2). Because G\u2010rich\u2010characteristic sequences are likely to fold into a G\u2010quadruplex structure (Figure 3 B), formation of this structure by the aptamers was predicted by bioinformatic analysis and classified into two main groups. In Figure 2 A, 17 sequences were identified that were unlikely to form a G\u2010quadruplex structure and then further grouped by multiple\u2010sequence alignment. In group A, aptamers NG1 and NG2 were similar (with only a few base variations), and NG3 had a few further differences. Among group B, high sequence homology was observed at the 3\u2032\u2010end with a highly conserved sequence (5\u2032\u2010GTTAGTGTGTT\u20103\u2032). Aptamers in group C were apparently orphan sequences that were not closely related to the other groups. In contrast to non\u2010G\u2010quadruplex\u2010forming aptamers, the G\u2010quadruplex\u2010forming aptamers had less sequence homology; this suggests that they might use a different mechanism for binding (Figure 2 B). However, a repeat pattern of GG(N)xGG, in which N is a deoxynucleotide and x is the number of repeats, appeared; this pattern is likely to fold into a G\u2010quadruplex structure. Five aptamers (NG1, NG3, NG8, G5 and G8) including representatives of each group were further characterised.",

Circular dichroism spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis were employed to investigate whether the G\u2010quadruplex structure was formed. Putative non\u2010G\u2010quadruplex aptamers NG1, NG3 and NG8 did not have guanine repeats in their sequence, and their CD spectra showed positive peaks at 280 nm (Figure 3 A). This spectrum is characteristic of the canonical B\u2010form structure.23 However, putative G\u2010quadruplex aptamers G5 and G8 have guanine\u2010rich characteristics, and their CD spectra differed from typical B\u2010form CD spectra. Aptamer G5 formed a parallel G\u2010quadruplex structure that was typified by a positive maximum peak near 265 nm and a negative peak at 240 nm.24 Aptamer G8 showed a signature of antiparallel G\u2010quadruplex structure that was characterised by a long\u2010wavelength positive maximum peak near 295 nm, similar to the previously reported thrombin\u2010binding aptamer (Figure 3 A).25 Schematic depictions of parallel and antiparallel strand orientation of the G\u2010quadruplex structures are shown in Figures 3 C and D respectively. Interestingly, no specific peaks at these wavelengths were detected when the aptamers were incubated in the presence of sodium chloride buffer (Figures 3 C and D); this is consistent with previous reports that the G\u2010quadruplex structure is more stable in the presence of potassium ions than sodium ions.26 KCl was present during aptamer selection so that the potassium\u2010bound structures are those relevant to binding to the SCV helicase.",

The oligonucleotides ran as single bands on denaturing polyacrylamide gels that contained 8 m urea with mobilities that depended on their denatured size (Figure 3 E). By native polyacrylamide gel (Figure 3 F), aptamers NG1, NG3 and NG8 and random sequence migrated as a single band; this is consistent with a lack of G\u2010quadruplex structure by CD. The thrombin\u2010binding aptamer had a smaller molecular size and therefore migrated faster. Aptamer G8 (putatively anti\u2010parallel G\u2010quadruplex and monomeric by CD) migrated as a single band by gel, whereas aptamer G5 (putatively parallel G\u2010quadruplex and multimeric by CD) migrated as two bands.

In the case of the 3\u2032\u2010inverted thymidine aptamer, the oligo remained intact for up to 72 and 31 h in 5 and 10 % FBS respectively (Figures 6 A and D).

When the enzyme meets the aptamer, the enzyme is locked in a conformation; this explains the high ATPase turnover.

Similarly to our aptamers, these RNA aptamers also only inhibited helicase activities and did not inhibit ATPase activities; this suggests that this pattern of behaviour is common to aptamers that were selected against helicase targets. The RNA aptamers do provide higher structural diversities that help inhibit with a slightly stronger IC50 than DNA aptamers against the same target.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP (0.5 mm). The change in fluorescence (excitation 550 nm, emission 570 nm) after 1 min was used to monitor the extent of unwinding of the duplex. The E. coli DnaB FRET assay was carried out with DnaB (10 \u03bcg) under the same conditions. Controls to determine the specificity by using the E. coli DnaB helicase were performed as we described previously.17 Data were fitted by using Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, USA).",
