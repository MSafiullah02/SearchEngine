            "text": "Advanced techniques in the field of diagnostic microbiology have made amazing progress over the past 25 years due largely to a technological revolution in the molecular aspects of microbiology [1, 2]. In particular, rapid molecular methods for nucleic acid amplification and characterization combined with automation in the clinical microbiology laboratory as well as user-friendly software and robust laboratory informatics systems have significantly broadened the diagnostic capabilities of modern clinical microbiology laboratories. Molecular methods such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) rapidly are being developed and introduced in the clinical laboratory setting [3, 4]. Indeed, every section of the clinical microbiology laboratory, including bacteriology, mycology, mycobacteriology, parasitology, and virology, has benefited from these advanced techniques. Because of the rapid development and adaptation of these molecular techniques, the interpretation and relevance of the results produced by such molecular methods continues to lag behind. The purpose of this chapter is to review, update, and discuss the interpretation and relevance of results produced by these advanced molecular techniques.",

For example, interpretation of DNAemia with coagulase-negative staphylococci is problematic due to a false-positive rate that ranges from 60% to 80% [10, 22]. In contrast, interpretation of DNAemia with Ehrlichia species is not a problem due to a true-positive rate of 100% [23]. Interpretation of DNAemia has also been a problem in some studies where DNAemia is detected by PCR but not by blood cultures [21]. A number of these \u201cfalse-positive\u201d PCR results have been considered clinically significant, based on either retrospective chart review or subsequent isolation of the pathogen from other relevant clinical specimens [12, 24\u201329]. Clearly, the continued clinical investigation of microbial DNAemia during sepsis and other critical illnesses is needed and will provide a better understanding of the biology of the microbial circulating DNA that underpins such molecular diagnostic techniques [12, 21, 30].",

            "text": "Another important issue for molecular diagnostic techniques is the need for molecular detection of resistance determinants [12, 21]. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recognized as important for confirming susceptibility to chosen empirical antimicrobial agents as well as for detecting resistance in individual microbial isolates [31]. Current methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing continue to be based for the most part on the detection of microbial growth or lack of growth in the presence of the antimicrobial agent being tested [32, 33]. The direct detection of resistance genes by molecular methods such as PCR or molecular probes to date has limitations due to the fact that relatively few resistance genes are firmly associated with phenotypic resistance [31\u201333]. For example, resistance genes associated with phenotypic resistance that can be found in Gram-positive cocci include mecA, vanA, and vanB. In contrast, the lack of consensus sequences among acetyltransferases and adenyltransferase genes from Gram-negative bacilli makes the molecular detection of aminoglycoside resistance difficult. Although molecular methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing are improving, phenotypic methods for determining the level of susceptibility of bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents continue to remain clinically relevant.",

            "text": "The volume of blood cultured is known to be an important variable in blood cultures because the number of microorganisms in blood may be small [34\u201336]. Typically in adults, there are fewer than 10 CFU/ml, and there may be less than 1 CFU/ml. In septic neonates, there is a sizeable subset with less than 4 CFU/ml [36]. Clearly the volume of blood tested by molecular methods will also be important [11, 16]. Moreover, the Poisson distribution of these microorganisms is such that they are not evenly distributed [37, 38]. This increases the likelihood that sampling a small volume of blood will miss a microorganism that is causing sepsis. Volume-related issues may explain the lower sensitivity seen with a molecular method (66.7%) than seen with conventional blood cultures in a study of neonatal sepsis [28]. The Poisson distribution may explain the moderate concordance between blood cultures and a molecular method reported in a study of postsurgical sepsis in adults [24].",

The best example of this is the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in sputum where the dead microbial pathogen DNA can remain un-degraded due to the fatty acid-rich cell walls [50, 51]. Unlike the results of a function-based testing method, such as mycobacterial cultures, in the clinical setting, a positive PCR result after antituberculosis therapy does not necessarily mean treatment failure. The application of mRNA-targeted NAATs has been demonstrated for monitoring of tuberculosis therapy. Anti-TB therapy regimen selection is largely empiric. Treatment may not be modified until weeks or months later as results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests become available. Because the half-life of bacterial mRNA is extremely short compared to rRNA or genomic DNA, molecular assays that target mycobacterial mRNA better reflect mycobacterial viability. The ability of mRNA-based assays to distinguish viable from nonviable organisms has demonstrated that such assays are useful in monitoring the efficacy of anti-TB therapy [50, 51].",

            "text": "There currently are a number of different molecular assays for detecting gene mutations associated with resistance to a particular antituberculosis drug [46, 52, 53]. There are always gaps between basic research and clinical application as some of the drug resistance mechanisms remain unknown, while new resistance-related mutations are emerging. In addition, all molecular assays basically include a DNA amplification step and are categorized by the manner in which the amplified DNA is detected except for sequencing, which has some distinct advantages over the other methods. None of these methods, including sequencing, are able to detect all resistant strains although sequencing comes the closest to doing so. The major limitation of these molecular methods, except sequencing, is that they detect only known mutations in a defined site or region, as their design is dependent upon known mutations. The advantage of sequencing for molecular detection of mutations of drug resistance can be seen by a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [43]. This study used DNA sequencing to detect resistance to the first-line antituberculosis drugs isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and to the second-line drugs amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. The molecular data were compared to phenotypic data. Sensitivity and specificity values for the first-line and second-line drug loci were, in general, excellent and supported the use of DNA sequencing to detect drug resistance in the M. tuberculosis complex.",

            "text": "Although uncommon, misidentification has been reported with molecular assays for tuberculosis [54, 55]. In one of these reported cases [54], a patient presented with inguinal lymphadenopathy as well as erythema nodosum-like lesions on his legs and forearms. A biopsy of an enlarged inguinal lymph node demonstrated caseating granulomata and numerous acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen staining; a portion of this node was sent for mycobacterial culture and molecular analysis. In addition, a skin biopsy of a forearm nodule was done; this revealed acid-fast bacilli that were morphologically typical of Mycobacterium leprae. A diagnosis of leprosy was made based on the clinical presentation and the skin biopsy results. However, the lymph node sent for mycobacterial culture and molecular analysis was positive by the Gen-Probe Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct (MTD) test. Although leprosy was still considered to be a correct diagnosis due to the clinical presentation and the skin biopsy findings, the possibility of this patient also having tuberculosis could not be ruled out until the culture results were known. Therefore, the patient was treated for both leprosy and tuberculosis until cultures at 7 weeks as well as additional PCR testing of lymph node material for M. tuberculosis were reported to be negative. A root cause analysis was done in order to investigate this misidentification. M. leprae culture material was obtained from the National Hansen\u2019s Disease Programs at Louisiana State University; these mycobacterial organisms were tested with the Gen-Probe MTD test and were positive at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 105 organisms per ml but were indeterminate at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 104 organisms per ml. The investigators concluded that a high concentration of M. leprae in a clinical specimen could lead to a false-positive result with the Gen-Probe MTD test [54]. M. leprae has also been misidentified as M. intracellulare by the COBAS AMPLICOR M. intracellulare test [55].",

Such neonatal airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli is associated with a cytokine response as well as with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia [112, 113]. The etiologic role of neonatal colonization in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is unclear at this time [114, 115], but molecular methods are providing further insight into the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in these infants [116]. Similarly, the etiologic role of bacterial colonization in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is currently being elucidated with the assistance of molecular methods [107\u2013110, 117, 118].",

Molecular methods that employ DNA sequencing are often considered completely accurate with 100% sensitivity and specificity. This, unfortunately, is not the case. There are a variety of technical factors such as the influence of contaminating DNA from other sources on the sequencing template, the selection of the primers used for the amplification, the quality of the base-calling software, and the method used for compiling the \u201cconsensus sequence\u201d from multiple forward and reverse reactions [102, 127, 128]. Inappropriately chosen gene targets and regions will result in false positives and negatives. The insertion sequence element IS481, found in several hundred copies in the B. pertussis genome, is frequently used as a target for B. pertussis detection and has a much greater analytical sensitivity than assays with single-copy target sequences, such as that of the pertussis toxin promoter [129, 130]. However, false-positive results have been reported due to the smaller copy numbers of IS481 existing in non-pertussis Bordetella species [131, 132]. The accuracy of assay development is often not appreciated by the non-molecular microbiologist or the clinician.",

The question of stool colonization by a potential pathogen versus a pathogen that is truly causing gastroenteritis can be difficult [151].

Because this specimen is generally a diarrheal stool sample, the extraction step becomes a critical step in this molecular diagnostic process. This is because stool is a complex mixture with multiple and diverse nucleic acids and amplification inhibitors. Investigators have noted that detection of a given target will reduced several logs when the target is placed in a stool mixture [142, 155]. This may result in enteric pathogens present in low numbers being missed. This is the reason that some investigators have used mass spectrometry as an identification method following isolation of potential enteric bacterial pathogens from stool [155, 156]. In addition, extraction of DNA from ova and parasites may be more difficult that extracting DNA from bacteria [157]. Concentration of ova and parasites that may be present in low numbers may be required [158], as it is and has been for microscopic evaluation for parasites [159].",

Even a multiplex approach will likely require the use of a diagnostic algorithm or the use of several multiplex assays. The use of multiplex assays will create several technical problems that include difficulty with discrimination of multiple targets in a single reaction and reduced sensitivity. Multiplex assays also will cause some problems with interpretation due to detection of multiple pathogens. For example, one study that reexamined stool samples using PCR found that the detection rate increased for both viral and bacterial pathogens, but the detection rate for multiple pathogens also increased [142\u2013144].

For example, HSV and Chlamydia pneumoniae detection in CSF specimens by real-time PCR is not as objective and sensitive in comparison to end detection PCR procedures [186, 187]. A negative FilmArray ME panel result does not exclude infection due to organisms that are not included in the panel, and false-negative results for targeted pathogens that are present in low quantities are still possible.

The comprehensive list of targets included in the ME panel ensures that an actionable diagnosis is not likely to be missed, but the false-positive results are problematic. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent false-positive detection made by the ME panel [178]; clinically irrelevant positive detections of H. influenzae also have been revealed in our institution (Tang, unpublished data). False-positive CSF test results can potentially result in significant harm if they lead to unnecessary, potentially toxic antimicrobial therapy or unwarranted invasive procedures. Several of the false-positive ME panel results in this published study theoretically could have had untoward sequelae if therapy or invasive procedures have been implemented [178]. These observations highlight the importance of laboratory operating procedures designed to minimize carryover contamination, even when using a \u201cclosed\u201d system such as the FilmArray. Operators should wear a mask when loading the FilmArray pouches and/or ideally use a biological safety cabinet or dead air box. Each laboratory must establish expected positivity rates for the individual targets contained in the ME panel in order to monitor for contamination [177]. Finally, interpreting the clinical significance of reactivated or latent Herpesviridae can be difficult. Providers must consider these results carefully in the clinical context.",

The rapid results obtained are useful for guiding antimicrobial therapy and improving infection prevention practices. However, when the system detects multiple microorganisms, it may be difficult to determine which microorganism caused the clinical infection. This can be particularly important if the real pathogen is missed (most likely due to the low test sensitivity) while a different microorganism is detected.

FDA approval does not necessarily mean that the ME panel is going to be the right approach for all patients with CNS infections. Several factors should be considered before implementing the ME panel [177]. First, which patients should be tested? The pathogens targeted by the ME panel are most appropriate for immunocompromised patients with CNS infections, a setting where members of the Herpesviridae as well as Cryptococcus species are commonly seen and cause significant disease. In pediatric and adult patients with acute meningitis and a high clinical suspicion for a bacterial infection, the ME panel could reduce the time to diagnosis and may be particularly useful in situations where patients have received empiric antimicrobial therapy prior to a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Short of these selected situations, targeted molecular testing with prioritization by most likely pathogens should be the first consideration. Laboratory screening criteria that are based in part on CSF nucleated cell counts might be a way to minimize unnecessary testing for immunocompetent adults [177, 189\u2013191]. It can be argued that performing targeted molecular testing based on clinical suspicion is likely to be more cost-effective for immunocompetent patients, especially when such testing can be done in-house. In summary, the ME panel appears to be an additional test that will not necessarily replace current approaches [177].",

In contrast, FFPE tissue is usually available as often is the only tissue available when molecular testing is considered as an afterthought [206]. Accordingly, one of the most important limitations in the use of molecular assays for diagnosing tissue infections is considering these assays at the time of biopsy so that fresh tissue can be used or frozen for use later. The difference in sensitivity for PCR testing can be seen by a study in which fresh nonembedded tissues were found to have sensitivities for PCR detection of fungi of 97% versus only 68% for FFPE tissue [217]. The reason for this decreased sensitivity is that nucleic acids obtained from FFPE tissue are frequently damaged (i.e., cross-linked) and may contain PCR inhibitors [219, 220]. If FFPE tissue must be used, a housekeeping human gene must be amplified as a control [206, 213, 220].",

Successful extraction of RNA from FFPE specimens depends on the prompt original tissue processing and a well-developed extraction protocol [215, 220, 227].",

When FFPE tissue is used, a punch biopsy can be used to take a sample from an area noted to have inflammation and/or microorganisms by a stained slide from the same tissue block. The stained slide can be marked and then used to direct the location for the punch biopsy sample from the tissue block. The use of fresh or frozen tissue is more problematic as the selection of tissue will be random and may not contain microorganisms.",

            "text": "Outcomes from infectious diseases often depend on early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy [228]. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is directly related to the length of time required for identification of the microbial pathogen [105, 106, 229]. Until recently, clinical microbiology laboratories have been handicapped by conventional, slow multistep culture-based techniques that require prolonged incubation times for many pathogens and are not able to isolate others. Clinicians unable by clinical judgment or diagnostic results to quickly and accurately identify a pathogen causing infection must adopt a conservative approach involving empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents [230]. Fortunately, this cumbersome approach has rapidly changed over the last two decades because of the increasing utilization of molecular diagnostic techniques [105, 106, 231]. Indeed, molecular assays such as NAATs have initiated a revolution in the field of diagnostic microbiology due to their high sensitivity, specificity, rapid test turnaround time, as well as potential high throughput and automation. In particular, emerging commercial molecular tests for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections promise to further improve patient outcomes in septic patients [19]. The adaption of molecular syndromic methods for microbiology diagnostics to the point-of-care laboratory also promises to improve patient outcomes [232]. Molecular assays have been heralded as the \u201cdiagnostic tool for the millennium\u201d [1, 3, 4]. However, molecular assays also bring some uncertainty such as that caused by false-positive results due to contamination from endogenous or exogenous sources of DNA [4, 8, 18, 20, 233]. For example, one study using a universal 16S rRNA PCR assays detected eubacterial DNA in blood samples from healthy subjects [234]. NAATs also may give false-negative results due to two principle reasons: (1) the relatively small sample required for PCR reactions and (2) technical problems associated with PCR processing [235]. Moreover, the results of molecular assays may be difficult to interpret and apply in the clinical setting. As NAATs are increasingly used in routine clinical microbiology laboratories, interpretation is expected to be more difficult as new tests are developed and more complicated multiplex assays emerge. For example, clinical relevance of positive NAATs in paraffin block specimens and multiple microbial organisms found in any specimen will need careful interpretation. As the usefulness of these molecular assays is determined by usage over time, communication between the clinician and the microbiology laboratory is always suggested and will be increasingly important whenever an interpretation is needed. Finally, both the clinical microbiologist and the clinician must acquire a working knowledge of the principles, diagnostic value, and limitations of these molecular assays [1, 236, 237].",
