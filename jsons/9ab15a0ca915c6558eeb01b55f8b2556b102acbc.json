Models of this type are used in mathematical epidemiology to capture the time evolution of highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Our approach relies on reformulating the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation as a stochastic minimum principle. This results in a system of forward backward stochastic differential equations, which is amenable to numerical solution via Monte Carlo simulations. We present a number of numerical solutions of the system under a variety of scenarios.",

This may lead to a panic reaction of the population and a chaotic and economically devastating public health response to the epidemic. In the absence of an effective vaccine (which would allow to immunize a portion of the population) the optimal policy is to isolate at least a significant fraction of the infected individuals so that the basic reproduction ratio R 0 can be brought significantly below one. Since we lack the knowledge who is infected and who is not, the public health response is to try to isolate everyone, whether susceptible, infected or immune.",

We use a variant of this method that involves the Hermite polynomials, and that was used for a similar purpose in [19] . This choice is natural, as conditional expectations of Hermite polynomials of a Gaussian random variable lead to simple closed form expressions. Let He k (x), k = 0, 1, . . ., denote the k-th normalized Hermite polynomial corresponding to the standard Gaussian measure d\u00b5(x) = (2\u03c0) \u22121/2 e \u2212x 2 /2 dx. These functions form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space L 2 R, d\u00b5 .",
