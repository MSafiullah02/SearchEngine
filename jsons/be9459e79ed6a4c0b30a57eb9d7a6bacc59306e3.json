            "text": "The term \"pulmonary vasculitis\" has been used in different ways. Primarily, it refers simply to infl ammation of the walls of vessels of any size in the lower respiratory tract. The term is, however, also used for the systemic vasculitis syndromes that commonly or predominantly present with involvement of the respiratory tract, such as the vasculitis syndromes associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Pulmonary vasculitis is usually associated with a systemic disorder caused by a variety of immunologic mechanisms. In the context of a vasculitis syndrome, the lungs and lower airways can be affected by three major pathologic processes: (1) infl ammatory cell infi ltration and necrosis of the pulmonary parenchyma; (2) infl ammation of the tracheobronchial tree often leading to stenoses; and (3) pulmonary capillaritis causing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Beyond capillaritis, infl ammation of vessels of different sizes in the lung, including pulmonary arteries, veins, and bronchial arteries, are comparably rare manifestations of some unique vasculitis syndromes. Clinicians should also remember that not all respiratory symptoms occurring in patients with vasculitis are caused by infl ammation of pulmonary vessels or the underlying vasculitis syndrome, infection being the most important alternative diagnosis. This chapter reviews the pulmonary manifestations of the various vasculitis syndromes using the recently revised Chapel Hill Consensus defi nitions and nomenclature [ 1 ] .",

Necrotizing arteritis involving smalland medium-sized arteries may be present. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common; pulmonary capillaritis resulting in alveolar hemorrhage occurs frequently [ 1 ] . GPA is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous infl ammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting small-to medium-sized vessels. The most commonly affected vessels are capillaries, venules, arterioles, and arteries, but the wall of the aorta can also be affected by necrotizing granulomatous infl ammation [ 1 ] . For these reasons the term \"polyangiitis\" is used for these syndromes [ 1 ] . It is the necrotizing granulomatous infl ammation that sets GPA apart from MPA. The diagnosis of GPA depends on the presence of clinical, pathologic, or radiographic evidence or surrogates of granulomatous infl ammation. The vasculitis of MPA is indistinguishable from that of GPA, and there may be substantial overlap between the syndromes. For these reasons, the therapeutic approach to patients with GPA and MPA is governed by the same principles, and most clinical studies and therapeutic trials have combined both diseases.",

MTX and AZA are equivalent for remission maintenance, whereas another randomized controlled trial showed that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is not as effective as AZA for remission maintenance [ 19 ] . Thus, the use of MMF for remission maintenance can only be supported for patients who have failed MTX and AZA, or who have contraindications for both agents. The Wegener's Granulomatosis Etanercept trial (WGET), in which MTX was used for remission maintenance, confi rmed that long-term remission remains an elusive goal for many patients, as remission was maintained in less than half of the patients [ 20 ] . The RTX in ANCA-associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial showed that a single 4-week infusion series of RTX was as effective as 18 months of conventional cytotoxic therapy with CYC followed by AZA, even though patients in the RTX treatment arm of that trial received no further therapy following the original infusion therapy [ 17 ] . Several recent studies including the RAVE trial have shown that PR3-ANCA (versus MPO-ANCA), the diagnosis of GPA (versus MPA), and relapsing disease (versus new diagnosis) represent risk factors for subsequent relapses even when patients are maintained on AZA for maintenance therapy [ 17 , 21 , 22 ] .",

Subglottic stenosis is often addressed with dilation procedures paired with local injection of long-acting glucocorticoids with or without mitomycin C [ 23 ] . Stenosis of the large airways may require bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation by rigid bronchoscope, YAG-laser treatment, and the placement of silicone airway stents, or balloon dilations which can be performed with the fl exible bronchoscope [ 5 ] . Tracheobronchial infections, like nose or sinus infections, are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease by promoting relapses. For this reason, it is advisable to provide antimicrobial therapy based on culture and susceptibility results from bronchial washings. The application of topical glucocorticoids may spare patients with tracheobronchial involvement from ongoing oral glucocorticoid therapy. Lastly, pneumocystis jerovecii pneumonia is a well recognized and potentially fatal complication of immunosuppressive therapy for GPA that can easily be prevented [ 24 ] . Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis is recommended for all patients with GPA receiving any kind of immunosuppression including being B-cell depleted after RTX therapy [ 25 ] .",

EGPA is included among the ANCA-associated vasculitides, but only 40-70 % of patients with active EGPA have detectable ANCA prior to treatment. If ANCA is detectable it is usually of the P-ANCA/MPO-ANCA type [ 26 , 27 ] . EGPA is primarily distinguished from GPA and MPA by a high prevalence of asthma and peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia. Three distinct disease phases which may not always follow in sequence have been described for the disease [ 28 ] . A prodromal allergic phase with asthma may last for a number of years. The eosinophilic phase with prominent peripheral and tissue eosinophilia may also last a number of years, and the manifestations may remit and recur over this time period. The differential diagnosis for patients in this phase of the disease includes parasitic infection and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The vasculitic phase consisting of systemic vasculitis may be life-threatening. This is usually the last phase and may be masked or prevented by glucocorticoid therapy used for the management of earlier phases. Asthma usually predates the vasculitic phase by a mean of 7 years (range 0-61). \"Formes frustes\" of EGPA have also been described with eosinophilic vasculitis and/or eosinophilic granulomas in isolated organs without evidence of systemic disease [ 29 ] .",

The disease presentation is usually rapidly progressive with pulmonary infi ltrates and fever, mimicking infection, and hemoptysis may be absent. Consequently, the differentiation of DAH from infection in SLE usually requires a diagnostic BAL. Mechanical ventilation, infection, and CYC therapy were reported as negative prognostic factors in one report. The reported mortality of DAH in SLE varies between 0 and 90 % [ 54 -56 ] . Treatment consists of glucocorticoids and CYC. The use of PLEX has been suggested, but its benefi t remains unproven.",

As DAH can also occur in the context of adult respiratory distress syndrome, and hemoptysis is absent in over half of the reported patients with APS and DAH, BAL should be performed early to establish the diagnosis. Tissue necrosis from microthrombosis as well as pulmonary capillaritis has been implicated as causes of DAH in APS. The capillaritis of APS is immune-complex mediated. The coexistence of thrombosis and capillaritis with DAH represents a therapeutic dilemma, as anticoagulation may need to be interrupted to control the hemorrhage, and patients often require placement of an inferior vena cava fi lter. The largest single-center report comprising 17 patients and review of 24 cases published in the literature indicates a high mortality of about 40 % despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [ 57 ] . Glucocorticoid therapy alone is usually ineffective, as is monotherapy with agents like AZA or MMF. PLEX in addition to immunosuppressive therapy is often considered, but its effi cacy remains questionable in patients with APS and DAH. Best results were obtained with cyclophosphamide or RTX, sometimes in combination.",

This lingered until he experienced signifi cant worsening of sinusitis symptoms 3 months later. At that time he also developed epistaxis prompting an evaluation by an allergist. A couple of weeks later he developed acute left-sided hearing loss, night sweats, and migratory large joint arthralgias. By this time he had already lost 10 lb of weight due to malaise and lack of appetite. Four months after the onset of fi rst symptoms he was hospitalized at a local rural hospital, where he was found to have dry cough, bilateral episcleritis, lower extremity palpable purpura, and nodular lesions on chest roentgenogram. A rheumatology evaluation at the local hospital led to testing for ANCA, and a nasal biopsy was obtained. Renal function and urinary sediment were normal. The ANCA test was positive for C-ANCA and PR3-ANCA, and the nasal biopsy reportedly showed \"granulomas.\" The patient was treated for 3 days with intravenous methylprednisolone and dismissed on oral prednisone 40 mg twice daily to be tapered to 30 mg daily over the course of the next 3 weeks. He was scheduled for initiation of RTX infusions 375 mg/m 2 as an outpatient. Scheduling diffi culties led to a delay in initiation of the infusions. Three weeks later, while on prednisone 30 mg daily he had noted signifi cant worsening of symptoms consisting of cough and malaise.",

Physical examination of eyes, ears, nose, heart, and lungs was unremarkable. Hemoglobin was 11.0 g/dL, white blood count 23.3 \u00d7 10 9 /L, platelet count 405 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and lymphocyte and CD4 count are normal. An electrolyte panel and urinalysis and microscopy were normal. The patient's only medications consisted of prednisone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. The patient was dismissed from the emergency room for further outpatient evaluation by rheumatology the next day. A CT scan of the chest is obtained (Fig. 10 .1b ) and after consultation with a pulmonologist a bronchoscopy with BAL is performed. This shows progressively bloody return indicative of alveolar hemorrhage. Over the next several hours the patient's respiratory status worsens, hemoglobin drops to 8.8 g/dL, and patient is admitted to the medical intensive care unit and requires mechanical ventilation. His course is complicated by the development of bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube placement. Methyl-prednisolone is given at a dose of 1 g/ day for 3 days, and one dose of RTX, 375 mg/ m 2 , is given, followed 48 h later by eight daily sessions of PLEX. Ten days after admission to the intensive care unit he is transferred to the general ward where the second chest tube is removed (Fig. 10.1c ) . Following completion of PLEX, he receives completion of the RTX course (the remaining three once weekly doses). Following recovery he completes the taper of the prednisone dose to complete discontinuation before month 6. He has not relapsed over the course of the last 3 years. However, he has been retreated once with RTX without glucocorticoids following reconstitution of B-cells and recurrence of PR3-ANCA positivity.",

The provided information does not allow the distinction between conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, and we don't know whether the eye infl ammation was merely episcleritis or early scleritis. Sensorineural hearing loss and scleritis are clearly severe disease manifestations. The classifi cation as severe disease for treatment purposes made at the outside hospital is certainly appropriate. For a newly diagnosed patient with severe GPA, cyclophosphamide or RTX is equally effective.
