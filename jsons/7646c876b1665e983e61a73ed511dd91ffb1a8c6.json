For hospital demand projections, patient-level clinical outcome data will enable more accurate conclusions than poorly reported worldwide aggregate mortality data with point estimates of how deaths translate into hospital use. Local data are less likely to be subject to undercounting or reporting errors, helping hospitals better prepare for the immediate future. It is also unlikely that a \"one-size\" model will fit all regions at all times. Policymakers will be best served when they consider projections from multiple models, thus increasing the understanding of factors that influence disparate projections and enhancing comprehension of unaccounted uncertainty in any one model. Major policy decisions need model input, but models are valuable only to the extent that outputs are transparent, are valid, are based on accurate documented sources, are rigorously evaluated, and yield robust and reliable projections.",
