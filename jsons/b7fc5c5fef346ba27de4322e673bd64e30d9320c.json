In this way, haptic simulators are being applied in the field of endodontics, restorative dentistry and dental prostheses, among others.",

CBT has been proven effective for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and has begun to be applied for psychosomatic problems in the dental patients. The prevalence of TMD in a community sample was almost 17.5% and the incidence even higher during the worldwide epidemic. Studies reported that CBT was more effective than no treatment. 1 Although CBTs were mainly conducted by psychologists, those conducted by trained dental hygienists were also found to be effective in reducing TMD pain and painrelated interference.",

Approximately 10-12% of the adult population suffer from dental anxiety. 3 A significant reduction in subjective anxiety was achieved by patients with CBT when compared to those who received no treatment or anaesthesia/sedation.

Both organisations provide patients with expert and evidence-based information that relates to their oral, orthodontic and overall health. The campaign was launched after the recent statement released by the General Dental Council recommending that for all dental interventions patients should have a face-to-face consultation with a trained clinician at the beginning of treatment. This is of paramount importance as patients need to make informed decisions about their treatment, and the only way to do so, is for the patients to see a trained clinician in person to discuss the treatment (and indeed alternatives) in detail (including risks and complications) so that they are fully informed of what to expect from the outset.",

He continued: 'For me, one of the issues with \"DIY Braces\" is that it offers just one narrow solution when there may be a more appropriate one for the patient. The value of informed choice cannot be over-estimated. ' This is a huge step that should, hopefully, raise awareness of the dangers of direct to consumer orthodontics to the general public.",
