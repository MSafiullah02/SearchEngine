The ancient Egyptians sterilized drinking water and wounds using metals such as silver and copper. The Romans catalogued numerous medicinal uses of copper for various diseases. The Aztecs treated sore throats with copper, while in Persia and India, copper was applied to treat boils, eye infections, and venereal ulcers [9] . Soluble copper compounds have been shown to provide excellent antimicrobial activity against a number of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, algae, and viruses, while these species are relatively safe for humans [10] . Copper appears to exert its killing effect by generating reactive hydroxyl radicals that can cause irreparable damage such as the oxidation of proteins, cleavage of DNA and RNA molecules, and membrane damage due to lipid peroxidation [11, 12] .",

Cu nanorods were obtained by the same route as CuNPs, except that 0.1 equivalent of dodecylammonium bromide was added as structure-directing surfactant. The Cu nanostructures prepared by this route could be further functionalized by exchanging weakly bound surfactants to tighter binding alkane-thiols. This functionalization allowed for the control of surface chemistry and solubility of CuNPs and CuNRs in different solvents, and yielded nanostructures that were stable in solution for prolonged periods of time. Noticeably, copper nanoparticles functionalized with positively charged thiols were stable in water for several months. Cu-containing particles could be precipitated from phenyl ether with ethanol and re-dispersed in toluene or hexane for further use [21] . ",

Since it is known that CuNPs may aggregate quickly in colloidal media, the extent of agglomeration can be effectively reduced by lowering the surface energy by adsorption of stabilizers such as polymers or surfactants present in the medium. The incorporation of smaller inorganic particles into larger polymers is also desirable in order to combine the key properties of both the materials. A few years ago, the group of C. Neckers reported on the synthesis of functionalized CuNPs/polymer composites. The preparation protocol was based on two steps: at first, functionalized CuNPs were obtained by a modification of the Brust's procedure, introducing a polymerizable acrylic functionality into the NPs shell. Then, CuNPs were integrated into the polymer backbone by means of a specific cross-linking process, providing a way to control on the ionic release from the particles [22] . Colloidal CuNPs have been recently synthesized in a solution of hyperbranched polyamine (HBPA) by a reduction in the presence of NaBH 4 . Hence, hyperbranched polymer was simultaneously supporting the stabilization of metal colloidal solution, and preventing agglomeration and precipitation of the particles [23] .",

As a result, 14-nm copper nanospheres were selectively immobilized at the bentonite nano-platelet surface. Key feature of this technology is the in situ formation of bentonite-supported metal nanoparticles which are assembled at the surface of the cationic polymer latex. As a consequence, a fragile inorganic shell is obtained, which is ruptured during melt processing, producing very uniform fine dispersions of bentonite/metal hybrid nanoparticles. This approach was demonstrated for PMMA but offers several new preparation routes for other acrylic and styrene monomers [24] .",

For example, agarose has been utilized to prepare bioactive composite films containing metal/semiconductor nanoparticles by introducing a metal/semiconductor precursor solution followed by a reducing agent, such as hydrazine hydrate, during the agarose gelation process. In a typical synthesis, agarose powder was dissolved in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth kept at 80 C with constant stirring. CuSO 4 was added to this system at two different concentrations (about 3 and 6 mg of Cu per millilitre of LB broth), followed by the addition of N 2 H 4 hydrate solution. The immediate appearance of wine red color was observed, indicating the formation of CuNPs which became faint upon solidification, and then was masked by the components of LB broth. The nanoparticles were trapped in the LB agarose matrix, which was then employed to check the NPs antibacterial activity, without further modification [26] .",

CuNPs were prepared using a small-scale electrolytic process, performed by using a three-electrode cell, equipped with a copper sheet as sacrificial electrode, a platinum sheet as cathode electrode, and Ag/AgNO 3 0.1 M in acetonitrile as reference electrode. During such a process, when the applied potential is sufficiently high, the anode dissolves under the form of metal ions that are subsequently reduced at the cathode surface in the presence of proper surfactants, such as tetra-nalkyl-ammonium salts, which stabilize the nanoparticle under the form of a core-shell structure in which the copper core is surrounded by quaternary ammonium ions ( Fig. 3 .7) [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Core-shell CuNPs were directly obtained as nanocolloidal dispersion in a solution of disinfecting quaternary ammonium species, and then they could be easily mixed to water-insoluble polymers which were ultrasonically dissolved in the electrolysis solution. Several dispersing polymers were tested, including polyvinylmethyl-ketone (PVMK), polyvinyl-chloride (PVC), polyvinyldene-fluoride (PVDF), estel 1100, etc., as a function of the final application envisaged. The resulting CuNPs/ polymer hybrid solutions -with different CuNPs loadings -were directly spin-coated onto proper substrates for further characterization or applications. Moreover, despite unsupported copper colloids being extremely active against a wide range of bacterial pathogens [26] , bioactivity experiments carried out on nanoparticles embedded in a polymer matrix showed that supported CuNPs may provide very high ion-release and eventually a significant efficiency in preventing microbial growth. Using supported materials in place of unsupported ones, affords a higher environmental compatibility for a wider range of applications, either as freestanding nanocomposites or as deposited thin nanostructured films. Lipophilic nanoparticles embedded into water-insoluble polymers cannot be released into the environmental media or when allowed in contact with aqueous solutions. Using different amounts of core-shell particles or properly choosing the stabilizing shell was shown to provide a way to finely select the concentration levels of released Cu ions. In fact, the stabilized structure of the CuNPs allowed a gradual and controlled copper ions release, when the nanocoatings were exposed to aqueous solutions ( Fig. 3 .8). The release extent of bioactive ions was demonstrated to be easily tuneable by a proper selection of preparation parameters, such as, for instance, the metal loading in the film. Noteworthy, the latter is a key aspect in order to kill or inhibit the growth of harmful species, without affecting the health of human beings [42, 47] .",

Several multilayered thin films were deposited by alternately rotating the substrates from the plasma of Cr target to the plasma of Cu target. The target power values of Cr and Cu were adjusted to achieve a Cr 2 N/Cu thickness ratio of around 9:1. Different bi-layer periods (L) were achieved by controlling the substrate holding time in the plasma of Cr or Cu.

One of the advantages of this approach is that low-energy Cu PIII can introduce a large amount of Cu into the polymer without causing too much damage to the polymer surface [53] [54] [55] . In a later study by the same authors, medical-grade PE specimens were implanted with Cu in a plasma immersion ion implanter equipped with a copper cathodic arc plasma source and nitrogen PIII was performed to change the structure of the implanted region of the substrate [56] . Compared to single plasma implantation processes, this dual PIII process (Cu/N 2 PIII) provided a better control over the copper release rate and improved the long-term antibacterial properties of the Cu-PE nanomaterials, producing new polar unsaturated functional groups such as C \u00bc N and C N in the near surface of the polymer [56] .",

In another paper, the same authors showed that nanocopper alginate-cotton cellulose fibees efficiently inhibit bacterial growth (Fig. 3.9 ) [9] . The disk diffusion assay of Cu-SiO 2 nanocomposites was determined by placing an 8-mm disk saturated with 50 mL of Cu-SiO 2 -1, Cu-SiO 2 -3, and Cu-SiO 2 -4 nanocomposite aqueous slurry onto an agar plate seeded with E.coli (ATCC 25922). After 24 h of incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones were measured.

For the ZoI assays, the zones of inhibition from the surface were measured using an electronic micrometer. For the NBT assays, significant reduction in the number of viable cells was observed with increasing Cu content, compared to the 'pure' nitride surfaces, while no zones of inhibition were observed. This could be explained by considering that the latter assay is sensitive to ion leaching from the surface into the agar [49] . In a recent work, Cu nanoparticles/chitosan composite films were tested against S. aureus (ATCC 25923). A standard plate count method on Mueller-Hinton Agar was used to determine the concentration of bacteria capable of reproducing. The composite film was effective in reducing microbial concentration in the bulk fluid for the microorganism tested.

Usually, this microorganism infects the pulmonary and urinary tracts, as well as burns, wounds, and also causes other blood infections. As a consequence, P. aeruginosa is a target species of considerable applicative interest. In the case of TiN/Cu films, similar considerations to S. aureus could be done about the biological results as reported in Sect. 3.1.2 [49] . In the case of Cr 2 N/Cu multilayered thin films, the antibacterial rate reached 100% at a Cr 2 N/Cu layer thickness ratio of 3:7 [52] . Finally, copper oxide nanoparticles in suspension were used to determine the lowest bactericidal concentration required to prevent the growth of P. aeruginosa; the resulting MBC value was 5,000 mg/mL [57] .",

Among the referenced studies on Cu-nano-antimicrobials, only the group of Neckers has chosen strains of green algae and diatoms to detect the biological activity of different functionalized copper NPs/polymer composites. A freshwater green alga, Chlamydomonas sp. strain CD1 Red, and the marine diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCMP 1327, were used as test organisms. Cu NP/polymer composite pellets were immersed into the flasks containing the growing cells at the start of the culture period. Two controls were established: the culture without any polymers or biocides, and the polymer lacking any copper particles. The latter was important to probe the effects of the polymer matrix or the irradiated photo-initiator on cell growth. Cell growth of the green algae was correlated with absorbance measured at 24-h intervals at 680 nm. The cell growth of the diatoms was monitored daily by measuring in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence (l ex \u00bc 436 nm; l em \u00bc 680 nm). The antimicrobial activity of the acrylated copper nanoparticles developed by Neckers' group matched well with conventionally used biocides [22] .",
