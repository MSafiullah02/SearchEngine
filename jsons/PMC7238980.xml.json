Never before have I seen so many webinars, so many pundits, and so many listeners on this topic. But then, we live in times where so much of what we took for granted has been thrown under the bus. Who could have imagined even just a few months ago that much of the world would be looking down the barrel of an economic recession unlike any witnessed in our lifetime?",

Just the word \u2018pandemic\u2019 and the dramatic way it was announced by the WHO after weeks of the epidemic unfolding around the world was a hair-raising moment. Then, there was the apocalyptic messaging by modellers about the millions of dead bodies that would be littering our cities and by the media on the risk the disease posed- for example failing to communicate that the median age of death was in the mid-70 s; emerging data demonstrating the vast number of asymptomatic individuals suggests the overall mortality rate is well below 1%, falling to nearly zero in young people. The ghoulish reporting of cases, without any nuancing about what those numbers actually mean, served to confirm in people\u2019s minds that the virus was inexorably sweeping the world. The final nail in the coffin were the unprecedented national lockdowns, nowhere as brutal, unplanned and sweeping as the one in India, announced with just four hours\u2019 notice late in the evening, with a scope and stringency that has never been seen in history.",

            "text": "In this context, unless you are an epidemiologist who is well-informed to correctly interpret the numbers and read between the lines, the wide-spread reactions of panic and fear are totally understandable. Indeed, if one considers the constant uncertainty about when, if ever, life will return to a semblance of what we used to experience, the torrent of mixed messages about the science (real or fake) around the virus, and the complete lack of consensus on what the post-lockdown scenario for the containment of the virus might look like, I think it might even be somewhat unexpected for an individual to report being in great mental health in these times! It is not at all surprising that experiences of anxiety, fearfulness, sleep problems, irritability and feelings of hopelessness have become widespread. They are mostly rational responses of our minds to the extraordinary realities that we are facing. That said, if the curve of the severity of mental health symptoms (apologies to those who are fed up of seeing the word \u2018curve\u2019) has shifted to the right, i.e. towards greater severity, one will also be seeing a rising incidence of clinically significant mental health problems and suicide, as was observed in a previous coronavirus epidemic in Hong Kong (Cheung et al., 2008). Furthermore, thanks to lockdowns and the pivoting of health care services to this one virus, there is emerging evidence that routine mental health care has been seriously disrupted affecting not just incident illness episodes but also the continuing care of pre-existing mental health problems.",

This would not be surprising, given the strong association between unemployment, acute poverty and indebtedness with poor mental health (Lund et al., 2018). \u201cDeaths of despair\u201d have been documented as the cause for the increased mortality and reduction in life expectancy in working-age Americans following the economic recession in 2008 (Case & Deaton, 2020). Tracing the source of these deaths ultimately to a deeply unfair economic system, the authors point out that these deaths were not so much due to material hardship but because of loss of hope due to the lack of employment and rising inequality. Suicide and substance use related mortality accounted for most of these deaths. Many low and middle income countries share the ills of US society, from its profound inequality to its weak social security net and fragmented health care systems; in addition, these countries are also home to the largest number of poor people in the world, already enfeebled by hunger and myriad diseases of poverty. This toxic combination of absolute poverty with rising levels of inequality is a recipe for a similar surge of depths of despair in the region. Mental health care systems in most countries will be ill-equipped to deal with this surge, not only because of the paucity of skilled providers, but also because of the narrow biomedical models which dominate mental health care.",

This is compounded by yet another barrier: digital literacy and adequate internet connectivity still remains a distant goal for large swathes of the world\u2019s people, particularly amongst the poor and rural populations. Still, one welcome aspect of this development is the recognition of the possibility of remote delivery and the value of psychological therapies, often ignored in mental health care and, at best, playing a poor cousin to medication options. At the same time, low-resource settings have been a laboratory for some of the most transformative innovations to improve access to evidence based psychological therapies in psychiatry with a flurry of randomized controlled trials for depression, psychoses and harmful drinking reframing the way we can enhance the coverage of these interventions. This critically important clinical and implementation science is now influencing global policies and, incredibly, also the way mental health care is organized in rich countries which enjoy so much more mental health resources.",

            "text": "The impressive body of evidence generated by global mental health researchers has generated a range of innovative strategies aimed at addressing the structural barriers to the scaling up of psychosocial therapies, notably the demonstration that pared down \u2018elements\u2019 of complex psychological treatments packages can be just as effective as standardized treatment protocols (for e.g. behavioural activation for depression, compared with cognitive behaviour treatments); that providers can be trained to learn a library of such \u2018elements\u2019 targeting specific types of mental health experiences (for example, mood problems, anxiety problems, trauma related problems) and to use simple decision making algorithms to \u2018match\u2019 patients\u2019 problems with specific treatments elements; that one does not require a formal diagnosis to trigger care, greatly simplifying the dissemination of effective treatments; that these pared down treatments elements and trans-diagnostic protocols can be effectively delivered by non-specialist \u201ctherapists\u201d, such as community health workers; that these delivery models are highly acceptable to consumers; show recovery rates comparable to specialist care models, and economic analyses show they are excellent value for money (Kohrt et al., 2018; Singla et al., 2017). More recent innovations seeking to scale up these approaches demonstrate the acceptability and effectiveness of digital training in the delivery of psychological treatments and of peer supervision for quality assurance (Muke et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2014). This range of innovations, when combined and scaled up, can transform access to one of the most effective interventions in medicine.",

Over the coming years, we intend to build on the ongoing work of the ESSENCE program, a NIMH funded research Hub, led by Sangath in partnership with the government of Madhya Pradesh, to digitize the curriculum of a brief behavioural activation treatment for depression (Patel et al., 2017), its competency assessments and the supervision and quality assurance protocols. Ultimately, this platform will offer a career path which enables front-line providers an opportunity to achieve the status of an expert, motivating them and ensuring sustainability of the most expensive mental health professional resource. Future enhancements include evaluating the effectiveness of the scaling up on population mental health and harnessing big data opportunities to develop prediction models to refine treatment element selection algorithms to optimize patient outcomes. The use of digital platforms for building the workforce is not only aligned with the use of tele-medicine but also with the urgent need for digital approaches for training and supervision in the light of physical distancing policies.",

I recall this happening way back in the late 1990s when it appeared that mental health would finally be recognized as a priority by the world\u2019s leading development agencies only for it to be left off the table by the Millenium Development Goals of 2000. Fifteen years later, mental health found its rightful place in the Sustainable Development Goals and I could begin to sense its inclusion in the priorities of funders who had previously given it a pass. And now we are in the first half of 2020 and all funding and health care action has entirely pivoted towards one disease- Covid19. Already some of the funding I had come close to securing for EMPOWER has been stalled. And some of it may never be realized. It is deeply worrying that despite the strong mental health concerns in the light of the pandemic, there seems to be no meaningful role played by mental health professionals in guiding public policies on the epidemic. Once again, mental health risks are being shoved back into the shadows. This is a timely moment for diverse stakeholders concerned with mental health, from psychiatric associations and global mental health practitioners to civil society advocates, to unite with one message, that the pandemic and its socio-economic consequences will have profound effects on population mental health and that some of the financial resources being pumped into the Covid19 response must be allocated to \u2018build back better\u2019 mental health care systems in all countries.",
