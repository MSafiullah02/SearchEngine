In line with this paradigm shift, the importance of TCM and gut microbiome in healthcare, as well as their interplay, has become clearer. Firstly, we briefly summarize the current status of three topics in this review: microbiome, TCM, and relationship of TCM and microbiome. Second, we focused on TCM's therapeutic effects and gut microbiome's mediation roles, including the relationships among diet, gut microbiome, and health care. Third, we have summarized some databases and tools to help understand the impact of TCM and gut microbiome on diagnosis and treatment at the molecular level. Finally, we introduce the effects of gut microbiome on TCM and host health, with two case studies, one on the metabolic effect of gut microbiome on TCM, and another on cancer treatment. In summary, we have reviewed the current status of the two components of healthcare: TCM and gut microbiome, as well as their concert effects. It is quite clear that as the holobiont, the maintenance of the health status of human would depend heavily on TCM, gut microbiome, and their combined effects.",

It has recently emerged as a crucial factor in human physiology and disease. Taking the microbiome into consideration, human beings could be considered \"super organisms,\" with around 10% human cells and 90% microbial cells, most of which can be found in the gut (Lederberg, 2000) . The human gut is a biological niche, home to a variety of microbes that affect nearly all aspects of human biology through their interactions with their hosts (Blaser, 2014) . The human intestinal flora is a complex micro-ecosystem, containing approximately 10 14 microbes from more than 1,000 microbial species, of which the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Gill et al., 2006) account for more than 90% of the species above. In addition, the genetic factors, dietary habits, and various environmental factors of the host lead to the diversity and the specificity of the human intestinal flora, while human intestinal flora in turn would play important roles in exerting host's physiological functions, such as metabolism, energy intake, and immune regulation.",

Environment, drugs, and the other factors that destroy the structure of intestinal flora will cause dysbiosis, which may influence human health. Recent studies have already accumulated ample evidences that the gut microbiome plays pivotal roles in many forms of chronic diseases. For example, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic bowel disease with clinical symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and unknown etiology, it includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) . The fecal microbiome of CD patients contains a significant reduction of Firmicutes diversity, and it's worth mentioning that the Clostridium leptum phylogenetic group has less abundance in CD patients than healthy (Manichanh et al., 2006) . Constipation is a common health problem with high mortality, as well as a predisposing factor for many conditions. Bifidobacterium adolescentis exhibited strain-specific effects in alleviation of constipation . Obesity is a global problem in that nearly 12% of the people worldwide are obese. Obese mice had 50% fewer Bacteroidetes and more correspondingly Firmicutes than their lean littermates (Ley et al., 2005) . Besides, they reached similar conclusions for obese people (Ley et al., 2007) . Dietary interventions might lead to the modulation of gut microbiome, which will contribute to weight loss, enhance the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and reduce the antigenic load in the circulation, ultimately improving the inflammatory and metabolic phenotypes (Xiao et al., 2014) . Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disorder affected by genetic and environmental components (Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2005; Ris\u00e9 rus et al., 2009) , and become a major public health problem on a global scale. A protocol has been developed for the metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and a two-phase approach has been taken based on high-throughput sequencing of the intestinal microbiome of 345 Chinese individuals. MGWAS analysis revealed that the intestinal microbiome of patients with T2D was mal-regulated, which was manifested by the decrease in the abundance of certain universal butyrate-producing bacteria and the increase of pathogenic bacteria in various conditions (Qin et al., 2012) . Metformin is a widely used drug in the treatment of T2D. A recent study discovered the mechanism of metformin by regulating the composition of gut microbiome (Wu et al., 2017) , indicating a close relation between the gut microbiome and T2D.",

It has been developed in clinics over thousands of years and has accumulated abundant clinical experience, forming a field with unique experiences and specific theories. The TCM system is complex, as it contains components of natural plants, animals, and mineral materials. TCM uses therapeutic herbs to treat the disease and restore the balance of physical function according to the patient's syndrome, based on the combination principle of \"King, Vassal, Assistant and Delivery Servant\" (Yi and Chang, 2004) . Each prescription combination of these herbs is called a TCM preparation or prescription, such as LiuWeiDiHuangWan (LWDHW) pills. Many Chinese herbal medicines are known for their therapeutic effects compared to chemical and biological agents (Chan, 1995; Corson and Crews, 2007; Qiu, 2007) , which contain not only bioactive components but also various nutrients such as proteins and polysaccharides. For example, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., also called \"Gan-Cao\" in China, as a health-preserving and therapeutic agent, it has been widely utilized for more than 2,000 years. It is one of the most broadly used ingredients in TCM preparations in China, exerting a wide range of pharmacological efficacies. Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. contains many bioactive ingredients, including glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrol, coumarin, and alkaloids. In addition, previous studies have shown that Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. has a variety of pharmacological effects, including antitumor (Shibata et al., 1991) , antiviral (Nakashima et al., 1987) , and anti-inflammatory effects (Kimura et al., 1988) .",

In contrast, since one of the characteristics of TCM is oral administration, the drug will interact with the intestinal flora inevitably. Previous studies have proven that TCM is conductive to maintain the homeostasis of the intestinal flora (Chang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016) , and the gut microbiome could also exert pharmacological effects of the TCM on host (Park et al., 2006) , which render TCM a potential new drug in the western markets.

A water extract of G. lucidum has antiobesogenic effects, as it could modulate the taxonomical composition of the gut microbiome (Chang et al., 2015) . The water extract of G. lucidum mycelium can reverse high-fat diet (HFD)-induced gut dysbiosis, indicated by the decreased Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratios and endotoxin-bearing Proteobacteria levels. It can also maintain intestinal barrier integrity and reduce metabolic endotoxemia. In addition, it can reduce the expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1b), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are improved by the extract as well. These effects are especially mediated by the gut microbiome, as it has already been observed from experiments on mice that the weight loss effect induced by G. lucidum is transmissible via transfer of feces from G. lucidum-treated mice to HFD-fed mice. The study has also demonstrated that the antiobesogenic effect of the G. lucidum water extract is mainly owing to its high molecular weight polysaccharide fraction (>300 kDa). G. lucidum polysaccharide can inhibit colon expansion of colorectal cancer (CRC) mice and reduce mortality by 30%, by alteration of reduced the relative abundance (RA) of cecal Oscillospirawhich was first observed in CRC mice, and down-regulation of four cancer-related genes (Acaa1b, Fabp4, Mgll, and Scd1) expression of colonic epithelial cells (Luo et al., 2018) .",

In their study, compared to the patients with a low dose GQD and the placebo, patients who received high dose and moderate dose GQD showed remarkable reductions in adjusted mean changes from baseline fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was a species enriched significantly by GQD; the species was negatively correlated with HbA1c and FBG, while 2-h postprandial blood-glucose levels were positively correlated with homeostasis model assessment of b-cell function, which suggests that the structure of gut microbiome was changed by GQD. Furthermore, the amounts of beneficial bacterium, such as Faecalibacterium spp., could be enriched by GQD treatment. It has been reported that another TCM, Polygonatum kingianum, is effective in the treatment of diabetes and related diseases (Deng et al., 2012) . A phytochemistry investigation demonstrated that the major types of active chemical constituents of P. kingianum were total saponins (TSPK) and total polysaccharides (PSPK). TSPK and PSPK could prevent the increase of fasting blood glucose after oral administration, and TSPK could increase the content of fasting insulin. Since TSPK and PSPK improved the intestinal microecology by increasing the abundance of Firmicutes and decreasing that of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, TSPK and PSPK could prevent T2D by changing the regulation of the gut microbiome (Yan et al., 2017) .",

In addition to TCM directly acting on gut microbiome to ameliorate diseases, some TCMs exert indirect effects on the intestinal flora . Ginsenosides and polysaccharides in Du-Shen-Tang made from Panax Ginseng are used to investigate their pharmacological effects on acute cold stress and overfatigue. It was demonstrated that the intestinal metabolism and absorption of certain ginsenosides were improved by polysaccharides.

After administering different doses of licorice aqueous extracts to mice, they found that the proportion of Bacteroides gates decreased significantly, and the proportion of phylum Firmicutes increased and became dominant. Bacteroides was reported to be associated with IgA in humans and may cause colitis, and more phylum Firmicutes than Bacteroides lead to more efficient absorption of food calories. Therefore, it is speculated that licorice aqueous extract can promote intestinal absorption, anti-inflammatory effect, and treatment of abdominal pain . Diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), the main component of licorice root extracts, is a compound of the natural bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoid glycoside, can protect against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice through the decreasing of Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio and endotoxin-producing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, and elevate the abundance of probiotics such as Proteobacteria and Lactobacillus.

Carbohydrates are important components of the daily diet and include monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Both fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and polyphenols can be transferred directly into the large intestine of mammals alone, reshaping the composition of gut microbiome, which is beneficial to human health. The combination of different phenolic compounds and FOS had a distinct impact upon the host, and gut microbiome improved by using prebiotics can delay the onset of senescencerelated health problems (Zheng et al., 2017; Tanabe et al., 2019) . Adding catechin to an FOS diet could inhibit Firmicutes and enhance Bacteroidetes. In addition, it turns out that antibiotic treatment influences the diversity and composition of the gut microbial community. Furthermore, the use of probiotics or prebiotics to modulate antibiotic-induced gut microbiome destruction has been considered a desired treatment or prophylaxis (Bron et al., 2011) . Cefixime can reduce the diversity of the microbial community and lead to a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes. The composition of gut microbiome of Lactobacillus and FOS probiotic mixture treatment group was much more diverse than that of the natural recovery group, indicating a better recovery effect of the probiotic cocktails on the gut microbiome (Shi et al., 2017) . Moreover, the composition of the gut microbiome significantly changed in the HFD + fructose (HFF)-fed and the HFD + sucrose (HFS)-fed rats compared with the control diet (C)-fed rats; body-fat mass, metabolic inflexibility, glucose intolerance, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), insulin, renal reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Nadphox, and Srebp-1 were significantly higher, and antioxidant enzymes and lean body masses were significantly lower in the HFS group with respect for the HFF group (Rosas-Villegas et al., 2017) , indicating the harmful effect on the HFS group and the HFF group on gut microbiome as well as the health of humans. Carrageenan, agarose, and alginate are algae-derived undigested polysaccharides that have been used as food additives for hundreds of years. Bacteroides uniforms L8 could degrade agarose completely, and the major enzyme secreted was b-agarase. The enzyme produced by isolate 38F6 (Bacteroides xylanisolvens and Escherichia coli), which degrades k-carrageenan oligosaccharides, is b-carrageenase, and alginate, guluronic acid oligosaccharides, and mannuronic acid oligosaccharides could be degraded by two enzymes from Bacteroides ovatus G19 .",

For example, QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010 ) is a software that provides an open-source bioinformatics pipeline for performing microbiome analysis from raw DNA sequencing data. It includes demultiplexing, quality filtering, operational taxonomic units (OTU) picking, taxonomic assignment, phylogenetic reconstruction, diversity of analyses and visualizations. PICRUSt (Langille et al., 2013) is designed to predict microbiome functional content from marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA) surveys and full genomes. MetaPhlAn (Segata et al., 2013 ) is a computational tool for microbial communities analysis based on metagenomic sequencing data, in which the data were compared with the markers of each species obtained from the known database to determine the species category. MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994) are two algorithms used for multiple sequence alignments; MUSCLE is a computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. MEGA (Kumar et al., 2016 ) is a computer program package for estimating evolutionary distances, reconstructing phylogenetic trees, and computing basic statistical quantities from molecular data. Additionally, iTOL (Letunic and Bork, 2016) is an online tool for visualization, annotation, and management of phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, with the development of deep learning, many methods have been used for studying the gut microbiome and diseases. For example, a model was constructed to predict responses to anti-integrin biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases through gut microbiome function (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2017) . Although many approaches are not currently used in TCM study on gut microbiome, related methods will become a future trend. Therefore, additional investigations are warranted. Furthermore, interactive visualization tools are of equal importance. Cytoscape is an open-source platform that could be used for complex network analysis and visualization (Shannon et al., 2003) , which is useful for analyzing the network in network pharmacology studies. Similar functions are also offered by the web services of many databases.",

The effects of these polyphenols in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, T2D, and cognitive dysfunction are supported by an increasing number of studies (Del et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2014) . To exert their effects, flavonoids are metabolized by the gut microbiome, and the resulting compounds may have bioactivity. Such bacterial conversion and potential health consequences for the human host (Chiou et al., 2014) are hardly unique: Baicalin, puerarin, and daidzin, which are widely found in TCM prescriptions, can also be metabolized by gut microbiome (Kim et al., 1998) . As baicalin is difficult to be absorbed in the gut, it has to be hydrolyzed by gut microbiome to baicalein to exert its effect. Metabolism of baicalin was hardly detected in germ-free rats compared to conventional rats, indicating that gut microbiome play a key role in the metabolism of baicalin (Akao et al., 2001) . (Mochizuki et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2013) . Ginsenoside compounds K (CK) is one of the metabolites of ginsengoside, which exerts various pharmacological effects, including antiallergic (Shin and Kim, 2005) , antidiabetic (Kim et al., 2014) , anticarcinogenic (Zhou et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013) , anti-inflammatory (Joh et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014) , and antiaging effects (Kim et al., 2004) . The occurrence of CK in rat plasma is required for intestinal bacterial hydrolysis after oral administration of ginsengosides (Akao et al., 1998) . When human intestinal flora was cultured anaerobically with ginsengosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc, these ginsengosides were metabolized into CK, where the transformation of Rc is conducted by the concert efforts of Bacteroides spp., Eubacterium spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. (Bae et al., 2000; Bae et al., 2002) . In addition, intestinal bacterial metabolism of ginsengosides was mainly dependent on the composition of intestinal flora, such as Bacteroides spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Bifidobactetium spp. (Kyung-Ah Kim et al., 2013) . Additionally, the metabolism of panax notoginseng saponins (PNSs) was influenced by gut microbiome, of which proteobacteria may have an effect on the deglycosylated metabolism of PNSs by regulating the activities of glycosidases (Xiao et al., 2016) . Up-regulation of Bacteroidetes may increase the activity of redox metabolic enzymes in intestinal flora and accelerate the redox metabolism of PNSs (Xiao et al., 2016) .",

With the launch of various international projects on the human microbiome, research on the gut microbiome has become a hot research area. Studies have proven that TCM could be used as a perfect agent to treat many kinds of diseases, many of which were mediated by gut microbiome. Therefore, combination of the research of TCM and gut microbiome is important to maintain the healthy status of the host-microbiome holobiont. In addition, with the advancement of biological big data research, databases can now provide a more holistic perspective for TCM research and intestinal flora research.

With the constant increase in research in related fields, various experimental data have been generated. These all require better ways to curate, analyze, and interpret the concerted effects of TCM and the microbiome on human health. First, a more comprehensive database on TCM and gut microbiome is needed, which should not only include the interaction between the TCM and the gut microbiome but should also represent the advantages of TCM databases and microbiome databases in accelerating the application of TCM on a global scale. Second, analytical methods must keep pace with the rapid development of modern systems biology. A more powerful data mining tool is required to investigate the complex and multi-scale \"TCM-hostmicrobiome\" network. Third, investigations on the mechanisms of mutual regulation between TCM and gut microbiome are limited. How do various TCMs regulate dysbiotic microbiome in concert? What kinds of enzymes produced by gut microbiome are responsible for metabolizing TCM and exerting the effect of TCM? These only represent a few questions that are to be answered. Fourth, the microbiome has been indicated as a precision medicine frontier (Kuntz and Gilbert, 2017) , as interindividual differences in microbiome patterns have been reported, even between co-raised twins. Finally, it is only when enough time-series samples are collected can we answer questions about dynamic patterns for the \"TCM-host-microbiome\" network. Such dynamic pattern is the basis for the \"shelf life\" and \"personalized medicine\" for the microbiome-mediated TCM treatment, and could push for the modernization of TCM.",
