            "text": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the prototype virus of the genus Orbivirus in the family Reoviridae. The virus contains ten double-stranded RNA genome segments each of which codes for a single protein. Seven of the proteins are structural and form a double-shelled particle. Proteins VP3 and VP7 constitute an icosahedral inner capsid that is surrounded by an outer layer composed of proteins VP2 and VP5. In addition to the structural proteins, infected cells contain three non-structural proteins the roles of which remain obscure. French and Roy (1990) constructed a dual-recombinant baculovirus containing genes that encode VP3 and VP7 and their expression in insect cell culture resulted in the synthesis of large quantities of VP3 and VP7 and the concomitant formation of core-like particles (CLP) that lack RNA. CLP have the potential to be used as vaccines against bluetongue and other diseases. Other antigens linked to the VP7 protein, have demonstrated increased antigenicity when presented as part of CLP (Belyaev and Roy, 1992, Pearson and Roy, 1993).",

Quantification of VP3 and VP7 (or VP7-fusion proteins) is not sufficient to indicate the yield of intact CLP present in lysates of infected cells. Existing electron microscopy (EM)-based procedures are cumbersome and difficult to optimise. In this paper, we report the development of an immunosorbent EM procedure for quantifying CLP particles present in crude samples and which precludes a requirement to purify CLP particles prior to quantification.",

Derrick (1973) used parlodion-filmed, carbon-coated grids with anti-potato virus Y (PVY) or anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) antisera to quantify PVY and TMV in crude leaf extracts. He found a linear relationship between the log of the number of TMV particles attached to serologically-specific grids and the dilution of a crude extract of TMV-infected tobacco tissue. Other researchers have also used ISEM to detect and differentiate between different viruses. Lewis (1990) investigated serological differences between strains of Norwalk-like virus (NLV) from five different outbreaks using anti-NLV-coated grids. Dea and Garzon (1991) identified coronaviruses from various species in clarified faecal specimens and Gupta et al.

In this study PTA resulted in the disruption of CLP whereas UA maintained their integrity in addition to generating high contrast images. The choice of antibody was critical to the overall efficiency of the ISEM technique. The best antibody for capturing CLP was MAb 20E9 and its efficiency may be attributable to its specificity and the accessibility of the 20E9 epitope (Wang et al., 1996). The anti-VP7 polyclonal antibody would be expected to recognise multiple epitopes but some are almost certainly inaccessible in CLP, thereby decreasing the capture efficiency of the technique. VP3 is not expressed on the surface of CLP or core particles and therefore anti-VP3 polyclonal antibody would be expected to be inefficient as a capture antibody for CLP.",

These results may be explained in terms of coating density and steric hindrance. At dilutions of and beyond 1:2000 steric hindrance may no longer be an obstacle to CLP binding and the density of antibody adsorption is reduced.The data presented in this paper indicate that the ISEM technique may be useful for quantification of viral antigens in diagnosis and the production of virus vaccines.
