This study, consequently, looks at the nature of graduate IS programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using a direct survey method, IS courses information were collected from the websites of top universities in SSA based on a 2019 webometric world ranking of universities. The course offerings from these universities are mapped to the competencies specified in the Global competency model for graduate IS programmes (MSIS 2016). The findings generally indicate, among others, non-adherence of graduate IS programmes in SSA to the MSIS 2016. The reasons for the non-adherence to the MSIS 2016 curriculum model is recommended for future research.",

Recently, organisations have been concerned with the competencies of IS graduates due to the implications-financial and otherwise -of providing on-the-job (i.e. in-service) training to ensure employees can meet the organisations' competency demands (Anderson 2017) . Stefanidis et al. (2013, p. 1) claim that 'there is an expectation that IS graduates possess sufficient skills to make their transition into graduate employment as seamless as possible'. As a result, organisations are gradually eliminating trainee positions and preferring to hire graduates with the relevant competencies (Anderson 2017) . While this organisational dimension supports expansion and competitiveness, it poses a practical challenge for IS faculty and curriculum developers, who must work to meet the changing demands of businesses in the face of declining IS enrolment (Akbulut-Bailey 2012).",

            "text": "The IS community has responded to organisations' rapidly changing IS competency needs by developing IS competency models to guide the design and delivery of both graduate and undergraduate programmes in higher education institutions (Gorgone et al. 2006; Topi et al. 2017) . While considerable research has examined the level of adoption of IS curriculum models at the undergraduate level (Andoh-Baidoo et al. 2014; Bell et al. 2013; Clark et al. 2017; Lo and Cruz 2014; Mills et al. 2012; Osatuyi and Garza 2014) , there is less research on adoption and adherence at the graduate level (Apigian and Gambill 2014; Yang 2012) . Moreover, much of the domain-specific research is predominantly conducted in the North American context (Helfert 2011) , despite the fact that organisations' IS competency needs differ between regions and regional market factors influence the structure of IS curricula (Larsson and Boateng 2010; Kaiser et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2017) . Yang (2012) suggested that researchers should investigate this topic in non-US universities, preferably in other regions of the world. However, in our preliminary investigation, we found no empirical research on the adoption of the IS competency model in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Additionally, according to Yang (2012) and Apigian and Gambill (2014) , few studies have been on the adoption of the IS competency model at the graduate level, only with the MSIS 2006 (Gorgone et al. 2006) and none with the global competency model for graduate degree programmes (MSIS 2016) (Topi et al. 2017) which is the latest of the curriculum guidelines developed by a joint committee of professionals specifying competencies required from an IS graduate. Quality graduate IS programmes in SSA presents an opportunity to develop contextual solutions to the myriad of problems challenging the region and other less developed countries (Syler and Venkatesh 2018) . In view of these gaps, this paper seeks to understand the nature of graduate IS programmes in SSA and to assess the level of adherence of SSA IS curricula to the MSIS 2016 guidelines. The following research questions are posed: What is the nature of graduate IS programmes in SSA? What courses are offered in graduate IS programmes in SSA to ensure that students attain IS competencies? What is the level of adherence of graduate IS curricula in SSA to the MSIS 2016 guidelines?",

            "text": "Westfall (2012, p. 66) defines IS as a 'field that prepares students to interface between non-technical organizational employees and managers and very technical IT professionals, with a focus on functions that are unlikely to be offshored'. This definition, which we have adopted in the current study, underscores the relevance of understanding the content and curricula of IS programmes in higher education institutions. Research aiming to identify the nature of graduate IS curricula often starts by investigating the nomenclature associated with IS programmes in various institutions (Brooks et al. 2016; Cassel et al. 2008; Longenecker et al. 2015) . IS programmes can be found within various departments of higher education institutions (Longenecker et al. 2015) , and a benchmarking effort in the UK identified more than 6000 different names for computing-related programmes of study and over 150 different names for IS programmes (Cassel et al. 2008) . Brooks et al. (2016) found that the terms IS, management information systems (MIS), computer information systems (CIS) and information technology (IT) refer to the same or similar disciplines, indicating that no effort has been put towards developing a naming convention or standard for IS education. Similarly, Pierson et al. (2008) compared the names of IS programmes in 2004 to 2007 to determine whether there was any convergence in the naming of IS programmes in higher education. They found that MIS, IS and CIS are the dominant names, but 20% of the programmes in the surveyed US schools did not use these names (Pierson et al. 2008) . Given the aim of this paper, we believe it is critical to add to the debate on the identity of the IS field (Agarwal and Lucas 2005; Benbasat and Zmud 2003) and investigate the naming conventions of IS programmes in other regions. This will help researchers understand not only the identity of the IS discipline but also distinguish IS from other computing-related disciplines.",

The most recent model for undergraduate programmes is the IS 2010 (Topi et al. 2010 ) and for graduate programmes is the MSIS 2016 1 global IS competency model (Topi et al. 2017) . The MSIS 2016 model is a revised version of the MSIS 2006 (Gorgone et al. 2006) , which was itself a revision of the MSIS 2000 (Gorgone et al. 2000) . The MSIS 2000 and MSIS 2006 were developed based on the assumptions and principal characteristics regarding IS in the US and Canada. The MSIS 2016 was the first to consider the context of other regions, such as Asia and Europe. Moreover, whereas its antecedents provide specific recommendations, the MSIS 2016 is a meta-model that specifies necessary competencies and provides guidance for the development of IS curricula or models. This follows the recent emphasis on a competency-based approach to IS curriculum design and delivery (Sutcliffe and Chan 2004; Topi 2016; Topi et al. 2011 ). According to Sutcliffe and Chan (2004) , this approach is more flexible than the coursebased approach, which specifies that certain courses must always be taught.",

They found a considerable difference in the schools offering business intelligence courses and degrees in different departments. Another perspective looks at the IS courses offered by universities to provide students with specific IS competencies or promote certain career tracks. Studies adopting this perspective survey universities with IS programmes, and they can be exploratory in nature, be guided by a model or perform comparisons with existing IS model curricula.

Bell et al. (2013, p. 77 ) explained that direct surveys are advantageous because they focus on a 'specific program of interest, allowing systematic collection and quantification of data'. The top 50 universities in SSA were selected based on their rankings by Webometrics (2018) , which is an initiative of the Cybermetrics Lab, a research group belonging to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, which ranks universities by region in order to improve the web presence of academic and research institutions. In this study, the university websites were accessed beginning in September 2018, when the academic calendar for most universities in SSA begin and updated course catalogues are provided. Only English-language websites were selected in this survey. The websites of two universities in the top 50 were in French and were therefore excluded. To fill this gap, we included the 51st and 52nd universities. Since our focus is on graduate programmes, only universities that offered graduate IS programmes were included.",

Such modules are important to help learners from diverse backgrounds transition into the programme (Topi et al. 2017 ). However, this study did not consider the entry requirements for the programmes, and it is therefore difficult to interpret the absence of bridge modules as injurious.

            "text": "The results show that information systems development (ISD) and related courses are widely offered in graduate IS programmes in SSA. This supports Surendra and Denton's (2009) suggestion that the defining course in an IS programme is systems analysis and design, on which the core body of knowledge in the IS field depends (Baskerville and Myers 2002) . The five most common courses providing IS competencies are ISD, IS Research, Strategic IS Management, IS Project Management and IS Security and Auditing. These findings are similar to those of other researchers (Apigian and Gambill 2014; Yang 2012) . Yang (2012) identified IS Analysis/Modelling/Design, IT Infrastructure, Project and Change Management and Management of IS as the four courses most commonly offered in IS programmes by universities in the US, and Apigian and Gambill (2014) identified Database, Management of IS, System Analysis and Design, and Project Management as the most common courses. We compared the courses offered in graduate IS programmes with the MSIS 2016 global competency model. To do so, we mapped the IS courses offered by the universities to the appropriate broad IS competency categories in MSIS 2016 (which are discussed in Sect. 3). The results are summarised in Table 3 . The results show that courses providing competencies within the Data, Information and Content Management (DICM) and Systems Development and Deployment (SDAD) categories have a strong presence in graduate IS curricula in SSA. Fewer courses that cover competencies within the Ethics, Impacts, and Sustainability (ETIS) and the Enterprise Architecture (EARC) categories are provided. Moreover, little attention has been given to the categories Innovation, Organisational Change and Entrepreneurship (IOCE), Business Continuity and Information Assurance (BCIA) and IS Strategy and Governance (ISSG). None of the graduate IS curricula completely followed the MSIS 2016 model. The most adherent curriculum differed by four broad competencies, and the least adherent differed by six. Four of the universities offer courses providing graduate IS competencies in five broad categories, three offer courses that provide competencies in four broad categories and the remaining two offer courses providing competencies in three broad categories. These results are not much different from those of Yang (2012) and Apigian and Gambill (2014) or from studies examining undergraduate programmes (Bell et al. 2013; Clark et al. 2017; Mills et al. 2012) . Apigian and Gambill (2014) found that graduate IS programmes in US universities generally exhibited nonadherence to the MSIS 2006, and Yang (2012) found that course offerings differed from the MSIS 2006 in terms of one category. In a survey of undergraduate IS programmes in the US, Bell et al. (2013) found a wide range of non-adherence to the IS 2010 model. Moreover, a number of non-IS courses were required despite their absence in the IS 2010. Similarly, Stefanidis et al. (2012) found generally low adherence to the IS 2010 in a study of undergraduate IS programmes in the UK. The current study shows that IS graduates from SSA universities may not have the global IS skills specified in the MSIS 2016 and may require interventions to fill the gaps in their skills, which are associated with extra training costs and time to integrate into organisations, making these graduates less likely to be hired. This continues to be a subject of research, and relevant questions have been raised about the usefulness of the IS curriculum model due to the general non-adherence of universities and whether nonadherence can be further explored.",

Individual foundational competency modules were identified in a survey of undergraduate IS programmes in the UK (Stefanidis et al. 2012 ), but not they have not received much attention at the graduate level. A number of studies have advocated for the inclusion of courses in IS curricula that provide individual foundational competencies, including creativity and problem-solving (Martz et al. 2017) , service learning (Jones and Ceccucci 2018) , virtual teamwork (Chen et al. 2008) , intercultural communication (Mitchell and Benyon 2018) and ethics and social responsibility (Harris and Lang 2011). Whilst this study did not consider specialised courses that provide competencies specific to certain career tracks, we found that the programmes included new domains beyond business. However, there were no specific courses providing individual foundation competencies. We observed different levels of adherence of graduate IS programmes to MSIS 2016. Due to the general non-adherence, many graduates of IS programmes in SSA may not have sufficient skills for the workplace. The reasons for non-adherence were not studied in this research and may be explored in future studies. A descriptive survey like this, though valuable, does not provide rich insights into how faculties develop or revise graduate IS curricula. Future research could look at specific case studies of graduate IS curricula similar to those of Gupta et al. (2015) , and Ramesh and Gerth (2015) . Such a study would provide richer insight into the factors that enable or inhibit IS curriculum model adherence than provided by extant literature. These insights could help guide universities in planning graduate IS programmes in SSA. In addition, future research should use all specified competencies during mapping to provide a detailed view of which competencies are provided by courses in graduate IS programmes, moving beyond the broad competencies. Finally, although we compared graduate IS curricula to the competencies specified in MSIS 2016, it is important to understand whether those competencies are exhaustive and relevant to organisations in Africa, as this would guide its adoption or adaptation by universities (Larsson and Boateng 2010) . A future study could consider the views of employers, employees and other stakeholders regarding the value of the competencies specified in MSIS 2016 in SSA.",

The graduate IS programmes generally offer courses providing competencies in SDAD as well as DICM. Courses providing competencies in ETIS and EARC are rare in graduate IS curricula in SSA. Popular core IS courses include ISD, IS Research, Strategic IS Management, IS Project Management and IS Security and Auditing.",
