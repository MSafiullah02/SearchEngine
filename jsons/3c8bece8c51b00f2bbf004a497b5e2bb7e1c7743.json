The consequential decrease in lung function ranges in severity from subclinical to life-threatening or even fatal and can manifest in the acute setting or many years after completion of therapy. Radiation effects are due to direct insult to the pulmonary parenchyma and, for younger children, impaired thoracic musculoskeletal development. Radiation pneumonitis can occur in the acute/subacute setting, as well as fi brosis with comprised gas exchange as a late effect of direct lung irradiation; thoracic wall malformation can cause restriction of function as a chronic sequela. The pulmonary effects of cytotoxic drugs usually present as acute effects, but there is the potential for signifi cant late morbidity and mortality. Of course, surgical interventions can also cause both acute and/or late pulmonary effects as well, depending on the specifi c procedure. Although treatment approaches for the management of pediatric cancers are continually adapted to provide optimal therapy while minimizing toxicities, to a varying degree all therapies have the potential for both acute and late pulmonary toxicity. Of note, the cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications rises with increasing time since diagnosis, which suggests that adult survivors of childhood cancer require lifelong monitoring and management of potential new-onset pulmonary morbidity as they age. Knowledge of cytotoxic therapies and an understanding of lung physiology and how it may be altered by therapy facilitate appropriate clinical care and monitoring of long-term survivors.",

Lung development is a complex process [ 105 ] that begins on day 26 of gestation and continues for at least several years postnatal. During the embryonic period, the primitive lung bud arises from the foregut, elongates caudally, and branches to form the major airways. The pseudoglandular phase follows; the process of branching continues and the smaller airways are formed. Fetal breathing movements are identifi ed as early as 8 weeks, and by the end of this phase, the two lobes of the left lung and three lobes of the right lung can be identifi ed. Cartilage and smooth muscle cells are present, and about half of the epithelial cell types that will eventually comprise the mature lung are identifi able. The airway branching is completed, the interstitial tissue decreases, and prospective gas exchange regions begin to appear during the canalicular phase. A differentiation process occurs in the cuboidal epithelial cells, and Type I and II pneumocytes appear. Type I pneumocytes are the functional exchange unit of the lung, while Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant, a phospholipid substance that serves to decrease surface tension within the Type I cell and prevent it from collapsing. Vascularization of the lung occurs throughout development, and, at this point, the capillaries can be found in close proximity to the pneumocytes. The saccular phase of development extends from 24 weeks through 38 weeks gestation. During this time, there is continued thinning of the connective tissue between the potential air spaces, further maturation of the Type II pneumocytes, and increased surfactant production. Primitive alveoli, lined by both Type I and Type II pneumocytes, can now be identifi ed as pouches in the walls of the saccules and respiratory bronchioles (Table 11 .1 ).",

The septa become thin and grow into air spaces, forming partitions within the pouches. Within a few months the infant's alveoli resemble those of the adult, with greatly increased surface area available for gas exchange. Completion of the vascularization process during this time results in single capillary networks associated with each area of gas exchange [ 118 , 150 ] .

            "text": "Primary lung malignancies are very rare in children; however, the lung is a common site for metastases, sometimes even years after the completion of defi nitive therapy. Therapy-related pulmonary toxicity is due to either local therapies (radiation or surgery) directed at the lung parenchyma and chest wall or chemotherapy that is administered systemically but likewise negatively affects these organs and structures. Of course, many patients receive multimodality treatment that potentially compounds acute and late toxicity. The pathogenesis of pulmonary toxicity secondary to cytotoxic therapy is largely based on animal experimentation. However, it is believed to occur through one of four mechanisms of injury: (1) DNA damage from the drug or radiation itself, (2) damage infl icted by free radical generation, (3) allergic response to the cytotoxic agent, and (4) subsequent injury induced by the infl ammatory response to the primary damage itself. Pulmonary fi brosis, which mediates many of the long-term effects, can arise from collagen deposits that occur after cellular damage. In addition, the breakdown of actual lung tissue can trigger an infl ammatory reaction that activates increased production of elastin by actinexpressing smooth muscle cells. This also results in pulmonary fi brosis. While there are several postulated means of injury to the pulmonary tissue, the common fi nding in all is diffuse alveolar damage. The cytotoxic changes start as endothelial blebs in the alveolar capillaries and lead to capillary leak syndrome. These are then associated with interstitial edema. There is destruction and a resulting decrease in number of Type I pneumocytes, as well as reactive changes and proliferation of Type II pneumocytes. More recently, progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular events after radiation lung injury, leading to clinically and histologically recognizable changes. The process appears to be dynamic and to involve proinfl ammatory cytokines, profi brotic cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in modulating and recruiting immune cells to the sites of radiation lung injury [ 24 ] . Long-term effects on the lungs are the result of this complex process.",

            "text": "Drug-related pulmonary disease may be the result of toxicity, allergy, or idiosyncrasy [ 39 ] . Toxicity, with a dose-response, has been shown for bleomycin, chlorambucil, and the nitrosoureas. Pulmonary damage, likely mediated through allergic mechanisms, is caused by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, procarbazine, and bleomycin. Pulmonary disease has also been associated with mitomycin, cytosine arabinoside, the vinca alkaloids, and alkylating agents. Bleomycin may be the most commonly recognized cause of pulmonary toxicity; the pathogenesis of bleomycin injury has been studied extensively [ 29 , 58 , 71 ] . Lung injury following low-dose bleomycin may be idiosyncratic, possibly attributable to genetically impaired drug metabolism. Having inherently low levels of bleomycin hydrolase [ 76 ] , an enzyme that inactivates bleomycin, the lung is particularly vulnerable to bleomycin injury. Mouse data demonstrate that strain sensitivity to bleomycin is related to different levels of bleomycin hydrolase activity [ 62 ] . Hence, individual variations in bleomycin sensitivity may be explained at least in part by genetically determined levels of bleomycin hydrolase activity. Free radical formation and oxidative damage also play a role in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Fibrosis after bleomycin therapy develops under the infl uence of immune processes that include activation of effector cells, including alveolar macrophages, and release of cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor may play a pivotal role [ 82 , 106 ] . Pathology demonstrates endothelial and Type I cell necrosis with Type II hyperplasia and hyaline membranes. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary effects usually occur during or within a year of treatment.",

The formation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation of phospholipid membranes may also be the mechanism by which cyclophosphamide and mitomycin damage the capillary endothelium [ 28 ] . Permeability increases, resulting in interstitial edema. Hyaline membranes form as plasma proteins, and fl uid enters the alveoli through the denuded epithelium. Type I pneumocytes swell, become necrotic, and are replaced by cuboidal cells. Proliferation of fi broblasts then occurs. This process may evolve slowly, with fi brosis increasing over a period of years. Interstitial pneumonitis (either the desquamative type that appears to be an earlier stage or the usual type with fi brinous exudation, hyaline membranes, and interstitial fi brosis) is also seen with alkylating agents. This pneumonitis may lead to the development of chronic pulmonary fi brosis that is characterized by the enhanced production and deposition of collagen and other matrix components. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, with vasculitis and intimal fi brosis resulting in pulmonary hypertension, has been reported after either bleomycin or mitomycin [ 34 ] .",

The alveoli collapse and are obliterated by connective tissue. The mechanisms of chronic injury may be related to the effects of radiation on the pulmonary vasculature (endothelial cells) or somatic cells. The nature of the triggering event in the pathogenesis of radiation-related lung fi brosis is complex. The classic hypothesis that fi brosis is a connective tissue replacement process following parenchymal cell death has been challenged, and the exact mechanisms of early injuries leading to the late effects are not entirely understood. Cytokinemediated multicellular interactions that initiate and sustain the fi brogenic process take place within hours to days after radiation in animal research models. Experimental data suggest that the progression of the initial lung injury to the pneumonitic phase may be the result of a cytokine and cellular interaction, which subsequently regulates the fi brotic phase of the presentation [ 24 , 127 -129 ] . In addition, it has been recently hypothesized that chronic hypoxia, and the perpetual injury to normal tissue through reactive oxygen species, may also be a contributing mechanism to chronic and progressive fi brosis [ 158 ] . Studies in animals have confi rmed the protective effect of fractionated radiation therapy, which is several small doses of radiation as compared to a comparable dose delivered in a single large treatment, indicating a signifi cant degree of recovery of lung tissue between fractions [ 141 , 160 ] .",

As alveolar-capillary membrane destruction is an integral part of interstitial disease, pulmonary function tests demonstrate a decrease in the measured diffusing capacity [ 135 ] . Pulmonary disease after chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also have an obstructive component. Obstructive diseases result from airway narrowing. This may be due to bronchospasm, mucus, or luminal narrowing as a result of edema and infl ammation or scarring [ 97 ] . Airway narrowing due to disease can be detected as a decrease in expiratory airfl ow.

Signifi cant associations existed between the development of fi brosis and treatment with radiation therapy and between the use of supplemental oxygen, recurrent pneumonia, chronic cough, and pleurisy and treatment with radiation therapy and/or multiple chemotherapy agents [ 92 ] . In regard to mortality, a large retrospective study of greater than 20,000 5-year survivors of childhood cancer reported a significant excess rate of deaths largely due to treatmentrelated causes rather than progression or recurrence of the primary disease; furthermore, pulmonary causes accounted for excess mortality risk (standard mortality ratio, 8.8) second only to death from secondary malignancy (standard mortality ratio, 15.2) [ 7 ] .

Although many of the patients that have been studied received radiation therapy, the intensifi ed use of chemotherapy accounts for some or all of the toxicity in subsets of survivors.

Pulmonary fi brosis occurs in almost 100 % of patients receiving high doses of radiation, but it may not be of clinical signifi cance if the volume is small. The clinically signifi cant presentation of pulmonary toxicity is usually pneumonitis, due to its prevalence and potential morbid outcome. The presentation varies with the type of lung injury present. Often there are complaints of a nonproductive cough, fever, and dyspnea. However, the presentation can also be quite acute with respiratory insuffi ciency and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other presentations include bronchospasm, pleural effusion, bronchiolitis obliterans, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, sarcoidosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, pneumothorax, and pulmonary hemorrhage. When radiation therapy is the only modality used, radiation pneumonitis follows the completion of the defi nitive course of treatment. Cough, pink sputum, dyspnea, and pleuritis are common complaints during the subacute pneumonitic phase, which generally occurs 1-3 months after completion of radiation. When chemotherapy is administered in conjunction with radiation, as in total body irradiation (TBI) and BMT-conditioning regimens, reactions can occur during treatment. The fi brotic phase of radiation injury starts 3-6 months after completion of radiation and is progressive. The clinical manifestations of fi brosis are worsening dyspnea, increasing probability of oxygen dependence, and declining pulmonary function test results.",

It is well described in the adult literature after the treatment of lung cancer [ 5 , 6 , 122 ] , but little of the data from such studies are relevant to modern pediatric cancer therapies. Pneumonitis can occur unexpectedly, with little or no warning. Because of this, many attempts have been made to identify clinical risk factors. The factors that infl uence risk include total lung radiation dose, irradiated lung volume exceeding 20 Gy vs 25 Gy vs 30 Gy, mean lung dose, fractionation of radiotherapy, daily fraction size, performance status, pre-treatment pulmonary function, gender, low pre-treatment blood oxygen, and high C-reactive protein [ 49 , 59 , 64 , 74 , 123 , 125 , 136 ] . Symptoms of subacute pneumonitis syndrome include low-grade fever and nonspecifi c respiratory symptoms such as congestion, cough, and fullness in the chest. In more severe cases, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and nonproductive cough may be present. Later, small amounts of sputum, sometimes bloodstained, may be produced. Physical signs in the chest are usually absent, although a pleural friction rub or pleural fl uid may be detected. Evidence of alveolar infi ltrates or consolidation is sometimes found in the region corresponding to pneumonitis. This results from an acute exudative edema that is initially faint but may progress to homogenous or patchy air space consolidation. Frequently there is an associated volume loss in the affected portion of the lung.",

            "text": "The clinical symptomatology related to the radiographic changes is proportional to the extent of the lung parenchyma involved and preexisting pulmonary reserve. After thoracic radiation, restrictive changes gradually develop and progress with time [ 51 ] . Gas exchange abnormalities occur approximately at the same time as the changes in lung volumes. These abnormalities consist of a fall in diffusion capacity, mild arterial hypoxemia that may manifest only with exercise, and a low or normal PaCO 2 level. The changes appear to be consistent with a parenchymal lung defect and ventilation-perfusion inequality that results in a component of effective shunt [ 52 ] . Radionuclide evaluations have demonstrated that underperfusion, rather than underventilation, is the cause of these inequalities, refl ecting radiation injury to the microvasculature [ 119 , 120 , 157 ] . Larger doses of irradiation cause reductions in lung compliance that start at the time of pneumonitis and persist thereafter [ 117 ] . The compliance of the chest wall is usually much less affected in adults and adolescents than in young children, in whom interference with growth of both lung and chest wall leads to marked reductions in mean total lung volumes and diffusion capacity (DLCO) [ 165 ] . Whole-lung irradiation in doses of 11-14 Gy has resulted in restrictive changes in the lungs of children treated for various malignancies [ 10 , 83 , 93 ] . Consequently, RT in younger children, particularly those younger than 3 years old, results in increased chronic toxicity [ 93 ] . One to 2 years after radiation, clinical symptoms stabilize and are often minimal if fi brosis is limited to less than 50 % of one lung [ 134 ] . A mild deterioration in pulmonary function may be demonstrated as fi brosis develops. There is a reduction in maximum breathing capacity that is particularly evident in patients with bilateral radiation fi brosis. Tidal volume usually decreases, and breathing frequency tends to increase, resulting in an overall moderate increase in minute ventilation [ 139 ] . Most studies have found these changes to persist indefinitely, with little recovery unless there are concurrent improvements in pulmonary function with lung tumor response [ 41 , 45 , 50 ] . Functional compensation by adjacent lung regions [ 100 ] limits the effect of radiation on pulmonary function tests when small volumes of lung are irradiated. Dyspnea and progressive chronic cor pulmonale leading to right heart failure may occur when >50 % of a lung is irradiated.",

Chest radiographs have linear streaking, radiating from the area of previous pneumonitis and sometimes extending outside the irradiated region, with concomitant regional contraction, pleural thickening, and tenting of the diaphragm. The hilum or mediastinum may be retracted with a densely contracted lung segment, resulting in compensatory hyperinfl ation of the adjacent or contralateral lung tissue. This is usually seen 12 months to 2 years after radiation. When chronic fi brosis occurs in the absence of an earlier clinically evident pneumonitic phase [ 113 , 126 , 140 ] , chest radiography generally reveals scarring that corresponds to the shape of the radiation portal. Eventually, dense fi brosis can develop, especially in the area of a previous tumor [ 127 ] . CT is currently favored to image regions subjected to RT [ 81 , 85 , 155 ] . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being explored and may have promise in accurately distinguishing radiation fi brosis from recurrent tumor.

They showed that, using an increase in lung density within the irradiated volume on CT in the posttreatment period as an endpoint, each 5 % increase in effective dose was associated with a 12 % increase in the incidence of pneumonitis. Doses above 30 Gy over a period of 10-15 days, and 45-50 Gy over a period of 25-30 days, caused radiographic changes in 30-90 % of patients. The need for a clinical guideline in estimating radiation injury prompted the collaborative work by a task force to address the normal tissue tolerance in the standard, fractionated radiation setting. Information was obtained from a diverse group of patients affl icted with various diseases of the thoracic region, but mostly from patients with Hodgkin's disease, lung cancer, or a disease requiring large-volume irradiation (hemibody or total body radiation) [ 37 ] . The doses agreed on by the physicians in the taskforce are shown in Table 11 .2 . It is important to note that these values were defi ned for adult, not pediatric, patients. More recently, as part of the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) effort, a logistic regression fi tted to radiation pneumonitis vs mean lung dose was created from data from all published studies, again, predominantly involving adult patients, of a signifi cant size that had extractable complication rates binned by mean dose (Fig. 11.2 ) . The authors note that some of the variation around the fi tted curve is possibly explained by differences in patient selection, as well as differences in the grade of RP reported in the various studies; however, there is a relatively small 68 % confidence interval (stippled lines). Of importance is the gradual increase in dose-response, which suggests that there is no absolute \"safe\" mean lung dose below which pneumonitis is certain not to develop.",

One study in children with rhabdomyosarcoma exposed to bleomycin demonstrated an incidence of toxicity of 70 % based on decreased DLCO [ 67 ] . A risk factor for bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity is the cumulative dose with a 10 % risk at doses of 400-500 IU/m 2 [ 14 , 132 ] although injury may occur at doses as low as 20 IU/m 2 . The elderly [ 14 ] and children or adolescents [ 44 ] may be more sensitive, especially when bleomycin is administered in conjunction with RT. Of children treated for Hodgkin's disease with 70-120 IU/m 2 of bleomycin [ 44 ] , 9 % had grade 3 or 4 pulmonary toxicity, according to DLCO. Three patients (5 %) had clinical symptomatology, and one patient died. Only one patient had received RT. Although pediatric trials now use a signifi cantly lower maximal dose than many adult studies, 80 % of the drug is excreted by the kidney, which can result in an increased risk of toxicity due to renal insuffi ciency [ 114 , 143 ] . Other chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vincristine [ 8 , 121 ] may also increase risk. Exposure to high levels of oxygen or to pulmonary infection, especially within a year of treatment, is associated with a risk for immediate progressive respiratory failure [ 47 ] . Risks associated with surgery after treatment with bleomycin may be due to fl uid overload [ 35 ] . These risks may persist for longer periods of time. There may be a potential increase in pulmonary toxicity with the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is mediated via the increased numbers of neutrophils [ 30 ] .",

Fibrosis may be early onset or late onset. Radiation therapy also increases risk, as does underlying pulmonary abnormality, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although this is rarely a factor in children. Bone marrow transplant patients may develop pulmonary fi brosis with BCNU as one of the contributing etiologies [ 103 ] . As part of a preparative regimen including etoposide and melphalan, BCNU at 600 mg/m 2 was associated with unacceptable pulmonary toxicity, but doses of 450 mg/m 2 were tolerated in the acute period [ 2 ] . Chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplant may induce infl ammatory changes that render the lung more susceptible to further, potentially irreversible, injury with high-dose therapy [ 12 ] . Although pulmonary fi brosis has been most commonly associated with BCNU, it has been described after other nitrosoureas as well [ 13 , 33 ] . Bibasilar rales with a bibasilar reticular pattern may be seen on chest radiograph, and restrictive ventilatory defects are seen as well. Abnormalities may be restricted to the upper lobes. A decreased diffusion capacity may precede all other signs [ 137 ] . Discontinuation of therapy may alter the course of BCNU-induced pulmonary disease. However, once pulmonary infi ltrates are noted, the disease may be irreversible [ 162 ] . In a documented study, 47 % of survivors of childhood brain tumors treated with BCNU and radiation died of lung fi brosis, 12 % within 3 years of treatment, and the remainder 6-17 years posttreatment. Additional patients were known to have pulmonary fi brosis and remained at risk for late decompensation. In this study, age was a risk factor. The median age of the patients who died was 2.5 years, while the median age of survivors was 10 years. In fact, all patients treated under the age of 5 years had died [ 104 ] .",

Obstructive disease is less common, as is the recently described lateonset pulmonary syndrome, which includes the spectrum of restrictive and obstructive disease. Bronchiolitis obliterans, with or without organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and interstitial pneumonia, may occur as a component of this syndrome, generally 6-12 months after transplant. Cough, dyspnea, or wheezing may occur with either normal chest radiograph or diffuse or patchy infi ltrates; however, most patients are symptom-free [ 78 , 162 ] . Cerveri et al.

The study found that children who underwent surgery before the age of 5 years had ventilatory capacity close to what would be predicted for two lungs, which the authors argue suggests that compensatory growth by way of hyperplasia might have been the most important adaptive mechanism in this group. Perhaps more surprisingly, even in the patients who underwent surgery between the ages of 6 and 20 years, a signifi cant difference was still found as compared to the group of patients operated on at an older age, which indicates that in this period compensatory growth, possibly simple hypertrophy, still played an important but gradually decreasing role.",

Testing the effects of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, Phillips and colleagues [ 116 ] reported that the administration of dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and, to a lesser extent, vincristine enhanced the lethal potential of thoracic irradiation. The effect of dactinomycin was seen when given as long as 30 days before irradiation, but it was not seen when given 30 days after the irradiation. The administration of bleomycin and lung irradiation together produces lung toxicity that is more common and severe than when either agent is given alone. Catane [ 20 ] found pulmonary toxicity in 19 % of patients, and it was fatal in 10 %. This toxicity appears to be maximal when bleomycin is given concurrently with radiation [ 36 ] . Although 500 IU of bleomycin without RT can be lethal in 1-2 % of patients, as little as 30 IU can be fatal when given with RT. The effects of RT are also potentiated by doxorubi-cin. In addition to the enhanced toxicity observed in skin, intestines, and heart, the lung also appears to be very sensitive to this combination [ 18 , 22 ] . Of 24 patients with lung cancer treated with low-dose doxorubicin and RT, 13 developed pneumonitis [ 156 ] .",

When chronic fi brosis occurs, chest radiography generally reveals scarring that corresponds to the shape of the radiation portal. CT scans have the capability of presenting three-dimensional images and calculating three-dimensional volumes of functional lung in a defi ned range of Hounsfi eld units. One can also detect small infi ltrates that may be adjacent to the chest wall, for example, in the case of tangential fi eld RT, where infi ltrates are calculated as a percentage of the total lung volume. Mah [ 85 ] has shown a quantitative relationship between the volume of abnormality on CT and RT dose (converted to a single dose equivalent). Radiographic changes after chemotherapy are often bibasilar fi brosis. Fibrosis confi ned to the upper lobes has also been described after treatment with BCNU [ 110 ] and bleomycin [ 88 ] .",

Smokers who responded to the study expressed a higher desire to quit than the general population. Interventions have been developed and studied to decrease smoking and improve smoking cessation in long-term survivors [ 38 , 153 ] . Similarly, parents and caregivers of children with cancer should be encouraged to avoid exposing their children to environmental tobacco smoke.

Supportive care with bronchodilators, expectorants, antibiotics, bed rest, and oxygen can be benefi cial for relief of symptoms in pneumonitis and fi brosis. In cases of radiation or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis in which corticosteroids have been used, it is important to withdraw steroids very slowly to avoid reactivation.

There is increasing evidence of immune cells augmenting pneumonitis through complex autocrine, paracrine, and systemic regulatory mechanisms critically orchestrated by cytokines [ 24 , 129 ] . Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in pneumonitis and fi brosis will allow for timely intervention and proper protection. Interferons and other cytokines that oppose or inhibit fi brosis-promoting growth factors potentially may be used during therapy, resulting in the desired enhanced therapeutic ratio. Chemoprotective agents are being investigated for their ability to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy, including lung injury. It is essential, of course, that they do not disturb the effi cacy of the treatment. Improvement of radiotherapy targeting and normal tissue sparing, such as threedimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), will minimize radiation to nontarget normal lung tissue. Novel interventions, such as mechanisms to increase the level of bleomycin hydrolase in susceptible patients or viral-mediated transfer of a bleomycin resistance gene, may hold promise for future applications in clinical treatment. What may prove to be the most important is the recognition of those at enhanced risk for long-term pulmonary toxicity as a result of their genotype. Understanding of such risk factors could lead to therapy tailored to an individual risk profi le.",
