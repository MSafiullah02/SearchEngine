There are about 20 million people living in Shenzhen, of which the external population from the internal area of China, including Hubei province, account for a large proportion. High population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility may increase the possibility of COVID-19 outbreak [7, 8]. The first COVID-19 patient in Shenzhen was admitted on January 9, 2020, and 419 cases have been confirmed by March 7, 2020, which ranked the top cities outside Wuhan. Most of these patients were imported cases from Hubei province, and there was no large-scale transmission and nosocomial infection in Shenzhen until now.",

Taking account of the incubation period (mostly 3\u20137 days, with mean of 3.7 days) and the time between symptom onset and confirm of the diagnosis (6 day on average) [13, 14], the peak of new confirmed cases coincided with the implementation of serial preventive strategy and measures, indicating these preventive strategies and measures were effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei on January 23 and the next few days was also important for the reduction of imported cases in Shenzhen, which reduces the difficulty of prevention in Shenzhen. Most of the imported cases after the lockdown left Hubei before January 23 and arrived at Shenzhen later, which leaded to the increasing of imported cases in a few days after January 23 (fig. 1). Meanwhile, there was no infection among medical staff or patients infected in hospital environment in Shenzhen hospitals until March 7.",
