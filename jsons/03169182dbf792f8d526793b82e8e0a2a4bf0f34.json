            "text": "RNA silencing, including RNA interference, is a novel method of gene regulation and one of the potent host-defense mechanisms against the viruses. In the course of evolution, the viruses have encoded proteins with the potential to suppress the host RNA silencing mechanism as a counterdefense strategy. The virus-encoded RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs) can serve as important biological tools to dissect the detailed RNA silencing pathways and also to evolve the antiviral strategies. Screening and identification of the RSSs are indeed of utmost significance in the field of plant biotechnology. We describe two Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter-based plant assay systems that rely on two different principles, namely reversal of silencing and enhancement of rolling circle replication (RCR) of geminiviral replicon. These proof-of-concept examples and assay systems could be used to screen various plant, animal, and insect viral ORFs for identification of the RSS activities.",

            "text": "RNA silencing is one of the major adaptive defense responses of the eukaryotic systems (1,2). It is triggered by long dsRNA and targets the homologous ssRNA in a sequence-specific manner. The enzyme Dicer, a prime component of the RNA silencing machinery, degrades the long dsRNA into 20-30-mer short RNAs, known as small interfering RNAs or siRNAs. These siRNAs form a complex with a large repertoire of proteins, known as RISC, which pair with cognate transcripts to slice them up (3) (4) (5) . In some cases, RNA silencing postviral infection results in a host \"recovery\" phenotype, in which the newly emerging leaves lack viral symptoms and remain substantially free of virus. Additionally, the RNA silencing processes in response to one mild virus may cross-protect the infected plant against virulent infection by another related virus carrying sequences homologous to the pre-infecting one (6), a phenomenon scripted by the plant virologists long ago in the 1920s. All such phenomena are now generally known as virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Moreover, the plant mutants defective in one or several of the RNA silencing pathways are found to show enhanced susceptibility to virus infection (7-10). RNA silencing is also one of the major principles behind \"pathogenderived resistance\" (PDR) against viruses. In recent years, the viral ORFs have been used as transgenes of inverted repeats with intervening introns to ensure production of viral siRNAs within the transgenic plants. Such plants mount robust resistance against the challenge viruses harboring the genomic sequences similar to those of the transgenes. These facts essentially advocate the antiviral characteristics of RNA silencing.",

            "text": "However, the viruses have also evolved to overcome this strong host-defense response of RNA silencing and cause severe pathogenic symptoms and diseases. Moreover, there is evidence of synergism during co-infection, where the weak viral symptoms are magnificently aggravated following synergism (11). The virus-resistant transgenic plants based on the RNA silencing principle could also succumb to viral infection as a result of synergistic co-infection. There are certain viral proteins that neither directly support the replication of the viral genome nor fall under classical pathogenicity factors, but are found to be important for the establishment of disease (12). The transgenic plants expressing such viral proteins are more susceptible to viral infection than the wild-type plants; and the viruses defective for such proteins are either less virulent than the wild-type counterparts or are completely disabled in growth by host RNA silencing processes (13-15). These facts cumulatively underscore the point that viruses encode a few proteins to counteract the host RNA silencing and these proteins confer pathogenicity to the viruses. These proteins are known as RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs). The potyvirus HC-Pro protein was the first RSS to be identified (16) and then five more RSSs were reported in 1999 (17). Since then a large number of suppressors (about 45) have been identified from plant, animal, as well as insect viruses (18).",

However, besides the commonality that they can suppress RNA silencing, they differ in evolution, origin, sequence, protein 3D-structure, and modes of action. Thus, identification and characterization of suppressors from individual virus groups are needed. The RSSs can also be used to decipher the detailed pathway of RNA silencing as different suppressors act at different biochemical steps of RNA silencing. The screening of virus ORFs for RSS activity is also essential to design virus resistance strategy, as the RSS encoding virus would not easily succumb to RNA silencing strategy. The identified RSS can also be used to enhance transgenic protein production, as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) has been found to be one of the limiting factors for transgene expression (19) .",

Various ORFs of the viral origin are allowed to ectopically express in the leaves of the silent plant following agro-inoculation. In some cases the ectopic expression will lead to reversion of silenced phenotype, i.e., GFP expression. The reversion of expression can also be monitored by Northern analyses.

When the resultant plasmid (say, pCAMBIA-VA/GFP) is introduced in the leaves of N. xanthi by agroinoculation, the DNA spaced between the two CRs excise out to form a replicating episomal circle. The Rep protein of MYMIV essentially mediates this excision and subsequent initiation of replication (RCR). The amount of DNA replication can be measured by three independent means, as mentioned later. The episomal replication and consequent GFP fluorescence are detected within a week of agro-inoculation at the inoculated spot, but the fluorescence disappears at two weeks' postinoculation due to silencing of the GFP transcripts and short life-span of the GFP protein. The silencing effect is even more potent when the AC2 of VA is mutated, confirming the nature of AC2 as an RNA silencing suppressor. This disappearance, however, can be restored if the RNAi-suppressor-expressing construct could be co-introduced along with the pCAMBIA-VA/GFP construct using the Agrobacterial route. In the presence of the suppressor, more episomal replication along with the stable GFP fluorescence is observed even at four weeks' postinoculation.",

However, the GFP-siRNA level is higher for the empty vector, SARS-3a, and SARS-N and lower with FHV-B2, MYMIV-AC2, and SARS-7a. These findings corroborate well with the fluorescence data, thereby proving the RSS activity of FHV-B2, MYMIV-AC2, and SARS-7a. The reversal of the silencing assay is indeed a very easy and reliable method to screen and identify various viral ORFs with RSS activity.",

A GFP transcription unit of 1.4 kb consisting of 35S promoter, GFP ORF, and the transcription terminator was prepared keeping the MYMIV-based replicon and the CR at the flanking ends of the transcription unit as shown in Fig. 1b . The resulting construct, when introduced in plants, generated an independently replicating episomal circle of 3.2 kb (Fig. 3a) (20,21) . The circle could be detected as a 3.2-kb Southern band and could be distinguished from the unreplicated DNA that would reveal as a \u223c4 kb band (Fig. 3c) . The presence of the circle could also be confirmed from a PCR band of 1.6 kb using a set of divergent primers as mentioned later. There won't be any PCR amplification from the unreplicated DNA using the same set of primers (Figs. 3a, 3d) . At the initial phase of episomal replication, the GFP accumulates showing the green fluorescence in the leaves harboring the replicated DNA. However, around 12 d.p.i., the GFP fluorescence starts fading, showing the signs of GFP silencing (Fig. 3b) . At three weeks' postreplication, the GFP fluorescence is almost lost. Thus, the GFP serves as a marker of the initial phase of replication, as its expression would be directly proportional to the replication of the episome by RCR. The primary plasmid construct, which is introduced in the plant using agro-inoculation, is named VA/GFP and its backbone is pCAMBIA 1391Z (Fig. 3a) .",

(d) No reversion of silencing if infiltration was carried out with nonsuppressor construct. at \u223c510 nm. The molecular analyses involved probing the mRNA and siRNA levels of GFP in the presence and absence of the viral ORFs. 1. The GFP-silenced Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi can be made by Agrobacteriummediated transformation of the wild-type Nicotiana plant using the pBI121-GFP constructs. A transgenic event is selected in which the chromosomally integrated GFP gene is silent in expression in Nicotiana xanthi. The transgenics are screened for loss of fluorescence following UV irradiation on leaves, while the presence of the GFP gene is confirmed by both PCR and Southern analyses. We also confirm the silencing by the very low level of GFP-mRNA and the high level of GFP-siRNA in the Northern blots of the RNAs isolated from the silent plants. The young leaves of the transgenic plant are used for the screening assay. 2. Take up the homogeneous culture suspension of Agrobacterium constructs (obtained in Section 3.1) in a 5-mL needleless syringe. Infiltrate the selected young leaf using the culture suspension and by generating a vacuum with the help of a finger on the dorsal side of the leaf and mouth of the syringe on the ventral side. As the vacuum is created, push the plunger of the syringe to transfer the culture into the leaf through the stomata pores without detachment of the leaf from the plant (see Notes 2 and 3). Label each agro-infiltrated leaf for the construct used for infiltration. A plant should not be infiltrated for more than two ORFs for best results (see Note 4). 3. Pluck the inoculated leaves from the plant starting from 4 days' postinfiltration (d.p.i.) for fluorescence and biochemical analyses. The incubation period is required for the optimum expression and suppression activity of the viral ORF (see Note 5). 4. Visualize the leaves under UV for fluorescence. In case of an empty vector (pBI121), SARS 3a and N, the infiltrated zone will appear red at any time postinfiltration, while the MYMIV-AC2, FHV-B2, and SARS-7a infiltrated zones will fluoresce green at about 8 d.p.i.
