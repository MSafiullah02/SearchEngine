A rapid transit scheme also occurs in the immune system to allow immediate activation of the immune cells toward microbes, transient mode of action, and swift recovery. Post\u2010transcriptional regulation contributes significantly to this rapid transit by several mechanisms, including mRNA stability modulation and translational control; collectively, they aim to control the expression of key gene products involved in the immune response. Sequence elements, mainly in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR), and modulation by RNA\u2010binding proteins can affect mRNA stability and protein translation. Many of the gene products involved in the immune system, such as cytokines, harbor destabilization sequence elements in the mRNA, mostly adenylate\u2010uridylate (AU)\u2010rich elements (AREs), which comprise a heterogeneous group of sequence classes that can affect protein interactions with the mRNAs and therefore influence the mRNA decay characteristics [\n1\n, \n2\n].",

The stabilization of cytokine mRNA and other immune response gene products can occur by the activity of mRNA stabilization\u2010promoting proteins such as human antigen (HuR) protein or by inactivation of RNA decay\u2010promoting proteins such as the zinc finger protein, tristetraprolin (TTP). HuR is one of the most characterized RNA\u2010binding proteins; it is a mammalian homologue of embryonic, lethal, abnormal vision proteins, which was first described in Drosophila. It is implicated in the stabilization of many AU\u2010rich mRNAs including those that participate in immunity and inflammation such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20103, IL\u20108, and the urokinase activator, urokinase\u2010type plasminogen activator [\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n]. Among RNA\u2010binding proteins that promote mRNA decay is TTP. It is an endotoxin\u2010inducible, early response gene product, which destabilizes several proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs including TNF\u2010\u03b1, GM\u2010CSF, and IL\u20102 by binding to a specific class of AREs in the 3\u2032UTR. In addition to TTP, K\u2010homology splicing\u2010regulatory protein (KSRP [\n9\n]), butyrate response factor (BRF1 [\n10\n]), and certain gene products of the ARE RNA\u2010binding protein 1 [ARE/poly(U)\u2010binding/degradation factor 1 (AUF1)] family [\n2\n] are considered negative\u2010feedback mediators. TTP and several other RNA\u2010binding proteins appear to function by targeting AU\u2010rich mRNA to the exosome, a multiprotein complex with 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoRNase activity representing a major degradation machine in eukaryotes [\n11\n]. ARE\u2010binding proteins can also function by recruitment of degradation factors other than the exosome [\n12\n, \n13\n]. An alternative pathway of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 decay can also occur during degradation of AU\u2010rich mRNAs in cytoplasmic RNA foci\u2014processing bodies [\n14\n]. After a brief introduction about the major signaling pathway regulating mRNA turnover, the review is structured in such a way that reflects key functions of the immune cells, including recognition by innate immunity and T cell activation.",

The p38 MAPK pathway is one of the most common pathways that regulates mRNA stability in multiple cell types. Recent work extends the role of the p38 MAPK pathway and its downstream target kinase, MAPK\u2010activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) [\n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n]. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway drives the accumulation of TTP via the stabilization of TTP mRNA and protein [\n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n]. Although this remains controversial [\n22\n], MK2\u2010mediated phosphorylation of TTP has been reported to impair its function, possibly as a result of reduced binding affinity with the TNF\u2010\u03b1 ARE region [\n18\n, \n23\n]. Another p38 MAPK downstream target with structural and functional similarity to MK2 is MK3; it is thought to cooperate with MK2 in TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA stabilization [\n24\n]. TTP and other RNA decay\u2010promoting proteins, namely BRF1, KSRP, and AUF1, particularly when phosphorylated, are complexed with 14\u20103\u20103 proteins that influence their subcellular localization and mRNA decay activity [\n10\n, \n16\n, \n25\n]. Another player in the post\u2010transcriptional regulation of the immune system by the p38 MAPK pathway is the downstream MAPK signal\u2010integrating kinase, mnk1; this kinase is thought to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 [\n26\n, \n27\n].",

Cytokines can regulate immune response via positive\u2010 and negative\u2010feedback circuits. In general, when cytokines amplify a specific immune response, they tend to stabilize mRNAs that participate in such a process. Examples of those cytokines are the proinflammatory cytokines, IL\u20101\u03b1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, which have been found to stabilize a significant number of cytokines and chemokines, including IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010inducible protein 10 (IP\u201010), growth\u2010related oncogene proteins, and fractalkine (SCYD1), and several genes involved in regulation of inflammatory responses such as TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced protein 3, NF\u2010\u03baB\u03b1I, and mannose\u2010binding lectin 2 (MBL2) [\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n]. Cytokines use p38 MAPK signaling and notably, its target MK2 to trigger mRNA stabilization. For example, using this pathway, IFN\u2010\u03b3 amplifies immune responses such as increasing NK activity and up\u2010regulating MHC expression [\n31\n]. In several inflammatory conditions, other cytokines can amplify inflammatory responses via post\u2010transcriptional mechanisms. IL\u201017A, in a p38 MAPK\u2010dependent manner, can increase the stability of TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced IL\u20108 mRNA in human airway smooth muscle, a process that is important in development of asthma [\n32\n, \n33\n]. IL\u20101, in addition to activated platelets, triggers stabilization of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX\u20102) mRNA with concomitant cytoplasmic accumulation and increased binding of HuR to the AREs of COX\u20102 mRNA in monocytes [\n33\n]. In general, stabilization of the mRNA targets seems to occur after translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon cellular activation [\n34\n].",

Recognition and effector mechanisms of innate immunity encompass post\u2010transcriptional gene regulation, which amplifies the much\u2010needed, early response and enforces the transient response. Efficient recognition of the foreign antigens in microbes, such as bacterial surface molecules and viral dsRNA, is accomplished by cells of the innate immunity, notably macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). Members of the TLR family [\n35\n, \n36\n], which have gained considerable attention in recent years, are responsible for triggering the efficient response of the host cell to microbes.",

            "text": "Traditionally, post\u2010transcriptional regulation in innate immunity has been studied in response to the bacterial endotoxin, LPS, which binds CD14 in a complex with TLR4 on the surface of neutrophils and macrophages and initiates a cascade of signals that causes cell activation, the inflammatory response, and phagocytosis [\n35\n]. Recent work gives further insights into LPS\u2010induced pathways. Upon activation of TLR4 by LPS, the adaptor protein MyD88 is recruited to the receptor and couples with IL\u20101 receptor\u2013associated kinase (IRAK)1 and \u20104, causing IRAK activation and recruitment into a complex with TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 6 (TRAF6). This pathway ultimately culminates in a cascade of signaling events including NF\u2010\u03baB activation, MAPK activation, and transcriptional activation of proinflammatory cytokines [\n37\n]. Engagement of LPS with TLR4 can itself lead to stabilization of its own mRNA, resulting in a LPS amplification response. Although this has been shown in the case of vascular smooth muscle cells when exposed to LPS [\n38\n], it is likely to occur with cells of the innate immune system. TLR4 activation causes HuR translocation to the cytoplasm, enhanced binding of HuR to the 3\u2032UTR, and increased stability of TLR4 mRNA [\n38\n]. The adaptor molecule MyD88, which transduces a signal from TLR, causes stabilization of cytokine mRNAs, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20108, and IP\u201010 in macrophages when stimulated by IFN\u2010\u03b3 [\n29\n]. MyD88 bridges IFN\u2010\u03b3 receptor 1 and mixed linkage kinase 3 domains, leading to p38 MAPK activation [\n31\n]. LPS\u2010induced TLR4 activation can increase formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) mRNA stability via a PI\u20103K pathway in phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes, leading to infiltration to sites where the invading bacteria possess the formyl peptide ligands [\n39\n, \n40\n]. Thus, TLR4 activation encompasses several post\u2010transcriptional, positive regulatory events, which lead to amplification of LPS\u2010induced signaling and ultimately, production of proinflammatory cytokines (\nFig. 1\n). These cytokines and other mediators, including vascular endothelial growth factor, the solute carrier family 11 member 1, and NO, can be up\u2010regulated at the level of mRNA stability in LPS\u2010stimulated, monocytic cells [\n30\n, \n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n]. Cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101, IL\u20106, and IL\u20108 not only contribute to effector mechanisms of innate immunity but also help the activation of adaptive immunity.",

TTP knockout mice having macrophages and neutrophils, which release higher levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and GM\u2010CSF, display diseases associated with TNF\u2010\u03b1 over secretion such as inflammatory arthritis [\n45\n].

This is attributed to the inability to degrade the mRNAs efficiently as a result of absence of AUF1. Although HuR is an RNA stabilization protein, it can have a negative modulatory function in specific situations. This effect has been shown to suppress specific, proinflammatory mRNA targets such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and COX\u20102, using in vivo models with conditional overexpression in macrophage subpopulations [\n49\n].

It binds TLR9 on DC, neutrophils, monocytes, and also, in airway epithelia cells triggering a signal transduction cascade similar to those in response to LPS [\n50\n, \n51\n, \n52\n]. Cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 synergize with CpG DNA to induce IL\u20108 production in airway epithelia, mainly by p38 MAPK activation and stability of IL\u20108 mRNA [\n51\n]. CpG DNA can augment DC function and maturation using post\u2010transcriptional mechanisms. For example, CpG DNA increases MHC I mRNA stability in DC by an IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2\u2010dependent process [\n52\n]. HuR binds to a defined, secondary RNA element in the DC mRNA of CD83 and increases its protein expression [\n53\n]. However, this effect does not involve mRNA stabilization, probably as a result of lack of AREs in CD83 3\u2032UTR [\n1\n] but most likely because of enhanced, chromosome region maintenance 1\u2010mediated translocation of CD83 mRNA to the cytoplasm by HuR [\n53\n]. Mature DC, which express CD83, are efficient in the stimulation of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. So, these post\u2010transcriptional, regulation events contribute to the efficient maturation of DC\u2014cells, which are important APCs\u2014and further, aid bridging innate immunity to adaptive immunity.",

Viruses can stabilize mRNAs of gene products that are essential to the virus life cycle. HSV infection can lead to stabilization of the ARE\u2010mRNA, termed immediate early response 3 (IEX\u20101), probably by means of its transregulatory protein ICP27, which is essential in HSV early gene expression [\n55\n, \n56\n]. The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of EBV is a major player in the induction of cytokines, which in turn, support the growth and survival of the EBV\u2010infected B cells. LMP1 activates the p38 MAPK pathway and stabilizes IP\u201010 [\n57\n]. The Kaposi sarcoma (KS) herpes virus (KSHV or HSV\u20108), which causes angioproliferative regions in immunocompromised patients such as AIDS and transplant patients, promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Using a two\u2010hybrid system, the KSHV latent protein kaposin B has been shown to interact with the c\u2010lobe of the activation domain of MK2 and requires both of the two proline\u2010rich, 23\u2010amino acid direct repeats in kaposin B [\n58\n, \n59\n].

A possible mechanism is that HCV, in a similar manner to dsRNA, which is an intermediate viral product, may activate the retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) pathway, leading to IL\u20108 mRNA stabilization. RIG\u2010I along with melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5, which has been a focus of research in recent years, are RNA helicases, recognizing viral dsRNA and triggering IFN response [\n61\n]. Two recent studies have shown that RIG\u2010I can distinguish viral, uncapped ssRNA from cellular mRNAs [\n62\n, \n63\n]. These proteins and their adaptors have been explored largely for their transcriptional induction of IFN regulatory factor 3\u2010dependent IFN and NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010mediated proinflammatory cytokines when compared with post\u2010transcriptional effects. Recently, it has been shown that a constitutively active RIG\u2010I protein, RIG\u2010N, stabilizes TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced IL\u20108 mRNA and increases reporter activity from a construct that is fused with ARE\u2010bearing, IL\u20108 3\u2032UTR [\n64\n]. IL\u20108 is a proinflammatory cytokine, which appears to exaggerate HCV\u2010induced hepatitis. Thus, HCV\u2010driven stabilization of IL\u20108 mRNA may explain, at least in part, the increased IL\u20108 levels seen in the sera of HCV patients and those that are nonresponsive to IFN therapy [\n65\n].",

One signal is provided upon the engagement of TcR with the antigen presented with MHC on APCs. The other is delivered by costimulatory molecules, such as lymphocyte function\u2010associated protein 1 (LFA\u20101), CD2, and CD28 on T cells, when they interact with cognate receptors on the APCs. With these two signals, the result is AP\u20101 (c\u2010fos/Jun) induction and commitment production of IL\u20102, the hallmark of T cell activation and differentiation [\n72\n]. Post\u2010transcriptional control plays an important regulatory role in almost all of the events that lead to transcriptional activation (\nFig. 2\n). A large proportion of genes is regulated by mRNA stability, as revealed with the large\u2010scale, gene\u2010expression profiling in activated T cells [\n73\n, \n74\n]. One of the most important signaling events in T cell activation that results in stabilization of cytokines, such as IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and GM\u2010CSF, is induced by the costimulatory CD28 [\n75\n]. This signaling pathway does not only increase the promoter activity of the cytokines [\n76\n] but also stabilizes their mRNAs [\n75\n]. The increased IL\u20102 mRNA stability is thought to be controlled differently and independent of the PI\u20103K\u2010dependent induction of the IL\u20102 promoter [\n77\n, \n78\n]. Unlike IL\u20102 transcription, CD28\u2010induced stabilization of the IL\u20102 mRNA and possibly other cytokine mRNAs does not require membrane colocalization with the TcR within CD28 in a multimolecular signaling complex, the central supramolecular activation cluster [\n72\n, \n77\n]. The role of TTP in IL\u20102 production during T cell activation has been studied in detail [\n79\n]. The TcR/CD28\u2010engaged or \u2010immobilized, anti\u2010CD3\u2010induced T cells derived from TTP knockout mice have elevated IL\u20102 levels as a result of increased stabilization of the IL\u20102 mRNA [\n79\n].

Like CD28, when LFA\u20101 on T cells binds to ICAM\u20101 on APCs, allowing strong adhesion between the two cells and promoting efficient T cell activation [\n80\n], it stabilizes certain cytokine mRNAs [\n81\n].",

This protein isomerizes specific peptide bonds and thus, alters protein folding and activity; when it becomes activated in TcR/CD28\u2010stimulated CD4 T cells, it associates concurrently with AUF1 and HuR. This results in stabilization of GM\u2010CSF mRNA as a result of the loss of the mRNA decay\u2010promoting activity of AUF1, which is linked to the exosome (Fig. 2) . AUF1 may be isomerized by pin1, allowing the stabilizing action of HuR to predominate [\n83\n]. AUF1 is a nucleocytoplasmic\u2010shuttling protein and is associated with stabilization and destabilization activities; this appears to be dependent on the AUF1 isoform generated from four alternative\u2010spliced mRNAs and the cell type in question. For example, when AUF1 p37 and p42 isoforms are overexpressed, they bind to IL\u20106 3\u2032UTR, facilitated by a putative RNA stem\u2010loop structure; this process promotes the stabilization of IL\u20106 mRNA [\n85\n].",

Thus, one can envision that for CD28\u2010 or LFA\u20101\u2010induced stabilization to occur following T cell activation, TTP destabilization action must cease. This can happen by either or both of two scenarios: coordinated stabilization\u2010destabilization kinetics and TTP phosphorylation (Fig. 2) . With the coordinated kinetics model, stabilizing RNA\u2010binding proteins such as HuR can occur initially following immune cell activation, allowing rapid and early response of cytokine production. This is followed by the action of mRNA\u2010destabilizing proteins such as TTP, resulting in transient cytokine production. HuR translocation following TcR/CD28 engagement is seen, first within 1 h, and TTP is induced in activated T cells in a later time [\n86\n]. There is also the potential for interesting reciprocal regulation, which helps to amplify this \u201ccycle\u201d; HuR may stabilize TTP mRNA itself, thus helping to prime TTP for its destabilizing action on cytokine mRNAs. TTP has also been suggested to regulate the stability of its own mRNA in different cell types [\n20\n, \n21\n], although this has not been proved conclusively [\n4\n]; it is also possible that this regulation extends to activated T cells. The second scenario is that TTP becomes transiently phosphorylated by one of the kinases following CD28 or LFA\u20101 engagement. The ultimate outcome is a transient immune response and controlled cytokine production.",

When cytokines such as IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2, IL\u20104, and IL\u201010 dampen the immune response, they tend to destabilize mRNAs involved. IFN such as IFN\u2010\u03b2 or \u2010\u03b3, when in combination with LPS, induces TTP transcription and thereby reduces proinflammatory cytokines, namely, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 and the chemokines CCL2 (MCP\u20101) and CCL3 (MIP\u20101\u03b1) [\n90\n].

As TTP is considered an anti\u2010inflammatory mediator and suppresses proinflammatory cytokines, it is possible that at least some of the molecules with anti\u2010inflammatory action induce TTP or its activity. Indeed, glucocorticoids can induce the transcription of TTP in the A549 lung epithelial cell line; small interfering RNA to TTP prevented dexamethasone\u2010induced reduction of TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA stability and activity of reporter fused with TNF\u2010\u03b1 3\u2032UTR [\n91\n].

In general, miRNAs are considered post\u2010transcriptional, negative regulatory elements, which have the ability to dampen many biological processes including innate and adaptive immunity. A role in the regulation of T cell development has been proposed recently in a few studies [\n96\n, \n97\n, \n98\n, \n99\n]. Specific deletion of the dicer\u2010coding gene, dcr\u20101, in mouse T cell lineage resulted in aberrant Th cell differentiation and failure to suppress IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression under Th2\u2010polarizing conditions [\n98\n]. Although no mechanism is discussed in this study, it is possible that miRNA targets the IFN\u2010\u03b3 mRNA, which harbors an ARE, which may in turn be a target for miR16 by a process in which TTP promotes mRNA decay. Involvement of miRNA in ARE\u2010mediated instability has been documented by demonstrating that dicer and miR16 are required in epithelial cells [\n100\n]. This TTP involvement would be an attractive option in explaining the IFN\u2010\u03b3 mRNA dysregulation in dicer\u2010deficient Th cells. Another important role of dicer in T cell development has been shown to occur in the development of regulatory T cells (Treg); absence of dicer leads to a reduced number of Treg and immunopathological disorders such as splenomegaly [\n97\n]. This study concludes that dicer facilitates the development of Treg in the thymus and the efficient induction of the necessary forkhead transcription factor, Foxp3, by TGF\u2010\u03b2 in naive CD4 T cells [\n97\n]. Several miRNAs, miR146a/b, miR132, and miR155, are LPS\u2010responsive genes in human monocytes [\n99\n, \n101\n]. The miR155 is inducible in a human primary macrophage in response to different types of inflammatory mediators [\n101\n], but its effects on the immune cell function remain to be elucidated. The miR146a/b bind sequences in the 3\u2032UTRs of two important adaptor molecules involved in LPS signaling, TRAF6 and IRAK1, and these UTRs inhibit expression of reporter constructs [\n99\n].",
