This is achieved through recognition of microbial PAMPs by 1 or more of a variety of cellular receptors (pattern recognition receptors [PRRs]) for these PAMPs displayed by CD45\u2212 stromal cells, such as respiratory epithelial cells, as well as CD45+ cells, within the lung.1, 2, 3 Recent studies also emphasize the importance of host immune cell recognition of damage-associated danger signals (damage-associated molecular patterns [DAMPs]) typically composed of sequestered self-constituents released from infected cells, damaged cells, or both.4 These PAMP and DAMP molecular \u201cred flags\u201d can also activate the intracellular innate protein complex, the inflammasome, which also can play a key role in orchestrating both the innate and adaptive immune responses to viruses.5, 6 In addition, the role of complement in controlling early viral replication and in the initiation of innate and adaptive immunity is being increasingly appreciated. Thus an emerging view from recent investigations is that that the recognition and subsequent eradication of invading viral pathogens at mucosal sites, such as the airways, requires the concerted action of PRRs, as well as immune sensors of cellular stress/damage arising from viral infection.",

            "text": "RIG-I is the prototypical member of the RLR family of cytosolic PRRs that recognize nucleotide motifs displayed by RNA viruses (Fig 1). Its primary function is to activate interferon genes through the adaptor mitochondrial anti-viral signaling (MAVS), which in turn engages the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3/7 transcription factor signaling pathway.9 RIG-I signaling is also important for activation of the inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 production (see below). Infection of cells by vesicular stomatitis virus or transfection of cells by RNA activates the RIG-I pathway and leads to pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 production through a MAVS\u2013CARD9\u2013nuclear factor \u03baB signaling pathway. In parallel, RIG-I can also directly activate the inflammasome complex by binding the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) (see below).10, 11 Recently, the interferon-inducible protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) has been identified as a novel sensor for cytosolic DNA, such as DNA virus genomes, through an HIN-200 DNA-binding domain.12 AIM2 can activate caspase-1 and the inflammasome in addition to inducing type I interferons.13 (Other potential cytosolic DNA recognition molecules, such as cyclic-GMP-AMP [cGAMP] synthase [cGAS] and DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors [DAI], have also been implicated as sensors triggering type I interferon responses.) Although RIG-I and AIM2 detect viral PAMPs in the cytosol, TLRs sense these PAMPs within endosomes (eg, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9) or on the cell surface (eg, TLR2 and TLR4; Fig 1).",

Despite the distinct receptor complexes used by type I (ie, IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2) and type III interferons, they trigger similar intracellular signaling pathways in a wide variety of target cells, resulting in many of the same biological activities, including antiviral activity. Intriguingly, unlike type I interferon receptors, which are widely expressed on many cell types, including leukocytes, the receptors for IFN-\u03bbs are largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin. Therefore the IFN-\u03bb ligands and their IFN-\u03bb receptors represent a potential novel antiviral therapeutic target.",

These damage-associated signals produced as a result of viral replication are, along with viral PAMPs, believed to play a crucial role in activating the inflammasome and controlling the magnitude and quality of the subsequent innate and adaptive immune response to viral infection (Fig 2\n).4, 5, 6 Damage-associated signals are molecules, such as nucleotides (ie, ATP/uridine triphosphate), heat shock proteins, nuclear proteins (ie, high-mobility group box 1 [HMGB1]), mitochondrial DNA, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species, that leak from or are actively released from intracellular compartments after cellular stress or damage. In addition, extracellular molecules, such as extracellular ATP, extracellular matrix components, and uric acids, can also serve as damage-associated signals. These released molecules are then recognized by sensors expressed by surrounding cells, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), involved in the initiation of the innate and adaptive immune response (Fig 2). The signals transduced in responding cells by these released self-constituents result in the activation of the cellular protease caspase-1, which in turn catalyzes the maturation and release of active IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Caspase-1 activation is dependent on the assembly of an intracellular inflammasome sensor complex, which is made up of Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like domain containing a caspase-recruitment domain,21 and procaspase-1.5, 6\n",

Mice deficient in inflammasome complex\u2013associated molecules, such as NLPR3, IL-1 receptor, caspase-1, or ASC, are more susceptible to severe IAV infection than control infected animals with an intact inflammasome complex, as evidenced by increased viral titers, reduced infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes to the infected lung, impaired adaptive immune responses, and reduced cytokine/chemokine levels (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, and keratinocyte-derived cytokine).24, 25, 30 More recent evidence further suggests that IL-1 receptor\u2013deficient mice exhibit a reduction in the extent of migration of lung DCs, in particular CD103+ lung DCs, to the draining lymph nodes in response to IAV infection.20 This diminished DC migration was associated with a reduction in the total accumulation of inflammatory/immune cells into the draining lymph nodes and the subsequent impairment of the antiviral CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell response in the infected lungs, which is consistent with the critical role of migrant CD103+ lung DCs in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to viral respiratory tract infection. Although reports differ in the extent to which inflammasome impairment affects the host response to viral respiratory tract infection, overall, the accumulating data strongly suggest that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and ensuing IL-1\u2013dependent, IL-1 receptor\u2013mediated signaling are critical for the establishment of antiviral innate and adaptive immune defenses, as well as resolution and repair of tissue damage, at least for experimental IAV infection.",

            "text": "It is increasingly clear that signaling through receptors sensing cellular damage produced by viral infection also plays an important role in activating the innate immune response. As noted above, this occurs, at least in part, through inflammasome activation. Accordingly, intracellular molecules (ie, ATP and HMGB1) serving as DAMPs are released from the infected cells, most often as a consequence of infection-induced apoptosis, necrosis, or pyroptosis,31 and accumulate in the extracellular space at a high concentration during viral infection, where these DAMPs can modulate antiviral immunity.32, 33, 34 For example, during adenovirus infection in the lungs, ATP-mediated signaling through the purinergic receptor P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) appears to be required for inflammasome-dependent induction of inflammatory mediators because inhibition or deficiency of P2X7R (or the inflammasome-dependent pro\u2013IL-1\u2013activating protease caspase-1) significantly reduced IL-1\u03b2 secretion and neutrophil infiltration.35 Similarly, P2Y2R purinergic receptor\u2013deficient mice exhibit increased morbidity and mortality with diminished viral clearance and increased neutrophil infiltration in the lung after pneumonia virus of mice infection.36 However, recognition of products of cellular damage need not always result in an enhanced innate host response and accelerated viral clearance. For example, recognition of HMGB1 through the DAMP receptor known as receptor for advanced glycation end-products reduces the host resistance to IAV infection.37 Although the contribution of the inflammasome pathway during viral respiratory tract infection has not been fully explored, the observations to date suggest that an array of damage-associated signals released during viral infection modulates, to varying degrees (ie, in a pathogen-dependent manner), the host antiviral immune response and thereby susceptibility to acute viral respiratory tract infection.",

However, the caspase-1 inhibitory effect of NS1 might be IAV strain specific because NS1 from highly pathogenic avian H5N1 activates caspases and induces apoptosis.39 Thus highly pathogenic IAV virus strains, such as H5N1, might not need to use caspase-1 inhibition as a strategy to suppress inflammasome activation\u2013associated inflammation because these viruses might directly downregulate expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components on infection.40\n",

Complement deficiency (ie, in components C3, C3a, and C5a) in mice causes markedly reduced T-cell responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus43, 44 and IAV infection,45, 46 resulting in a reduced survival rate. In a recent study complement deficiency had no effect on the ability of DCs to trigger T-cell responses after influenza infection but instead resulted in diminished lung DC migration and accumulation into the lung draining lymph nodes (mediastinal lymph node [MLN]),46 suggesting a potential mechanism for the aforementioned impaired anti-IAV T-cell response in infected lungs. In this connection it is noteworthy that the CD103+ lung DC subset, which plays a prominent role in the induction of the adaptive immune T-cell response to viral respiratory tract infection in the MLNs, is now recognized to have the unique capacity to both sense and produce complement, thereby controlling both its own migration and the migration of CD11b+ respiratory DCs from the infected lung into the MLNs. Intriguingly, emerging evidence suggests that certain complement components (eg, C1q) can also either negatively or positively regulate inflammasome activation, depending on the disease.47, 48 Thus components of the complement pathway might, like viral PAMPs and cellular DAMPs, provide additional immunologic cues to regulate host immunity to viral infection.",

            "text": "In viral respiratory tract infections cellular immune (ie, T-cell) responses can also play an important role in viral clearance from the lungs. In immunocompetent infants infected with RSV, viral clearance is typically achieved within 3 weeks of the onset of infection. However, RSV virus can persist for several months or more in infants with defective cellular immunity.55, 56, 57, 58 As noted above, respiratory DCs play an important role as initiators of the antiviral T-cell response. In the mouse model of IAV infection, langerin+CD103+CD11b\u2212 DCs within the conducting and terminal airways have been demonstrated to take up viral antigens and subsequently migrate from the site of infection into the MLNs. Here they act as APCs to trigger the activation of viral antigen\u2013specific native T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells).59 CD103\u2212CD11b+Ly6C+ inflammatory DCs also infiltrate into IAV-infected conducting airways and lung parenchyma. Within hours of the onset of infection, these DCs also migrate into the MLNs carrying viral antigens.60, 61, 62 Although lymph node\u2013resident CD8\u03b1+ DCs are also capable of stimulating CD8+ T cells by cross-presenting viral antigens after uptake, they are less efficient than migrant CD103+ respiratory DCs as APCs for CD8+ T cells and cannot induce CD4+ T-cell responses.60, 63\nEx vivo sorted CD103+CD11b\u2212 DCs derived from MLNs of IAV-infected mice are the most potent at inducing CD8+ T-cell responses.64 Moreover, in vivo depletion of CD103+CD11b\u2212 DCs before IAV infection by diphtheria toxin administration into mice expressing diphtheria toxin receptor selectively in lung CD103+CD11b\u2212 DCs resulted in a diminished antiviral CD8+ T-cell response and delayed viral clearance from the infected lungs.59 These results and comparable findings in other models of viral infection suggested that among the DC subsets present in the MLNs, the migrant langerin+CD103+CD11b\u2212 respiratory DCs are the most potent APCs for the activation of naive antiviral T cells after viral lung infection.65, 66\n",

However, this interaction might not always be beneficial because onsite restimulation of antiviral CD8+ effector T cells by CD11c+ DCs elicits not only the cytotoxic response, which is crucial for viral clearance, but also proinflammatory cytokine production, including IFN-\u03b3, directly by the responding T cells (or indirectly through cytokines produced by infiltrating innate immune effectors cells). The excess production of proinflammatory cytokines can lead to enhanced inflammation and injury, resulting in immunopathology during pulmonary viral infection.70\n",

On migration to MLNs, LAPCs promote the differentiation of viral antigen\u2013primed CD4+ T cells into TFH cells through inducible costimulator/inducible costimulator ligand\u2013mediated stimulation.54 In ex vivo coculture experiments neither B cells nor DCs isolated from the MLNs of IAV-infected mice efficiently induce TFH differentiation by antigen-primed CD4+ T cells. Therefore because of the late migration of LAPCs from the infected respiratory tract to the site of CD4+ T-cell activation and differentiation, LAPCs might be uniquely positioned to monitor the extent of microbial replication in the respiratory tract after the initial induction of T-cell responses by DCs in the MLNs and thereby regulate the balance between tissue-migrating TH1-type effector T cells and the MLN-resident antibody-supporting TFH differentiation.",

In the mouse model of RSV infection, both plasmacytoid DCs and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages have been suggested to play a crucial role in restricting excessive T cell\u2013mediated inflammation through an unknown mechanism.95, 96 Adaptive immune cells also play a role in tissue homeostasis: forkhead box protein 3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells97 have an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing inflammation in naive hosts. After viral respiratory tract infection, Treg cells in the lungs have been shown to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 through a BLIMP1 (transcription regulator B lymphocyte\u2013induced maturation protein 1, also known as PRDM1)\u2013dependent mechanism and control excessive immune responses.98, 99, 100 In the mouse model of RSV infection, the depletion of Treg cells leads to excessive pulmonary inflammation and lung injury during the course of infection.97, 101, 102 Recently, not only Treg cells but also conventional effector T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) have been shown to exert a \u201cregulatory\u201d function in the lung through the production of IL-10 during simian virus 5, IAV, or RSV infection.100, 103, 104 The in vivo blockade of T cell\u2013derived IL-10 results in excessive pulmonary inflammation characterized by increased accumulation of CD45+ inflammatory cells and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines, especially during the course of IAV or RSV infection.100, 104, 105 These findings reinforce the view that there are multiple layers of immunoregulation at both the cellular and molecular levels, which play an essential role in maintaining lung tissue homeostasis and preventing excess inflammation during the resolution phase of viral respiratory tract infections.",

Interferon (types I and III) production in response to viral respiratory tract infection can be triggered by recognition of (1) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the cytosolic receptors melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or (2) dsDNA (B-DNA) by DAI or as yet unknown cytosolic DNA receptors (DNA-RX; not depicted). This recognition leads to the activation of interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)-3 through the kinase TANK-binding kinase (TBK)-1 (or IKKi) and stimulates the production of interferons (types I and III) at the site of infection. RIG-I is also triggered by 5\u2032-pppRNA transcribed from dsDNA by using RNA polymerase III. In addition, ligation of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 by respective viral molecules triggers type I interferon production by means of signaling through adaptor molecules, including MyD88, Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF). The association of these adaptors with TBK1 ultimately results in the activation of the IRF family members (ie, IRF3/5/7) and, in some instances, nuclear factor \u03baB, leading to the transcription of interferon genes (types I and III) and proinflammatory cytokines, such as pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2, pro\u2013IL-18, and IL-6. Of note, the production of interferons (types I and III) can be amplified by a positive feedback loop in which the interferons produced early trigger transcription in both autocrine and paracrine fashions.",

Respiratory tract viruses can trigger both signal 1 and signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Sensing of viral pathogen\u2013associated pattern molecules induces the transcription of pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2/pro\u2013IL-18 and NLRP3 along with additional proinflammatory cytokines. The purinergic receptors, such as P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel that causes potassium (K+) efflux when activated, are partially required for M2-induced inflammasome activation. In the case of influenza virus infection, virus-encoded M2 ion channel protein transports protons (H+) out of the lumen and triggers M2-mediated inflammasome activation. Phagolysosomal maturation and the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cathepsin B also play a role in virus-induced inflammasome activation, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. The activation of the inflammasome in DCs and macrophages leads to the activation of caspase-1, which mediates the processing of pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2/pro\u2013IL-18 to mature IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 and its subsequent release into the extracellular space.
