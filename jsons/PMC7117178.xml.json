In the IBV genome, similar to other CoVs, two-thirds of the 5\u2032 region encodes the 1a and 1ab polyproteins, which are proteolytically cleaved by two virus-encoded replicase proteins (the papain-like and 3C-like proteinases) into at least 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u2013nsp16) (Ziebuhr et al., 2001). In the remaining one-third of the genome, most coronaviruses, including IBV, code four major structural proteins; the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. It is generally believed that the S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding activity of the S protein, carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants, and is a determinant of cell tropism. Interspersed among the structural protein genes are two small accessory protein genes (genes 3 and 5) that vary in number and sequences among the IBVs. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) usually harbor important structural elements, which are involved in replication and/or translation (Masters, 2006).",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, the nsp 13 of the ck/CH/LZJ/111113 strain bears a much greater nucleotide sequence identity to that of ck/CH/LDL/091022 (96.3%) than to 4/91, though the ck/CH/LZJ/111113 1\u20131453 in the S1 gene showed an identical sequence to that of 4/91. It worth noting that in agreement to the nsp 13, strain ck/CH/LZJ/111113 1453\u20133492 in spike, M and 1\u20131015 in the N genes shared 99.3, 99.0 and 94.9% identities to those of ck/CH/LDL/091022, respectively, in contrast to the 84.8, 91.3 and 86.9% to 4/91. To our surprise, ck/CH/LZJ/111113 from 1032 to the end of the N gene and 3\u2032 UTR again have identical sequences to those of 4/91 and were different from those of ck/CH/LDL/091022 (91.3 and 75.2%, respectively). In addition, ck/CH/LZJ/111113 and ck/CH/LDL/091022 had a 96% nucleotide identity; however, this figure was up to 97.2% when the 4/91-like sequences in the 5\u2032 ends of S1 and N were excluded. These data strongly suggested that ck/CH/LZJ/111113 arose from a homologous RNA recombinant event from multiple template switches (at least three switches) between 4/91- and ck/CH/LDL/091022-like viruses. Here, we investigated the presence of two switch sites at the 3\u2032 ends of the S1 and N genes, respectively (Fig. 2), implying that template switches occurred within the S1 and N genes. Due to the unavailability of the sequences between nsp 13 and the spike genes in the 4/91 virus, we could not identify the exact switch site before the spike gene; however, by comparing the sequence with that of ck/CH/LDL/091022, we could predict that this site may tend to lie immediately upstream of the S glycoprotein gene because ck/CH/LZJ/111113 and ck/CH/LDL/091022 shared highly identical sequences in this region.",

This has been well documented in IBV, which was clearly shown to be responsible for the emergence of several new serotypes or variants (Jackwood et al., 2010), and contributed to the outbreaks of diseases in chickens. The recombination events from which the ck/CH/LZJ/111113 virus resulted can be explained by two models. In the most simple scenario, the recombination may have involved only two parental viral strains with RNA replication initiating in a ck/CH/LDL/091022-like template of either negative or positive polarity and then switching of the polymerase\u2013nascent cRNA complex to a 4/91-like virus template, followed by double switches at the 3\u2032 ends of the S1 and N genes, respectively. The first switch may have occurred in the vicinity of the ORF 1/S boundary, presumptively upstream of the spike glycoprotein gene, but the exact site for this is currently unknown because of the sequence of 4/91 at this position is unavailable. In this scenario, the ck/CH/LDL/091022- and 4/91-like viruses must be both circulating in the animal breeding facilities for long periods, in which chickens were infected simultaneously and recombination events occurred. Alternatively, a more complicated scheme can be envisaged. In this scheme, a ck/CH/LDL/091022-4/91 hybrid arose from a single switch at either of the three or from two switches at two sites and spread among the chicken flocks and in turn engaged in additional recombination events with another 4/91-like virus. IBV circulates extensively in chicken flocks, either broiler or layer hens, and even in the vaccinated flocks in many countries, in some cases, with more than one type of strain. Conceivably, this and the long persistence of IBV in chickens could raise the odds of occurrences of double or triple infections.",

This is true in the case of ck/CH/LZJ/111113. China has an extremely large number of chickens and most of the chickens in different districts in China are maintained at a high density. LX4-type IBV isolates are found to be the predominant IBV type circulating in both laying hens and broilers in China. Though only small numbers of 4/91-like viruses have been isolated in chicken flocks in China (Han et al., 2011), however, 4/91 live vaccine are commonly used during the breeding period, the vaccines must certainly be implicated as a source for 4/91-like sequences. The LX4- or 4/91-like sources of genetic material were probably a strain that naturally infects these affected flocks, as found in ck/CH/LZJ/111113 in this study. The natural recombination event demonstrated here could suggest that the continuous use of live vaccines may actually contribute to natural recombination and IBV-associated disease.",

However, a recombination event itself is unlikely to be the only reason directly responsible for these distinctions between ck/CH/LZJ/111113 and ck/CH/LDL/091022 because only a few mutations were found in other parts of the genomes. Because the S glycoprotein gene is involved in host cell attachment and contains viral neutralizing epitopes, recombination of the S glycoprotein gene can result in the emergence of new strains or serotypes of the virus as well as new viruses with distinct characteristics such as pathogenicity and tissue tropism. This may likely to be the actual reason for the change in serotype and tissue tropism for the ck/CH/LZJ/111113 strain compared to ck/CH/LDL/091022.",

Perhaps the acquisition of the 3\u2032 end of the N gene and the 3\u2032 UTR from 4/91 by ck/CH/LZJ/111113 can alter the viral replication efficiency, as observed in this study.
