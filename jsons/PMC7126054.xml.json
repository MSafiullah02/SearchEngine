            "text": "Baculoviruses are a diverse group of DNA viruses capable of infecting more than 600 insects, among which Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the best characterized and most extensively employed, thus baculovirus discussed in this article refers to AcMNPV unless otherwise noted. AcMNPV contains a circular dsDNA genome of \u2248 134 kb and replicates in a bi-phasic fashion. The viral proteins polyhedrin and p10 are expressed abundantly in infected cells and are dispensable for virus replication, thus recombinant baculovirus can be constructed by placing the foreign gene under the control of polyhedrin or p10 promoter, and used to infect insect cells for foreign gene expression. Such baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system has been exhaustively utilized for the production of numerous recombinant proteins (Kost and Condreay, 1999) and commercial vaccine products such as Cervarix\u00ae and Provenge\u00ae (Hitchman et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2011).",

            "text": "In addition to insect cells, baculovirus is able to transduce animal cells of human, rodent, rabbit, porcine, bovine, fish and avian origins (Hu, 2005, Hu, 2006) as well as relatively primitive cells including embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells (Table 1\n) and induced pluripotent stem cells (Fig. 1\n). Within the baculovirus-transduced cells, the transgene can be expressed as long as it is driven by an appropriate promoter (e.g. cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) or hybrid CAG promoter consisting of the CMV early enhancer and chicken \u03b2-actin promoter). Baculovirus cloning capacity is as large as 38 kb (Cheshenko et al., 2001), thus allowing for the insertion of multiple genes and regulatory elements (Kost et al., 2005, Kost and Condreay, 2002). Baculovirus neither replicates inside the transduced cells nor integrates its DNA into host chromosomes in the absence of selective pressure (Chen et al., 2011a, Merrihew et al., 2001), hence easing the safety concerns. Humans do not possess pre-existing antibody and T-cells specifically against baculovirus (Strauss et al., 2007), therefore baculovirus may circumvent the pre-existing immunity problem faced by other viral vectors. Finally, recombinant baculovirus can be readily constructed and propagated to high titers in biosafety level 1 facilities by infecting its natural host insect cells (Hu, 2008). These attributes have fueled growing interests to explore baculovirus for a wide variety of applications, ranging from protein production (Jardin et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2010), virus production (Huang et al., 2007, Lesch et al., 2008, Lesch et al., 2011, Lucifora et al., 2008, McCormick et al., 2002, Nakowitsch et al., 2006, Zheng et al., 2010), virus-like particle production (Chen et al., 2005, Matsuo et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2005), eucaryotic protein display (Ernst et al., 2006, Grabherr and Ernst, 2010), vaccine development (Hu et al., 2008, Madhan et al., 2010, Tani et al., 2008), cancer therapy (Wang and Balasundaram, 2010), cell-based assay development (Condreay et al., 2006, Condreay and Kost, 2007, Kost et al., 2010) to tissue engineering (Lin et al., 2010b).",

It was also proposed that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Long et al., 2006, Matilainen et al., 2005) and macropinocytosis (Matilainen et al., 2005) play roles in baculovirus entry. Contradictorily, a recent study (Laakkonen et al., 2009) discovered that (1) baculovirus entered HEK293 and HepG2 cells along fluid-phase markers from the raft areas into vesicles devoid of clathrin; (2) macropinocytosis-related regulators (e.g. EIPA, Pak1, Rab34 and Rac1) imparted no significant effects on virus transduction and (3) the internalization and nuclear uptake were affected by the regulators of clathrin-independent entry. These data unveiled a baculovirus entry pathway independent of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and suggested that phagocytosis might play a role (Laakkonen et al., 2009), which echoed the observations reported previously (Abe et al., 2005). Moreover, other recent studies reported that baculovirus transduction related to direct fusion pathway induced by a short pH trigger (Dong et al., 2010, Paul and Prakash, 2010). These conflicting data underlined the need for more in-depth studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism and might suggest that baculovirus entry pathway varies with cell types. Nevertheless, one consensus is that baculovirus envelope protein gp64 is pivotal for entry because blocking gp64 can abrogate the baculovirus ability to transduce mammalian cells (Abe et al., 2005, Niu et al., 2008) and activate dendritic cells (DCs) (Schutz et al., 2006).",

Among the baculoviral genes, ie1 is expressed early in insect cells and transactivates downstream gene expression. Forced expression of ie1 by the minimal CMV promoter in Vero E6 cells also markedly activates gp64 and pe38, and upregulates ie2, he65, pcna, orf16, orf17 and orf25 (Liu et al., 2007). The critical role of ie1 for transactivating downstream genes was further unraveled in a recent study (Efrose et al., 2010), which showed that baculovirus deficient in ie1 gene mitigates residual baculoviral gene expression 10- to 100-fold (when compared with wild-type baculovirus) in transduced mammalian cells, thus enhancing safety features to baculovirus-based gene therapy.",

Strikingly, IE2 is a strong transactivator of CMV promoter in both Vero E6 and U-2OS cells (Liu et al., 2009a). When overexpressed within the baculovirus context, IE2 forms the nuclear foci and develops into large nuclear bodies (NBs) with a hollow center. The IE2 NBs structure contains abundant G-actin, closely associates with RNA polymerase II, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO1) and is the site of active transcription, thereby contributing to the IE2-associated gene stimulation (Liu et al., 2009a). Furthermore, the NBs formation and CMV promoter activation require the N-terminal RING finger and C-terminal coiled-coil domains of IE2 (Liu et al., 2009a). Since CMV promoter is exhaustively used for baculovirus-mediated gene transfer, the transactivating activity of IE2 may be useful for baculovirus-mediated protein production in mammalian cells (Liu et al., 2010).",

Not only the cytokine secretion, in vitro baculovirus transduction also activates human (Schutz et al., 2006) and mouse (Abe et al., 2005) DCs. Moreover, wild-type baculovirus transduction of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) upregulates the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II and co-stimulation molecules (e.g. CD40, CD80 and CD86) (Suzuki et al., 2010a). The activated BMDCs can further stimulate natural killer (NK) cells upon co-culture, as evidenced by the IFN-\u03b3 production, CD69 upregulation and cell proliferation.",

Upon wild-type baculovirus transduction, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) secret IL-6 and IL-8, but no detectable levels of IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-12 (Chen et al., 2009b). Human leukocyte antigen I (HLA-I) is slightly upregulated, but the expression of HLA-II and other surface markers are barely disturbed (Bak et al., 2010, Chuang et al., 2009). Neither does baculovirus transduction compromise the immunosuppressive properties of BMSCs (Chuang et al., 2009). Conversely, wild-type baculovirus transduction of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) elicits only the chemokine IP-10, but not other well-known cytokines (unpublished data). BMSCs and iPSCs are promising cell sources for regenerative medicine. The lack of these cytokine responses reduces the risk of mounting strong immune responses after transplantation of baculovirus-transduced BMSCs and iPSCs.",

For instance, TLR3 recognizes virus-derived dsRNA while TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs. Upon engagement with cognate ligands, TLRs are activated and recruit adaptor molecules such as myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) to transduce signals to downstream molecules. Besides, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cytoplasmic sensor that activates IRF3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to viral dsDNA while retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are TLR-independent cytoplasmic RNA detectors that induce the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production through IFN promoter-stimulator-1 (IPS-1).",

The detection activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and leads to subsequent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production. However, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are still produced in peritoneal cells derived from MyD88- or TLR9-deficient mice (Abe et al., 2005). In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), baculovirus triggers IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-inducible chemokines through TLR-independent and IRF3-dependent pathways and endosomal maturation is required for induction (Abe et al., 2009). These data suggest that baculovirus DNA might be recognized by at least two different pathways: TLR9-dependent endosomal recognition and TLR9-independent cytoplasmic recognition. The latter was suggested to be related to STING (Abe and Matsuura, 2010) because baculovirus-induced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production was impaired in STING-deficient MEFs (Ishikawa et al., 2009), yet IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulation was found to be independent of other cytoplasmic RNA detectors such as RIG-I and MDA5 (Abe et al., 2009). However, a recent study noted that RIG-I and MDA5 mRNA levels were elevated in baculovirus-transduced cells (Wang et al., 2010). Addition of DNA methytransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) prior to transduction retarded such upregulation and enhanced baculovirus-mediated gene expression, suggesting that DNMTi may somehow facilitate the baculovirus evasion from the cellular recognition and thus ameliorate the transgene expression.",

The same study also identified 532 gene probes (1.99%) in human astrocytes and 1219 gene probes (4.32%) in human neuronal cells that were disturbed in response to baculovirus. Despite the disparity between cell types, in all 3 samples baculovirus altered the expression of genes associated with TLR signaling pathway (e.g. TLR2, TLR3, CCL5, CXCL10 and STAT1) and cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction (e.g. CXCL10, CXCL11 and CCL5). Moreover, genes associated with interferon induction-related genes (e.g. CXCL10, MX1, MX2, OAS1 and STAT1) and antigen processing and presentation pathway (e.g. CD74 and RT-1Ba) were affected. As such, Wang and coworkers proposed that baculovirus recognition by TLRs triggers the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, which initiates the subsequent signaling cascade involving STATs, upregulating the expression of IFN-responsive genes and hence confers the cells the antiviral state. Concurrent with the aforementioned findings, we also discovered that baculovirus transduction of human BMSCs disturbed the expression of 816 genes, most of which were related to 5 signaling pathways: cell adhesion molecules, TLR, Jak-STAT, apoptosis as well as antigen processing and presentation (Chen et al., 2009b). Of note, baculovirus triggered the TLR3 pathway, resulting in downstream NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 activation and IL-6/IL-8 production. However, how baculovirus containing the dsDNA genome activated the dsRNA sensor TLR3 remains an enigma. Also, the transduction did not arouse the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 (Chen et al., 2009b), a signature cytokine associated with TLR3 activation, implying a signaling cascade somewhat distinct from that in immune cells.",

ApNPV transduction of HD11 cells concomitantly induces the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p40 and nitric oxide (NO) (Niu et al., 2008), which is accompanied by the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as activation of p65-NF-\u03baB (Han et al., 2009). Inhibition of p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB by their respective inhibitors abrogates the expression of cytokines and NO, whereas inhibition of JNK abolishes only the induction of cytokines. Since in mammals TLRs signaling activates the downstream NF-\u03baB and MAPK cascade comprised of at least p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2, and JNK (Ishii et al., 2008), these data altogether suggest that ApNPV transduction of HD11 cells activates TLR21 and signals though NF-\u03baB, p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, and chicken TLR21 might play a role similar to mammalian TLR9 (Han et al., 2009, Han et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Baculovirus envelope protein gp64 comprises an N-terminal signal peptide and a mature domain that encompasses the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain (CTD). Heterologous protein/peptide has been inserted in between the signal peptide and mature domain, which after expression under the polyhedrin or p10 promoter as a fusion protein is translocated to the plasma membrane and incorporated into the viral envelope upon virus budding. Such feature has been exploited for surface display of protein/peptide to improve the virus transduction (Grabherr and Ernst, 2010, Grabherr et al., 2001, Raty et al., 2004) or for ligand-directed targeting if an appropriate ligand is chosen (Kitagawa et al., 2005, Makela et al., 2006, Makela et al., 2008). For instance, baculovirus poorly transduces B lymphocytes (Cheng et al., 2004, Condreay et al., 1999). Via gp64 fusion, the transduction has been enhanced by displaying the short peptide motif from gp350/220 of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV, which naturally infects B cells) on the baculovirus envelope (Ge et al., 2007). Alternatively, the cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) has been fused to gp64 to enhance the baculovirus transduction of Vero E6, U-2OS and CHO-RD cells (Chen et al., 2011b). Another paradigm is the display of the fragment crystallisable (Fc) region of antibody on the baculovirus surface (Martyn et al., 2009). Fc receptors (FcRs) are membrane proteins that bind to the Fc region of antibody and mediate the phagocytosis and antigen presentation. The Fc display allows for specific baculovirus targeting to cell lines and antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing FcRs, hence augmenting the vaccine effect (Martyn et al., 2009). The display system also allows for the surface presentation of functional membrane proteins to simplify subsequent isolation (Zhang et al., 2008).",

The inactivation problem has been circumvented by the use of complement inhibitors such as compstatin (Georgopoulos et al., 2009) and soluble complement inhibitor 1 (Hoare et al., 2005, Hofmann et al., 1999), avoiding exposure to the complement (Airenne et al., 2000) or administrating the vector to immunoprivileged sites (Kinnunen et al., 2009, Lehtolainen et al., 2002). Alternatively, the baculoviral vector can become complement-resistant by displaying human DAF (decay accelerating factor) via gp64 fusion (Huser et al., 2001, Kaname et al., 2010). More recently, baculoviral vectors displaying different complement regulatory proteins (e.g. DAF, factor H-like protein-1, C4b-binding protein and membrane cofactor protein) were generated by fusion with the membrane anchor of VSVG (Kaikkonen et al., 2010). These surface-modified vectors exhibited varying degrees of complement resistance in vitro and DAF yielded the highest level of protection. Intraportal delivery of the DAF-displaying baculovirus increased the survival and gene expression in immunocompetent mice. The DAF-displaying baculovirus provoked lower levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12p40 in macrophages and mitigated liver inflammation in mice when compared with the control virus. These results prove that DAF display offers protection to the baculoviral vector against complement inactivation and attenuates complement-mediated inflammation injury.",

Similarly, the ZnO binding peptide has been fused to the N-terminus of VP39 while retaining the viral infectivity and conferring the ability to bind nanosized ZnO powders (Song et al., 2010). Besides, by fusing the protein transduction domain (PTD) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) TAT protein (a protein responsible for nuclear import of HIV genome) with VP39, the engineered baculovirus results in improved transduction of various mammalian cells (Chen et al., 2011b).",

Since the initial demonstrations of baculovirus-mediated shRNA delivery (Nicholson et al., 2005, Ong et al., 2005), baculovirus-mediated RNAi has been explored for antiviral therapy. One baculovirus expressing the shRNA specific for the C-terminal nucleoprotein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genome inhibits the viral replication in vitro (Lu et al., 2006). The baculovirus harboring a bispecific shRNA targeted against influenza virus A and B can inhibit the production of both virus types in transduced cell lines (Suzuki et al., 2009b). Another baculovirus expressing shRNA against the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) represses PPRV replication in vitro and the inhibition effect is superior to that mediated by the adenovirus expressing the same shRNA (Nizamani et al., 2011). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA is the source of HBV transcripts in chronically infected patients. Baculovirus expressing the HBV-specific shRNA is able to hinder the formation of HBV CCC DNA (Starkey et al., 2009). Additionally, the baculovirus expressing shRNAs specific for the highly conserved core region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome dramatically impedes the target protein expression (Suzuki et al., 2009c).",

Based on this concept, Suzuki et al. devised a baculoviral vector that accommodated the oriP/EBNA1 sequence and encoded the HCV-specific shRNA.

The baculovirus vectors carried artificial gene-specific miRNA sequences within the miR155 scaffold, which after expression under the CMV promoter could undergo the miRNA processing pathway and knocked down the target gene (e.g. EGFP and TNF-\u03b1) expression (unpublished data). The gene suppression effect was extended by flanking the miRNA expression cassette with the inverted terminal repeat sequences/direct repeats sequences (IR/DR) recognized by the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase. Co-transduction of cells with the hybrid baculovirus/transposon vector and another SB transposase-expressing baculovirus resulted in the integration of miRNA expression cassette into the chromosome, giving rise to prolonged target gene suppression (unpublished data). These data altogether implicate the potential of baculovirus-based RNAi shuttle for antiviral therapy and treatment of indications necessitating prolonged gene regulation (e.g. arthritis).",

            "text": "The feasibility of baculovirus-mediated cancer therapy was first explored by Wang et al. (2006), who developed a baculoviral vector expressing the Diphtheria Toxin A and demonstrated that the baculovirus impeded the growth of cultured glioma cells and glioma xenograft in the rat brain. Since then, baculovirus has been utilized for the treatment of mouse hepatoma (Kitajima et al., 2008), murine melanoma, lung cancer and brain cancer (Kim et al., 2007). Recently, Wang and coworkers constructed another baculovirus that selectively expressed herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) in tumors for glioma suicide gene therapy (Balani et al., 2009). The HSVtk gene was driven by a truncated human high mobility group box2 (HMGB2) promoter, which allowed HSVtk expression in glioblastoma tissues but not in normal brain tissues. This vector triggered death of glioblastoma cells in the presence of ganciclovir, but did not affect the survival of human astrocytes and neurons. In a mouse xenograft model, intratumoral injection of this baculovirus at 7 days after tumor inoculation suppressed the growth of human glioblastoma and prolonged the mouse survival. However, the tumor mass was not completely eradicated after one single baculovirus injection, presumably due to the transient HSVtk expression (Balani et al., 2009). Alternatively, the HSVtk gene was driven by the GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) promoter whose activity is similar in normal and tumor cells of the same lineage (Wu et al., 2009a). To limit the transgene expression in glioma cells, repeated target sequences of 3 miRNAs (has-miR31, has-miR127 and has-miR143) that are enriched in astrocytes but are sparse in glioblastoma cells were appended to the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the HSVtk gene. The baculovirus vector markedly improved in vivo selectivity when compared with the control vector without miRNA regulation, effectively inhibited human glioma xenograft and imparted negligible toxicity to normal astrocytes. The incorporation of selected miRNA sponge thus provides an additional safety switch to prevent off-target transgene expression (Wu et al., 2009a).",

Baculovirus can also carry tumor suppressor genes such as p53 or pdcd4 (programmed cell death 4) for cancer treatment. In the mouse glioma xenograft models, the antitumor effect of the baculovirus-expressed p53 was substantiated by surface coating of the baculovirus envelope with polyethylenimine (Yang et al., 2009) or by co-administering sodium butyrate (Guo et al., 2011), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that ameliorates baculovirus-mediated gene expression (Guo et al., 2010, Hu et al., 2003, Yin et al., 2010, Zhou et al., 2010). The PDCD4-expressing baculovirus conjugated with folate-PEG efficiently expressed PDCD4 protein and induced apoptosis in human epidermal carcinoma cells (Kim et al., 2010). In a tumor xenograft, intratumoral injection of the PDCD4-expressing baculovirus significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis. Moreover, apoptin is a chicken anemia virus-derived protein that specifically triggers apoptosis in tumors. The VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing apoptin efficiently provoked apoptosis in mammalian cells, repressed the growth of xenograft tumors and prolonged the mice survival after intratumoral injection (Pan et al., 2010).",

Bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), after ex vivo transduction with wild-type baculovirus and i.v. injection into mice, significantly suppressed the lung cancer (Suzuki et al., 2010a). In a mouse melanoma model, baculovirus-transduced BMDCs inhibited tumor growth and improved animal survival at least partly due to the induction of CD8+ T cell- and NK cell-dependent, CD4+ T cell-independent antitumor immunity. Importantly, BMDCs administration did not provoke evident signs of damage to the liver or kidney, as judged from the negligible disturbance of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine levels (Suzuki et al., 2010a). Another promising cell courier is BMSCs thanks to their intrinsic tumor homing property. In this regard, BMSCs were transduced with a baculovirus expressing HSVtk and injected via tail vein into the mice pre-inoculated with human U87 glioma cells (Bak et al., 2010). After ganciclovir injection, tumor growth was significantly repressed and the life span of animals was considerably prolonged. More recently, the same group generated MSC-like cells from human embryonic stem (ES) cells which, after transduction with the baculovirus expressing HSVtk and injection into the brain, were capable of inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing mice in the presence of ganciclovir (Bak et al., 2011). These data implicated the feasibility of human ES cells-derived MSCs as a viable and attractive alternative for cancer therapy.",

            "text": "Given that chondrocytes are pivotal in the synthesis, composition modulation, structural arrangement of ECM components and hence the mechanical properties, we developed a protocol for baculovirus transduction of rat (Ho et al., 2004) and rabbit (Sung et al., 2007) chondrocytes. This protocol involves the incubation of cells with the virus at 25\u201327 \u00b0C for 4\u20138 h using Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) as the surrounding solution and confers efficiencies higher than 90% (Chen et al., 2006). The key to such high transduction efficiencies is the absence of NaHCO3 in D-PBS, which hinders the baculovirus transduction (Shen et al., 2007). Consequently, the surrounding solution has been replaced with NaHCO3-deficient DMEM medium (Lo et al., 2009). Critically, chondrocytes transduced with an EGFP-expressing baculovirus remain capable of producing cartilage-specific collagen II and GAGs, and grow into cartilaginous tissues when seeded into the porous, poly (l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold and cultivated dynamically (Chen et al., 2006). These data demonstrate that baculovirus transduction of chondrocytes does not obstruct the chondrocytes differentiation. Therefore, we further constructed 3 baculovirus vectors each expressing one growth factor (TGF-\u03b21, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)) known to stimulate chondrogenesis, and confirmed the protein expression in chondrocytes isolated from New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (Sung et al., 2007). Among the 3 baculovirus vectors, only the BMP-2-expressing baculovirus (designated Bac-CB) remarkably enhanced the aggrecan and collagen II production by partially de-differentiated passage 3 (P3) cells and restored the differentiation. The baculovirus expressing TGF-\u03b21 (designated Bac-CT) modestly augmented the chondrogenesis but was insufficient to reverse the de-differentiation status of P3 cells (Sung et al., 2007). Nonetheless, co-transduction of de-differentiated P3 chondrocytes with Bac-CB and Bac-CT synergistically modulated the re-differentiation program (Sung et al., 2009).",

After injection into the back subcutis of immunodeficient nude mice, the transduced BMSCs resulted in progressive mineralization and ectopic bone formation (Chuang et al., 2007). Implantation of the Bac-CB-engineered human BMSCs into rat calvarial defects stimulated mineralized bone matrix deposition and initiated the bone island formation at week 4, but without immunosuppression the xenogeneic cells were rejected and eradicated at week 12 (Chuang et al., 2010). To circumvent the rejection, BMSCs isolated from NZW rabbits were used for baculovirus transduction and allotransplantation. Given the important roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in angiogenesis, ossification and callus maturation, rabbit BMSCs were transduced with Bac-CV (expressing VEGF) or Bac-CB, mixed at a number ratio of 1:4, seeded into PLGA scaffolds and implanted to the critical-size (10 mm in length) femoral segmental defects of allogeneic, immunocompetent NZW rabbits, which represent a fairly rigorous bone healing scenario (Lin et al., 2010a). X-ray radiography, positron emission tomography (PET), micro computed tomography (\u03bcCT), immunohistochemical staining and biomechanical testing illustrated that the baculovirus-engineered cell/scaffold constructs not only accelerated the bone healing, but also gave rise to prominent angiogenesis and improved mechanical properties at week 8.",

However, ASCs appear to be inferior to BMSCs in osteogenic differentiation and ASCs engineered by the conventional baculovirus transiently expressing BMP-2/VEGF (S group) led to significantly poorer healing of segmental femoral bone defects than BMSCs engineered by the same vectors (Fig. 2\n). To use ASCs for repairing large, segmental bone defects, we surmised that sustained expression of factors promoting osteogenesis (BMP-2) and angiogenesis (VEGF) are necessary. As such, we employed a hybrid baculovirus system developed previously for persistent expression (Lo et al., 2009). The dual vector system constitutes two baculoviruses whereby one expresses the flippase recombination enzyme (FLP) while the other accommodates the BMP-2 or VEGF cassette flanked by the flippase recognition target (Frt) sequences. Within the mammalian cells co-transduced with the hybrid baculoviruses, FLP catalyzes the recombination of the Frt-flanking cassette, resulting in the cassette excision off the baculovirus genome, formation of episomal circle and substantially prolonged transgene expression (Lo et al., 2009). Likewise, the FLP/Frt-mediated recombination occurred efficiently in the NZW rabbit ASCs, enabling persistent transgene expression for > 28 days (Lin et al., 2011). Allotransplantation of the NZW rabbit ASCs transduced with the hybrid baculoviruses expressing BMP-2/VEGF into the critical-size femoral segmental defects accelerated the healing, improved the bone quality and angiogenesis when compared with transplanting ASCs engineered with the conventional baculoviruses (Fig. 2). Therefore, ASCs engineered by the hybrid baculovirus vector hold promise for repairing massive segmental defects (Lin et al., 2011).",

The transduction did not disrupt the BMSCs karyotype, nor did it disturb the expression of well-known proto-oncogenes (c-myc, N-ras, K-ras and H-ras) and tumor suppressor genes (p53 and p16). Furthermore, the transduced BMSCs did not induce tumor formation in nude mice.

The VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing the GP5 and M proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) under the CMV promoter elicited anti-PRRSV neutralizing antibodies and IFN-\u03b3, and conferred better immunogenicity than the DNA vaccine expressing the same antigens (Wang et al., 2007). Conversely, i.m. immunizations of a mixture of VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing pseudorabies virus (PRV) proteins triggered Th1-biased immune responses, as manifested by the induction of IFN-\u03b3 and PRV-specific IgG2a antibodies (Grabowska et al., 2009). The immunization also provoked NK cell activity (accompanied by the production of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) and protected mice against lethal PRV challenge. I.m. immunization of chickens with another VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus expressing HA of H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) also evoked significantly higher levels of H5-specific antibody and cellular immunity than those receiving DNA vaccines, and conferred protection against lethal challenge with the homologous virus strain (Wu et al., 2009b). Similar VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus vectors have been constructed to express the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) envelope protein (Li et al., 2009b), the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (Fan et al., 2008), and the Toxoplasma gondii SAG1 protein (Fang et al., 2010). All these studies showed that i.m. immunization of the VSVG-pseudotyped baculovirus vector results in stronger vaccine effects than the DNA vaccine counterparts, which can be attributable to the adjuvant properties of baculovirus and more efficient transduction of muscle cells in vivo. The effective transduction of muscle cells is desired as the chance of antigen presentation to DCs is increased and baculovirus-mediated expression is considerably prolonged in myogenic cells (Shen et al., 2008). Note, however, that VSVG pseudotyping induces cytotoxicity and impairs the baculovirus titer, hence a truncated version of VSVG comprised of the 21 amino acid ectodomain, the transmembrane and CTD domains was designed for baculovirus pseudotyping (Kaikkonen et al., 2006). The truncated VSVG reduced the cytotoxicity and was exploited to construct two pseudotyped baculoviruses: one expressing the capsid protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and the other encoding the capsid and a T-cell immunogen (Cao et al., 2011). I.m. inoculation of the baculoviruses into mice induced the FMDV-specific neutralizing antibodies and IFN-\u03b3, and expression of the additional T-cell immunogen augmented the immunogenicity.",

After i.m. injection and 2 booster injections at 2-week intervals, the mice developed similarly high levels of IgG, IgA and neutralization titers, as well as tremendously higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 when compared with the mice immunized with the commercial virus-like particle vaccine Gardasil\u00ae (25 \u03bcL/dose).

In comparison with the HA CTD, gp64 CTD endowed more efficient HA display and stimulated stronger hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers crucial for neutralizing the live AIV (Yang et al., 2007). The profound effect of gp64 CTD on HA display was attested in a recent study which delineated that the signal peptide and CTD of gp64 could enhance the display of influenza HA on baculovirus surface, while the gp64 transmembrane domain impaired HA display (Tang et al., 2010). Based on the finding, a baculovirus simultaneously displaying 4 HAs derived from 4 subclades of H5N1 AIV was constructed. I.m. immunization of mice with this tetravalent baculovirus elicited HI titers against all 4 homologous H5N1 viruses, significantly reduced viral lung titers of challenged mice, raised high levels of IFN-\u03b3-secreting and HA-specific CD8+ T cells, and provided 100% protection against lethal challenge with homologous H5N1 viruses (Tang et al., 2010). The same design concept exploiting the gp64 CTD was also adopted to display the \u03c3C and \u03c3B proteins of avian reovirus (Lin et al., 2008), Erns envelope glycoprotein (Xu et al., 2008), E2 (Xu and Liu, 2008) or NS3 protein (Xu et al., 2009) of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and the E glycoprotein of JEV (Xu et al., 2011). These studies collectively attested that the antigen can be efficiently displayed on the baculoviral envelope and induce humoral/cellular immune responses against the lethal viral challenge.",

The strong cellular immunity provoked by Bac-HA64, which in theory favors the MHC II pathway and preferentially elicits humoral immune responses, was likely due to the potent adjuvant effects of baculovirus. Regardless, via either administration route the dual vector Bac-CHA/HA64 triggered superior or at least comparable HA-specific immune responses than the other two vaccine forms, demonstrating the advantages of the dual form for vaccine design (Chen et al., 2010).",

I.m. injection of this vector (designated BacHA) into mice elicited the antibodies with HI titers against the tested influenza virus. In Sf-9 cells, WSSV ie1 promoter was more active than CMV promoter, thereby giving rise to more efficient HA incorporation into the baculoviral envelope (He et al., 2008). The ie1 promoter also resulted in strong HA expression in the lung (after i.n. inoculation) and thymus (after i.m. inoculation) in chickens. As a result, immunization of chickens with the baculovirus bearing the ie1 promoter (BacHA) elicited higher anti-HA antibody levels than that bearing the CMV promoter (He et al., 2008). However, i.n. inoculation of BacHA stimulated low anti-HA IgG titers (Prabakaran et al., 2008). To enhance the vaccine efficacy via the i.n. route, BacHA was co-administered with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) as the adjuvant, which significantly enhanced the serum IgG, mucosal IgA and serum microneutralization titers. With the adjuvant, BacHA also triggered higher HA-specific humoral and mucosal immune responses than the inactivated H5N1 virus adjuvanted with the same dose of rCTB, and conferred complete protection against challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains (Prabakaran et al., 2008).",

Evidence accumulating in recent years has indicated that after entry, baculovirus can translocate into the nucleus through a complex cascade of steps and express baculoviral genes and the transgene. The entire process results in the recognition of baculovirus by the cells via the TLR9-dependent and -independent pathways, and disturbs the expression of a small percentage of host genes, particularly those pertaining to the innate immune responses. However, disparity does exist between reports and the exact intracellular events remain elusive. The lack of comprehensive knowledge about the events governing the virus entry, intracellular transport and cellular responses will constitute a roadblock to future applications in the clinical setting, thus entailing extensive research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",

            "text": "Although the innate immune responses stir up concerns regarding the safety of baculovirus in gene therapy, these responses represent opportunities to harness baculovirus as a vector to defend against infectious agents and tumors. Indeed, baculovirus-based vaccine has captured explosive interests over the past 3 years and in one case has entered into trials in primates (Jin et al., 2008). Thanks to the intrinsic adjuvant properties, in most studies baculovirus-based vaccines were able to trigger potent immune responses in the absence of additional adjuvants. Due to the widespread use and encouraging preclinical data in comparison with other vaccine forms (e.g. DNA vaccine, virus-like particle vaccine and whole virus vaccine), it is envisioned that baculovirus-based vaccines can progress into next phase in the near future. The capability of shRNA/miRNA delivery also confers baculovirus an edge for target gene regulation and for future applications in antiviral therapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, baculovirus transduction of neural cells (Kenoutis et al., 2006) and adult stem cells (Bak et al., 2010, Ho et al., 2006, Zeng et al., 2009) does not markedly alter the inherent properties and mitigate the differentiation capacity, warranting baculovirus a promising vector for cell therapy and tissue engineering. Recent progresses in the baculovirus vectors engineering with respect to surface modification, minimization of in vivo inactivation, transgene targeting and prolongation of expression further corroborate the potentials of baculovirus in these applications.",

New baculoviral vectors taking advantage of hybrid promoters (Gao et al., 2007, Keil et al., 2009, Lackner et al., 2008, Pan et al., 2009) and new regulatory elements (Du et al., 2010, Mahonen et al., 2007) are also being developed and evaluated for their potential applications. Additionally, the transduction conditions (Keil et al., 2009, Pan et al., 2009), supplements (Guo et al., 2010, Yin et al., 2010) and parameters (Lee et al., 2007a, Lee et al., 2007b, Shen et al., 2007, Shen et al., 2008) dictating the transduction efficiencies have been evaluated. These technological progresses undoubtedly will facilitate the production of baculoviral vectors in compliance of cGMP regulations, and advance baculovirus from a research tool to clinical applications.",

The NZW rabbit ASCs were transduced with the hybrid baculovirus vectors conferring sustained expression of BMP-2 or VEGF, mixed at a number ratio of 4:1, loaded into cylindrical PLGA scaffolds (1.5 \u00d7 106 cells/scaffold) and implanted to the critical-size segmental defects at the femora of NZW rabbits (2 constructs/defect, designated L group). The S group contained ASCs that were transduced with conventional baculoviruses transiently expressing BMP-2/VEGF and implanted in a similar fashion. The Mock group comprised the mock-transduced ASCs as the negative control. X-ray radiography, gross appearance examination, micro computed tomography (\u03bcCT), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and CD 31-specific immunohistochemical staining (to detect blood vessel formation) performed at 12 weeks post-implantation collectively demonstrated that the L group (persistently expressing BMP-2 and VEGF) resulted in significantly improved bone healing and angiogenesis in comparison with the S group (transiently expressing BMP-2 and VEGF) and Mock group. Stars indicate the new bone while arrows indicate the blood vessel formation.",
