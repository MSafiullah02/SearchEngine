Humans generate particles by the different respiratory activities (talking, breathing, sneezing, and coughing) [3] and through emissions from the skin, hair, and clothes etc. [4]. It is well established that one of the main contributors to cross-contamination between occupants in indoor environments are high momentum respiratory activities as sneezing or coughing [5], [6], [7] which will be studied in the current work. In fact, the intense upper respiratory activities generate a higher number of particles than the normal breathing [8]. Furthermore, pathogens delivered by strong expiratory jets could be transmitted for large distances up to 3 m in the horizontal direction for high outlet velocities [9], [10] increasing the inter-personal exposure (IPE) between occupants.",

For simplification, some researches modeled coughing as steady state using computational fluids dynamics (CFD) [10] or simplified modeling [11] to understand the physics affecting disease transmission resulting from coughing. However, steady-state simulations might not reflect the complete physics affecting particle distribution resulting from transient respiratory activities (TRA). For instance, Rim and Novoselac [12] studied particle distribution caused by short term and continuous particle generation for different ventilation configurations. They found that for ventilation governed by buoyant flows, disease transmission resulting from a short-term source release differs from continuous source emission. Furthermore, the exposure is higher under continuous generation than under particle release for a limited period of time. Hence, contaminant exposure due to short-term indoor emissions differs from exposure estimated using steady-state source. From their observations, Rim and Novoselac [12] concluded that caution should be taken when making conclusions and recommendations about the risk of infection from short term sources emissions using steady-state simulations. Since high momentum respiratory activities (HMRA) as coughing and sneezing are transient, assessing the actual IPE from these activities requires transient modeling. Steady state simulations over-predict the IPE which might lead to over-designed ventilation flow rates to maintain acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) [12].",

            "text": "Transient modeling not only allows assessing accurately the risk of infection but also can reveal the effect on IPE of transient parameters (e.g. period of injection, time) that cannot be captured by steady state modeling. For instance, Xiaoping et al. [13] observed that particle concentration variation with time can be divided into two main stages: a first stage dominated by the exhaled jet propagation, and a second stage affected by the ventilation configuration. The observation of transient particle concentration variation cannot be deducted from steady-state simulation. Furthermore, many efforts have been made to reveal the effect of ventilation types, relative orientation between the occupants, sneezing and coughing velocities, in addition to droplet size distribution on the transient spread of exhaled droplets in variable types of indoor environments using CFD and experimental simulations. Mui et al. [14] investigated by numerical simulations variable velocities and orientations of sneezing under mixed ventilation (MV) and displacement ventilation (DV) schemes. They concluded that the spread of droplets in the room was faster under MV than under DV. Gao and Niu [15] conducted a numerical study in a room occupied by two persons sitting opposite to each other. They concluded that the propagation of the high momentum sneezed jet in the horizontal direction is one of the main causes of cross-contamination between the occupants [15]. Licina et al. [16] investigated experimentally the effect of the distance of cough source from an exposed occupant, airflow velocity and direction on the IPE. They observed that increasing the separating distance between the exposed person and the location of the cough source decreases the peak exposure with an increased exposure delay time after the cough. They also reported that assisting flow from below (which is the case of DV) decreased the personal exposure with the increase of supplied air velocity. Chen and Zhao [8] studied particle distribution resulting from the different respiratory activities (breathing, coughing, and sneezing) for a wide particle sizes range extending from 0.1 to 200 \u03bcm. They showed that the exhalation velocity and the droplet size with initial diameter from 10 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm largely affected the particle distribution [8].",

            "text": "Displacement ventilation is known to provide good IAQ in the occupied zone [17], [18], [19]. It was reported to have a high efficiency in the reduction of disease transmission when particles were generated by low momentum respiratory activities (normal breathing) as the upward convective plumes of the infected person carried nearly 100% of the exhaled particles to be exhausted at the ceiling level [18], [20]. On the other hand, it was shown that higher momentum respiratory activities degraded the effectiveness of DV system in providing good IAQ in the occupied zone because they lead to a horizontal spread and accumulation of infected particles at the breathing level [11], [21], [22]. The performance of DV system in terms of removal of particles resulting from TRA was investigated by experimentation and CFD simulations. Gao et al. [23] studied the lock-up phenomenon of human exhaled droplets in a room ventilated by DV and conducted CFD simulations to determine the IPE resulting from TRA [15]. Seepana and Lai [6] observed experimentally and by CFD that concentration peaks at the breathing height in DV were relatively high compared to MV due mainly to high sneezing velocity and thermal stratification. However, experimental and CFD techniques have high cost and computational time. Therefore, simplified modeling is an essential design tool for capturing the principal physics involved at low computational time [24]. Habchi et al. [18] developed a simplified zonal model to assess the risk of cross-contamination between occupants resulting from normal breathing activities in office buildings ventilated by DV. They extended their model to account for HMRA by coupling between two particles' transport models [11]. Nevertheless, their developed models were steady hence they were not able to assess the variation with time of the IPE resulting from TRA as sneezing and coughing.",

There have been extensive reviews [7], [30] on the size distribution of human exhaled droplets. Nicas et al. [30] found a correlation between the equilibrium diameter of the completely evaporated particle (deq) and the initial diameter (di) where deq = 0.44 di and this correlation was adopted in several studies [31], [32], [33]. Chen and Zhao [8] found that when the normalized evaporation time was lower than 0.051, the evaporation time can be neglected in the modeling. The coughing process has been simulated in several works with variable cough velocities. Gupta et al. [34] and Kwon et al. [35] conducted experiments on a number of human subjects to determine initial velocities of a cough and characterize the coughing process. Zhu et al. [10] showed that the peak cough velocity varied from 6 to 22 m/s. Chao et al. [36] reported that the average expiration air velocity was 11.7 m/s for coughing which is close to the average value of 11.2 m/s found by Gupta et al. [34]. Accordingly, the cough velocity was varied in the range of [6 m/s; 22 m/s] in this study. Furthermore, Gupta et al. [34] found that the average mouth opening for males during a cough is equal to 4 cm2 which was used in several cough studies [37], [38]. Therefore, this value was adopted in the current work corresponding to an equivalent mouth diameter of nearly 2.25 cm.",

The frequently encountered heat sources (occupants, lighting, external heat from walls) are considered. The lighting load was set to 100 W and wall heat fluxes to 200 W. The case study is selected to represent typical office load at 40 W/m2 of floor area based on upper limit of load removal by DV system [41], [42]. The generality of the obtained results is due to the fact that office spaces are usually configured in modular workstation units where each unit would have identical number of occupants as well as electrical load. One occupant generated particles transiently during 1 s simulating a cough released by an infected person while the second occupant was healthy simulating the exposed person. In order to assess the risk of HMRA, the effect of different variables such DV flow rate, coughing velocity, particle diameter, and distance between the occupants on cross-infection is studied. The DV supply flow rate is varied in the range of [50 L/s \u2013 200 L/s] and the supply temperature is fixed to 22 \u00b0C [11]. In fact, Habchi et al. [18] have shown that a flow rate of 100 L/s is required to insure both thermal comfort and IAQ for typical office spaces loaded by 40 W/m2 ventilated by DV system considering normal respiratory activities. Then they extended their model to consider HMRA [11] but they considered continuous generation which might over-predict the IPE. In this study, a typical cough velocity in the interval of 6 m/s to 22 m/s and an exhalation area of 4 cm2\n[34], [43] are used. Particle diameter is varied in the range of 1 \u03bcm\u201350 \u03bcm and the distance between the occupants is varied between 0.5 m and 3 m [11].",

Logarithmic scale was used for the figure's axis for clarity of illustration. Three stages can be defined with respect to time for the different DV supply flow rates (Fig 6). The first stage is dominated by the propagation and decay of the exhaled jet (Fig. 6a) and is very fast lasting for few seconds (Table 2a\n). In the second stage, particles are redistributed by the ventilation system for several minutes. A final stage is the removal stage by deposition and upward transport by the DV system and has the largest period (Fig. 6a). The observation of different exposure stages is in agreement with the findings of Xiaoping et al. [8]. Table 2a summarizes the periods of the three stages for each DV flow rate. The period of these three stages varied with the DV flow rate. The larger the flow rate is, the lower are the durations of the three stages (Fig. 6a and Table 2a). Furthermore, the effect of the DV flow rate on the duration of a stage is highest for the third stage and lowest for the first stage (Table 2a).",

This observation is in agreement with the findings of Licina et al. [16]. A second inhaled concentration peak (redistribution peak) at DV supply flow rate below 75 L/s appears during the second stage since the stratification height is close to the breathing level which results in accumulating particles in the breathing zone (Fig. 6a). As the DV flow rate increases from 50 to 75 L/s, the second peak is reduced and completely disappears for a flow rate of 100 L/s while the influence of the DV flow rate is less significant on the first peak which is dominated by the horizontal propagation of the exhaled jet (Fig. 6a).",

Fig. 8\na and b illustrate respectively the effect of the particle diameter on the variation with time of the normalized concentration at the breathing level of the exposed person and the infection index. With the increase of particle diameter, the gravitational settling effect opposing the upward transport of particles within the microclimate zones is strengthened leading to particle accumulation within the occupied zone. On the other hand, particle deposition by gravitation increases acting as a sink of particles. These two counter effects of increased particle diameter results in non-monotone variation of the concentration with particle diameter. This explains the fact that the IPE is higher when particle diameter is increased from 1 to 20 \u03bcm due to the opposition of particle removal by the upward DV. For larger particle diameters, the deposition by gravitation becomes dominant playing a major role in decreasing IPE (Fig. 8).",

As the distance between occupants increases, the microclimate zone 2 relating the occupants is larger. Therefore, the IPE is reduced as the exhaled jet decay is higher reducing contaminant transmission to the exposed person with a larger time delay. These findings are consistent with the ones of Licina et al. [16]. The effect of the distance on the IPE is reduced in stages 2 and 3 compared with stage 1 due to the decay of the exhaled jet. Fig. 10\nrepresents the variation of the total inhaled dose with distance between the occupants showing that as the separating distance is reduced the rate of increase of the total inhaled dose is incremented and becomes significantly high below 1 m.

            "text": "The physical effect of different parameters (DV flow rate, coughing velocity, particle diameter, and distance between the occupants) on particle behavior computed from the transient model is consistent with the conclusions made from the steady-model [11]. Therefore, steady modeling is helpful in understanding the physics affecting particle spread resulting from HMRA. In order to compare the ability of steady and transient modeling in predicting the IPE, the inhaled dose during the first stage (which is dominated by the jet propagation) was calculated for both models. The inhaled dose computed by transient modeling was calculated using the concentration profile obtained from the transient simulation. On the other hand, the inhaled dose obtained by steady modeling was computed using the steady-state concentration [11]. Fig. 11\nillustrates the comparison of the inhaled dose predicted by transient and steady modeling for variable DV flow rate, cough velocity, and distance between the occupants. Steady modeling significantly over-predicts the IPE (Fig. 11). For instance, if the threshold inhaled dose is set to 10\u22125 kg, for a cough velocity of 22 m/s during 1 s, 1 \u03bcm particles in diameter, and a separating distance of 1 m transient modeling predicts a minimum required DV flow rate of 75 L/s while steady modeling predicts than even an oversized flow rate of 200 L/s is not enough (Fig. 11a). Furthermore, for a DV flow rate of 100 L/s, 1 \u03bcm particles in diameter, and a separating distance of 1 m transient modeling predicts that the whole coughing velocity range is acceptable while steady modeling lead to the conclusion that the maximum possible coughing velocity is 10.25 m/s (Fig. 11b). Finally, for a DV flow rate of 100 L/s and a cough velocity of 22 m/s during 1 s, and 1 \u03bcm particles in diameter, the minimum required distance between the occupants is nearly 0.5 m by transient modeling while it is 2.15 m by steady modeling (Fig. 11c). Therefore, steady modeling should not be used to predict the inhaled dose since it leads to largely over-predicted values.",

Within the set of studied conditions, the larger is the flow rate, the lower are the durations of the three stages and the effect of the DV flow rate on particle behavior is the highest for the third stage and the lowest for the first stage due to the decay of the exhaled jet with time. The inhaled dose during the first stage is the highest and is largely affected by the cough velocity, the particle diameter and the distance between the occupants. As the cough velocity increases, the IPE is increased since the quantity of the generated droplets and their momentum increases. As the separating distance is reduced, the rate of increase of the total inhaled dose is incremented and becomes significantly high below 1 m. For particle diameters above 30 \u03bcm, the deposition by gravitation becomes dominant playing a major role in decreasing the IPE.",
