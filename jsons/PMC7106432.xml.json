            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus which appeared in the Arabian Peninsula in June 2012 [1]. The MERS-CoV belongs to the order of Nidovirales, the family of Coronaviridae and the genus of Betacoronavirus\n[2]. Coronaviruses are large enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect birds and mammals [3]. Since the mid-1960s, human coronaviruses were known for causing common cold (HcoV-229 and OC43), and in the 2000s they were found to cause bronchiolitis (NL63) and pneumonia mainly during the SARS epidemic (HKU-1 and SARS-CoV) [4]. Although asymptomatic infections have been reported, the MERS-CoV causes severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and multiple-organ failure leading to a high mortality rate [5]. A recently published analysis showed that patients with severe disease had at least one underlying condition, including diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac disease and chronic renal disease [6]. This study also showed that both community-acquired and health care associated MERS-CoV infections occur in patients with chronic comorbid conditions [7]. As of 11 June, 699 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to the World Health Organization, including at least 209 deaths [8]. Several cases had been described in other countries than the Arabian Peninsula but all patients had a history of travel to the Middle East, except secondary cases described in UK and France [9], [10].",

Futhermore, detection of viral RNA in samples from the upper respiratory tract such as nasal and throat swabs, or nasopharyngeal aspirates, may remain negative while lower respiratory tract samples are positive [11]. To date, only few studies have reported detection of MERS-CoV RNA in blood, urine and stool samples [11], [12]. However, many questions remain unsolved, and recently it was underlined that additional data are needed to document the natural history of the infection, the excretion pattern and viral kinetics during infection, and the best samples for optimal Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) yield [6].",

Sample quality was assessed by real-time RT-PCR targeting the GAPDH house-keeping gene. Positive control for UpE and Orf1a real-time RT-PCR was an in vitro transcribed RNA, combining the sequences of the Orf1a gene (from nucleotide 11,172 to nucleotide 11,414) and the UpE gene (from nucleotide 27,357 to nucleotide 27,760) as the positive strand, designed based on the first published sequence of MERS-CoV [15].

Our data confirm previous studies showing that the detection of viral RNA from oronasal swabs can be negative even though MERS-CoV RNA was detected in tracheobronchial aspirates throughout the course of infection in case of fatal outcome [12]. It has been previously reported that samples collected from the lower respiratory tract were more relevant for diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection [9], [11], [12]. Here, we show that these samples are also more relevant for the follow-up of MERS-CoV infection. Since respiratory viral excretion was sustained for more than one month after the onset of infection, standard, contact, and airborne precautions must remain unchanged and applied correctly to avoid nosocomial transmission, which is still possible as described in several countries, including transmission to healthcare professionals [11], [16]. However, the question of MERS virus viability in different samples, and hence infectivity of these samples remains unanswered. By comparison with other respiratory viruses, in immunocompetent patients, Influenzavirus RNA detection was detected for a few days while a long-term detection of coronavirus RNA has been shown previously in severe immunocompromised patients [17], [18]. Detection of human coronaviruses RNA in stool samples has been observed [19], [20] but, excepted for SARS-CoV, the duration of the detection of human coronaviruses RNA in stool samples of patients was never studied [21], [22]. Human coronaviruses RNA was never detected in urine of patients with exception for SARS-CoV RNA (Lau et al. [22]).",

During the previous SARS-CoV outbreak, virus RNA was detected in the plasma and sera of infected patients at the acute phase of infection [23], [24].

Detection of viral RNA in urine samples has previously been described [12] but only at the onset of infection, with low quantitative amounts of virus. Here, we describe long-term excretion of MERS-CoV in urine samples in a patient with renal failure. MERS-CoV has a tropism for human kidney cells that could explain renal failure [25]. Interestingly, both patients developed renal failure requiring renal replacement, but the virus was only found in the urinary tract of the viremic patient. However, the relationship between the virus renal tropism and the physiopathology of the renal failure is not so clear, and the questions of independent renal viral replication and/or active urinary secretion of the virus remain unsolved. Of note, the detection of viral RNA in one dialysate sample was negative, but it is difficult to conclude in only one sample.",

Likewise, a previous study describing a fatal outcome, reported that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in samples collected from the lower respiratory tract, in whole blood, and in urine and stool samples [12].
