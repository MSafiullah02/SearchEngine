Consequently, the NR production was increasingly left in the hands of the aged population, which made the maintenance of high quality and high production difficult in Malaysia.

In advancing from the initial to higher stages of innovative activities, Top Glove and Kossan showed similar trajectories. Both firms initially acquired basic knowledge and technology from the MRB. At the intermediate stage, they gained from public assistance in the provision of technologies of practical use (Kawano 2017). However, at the highest upgrading stage, Top Glove and Kossan relied on their own efforts to develop human resources and in-house R&D and to formulate business strategies to secure niche markets in the developing countries or low-income countries not targeted by multinational pharmaceutical companies. In these markets, Top Glove and Kossan operated as original design manufacturers (ODMs) and original brand manufacturers (OBMs). However, they remained in the OEM business to keep cordial relationships with foreign pharmaceutical customers. This is because they understood that glove manufacturing is a niche industry tied to natural resources susceptible to price fluctuations on the one hand and subject to market control by foreign pharmaceutical companies on the other. Top Glove and Kossan departed from the \u201c catching up\u201d strategy central to the East Asian development model; their business strategies combined catching up and reaching down to create original development styles. Their development paths indicate alternative ways of acquiring and creating the technological and managerial capacity to innovate (Kawano 2017).",

Rice being the most important commodity in the Thai economy, neither state nor society paid much attention to rubber except in the southern region. However, when Malaysia diversified into oil palm cultivation, the Thai government foresaw an eventual shortage of rubber in the market and considered the potential for rubber cultivation in North and Northeast Thailand. An experimental plantation was set up in the Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center. The success of this plantation led the government to launch its rubber promotion policy in 1989, encouraging rubber cultivation in the North and Northeast. The first phase of this policy (1989\u20131996) saw the expansion of rubber cultivation by approximately 280,000 rai (44,800 ha) in the Northeast.

However, the expansion of rubber-planted areas did not really take off until after 2003.5 The most difficult problem was the unsuitability of the natural environment. Unlike the South, the North and Northeast of Thailand have lower rainfall, generally insufficient for Hevea brasiliensis (para rubber), the species of rubber tree that requires an annual average rainfall exceeding 1,600 mm. To overcome this obstacle, the government set up four rubber research centers, including Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center and Nong Khai Rubber Research Center in the Northeast area. These centers conducted R&D activities in experimental plantations to create new clones suitable for the new planting areas in the Northeast. The original prototype clone, RRIM 600, was sourced from Malaysia.

Malaysia\u2019s largest customer was Michelin in France, while Indonesia\u2019s largest customer was Goodyear in the United States. Most companies ignored Thailand because its RSS was of low grade (Suehiro 1989).",

Even as they gained a larger share of the global tire market, Japanese companies were only able to make cheaper tires using low-quality raw materials and low-level technology. However, when one of the Japanese companies, Bridgestone, relocated some of its production facilities to Thailand, it eventually brought a radical change to the Thai rubber industry. The company brought profound transformation of the production and distribution systems in Thailand that was popularly dubbed the \u201c Bridgestone Revolution.\u201d Bridgestone introduced the process management system, skill training, new and faster container-based transportation methods, and direct NR purchase from smallholders. The production of RSS in Thailand increased, with most of the output being exported to Japan until the 1990s (Suehiro 1989).",

However, quite unlike the rise of local firms in Malaysia\u2019s glove manufacturing, the emergence of tire manufacturing in Thailand has been led by foreign firms. This difference partially accounts for Thailand\u2019s lower performance in the downstream segment in comparison with Malaysia. First of all, the number of domestic rubber manufacturing firms is relatively small in Thailand. Diverse rubber products were manufactured by no more than 216 rubber manufacturers in 2014 (RRIT various years). In contrast, a small number of foreign firms (such as the large tire producers) receive roughly 80\u201390% of the rubber industry\u2019s revenue. In fact, Thailand is the world\u2019s second largest producer of examination gloves, having 17% of the market (Nopkit 2017). The gloves are produced by about 45 foreign and local companies, mainly those located in Southern Thailand (T.R.I. Global 2016). Even so, foreign companies from Malaysia, China, India, and Australia operate the large facilities producing higher grade products (Interview 4). Moreover, Thai public research institutes are weak in R&D for downstream activities. Facing economic uncertainty, the rising influence of China, and stronger competition from neighboring countries, the Thai rubber industry will need to shift more clearly to high value-added rubber-based manufacturing. To do so, a broader involvement of the government and public research institutes in R&D activities will be required.",

However, as the development potential of the rubber industries in Malaysia and Thailand indicates, the standard views of technological upgrading may have overlooked an option open to resource-endowed emerging states to avoid the \u201c middle-income trap.\u201d That option is to seek technological upgrading and management improvement in resource-based industries such as Malaysia\u2019s glove manufacturing and Thailand\u2019s production and processing of NR. These sectors exploited a common source of strength\u2014rubber as raw material\u2014that is not usually regarded as a part of the East Asian development model. However, each rubber industry succeeded on the basis of mixed state development strategies, public and private R&D, dynamic entrepreneurship, and public-private linkages.
