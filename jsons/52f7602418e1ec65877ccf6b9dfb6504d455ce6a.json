Over the last century, the elucidation of viral oncogenic roles in many cancer types has provided fundamental knowledge on carcinogenetic mechanisms and established a basis for the early intervention of virus-related cancers.

This review discusses the recent advances of genome-editing tools for treating tumorigenic viruses and their corresponding cancers, the challenges that must be overcome before clinically applying such genome-editing technologies, and more importantly, the potential solutions to these challenges.",

Traditional antiviral therapies against HBV infection involve using nucleoside analogs (NAs) and interferons [36] . NAs or interferons only suppress HBV replication in the cytoplasm but cannot eliminate the HBV latent-pool covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus [35, 37, 38] . The cccDNA in the nucleus is a pool of viral escape mutants [39] that play key roles in drug resistance and viral rebound. Thus, few patients remain free of HBV infection after withdrawing NAs and interferon treatments [40] .

The group found that the cccDNA derived from infectious HBV were cleaved using CRISPR/Cas9. Bloom and colleagues were the first to disrupt the HBV genome using TALENs [46] . The team designed four TALENs targeting the S, C, and pol ORFs of the HBV genome. TALENs and HBV-genome-expressing plasmids were transfected into Huh7 cells. Suppressed viral replication was detected because of TALENs targeting the S and C ORFs. However, the TALENs targeting the pol ORF did not decrease the HBsAg levels in HepG2.2.15 cells. The team also established a mouse model by injecting HBVcarrying plasmids and corresponding TALEN plasmids by using the hydrodynamic injection method. S and C TALENs inhibited HBV viral replication in the hydrodynamic mouse model [46] . Meanwhile, Zhen et al. designed 12 sgRNAs targeting the C, pol, S, and X ORFs [10] . S1 sgRNA decreased HBsAg levels by 61% in HepG2.2.15 cells. Among the 12 sgRNAs, those targeting the S and X ORFs inhibited cccDNA expression prominently. HBsAg was decreased by 93% by using sgRNA X3 and S1 in the hydrodynamic mouse model. Ramanan et al. designed 24 sgRNAs against the C, pol, and X ORFs [48] . The scholars reported decreased pgRNA levels and HBsAg production in HepG2 hepatoma cells expressing HBV plasmid. In vivo experiments using a hydrodynamic mouse model revealed decreased HBsAg secretion and viremia. Lin et al. were the first to inhibit HBV replication in cultured cells and hydrodynamic mice using CRISPR/Cas9 [49] . The group designed eight sgRNAs targeting the C, pol, S, and X ORFs of the HBV genotype A. HBV plasmid, sgRNA plasmids, and the Cas9 plasmid were cotransfected into Huh7 cells. Lowered core and surface protein levels were observed. The team also detected decreased HBsAg serum levels treated with CRISPR/Cas9 using a hydrodynamic mouse model expressing HBV [49] . Chen et al. designed TALENs targeting conserved sequences among the A-D genotypes [36] . The team detected reduced cccDNA levels. Injecting HBV-expressing plasmid and TALEN plasmids into mice hydrodynamically resulted in reduced serum HBV DNA and liver HBV pgRNA. The results indicated viral transcription and replication inhibition in vivo. The combined use of TALENs and interferon-\u03b1 in vitro showed synergistic effects in inhibiting cccDNA and viral transcription [36] . Kennedy et al. reported inhibited HBV DNA and cccDNA in HBV-infected HepAD38 and HepaRG cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the S and C regions [45] . Meanwhile, Karimova et al. designed CRISPR/Cas9-nickase to inactivate HBV in vitro [50] . In particular, the researchers designed sgRNAs that target the conserved sequences of the S and X ORFs. CRISPR/Cas9nickase inactivated the HBV in chronically and de novo infected cells. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9-nickase offered an alternative means to eradicate HBV infection.",

The multiplexed treatment of different HBV regions may be more effective for future clinical research [51] . Considering the heterogeneity of the HBV genome, Liu et al. designed eight sgRNAs that target the conserved regions of 26 different HBV genotypes and observed the HBV replication inhibition of these different genotypes. Meanwhile, Wang et al. designed 15 sgRNAs against the HBV A-D genotypes [52] . Eleven pairs of dual sgRNAs were produced among the 15 sgRNAs. Dual sgRNA-mediated HBsAg and HBeAg suppression was more effective than using a single sgRNA. Compared with genome editing using only one sgRNA, the collaboration of different sgRNAs could boost the inhibition efficiency, broaden the targeting range, and prevent escape caused by viral mutations [51] .",

Until 2012, 35.3 million people were estimated to be infected with HIV-1 [53] . Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) enabled the treatment of HIV infection as a chronic non-terminal disease [8] . However, HAART only temporarily inhibits viral replication. When antiviral treatment is attenuated, the latent pool of HIV infection is reactivated to produce viruses [8] . HAART causes severe side effects, including coronary artery disease [54] , osteoporosis [55] , and kidney failure [56] . Moreover, HAART requires lifelong treatment. High costs and lifelong treatments for HIV/AIDs have added massive burden to individuals and countries where HIV/AIDS is epidemic. siRNA has been used to combat HIV infection. However, because of its incomplete suppression and unpredicted off-target effects, siRNA is not widely applied to treat HIV infection [57, 58] . Hence, an improved means of inhibiting persistent HIV infection or eliminating the virus must be developed.",

The CD4 receptor is the primary attachment receptor for HIV, but disrupting CD4 appears impractical because of the marker's essential role in immune function [53] . A breakthrough was achieved in the field when a Berlin patient received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant to cure his myeloid leukemia [59] . After the transplant, the HIV-1 infection became undetectable, which suggested that HIV/AIDS was functionally cured in this patient [60, 61] . Researchers found that the donor hematopoietic progenitor cells possess a 32-bp (base pair) deletion of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 locus (CCR5D32). CCR5-depleted cells are naturally resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection [61] . This discovery highlighted that deleting the CCR5 coreceptor could possibly cure HIV-1. In late-stage infected patients, 50% of HIV infections use CXCR4 or CCR5 [62] [63] [64] . Another patient who suffered from anaplastic largecell lymphoma was transplanted with tissue from a donor bearing the CCR5D32 mutation [65] . However, the patient eventually suffered from CXCR4-tropic viral infection. Therefore, CXCR4 is also a necessary target.",

The mice engrafted with ZFN-modified CD4 + T cells displayed a lower HIV-1 viral load than those of the corresponding controls [67] . Holt et al. disrupted the CCR5 gene in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSC) cells by using ZFNs [66] . CCR5edited HSC cells were proven resistant to HIV-1 infection. Tebas et al. described the first phase I clinical trial to treat HIV patients using ZFNs [69] . TALENs were also used to cleave the CCR5 with high efficiency [70] . CCR5 deletion using TALENs was reported to prevent HIV-1 infection [71] . CRISPR/Cas9 was also effective in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived monocytes/macrophages (latent storage site for HIV-1 infection) [72] . Because the HIV-1 genome is highly mutable, viral escape mutants should be confronted using sgRNAs targeting different regions of the HIV-1 genome [73] .",

ZFNs and TALENs must function as dimers [83] [84] [85] [86] , whereas CRISPR/Cas9 is efficient as a monomer. ZFNs recognize genomic sites by using ZFPs, and redesigning ZFPs is necessary to change the target loci. TALENs entail RVDs to mediate sequence recognition. To target other genomic sites, researchers need to synthesize another set of RVDs, which will subsequently be linked to the FokI domain. For CRISPR/Cas9, a \"seed sequence\" within the crRNA and a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence are required for site-specific recognition [21] . The CRISPR/Cas9 system can be reconstructed to cleave other genomic sites by redesigning the crRNA. Because tracrRNA and crRNA can be linked to form a sgRNA, redesigning the sgRNA sequence is sufficient to guide the Cas9 protein to other genomic sites [21, 22] .",

For delivery in vivo, Hu et al. used the TurboFect in vivo Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) to transfect TALEN plasmids into the vagina of K14-HPV16 mice [12] . The researchers observed that the TALENs mainly accumulated in target organs (vagina and cervix) with minimized toxicity or side effects to the whole organism. Moreover, the delivery via vagina reduced hepatic first-pass metabolism and maintained a high endonuclease concentration in the target organs. Delivery via vagina is also suitable for drugs not fit for systemic use. Hu et al. proved the efficacy of TALENs delivery to treat cervical malignancies in K14-HPV16 mice [12] . Compared with TALENs, whether ZFNs and CRISPR/Cas9 exert the same effect, or even enhanced efficiency, remains to be investigated. In addition, some improvements should be made prior to clinical application to counteract cervical malignancies. For example, the endonucleases must be in the form of suppository, gel, or cream to maintain a long-term exposure to the human vagina. Menstruation cycles and the vaginal pH must also be considered [12] . The duration, dosage, and cost must also be carefully examined.",

The scholars suspended CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid and a singlestranded DNA oligo donor in 2 mL saline and subsequently injected this suspension through the mouse tail vein for over 5-7 s. The group then detected corrected Fah mutation in 1/250 hepatocytes. However, to inject a large liquid volume over such a short time may cause high pulmonary artery pressure and acute kidney failure.

However, TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 exceed the packaging capacity of AAV. Therefore, the two monomers of TALENs must be delivered separately using two AAV vectors [44] . For CRISPR/Cas9, a smaller Cas9 derived from Staphylococcus aureus called saCas9 can be delivered using AAV [90] . Lentivirus holds a larger delivery capacity than that of AAV; hence, TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 are deliverable by lentiviral vectors [91, 92] . High transduction efficiency is also an advantage of lentivirus delivery. Lentiviruses may integrate into target cells to maintain the stable expression of genome-editing tools to prevent the virus from resurgence. However, the viruses also tend to integrate into the host genome and cause genomic instability [92] .",

            "text": "Off-target effects vary depending on the endonucleases being tested. To reduce the off-target cleavage, scholars synthesized an obligate FokI heterodimer. DNA cleavage occurs only when the two ZFN subunits bind close to each other and form an obligate dimer [83] [84] [85] . A ZFN nickase was also developed to reduce off-target cleavage [95] . Nickase activates the homologous recombination repair mechanism instead of non-homologous end joining and thereby reduces off-targets. Similar to ZFNs, TALENs were fused to obligate FokI heterodimer to improve specificity. Because the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is only determined by the PAM sequence and the short sgRNA sequence, off-target effects can be high [21, 22, 96] . To reduce off-targets, researchers have applied several methods. For instance, additional two guanine nucleotides were added to the 5\u2032 end of the sgRNA sequence to reduce off-targets [97] . Short sgRNAs (17-18 nt) truncated at the 5\u2032 end of the 20 nt sgRNA sequence decreased off-target effects by 5000-fold with high ontarget activity [98] . Mutation of the HNH domain or the RuvC domain of Cas9 creates a nickase [21] . Nickases only induce a nick on one DNA strand. Therefore, paired nickases with offset sgRNAs are required to induce DSBs and thereby enhancing specificity [86] . Fusing a catalytically inactive Cas9, termed dCas9, onto a FokI domain is another way to reduce off-targets [99] [100] [101] . Because dimeric endonucleases are sensitive to spacer length between left and right monomers, an optimum spacer length exists between two monomers [102, 103] . Binding requires a 15-25 bp spacer between two monomers to function correctly; this spacer improves the specificity of the system without diminishing the on-target effects [101] .",
