The occurrence and the diversity of swine PV were therefore investigated in pig slurry collected in Italy, to contribute towards filling this gap in knowledge. Methods and Results: Twenty-two slurry samples underwent analysis by nested PCR and DNA sequencing using published and newly designed specific primer pairs for Sus scrofa papillomavirus (SsPV) type 1 and 2 (SsPV1 and 2), along with degenerate PV-specific primers targeting the major coat protein L1 and the helicase protein E1. Overall, three samples (13\u00c16%) were positive for SsPV1 by specific primers, and nucleotide (nt) sequences showed 99-100% nt identity with SsPV1 variant a (EF395818), while SsPV2 was not found in any sample. Using generic primers, eight samples (36\u00c14%) were tested positive for human papillomavirus (HPV), and were characterized as follows: b1-HPV8, b1-HPV14, b1-HPV206, b2-HPV113, b2-HPV120 and c1-HPV173. Moreover, one unclassified c-type was detected. Conclusions: Both swine and human PVs were detected in pig slurry in this study. The unexpected presence of HPV in pig waste could be explained as the result of an improper use of the sewage collection pits and/or with improper procedures of the operators.

This study reports the first detection of swine PV in Italy, specifically SsPV1 variant a. SsPV1 is the prototype virus for the species Dyodeltapapillomavirus 1, the single representative of the genus Dyodeltapapillomavirus, detected from swab samples taken from the healthy skin of two female domestic pigs in Belgium (Stevens et al., 2008) . Little is known about the diseases that SsPV causes. A few studies documented fibropapillomatosis in piglets and transmissible genital papilloma in pigs (Rang and Dimigen 1971; Rieke 1980; Vitovec et al., 1999) . However, these were before molecular techniques made it possible to sequence the genome and therefore, the infectious agent could not be characterized precisely. More recently, Nishiyama et al. (2011) examined a cutaneous fibropapillomatosis on the head and the back skin of a 4-month-old piglet, but PV antigen and DNA were not detected in these lesions by immunohistochemistry and PCR, therefore the fibropapillomatosis was considered hamartomatous rather than infectious. However, the generic MY09/11 primers used in that study might have failed to detect swine PV. In the present study, a wide panel of broad-range primers has been used, including MY09/11 and FAP primers, the latter previously proved to allow the amplification of different animal PVs (Antonsson and Hansson, 2002; Li et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2013) . However, only specific primers for SsPV provided positive results. It is likely that esophytic or endophytic lesions such wart papillomas and venereal papillomas are more common than known in the swine population. Since animals with lesions are rapidly removed from the herds, the identification of PV is rarely performed. As consequence, the only available SsPV sequences in GeneBank and in PAVE database are the SsPV1 variants a and b (EF395818 and EF395819) found in healthy skin of domestic pigs (Stevens et al., 2008) , and the SsPv2 sequence (KY817993) found in a wild boar with esophytic papillomatosis (Link et al., 2017) . In our study, positive results for SsPv2 were not found.

The results of the present study suggest that these PVs could be more widespread than previously considered.

The next-generation sequencing in swine and slurry samples could open new avenues to exploring SPV diversity. The potential risks for humans linked to the presence of swine and human PV in pig slurry are still unknown.
