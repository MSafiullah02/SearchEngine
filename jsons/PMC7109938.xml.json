The initial illness is self-limited, but it is sometimes followed by fatal neurological symptoms, such as aseptic meningitis, brain-stem encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and acute flaccid paralysis similar to paralytic poliomyelitis, particularly in infants and young children [1, 2]. Subsequently, some survivors of severe cases are left with long-term neurological sequelae, delayed neurodevelopment, and reduced cognitive functioning [3]. EV71 outbreaks have been reported periodically throughout the world. The largest and most severe outbreak occurred in Taiwan in 1998; 129,106 cases of herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, 405 cases of neurological and cardiopulmonary complications, and 78 deaths were reported [2]. Since then, EV71 infection has become endemic in Taiwan and caused >40 deaths per year in 2000 and 2001",

Infected mice were given 1 intraperitoneal injection of PBS or ribavirin (100 mg/kg) daily for 9 days, starting 2 h after infection.

In separate experiments, the brains and spinal cords of infected mice treated with ribavirin or PBS were collected on day 5 after infection.

Accordingly, we next investigated the viral loads in the mouse central nervous system on day 5 after infection. Our data showed that ribavirin treatment reduced the viral loads in the brains (without brain-stem region), brain stems, and spinal cords of EV71-infected mice (figure 3C). Additional experiments showed that the virus harvested from the tissues of mice receiving ribavirin treatment was still sensitive to ribavirin treatment (data not shown)",

The IC50 of ribavirin for EV71 is 65 \u03bcg/mL (266 \u03bcmol/L) in both RD and SK-N-SH cells, which is lower than that found for other neurotropic viruses, such as Nipah virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (IC50 values of 100, 71, and 134 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) [14, 15]. Previous studies showed that 80\u2013400 mg/kg ribavirin daily reduces the mortality in rats with encephalitis induced by Junin virus [11], in rhesus monkeys with encephalitis induced by Rift Valley fever virus [12], and in mice with myocarditis induced by coxsackievirus B3 [6]. On the basis of these studies, 100 mg/kg ribavirin was chosen to treat EV71-infected mice, and this dose showed a protective effect. In our study, ribavirin was given to infected mice during the viremic phase (data not shown). Further studies are needed to test the efficacy of ribavirin therapy beginning later in the disease course in mice",

Under these regimens, the plasma concentration of ribavirin is 2.5 \u03bcg/mL, which is comparable to that found in HCV-infected patients treated with the drug [7]. The concentration of ribavirin in cerebrospinal fluid is 70% of that in plasma in humans [16]. Interestingly, the IC50 of ribavirin for Nipah virus is >40 times higher than the clinically achievable concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. For HCV, the IC50 of ribavirin is 230 \u03bcmol/L (56 \u03bcg/mL), >22 times higher than the plasma concentration [17]. In fact, the IC50 of ribavirin for almost all viruses for which the drug shows therapeutic efficacy in patients\u2014including measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, La Crosse virus, hantavirus virus, and Lassa virus [5, 8, 9, 18\u201321]\u2014are much higher than the plasma concentrations.
