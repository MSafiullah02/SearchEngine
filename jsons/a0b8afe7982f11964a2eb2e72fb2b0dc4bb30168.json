            "text": "Non-invasive neurological imaging is a vital component of acute stroke evaluation. More than 850 U.S. hospitals that perform neurological imaging for stroke utilize RAPID, a software tool to process and disseminate this imaging to physicians caring for patients with suspected acute stroke. In routine use, neuroimaging for AIS-comprising non-contrast CT or MRI of the brain, CT or MR perfusion of the brain, and/or CT or MR angiography of the head and neck-is transmitted in real-time from the point of acquisition to a local server hosting RAPID imaging software (iSchemaView, Inc., Menlo Park, CA). Images are transmitted to the RAPID server in DICOM format with associated metadata that includes patient age, gender, site of imaging, and date and time of image acquisition. These data are processed by the RAPID server and sent to the appropriate clinical teams for patient care. Data are then anonymized by the RAPID server and transmitted to a central data warehouse. Multiple imaging studies occurring in the same patient are combined based on an anonymous patient identifier that is available to the local RAPID server but not the data warehouse.",

RAPID imaging is performed in large numbers at centers distributed across 49 of 50 states in United States. The breadth and depth of sampling inherent in this data is therefore substantial. Moreover, RAPID imaging utilization is generally acquired at the time of presentation and provides nearly real-time insight through an interactive dashboard. In contrast, counts of patients undergoing stroke treatment or discharged with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke may lag by weeks or months due to hospitalization length and inherent delays in public data reporting, limiting their utility in shaping a response to timesensitive public health emergencies.",

Within this interval, aggregated counts of unique patients imaged on each day were generated based on the timestamp of each imaging study in the time zone of the performing hospital. A patient was considered to have undergone imaging on a given day if RAPID was used to process any of the following types of imaging: non-contrast CT or MRI of the brain, CT or MR perfusion of the brain, or CT or MR angiography of the head and neck. Daily counts were subdivided into groups based on key patient demographics, imaging features, and hospital characteristics. Patient demographic data included age and gender. Hospital characteristics included U.S. state and typical daily imaging volume; closely affiliated hospitals that shared a single RAPID server were treated as a single site. Imaging data included automatically calculated volumes of ischemic core and hypoperfusion from CT perfusion data. Ischemic core, which corresponds to acutely but irreversibly injured brain, is estimated within RAPID as regions with greater than 70% relative reduction in cerebral blood flow. Hypoperfusion volume, which corresponds to areas of the brain that are critically hypoperfused regardless of reversibility, is estimated within RAPID as regions with time to maximum of the residue function >6 seconds (Tmax >6 s). Studies with missing data were exceedingly rare (\u22641.0% of data) and excluded only from those subgroups in which these missing data prevented categorization.",

Unlike treatment networks for other acute conditions that have been relatively stable for years, stroke networks and RAPID adoption have evolved significantly since the publication of the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials in 2018. 1,2 Compared to 2019, the demographic profile of RAPID-connected hospitals in 2020 includes a larger number of satellite hospitals that have relatively low stroke volumes and do not perform endovascular thrombectomy. Furthermore, RAPID imaging in 2020 encompasses automated analysis of other types of brain imaging studies besides CT or MR perfusion, which were much less common in early 2019. For example, among patients who underwent RAPID imaging with CT in February 2020, 18% underwent noncontrast head CT alone, 25% underwent CT angiography without CT perfusion, 34% underwent CT perfusion without CT angiography, and 23% underwent CT perfusion and CT angiography.",
