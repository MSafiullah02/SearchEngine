External \u201cenemies\u201d are represented mainly by germs; those of internal origin belong especially to potentially malignant cells that appear in our organisms as a result of the breakdown of their replication mechanisms. Another important biological function of the immune system is the prevention of autoreactive T and B cells activation, respectively, which potentially represent a threat of autoimmune diseases induction. To avoid this possibility, mechanisms of recessive (central) and dominant (peripheral) tolerance were developed. Recessive tolerance is based on deletion of autoreactive T and B cells in the thymus or in the bone marrow, respectively, during the process of their maturation in these primary lymphoid organs [1, 2]. Like other biological systems, the mechanisms of the recessive tolerance are not 100% effective, and a part of autoreactive lymphocytes escape their demise and enter the periphery, the secondary lymphoid organs. Here, when they encounter autoantigens, cross-reactive antigens or when a dysregulation of the immune system develops, they can be activated and induce autoimmune processes. Mechanisms of dominant tolerance mediated mainly by regulatory T cells (Treg) prevent this eventuality. By contacting with autoreactive lymphocytes directly or indirectly, especially by synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines, Treg cells prevent their activation or suppress their effector activity [1, 2].",

NFAT). No systemic disease similar to IPEX happens when there is a deficiency of iTreg cells (in experimental animals); however, inflammatory processes of mucosal surfaces develop (colitis, asthma bronchiale) [16\u201318]. Initially, iTreg and nTreg cells were difficult to distinguish from one another.

In short, MS is characterised by demyelination process in the brain and the spinal cord; the peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.

A relationship between viruses and MS is supported by observations that viral infections frequently precede bouts of the disease. It is possible that IFN-\u03b3, which is produced during the infection, triggers immunopathological events resulting in demyelination [23]. The viruses may possess proteins that resemble the myelin antigens and by the mechanisms of molecular mimicry activate autoreactive T cells. Environmental factors like insufficient supply of vitamin D seem to support MS development [24, 25]. Furthermore, MS prevalence rates may be influenced by the socioeconomic changes in previous decades, which are related to industrialisation, urban living, pollution, occupational exposures to solvents, changes in diet, smoking habits, and so forth.",

LFA-1 and \u03b14\u03b21-integrins in T cells and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells mediate these interactions. VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed and its expression is substantially upregulated by stimulation of cells by cytokines. This mechanism of transmigration into the CNS parenchyma is used mainly by TH1 cells. TH17 cells prefer interaction between their chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCL20 ligands, which are also constitutively expressed in small quantities in membranes of endothelial cells [27, 28]. Likewise, B cells migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is mediated by interaction between their CCR7 and CCL19 in the brain [28].",

They produced various cytokines, especially IL-17 and they themselves killed human neurons and promoted central nervous system inflammation through CD4+ lymphocyte recruitment [23, 33, 34]. However, perhaps more important than IL-17 production is their synthesis of GM-CSF. This cytokine supports attraction of monocytes and dendritic cells to the CNS and their activation, the mechanisms by which they contribute to neuroinflammation. GM-CSF furthermore acts as a positive feedback loop whereby it enhances the synthesis of IL-23 from antigen-presenting cells and so further sustains the activation and maturation of TH17 cells [35].",

Based on the induction of autoimmune processes caused by the FOXP3 gene mutation, it was supposed that defective Treg cells might also contribute to the development of immunopathological processes in \u201cmore common\u201d autoimmune disorders. This supposition has been confirmed. nTreg cells can contribute to the induction of autoimmunity by their decreased numbers, by the breakdown of their function, or simply by the reality that overactivated autoreactive T cells resist their immunosuppressive activities (Figure 2). The role of Treg cells in MS is rather controversial. While there have been reports on reduced frequency of nTreg cells in MS patients [37, 38], the majority of studies have found a similar frequency to the one observed in healthy individuals [39, 40]. However, several functional studies using in vitro suppression assays have documented impairments in Treg cells from MS patients [40\u201343]. What may be the cause for insufficient activities of nTreg cells in MS patients? It is probably a complex defect, such as reduced expression of coinhibitory molecules (CLTA-4, TIM-3, TIGIT) in their membranes, and insufficient synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines [42, 44]. In this context, an interesting finding was reported by Schneider-Hohendorf et al. They disclosed an impaired migratory activity of Treg cells into the CNS in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) [45].",

Now, it represents an independent disease, in which a person's own immune system attacks the optic nerves and spinal cord [32]. Although inflammation may also affect the brain, the lesions are different from those observed in MS. Unlike standard MS, the attacks are not mediated by the immune system's T cells, but rather by antibodies directed against aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a protein in the cell membranes of astrocytes. However, as antibodies belong to IgG1 class, their production requires T cells [56, 57]. Moreover, Varrin-Doyer et al. have brought evidence that T cells from NMO patients proliferated to intact AQP4 or AQP4 peptides [56]. ",

Currently azathioprine, prednisone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulins, or exchange plasmapheresis have been used for the treatment. However, recently it was shown that biological agents might be of some benefit in ameliorating a clinical status of the patients. New monoclonal antibodies, aquapuromab, were developed which also bind to AQP4, however to different epitopes as autoantibodies. Their attachment to AQP4 prevents pathogenic autoantibodies to bind to their targets because of steric hindrance and so to prevent their pathogenic activities. Aquaporumab activates neither the complement system, nor killer (K) cells, which prevents potential damage of target cells they bind with [66].",

It was proved to induce, like IFN-\u03b2, the production of IL-1Ra, a natural inhibitor of IL-1, which results in inhibition of its proinflammatory activities. Furthermore, monocytes/macrophages under the GA activities produce less IL-1 and TNF, that is, the most potent proinflammatory cytokines and IL-12, the cytokine supporting polarisation of na\u00efve T cells into the TH1 subset (Figure 1). On the contrary, it increases the synthesis of immunosuppressive IL-10 [70]. One supposes that GA-activated T cells enter the CNS and develop their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities [71]. GA supports also suppressive activities of Treg cells by the upregulation of their coinhibitory molecules TIGIT and TIM-3 [42, 44, 72].

It is a structural analogue of intracellular sphingosine that is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 in vivo. Fingolimod exerts its effect by mimicking sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and the binding to four of five S1P receptors on lymphocytes results in their internalisation and prolonged downregulation. Without signals from S1P receptors, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells are unable to egress from secondary lymphoid tissues, resulting in a marked decrease of these cells in the periphery and their reduced recruitment to sites of inflammation. Approximately 80% of lymphocytes undergoes this reversible sequestration 3\u20135 hours after fingolimod application [80, 81].",

The rationale of a decrease of B cells for MS (and other autoimmune disorders) treatment is based on their other functions, not only those connected with production of antibodies. B cells belong to antigen-presenting cells too. They express HLA class II molecules, and engulfed protein antigens, previously bound to their immunoglobulin receptors, are then subsequently processed and bound to their grooves. The presentation of the \u201cHLA-molecule - peptide\u201d complex to T cells follows and by receiving costimulatory signals, T cells are activated [86, 87]. By destruction of B lymphocytes, anti-CD20 mAb reduce their number and so downregulate their ability to interact with autoreactive T cells, which results in attenuation of autoimmune processes. Concurrently, a cytokine profile in the microenvironment is changing in support of the induction and expansion of Treg cells [20, 88, 89]. Why was the CD20 molecule selected? The answer is relatively easy: CD20 is expressed on B cell lineage from the pre-B cell stage to the memory B cell stage, but not on plasma cells [90].",

Based on its mechanism of action, daclizumab represented an ideal therapy for T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases too and was subsequently tested in the treatment of inflammatory uveitis and MS. In both of them, it significantly inhibited target organ inflammation. Subsequent studies of mechanisms of its action in MS resulted rather in a surprise; instead of inhibition of T-cell proliferation and production of cytokines, it was shown it had expanded and activated immunoregulatory CD56bright NK cells, which gained access to the brain parenchyma and killed autologous activated T cells [100, 101].",

The studies have disclosed that transfer of MBP-reactive Treg cells prevented disease when given prior to immunisation and prevented relapses when administered after the onset of disease. The effect was seen only when relevant myelin antigen-specific Treg cells were transferred, but not with polyclonal Treg cells [46, 103].

However, there is still a question, which laboratory indicators should be taken into considerations when physicians are thinking over what type of treatment would fit best to a particular MS patient. The followup of particular population of T cells and their subsets in the peripheral blood surely informs a physician about response of the immune system to the therapy. For instance, level of expansion of CD56bright NK cells and the decrease in ratios of T cells (as target cells) to CD56bright NK cells (as effector cells) could represent a useful biomarker indicative of therapeutic response to daclizumab. However, our current knowledge of the great plasticity of T helper cells subsets and their ability of redifferentiation from one subset to another (e.g., TH2 to TH1, etc.) [104] will make us pay more attention to cytokines. If a cytokine profile is more tilted to a proinflammatory on the expense of an anti-inflammatory, it will indicate that the pathological process is more intensive and our therapy is less efficient. For instance, the ratio between anti-inflammatory IL-10 and proinflammatory IL-12 correlates with the disease activity, for example, if patients respond to the IFN-\u03b2 treatment, the IL-10 to IL-12 ratio increases [105].",

For instance, if an MS patient responds to IFN-\u03b2 treatment, the levels of his/her adhesive molecules in the peripheral blood are decreasing [105]. How to treat it, when to change the therapy, and whether a drug combination should be used still remain upon the physician's discretion. Furthermore, MS is not a uniform disease; on the contrary, it has its own subtle differences based on the predominance of one type of immunopathological process over the other, which prevails differently in every MS patient. Obviously, the more we understand the underlying mechanisms and their interconnections, the more basic research will help physicians in their decisions.",

Moreover, DCs in dependence of the processed antigens produce different cytokines.

Further, the number of Treg cells can be in a physiological range; however, there are some defects in Treg-cell function that are intrinsic to Treg cells, for example, they do not synthesise sufficient quantity of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-\u03b2), or there is a breakdown of their interaction with effector T cells. Ultimately, pathogenic effector T cells (Teff) are resistant to suppression by Treg cells owing to factors that are intrinsic to the effector cells or factors that are present in the inflammatory milieu that supports effector T cells resistance.",
