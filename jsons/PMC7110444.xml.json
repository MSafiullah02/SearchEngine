            "text": "The past and present centuries experienced a number of viral outbreaks evolving as epidemics, along with viral endemic-epidemic situations. Until recently, effective antiviral therapies were either experimental, or hazardous, or unaffordable. The A/H1N1 Spanish flu (1917\u20131919) killed more people than the First World War ever (between 30 and 50 million people, depending on the estimates). More recently, the SARS coronavirus epidemics (2003), the A/H5N1 flu epidemics (2005\u20132015), the A/H1N12009p flu epidemics (2009\u20132010), the recent Ebolavirus epidemics (2013\u20132015) proved exceedingly lethal and threatened the global health systems, calling for protection measures of non-exposed populations, prophylaxis to exposed but not yet infected populations and experimental therapy of attacked individuals. Each of those situations\u2014including the early Spanish flu\u2014proposed the use of convalescent plasma therapy. Besides, some viral infections are present under the form of locally or regionally restricted epidemics, with a large attack rate within exposed populations but a low expansion capacity. Those epidemics that are particularly severe in general, and often lethal such as viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) [10] and hantavirus infections, were found eligible for convalescent plasma therapy protocols whenever possible: these are Lassa Fever, Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever, Rift Valley Fever, and Sin Nombre and Puumala virus infections, to cite some. Besides, also, some viral infections evolving as endemic-epidemic, emerging or reemerging situations that were major killers, especially in low-income areas, such as measles, HIV/AIDS and rabies [11] were also found to be eligible for plasma therapy. Lately, viral infections that are not particularly lethal compared to some other previously cited ones but that have threaten or still threaten populations, both in the developing and the economically developed world, and against which efficacious antiviral chemotherapy is limited, have been tested for the opportunity to use specific IVIG: these are chikungunya virus infection [12], dengue virus infection, and possibly others such as hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection [13], and also Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas disease) [14]; of note, despite experimental attempts, Plasmodium falciparum malaria seems to resist plasma therapy or specific Ig benefits.",

One of the largest uses was perhaps for treating tetanus toxoid, with animal sera and then\u2014as of the 60s\u2014with specific human Igs. Only two situations still rely on serum animals: botulism and diphtheria. CMV infection, hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, measles, hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, pertussis, vaccinia and chicken-pox (varicella) [15] can be fought by human sera [4], [6], [7], [8]; indeed, plasma fractionation has been made available back to year 1945 and since then, specific Igs can be made available when convalescent blood individuals are eligible for blood or plasma donation. An HAV epidemics was treated back in 1945 by unfractionated Ig treatment, and then specific\u2014fractionated Igs\u2014were used to treat HAV and HBV infections prior to the large-scale campaigns of vaccination. Less specifically or prophylactically, IVIG treatment has been proposed to treat victims of toxic shock syndrome after ingestion of contaminated food in the 60s. Based on evidence obtained from successful use of either non-fractionated or specific Igs in a few viral infections, immune therapies were given occasionally: in 1953 to fight a smallpox outbreak in India, and in many other occasions, and still as has been proposed during the 2013\u20132015 Ebola crisis [6], [7], [8].",

A look-back study very elegantly provided additional information: compared to antiviral therapies that\u2014for some of them\u2014proved harmful, no blame was posed on convalescent plasma therapy having been performed by means of either unfractionated plasma or purified Igs. Another analysis reports some interest of this therapy with mention to the sustained anti-inflammatory effect which it carries.

The intensity of the 2013\u20132015 outbreak in West-Central Africa has prompted NGOs, WHO, and diverse consortia in the US and Europe to set up protocols for collecting plasma from convalescent individuals, despite uncertainty on the one hand of the viral clearance and on the other hand on the existence and sustainability of protective neutralizing Abs. A general preference has been made for fractionated Igs that can be processed from plasma given by repeated apheresis procedures [55], [56], [57], [58]; alternatively, some practitioners insisted on the interest of therapeutic or specific plasma to bring endothelial healing and plasma procoagulant factors [59]. Plans have been made, and IVIGs have supposedly been prepared in order to be further used when new cases are declared [59], [60], [61]. One study has reported use of convalescent plasma in addition to an antiviral drug in two patients; both recovered without noticeable sequel (although one of them experienced multi-organ failure and necessitated kidney replacement) [62]. The authors indeed concluded that the role of convalescent plasma vs other support care is difficult to delineate.",

Hundred years of practice have not allowed a precise answer to this question; however, there is one constant observation: plasma therapy and hyperimmune Ig therapy must be applied as early as possible after the onset of infection and/or disease manifestation. Regarding the possible mode of action of this therapy, the technologists tend to favor specific Igs from cracked plasma whereas physiologists recognize the additional effect of healing factors preventing excess vascular leakage and procoagulant or antifibrinolytic factors, with direct potential interest. Obviously, infectious diseases that do not present as HFs will be better counteracted by purified Abs; manufacture of monoclonal Abs are indeed strongly wished in these cases, with the example of HIV, where many attempts have been made over a couple of decades [63]. Another virus which displays a high attack rate and can lead to severe pathology, including HF symptoms as seen with DENV could be in theory eligible for plasma or Ig therapy [64]; however, this viral infection is versatile in eliciting neutralizing Abs and it has been proposed that Abs raised to one serotype may even be facilitating towards some of the other three serotypes. Programs are however aimed at eliciting modified Abs that can be protective; DENV is indeed considered as a serious threat in certain parts of the world, with potential to reach milder or temperate areas as the South of Europe [10], [65].",

In all cases, there is benevolence and many of us would pledge for that humane quality is not altered by the money of business system and stays in the field of the voluntary non-remunerated system of blood donation [66]. Obviously, one has to make sure that plasma (and purified Igs/Abs) are devoid of remaining virus (and other pathogens) and protocols, by use of pathogen reduction technologies which are now largely available in economically wealthy countries but must be made available as well in developing countries facing viral outbreaks (as has been the case during the Ebola crisis).",
