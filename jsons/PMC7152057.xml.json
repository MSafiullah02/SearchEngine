            "text": "Successful management of infections in kidney transplant recipients is a function of the immune status of the host and the epidemiology of infectious exposures. Transplant recipients are susceptible to a broad spectrum of infectious pathogens while manifesting diminished signs and symptoms of invasive infection. Thus the diagnosis of infection is more difficult in transplant recipients than in immunologically normal individuals. The interactions between infection, immunosuppression, and immune function often result in clinical syndromes reflecting multiple simultaneous processes, such as infection and graft rejection. Immunocompromised patients tolerate invasive infection poorly, with high morbidity and mortality, lending urgency to the need for an early, specific diagnosis to guide antimicrobial therapy. Given the predominant T-lymphocyte dysfunction inherent to transplant immunosuppression, viral infections are a major contributor to morbidity resulting in graft dysfunction, graft rejection, systemic illness, and increased risk for other opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis and Aspergillus) and virally mediated cancers.",

As a result, transmission may occur from seronegative donors with active viral or other exposures (before seroconversion in the \u201cwindow period\u201d) or with viral loads below the limits of detection by the NAT selected.

Recent and remote exposures to endemic, geographically restricted systemic mycoses (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in localized pulmonary, systemic, or metastatic infection. Asymptomatic Strongyloides stercoralis infection may activate more than 30 years after initial exposure as a result of immunosuppressive therapy (see Fig. 31.1). Such reactivation can result in either a diarrheal illness and parasite migration with hyperinfection syndrome (characterized by hemorrhagic enterocolitis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, or both) or disseminated infection with accompanying (usually) gram-negative or polymicrobial bacteremia or meningitis. Gastroenteritis secondary to Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and a variety of enteric viruses (e.g., norovirus) can result in persistent infection, with more severe and prolonged diarrheal disease and an increased risk of primary or secondary bloodstream invasion and metastatic infection.20\n",

Fluid collections in this setting generally require drainage.2.Viral infections including CMV, HSV, VZV, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 or HHV-7, EBV, HBV, HCV, and HIV. Viruses are prominent given the importance of T cell function in antiviral control and the disproportionate degree of T cell inhibition by most immunosuppressive regimens. Furthermore, these viruses are systemically immunosuppressive, predisposing to opportunistic infection or acceleration of other infections and, via chronic immune stimulation, predispose to graft rejection. Useful therapies are now available for most of these pathogens. The herpesvirus infections are lifelong and tissue-associated, transmitted with the allograft from seropositive donors. Other common viral pathogens of this period include BK polyomavirus (in association with allograft dysfunction or polyomavirus-associated nephropathy [PyVAN]) and community-acquired respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, metapneumovirus).

A useful organ must be procured and implanted before some microbiologic assessments have been completed. Thus bacteremia or fungemia may not be detected until after transplantation has been performed. Such infections generally have not resulted in transmission of infection if the infection has been adequately treated before procurement using antimicrobial agents to which the organism is susceptible for an appropriate duration. In recipients of tissues from 95 bacteremic donors, a mean of 3.8 days of effective therapy after transplantation prevented transmission of susceptible pathogens (in an era of reduced antimicrobial resistance). Surveillance with additional courses of therapy in the recipient are employed, targeting known donor-derived pathogens.2, 35 Bacterial meningitis must be treated with antibiotics that penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid before organ procurement. Individuals with unidentified and untreated causes of meningoencephalitis or sepsis should not be used as organ donors. Donor-derived infections caused by Candida species have resulted from organ contamination or candidemia at the time of procurement.36, 37 Susceptibility testing of the isolate and prolonged treatment (2\u20134 weeks) with effective agents to avoid pyelonephritis, abscess formation, mycotic aneurysm, or candidemia in the recipient is recommended. Vascular involvement by Candida species in the recipient requires at least 6 weeks of therapy. Certain active infections (CMV, VZV, HSV, EBV, or HCV) may be unsuspected even in the seropositive donor and require NAT for diagnosis. Likewise, the donor\u2019s clinical, social, and medical histories are essential to reducing the risk of such infections. Known infection should be treated before procurement if possible.

Thus a bidirectional linkage exists between CMV replication and graft rejection.

Similarly, Lowance and colleagues have demonstrated that preventing CMV infection also resulted in a lower incidence of graft rejection.73, 78 The cellular and immunologic effects of CMV (\u201cindirect effects\u201d) are as important to the immunocompromised host as invasive viral infection.

The antigenemia assay is labor-intensive and, being semiquantitative, it is less commonly used than NAT; circulating neutrophils are immunostained for CMV early antigen (pp65) that is taken up nonspecifically as a measure of the total viral burden. QNAT is generally used for diagnosis, preemptive management strategies, and monitoring response to therapy.85, 86, 87, 88, 89 CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is generally detected earlier in whole blood compared with plasma; one specimen type and one laboratory should be used when monitoring patients. The highest viral loads often are associated with tissue-invasive disease; the lowest are associated with asymptomatic CMV infection. Multiple viral strains are often present during infection. Viral loads present during CMV syndrome vary widely. A single quantitative assay should be used consistently for monitoring each patient. A World Health Organization (WHO) International Reference Standard became available in 2010 from a clinical isolate (Merlin) with a titer of 5\u00d7106 IU/mL. All laboratory tests should be calibrated to the WHO International Standard with results reported as IU/mL.90 One source of variability is different DNA extraction methods. Multiple viral genotypes may be observed, often in patients with more severe disease and in antiviral resistance. Resistance testing should be performed in the face of poor clinical and virologic response to adequate therapy for at least 10 to 14 days; responses may be delayed with high-level viremia. Multiple risk factors for drug resistance often coexist, including prolonged antiviral drug exposure; notably with inadequate dosing, lack of immunity, high-level viral replication; and intensive immunosuppression.",

In the patient being treated for CMV infection, the assays provide an endpoint for therapy and the initiation of prophylaxis.",

In preemptive therapy, QNAT assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals (generally weekly for weeks 1\u201312) to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Preemptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care, while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of not only preventing CMV infection during the period of greatest risk but also diminishing infections secondary to HHV-6, HHV-7, and EBV. The indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, herpesvirus infections, opportunistic infections) also may be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither universal prophylaxis nor preemptive therapy is perfect. Many centers use a combination of both approaches: universal prophylaxis for the highest-risk recipients (D+/R\u2212 and R+ with T cell depletion) and preemptive therapy for others. Infrequently, breakthrough disease and ganciclovir resistance have been observed with both approaches.",

In symptomatic patients slow to respond to therapy and who are seronegative, the addition of CMV hyperimmune globulin (150 mg/kg/dose IV monthly) for 3 months is controversial, costly, and of uncertain benefit. Relapse does occur, primarily in seronegative patients, in those with high viral burdens, if not treated to the achievement of a negative quantitative assay, and in gastrointestinal disease treated with an oral regimen. Repeat endoscopy may be considered with poor clinical response, or if other processes are present (ischemia, cancer). In practice, it is reasonable to initiate therapy with intravenous ganciclovir, monitor weekly to assure a virologic response and treat until after monitoring is negative (often two negative weekly assays). Such patients may benefit from 2 to 4 months of oral valganciclovir (900 mg daily based on creatinine clearance) administered as secondary prophylaxis after the completion of intravenous therapy. This approach has resulted in rare symptomatic relapses and has been associated uncommonly with the emergence of antiviral resistance.

Clinically, the patient\u2019s viral load or clinical syndrome fails to respond to appropriate therapy, including a reduction in immunosuppression over 10 to 14 days. Genetic resistance testing is useful in managing resistant CMV infection. Many mutations have now been identified, including mutations in the viral UL97 (thymidine kinase) or UL54 (DNA polymerase) genes that confer ganciclovir resistance. Some of the common mutations in the UL97 gene respond to higher doses of intravenous ganciclovir. Combined mutations (UL97 and UL54) may manifest high-level resistance to ganciclovir. Alternative therapies have been available in intravenous form only. These include foscarnet and cidofovir. Foscarnet is active against many ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV, although associated with marked magnesium and potassium wasting, seizures (notably with calcineurin inhibitor therapy), and renal toxicity. Cidofovir may also be used, but often incurs significant nephrotoxicity and ocular toxicity. Viral polymerase UL54 mutations may cause resistance to foscarnet and cidofovir depending on the nature of the mutation. Multiple courses of antiviral therapy may be needed to cure resistant CMV infection. Given the toxicity of available medications, newer drugs are becoming available.",

BKV nephropathy is rarely recognized in recipients of extrarenal organs. The clinical presentation of disease is usually as asymptomatic, sterile pyuria, reflecting shedding of infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells. These cells contain sheets of virus and are detected by urine cytology as \u201cdecoy cells.\u201d In some cases, the patient presents with diminished renal allograft function or with ureteric stenosis and obstruction. In such patients, the etiologies of decreased renal function must be carefully evaluated (e.g., mechanical obstruction, drug toxicity, pyelonephritis, rejection, thrombosis, recurrent disease), and choices must be made between increasing immunosuppression to treat suspected graft rejection or reducing immunosuppression to allow the immune system to control infection.131, 132 Patients with BKV nephropathy treated with increased immunosuppression have a high incidence of graft loss. Reduced immunosuppression may stabilize renal allograft function but risks graft rejection. Other clinical syndromes may be associated with BKV, including pneumonitis, hemophagocytic syndrome, encephalitis, or PML.",

Soon after transplantation, CNS fungal infection is most often a result of Aspergillus; 1 year or later after transplantation, other fungi (Mucorales, dematiaceous fungi) become more prominent. The drug of choice for documented Aspergillus infection is voriconazole, despite its significant interactions with calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin.138, 139 Isavuconazole, an azole antifungal with activity against yeasts, Aspergillus, and some Mucorales, has been shown to be safe and efficacious in solid-organ transplant recipients although it may require dose adjustment and therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressive agents.140, 141, 142 Liposomal amphotericin is an effective and fungicidal alternative, though a more toxic alternative in renal transplantation and should be reserved for cases in which azoles are contraindicated or not tolerated. Although not as toxic as amphotericin B preparations, echinocandins can be used in situations where azole and polyene antifungals are contraindicated, but they are not recommended as primary therapy for invasive aspergillosis, including renal infections.
