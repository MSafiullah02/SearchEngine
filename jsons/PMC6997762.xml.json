            "text": "CoVs are enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA genomes. Their genomes are approximately 30 kb, encode structural proteins and accessory proteins, and contain two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins are processed into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) by multiple viral proteinase activities present in their sequences (2). Collectively, nsps form the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), which play a crucial role in the synthesis of viral RNA (5\u20139). Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies have revealed that CoV RTC proteins are localized on membrane networks composed of convoluted membranes and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are induced by the nsps themselves (7, 10\u201312). RTCs, together with recruited host factors, copy the genome either continuously into a genome-length template (i.e., replication) or discontinuously into the various subgenome-length minus-strand templates (i.e., transcription). These minus-strand templates are used for the synthesis of new molecules of genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) (2, 5). The sgmRNAs encode both CoV structural and accessory proteins. CoV particles are formed by at least four structural proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. While the M, E, and S proteins, together with membranes derived from host organelles, compose the virion envelope, the N protein binds the gRNA and allows its encapsulation into viral particles (13). Virions are formed by inward budding through the limiting membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and/or Golgi complex and reach the extracellular milieu through the secretory pathway (2, 3).",

The crystal structures of the N1b and N2b domains of the N proteins from SARS CoV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human CoV 229E, and MHV show similar overall topological organizations (15\u201320). The charged N2a domain, which contains a stretch of amino acids rich in serine and arginine residues, known as the SR-rich region, links N1b and N2b (14) (Fig. 1A). N proteins form dimers, which asymmetrically arrange themselves into octamers via their N2b domains and further assemble into larger oligomeric structures that acquire either a loose or more compact intertwined filament shape (19, 21, 22). This oligomerization occurs constitutively and might provide a larger binding surface for the optimal entangling of the large gRNA, as the multimerizing N2b domains form the core of the N protein filaments while the RNA-binding N1b domains decorate their surface (20, 23, 24). The resulting N protein-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes are finally incorporated into the forming viral particles through interactions with the C terminus of the M proteins (25).",

            "text": "CoV N protein plays a regulatory role in viral replication or transcription, a notion sustained by several studies showing that the N protein has RNA-binding and chaperone activities and promotes CoV gRNA replication (26\u201329). Phosphorylation of IBV, SARS CoV, and MHV N protein allows discrimination of binding of viral and nonviral mRNA (30, 31). The SR-rich region appears to be the CoV N protein domain that is mostly modified by phosphorylation (32, 33). Interestingly, it has been revealed that a priming phosphorylation of Ser205 of MHV N protein and of Ser189 and Ser207 of SARS CoV N protein, by a currently unknown kinase, triggers the subsequent phosphorylation of several residues of the SR-rich region by the host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (32). Phosphorylation by GSK-3 allows association of the RNA helicase DDX1 with N protein, which facilitates template read-through and enables the transition from discontinuous transcription of sgmRNAs to continuous synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and gRNA (32). Intriguingly, part of the N proteins localizes to RTCs, and this peculiar distribution is already observed at the early stages of infection (34\u201337). In contrast to most of the nsps, which appear to be static components of the RTCs (38), the N protein is dynamically associated with these structures, leading to the idea that it could be recruited to RTCs to stimulate synthesis and eventually to entangle gRNA (39). Interestingly, it has been shown that MHV N protein interacts with nsp3 (40, 41), one of the components of the RTCs, but it remains unclear whether this interaction is required for N protein recruitment to the RTCs. While cotransfection of N protein mRNA with MHV gRNA promotes viral replication, mRNAs encoding an N protein chimera that is not able to interact with nsp3 do not have the same proviral effect (40, 41). These observations indirectly indicate that N protein association with RTCs could have a relevant role in the CoV life cycle.",

The characterization of this interaction has allowed us to experimentally block it and thereby to determine its relevance for the CoV life cycle. We found that N protein indeed is recruited to the RTCs by interacting with nsp3. Using an in vitro binding approach, we showed that regions in the N1b and N2a domains of MHV N protein mediate the binding to nsp3 in a gRNA-independent manner. Importantly, we identified and created specific N protein point mutations that block its binding to nsp3 in vitro, and we found that this association is necessary for N protein recruitment and function at the RTCs in vivo. At the RTCs, the nsp3-mediation-recruited N protein is required for the stimulation of gRNA replication and sgmRNA transcription. Indeed, inhibition of the N protein-nsp3 interaction severely impairs viral replication and egression. Altogether, our data demonstrate that N protein interaction with nsp3 is a critical step for MHV replication, and its targeting could represent a valid anticoronaviral therapy.",

We initially determined which components of the RTCs interact with the N protein, particularly whether other nsps, apart from nsp3, also bind the N protein, by using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay (42). For this purpose, the N protein of MHV and all 16 nsps were cloned into a vector carrying the activation domain (AD) or the DNA binding domain (BD), respectively, of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor (42). Each plasmid encoding a BD-nsp fusion protein was transformed together with the one expressing the AD-N chimera into the Y2H test strain, and growth of the cotransformed cells on a medium lacking histidine was used to assess interaction. As shown in Fig. 1B, this approach revealed that MHV N protein bound mainly to nsp3, in agreement with the previous findings (40, 41, 43), and to a far lesser extent to nsp4. Since this potential interaction was detected in only one replicate, we did not investigate this further.",

In those studies, however, purified nsp3N was incubated with cell extracts from MHV-infected cells. As a result, this approach cannot exclude the possibility that N protein interacts indirectly with nsp3, i.e., via either a cellular protein or another viral protein, and thus a different factor could be involved in N protein recruitment to the RTCs. Therefore, we first examined whether the N protein and nsp3 bind directly, using in vitro binding experiments. The nsp3N fragment was fused to glutathione transferase (GST), expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified using glutathione (GSH) conjugated to Sepharose beads. To prove that our purified nsp3N fragment retained its overall conformation, GST or GST-nsp3N was first incubated with cell extracts obtained from noninfected and MHV-infected LR7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C and consistent with the literature (41), the N protein specifically bound to GST-nsp3N but not to GST alone. We also tested whether association with RNA was influencing N protein binding to nsp3N, because this parameter could be relevant for the follow-up in vitro studies with recombinant proteins. Therefore, cell extracts from infected cells were treated with RNase A or with this enzyme plus a specific RNase A inhibitor before being incubated with GST-nsp3N or GST. Importantly, removal of RNA did not alter N protein interaction with nps3N (Fig. 1C).",

We generated a series of C-terminal-truncated variants of the N protein and assessed their interactions with nsp3 using the Y2H system, to identify the nsp3-binding regions of the N protein (Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous reports (40, 41, 44), we pinpointed one binding region in the N2a domain, between amino acid 233 and amino acid 250, which contains the SR-rich region. To elaborate further on this, we generated three truncated forms, i.e., N1a-N1b/NTD (amino acids 1 to 194), N2a (amino acids 195 to 257), and N2b-N3/CTD (amino acids 258 to 454) (Fig. 1A). These truncated forms were fused with the 6\u00d7His tag and expressed in E. coli before preparation of bacterial cell extracts, which were then incubated with either GST or GST-nsp3N. As expected and as shown in Fig. 2B, none of the fusion proteins interacted with GST. In contrast, binding of GST-nsp3N with 6\u00d7His-N1a-N1b was detected, as suggested previously (45), but not with 6\u00d7His-N2a or 6\u00d7His-N2b-N3. Because interaction between nsp3 and N2a was reported previously (40, 41) and was shown to possess weak affinity (44), we repeated the pulldown experiments with GST-nps3N and 6\u00d7His-N2a and exposed the Western blot membranes for a longer time (Fig. 2C). This approach allowed detection of the binding between nps3N and N2a, in agreement with our Y2H analysis of the truncated N proteins (Fig. 2A). This result shows that motifs in two different regions of the N protein, i.e., N1a-N1b and to a much smaller extent N2a, are mediating its binding to nsp3.",

As highlighted in Fig. 3A, we found six stretches of amino acids that were both conserved and on the surface of the N1-N2a segment, thus making them available for interaction. Four of these amino acid stretches were localized in the N1 region and two in the N2a fragment. We changed the conserved polar and charged amino acids to alanines and the conserved nonpolar amino acids to aspartates in each one of these different sequences, creating mutated versions of the 6\u00d7His-tagged N protein truncated forms, i.e., N2am1 (amino acids 195 to 257, with L240E, V241E, and L242E substitutions), N2am2 (amino acids 195 to 257, with S197A, R202A, S203A, and S205A substitutions), N1m3 (amino acids 1 to 194, with T73A, Q74A, and K77A substitutions), N1m4 (amino acids 1 to 194, with K101A, Y103A, and W104A substitutions), N1m5 (amino acids 1 to 194, with R109A, R110A, and K113A substitutions), and N1m6 (amino acids 1 to 194, with F128A, Y129A, Y130A, and T133A substitutions) (Fig. 3A). Of note, the S205A change in the N2am2 variant alters the priming site that is essential for SR-rich region phosphorylation by host cell GSK-3 (32, 46). Cell extracts obtained from E. coli strains expressing these constructs were incubated with either GST or GST-nsp3N. Although N1m3 and N1m5 bound GST-nsp3N with the same affinity as wild-type N1, we found that the other mutated truncated forms displayed strong reductions in interaction with GST-nsp3N (Fig. 3B). We concluded that amino acids at positions 101 to 104 and 129 to 133 and at positions 194 to 202 and 240 to 242 play roles in the interaction of nsp3 with N1 and N2a, respectively (Fig. 3B). This result also revealed that the SR-rich region that is phosphorylated in vivo is not important for N protein binding to nsp3.",

In the first, the two identified nsp3 BDs act cooperatively, and disruption of one of them is sufficient to abolish the nsp3-N protein interaction. In the second, the two identified nsp3 BDs are redundant, and mutation of only one of them does not affect the association between nsp3 and N protein. Thus, to determine whether the single mutations in N1 or N2a are sufficient to block the N1-N2a interaction with nsp3N, we expressed the N1-N2am1, N1-N2am2, N1-N2am4, and N1-N2am6 variants in E. coli before incubation of bacterial extracts with either GST or GST-nsp3N. As shown in Fig. 3C, all constructs specifically bound GST-nsp3N with the same affinity as wild-type N1-N2a. This finding showed that the binding of MHV N protein to nsp3 is not mediated by a single domain and thus the domains might be redundant in the binding function, as contemplated in the second scenario.",

To investigate whether the mutated N proteins that showed reduced nsp3 binding, i.e., Nm4m1 and Nm6m1 (Fig. 4A), had a defect in self-interaction, we analyzed their self-binding.

Wild-type N protein was detected mainly in fractions 4 to 6, as expected (Fig. 4D) (23). The distribution of the Nm4m1 oligomer over the gradient differed slightly, compared to that of the wild-type oligomer, i.e., the signal was present mainly in fractions 6 and 7, suggesting that the protein assembled predominately in larger oligomers. Importantly, the oligomerization of the Nm6m1 variant was similar to that of the N protein, as the oligomer was detected mainly in fractions 4 to 7 (Fig. 4C and D).

First, we opted to generate recombinant MHV expressing an additional copy of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged N or Nm6m1 by inserting the coding sequences of these two fusion proteins into the viral locus of the nonessential hemagglutinin esterase gene (39). The Nm6m1 mutant was chosen because it oligomerizes similarly to the wild-type N protein (Fig. 4D). We tried three times to generate an MHV-Nm6m1-GFP chimeric strain using this approach but, although we obtained the control MHV-N-GFP strain each time, we were unable to recover the mutant virus. Second, we turned to a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics system to introduce the Nm6m1 mutation in the viral N locus (47). With this approach as well, the wild-type strain but not the mutant strain was obtained in two attempts. Because genomic expression of Nm6m1 appeared to be lethal for the virus, we decided to opt for a different strategy. We expressed mCherry, mCherry-N, or mCherry-Nm6m1 fusion proteins in mouse LR7 cells before exposing the cells to MHV. mCherry, mCherry-N, and mCherry-Nm6m1 were homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm in noninfected cells (data not shown). In contrast, MHV-infected cells displayed numerous distinct cytoplasmic puncta that were positive for both nsp2 and nsp3 (data not shown); these puncta were previously shown to represent RTCs (39). Interestingly, wild-type mCherry-N but not mCherry-Nm6m1 or mCherry alone was recruited to these nsp2/nsp3-positive RTCs (data not shown).",

Therefore, we decided to turn to the human HeLa-CEACAM1a cell line, which expresses the MHV cell receptor CEACAM1a and is highly transfectable (48). As expected, the GFP, GFP-N, and GFP-Nm6m1 constructs were efficiently transfected into HeLa-CEACAM1a cells, with around 80% of the cells displaying the fluorescent signal. In agreement with the results obtained with LR7 cells, GFP, GFP-N, and GFP-Nm6m1 fusion proteins were homogenously distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A) and MHV infection caused a redistribution of GFP-N to the nsp2/nsp3-positive RTCs (Fig. 5A, fifth row). This observation confirmed that ectopically expressed GFP-tagged N protein behaved like the protein encoded by the viral gRNA over the course of an infection. Surprisingly, we found that a large number of cells expressing GFP-Nm6m1 did not display nsp2/nsp3-positive RTCs (Fig. 5B), indicating that this construct has a dominant negative effect on viral replication. In a very few cases (approximately 4% of the cells expressing GFP-Nm6m1), RTCs were present in the same number and had a similar size as in cells expressing GFP-N (data not shown) but GFP-Nm6m1 was not recruited onto the RTCs (Fig. 5A and C). Altogether, these results show that N protein binding to nsp3 is required for its recruitment to the RTCs and possibly also for MHV RNA synthesis and replication.",

We took advantage of the MHV-2aFLS strain, which carries the genes encoding firefly luciferase and allows assessment of viral replication by monitoring the activity of this enzyme (49). We transfected the plasmids expressing GFP, GFP-N, or GFP-Nm6m1 fusion protein into HeLa-CEACAM1a cells for 48 h before exposing the cells to different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of MHV-2aFLS, i.e., MOIs of 2.5, 5, and 10, and measuring luciferase activity at 7 h postinfection (p.i.). As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of wild-type N protein promoted viral replication over time after exposure to different amounts of virus, as expected (26\u201329). Very interestingly, there was a significant decrease in luciferase expression in cells transfected with GFP-Nm6m1, compared to those expressing GFP-N as well as those expressing GFP alone, showing that GFP-Nm6m1 cannot promote viral replication like the wild-type protein; on the contrary, it has a dominant negative effect. Using the same approach, we explored whether the presence of Nm6m1 had a permanent negative effect on viral replication or was just retarding it. For this purpose, cells transfected with the various constructs were infected with MHV-2aFLS at a MOI of 5 and luciferase activity was measured at 5, 7, and 9 h p.i. (Fig. 6B and data not shown). In this experiment as well, the GFP-N chimera stimulated replication over time and at all the examined time points, while GFP-Nm6m1 had a pronounced inhibitory effect on MHV replication.",

An advantage of in vitro assays is that proteins and other components can be easily added, to determine their effects on viral RNA synthesis. First, osmotically lysed MHV-infected cells were centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g to separate dense membranes containing RTCs (13,000 \u00d7 g pellet [P13]) from the cytosol (13,000 \u00d7 g supernatant [S13]). As expected, the ER integral membrane protein VAP-A was found entirely in the P13 fraction, while cytoplasmic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was found mainly in the S13 fraction (Fig. 7B). To confirm the enrichment of RTCs in the P13 fraction, we probed the samples with anti-N antibodies and, as expected (50), RTCs were exclusively detected in the P13 fraction. Next, we tested the best experimental conditions for detection of RNA synthesis by MHV RTCs in vitro. Similar to the protocol established for SARS CoV (50), the P13 fractions from MHV-infected and noninfected cells were mixed with nucleoside triphosphates, an ATP-regenerating system, and actinomycin D, a potent inhibitor of host cellular transcription. To assess the synthesis of both sgmRNA and gRNA, we employed quantitative RT-PCR instead of labeling using radioactive nucleoside triphosphates (50). The IVRS assays showed that viral RNA was more effectively synthesized when the P13 fraction from MHV-infected cells (P13-MHV) was present in the reaction mixtures (Fig. 7C). Since it was shown that host factors that are present in the S13 fraction are required for viral RNA synthesis in vitro (50), we added S13 from infected cells and compared the viral RNA synthesis rate with that of samples not containing S13 (Fig. 7C, column 2 versus column 3). Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of viral RNA synthesis in the presence of S13 from infected cells, indicating that the P13 fraction was sufficient to sustain IVRS (Fig. 7C). Subsequently we explored whether adding different amounts of N protein to the IVRS assay enhanced viral transcription. As shown in Fig. 7D, we found that 1 \u03bcg of protein extract from N protein-expressing bacteria provided the maximal stimulation of MHV RTC-mediated viral RNA synthesis. Smaller amounts of the bacterial extracts had less pronounced effects, while larger amounts had an inhibitory impact.",

            "text": "A few approaches have shown that nsp3 interacts with the N protein, but the molecular details of the binding between these two proteins remained to be clarified because of inconsistent conclusions. Hurst and colleagues exploited genetic approaches both to identify nsp3 as a binding partner of MHV N protein and to show that the cytoplasmic N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3 and the SR-rich region of the N2a domain of the N protein may be important for this interaction (40, 41). They also provided in vitro evidence that N protein association with RNA is not relevant for its interaction with the N terminus of nsp3 (40, 41). A solution study using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry found that the N1b-N2a fragment, but not N1b and N2a individually, bound nsp3 with high affinity (44). Consistent with the other studies, this result indicates that at least one nsp3-binding determinant is localized to the SR-rich-region-containing N2a domain of the N protein (40, 41). This domain alone, however, is not sufficient to maintain high-affinity binding to nsp3, which suggests the presence of one or more interaction domains in the N1b-N2a fragment (44). Using in silico modeling, it was recently concluded that two regions in the N1b domain of MHV N protein, containing the residues Lys113, Arg125, and Tyr127 and the residues Glu173 and Tyr190, are involved in N protein-nsp3 association (45). Our detailed examination of the association between purified nsp3N and different N variants using in vitro pulldown experiments confirms the previous observations, because it demonstrates that indeed both N1b and N2a interact with nsp3N, with N1b having stronger binding affinity than N2a (Fig. 2). In particular, we found that, when concomitantly mutated, two sets of amino acids in N1b (K101/Y103/W104 and F128/Y129/Y130/T133) and two in N2a (S197/R202/S203/S205A and L240/V241/L242) led to a defect in the interaction of these domains with nsp3N. Interestingly, a single set of substitutions in either the N1b or N2a region did not yield a major defect in the association between the N1-N2a fragment and nsp3N (Fig. 3C), indicating a redundancy in the binding of the two protein domains. In agreement with this notion, the combination of substitutions in the N1b and N2a regions completely blocked the interaction between full-length MHV N and nsp3N (Fig. 4A).",

Cotransfection of MHV N protein mRNA and gRNA led to a significant increase in infectivity, compared to transfection with gRNA alone (41). A similar beneficial role of N protein for infection has been shown for other CoVs as well (26, 27). Despite these observations, the mechanism of how CoV N proteins stimulate CoV infections has remained unknown. To the best of our knowledge, our data are the first to reveal that the direct association of N protein with RTCs is a critical step for MHV infection, because the impairment of this interaction had negative effects on MHV replication and progeny production (Fig. 5 and 6). This notion is also indirectly supported by the fact that it was not possible to generate MHV mutant strains expressing Nm6m1, using two distinct approaches. In particular, we found that Nm6m1 expression in host cells has a dominant negative effect on the MHV life cycle. Our interpretation of this result is that ectopically expressed Nm6m1 outcompetes the virus-encoded N protein, especially early during infection, when the first RTCs are formed. This leads to the formation of N protein oligomers that are principally composed of Nm6m1 and thus are unable to be effectively recruited to RTCs. Furthermore, we show that wild-type N protein that is correctly recruited to RTCs promotes local viral RNA synthesis, i.e., gRNA replication and sgmRNA transcription, in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 7 and data not shown). In contrast, the nsp3-binding mutant Nm6m1 is not able to do so. This finding reveals that N protein recruitment to and association with RTCs are critical for the optimal functioning of these complexes in viral RNA synthesis and ultimately infection.",

As a result, a speculative idea is that phosphorylation of the SR-rich region, which is part of the N2a domain, triggers recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 (32) but also abrogates one of the interactions between the N protein and nsp3. The latter event could help to accommodate the RNA helicase DDX1 in the N protein-RTC complexes and/or to promote the transition into the transcription mode by influencing the ultrastructural organization of the N protein-RTC complexes.",

It remains unclear, however, how and why the N protein orchestrates viral RNA synthesis. A speculative idea is that the N protein-nsp3 interaction induces enzymatic activities and/or provides a more structured conformation of the complexes, positively influencing protein-RNA interactions at the RTCs. This could guarantee sufficient production of structural proteins necessary to efficiently encapsulate the newly formed ribonucleoprotein complexes into virions. Our current working model is that N proteins probably oligomerize in the cytosol and then are recruited to RTCs, which are present at the DMVs and convoluted membranes, through the binding to nsp3 (Fig. 8). At the RTCs, the N oligomers stimulate viral RNA synthesis. While local production of gRNA and the presence of N oligomers may promote the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, newly transcribed sgmRNA would guarantee sufficient synthesis of structural proteins. In contrast, Nm6m1-containing oligomers cannot be efficiently recruited to the RTCs, and viral RNA synthesis fails to be stimulated (Fig. 8), resulting in strongly impaired CoV infection.",

The sequences coding for either full-length MHV N protein or truncated forms, i.e., N1 (amino acids 1 to 194), N2a (amino acids 195 to 257), and N2b-N3 (amino acids 258 to 454), were amplified from MHV cDNA by PCR and cloned into the pET32c vector (EMD Millipore, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using BamHI and XhoI, creating the pET32c-N, pET32C-N1, pET32C-N2a, and pET32C-N2b-N3 plasmids, which express the 6\u00d7His-N, 6\u00d7His-N1, 6\u00d7His-N2a, and 6\u00d7His-N2b-N3 fusion proteins, respectively. The sequence coding for MHV nsp3N was amplified from MHV cDNA by PCR and cloned into the pGEX vector (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) using BamHI and XhoI, creating the pGEX-nsp3N construct, which expresses the GST-nsp3N chimera. The mutated N proteins were created from the pET32c-N construct by PCR, which generated the pET32c-N2am1 (amino acids 195 to 257, carrying the L240E, V241E, and L242E substitutions), pET32c-N2am2 (amino acids 195 to 257, carrying the S197A, R202A, S203A, and S205A substitutions), pET32c-N1m3 (amino acids 1 to 194, carrying the T73A, Q74A, and K77A substitutions), pET32c-N1m4 (amino acids 1 to 194, carrying the K101A, Y103A, and W104A substitutions), pET32c-N1m5 (amino acids 1 to 194, carrying the R109A, R110A, and K113A substitutions), pET32c-N1m6 (amino acids 1 to 194, carrying the F128A, Y129A, Y130A, and T133A substitutions), pET32c-Nm4m1 (amino acids 1 to 454, carrying the L240E, V241E, L242E, K101A, Y103A, and W104A substitutions), pET32c-Nm6m1 (amino acids 1 to 454, carrying the L240E, V241E, L242E, F128A, Y129A, Y130A, and T133A substitutions), pET32c-Nm4m2 (amino acids 1 to 454, carrying the S197A, R202A, S203A, S205A, K101A, Y103A, and W104A substitutions), and pET32c-Nm6m2 (amino acids 1 to 454, carrying the S197A, R202A, S203A, S205A, F128A, Y129A, Y130A, and T133A substitutions) plasmids (Fig. 1A and 3A). To express mCherry-tagged versions of the different N protein mutants in cells, the GFP coding sequence in the pcDNA5-GFP vector was replaced with the mCherry sequence, using StrI and BsrGI, to create pcDNA5-mCherry. PCR-generated N, Nm4m1, Nm6m1, Nm4m2, and Nm6m2 sequences were subsequently inserted into pcDNA5-mCherry as HindIII-BamHI fragments, generating pcDNA5-mCherry-N, pcDNA5-mCherry-Nm4m1, pcDNA5-mCherry-Nm6m1, pcDNA5-mCherry-Nm4m2, and pcDNA5-mCherry-Nm6m2, respectively. To express GFP-tagged versions of the mutant N proteins in cells, GFP was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector as a XhoI-BamHI fragment, creating pcDNA3.1-GFP. PCR-generated N, Nm4m1, Nm6m1, Nm4m2, and Nm6m2 were subsequently inserted into pcDNA3.1-GFP as BamHI-HindIII fragments, generating pcDNA3.1-GFP-N, pcDNA3.1-GFP-Nm4m1, pcDNA3.1-GFP-Nm6m1, pcDNA3.1-GFP-Nm4m2, and pcDNA3.1-GFP-Nm6m2, respectively.
