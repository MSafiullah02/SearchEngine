            "text": "In epidemiology, the fundamental concept of infectious disease is the investigation of how infections spread. Mathematical methods, such as the class of susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models (Allen et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2020; Lawson et al., 2016; Pfeiffer et al., 2008; Wakefield et al., 2019; Weiss, 2013) , are widely used in epidemics to capture the dynamic process of the spread of the infectious disease. However, pure mathematical modeling is deterministic, and only demonstrates the average behavior of the epidemic. In addition, its focus is often on the form of models, not the parameter estimation for observed data; thus, it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty. Instead, statistical models provide a varying characterization of different types of errors. When it comes to analyzing the reported numbers of infectious diseases, other factors may also be responsible for temporal or spatial patterns. The spread of the disease varies a lot across different geographical regions. Local area features, like socioeconomic factors and demographic conditions, can dramatically influence the course of the epidemic. These data are usually supplemented with the population information at the county level. In addition, the capacity of the health care system, and control measures, such as governmentmandated social distancing, also have a significant impact on the spread of the epidemic. SIR models with assumptions of random mixing can overestimate the health service needed by not taking into account the behavioral change and government-mandated action. In this paper, we propose a class of novel nonparametric dynamic epidemic models to analyze the infectious disease data by incorporating the spatiotemporal structure and the effect of explanatory variables.",

Because there are more uninsured people in the urban area, an increasing pattern is observed in the urban rate impact analysis. \"PD\" is often considered to have a linear relationship with COVID-19 infection cases in most studies and news reports. Our results are consistent with the intuition. The higher the \"PD\" is, the higher the logarithm of new COVID-19 cases is. The local healthcare expenditure, \"EHPC\", has a similar impact on COVID-19 infections. The elderly population's impact pattern is an inverse U-shape. This pattern is because they are easier to be infected. However, when the older population dominates the community, people are less active and more risk-averse, thus stay home more often, so that it hinders the spread of the virus.",
