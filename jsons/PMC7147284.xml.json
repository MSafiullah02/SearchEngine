All the patients were scanned in a supine position during breath-holding at full inspiration. All CT images were evaluated using a lung window, with a window level of \u2212500 HU and window width of 1500 HU. Two certificated chest radiologists with 10 and 8 years' experience independently reviewed the CT images while they were blinded to the names and clinical data of the patients. The CT imaging features were fully assessed, and the following findings were highlighted: ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening, subpleural line, lymph node enlargement, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion in accordance with the standard morphologic descriptors based on the Fleischner Society Nomenclature Committee recommendations and similar studies.7,8 As a rule, a consensus had to be reached between the 2 radiologists about the abnormalities, and discrepancies were reconciled and tackled via discussion. Specifically, the evaluation of the size and extent of lung involvement was based on the segments of the lung anatomy: 10 segments in the right lung and 10 segments in the left lung (2 segments were considered in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe and 2 segments were considered in the inferior front segment of the left lower lobe). According to the evaluation criterion established by Chongqing Radiologist Association of China, the pulmonary inflammation index (PII) was obtained from each patient. PII = (distribution score + size score)/40 \u00d7 100% (Fig. 1). Distribution score: scored according to the lesion distribution, one score for each lung segment, and 20 scores for left and right lung. Lesion size was scored according to whether the lesion occupied more than 50% of the lung segment volume, one score for \u226550%, and zero score for <50%. Spearman correlations were performed to evaluate the relationships between the PII value and the clinical symptom and laboratory results of the patients. All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 23.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

In chest CT images, 76 (95%) of 80 cases of the patients had abnormalities indicating the pneumonia. The major CT abnormalities observed were GGO (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%) (Fig. 1). Besides that, 9 (11%) of 80 patients had bronchial wall thickening, 16 (20%) of 80 patients had subpleural line, 5 (6%) of 80 patients had pleural effusion, 3 (4%) of 80 patients had lymph node enlargement, and 4 (5%) of 80 patients had pericardial effusion. The characteristic signs were \u201ccrazy paving sign\u201d (23/80, 29%) and \u201cspider web sign\u201d (20/80, 25%) (Figs. 2, 3). The \u201ccrazy paving pattern\u201d was characterized by the reticular interlobular septa thickening within the patchy GGO, which had been reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) literatures.9,10 The \u201cspider web sign\u201d was the first time we found and named it. It showed a triangular or angular GGO under the pleura with the internal interlobular septa thickened like a net. The adjacent pleura were pulled and formed a spider web\u2013like shape in the corner. Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 \u00b1 6 lung segments involved. The lesions showed subpleural distribution in 42 (53%) of 80 cases, diffuse distribution in 7 (9%) of 80 cases, peribronchial distribution in 3 (4%) of 80 cases, and mixed distribution in 24 (30%) of 80 cases. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average PII value was (34% \u00b1 20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (continuous variable) (P < 0.05). The correlation coefficient values were \u22120.260, \u22120.258, 0.373, 0.273, 0.287, and 0.544, respectively. The chest CT findings of the patients were shown in Table 3.",

Whether the novel coronavirus can spread in other ways is unclear, although it could be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory secretions, blood, feces, and other samples. Early identification and early intervention are vital to reduce the incidence and mortality of severe cases. In this study, most patients were adults, and there was no significant difference between the numbers of either male or female. Cough and fever were the most common clinical symptoms. The incidence of expectoration, chest pain, muscle ache, abdominal pain or diarrhea, pharyngeal discomfort, headache or dizziness, and dyspnea were less common. This is similar to other types of coronavirus infections such as the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).11\u201313 This implies that they can presumably be classified as the same kind of infection and the target cells of SARS-CoV-2 may also be located in the lower respiratory tract.",

            "text": "For chest CT, 76 cases (95%) had abnormalities indicating the pneumonia. On the whole, in comparison with other types of pneumonia, COVID-19 seemed to cause milder symptoms and severer pulmonary changes on CT. Most of the patients had mild symptoms and mild temperature rise, but their lung manifestations were serious. Multiple lesions were found in multiple segments and lobes of both lungs, which was different from the bacterial pneumonia. In other words, multiple and large lesions of 2 lungs involved simultaneously is not generally spotted in the typical bacterial pneumonia.14,15 The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe, the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe, the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe, and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe. There were significant correlations among the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. Our results suggested that chest CT could be used to evaluate the severity of the disease and played an important role in clinical practice. For CT features, GGO was the most common of all the abnormalities, followed by consolidation and interlobular septal thickening. This is consistent with the results of the recently published studies.16\u201318 Occasionally, the subpleural line and bronchial wall thickening could be seen, whereas pleura effusion, pericardial effusion, or lymph node enlargement were rare to identify. Some of the GGO was characterized by the reticular interlobular septa thickening, which was called \u201ccrazy paving pattern.\u201d It resulted from the alveolar edema and interstitial inflammatory of acute lung injury, which had been reported in SARS.9,10 In another situation, some of the GGO showed a triangular or angular shape under the pleura with the internal interlobular septa thickened like a net. The adjacent pleura were pulled and formed a spider web\u2013like shape in the corner. Thus, we named it \u201cspider web sign.\u201d However, the pathological basis needs further pathological confirmation. It is a specific sign for COVID-19, which has not been reported in other diseases in the literature. At present, it is not clear whether it has clinical value in evaluating the prognosis of patients. Recently, Pan et al have analyzed the time course of lung changes in 21 mild patients with confirmed COVID-19. They found that the initial lung manifestation was subpleural GGO, which turned to consolidation 2 weeks after the onset of the disease, and then the lesions were gradually absorbed, leaving a wide range of GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands.17 In another article, the authors found that after 7 days of treatment for the mild patients, there was a significant reduction in GGO on chest CT. On the 13th day after admission, most of the ground glass disappeared. Our patients constituted a complete group with mild, severe, and critical types.19 All patients completed CT examination within 2 days after admission, which was 7 \u00b1 4 days from the onset of the disease.",

The ground glass density lesions could be caused by the exudation of alveoli. The appearance of consolidation indicated that the alveoli were completely filled by inflammatory exudation. The thickening of interlobular septum indicated that the pulmonary interstitium has been involved. In the late stage of acute respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar, and interstitium damage may occur.",

There were significant correlations among the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. Computed tomography played an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency. Nevertheless, this study has 3 limitations. First of all, this was a retrospective study involving a small number of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, none of the patients had a lung biopsy or autopsy to reflect the histopathological changes. Third, this study was a cross-sectional study, and we could not analyze the dynamic CT changes in different stages. In the future work, we will investigate the chest CT features of differential stages of COVID-19 by using larger, more diverse samples.",
