Analysis of the complete genome sequences suggested that these newly identified HRV genotypes belonged to a potentially novel HRV species, HRV-C, with genome features distinct from HRV-A and HRV-B [22, 24] . Subsequently, HRVs closely related to HRV-C were also identified in more clinical samples worldwide, especially in those obtained from children with respiratory illness [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, most of these studies only focused on the molecular identification of HRV-C from clinical samples. No systematic study has been carried out to examine the epidemiology and clinical features of HRV-C, compared with those of HRV-A and HRV-B. In particular, the importance of HRV-C in adult respiratory illness still remains poorly understood. In this study, we describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV-C in hospitalized children and adults during a 1-year period. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of HRV-C infection were also compared with those of HRV-A and HRV-B infection.",

In particular, 33 (42%) of the 78 children with HRV-C infection experienced asthmatic exacerbations or febrile wheeze. Acute otitis media and croup each occurred in 1 child with HRV-C infection. Although our study included only NPA samples with negative results for common respiratory viruses, respiratory bacterial coinfecting pathogens were occasionally observed.

            "text": "We report the first clinical and molecular epidemiology study of HRV-C infection in comparison to HRV-A and HRV-B infection in both children and adults. Because laboratory diagnosis of HRV infection is generally not available in clinical virology laboratories, their impact on health is often ignored. Although recent reports have implicated HRVs in more severe URTIs and lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised adults [12] [13] [14] , the relative importance and disease severity associated with the 2 pre-existing species, HRV-A and HRV-B, and the newly described species, HRV-C, are not well understood. In this study, HRVs, especially HRV-A and HRV-C, are shown to be important causes of hospitalizations due to respiratory illness in our locality. In other studies that described the detection of HRV-A and HRV-B in addition to the new genotypes, the results were often limited by either the small number of samples with positive results or a lack of clinical and epidemiological data [20, 23, 27, 28, 32] . In our previous study, HRVs were detected in 26 (12.8%) of 203 NPA samples obtained from hospitalized children, among which 21 were HRV-C and 5 were HRV-A viruses [22] . In this study, 18.3% of the tested NPA samples had positive results for HRV, with HRV-A being the most prevalent species (111 isolates), followed by HRV-C (91 isolates) and HRV-B (18 isolates). These results suggest that HRV-A and HRV-C may be more prevalent than HRV-B in our population or that they are associated with higher hospitalization rates. Interestingly, HRV-A and HRV-C appeared to alternate as the most common HRV species at different times during the peak seasons ( Figure 1 ). Alternate disease activity has been reported in human parainfluenza virus infection, where human parainfluenza virus 3 activity also appeared to be greater during years when human parainfluenza virus 1 was not circulating, a phenomenon believed to be attributable to viral interference or cross-serological protection [31] . It would be interesting to investigate possible viral interference between HRV-A and HRV-C.",

For 1 infant, staff members from the same baby care center were noted to have similar illness. These suggest that HRV-C frequently circulates among institutions. On the other hand, clusters of cases due to the same strains of HRV-C and frequent reports of contacts with similar illness were also observed in the community-ac-quired cases, suggesting that these viruses are also common causes of community outbreaks that lead to significant morbidity and hospital admissions.

Although the detection rate of HRV-C infection was higher among children in the present study, adults with HRV-C infection appeared to present with more-severe illness. HRV-C infection has been mostly described in infants and young children with acute respiratory illness. In line with our results reported elsewhere [22] , children with HRV-C infection in the present study commonly present with URTI, febrile wheeze, and asthmatic exacerbations. One child also presented with acute otitis media, which concurred with the detection of HRV-C in middle ear fluid samples from patients with acute otitis media in another report [25] . On the other hand, relatively little is known about the significance of HRV-C infection in the adult population. In a study from Australia, 2 of the 17 identified strains were from adults, of whom 1 experienced an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [21] . In 2 other studies that mentioned the detection of novel HRVs, which corresponded to HRV-C, in respiratory tract samples from adults, no further clinical details were provided [23, 28] . In the present study, 8 (62%) of the 13 adults with HRV-C infection had pneumonia, compared with 6 (27%) of the 22 adults with HRV-A infection ( ) P ! .05 (Table 2) . Although most of the adults with HRV-C infection had underlying diseases or were of advanced age, 1 of the 8 patients with pneumonia was a 45-year-old healthy man who presented with left upper lobe consolidation without identifiable coinfecting pathogens. Among the 16 cases of HRV-C-associated pneumonia, 6 were caused by viruses of 3 different clusters (2 closely related strains from each cluster), respectively ( Figure 2 ). Wheezing episodes were also more common in patients with HRV-C (37%) and HRV-A (20%) infection, compared with that in patients with HRV-B (0%) infection (P ! ). Although children with HRV-C infection most often pre-.05 sented with URTI, the disease course was not uncommonly complicated by asthmatic exacerbations or febrile wheeze triggered by the virus infection. Further clinical studies that involve more patients with HRV infection are required to investigate whether certain HRV species or strains may be more virulent than others.",

This may be attributable to low cross-serological protection between different strains of HRV-C and between different HRV species, especially in the setting of a suboptimal level of neutralizing antibodies from previous infection in patients with underlying diseases. Together with the genetic diversity observed in VP4 sequence analysis throughout the year, HRV-C probably represents a clade of diverse HRV genotypes that can easily evade immune protection. However, successful isolation of different HRV-C genotypes would be required to study their cross-serological reactivity.",

            "text": "HRV-C has been proposed as a new HRV species within the genus Enterovirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/p/1035.aspx), which may contain a distinct subgroup of strains. Since the discovery of this new clade of HRV, related viruses have been identified from different countries from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] 32] . Although these viruses were referred to as novel genotypes or HRV-X in some studies, they are now believed to represent a distinct species, HRV-C [22, 24-26, 28, 32, 33] . First, these viruses formed a distinct cluster separate from HRV-A and HRV-B on phylogenetic analysis of the 5 noncoding regions and predicted proteins [22, 24] . Second, they possessed genome features distinct from HRV-A and HRV-B, namely, a different putative cleavage site between VP4 and VP2 and major differences within the VP1 region. In particular, only a few of the conserved amino acid residues within VP1 that determine receptor binding of HRV-A and HRV-B were found [22] . With use of structural homology modeling, the VP1 of HRV-C was also found to possess structural disparities within sites for receptor binding, compared with HRV-A and HRV-B [24] . These suggested that HRV-C may use a different cellular receptor, which may reflect the inability to successfully isolate HRV-C in traditional cell cultures. By completing the genome sequences for all known HRV serotypes, a recent study also confirmed species-specific sequence and RNA structure elements that differentiate HRV-A and HRV-B from HRV-C [33] . The study also identified a potential novel clade, clade D, which forms a separate cluster within HRV-A. Interestingly, we also identified a potential distinct cluster of strains of HRV-C during phylogenetic analysis in the present study. In fact, we found that a similar separate cluster of strains was also present in our and several other studies of HRV-C strains, although bootstrap values were not shown in some studies [20, 22, 25, 27, 28] . When all available VP4 sequences of HRV-C isolates were included in analysis, these strains were clustered with high bootstrap values, suggesting a possible distinct subgroup within HRV-C (analysis was performed using available sequences published up to 15 March 2009; data not shown). The same tree topology was obtained when a different method, UPGMA, was used for tree construction (data not shown). However, the present data are limited by the fact that only VP4 sequences were available for analysis. Although additional studies are required to elucidate the receptor(s) for HRV-C, the existing data support the clas-sification of HRV-C as a separate species. Longer gene sequences or complete genome sequences of the diverse HRV-C genotypes should allow better delineation of their genetic variability and allow ascertainment of the existence of distinct subgroups within the species.",

Strains detected from adults are marked with asterisks. Strains associated with pneumonia are marked with arrows. The 5 strains with the same nucleotide differences detected from 5 patients within 3 days are shaded. The 6 strains of 3 different clusters (2 closely related strains from each cluster) associated with pneumonia are marked with a plus sign. The scale bar indicates the estimated number of substitutions per 50 bases. The HRV-QPM strain was from Queensland. The GenBank accession numbers of the previously published sequences are as follows: HRV-QPM, EF186077; HRV89, A10937; HRV14, NC_001490; HRV-C 024, NC_009996; HRV-C 025, EF582386; and HRV-C 026, EF582387.",
