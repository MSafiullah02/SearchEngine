It is defined as a lymphoid proliferation or lymphoma that develops as a consequence of immunosuppression in a recipient of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant. The immunosuppression required to preserve graft function post-transplant leads to an impairment of T-cell immunity. This allows an uncontrolled proliferation of EBV-infected B cells. This results in monoclonal or polyclonal plasmacytic hyperplasia, B-cell hyperplasia, B-cell lymphoma or immunoblastic lymphoma. Immune surveillance is impaired; the balance between latently infected B-cell proliferation and the EBV-specific T-cell response is disrupted and leads to the infected B cells developing into PTLD (Heslop 2009).",

Alcohol hand rubs or gels are not effective against Clostridium difficile spores.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)Wear gloves and apron before entering the patient\u2019s room.Remove apron and gloves before leaving the patient\u2019s room.Hands must be decontaminated before putting on and after removing gloves.Ensure that all healthcare workers and visitors wear and dispose of PPE appropriately.\nWaste and LinenAny clinical waste and linen, including bedding and, if present, curtains, should be considered contaminated and managed properly.\nMovement of PatientsPatients with CD should not be transferred to other wards in the hospital, except for isolation purposes or if they require specialist care on another ward.When patients need to attend departments for essential investigations, the nurse looking after the patient is responsible for informing the receiving area in advance of the patient\u2019s CD-positive status; if possible, symptomatic patients should be seen at the end of the working session and should be sent for only when the department is ready to see them; it should be avoided to leave them in a waiting area with other patients.\n",

The ventilation system should ensure at least 12 air changes per hour; a direct flow area of the room must have the way out on the opposite side with respect to that of entry. The optimum ambient air quality can be obtained without using the expensive laminar flow. The rooms, housing highly immunocompromised patients, need to be placed under positive pressure to prevent the entry into the room of airborne pathogens in the hallway or in adjacent spaces. In the rooms it is forbidden to keep fresh flowers and/or dried and potted plants (Tomblyn et al. 2010). Although it is unlikely that exposure to plants causes invasive fungal infections in patients undergoing HSCT, it is recommended that plants and dried or fresh flowers do not enter the room during hospitalization (conditioning phase included) because of the Aspergillus sp., isolated from soil of ornamental plants and flowers. In addition it was found a high proportion of gram-negative bacteria in the water of the cut flower vase (Pseudomonas) (Tomblyn et al. 2010).",

Loss of body image as a result of weight loss or scars, sexuality issues and concerns about employment may preoccupy a patient (Gruber et al. 2003). Nurses should be aware of the potential effect that both, the transplant and the isolation, can have on patients. Spending time with the patient and offering him or her an opportunity to talk about concerns can be helpful. Providing information, education and advice may reduce the negative psychological effects of isolation (Brown 2010).

            "text": "Sputum samples can be collected by nurses, physicians or respiratory therapists according to transplant program protocols. Respiratory virus detection is highly dependent on the type of sample collected, the time of collection after the onset of clinical symptoms, the age of the patient and the transport and storage of the sample prior to testing. Several different upper respiratory tract specimens are applicable for testing, including nasopharyngeal (NP) washes, NP aspirates and NP swabs placed in virus transport media (Specter 2009; Storch 2000). Expectorations in the early morning or after a respiratory procedure can be the easiest for the patient to produce because of the natural accumulation of secretions at these times. About 15 ml of sputum is usually required for adequate laboratory analysis, and a recent study suggested that the sputum must reach the laboratory within a few hours from expectoration (Murray et al. 2010). Sputum can also be collected during a bronchoscopy. In some cases, broncholveolar lavage (BAL) will be performed during the bronchoscopy. BAL involves the flushing of fluid (usually a sterile normal saline solution) into a localized area of the lower respiratory tract and then immediately suctioning the fluid up the bronchoscope and into a sterile specimen container. BAL allows for the detection and characterization of several respiratory pathogens, including viral, fungal and bacterial agents, and is considered a major diagnostic mechanism for Pneumocystis carinii (now called Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia (PCP) (Forsl\u00f6w et al. 2010). In patients with focal pulmonary lesions, aspergillosis or pulmonary GvHD, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is considered the first-line diagnostic method (Gupta et al. 2010).",

Early detection of CMV and advances in treatment have reduced disease and mortality associated with CMV disease. VZV can lead to pneumonia with or without classic vesicular rash. HSV/VZV prophylaxis should be initiated with the conditioning regimen and continue for 1 year or until the patient is off all immunosuppressant agents and CD4 numbers have been restored.

            "text": "All patients undergoing HSCT are at risk for pulmonary complications. Bedside nurses are the most likely to observe subtle changes in the patient\u2019s condition, and for this reason it is critical that nursing staff working with the HSCT population be highly trained in oncology and critical care interventions. Prompt reporting of symptoms can ensure proper and timely medical intervention and facilitate improved patient outcomes. This has been found particularly true in identifying GvHD, with clinical nurses at the forefront of identifying and reporting suspicious symptoms to the healthcare team (Mattson 2007). Nurses take a central role in patient and family education regarding the course of treatment, complications and other key pieces of the HSCT process, including caring for a central line (Stephens et al. 2013). By educating patients on what to expect after transplant with regard to troubling symptoms, nurses ensure patient participation in identifying developing complications early and improving HSCT outcomes. A thorough assessment can assist the nursing staff in detecting changes indicative of developing complications. Vital signs, including the rate and quality of respirations, and oximetry should be performed per program protocols, usually every 4 h and more frequently for patients at risk for pulmonary insufficiency. Taking the patient\u2019s temperature every 4 h or as necessary is another critical respiratory intervention, as most post-HSCT complications are infectious in nature (Stephens et al. 2013). Nurses are crucial in assessing patients for symptoms of bacterial infection and should perform routine laboratory tests as necessary. Regarding pulmonary infections, nurses should closely monitor patients for symptoms of progressing respiratory disease, such as decreased auscultation of air sounds in the lungs, increasing fevers and appearance of a productive cough with coloured sputum. Antibiotics should start as soon as possible in these patients. A nursing study of neutropenic patients in the early HSCT phase showed that commencement of antibiotics within 1 h of the onset of infectious symptoms can significantly reduce infectious complications, including sepsis (Hyman 2005). The recent addition of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to GvHD prophylaxis protocols has been met with mixed results. For example, a study using infliximab did not lead to lower rates of GvHD but did suggest higher rates of bacterial or fungal pulmonary infection in patients who participated in the study (Hamadani et al. 2008). It is important that patients in the post-transplant period are encouraged to pace their activity with their level of ability. Coughing and deep breathing exercises accompanying the regular use of an incentive spirometer constitute critical ways to open deep alveolar tissue and encourage pulmonary toileting on patients prone to fatigue and malaise and whose blood counts are very low (Stephens et al. 2013).",
