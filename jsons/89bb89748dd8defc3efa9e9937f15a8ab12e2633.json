These CuMVTT VLPs (hereafter CuMVTT) incorporate a universal T cell epitope derived from tetanus toxin providing pre-existing T cell help. In addition, during the production process these VLPs package bacterial RNA which is a ligand for toll-like receptor 7/8 and serves as potent adjuvants 9 . Using antigens displayed on these VLPs, it 4 was possible to induce high levels of specific antibodies in mice, rats, cats, dogs and horses and treat diseases such as atopic dermatitis in dogs or insect bite hypersensitivity in horses [9] [10] [11] . To generate a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we therefore attempted to display the RBD domain on CuMVTT (Fig. 1a) . To this end we gene-synthesized the COVID-19 RBD domain and fused it to an Fc molecule for better expression. As expected, the protein bound efficiently to the viral receptor ACE2 as determined by Sandwich ELISA (Fig. 1b) . In a next step, the protein was chemically coupled to the surface of CuMVTT using the well established chemical cross-linkers SATA and SMPH (ref. 9). SDS-Page and Western Blotting confirmed efficient coupling of the RBD-fusion molecule to CuMVTT, resulting in the vaccine candidate RBD-CuMVTT (Fig. 1c,d) .",

As shown by ELISA on recombinant RBD, RBD-CuMVTT showed strongly increased immunogenicity at all time-points tested (one week after the vaccine injection time-points). To assess the potential for anti-viral activity, we assessed whether the induced antibodies were able to block binding of the RBD protein to the viral receptor ACE2.

To this end, we generated pseudotyped retroviruses 12 expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and luciferase for quantification of infection (Fig. 4a ). Using these viruses, the neutralizing capacity of the sera from immunized mice was assessed on ACE2-transfected cells (Fig. 4b) , directly demonstrating high anti-viral neutralizing activity of the induced antibodies. Hence, the RBD-CuMVTT vaccine candidate is able to induce high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, the CuMVTT based vaccine is based on highly efficient expression systems and chemical conjugation technologies, rendering it an attractive candidate for large scale production under cGMP. Previous studies with a similar VLP-based conjugate vaccine has demonstrated that high levels of specific antibodies can be mounted within a week 13, 14 (see also Fig. 2a) , offering the additional possibilities to rapidly immunize individuals that have been exposed to infected humans or those that are kept in quarantine. Thus, vaccines based on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain displayed on VLPs may have the potential to critically interfere with global spread of the virus. 5 ",
