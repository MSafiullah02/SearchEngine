            "text": "An infection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated from Wuhan city of China in December 2019 converted rapidly into pandemic by March 11, 2020. To date, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has risen exponentially in more than 200 countries, with an estimated crude mortality ratio of at least over 2%. The unpreparedness to tackle the unprecedented situation of coronavirus has contributed to the rising number of cases, which has generated an immense sense of fear and anxiety amongst the public. It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW). Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW. Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout. The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.",

We propose firm measures to address this deficit in no particular sequence. First, empower physicians by providing essential resources adequately in the form of PPE, beds, medicines, ventilators, educational guidelines, and research updates. Second, provide consistent and updated guidelines regularly to staff for managing patients through triage based on the case priority and severity. Third, recruit additional allied healthcare and administrative staff, including medical assistants, scribes, coordinators, clerical assistants, and triage specialists, to unburden clinicians to some extend from nonclinical tasks and medical notes. Fourth, increase the workforce of clinicians by hiring additional physicians, nurse practitioners (NP), and physician assistants (PA). Furthermore, provisionally ease the rules of mandatory oversight of NPs and PAs by physicians at the times of the high volume of cases. Fifth, loosen up the restrictions on the visa requiring US-licensed physicians and allow unmatched Educational Commission For Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) certified physicians to assist at least in a limited demanded capacity. Sixth, extend the medical license that is set for renewal now and in the next six months. Seventh, initiate medical residency early for the matched candidates and allocate additional emergency budget for graduate medical education (GME) residency positions. Eight, facilitate the setup of telemedicine and telepsychiatry services to address the medical and psychiatric needs of the patients and staff. Ninth, provide support with clear communication from the leadership regarding quarantine directives, guidelines, and management protocol. Tenth, restrict excessive workload by scheduling breaks, limit work hours in emergency and intensive care units, and provide regular psychosocial support, essential basic needs, mindfulness sessions, and resilience training. Eleventh, ensure the safety and health of all staff members by the daily screening of vital signs, possible symptoms of infection, and signs of burnout. Twelfth, train, and leverage the expertise of the residents and fellows as a frontline worker to handle coronavirus cases or non-coronavirus cases. Thirteenth, protect, and support residents and fellows by creating an action plan and temporarily deferring the rules for GME training and board eligibility.",
