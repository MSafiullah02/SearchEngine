Nevertheless, weaning failure rate ranges between 26 and 42% [2]. Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has been compared to a physical exercise [3]. The transition from positive to negative intrathoracic pressure alters unfavorably cardiac loading conditions, the net result being an abrupt increase in left ventricular (LV) filling pressures [4]. Accordingly, weaning pulmonary edema (WIPO) is a leading cause of weaning failure [5, 6], especially in high-risk patients with an underlying cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or obesity [7].",

In addition, guidance of fluid management based on daily measurement of plasma BNP concentration significantly reduces fluid balance and shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, especially in the presence of LV failure [14]. Taken together, these results underline the pivotal contribution of cumulated hydric balance and potentially associated volume overload in the development of WIPO [15].",

Quantitative variables were expressed as medians with their 25th and 75th percentiles and quantitative variables as percentages. No use of previous value or interpolation rule was used in the presence of missing data. Hemodynamic parameters were compared individually between baseline and the first SBT using paired samples Wilcoxon test. Patients were separated into two groups according to the success or failure of SBT, and data were compared between groups using a Mann\u2013Whitney U test or a Chi-squared test. In the subset of patients who failed the first SBT but could be successfully extubated after the second weaning trial, individual parameters recorded at the time of the two SBTs were compared using a paired samples Wilcoxon test. Cutoff values of E wave velocity were identified to diagnose failed SBT due to WIPO, and alternatively to predict successful extubation, with a specificity > 90%. Statistical significance was defined as a p value < 0.05 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).",

            "text": "The 27% SBT failure rate observed in the present study is in keeping with that commonly reported in a high-risk population [2]. As previously reported [23], our patients who developed WIPO had significantly higher maximal E wave velocity and E/A ratio, shorter E wave deceleration time, lower LVEF, and higher tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity under positive-pressure ventilation, when compared to their counterparts. This presumably reflects the incapacity of their cardiovascular system to sustain SBT-induced abrupt increase in cardiac work load [3\u20136]. LV was abruptly overloaded by SBT as reflected by a significant rise of maximal E wave velocity and E/A ratio, a significant shortening of E wave deceleration time [23, 24], and augmented tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity used as a surrogate of systolic pulmonary artery pressure [25]. Not surprisingly, these changes were even more pronounced in the subset of our patients who failed SBT due to WIPO. E/E\u2032, a routinely used indicator of LV filling pressure, was in the lower range at baseline presumably because a large proportion of our high-risk patients received diuretics before SBT (median hydric balance: + 146 mL). In addition, E/E\u2032 failed to significantly increase during SBT because E\u2032 also increased presumably in response to sympathetic stimulation [26]. Maximal E wave velocity\u2014which directly reflects the pressure gradient between the left atrium and the LV at early diastole\u2014is the result of both LV loading conditions and relaxation properties [27]. Worsened functional mitral regurgitation during SBT may contribute to increase E wave velocity and subsequent weaning failure in response to augmented LV preload and afterload [13]. The increase in both E wave maximal velocity and E/A ratio associated with the shortening of E wave deceleration time concordantly reflect a significant rise of LV filling pressure [4], since these parameters are correlated to the pulmonary capillary pressure in patients with LV systolic dysfunction [22, 27, 28], a large proportion of our study population. In light of the absence of significant ST-segment variations during SBTs, this suggests that the abrupt rise of LV filling pressure induced by SBT was related to LV overload rather than deteriorated LV relaxation or compliance of ischemic origin [4, 6]. This pathophysiologic mechanism is also supported by the higher weight gain and cumulative fluid balance relative to ICU admission in patients who failed SBT [8\u201313]. Of note, with the exception of higher heart rate\u2014a rather non-specific sign\u2014no clinical parameter was significantly associated with SBT failure in our patients. This underlines the additional value of monitoring central hemodynamics using CCE during weaning trial in patients at high risk of WIPO [15, 29, 30].",

            "text": "In our high-risk patients who passed SBT, the absence of relevant central hemodynamic changes identified with CCE during the weaning trial confirmed the feasibility of extubation. This diagnostic strategy was successful since no extubation failure of cardiac origin was observed after tracheal tube withdrawal. In those who failed the first SBT, CCE was used to guide therapy according to a predefined therapeutic algorithm. Since a relevant increase in E wave velocity consistent with an overloaded LV was observed in most patients at the time of SBT failure, diuretics and vasodilators were predominantly used to reduce both LV preload and afterload [31, 32]. A beta-blocker was used in a patient with a dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction and severe acute mitral regurgitation related to a systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve [33]. After these therapeutic changes, all patients who initially failed the first SBT could be subsequently extubated successfully. Immediately before and during passed second SBT, maximal E wave velocity, E/A and E/E\u2032 ratios, and tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity were lower than at the time of failed first weaning trial, whereas E wave deceleration time was prolonged. In our patients with relevant functional mitral insufficiency at baseline, the regurgitant volume reflected by the jet area significantly decreased between the two weaning trials. The resulting relative increase in E wave velocity induced by the weaning trial was significantly lower during the second (passed) SBT when compared to the first (failed) one. These changes suggest that CCE-guided therapy unloaded LV within a median delay of 2.5 days. The significant decrease in body weight and cumulated fluid balance relative to the first weaning trial suggest a link between LV overload and excessive fluid balance at the origin of WIPO. Volume overload has been associated with worse weaning outcome [34, 35].",

            "text": "The present results may not be reproducible using other types of weaning trial. Low-pressure support level without PEEP has been shown to induce less central hemodynamic variations than SBT using a T-piece [36]. In a recent meta-analysis, Sklar et al. [37] suggested that SBT using a T-piece best mimics changes in cardiac and respiratory loading conditions resulting from extubation. In our high-risk population, its use has presumably sensitized SBT to reveal WIPO. Since the precise cutoff value of LV filling pressure which would precipitate the development of WIPO is unknown for a given patient [4] and most Doppler indices are in the intermediate range at baseline [38, 39], the magnitude of SBT-induced variations should be precisely determined and interpreted in lights of clinical presentation, the patient being his own control. When compared to right-heart catheterization which is considered the reference for the diagnosis of WIPO [4], CCE is less invasive, rapid to implement, easy to use, and depicts certain mechanisms of WIPO which are not accessible to conventional monitoring systems, such as LV outflow tract obstruction as in one of our patient. In this specific clinical setting, right heart catheterization typically depicts elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and low cardiac index which may erroneously lead to diuretics, vasodilators or even inotropes therapy, all of them exacerbating the hemodynamic burden [33].",
