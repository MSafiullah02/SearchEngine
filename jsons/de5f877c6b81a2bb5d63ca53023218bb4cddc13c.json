The World Health Organization has recently announced this disease to constitute a public health emergency of international concern and then named this disease as Corona Virus Disease 2019 . By the 28 Feb, 2020, more than 80,0 0 0 confirmed cases including over 2500 death cases were officially announced. Till now, the infection control and surveillance focus on respiratory system. The ignorance of SARS-CoV-2 in digestive system may cause troubles in the disease control.",

However, they should not be ignored as the increasing rate of diarrhea occurs in confirmed COVID-19 patients according to a recent report that 14 of 138 confirmed patients had diarrhea [4] . Those early reports may not represent actual rate of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2, because in early stages of the outbreak, the limited resources for detection were only provided to those patients with severe symptoms like respiratory distress syndrome. About 27 percent of SARS patients have diarrhea and since full-length genome sequences identified that SARS-CoV-2 is 79.5% identical to SARS-CoV and share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), it is estimated that rate of gastrointestinal symptoms would be higher in patients with COVID-19 [5] .",

The evidence for this route is that all of the specimens including pharyngeal swab, esophageal biopsy, gastric mucosa, rectal mucosa, duodenal mucosa and stool tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 in two cases [7] . Another route may be bloodstream infection since SARS-CoV-2 was directly detected in bleeding site in one case [7] . In addition, expression of ACE2 in endothelial cells and macrophages, as well as the detection of SARS-CoV in plasma and blood lymphocytes also support the possibility of bloodstream infection of SARS-CoV-2 [8 , 9] .",

As findings showed that patients with SARS could discharge SARS-CoV in their stool up to 73 days after symptom onset, the stools with the virus became the resource of contamination of airdrops and a variety of environmental surfaces, which may contribute to the clusters of infection [13] . Similarly, evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 were identified in 4 stool specimens (4 out of 62), so fomite transmission should not be ignored in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus may move from respiratory tract in to gastrointestinal tract the recovered patients may discharge the stool with virus for a long time [9] .",
