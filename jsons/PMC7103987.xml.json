            "text": "The differential recognition of viruses by RIG-I and MDA5 has been attributed to their distinct preferences for RNA ligands. RIG-I can be activated by 5\u2032-triphosphate (ppp)-containing RNAs as well as short (<2 kbp) dsRNAs (Kato et al., 2011). The ligand specificity of RIG-I provides an explanation for how it differentiates viral RNAs from cellular RNAs. Many RNA viruses carry genomes that contain 5\u2032ppp or produce 5\u2032ppp-containing RNAs during their replication cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells, whereas cytoplasmic cellular RNAs generally lack 5\u2032ppp. The ligands of MDA5 are as yet poorly defined. MDA5 is activated by transfection of a long (>2 kbp), synthetic dsRNA analog of artificial sequence, namely polyinosinic:polycytidylic [poly(I:C)]. Additionally, transfection-based experiments showed that the L segments of the reovirus genome (\u223c3.9 kbp dsRNAs) induce an IFN-\u03b2 response that is partially dependent on MDA5 (Kato et al., 2006). Based on these findings, it is believed that MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs, which would be intrinsically \u201cnonself.\u201d However, little is known about the identities and characteristics of physiological ligands of MDA5 in infected cells.",

            "text": "Many (+)RNA viruses, including picornaviruses, produce dsRNAs during infection. Picornaviridae is a large, highly diverse family of human and animal viruses, including many pathogens of great medical and/or economical significance. The picornavirus genome is a 7.5\u20138.5 kb ssRNA molecule that harbors a single open reading frame flanked by structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nontranslated regions and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end. The 5\u2032 terminus contains a small (20\u201324 aa) viral peptide, VPg, linked via an unusual tyrosine-RNA phosphodiester bond. Upon virus entry and uncoating, the virion RNA (vRNA) is released into the cytoplasm where it is directly translated. Viral RNA templates used for protein synthesis no longer contain VPg due to the activity of a yet unknown cellular enzyme (further referred to as unlinkase) (Rozovics et al., 2011). The viral polyprotein is proteolytically processed to release the viral proteins that engage in genomic RNA replication. During this complex process, several species of viral RNAs with unique features are generated (Figure 2A). First, the viral genomic ssRNA is transcribed into a complementary (\u2212)RNA by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using VPg as primer, yielding a 7.5 kbp dsRNA named the replicative form (RF). The (\u2212)RNA is subsequently used as a template for VPg-primed synthesis of large amounts of new (+)RNAs, which are identical to vRNA. Newly synthesized (+)RNAs either enter a new cycle of translation and RNA replication or are encapsidated to form new virion particles. During the process of (+)RNA synthesis, a partially ds replicative intermediate (RI)\u2014consisting of multiple incomplete (+)RNAs undergoing active transcription along the full-length (\u2212)RNA\u2014is formed.",

Based on the observation that MDA5 recognizes EMCV and TMEV, both members of the Cardiovirus genus, and CVB3, an Enterovirus (Kato et al., 2011), it is generally assumed that all picornaviruses are recognized by MDA5, but experimental proof for this is lacking. Here, we set out to investigate the role of RLRs in the recognition of representative picornaviruses from various genera using wild-type (WT) and RIG-I\u2212/\u2212, MDA5\u2212/\u2212, or MAVS\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). To bypass the requirement for specific entry receptors, we introduced vRNAs into the cytoplasm by transfection rather than infection. Figure 1\nA shows IFN-\u03b2 responses in WT and knockout MEFs triggered by transfection of vRNA of WT mengovirus (a strain of EMCV) or infection of a mutant mengovirus (mengo-Zn). This virus generates high levels of IFN-\u03b2 because its IFN antagonist has been compromised (Hato et al., 2007). Both methods resulted in a MDA5- and MAVS-dependent, but RIG-I-independent, IFN-\u03b2 induction, demonstrating the suitability of the transfection method to identify the RLR(s) responsible for detecting picornaviruses.",

The ssRNA pool of infected cells contained one additional RNA species of the same electrophoretic mobility as purified CVB3 vRNA (Figure 2C), suggesting that it represents viral genomic ssRNA. Although partially ds, the viral RI is known to precipitate by 2M LiCl (Richards et al., 1984), the same condition used here to prepare ssRNA fractions. However, the amount of RI is most likely too low to be detected on gel. The dsRNA pool of CVB3-infected cells contained an RNA species of approximately 7.5 kbp that was absent in the dsRNA pool of mock-infected cells (Figure 2B). Both the viral ssRNA and dsRNA bands were absent in HeLa cells infected with CVB3 in the presence of GuHCl (Figure 2B), a well-known inhibitor of enterovirus (\u2212)RNA synthesis (Barton and Flanegan, 1997) (Figures 2D and S2\n), demonstrating that these RNAs were of viral origin.",

In the dsRNA fractions, we observed two bands on gel; an infection-specific, 7.5 kbp species, and a larger fragment that was present in both mock- and CVB3-infected samples. To determine the nature of the higher band, we treated the dsRNA fractions with nucleases specific for ssRNA (RNase A), dsRNA (RNase III), and DNA. The nonspecific larger band was completely digested upon DNase treatment, indicating that it was DNA (Figure 3B).

In line with this conclusion, we found that VPg-containing vRNA (Figures 4D and 4E), VPg-unlinked viral mRNAs (Figure 4E), and in vitro transcribed ssRNAs of viral sequence (Figures S3B and S3C) all failed to induce any IFN-\u03b2 response when purified and transfected into cells.",

CHX prevents protein synthesis and thereby RNA replication. DIP has little effect on (\u2212)RNA synthesis but strongly inhibits (+)RNA synthesis in cell-free extract (Fata-Hartley and Palmenberg, 2005). Indeed, (\u2212)RNAs were detected in cells infected in the presence of DIP, but not CHX, using a strand-specific PCR (Figure 5C). The finding that the signal obtained from DIP-treated cells was lower than that from no-drug-treated cells likely reflects a reduced amount of (\u2212)RNA as DIP only allows (\u2212)RNA synthesis from incoming genomic (+)RNA, whereas in the absence of DIP newly synthesized (+)RNAs can enter a new round of RNA replication, and therefore lead to the production of more RF.",

Additionally, when CHX or DIP was added at 3 hr.p.i., a maximal IFN-\u03b2 response was observed in DIP-treated cells, but virtually no IFN-\u03b2 was induced in the CHX-treated cells (Figure 5D). Analysis of viral RNA levels indicate that only a few new (+)RNAs had been made because addition of either CHX or DIP at this time point led to only a slight increase in viral RNA copy number at 12 hr.p.i. These newly synthesized (+)RNAs could serve as template to make additional RFs in the DIP-treated cells, but not in the CHX-treated cells, and result in the increase of IFN-\u03b2 induction observed at 3 hr p.i. It is theoretically possible that the observed differences in IFN-\u03b2 levels in CHX- and DIP-treated cells were due to nonspecific blockade or stimulation of the RLR signaling pathway by CHX or DIP, respectively. However, this is unlikely because these drugs had no such effects on poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 responses (Figure S5\n).",

Furthermore, the RF contains a large unpaired poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end of the (+)RNA (van Ooij et al., 2006). To investigate whether these features are important for MDA5 activation, we produced CVB3 and mengovirus dsRNAs with 5\u2032ppp and perfectly paired termini by in vitro transcription (ivt dsRNA) and compared them with viral RF purified from infected cells for their ability to activate MDA5. Strikingly, all dsRNAs triggered a similar IFN-\u03b2 response upon transfection into RIG-I\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Figure 5F). Additionally, CVB3 ivt dsRNA activated MDA5 to a similar extent as CVB3 RF in our in vitro ATPase assay (Figure 3F).

Based on transfection experiments using poly(I:C), MDA5 is believed to recognize long dsRNAs.

Furthermore, a virally encoded peptide, VPg, is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 terminus of picornavirus RNAs via a unique tyrosine-RNA bond, providing a potential \u201cnonself\u201d signature at the 5\u2032 end.

Viral ssRNAs, on the other hand, proved poor MDA5 stimuli. Neither vRNA (VPg-containing) nor viral mRNA (VPg-lacking) induced an IFN-\u03b2 response when transfected into cells. This is in line with the observation that the full-length EMCV RNA failed to activate MDA5 ATPase activity in vitro (Peisley et al., 2011). Although we could not test IFN-stimulatory activity of purified RI, this molecule does not seem to play a crucial role in inducing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 because treatment of the CVB3 ssRNA fraction with RNase A did not affect its ability to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2.

First, transfection delivers large amounts of viral RNA directly into the cytoplasm at once. This is different from the RNA release process during infectious entry as well as the gradual accumulation of viral RNAs during virus replication. Second, purified, and therefore \u201cnaked,\u201d RNAs are transfected into cells whereas viral RNAs are heavily coated with viral and host factors during infection. Third, (+)RNA viruses induce the formation of membranous replication organelles, which may restrict access of MDA5 to replication intermediates such as RF and RI. To gain insight into MDA5 activation in a more physiologically relevant situation, we studied MDA5 activation in infected cells. Our data show that the incoming genomic ssRNA alone cannot induce any detectable IFN-\u03b2 response even when large amounts were delivered by high MOI infection. When (\u2212)RNA synthesis (i.e., formation of RF) was permitted but (+)RNA synthesis (i.e., formation of RI) was inhibited, a significant upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was observed. These data further support the idea that picornavirus RF is the essential MDA5 agonist in the course of infection. Of note, a much higher IFN-\u03b2 response was observed when RNA replication was allowed to proceed fully (i.e., in the absence of inhibitor). Although this finding may be interpreted as that RIs also activate MDA5, this increase can be attributed, at least partly, to the increased amount of RF produced from newly synthesized (+)RNAs that enter new rounds of RNA replication.",

Because picornavirus RF harbors distinctive termini, we investigated whether this terminal composition of the RF is essential for MDA5 activation. Changing the physiological terminal groups of RF into 5\u2032ppp and fully complemented 3\u2032 end did not change its ability to induce IFN-\u03b2 upregulation.

These data suggest that MDA5 may not require its substrate to be longer than a strict cut-off size. In line with this, others have demonstrated efficient activation of MDA5 ATPase activity by dsRNAs as short as 112 bp (Peisley et al., 2011). Authors of this paper also showed that MDA5 ATPase activity, which is triggered by ligand binding, induces disassembly of MDA5 from the RNA ligand, the rate of which is inversely related to the length of the bound RNA molecule (Peisley et al., 2011).

Two other cellular proteins, namely RNaseL and PKR, have also been implicated in virus recognition (Kato et al., 2011). RNaseL has been suggested to process RNAs to generate ligands for RIG-I (Malathi et al., 2010) and MDA5 (Luthra et al., 2011), while PKR has been implicated in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 protein synthesis in response to a number of RNA viruses (Carpentier et al., 2007; Nallagatla et al., 2011). To investigate whether RNaseL and/or PKR also play a role in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in response to picornaviruses, we infected WT cells or cells deficient in RNaseL or PKR with mengo-Zn virus and examined their abilities to induce IFN-\u03b2 transcription. Instead of RNaseL\u2212/\u2212 MEFs we made use of a commonly used RNase L-deficient cell line, HeLa M (Dong et al., 2001; Xiang et al., 2003). These cells express virtually no RNaseL (Figure S1A) and no RNaseL activity, as demonstrated by rRNA degradation, was detectable in HeLa M cells after transfection of poly(I:C) or 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates (Data not shown). Neither deficient cell line showed any major defect in triggering IFN-\u03b2 gene transcription upon infection as compared to their WT control cells (Figures S1B and S1C), arguing against significant involvement of PKR or RNaseL in detecting picornavirus RNA.The lack of a role of PKR in picornavirus recognition seems to be at odds with a previous report of reduced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 protein levels in TMEV-infected astrocytes in the absence of PKR (Carpentier et al., 2007). This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the recently identified role of PKR in controlling IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses at the post-transcriptional level by regulating the integrity of the poly(A) tail of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA (Schulz et al., 2010). Together with our data that the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA is unaffected in picornavirus-infected PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, it seems that PKR does not participate in the initial detection of picornavirus RNA in MEFs.\n",

RIG-I+/\u2212, RIG-I\u2212/\u2212, MDA5+/+ and MDA5\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were provided by Prof. S. Akira (Osaka University, Japan), MAVS+/+ and MAVS\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were provided by Z.J. Chen (University of Texas, Dallas, USA), and PKR+/+ and PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Abraham et al., 1999) were provided by Prof. John Bell (Ottawa Regional Cancer Center, Ontario, Canada) through Thomas Michiels.VirusesBoth WT mengovirus and mengo-Zn were obtained by transfection of in vitro RNA transcripts of infectious cDNA clone based on pM16.1, which contains a copy of mengovirus with a shortened poly C tract (Zoll et al., 1996). Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3, strain Nancy) was obtained by transfection of in vitro RNA transcripts of p53CB3/T7, an infectious clone that contains a full-length cDNA of CVB3 (Wessels et al., 2005). Saffold virus 3 (SAFV3, strain NL2007) and human parechovirus type 1 (HPeV, strain 755532) have been described previously (Zoll et al., 2009a; Zoll et al., 2009b). Enterovirus 71 (EV71, strain Br-Cr) and Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21, strain Kuykendall) were obtained from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM, Bilthoven, the Netherlands). Equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV, strain NM11/67) was a kind gift from T. Tuthill and D. Rowlands (University of Leeds, United Kingdom). Mengoviruses were propagated on BHK-21 cells. CVB3, ERAV, EV71 were propagated on BGM cells. CVA21 and SAFV3 were propagated on HeLa cells. HPeV1 was propagated on Vero cells. Virus titers were determined by endpoint titration as described previously (van Kuppeveld et al., 1995).IFN Reporter Assays1 \u00d7 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 200 ng of pIFN-\u03b2-luc (Fitzgerald et al., 2003) and 50 ng pRL-TK (Promega; an internal control that constitutively expresses Renilla luciferase) using Fugene-6 (Roche). Cells were incubated for 24 hr and were either mock treated, infected with virus, or transfected with RNA using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Luciferase activity was measured at the indicated time points using the Dual-luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Firefly luciferase values were divided by Renilla luciferase values to normalize for transfection efficiency and are shown as fold induction over mock.Real-Time qPCR Analysis2 \u00d7 105 cells were transfected with indicated amounts of RNA using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. At the indicated time points, total cellular RNA was harvested using GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) prior to reverse transcription, which was performed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative analysis of gene expression was performed using qPCR, using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche). Reactions were carried out by a LightCycler 480 (Roche) and primary data analysis was done with the provided software. The following primers were used. Murine IFN-\u03b2 forward (fw) and reverse (rv) primers: 5\u2032-CAGCTCCAAGAAAGGACGAAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGCAGTGTAACTCTTCTGCAT-3\u2032, respectively. Primer sequences were acquired from the Primerbank (Wang and Seed, 2003) (Primerbank ID 6754304a1). Murine HPRT fw and rv primers: 5\u2032-GTAATGATCAGTCAACGGGGGAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCAGCAAGCTTGCAACCTTAACCA-3\u2032, respectively. Human IFN-\u03b2 fw and rv primers: 5\u2032-ATGACCAACAAGTGTCTCCTCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTCATGGAAAGAGCTGTAGTG-3\u2032, respectively. Human Actin fw and rv primers: 5\u2032-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTC-3\u2032, respectively.Preparation of Full-Length IVT RNAsThe in vitro transcribed CVB3 RNA was generated by using cDNA clones p53CB3/T7 (Wessels et al., 2005) or pRibCB3/T7 (van Ooij et al., 2006) as templates. Uncapped, in vitro transcribed RNAs from linearized plasmids were synthesized using Riboprobe in vitro transcription systems (Promega) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Clean-up reactions were performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNAs were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and again cleaned up. RNA integrity was checked on agarose gel. To produce IVT dsRNAs of CVB3 and mengovirus the full-length genomes were amplified by PCR using primers with flanking T7 and Phi6 promoter sites and the cDNA clones p53CB3/T7 and pM16.1 as templates, respectively. dsRNAs were in vitro transcribed using Replicator RNAi Kit (Finnzyme) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Generation of Partially Purified VPg UnlinkaseApproximately 70 ml of packed HeLa cells were homogenized by cryogenic grinding (Retsch) then solubilized in TDE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 70,000 x g for 1 hr and the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by successive chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech), Heparin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), Sephacryl S200 (GE Healthcare), and Mono Q (Amersham) to generate partially purified unlinkase. To generate VPg-depleted ssRNA, 5 \u03bcl of partially purified unlinkase or buffer was incubated with 0.4 pmol of vRNA in a 20 \u03bcl reaction volume containing PDGM buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2) for 30 min at 30\u00b0C. To assay for the removal of VPg from vRNA, parallel reactions were spiked with 700 CPM 35S-methionine labeled vRNA and quantified as described in (Rozovics et al., 2011).Isolation of 35S-methionine Labeled vRNAA mutant poliovirus carrying a VPg that can be radioactively labeled with [35S]methionine and the method for isolating 35S-methionine labeled vRNA have been described previously (Rozovics et al., 2011). Briefly, 1 mCi of 35S-methionine was added to HeLa cells in suspension culture following poliovirus W1-VPg31 infection and methionine starvation for three hours at 37\u00b0C. At six hours post infection, the infected cells were pelleted and subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing in RSB+MgCl2 buffer (10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2) to release the virions. The virions in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation at 29,700 rpm for 3.5 hr in a Ti 70.1 rotor at 24\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and then applied to a 15%\u201330% sucrose gradient (5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% SDS) and centrifuged at 27,700 rpm for 2.5 hr in an SW41 at 24\u00b0C. Fractions containing 35S-methionine labeled virions were identified by scintillation counting, pooled and then subjected to two cycles of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The final volume of 35S-methionine labeled vRNA was adjusted to 700 cpm/\u03bcl (\u223c0.04 pmol/\u03bcl).In Vitro MDA5 ATPase AssayRecombinant MDA5 protein was purified as previously described (PNAS, 2011, 108(52):21010-5). Following a 3 min pre-incubation of 0.3 uM MDA5 with 0.3 \u03bcg/ml nucleic acid in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 at 37 C the reaction was initiated by addition of 2 mM ATP. Aliquots were withdrawn at time 0, 30 and 60 min, and were quenched with 50 mM EDTA. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed was determined by measuring released phosphate using BIOMOL Green Reagent (Enzo), which was added to the quenched reaction at a ratio of 9:1. OD650 was measured using a Synergy2 plate reader (BioTek).\n",
