            "text": "COVID-19 is spreading worldwide and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the international epidemic to be of a global nature: COVID-19 was by that date officially regarded as a pandemic. With 104 countries affected, about 420,000 people infected and nearly 19,000 fatalities (for an overview see the map of the WHO as of March 25, 20201 and tables in Appendix 1 Tables 7 and 8). As of mid-March, 146 countries were affected, 154,000 people had been infected and 5700 fatalities had been recorded. In absolute terms, the number of infections was very high in China with 81,048 cases, followed by Italy (21,157), Iran (12,729), Republic of Korea (8162), Spain (5753), France (4469), Germany (3795), US (1678), Switzerland (1359) and the UK (1144). Given the nature of the pandemic, the picture quickly changes: For March 23, 2020, the WHO reported 81,601 cases in China which is roughly a stagnation, but Italy already had recorded 59,138, Spain 28,572, Germany 24,774 and France 15,821 cases. The age distribution of coronavirus-related deaths for China shows that the elderly have, not surprisingly, a higher mortality than the average. One economic implication is that, on the one hand, the effective labor force should be negatively affected by COVID-19. On the other hand, there is an unclear effect on retired persons and the overall death rate as the shut-down of firms improves the overall air quality and thus could reduce the number of people falling ill from non-coronavirus diseases (Fenz and Kharas 2020). With hospitals facing full capacity utilization in acute care capacities, the survival rate of other inpatients and outpatients with serious illnesses (non COVID-19) could fall. As regards the WHO figures, one may note that the oft-cited figures published by the Johns Hopkins University differ due to the broader statistical coverage by the latter.",

International tourism will be very modest in 2020 and might not recover before the second half of 2021. In a normal recession, tourism \u2013 representing a large economic sector in many countries \u2013 is usually not much affected. A lack of vacation time in turn and the stress from the threat of the pandemic might also depress considerable strata of society for some time so that productivity could decline strongly for many months. As PSA, Renault, Fiat-Chrysler, Volkswagen and other EU car producers have announced on March 16 that production in several plants will be shut down for several months in Europe a deep recession cannot be excluded, as there could be a unique overlap of declining manufacturing output and services sector contraction, including tourism. There is also the risk that the normal chain of payments could be interrupted as firms or households face serious liquidity constraints \u2013 and firms or banks\u2019 solvency constraints - if the economic crisis deepens. A deepening economic crisis will make it more difficult to bolster the resources allocated to the health sector. The hospital sector is obviously crucial to the response to the coronavirus epidemic and here the indicators are critical for many countries, including many EU countries, namely when acute care beds relative to the elderly population are considered (see subsequent sections). This contribution brings together macroeconomic and health system aspects in a somewhat unusual way, but this perspective could be useful for the analysis of the coronavirus epidemic (Map 1).",

After the peak has been reached, the number of infected will gradually fall. From this perspective, the macroeconomic effects in a first stage of an epidemic should be rather modest, followed by a peak of negative output shocks \u2013 finally followed by a potentially enhanced economic upswing as postponed investment and consumption in the private sector could increase. Both mortality and morbidity statistics published should affect aggregate demand on the one hand, but also aggregate supply on the other hand as there will be less people working in factories and offices in an epidemic period. Of particular relevance for the control of the spatial spreading of COVID-19 are measures which effectively impose a quarantine on those who are infected; and for many other people, the authorities could impose restrictions on mobility at the regional, the national and the global level. Many people, including tourists and business people, will be eager to reduce their level of international travel, particularly to regions/countries with high infection problems. From this perspective, China \u2013 where COVID-19 started in late 2019 \u2013 has a specific problem, but one should also notice that China has had growing numbers of visitors, including business people, and tourists in the two decades after 1990 (see Appendix Fig. 9).",

Given the fact that health care expenditures relative to gross domestic product in industrialized countries are between 8 and 18% in 2019, it seems crucial to link health care expenditure analysis to the more traditional macroeconomic analysis. Indeed, there is a lack of such analysis as has already been noted by Gerdtham and Jonsson (2000) in their classical health care analysis contribution \u201cInternational Comparison of Health Expenditure: Theory, Data and Econometric Analysis\u201d in the Handbook of Health Economics. The coronavirus shock to the world economy is a case where indeed an overlap of macroeconomic analysis and health care analysis indeed makes a lot of sense. To the extent that the COVID-19 shock reduces real income for several quarters in many countries, one should also see a medium term decline of health care expenditures (after the short-term transitory peak determined by the epidemic) since the demand for health care rises over-proportionately with real income.",

New York seemed to be a regional hot spot and on March 24 the Trump Administration declared that visitors to New York should undergo 14 days in self-isolation. Given the fact that New York had 64 million US visitors plus 14 million foreign visitors plus an unknow number of New York people who visited friends or business colleagues and other institutions in the US, and indeed outside the US, the New York cluster indeed stands for a crucial challenge. Assuming that 500,000 US visitors had been in New York as visitors in the two weeks prior to March 24, about half a million US citizens should go into quarantine and the roughly 100,000 foreign visitors who had visited New York in the same period should also followed the advice for a self-imposed quarantine. However, these people apparently have not been contacted although airlines could have been mobilized to track foreign visitors and to alert them about the need for self-quarantine. This is an example of how poorly organized the world economy is in facing the challenge of a pandemic and how negligent authorities in the US and outside the US have dealt with the fact that New York is a coronavirus hot spot. While the very nature of a pandemic calls for global economic cooperation, it seems that such cooperation is at a premium in 2020; to what extent political populism contributes to this problem could be an important aspect in future research.",

Psychological effects on the demand side could play a strong role in the current epidemic and negative effects on the aggregate demand side could overlap with supply-side disturbances from international problems in the delivery of intermediate inputs. Liquidity problems on the side of firms could also contribute to an economic slowdown, moreover liquidity problems of major banks might occur in many countries so that output decline in OECD countries as well as in China and other countries could be considerable. In early March 2020, McKibbin and Fernando (2020) have presented a macro model with various scenarios for the world economy which show a large range of negative possible real GDP outcomes in the context of the COVID-19 challenge, including a major international recession.",

The type of shock represented by the coronavirus pandemic is normally not considered in standard macroeconomic simulations \u2013 hence the combined effect of a shutdown of the tourism sector and the hospitality sector plus the automotive sector plus other services (say, a barber shop closed for several weeks as a consequence of epidemic-related government regulations \u2013 with no relative price adjustment able to bring about a new market equilibrium in the short term) first have to appear on the analytical radar of simulation expert groups. The duration of the demand effect is rather uncertain in the early stage of the pandemic, but even once the duration becomes clear after a few months there could be serious balance sheet effects on companies with limited working capital and short-term debt maturities \u2013 hence, even a temporary closure of firms can have serious effects in some economic sectors. It is thus not clear that after a few months of the temporary shutdown of many firms, one could more or less reset the whole economy and continue output expansion on the old level of the growth path. Since the pandemic shock affects nearly all countries of the world economy there is also an unusual global synchronization of the shock and the big fiscal packages considered in the US, the EU, the UK and in other countries clearly imply a medium-term rise of debt-GDP ratios in OECD countries and many newly industrialized countries. Developing countries without much room to maneuver will need strong support by the IMF, the World Bank and regional multilateral banks. The coronavirus pandemic thus is a challenge that requires a multilateral response. Multilateralism, however, is not the favored approach of the Trump Administration with its emphasis on bilateralism. By implication, there will be a lack of US leadership in this international economic crisis that in turn also could raise doubts about standard open economy simulation results.",

As long as the coronavirus challenge can be overcome in a medical sense by autumn 2020, postponed consumption and investment should be useful to contribute to a new economic upswing in 2021 and beyond; an adequate mix of monetary policy and fiscal policy can contribute to overcoming the incipient recession. To the extent that China, the US, the EU27 plus the UK and Japan adopt similar expansionary policy, there will be international spillover effects on the one hand which reinforces the upswing. However, quantitative easing (QE) which normally brings about a nominal and real devaluation, and a decline of the interest rate, will not bring much output expansion through the real devaluation impulse if several big countries adopt similar QE policies.",

It is not clear that monetary policy is suitable to counter-balance the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic whose economic disturbance is largely a supply-side disturbance (shocks to international production networks) and liquidity problems of many firms as well as some aggregate demand weakening. Fiscal expansion packages had also been adopted in the US, the UK and some leading EU countries by mid-March 2020.

It is obvious that fighting a global public evil requires cooperation among the leading economies and in the relevant international organizations (e.g. the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, UNHCR \u2013 in the case of refugees). In this perspective, the fact that the world\u2019s global technological leader, the United States, is governed by the Trump Administration which refutes multilateralism might become a serious problem. Fighting a pandemic is a global public good and if there are considerable political free rider problems, or simply political inconsistencies and inefficiencies in major OECD countries, the fight against the global epidemic will be not really successful. This in turn implies that many more lives could be lost than in the case of efficient and effective global cooperation.",

If national and international epidemic shocks translate into a serious economic slowdown in China in 2020, it will automatically have major negative international spillovers to the EU and the US and from these two actors there will be a strong negative repercussion effect on China. In short, a COVID-19 pandemic in the new world economy of triadic interdependency EU-US-China, requires enhanced international cooperation and multilateralism; but the Trump Administration is emphasizing bilateralism which means that the efficiency of OECD countries+China fiscal/monetary policy cannot be efficient. This in turn makes fighting the pandemic more difficult since an economic downturn in the global North would undermine economic stability and prosperity in the global South which implies that the problem of insufficient resources in the health sector of developing countries would be reinforced. The very nature of a pandemic is, however, such that the South of the world economy could be directly affected by the COVID-19 shock, and relatively poor countries \u2013 with rather weak public health systems \u2013 could face massive problems in dealing with the health care challenges as well as with the economic effects from this shock.",

There are some links between this indicator and macroeconomic development, including the following:A high score in the Global Health Security Index could be interpreted as a quality signal by foreign investors for whom often high quality health provision for managers in the host country, as well as a good health system for the workers employed in the subsidiary abroad, are important aspects to consider in the context of international investment and locational choice for greenfield investment projects or international M&As.Not only does the quality of the respective health system matter but also the efficiency of the health system and hence cost aspects \u2013 indirectly visible in tax rates and social security contribution rates \u2013 of production.

In a similar EU-related simulation study on the macro effects of an epidemic, Jonung and Roeger (2006) adopt a similar analytical approach, but also assume a permanent negative shock to population growth (\u22120.75%).",

The leading country in the relevant Global Health Security Index, according to this study is the US, with a No. 1 ranking in the aggregated overall indicator, other OECD countries and some Newly Industrialized Countries are also in the group of leading countries. The UK and the Netherlands are ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, in the aggregate Health Security Indicator, France is ranked No. 11, and Germany No. 14 in the aggregate indicator. Developing countries typically have low rankings in the overall indicator and the sub-indicators.

In a small open economy, an expansionary monetary policy under fixed exchange rate would be not effective; only fiscal policy would work \u2013 and it could work if government can finance some deficit spending with a clear focus on the non-tradable sector (e.g. construction activities for infrastructure).Fiscal policy, which mainly concerns the US, EU countries, the UK and China plus other Asian countries exposed to the virus shock; Thailand, for example, normally has a rather high number of Chinese tourists and business people visiting every year, but with the problem of COVID-19 in China, these visits will decline dramatically and Thailand could decide to adopt an expansionary fiscal policy. A similar logic could hold for other ASEAN countries as well.

The US interest rate reduction will stimulate aggregate demand in the US and, in this context, could also stimulate net exports of goods and services through a real depreciation of the currency.

The US-Sino trade conflict has at least been moderated somewhat through the US-China trade agreement in early February 2020 so that some bilateral coordination of fiscal policies of the US and China is not excluded. Some coordination between the US and the EU countries could take place via the OECD, but given the competence gap in the Trump Administration in the Treasury, this might be difficult to achieve: The Trump Administration could fill only about 3000 of the roughly 4000 political appointee roles which became vacant at the end of the previous Obama Administration, which means that the Trump Administration suffers from a lack of about 1000 experts in key fields (Welfens 2019) \u2013 and the Treasury is a key institution exposed here.

It is not fully clear whether or not the Trump Administration has considered this research and its implications. In talks with the leading insurance companies on March 10 (and in the days before), the Trump Administration has negotiated that the costs of testing for the novel coronavirus would largely be covered by these companies. However, with 13% of the population without health insurance coverage, there is some specific US health care problem since people who are uninsured might turn to physicians rather late or not at all, if they have symptoms that resemble COVID-19. Illegal immigrants also might become a problem in the fight against the epidemic in the US. An apparent gap in terms of US health management is the lack of testing in February 2020 as pointed out in the international comparison of the US, the Republic of Korea and China (Meyer and Madrigal 2020).",

Typically, output would face a short-term decline but thereafter it would recover rather quickly. A crucial element of an epidemic shock in the first quarter of 2006 \u2013 the scenario considered - would be the negative effect on the tourism and entertainment sectors that accounted for 4.4% in the EU25 and also in the US. If one would assume an 80% output decline in demand, the output decline would be 3.5% of GDP in the next quarter and, for the whole year, the aggregate demand effect would translate into a real GDP dampening of 0.5%. However, in the following year, GDP would increase by one percentage point more than in the baseline scenario. Clearly, within the EU, southern countries/countries in the Mediterranean area could be assumed to be particularly affected by the epidemic shock since the share of tourism and entertainment in these countries would be relatively large. In the Jonung and Roeger (2006) approach, about 2/3rds of the European output shock is supply-induced while 1/3rd is demand induced. The key finding of the authors thus is that a strong output reduction \u2013 relative to the business-as-usual case \u2013 will occur in an epidemic, but part of the dip in output will be recovered the following year.",

Given the size of the Eurozone, a dampening on Eurozone output would translate into a dampening effect on US exports and output, respectively; and the same applies to a dampening effect on Chinese exports and real GDP. One may also note that the authors did not consider the role of rising costs in the health system. Such costs could indeed be considerable and since health costs in the US, Germany/France (Western Europe; read: Eurozone) and China differ considerably, one should indeed consider the effects of an international epidemic shock on the relative health care costs and the implications for the respective trade balances and current account positions, respectively.",

            "text": "As regards the US and the Eurozone, it is useful to consider some key aspects of the respective health care systems; for simplicity, the Eurozone will be considered here only as the sum of Germany and France \u2013 occasionally as Germany, France and Italy. The main differences between the US and Germany are as follows:The health care expenditure-GDP ratio is 18% in the USA (for 2018), but only 12% in Germany and France, while life expectancy in the Eurozone is clearly higher and infant mortality lower than in the US (for more see Appendix 6 Fig. 10). Disregarding certain fields of medical excellence in the US, one cannot overlook that the US health system is partly inefficient. It is quite strange that the number of gynecologists per women in the US is only one half that of the corresponding number for Germany. Moreover, an average clinical surgery in the US will cost three times as much as in the US (G\u00f6pffarth 2012, p. 30).If health care in the US is on average 35% more expensive than health care in Germany/France, there is a serious macroeconomic implication: Assuming that the share of US profits in US gross domestic product is 1/3rd - as is often assumed for western OECD countries \u2013 US exporters have a health cost related disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the Eurozone (Germany/France/Italy/Spain/Netherlands for simplicity) of (2/3rds) of 6% = 4%; inefficiencies in the US health system effectively amount to a 4% export tax. Indeed, in the US, health insurance for workers and employees is typically related \u2013 outside of Medicare for those aged 65 years and over, and the poor strata which get Medicare from government \u2013 to having a job so that the inefficiencies of the US health care system is equivalent to an export tax of the US of 4% (the health care-GDP ratio and the health insurance contribution rate, respectively, will raise the reservation wage in labor markets). The Trump Administration\u2019s debate about an excessive US trade balance deficit thus should start with taking stock of the inefficiencies of the US health care system and \u2013 related to this \u2013 the apparently enormous lobbying power of part of the US health sector and the lack of price transparency and competition in the hospital sector. By contrast, the health system of Singapore relies on a strict benchmarking of hospitals in Singapore, regardless whether those are private or publicly organized (for an overview of the Singaporean health system in comparison to the US, see US Commerical Service 2015).An epidemic affecting all major OECD countries would raise the health care expenditure cost relative to GDP in the US and in the Eurozone, namely through higher expenditures on the one hand and a lower GDP which will reduce due to a rising illness rate of the workforce. If there were to be a full-blown US (or EU) COVID-19 epidemic, hospital costs would increase strongly. As regards the United States, this could mean that the US comparative disadvantage in labor-intensive sectors \u2013 effectively also representing high health care costs \u2013 would further be reinforced and hence the US trade balance deficit-GDP ratio and the current account deficit-GDP ratio would rise.",

This at least points to the problem that the EU so far has not sufficiently considered a minimum level of health system quality as a requirement for EU membership; indeed including such a quality requirement in the Copenhagen Criteria II (an updated version of the Copenhagen Criteria) should be considered in the medium term by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council as well as the EU member countries.

A survey in the US found that medical bills are the most important cause of consumer bankruptcy \u2013 with 18\u201325% directly caused by medical debt cases (Austin 2014). In another survey, a key finding was that 56 million Americans under the age of 65 had trouble paying medical bills in 2013 (Lamontage 2014). 10 million American adults are expected to face problems with paying medical bills although they have year-round insurance (Lamontage 2014). For discussion of further aspects of health related to productivity aspects in the US, see DPE (2016).The COVID-19 epidemic is likely to create many additional health problems in the US; some patients might die, but most will, of course, survive \u2013 however, in many cases, high medical bills could be faced. In the US, the epidemic therefore could likely become an impulse for a decline of real per capita consumption, more so than in the Eurozone or the EU, respectively, where universal health coverage is common. One also has to anticipate that many people in the US will not undergo early testing for the coronavirus since they are afraid of high medical bills and this, in turn, will bring a higher mortality rate in the US than in the Eurozone. In the US, this could lead to a delayed epidemic which would lead to much higher health and output costs in the US than a European-type of broad health insurance system would imply. However, one may point out that a simple extension of Medicare options to individuals below 65 years of age will not solve the US health system inefficiencies alone; the question of how to organize more competition and incentives for healthier living (e.g. without the problem of obesity) as well as lobbying aspects would have to be considered. Econometric work that looks only at US health expenditures and not at the ratio of health expenditure to national income (or GDP) is often misleading for policy reforms.",

One may assume that the supply shock in the tradables sector has been relatively strong in the first half of March 2020 when production networks were distorted in the context of missing intermediate inputs from China (the epidemic in China still indirectly enforced firm shutdowns in the Chinese export sector until mid-March), but later, in the second half of March 2020, when government regulations in the EU countries closed the entertainment sector there was also a negative supply shock (a decline in AN) in the non-tradables sector.

This means that the projections of about 3% global growth from 2019 are no longer relevant and only about 1.4% global growth should be expected. Output growth could be further dampened if demand decline would be stronger than 40%. However, the dampening could be moderated if an international fall of the relative oil price would occur. Indeed world oil prices have decreased by about $15 per barrel between January 2, 2020, and March 2, 2020 (see Appendix 8 Fig. 11). On March 6, 2020, the Brent oil price stood at $45 per barrel but on March 9 it had already fallen to $31. It should be noted that an output decline of 1.6% in the US and in China would bring a spillover reduction of Eurozone/EU output by about 0.3%. Thus it holds: On top of the direct \u22121.6% of output growth in the EU, one should get an additional effect which brings an overall output decline of \u22121.9% compared to a baseline scenario. It will not be easy to adopt a compensating expansionary fiscal policy in EU countries and the EU, respectively. Moreover, it is clear that the shocks to international production networks cannot be healed by national fiscal policy, rather broad cooperation between the EU and Asian countries and the US could be useful here. Given the global excess supply in tradables world markets in 2020, the inflation rate in the Eurozone could fall to 1% in 2020. A decline in the inflation rate in combination with a year long depression in the tourism sector and serious problems in the air transportation and shipping sectors (e.g. cruise ships) could bring liquidity problems for a sizable number of firms \u2013 for a small number also solvency problems \u2013 so that higher spreads on corporate bonds and reduced loan growth of banks could dampen economic development.",

Individuals are typically assumed to maximize lifetime utility (and also typically, for the sake of simplicity, the time horizon is from 0 to infinity which takes away a core problem at the intersection of Economics and Health System analysis. A more realistic and relevant approach here could be to assume that the typical household maximizes utility U which is a function of the quality of life \u2013 proxied by h \u2013 and the log of consumption C(t) as stated in the subsequent simple approach. The expected lifetime T \u2013 relevant for the time horizon over which the maximization of consumption takes place - is a positive function of h; a broader health insurance will bring about a better average quality of life and quality of consumption, respectively. This aspects makes the problem setting more realistic and also more difficult to analyze (households consider here discounted \u201ceffective consumption\u201d which is assumed to be represented by h lnC(t) e\u2019-rt (see eq. (4); e\u2019 is the Euler number, r the real interest rate). The setting is rather compact if h is assumed to be constant over time (see eq. (5)); in a broader approach, one will have to make an explicit distinction between h and individual health quality h\u201di). Even then, two neighboring countries will have migration \u2013 say between Mexico and the US or Eastern Europe plus Africa and Western Europe \u2013 because there are cross-country differences in h; the average health status in California/Texas, and possibly the whole US, is higher than in Mexico. Not only is the difference in consumption C between two countries considered relevant, but the variable h could indeed also be considered in international migration analysis. The relevance of h and health quality, respectively, can be pointed out through the subsequent graph.4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ U=\\underset{0}{\\overset{T(h)}{\\int }}h\\ln C(t)e{\\hbox{'}}^{- rt} dt $$\\end{document}U=\u222b0ThhlnCte'\u2212rtdt5\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ U=h\\underset{0}{\\overset{T(h)}{\\int }}\\ln C(t)e{\\hbox{'}}^{- rt} dt $$\\end{document}U=h\u222b0ThlnCte'\u2212rtdt",

This implies that the COVID-19 challenge for the US could have strong political implications in the field of transatlantic economic relations; and the envisaged EU-UK free trade agreement would certainly look different if the EU is in a relatively strong position vis-\u00e1-vis the UK compared to the alternative setting where the position of the Johnson government is quite strong due to political backing of an anti-EU oriented newly re-elected Trump. For the EU, there is no reason not to push for a final EU-UK negotiation round in mid-November 2020. Beyond such medium-term perspectives, there are more long run questions raised by the COVID-19 epidemic.",

            "text": "An epidemic can obviously affect not only cyclical output developments in the medium term but also long run economic development; that is economic growth. Here, a brief look at an adequately modified rather simple neoclassical model setting can be useful. One crucial issue concerns the question of health insurance coverage (h) and its effect on potential output and economic welfare, respectively. In this section, only a few aspects can be analyzed, namely to what extent an epidemic \u2013 or waves of epidemics \u2013 could affect the long run level of the growth path and the growth rate of per capita income (y) in the steady state (read: In the very long run). For simplicity, a crucial aspect has to be ignored here, namely that typically a higher health insurance coverage will raise life expectancy; an important issue for which western EU countries and the US provide relevant evidence. One may also point out here that a traditional modern growth modeling approach amounts to ignoring this crucial aspect, namely by assuming that households are maximizing utility (depending on per capita consumption C/L) in an approach with an infinite time horizon. This infinite time horizon is a way to simplify some of the task of modelling; however, it amounts to ignoring that the length of a lifetime is an endogenous variable. From this perspective, my emphasis on a systemic comparison of social market economies in Western Europe and the US is rather adequate, namely to calculate effective lifetime per capita consumption or effective lifetime per capita income \u2013 and here the figures for Germany and France are indeed equal to the US value (Welfens 2019); but the western European countries have the additional advantage that infant mortality is lower than in the US (one could argue that risk averse individuals/parents would thus have a preference for living in Germany/France). As regards the link between health and growth, there is a rather limited range of contributions, which includes, for example, models which consider environmental shocks/health shocks and growth (Bretschger and Vinogradova 2017, 2019). Economic growth models can also integrate endogenous population growth (Bretschger 2019). The subsequent approach is a rather compact modified Solow model with health insurance and the role of health in terms of effective labor input in an open economy with foreign direct investment (FDI). There is asymmetric FDI, namely only inward FDI. Foreign investors will be assumed to invest part of the profits made in foreign subsidiaries in the host country; \u00df is the share of profits in GDP in the host country and \u03b1*\u00dfY is profits of subsidiaries in country 1. The health coverage ratio (h) is considered to be a proxy for the health status of the representative worker.",

Assuming that broader health insurance is associated with better health and that health represents an implicit consumption good, this formulation of the enhanced growth model is adequate. If, however, one holds the view that health is rather a kind of investment good, one may note that it would be possible to additionally consider the equilibrium condition for the goods markets as S = dK/dt + d\u2019K + E\u201dh where h is health insurance coverage and E\u201d is the average real per capita expenditure on health while E\u201d = e\u201dZ (Z is real national income; 0 < e\u201d < 1; E\u201d thus is assumed to be proportionate to real gross national income Z.

The main interest here is to consider a potential trade-off between the effect of a higher h on the level of the growth path and the growth rate of per capita income in the steady state on the one hand; on the other hand, it is interesting to consider the long-term impact of an epidemic shock which will be considered as affecting both the quasi-exogenous growth rate of knowledge (a) and the quasi-exogenous growth rate of the population (n). Just as the massive impact of the Transatlantic Banking Crisis of 2008/09 brought about a downward permanent shift of the level of the growth path of many OECD countries, the global coronavirus shock could bring about a downward shift of the path of the global growth rate; or \u2013 as considered here \u2013 potentially also a change in the long run growth rate.",

This needs more attention in future research and policy: As the health insurance expenditure-GDP ratio positively affects effective labor input and hence GDP, a rise of the health insurance coverage (h) affects both the numerator and the denominator of that ratio.

EU countries with very broad health insurance coverage might not see much change in their respective health insurance systems but rather police holders will enjoy a higher post-pandemic consumer rent as the implicit demand for health insurance becomes larger; private health insurance might benefit from this effect in the EU. In the US and many developing countries, as well as newly industrializing countries, the demand for health insurance could considerably rise in the medium term. As a final interesting structural shift effect, one may anticipate that the epidemic-imposed massive switch to more home office work could have a ratchet effect so that the post-pandemic demand for office space will decline (beyond the negative output-related effect) which will reduce the relative price for office buildings worldwide.

As regards cooperation among countries, this seems to be rather difficult and the Eurozone countries obviously had particular problems in finding agreement as to the degree to which strong cooperation and possibly the use of Eurobonds should be considered. Traditionally, there is resistance to Eurobonds in northern Eurozone countries, including Germany, while southern Eurozone countries \u2013 including Italy and Spain as countries rather strongly affected by the coronavirus shock in terms of a high case fatality rate \u2013 would rather push for this new option. As one can show, however, the coronavirus epidemic, coupled with a strong recession in the EU, the US and other countries, does not stand for the traditional Eurobond debate and the associated political setting: A key question concerns the extent to which such bonds could be launched with partial underlying collateral through gold and currency reserves in order to limit the liability risk of partner countries with rather low debt-GDP ratios (e.g. Germany or the Netherlands) and then about 40% of such Joint Eurobonds \u2013 JEBs \u2013 could be acquired by, say, the European Central Bank through its new pandemic quantitative easing program; such an approach, coupled with a special wealth taxation in Italy and Spain to make sure that the interest and principal of bonds can be paid without problems, should indeed be considered carefully as only this approach would firmly help to avoid a new Euro crisis and could mitigate an otherwise extremely negative economic shock in Italy and Spain (WELFENS 2020). Mitigating the economic shock in the first half of 2020 and making sure that a broad and sustained restart of the economies in Europe, Northern America and Asia and other world regions take place represent significant challenges for policymakers. As long as no vaccination is available, temporary lockdowns and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d periods will have to be used by certain countries such that a broad and strong international restart could prove difficult. It might also turn out to be the first major international crisis after 1945 without US leadership in fighting the crisis; a potential problem which I had pointed to previously \u2013 the lack of qualified staff in the Trump Administration is critical (WELFENS 2019). The US is the only OECD country where millions of people stand to lose not only their job in the recession but also their health insurance \u2013 in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic; one more reason to consider reforms in the US.",
