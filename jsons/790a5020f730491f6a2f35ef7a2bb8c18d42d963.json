The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called transfer learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The dataset utilized in this experiment is a collection of 1427 X-Ray images. 224 images with confirmed Covid-19, 700 images with confirmed common pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions are included. The data was collected from the available X-Ray images on public medical repositories. With transfer learning, an overall accuracy of 97.82% in the detection of Covid-19 is achieved.",

Please note that TP refers to the correctly predicted Covid-19 cases, FP refers to typical or pneumonia cases that were classified as Covid-19 by the CNN, TN refers to normal or pneumonia cases that were classified as non-Covid-19 cases, while the FN refers to Covid-19 cases classified as normal or as common pneumonia cases. Due to the fact that the main intention of the study is the detection of Covid-19, we measure two different accuracies. The first accuracy refers to the overall accuracy of the model in distinguishing the three classes (normal-pneumonia-Covid) and is called 3-class accuracy. The second accuracy refers to the accuracy related to Covid-19 only. That is, if an instance is typical and is classified as pneumonia by the CNN, it is still considered acceptable in terms of the presence of Covid-19. The aforementioned accuracy is called 2-class accuracy.",

Due to the imbalance of the dataset, all the CNNs perform seemingly well in terms of accuracy and in terms of specificity. However, as those metrics depend heavily on the number of samples representing each class, their unilateral evaluation leads to incorrect conclusions. For this reason, the combination of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity must be the criterion for choosing the best model. The measurements denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 2 , indicate that these values are not considered acceptable in real-life problems, due to the above issue.",
