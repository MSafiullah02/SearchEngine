During the first few months of 2005, a large outbreak of filoviral-like hemorrhagic fever began in the Uige Province in northern Angola. The immediate thought was that this outbreak was likely to have been caused by EBOV because of the geographic proximity to past outbreaks of EBOV infection, coupled with the apparent high case-fatality rates. However, early in 2005, this outbreak was found to be caused by a new strain of MARV (MARV Angola [MARV-Ang]), with 227 deaths recorded among 252 case patients [8] . The reasons for the increased lethality of this new strain of MARV are presently unknown but are of significant concern.",

For Zaire EBOV (ZEBOV), we previously showed that the procoagulant tissue factor (TF) contributes to developing coagulopathy [9] and that recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), an inhibitor of the TF pathway, provided partial postexposure protection to rhesus macaques [10] . Survival and prolongation of disease course in these rNAPc2-treated animals was associated with attenuation of the coagulation and proinflammatory responses. Animals responding to treatment showed reduced plasma levels of d-dimers, less-prominent fibrin deposits in tissues, and lower plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. rNAPc2 also was shown to dampen the proinflammatory response in cases of human endotoxemia [11] and in healthy human subjects in whom coagulation was deliberately provoked by a stimulant [12] . The antithrombotic potential of rNAPc2 has been demonstrated in phase II trials in the clinical settings of orthopedic surgery [13] and coronary revascularization [14] . In this study, we evaluated the pathogenicity of MARV-Ang in rhesus macaques and also assessed the efficacy of rNAPc2 against this new MARV strain.",

An initial study was performed to confirm the virulence of MARV-Ang. In this first study, 3 macaques (control animals 1-3) were inoculated, by intramuscular injection, with 1000 pfu of MARV-Ang (provided by P. Rollin, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). The MARV-Ang strain used was originally obtained in 2005 from serum samples from a fatally infected human [15] and was passed twice in Vero cells. After the initial study to confirm the virulence of MARV-Ang, the second study evaluated the utility of rNAPc2 as a postexposure treatment modality. The regimen followed was identical to that described elsewhere for ZEBOV infection [10] . In brief, 9 animals were exposed to 1000 pfu of MARV-Ang by means of intramuscular injection. Of these 9 animals, 6 animals (subjects 1-6) were treated with rNAPc2 by subcutaneous injection (\u223c30 mg/kg body weight, once daily; obtained previously from Corvas International), beginning \u223c10 min after viral challenge and continuing to 14 days after exposure to MARV-Ang. Three macaques served as experimental control animals (4-6) and received an equivalent volume of sterile PBS in accordance with the same regimen used for the rNAPc2-treated animals. Blood samples were collected before challenge and on days 3, 6, 10, and 14 after challenge; blood samples also were collected at the time of death, when possible.",

Results of previous studies that used other strains of MARV for infection of rhesus macaques and similar experimental conditions (i.e., subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of doses estimated to be between 500 and 10,000 pfu) have suggested that most rhesus macaques should begin showing clinical evidence of infection around day 4 or 5 and usually die between days 9 and 12 after challenge [6, 18, 22] . However, in this initial pilot study, disease appeared to progress more rapidly: all 3 animals began to show clinical signs of illness by day 3 (table  1) . Characteristic features of MARV infection, including fever, cutaneous rashes, lymphopenia, and/or elevations in circulating levels of enzymes associated with organ dysfunction, were prominent in all animals by day 6. Thrombocytopenia, which is a prominent feature of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in nonhuman primates [9, 10, 19, 23, 24] , was not as prevalent in these animals. However, modest declines in levels of platelets (by 30%-40%), which is consistent with findings in other MARV studies of macaques [22] , were seen at day 6 after infection. Decreases in plasma levels of protein C and concomitant increases in plasma levels of d-dimers were observed in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques but did not appear to be as marked as previously described for ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10] . Increased levels of TF transcripts were detected in PBMCs of the MARV-Ang-infected macaques but appeared to develop later in the disease course than has been reported for ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10] . All 3 of the MARV-infected animals succumbed to challenge; 1 macaque died on day 7 (control animal 2) and 2 macaques died on day 8 (control animals 1 and 3).",

However, the liver appeared to be a bit more affected by MARV-Ang (higher organ infectivity titers and more evidence of necrosis and inflammation) than has been observed in MARV Musoke-infected animals (T.W.G., unpublished data) and much more involved than the liver in ZEBOV-infected macaques [19, 23] . In brief, the livers were severely reticulated and discolored ( figure 1A) . Histologic findings included some hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, with occasional neutrophilic and monocytic inflammation (figure 1B), in most of these animals. Although there is a significant paucity of immunohistochemical data from tissues of humans and nonhuman primates infected with MARV, the distribution of antigen in these macaques was consistent with findings reported for a human case of MARV infection (strain Ravn) [28] . Immunohistochemical staining for MARV antigens was particularly prominent in the liver ( figure  1C ) and splenic red pulp of all the animals. Similarly, organ infectivity titration showed that the liver and spleen had particularly high loads of infectious MARV-Ang, with mean titers of 9.1 and 8.8 log 10 pfu/g, respectively, for untreated control animals. Mean organ infectivity titers for MARV-Ang in other tissues ranged from 5.3 to 8.4 log 10 pfu/g (data not shown). Immunopositive staining was prominent in hepatocytes ( figure  1C ) and Kupffer cells in liver and also in monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts in most tissues examined. In addition, some animals showed other lesions consistent with findings for the human case of MARV infection, including viral infection of adrenal cortical and medullary cells ( figure 1D ) and pancreatic islet cells ( figure 1E ).",

Consistent with the results from our pilot experiment, all 3 macaques treated with placebo in this study died on day 7 after MARV-Ang challenge. In contrast, 1 of the rNAPc2-treated animals (subject 3) survived MARV-Ang challenge, whereas the remaining 5 rNAPc2treated animals all died on day 9 (figure 2A). The animal that survived challenge has remained healthy for more than 1 year. The mean survival time for the 5 rNAPc2-treated animals that succumbed to MARV-Ang challenge was 9.0 days, compared with 7.3 days for the cohort of 6 control animals; this nearly 2-day prolongation in survival of the rNAPc2-treated macaques was statistically significant ( ). P p .0005 By day 6 after challenge, animals in the rNAPc2-treated group showed clinical features of MARV infection that were consistent with those of the control animals (table 1). The primary difference between the groups was the slower development of macular rashes in the rNAPc2-treated animals versus the control animals ( figure 3) . Results for MARV-Ang plasma viremia are summarized in figure 2B . All animals became viremic, with little difference observed between the cohort of the 5 rNAPc2-treated animals that died and the control animals. The animal that survived (subject 3) had much lower plasma viremia than did any of the other animals, with levels in subject 3 never exceeding 3.0 log 10 pfu/mL; subject 3 became aviremic by day 14. In comparison, plasma viremia in the cohort of 5 rNAPc2-treated nonsurvivors and the control animals exceeded 8.0 log 10 pfu/mL by day 6.",

During the height of this outbreak, interest in evaluating the potential of rNAPc2 as a postexposure treatment for MHF was expressed by a number of international health care organizations. This interest was driven by studies of rhesus macaques that showed that the TF-pathway inhibitor rNAPc2 had some postexposure efficacy against EHF and because rNAPc2 has been safely used in a variety of medical applications [13, 14] . In the current proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the efficacy of rNAPc2 as a postexposure treatment for MARV-Ang hemorrhagic fever by administering rNAPc2 to rhesus macaques shortly after challenge with MARV-Ang. The results of this study (17% survival; 1.7-day increase in mean time to death) were not as impressive as the results obtained in studies of ZEBOV-infected rhesus macaques treated with rNAPc2 (33% survival; 3.4-day increase in mean time to death), even though the study design was identical. Nonetheless, survival and a beneficial effect were achieved in an otherwise uniformly lethal model of virus challenge.",

TF was up-regulated in the MARV-Anginfected macaques; however, levels of TF were not as striking as those noted in ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10] . Differ- ences in levels of TF may have contributed to the reduced efficacy of rNAPc2 in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques, compared with ZEBOV-infected macaques. rNAPc2 acts by inhibiting the TF/factor VIIa pathway; thus, if TF is not as important in the developing coagulopathy of MARV-Ang infection in macaques, then blocking the TF pathway may not have as much of an impact on mitigating the disease. Further studies are needed in order to systematically dissect these differences in TF production.",

In particular, the deposition of polymerized fibrin, which is a prominent pathologic finding in tissues of ZEBOV-infected macaques [9, 10, 23] , was less frequently observed in tissues of the MARV-Anginfected macaques. Further differences include the degree of hepatocyte infection and of necrosis and inflammation of the liver, which were more prominent in the MARV-Ang-infected animals than has been reported for ZEBOV-infected macaques. In fact, mean virus titers in the livers of the MARV-Ang-infected macaques exceeded 9.0 log 10 pfu/g, which is nearly 2.0 log 10 pfu/g more than that typically seen in EBOV-infected macaques [19, 33] . In the MARV-Ang-infected macaques, the coagulation disorders may have been exacerbated more by the decreased synthesis of coagulation proteins, due to severe hepatocellular necrosis, than by thrombocytopenia or induction of the TF pathway of blood coagulation. rNAPc2 has no known ability to protect hepatocyte function, so the lower efficacy of rNAPc2 against MARV-Ang infection may be related to the increased liver damage seen in the MARV-Ang-infected macaques, versus that seen in ZEBOV-infected macaques.",

One consideration regarding our studies of macaques is the passage history of the virus strain used in this study, versus the passage history of MARV strains used in other studies. The passage history of MARV-Ang is low (i.e., 2 passages from human serum). The best direct comparison is to the Ravn strain of MARV, which also has a low passage history (2 passages from human serum), as shown when injected into 3 rhesus macaques [6] . In the study of MARV Ravn, which used a higher challenge dose of 10,000 pfu, 1 of 3 animals survived; the other animals died on days 8 and 11 after challenge.

This finding is consistent with the survival of rNAPc2-treated, ZEBOV-infected macaques [10] and with ZEBOV-infected macaques treated with recombinant human activated protein C [40] .
