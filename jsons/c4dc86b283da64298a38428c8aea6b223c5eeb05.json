            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that there is a loss of smell in many patients, including in infected but otherwise asymptomatic individuals. The underlying mechanisms for the olfactory symptoms are unclear. Using a mouse model, we determined whether cells in the olfactory epithelium express the obligatory receptors for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by using RNAseq, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons. These data suggest that sustentacular cells are involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and impairment of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients. We also show that expression of the entry proteins increases in animals of old age. This may explain, if true also in humans, why individuals of older age are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "R ecent reports indicate that partial loss of the sense of smell or even total anosmia are early markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1,2 However, the cellular mechanisms of this phenomenon are unknown. Transient impairment of olfaction may be caused by two different types of processes: inflammation in the olfactory epithelium or damage to the olfactory receptor neurons. The latter possibility should be considered because SARS-CoV virus can infect olfactory neurons, followed by axonal transport of the virus to the brain in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 protein. 3 If the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus indeed gains access to the olfactory pathway, with the potential of subsequent brain infection, 4,5 then one would expect that cells in the olfactory epithelium express proteins that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus entry. This is currently not known but could be relevant for efforts to identify tissues that have a large viral load and are more sensitive for virus detection in infected but asymptomatic individuals. 6 It is known that SARS-CoV-2 virus invades human cells via the obligatory receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), and that viral uptake is further facilitated by a priming protease, TMPRSS2. 7, 8 Cells with high ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression have strong virus binding capacity and are particularly susceptible to infection. 9 Identifying the relevant cell types is essential to determine the mechanism of hyposmia and anosmia observed in a significant fraction of COVID-19 patients and in otherwise asymptomatic carriers, as we have previously emphasized. 6 While large-scale transcriptome studies have examined gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of various species, it is currently controversial whether neuronal or non-neuronal cells in the olfactory epithelium express the obligatory receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and whether expression levels differ with age. 10\u221219 By using RNAseq, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry in a murine olfactory model system, we here identify sustentacular cells as the cell type with high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, thus indicating that these cells may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus in the human olfactory epithelium. Because sustentacular cells play key roles in supporting olfactory neuron metabolism and odor sensing, 20 we propose that damage caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to sustentacular cells may lead to the olfactory deficits observed in COVID-19 patients.",

However, one microarray study did not find ACE2 expressed in the OE. 10 Several studies report that ACE2 expression is likely in non-neuronal cells rather than in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), 12\u221214 based on very low or lack of ACE2 expression in isolated mature ORNs yet positive expression in whole OE, but again one microarray study did not find ACE2 enriched in non-neuronal cells of the OE. 11 Technical factors could contribute to these discrepancies, 21 since RNAseq data can only provide predictions that require independent experimental validation. 15 Our own data obtained by RNAseq expression profiling shows ACE2 expression within the OE in young and aged mice without Expression profiling from adult to aged animals shows similar levels for ACE2 (p > 0.05) but a significant increase for TMPRSS2 (p < 0.05). Data are based on three independent libraries prepared from OE of three male mice for each age (GEO accession GSE147771). FPKM: fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million mapped reads. Figure 1 . Gene expression analysis by RT-PCR for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in murine olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory bulb (OB), and frontal cortex (FC) at different ages. Relative expression levels were normalized to expression in 2 month old OE (100%) using GAPDH as housekeeping gene. Similar results were obtained with \u03b2-actin as the housekeeping gene. (A) Relative expression of ACE2 in OE decreases from juvenile 1 month old (1MO) to 2 month old (2MO), but it is stable in 2 year old (2YO). (B, C) ACE2 levels observed in OB and FC are lower as compared to OE and stable during aging. Note that OE has higher expression level than OB and FC at each stage analyzed. (D) For TMPRSS2, much higher expression was detected in OE as compared to OB (E) and FC (F). Note that with aging the level of TMPRSS2 increases significantly in OE but not in OB or FC. (G) Expression of another protease, TMPRSS4, in OE significantly decreases during aging. (H) Lower expression of ACE2 was noted in OE of female as compared to male 2 month old mice. (I) TMPRSS2 expression in OE did not show gender-specific differences. All graphs give the mean values, and error bars represent \u00b1 SEM. *P \u2264 0.01, **P \u2264 0.005, ***P \u2264 0.001. Analysis of previous RNAseq data indicate neuronal and non-neuronal expression of TMPRSS2 in the OE, 12,13 except for one study which did not find TMPRSS2 expressed in OE. 14 The levels of TMPRSS2 expression in non-neuronal OE cells seem to be higher than that in ORNs, 10, 13 but different subpopulations of mature ORNs appear to differ in their levels of TMPRSS2; 13 such a mosaic expression pattern is not typical for the majority of other ORN genes. Our own RNAseq profiling in murine OE readily detected expression of TMPRSS2, and its levels were higher as compared to ACE2 (GEO accession number GSE147771). TMPRSS2 expression increased with old age (Table 1) .",

Expression of ACE2 was significantly lower in the brain as compared to OE, and low levels in the olfactory bulb and frontal cortex did not change with age ( Figure 1B , C).

Our data suggest that the OE of older mice (and, if true for humans, also older humans) may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than younger ages.",

We used immunocytochemistry to localize ACE2 protein.

            "text": "Our single-labeling experiments suggest that sustentacular cells contain most of the ACE2 protein in the OE, consistent with RNAseq data showing that neuronal expression of ACE2 is unlikely. The non-neuronal expression of ACE2 is not surprising, since transcriptome data for cerebral cortex indicated that ACE2 was expressed mostly by endothelial cells and astrocytes, but not by neurons. 22 However, others reported that ACE2 is also distributed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies. 23, 24 In order to clarify whether ACE2 protein is present in dendrites and cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), we performed double labeling experiments with a marker for mature ORNs, olfactory marker protein (OMP). Double labeling shows that the majority of ACE2 signal is located within the layer of sustentacular cells, adjacent to the OMP signal, just below the heavily OMP-labeled ORN knobs and Figure 4A , B, D and E, F, H). Although it is possible that rare microvillar cells also express ACE2, we conclude that, in the OE, ACE2 protein is located mainly in the sustentacular cells but not in the ORN cilia. This finding is significant, because sustentacular cells are exposed to a hostile external environment and thus they are accessible to airborne pathogens including viruses. Sustentacular cells support ORN function by releasing odor-binding proteins and endocytosing olfactory binding protein\u2212odorant complexes 25 and therefore may compromise olfaction when infected by viruses. In the olfactory bulb, ACE2 was localized mostly in mitral cells, and no or very low signal was detected in glomeruli or periglomerular interneurons ( Figure 4I\u2212L) . Intriguingly, some dendritic localization of ACE2 was visible in mitral cells ( Figure 4I , L). This suggests that some distinct neuronal populations in the brain may contain ACE2, as was earlier observed by others. 22, 23 Recent RNAseq studies of respiratory epithelium in the human nasal cavity did not detect clear ACE2 signals, 16, 26 while single cell RNAseq in human respiratory epithelium did show ACE2 expression. 17 We detected ACE2 protein in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity, however, with a Figure 5E ). To localize TMPRSS2 expression in the OE, we used in situ hybridization, because available antibodies produced high background label. As shown in Figure 5H \u2212J, TMPRSS2 transcripts were present in the sustentacular cells and also in deeper layers of the OE, which includes immature ORNs and stem cells, but label was low or nonexistent in mature ORNs. This localization clarifies previous controversies about TMPRSS2 expression in the OE, 10\u221212,14,18 by confirming low expression in mature ORNs. 18 TMPRSS2 expression in deeper layers of the OE is consistent with some of the RNAseq studies. 10, 11, 18 In summary, our mouse model shows that, with older age, amounts of ACE2 protein increase in the OE, as does gene expression of TMPRSS2, the two SARS-CoV-2 host receptors. This may explain why animals (and humans) are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection when they reach old age. 27 In mice, we have identified the sustentacular cells as the cell type in the OE which expresses both SARS-CoV-2 host receptors required for cell entry. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulates in sustentacular cells first and, by interfering with their metabolism, affects the function of olfactory receptor neurons. The damage to these cells caused by the virus may impair smell sensation as is often observed in COVID-19 patients. Whether the virus may be transferred from sustentacular cells to olfactory receptor neurons requires further studies. The dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons are enwrapped by sustentacular cells, and such contacts may engage in cross-communication by exosomes. 28 Herpes viruses can hijack host exosomes to infect neighboring cells. 29 Therefore, further investigations are needed to verify the sustentacular cells as a primary SARS-CoV-2 target in the human OE and to examine whether the virus can pass from sustentacular cells to olfactory neurons with a potential route to infect the brain. An additional important finding of our work is that the murine OE contains a more intense accumulation of ACE2 protein than the respiratory epithelium. If this is true for the human OE, then the OE (and specifically the sustentacular cells) rather than the respiratory epithelium may be most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for this reason it may be the most relevant source of tissues to detect COVID-19 infection in early stages and in asymptomatic carriers. This could reduce the rate of false negative tests in early and in asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.",

(A) One or more bands just above 100 kDa are visible which are more intense in aged olfactory epithelium (OE) (2YO) than in 2 month old (2MO). In contrast, in olfactory bulb (OB) and frontal cortex (FC), ACE2 bands are weaker and decrease with age. GAPDH verifies similar loading per lane. (B) Quantification of the relative band intensity shows significant increase of ACE2 in aged OE but not in aged OB and cortex (CT). Intensity of ACE2 band for 2MO FC was set at 100%.

A thin layer of labeling is visible at the luminal surface of the OE (A, D). Higher magnification shows labeling just above the layer of sustentacular cell nuclei (D\u2212F), while the olfactory knobs and cilia (red arrows) do not contain ACE2, and neither do the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN, asterisks in D and F). (C, F) Merging of the images from (A) and (B) as well as (D) and (E) reveals that the cell bodies of the sustentacular cells (SC) contain most of the ACE2 label. ACE2 label was weaker in the RE of the nasal cavity (G\u2212I). In the OB, ACE2 antibodies labeled some mitral cells, including their proximal dendrites (J\u2212L, arrows).
