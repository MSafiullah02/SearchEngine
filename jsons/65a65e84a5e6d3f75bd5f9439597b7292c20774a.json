A similar event is experienced by some healthcare systems regularly, due to for instance seasonal spikes in the number of patients. We model this as a queueing system in heavy traffic (where the arrival rate is approaching the service rate from below) or in overload (where the arrival rate exceeds the service rate). In both cases we assume that customers (patients) may have different priorities and we consider two popular service disciplines: static priorities and accumulating priorities. It has been shown that the latter allows for patients of all classes to be seen in a timely manner as long as the system is stable. We demonstrate however that if accumulating priorities are used in the heavy traffic or overload regime, then all patients, including those with the highest priority, will experience very long waiting times. If on the other hand static priorities are applied, then one can ensure that the highest-priority patients will be seen in a timely manner even in overloaded systems.",

Healthcare services are also under increasing pressure as demographics change and populations age. Public health services are struggling, and sometimes failing, to maintain services under this increasing load. Given this context of high demand for tightly constrained resources it is instructive to reassess the rationales for prioritization regimes currently in use, and contrast with other possibilities. Specifically, in this paper we characterize the performance of the very commonly used static priority regime, and contrast it with the recently proposed accumulating priority regime, under critical loadings.",

In a static priority regime, patients are assigned to a priority class, and must wait to be treated until all patients in higher priority classes have been treated. Patients may sometimes be moved to a higher priority class if their condition deteriorates, but in practice there is often no automatic mechanism for making such transitions, and any adjustments may rely on patients proactively approaching their healthcare provider. Accumulating priority queues (APQs) have recently been proposed to overcome some of the inherent drawbacks of static priority queues in healthcare [13] . In accumulating priority queues, patients accumulate priority with time spent in the queue, at a rate that depends on their priority class, with higher priority patients accumulating priority faster than lower priority patients. Priority can accumulate linearly, or in a nonlinear fashion. Observational studies of behaviour in emergency departments have revealed that in practice physicians may operate a regime that is similar to an APQ, with the likelihood of being seen increasing more rapidly as waiting times approach threshold targets, see e.g. [5] .",

The heavy traffic regime has been intensively studied, although not for the accumulating priority queue. When \u03c1 > 1 queues are overloaded and hence unstable, and no equilibrium exists. Unstable queues, if unchecked, grow without bound, which is unrealistic for almost every application, and of course, an infinite queue never exists in practice. However, there are many applications where arrival rates are greater than service rates for shorter or longer periods. Traffic networks are an immediate example. In many cities rush hour queues build up, and then decay, not because the system can cope with the increased volume of traffic but simply because the flow into the network has reduced as rush hour passes.",

Emergency departments may also see increased demand due to patients who could have been treated by their GP, but were deterred by cost (e.g. in New Zealand, where hospital visits in the public health system are free, but GP visits are not), or long waiting times for GP appointments. No patient arriving in a period when \u03c1 > 1 actually sees an infinite queue -rather they see a large, possibly very large, queue ahead of them. Their waiting time for treatment, given they have joined the queue, is also not infinite, but as a patient's condition deteriorates, it may nevertheless be far too long. In practice also, if \u03c1 is close to 1, then over relatively short periods of time it may be difficult to determine whether \u03c1 < 1 or \u03c1 > 1. Thus there is a strong practical need to address the question of how best to organize patient prioritization in this transient regime.",

On the other hand, if \u03c1 \u2191 1 or \u03c1 > 1, then it is impossible to limit waiting times for all patients, and the static priority regime provides a mechanism for ensuring that healthcare is still available to the most acute, and vulnerable, patients (see Fig. 2 below), whereas under APQ the expected waiting times for all classes increase ( Fig. 1 below) . For this scenario we propose below a mixture of the two prioritization schemes. Section 2 gives a detailed description of the models we consider. Section 3 considers the case where \u03c1 = 1 \u2212 , as \u2193 0, while Section 4 considers the case where \u03c1 > 1. In Section 5 we discuss issue related to customers making strategic decisions.

This is similar to the behaviour in heavy traffic of the MaxWeight protocol (see [14] ) which equates scaled queue lengths (we discuss this connection further below).",

We can also see from proposed solution is applied, the sample path looks similar to that of the system with static priorities. A further example (see figure 4) illustrates how by changing the priority regime one can avoid long waiting times for high-priority customers if there is a sudden surge of lowerpriority customers. There are, as before, three priority classes, \u03bb 1 = \u03bb 2 = 1/3 for the entire simulation. In the first quarter of the simulation time \u03bb 3 = 1/3 \u2212 0.3, so the total load of the system is 0.7, the system is in relatively light traffic and the accumulating priorities are used. All queue lengths are small. In the second quarter of the simulation time the arrival rate of the low priority customers suddenly jumps (this could represent for instance seasonal effects) to \u03bb 3 = 1/3 \u2212 10 \u22123 , so the total load in the system is 1 \u2212 10 \u22123 and the system is in heavy traffic.

In particular, as R in the healthcare context is typically extremely high-especially in life-threatening situations and expensive elective procedures-so are the expected waiting times.

Taking into account that patients react strategically leads to the following conclusion. If there exist an alternative to class N + 1 patients at a reasonable price R, their effective arrival rate will stop growing at some point, and their, as well as all the other classes' waiting times will remain finite, even when AP are used. Thus, by creating such an alternative (e.g., in the form of reasonably priced private treatment), the effect of high loads are moderated.

A variant of static priorities has been considered in [2] and a version of accumulating priorities -in [3] . Few people would disagree with the observation that at least at some points in our lives we all experience an overload of our to-do lists. This may be modelled as the arrival rate being (perhaps temporarily) close to, or even above, the completion rate, exactly the settings considered in this paper. Our results can therefore be interpreted as follows: when the number of tasks on the to-do list grows, if time-dependent priorities are used, the number of outstanding high-importance tasks will grow. In order to prevent this, either static priorities, or a combination of accumulating and static priorities suggested here, should be used.",

A simple version of it may be described as follows: there are a number of queues, each with its own exogenous stream of arriving jobs, and a single server which, upon completing a job, chooses the next one to perform from the queue with the largest number of outstanding jobs. Other priorities have also been discussed, in particular weighted queue lengths. If one views our model as tasks from the same class forming a queue, then in the case of accumulating priorities the server chooses the next task from the queue with the highest weighted waiting time of the longest-waiting task. Situations considered in this paper are such that the numbers of outstanding tasks in all queues grow to infinity. In this case, the waiting time of the longest-waiting customer is proportional to the number of outstanding tasks. Therefore, in the regimes considered here, the behaviour of the accumulating-priority queue is the same as that of the system governed by an appropriately weighted MaxWeight algorithm.",
