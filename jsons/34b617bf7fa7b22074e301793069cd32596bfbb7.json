A recombinant secretory IgA (SIgA) against Streptococcus mutans has been approved in Europe for topical administration to prevent dental caries (Ma et al., 1998) . Antitransferrin IgA has been shown to be effective against cancers when administered intravenously (Brooks et al., 1995) . However, topical administration of an anti-RSV IgA did not show significant efficacy as a prophylactic agent in clinical trials, although an IgG anti-RSV has been shown to be effective when administered intramuscularly and is approved by the FDA for use in humans (Subramanian et al., 1998) . Thus, although there is much potential for IgA-based therapeutic and prophylactic agents, it is essential to use recombinant antibody technology to define the correlations between IgA structure and function, to study the biology of IgA and determine the mechanisms by which IgA and SIgA provide protection. This knowledge will facilitate the design and production of effective IgA-based immunotherapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

A decision must be made as to which IgA form is most appropriate for the intended application. Like IgG, production of IgA requires the expression of heavy and light chains. However, to make polymeric IgA (pIgA) a third chain, the J-chain, must also be expressed. If SIgA is needed, a fourth polypeptide, SC, must also be expressed. These chains must be appropriately assembled and secreted. IgA is a glycoprotein with two to five N-linked glycans present on the heavy chain; O-Linked glycans are present in the hinge region of IgA1. The N-linked glycans present on the \u03b1-heavy-chain are exposed on the surface of the molecule (Mattu et al., 1998; Merry et al., 1992) . The J-chain and SC are also glycoproteins. Because glycans on IgA play an important role in its function, particular attention must be paid to the structure of the glycans attached by different expression systems. The cost of the product is also an important consideration. Thus, the identification of the appropriate expression system is a significant challenge when producing recombinant IgA.",

Each system has its advantages, limitations, and potential applications. Large quantities of proteins can be produced in insect cells and in agricultural amounts in plants, making these expression systems an economical alternative to producing therapeutic and diagnostic reagents. Normal posttranslational modifications such as signal peptide cleavage, intrachain and interchain disulfide bond formation, and the addition of O-linked and N-linked carbohydrates are observed in plant and insect cells. However, the N-glycans attached by insect and plant cells differ from those normally found on human IgA (Butters et al., 1981; Jarvis and Finn, 1995 Martin et al., 1988 Ogonah et al., 1995) . The N-glycans present on IgA produced in transgenic animals will depend on the species used. These differences in glycosylation might influence in vivo biologic properties such as biodistribution, half-life, and effector functions. Intact and fully assembled IgA has been produced in mammalian cells. However, in this case, cost is an important consideration. Regardless of which expression system is used, careful characterization of the in vivo biologic properties of the resulting IgA will be essential.",

It bound antigen (p-azophenylarsonate), Fc\u03b1R on HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, and complement component C3. IgA dimers were assembled inefficiently when the human J-chain was also expressed, with the majority of extracellular IgA being monomers associated with the J-chain ( Carayannopoulos et al., 1994) . It is not clear if the instability of the cova-lent bond between IgA and the J-chain is due to differences in carbohydrate structure or the production level of the J-chain in the baculovirus system. In contrast to what was found for IgA produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Mattu et al., 1998) , insect-cell-produced IgA1 lacking the N-linked carbohydrate in C H 2 did not bind to cells expressing Fc\u03b1R. Human SC has also been produced in Sf9 cells with yields of 50 mg/L.

In addition, sialic acid structure varies among mammalian species, with human cells attaching N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), whereas mouse cells attach N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) (Raju et al., 2000) .

The presence of this carbohydrate structure on therapeutic proteins would have significant consequences. The presence of this epitope on recombinant antibodies is quite variable, with a humanized IgG1 produced by GS-NS0 cells containing no Gal\u03b11\u21923Gal\u03b21 residues (Hills et al., 2001) and H-chain glycans produced in J558 possessing the epitope (Lund et al., 1990 (Lund et al., , 1993 .

            "text": "The general strategy has been to design immunoglobulin expression vectors as cassettes to facilitate manipulation of the antibody genes. The vectors for expression of H-and L-chains usually contain different selectable markers, although bicistronic expression vectors containing human \u03ba L-and J-chain genes and human IgA1 and murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes have also been described (Wolbank et al., 2003) . Because the amount of L-chain produced by a transfectant appears to limit the amount of antibody produced, an effective method for generating transfectants is to first isolate good L-chain-producing transfectants. A second round of transfections with the H-chain and selection using a different marker yields transfectants producing large amounts of antibody (Chintalacharuvu et al., 1994 Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1996; Morton et al., 1993) . Alternatively, cotransfection of L-and H-chains can be performed, but only one marker is usually used for selection (Berdoz et al., 1999) . Variable and constant region genes were initially obtained by genomic cloning but now are more routinely amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cDNA made from antibody-producing cells (Berdoz et al., 1995; Campbell et al., 1992; Coloma et al., 1992; Gavilondo-Cowley et al., 1990; Gillies et al., 1989; Larrick et al., 1989; Orlandi et al., 1989) . PCR has been used successfully for rapid cloning and modification of V regions from antibodies of many different specificities. If the sequence of the variable region to be cloned is known, specific PCR primers can be produced. If the sequence is unknown, degenerate primer sets that anneal to the relatively conserved leader or first framework sequences at the 5\u2032 end are used. A limited number of primers will amplify all of the heavy-chain isotypes; there are only two isotypes of the light chain. By including appropriate restriction sites in the primers, it is straightforward to clone the PCR product into an expression vector. In addition, fully human IgAs have also been produced by cloning V regions from single-chain Fv fragments selected by phage display (Berdoz and Corthesy, 2004; Boel et al., 2000; Huls et al., 1999b) .",

            "text": "The SC is produced by proteolytic cleavage of pIgR during epithelial transcytosis (see Chapter 4). Initially, SIgA was produced by coculturing IgA-producing hybridomas with Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing pIgR (Hirt et al., 1993) . In another approach, polymeric murine IgA produced in mice ascites was injected into Lewis rats, where it associated with the rat pIgR, and SIgA with rat SC was collected from bile ( Renegar et al., 1998) . As an alternative approach, SC was produced by introducing a stop codon into the position corresponding to the natural cleavage site in the pIgR (Rindisbacher et al., 1995) . Purified pIgA from hybridoma cell lines can then combine with the purified recombinant SC in the test tube (Crottet et al., 1999; Lullau et al., 1996; Rindisbacher et al., 1995) . These SIgA complexes had the same affinity for antigen as the native molecule, and formed the correct covalent bonds between the two molecules (Lullau et al., 1996) . Although SIgA is normally a product of two different cell types, recombinant SIgA has been produced in a single cell. When the gene for human SC was transfected into a myeloma cell producing chimeric mouse-human pIgA containing the endogenous murine J-chain, SIgA was produced. Virtually all of the SC was covalently bound to dimeric IgA, and SIgA assembly appeared to take place in the Golgi apparatus ( Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1997) . Subsequently, CHO (Berdoz et al., 1999; Johansen et al., 1999) and Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) (Vidarsson et al., 2001) cells have been used to produce SIgA by transfecting in genes for the human J-chain and SC into cells already expressing chimeric IgA.",

In B-lineage cell lines, the expression of the recombinant H-and L-chain genes is usually driven by the immunoglobulin promoter and enhancer elements (Bruggemann et al., 1987; Chintalacharuvu et al., 1994; Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1996; Knight et al., 1988) . Expression of IgA in B-lineage cell lines is advantageous in that the endogenous J-chain is incorporated into the recombinant IgA. Strong heterologous promoters such as the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter can also be used to direct IgA expression. These viral controlling elements have led to high antibody yields and have the advantage that they are versatile and can function in a variety of cell types such as CHO, BHK, and COS cells as well as lymphoid cells. Chimeric murine-human IgA1 and IgA2 have been produced in these cell lines (Berdoz et al., 1999; Berdoz and Corthesy, 2004; Chintalacharuvu et al., 1994; Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1996; Morton et al., 1993; Trill et al., 1995; Vidarsson et al., 2001) .

A 6xHis tag at the C-terminus of human SC did not alter its secretion by either the baculovirus or vaccinia virus expression systems (Rindisbacher et al., 1995) and a FLAG tag has been used to purify murine SC (Crottet et al., 1999) .",

H-chains and L-chains, which are synthesized on polysomes, are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are assembled into monomers and higher polymers. The H-and L-chains first associate noncovalently and then covalently through disulfide bonds. The predominant covalent assembly pathway for human IgA1, IgA2m(2), and IgA2(n) molecules is through an HL intermediate in which the H-and Lchains are first disulfide bonded before forming the covalently associated H 2 L 2 monomer. In contrast, the major intermediate in the assembly of IgA2m(1) is H 2 , and the majority of the IgA2m(1) molecules lack disulfide bonds between the H-and L-chains (Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1996) . Cys133 in C H 1, which is absent in IgA2, participates in disulfide bond formation with the Lchain in IgA1 (Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1996) . In IgA2, the L-chain is covalently associated to the hinge proximal Cys241 or Cys242 in C H 2, with the structure of the C H 1 influencing the efficiency of disulfide bond formation (Chintalacharuvu et al., 2002) .",

The tailpiece contains an N-linked carbohydrate addition site, which is required for IgA dimer formation (Atkin et al., 1996) , and a conserved penultimate Cys residue, which is involved in polymerization. Studies using domain-exchanged proteins have revealed that in addition to the tailpiece, structural motifs in C H are critical for polymer assembly and J-chain incorporation. Assembly of dimers containing the J-chain requires C \u03b1 3 and the \u03b1 tailpiece, with more efficient dimer assembly in the presence of C \u03b1 2 (Braathen et al., 2002; Chintalacharuvu et al., 2001; Yoo et al., 1999) .",

Both covalent and noncovalent interactions are found between pIgA and pIgR. Human pIgR forms disulfide bonds with human, rat, and rabbit dimeric IgA (Tamer et al., 1995) ; 11 rabbit IgA-f isotypes were shown to bind to rabbit pIgR covalently, whereas 1 rabbit IgA-g isotype was noncovalently associated (Schneiderman et al., 1989) . Disulfide bond formation does not appear to facilitate transport but, rather, might be important in stabilizing pIgA-SC complexes. Although the J-chain promotes IgA polymer assembly, human IgA1 and IgA2m(1) produced in CHO cells were able to form dimers in its absence (Morton et al., 1993) . The J-chain contains eight Cys residues, two of which (Cys15 and 69) form disulfide bonds with the \u03b1-chain and six of which (Cys13, 72, 92, 101, 109, and 134) form intrachain disulfide bridges. The C-terminus of the J-chain as well as two of the three intrachain disulfide bridges were found to be dispensable for formation of IgA polymers but were required for binding to SC (Johansen et al., 2001) . Either Cys15 or Cys69 of the J-chain was required for IgA polymerization, but these polymers were stabilized by noncovalent interactions. Although the noncovalently associated polymers bound free SC, transcytosis by pIgRexpressing MDCK cells was greatly diminished (Johansen et al., 2001) .",

An exposed loop of the C \u03b1 3 domain containing amino acids 402-410 (QEPSQGTTT) was predicted to be the binding site for pIgR (Hexham et al., 1999) , with amino acids 430-443 also participating in pIgR binding (White and Capra, 2002) . However, a naturally occurring mutant that lacks 36 amino acids in C \u03b1 3, including amino acids 402-410, was found to associate with rat SC and be transported from blood into bile in a manner indistinguishable from pIgA (Switzer et al., 1992) . Nevertheless, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins containing monomeric and dimeric forms of amino acids 402-410 and a peptide from a phage display library resembling amino acids 402-410 were transported by the pIgR (Hexham et al., 1999) , suggesting that such peptides might be used to target and deliver therapeutics to mucosal sites. Although the addition of C \u03b1 3 from IgA2m (2) to IgG1 resulted in proteins that incorporated the J-chain and bound to pIgR, the hybrid molecules were transported by pIgR-expressing MDCK cells only with low efficiency (Chintalacharuvu et al., 2001) .",

Replacement of C \u03b3 1 with C \u03b1 1 further increased the stability of the hybrid antibodies, especially at low pH (Chintalacharuvu et al., 2001) . SC serves to increase the stability of IgA (see Chapter 8).

The length of the hinge has been shown to be important for recognition and cleavage by proteases (Senior and Woof, 2005b ) (see Chapter 1).

Initial studies using recombinant human IgA1/IgG1 domain-exchanged proteins revealed that C \u03b1 2 and C \u03b1 3 are necessary and sufficient for binding to Fc\u03b1RI (Carayannopoulos et al., 1996) . Specifically, residues Leu257 and Leu258 in the C H 2 loop and Pro440, Leu441, Ala442, and Phe443 in the C H 3 loop are important for binding and signaling through the receptor (Carayannopoulos et al., 1996; Pleass et al., 1999) . Electrostatic interactions of acidic residues Glu254, Asp255, and Glu437 on IgA1 do not seem to play a major role in binding to Fc\u03b1RI because mutation of these residues had little affect on affinity for the receptor (Pleass et al., 2003a) . The crystal structure of Fc\u03b1RI in complex with the Fc of IgA has confirmed and extended these conclusions (Herr et al., 2003) . The Fc\u03b1RI:Fc\u03b1 interface is composed of a central hydrophobic core composed of Leu257, Leu258, Met433, Leu441, Ala442, Phe443, and the aliphatic portion of the Arg382 side chain flanked by charged residues (Arg382, Glu389, and Glu437). The N-glycans approach within 8 \u00c5 of Fc\u03b1RI but do not directly contact the receptor. Fc\u03b1 is bound to Fc\u03b1RI in an \"upright\" orientation such that its C-terminus would be oriented near the cell membrane when bound to cellassociated Fc\u03b1RI. Bound SC would appear to occlude the binding site, and SIgA does not enhance or stimulate phagocytosis ( Vidarsson et al., 2001) . Indeed, activation of neutrophil effector functions can be prevented by SIgA (Motegi and Kita, 1998) .",

The increased number of these bacteria has led to renewed interest in the use of passive antibodies for the treatment of infectious disease. Passive antibodies were widely used in the preantibiotic era but were abandoned when the widespread use of antibiotics became common (reviewed in Casadevall et al., 2004) . Currently, most of the antibodies in use and in clinical trails are for systemic administration. However, possibly the greatest use for antibodies might lie in their administrations for both the prevention and treatment of infections at the mucosal surfaces, the major portal of entry for infectious agents. From a public health perspective, prevention is very important and direct application of antibody to the site of infection can block pathogen entry. Local administration of antibodies provides effective concentrations of drug immediately, and topical application is an easy and attractive mode of administration. Therapeutics based on IgA would appear to hold great promise for this route of treatment. SIgA can confer protection when administered passively, as in breast milk. In addition, recombinant IgAs have been used in a variety of disease models.",

A mixture of monomeric and dimeric IgA2 containing the J-chain was shown to trigger a respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monomeric IgA but not SIgA was shown to activate phagocytosis of heat-killed Neisseria. Polymeric chimeric IgA2m(1) specific for the enterotoxin A of Clostridium difficile showed increased avidity, which enhanced both the efficacy and duration of protection of human colonic epithelial T84 cell monolayers against the destructive effects of toxin A in comparison to IgG and monomeric IgA containing the same V regions (Stubbe et al., 2000) . The protection in Shigella flexneri infection conferred by IgA specific for serotype 5a LPS was shown to be enhanced when pIgA is associated with SC. SC effectively localized IgA to the epithelial surface of the nasal cavity and the bronchial mucus, whereas IgA by itself was distributed diffusely in tissue. (Phalipon et al., 2002) .",

Therapeutics based on IgA mighty be advantageous over IgG because parasites initiate hypergammaglobulinemia as a smokescreen to evade the immune system (Miller et al., 1994) ; IgG also binds to the inhibitory receptor Fc\u03b3RIIb, thereby interfering with the immune response to the parasite (Clynes et al., 2000) . Pleass et al (2003b) produced a recombinant murine-human chimeric IgA1 and IgG1 against MSP1 19 , merozoite surface protein 1, an antigen on Plasmodium yoelii. IgA1 was more effective than IgG1 in stimulating an oxidative burst in human neutrophils in vitro. However, in a murine model of malaria, IgA1 did not provide protection against lethal parasite infection, as did mouse IgG2b containing the identical V region, presumably because human IgA1 fails to interact with mouse Fc receptor(s). In humans, Fc\u03b1RI is expressed on monocytes and neutrophils, potent effector cells in merozoite killing, as well as on Kupffer and dendritic cells, which are involved in MSP1 19 antigen presentation. Stimulation of Fc\u03b1RI on human monocytes inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 synthesis, which when elevated has shown to correlate with poor prognosis in malaria. In addition, high titers of Plasmodium-specific IgA in serum (Biswas et al., 1995) and breast milk (Leke et al., 1992) have been found in humans living in endemic areas, suggesting that IgA plays a crucial role in immunity against malaria and that recombinant IgA might be an effective therapeutic agent against malaria.",

Recombinant human IgA1 produced in BHK cells specific for Ep-CAM, a tumorassociated antigen, was shown to mediate the killing of tumor cells by unstimulated PMNs. It also mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages, although not as efficiently as human IgG1 containing the same V regions (Huls et al., 1999a) . In addition, chimeric murine-human IgA1 and IgA2 against the HLA class II molecule expressed on B-cell lymphomas were effective in directing the killing of a variety of target cell lines by PMNs. Target cell lysis was inhibited by anti-Fc\u03b1RI, indicating that Fc\u03b1RI is the receptor responsible for antitumor activity (Dechant et al., 2002) . Neutrophils can exert a potent cytolytic capacity against a variety of tumor cells in the presence of antitumor antibody. Immature neutrophils mobilized from the bone marrow by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment have been shown to efficiently trigger tumor cell lysis via Fc\u03b1RI, but not through the Fc\u03b3R (Otten et al., 2005) . Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is expressed on the apical side of carcinoma cells (Buchegger et al., 1989; Burtin et al., 1973) , and it is thought that much of the radiolabeled anti-CEA IgG antibody used for detection (Baum et al., 1994) or therapy of colon carcinomas (Breitz et al., 1992) is unable to reach it due to its particular histological localization. Because chimeric IgA2m(2) against CEA can be transcytosed by the pIgR, it might be a more effective agent (Terskikh et al., 1994) . A novel mouse-human chimeric dimeric IgA specific for the human transferrin receptor (hTfR) has been shown to inhibit proliferation of and induce apoptosis in myeloma cell lines ARH-77 and IM-9 ( Chintalacharuvu et al., unpublished results; Prost et al., 1998; Shinohara et al., 2000) .",

Murine myelomas and CHO cells have been the expression system of choice for the production of antibodies. However, these expression systems do not add carbohydrates identical to those found on human IgA. The use of human cell lines for expression might help to resolve this problem. Transgenic animals are an attractive expression system, especially for the production of SIgA in milk (Houdebine, 2000) . However, the choice of species becomes important because there are species-specific differences in glycan addition. However, these differences might be less of an issue when the recombinant protein will be used for topical administration.",

            "text": "The recombinant antibody industry is in its infancy and shows great promise for rapid and extensive growth. It is expected that IgA will take its place alongside IgG as an important therapeutic molecule. However, for this to take place, certain issues and problems must be addressed. These include the issue of the cost of these complex biologics that require the use of expensive media along with the high costs associated with the purification process. The availability and cost of bovine serum in many growth media are issues that can be addressed by the use of serum-free growth media. Batch-to-batch variation and heteroge-neity in the final product are also important considerations (Stoll et al., 1996) . The design of novel bioreactor configurations for large-scale culture in suspension (McKinney et al., 1995; Sauer et al., 2000) , careful monitoring and control of culture conditions (Monica et al., 1993; Nyberg et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 1996) , and engineering of the production cell lines to improve glycosylation and assembly might solve some of these problems (Davies et al., 2001; Weikert et al., 1999) .",

Although mice do not express an Fc\u03b1RI homologue, the use of human Fc\u03b1RI transgenic mice (van Egmond et al., 1999) might facilitate the study of the role of IgA in immune protection in various disease models. IgA is important in mucosal secretions and SC has an important role in anchoring SIgA to the mucus; however, most clinical trials have been done using oral or nasal administration of pIgA lacking SC (Zeitlin et al., 1999) . With all things considered, we can expect recombinant IgA and SIgA to assume an ever increasing role in the clinic.",
