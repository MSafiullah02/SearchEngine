            "text": "In recent years, the use of specific care bundles to control infection in the intensive care unit has been demonstrated to be effective, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (Heck, 2012; L\u00f3pez-Pueyo et al., 2013). Thus, zero VAP rates have been proposed as an indicator of quality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This has generated debate regarding a lack of a gold standard definition and the recognition of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) not only as an intermediate status preceding VAP, but as an independent source of morbidity by itself worthy of antibiotic treatment (Craven et al., 2016; Nseir et al., 2014; Klompas, 2012). The difficulties with the interpretation of chest X-ray opacities in any critical patient, the sole determinant between the two of them, makes a challenge to differentiate consistently between VAT and VAP. Moreover, this difficulty on the classification of ventilator-associated infections may explain the poor correlation between the sustained decrease of VAP rates, antimicrobial use, and clinical outcomes reported in the last years (Graat et al., 2006; Nora and P\u00f3voa, 2017).",

In these new definitions, the respiratory worsening becomes the key new point, advocating for identifying and monitoring all those processes that can cause respiratory deterioration (infectious or not) in the ventilated patient. This respiratory worsening is specified as the presence of hypoxemia and easily objectified by the changes recorded in two ventilator settings: fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).",

For instance, the removal of antimicrobial agents that would be unlikely indicated in treating lower respiratory infection in a critically ill patient (e.g. oral chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, enteral vancomycin, daptomycin). However, meeting Infection-related Ventilator-Associated Complication (IVAC) definition does not mean that the \u201cinfection related\u201d event is necessarily respiratory in origin. IVAC refers to any infectious event associated with a deterioration in respiratory function. In the context of the critical patient, the new empiric antimicrobial agent may have dual purposes and not aimed, at least exclusively, to a respiratory infection. What is more, central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) or secondary blood stream infections can trigger an IVAC (e.g. by inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome, hydric overload). Otherwise, it could be IVAC due to a ventilator-associated respiratory infection that not meet PVAP criteria and even though VAP or VAT episodes that not meet any VAE criteria as it has been reported (Fan et al., 2016; Ram\u00edrez-Estrada et al., 2018; Pe\u00f1a-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017; Sim et al., 2016). Thus, infectious ventilator-associated complications and non-infectious associated complications could be correlated with IVAC-plus and VAC events, respectively, IVAC-plus encompassing IVAC and PVAP with the purpose of avoiding missing some ventilator-associated infections but not referring exclusively to them. Nevertheless, some VAP and VAT still are being omitted, as it has been pointed out above.",

What it do not make sense that this fact impels some authors against the use of the VAE algorithm by arguing that they are not the same (Pugh et al., 2016; Nair and Niederman, 2017). Actually, the aim of the VAE algorithm is to be a good tool for surveillance and preventability purposes with impact on outcomes (Klompas and Berra, 2016; Klompas et al., 2015). Since there is not a good clinical correlation between them, and above all, VAE not including some VARI, they has to be interpreted as those events occurring during mechanical ventilation, which are worthy of appropriate efforts to preventability purposes because of their clear impact on outcomes.

In these diagrams, the groups are depicted in a series of different size circles, frequently VAC covering IVAC and PVAP. While it is true that the three of them share the first requirement to be defined as VAE, the respiratory worsening, and IVAC shares with PVAP the changes in temperature/white cell count and the antimicrobial prescription, all three tiers only are encompassed by the term VAE. The last update of the new algorithm solved this problem adding a new concept in the algorithm: the IVAC-plus events, that encompasses the other two tiers of the algorithm, IVAC + PVAP. Lately, some authors emphasize the first two tiers as \u201cVAC only/alone\u201d or \u201cIVAC only/alone\u201d when talking about VAEs subtypes to avoid misinterpretations (Klompas et al., 2014; Nakahashi et al., 2018) but other authors can still lead to misunderstanding using the term \u201cIVAC only\u201d meaning IVAC but again using the term IVAC meaning IVAC-plus (Chao et al., 2018).",

The final decision of the new definition threshold to identify VAC in pediatric patients (FiO2 0.25 and MAP of 4 cm H2O) was reached searching for a \u201creasonable\u201d event rate associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Although officially recommended for use in USA pediatric facilities from 2019, it has not been clinically correlated or compared with the 2008-CDC definitions to date. From then on, other pediatric definitions have been proposed. The first VAE variation (Beardsley, 2016) applied a daily minimum PEEP value of at least 2 cm H2O instead of 3 cm H2O used in the adult VAE surveillance definition and they found that this pediatric VAE variation was consistent with PNU1/VAP surveillance definition in terms of incidence. However, only one mechanical ventilation episode met both surveillance definitions. In the same year, there was used another modification of VAC/VAE criteria (VAC/VAEMP) (Cirulis et al., 2016) for also a minimum daily PEEP value greater or equal to 2 cm H2O instead of 3 cm H2O but sustained for at least 1 day instead the 2 calendar days considered in other pediatric and adult VAE definitions (Fig. 2B). This study, conducted in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients also showed low sensitivity to identify all PNU1/VAP using the new proposal. Another VAE variation (Pe\u00f1a-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017) supported the use of an even more less restrictive new pediatric VAE definition (Ped-VAE) by expanding on Cirulis et al. proposal with an additional modification: increase in FiO2 of 0.15 plus an increase in PEEP of \u2265 1 cm H2O sustained for \u2265 1 day, apart from the increase of the daily minimum PEEP value of at least 2 cm H2O or 0.20 FiO2 sustained for \u2265 1 day (Fig. 2C). This is the only pediatric VAE definition prospectively validated in a cohort of children, which was resulted to have greater prediction accuracy for outcomes than 2008-CDC definitions and the adult VAE algorithm without effect on mortality.",

            "text": "All modified pediatric VAE proposals apart from CDC focus on changing the thresholds to meet the first tier of VAE (VAC) and retain the parameters for IVAC and PVAP used in adult definitions. The reasons argued by the authors for this less restrictive algorithm for pediatric VAE definitions were that most children present good pulmonary baseline conditions and can withstand mechanical complications better than children suffering from chronic conditions or adults, and that childhood is needed a shorter recovery time than in adulthood. Indeed, when the VAE adult criteria were applied by Pe\u00f1a-L\u00f3pez et al. to children from a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, incidence of VAE was fewer than in adults and their repercussion on mortality higher (Pe\u00f1a-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017). By contrast, they obtained a fourfold increase in VAEs and the double of PVAP when using their less restrictive criteria for a respiratory worsening in their Ped-VAE proposal, and keeping the repercussion on outcomes. As in the adult population, the agreement between the new 2013-VAE and old 2008-CDC PNU/VAP definitions in children is poor (Mohd Ali et al., 2019) and the same for the new proposed pediatric definitions tested (Pe\u00f1a-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017). Once again, a misinterpretation of these definitions may lead to reject their use but, on the contrary, an in-depth review can generate great interest not only for surveillance but also for their clinical use. Until now, the importance of monitoring ventilator settings as a surrogate for oxygenation had not been previously recognized even though hypoxemia had been suggested to be a main variable in assessing pneumonia resolution. Short courses of antibiotics have been suggested in suspected or confirmed infectious episodes non fulfilling VAE criteria (Klompas et al., 2017). Oxygenation variations have been proposed as the cornerstone in the assessment of the ventilated patient when suspecting and treating a ventilator-associated infection, going one step beyond Chest X-ray opacities and inflammatory parameters (Rello et al., 2018). More research is needed to confirm this new approach.",

The use of these new criteria in children requires an adaptation of the VAE definition in accordance with the peculiarities of the pediatric population. On another hand, neither VAE definition nor VAE tiers are neither sensitive nor specific for VAP or VAT, making difficult to create a clinical correlation; moreover, some VAE subtype terms (VAC and IVAC) are frequently misused in the literature leading to confusion. More research will be needed in the next years to establish the usefulness of the VAE algorithm and its applicability as a quality indicator.",
