Several measures were undertaken by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing, avoidance of travel, closure of nonessential businesses (restaurants, retail stores, sporting events, etc.), and quarantine for infected patients or those with symptoms. In addition, most health-care facilities in the United States have canceled elective surgeries, limited visitors, and transitioned ambulatory clinic visits to televisits to help limit the community spread and to \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d In this crisis situation, optimal management of acute cardiac conditions such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is challenging.",

Recently, cardiologists all over the world have seen a decrease of STEMI patients during this pandemic [3]. In addition, once the patient does present, there may also be delay due to the infection-control measures employed by EMS, ED, and catherization lab personnel to prevent the spread of the infection to themselves and other patients. A recent analysis by Tam et al. [4] at a STEMI center in Hong Kong, China, showed that patients presenting with STEMI have a delay in all three important aspects of care (symptom onset to first medical contact, door to device, and catheterization lab arrival to device). The duration for all of these components of STEMI care was higher than regular on/off hours. Their analysis demonstrated that well-built systems of care for STEMI management can easily be disrupted during this pandemic.",

The notion of \u201ctime is muscle\u201d should still be remembered in these tough times. Recently, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [6] and the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology [7] published guidelines for the management of procedures in cardiac catheterization laboratory. Both sets of guidelines recommend considering thrombolytics at either physician discretion or in low-risk patients. In this review, we discuss the risk vs. benefit of primary PCI and thrombolytics, how the cardiac catheterization laboratory team should be prepared, and what treatment options should be considered in this crisis situation.",

The initial management of STEMI patients is outlined in Fig. 1\n. The bedside diagnosis of COVID-19 is difficult, and if available, molecular point-of-care rapid portable tests of COVID-19 should be performed using Abbott ID Now (Abbott, IL), which can give results in 5 min [8]. However, if rapid testing is not available, primary PCI should be performed as if the patient is COVID-19 positive, irrespective of the test results. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and computed tomography (CT) of the lungs done routinely should be carefully evaluated to rule out pericarditis and other non-cardiac causes of chest pain. Rapid measurement of cardiac troponins can be used to differentiate STEMI from myocarditis, as STEMI has a feature of dynamic change. Also, the CT scan can be evaluated for three major classic features of COVID-19: ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and bilateral pulmonary infiltration with reticular patterns. Point-of-care ultrasound, rather than the standard transthoracic echocardiogram, can be used to evaluate for a new wall-motion abnormality, as there is a risk of exposing the cardiac sonographer to COVID-19. Global left ventricular dysfunction or a wall-motion abnormality not correlating to the EKG is likely caused by myocarditis rather than STEMI. Patients with a new wall-motion abnormality and EKG evidence of a STEMI should be promptly managed as per the proposed algorithm.",

A protocol was recently published from Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital by Zeng et al. [11] describing the use of thrombolysis in STEMI patients if the onset of symptoms was <12 h and proceeding with PCI only after the patient had tested negative for COVID-19. The authors also recommended that the risk of spreading the infection vs. the benefit of performing PCI should be carefully evaluated, and in unstable patients, conservative treatment should be followed until the resolution of pneumonia. However, this approach cannot be readily followed for multiple reasons.1.Many patients have contraindications for thrombolysis [2] (previous stroke or hemorrhagic stroke, active bleeding, elderly, multi-organ failure [liver and kidney damage] due to cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients [12]).2.Inability to identify acute coronary mimics, i.e., no culprit lesions despite STEMI findings on EKG, and increased prevalence of takotsubo, myopericarditis, and possibly even spontaneous coronary artery dissection during acute infections [13,14].3.Increased utilization of resources because of increased length of stay and complications arising from thrombolytics. In an analysis of 29,190 STEMI patients from 229 hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines\u2014Coronary Artery Disease (GWTG-CAD) database, in-hospital mortality (fibrinolytics 4.6% vs. primary PCI 3.3%, p = 0.001), length of stay (fibrinolytics 4 days vs. primary PCI 3 days, p < 0.001), and length of stay >4 days (fibrinolytics 39% vs. primary PCI 28%, p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the group in which thrombolytics were used [15].4.The use of intensive care unit rooms for close monitoring after thrombolytic administration, which can be used for other sick patients.5.A recent study showed that about 31% of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 can go into acute respiratory distress syndrome [12], and there is an increased risk of alveolar hemorrhage with thrombolytics [16].\n",

There should be a low threshold to perform endotracheal intubation for respiratory support in patients with borderline respiratory status or hemodynamic compromise to avoid \u201cemergent\u201d intubation in the catheterization laboratory.\n",

Both COVID-19 patients under investigation and COVID-19-positive patients should be treated similarly, as there could be a delay in test results, which can be harmful in STEMI patients. Only patients with symptom onset of <12 h should be evaluated for either thrombolytics or primary PCI. If a patient presents to a COVID-19-trained and PCI-capable facility, primary PCI should be performed. All the infection precaution steps should be followed by the team, and every effort should be made to achieve ideal door-to-balloon times. If a patient presents to a non-COVID-19-trained lab or a non-PCI-capable hospital and the transfer to a COVID-19-trained/PCI-capable facility can happen within 120 min, it should be initiated. However, if the transfer cannot happen within 120 min, thrombolysis should be performed, and concomitant medical management with aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, or enoxaparin should be followed, as per the guidelines [9,10]. Before thrombolysis is administered, acute coronary syndrome mimics should be ruled out by careful evaluation of the EKG to rule out myopericarditis, and point-of-care ultrasound should be used to evaluate for new wall-motion abnormality. Signs of delayed myocardial enhancement on cardiac CT acquired after the iodinated contrast can be helpful [25,26], and this can be considered in facilities with no cardiac MRI. All unstable patients after thrombolysis should promptly be transferred to COVID-19-trained catheterization labs, and stable patients should be transferred after the resolution of pulmonary symptoms.",

While thrombolysis can potentially be a good choice, many patients have a contraindication, and if thrombolysis is given, it would end up using more resources in these finite hospital settings. Also, with the high probability of the coronary angiogram showing normal coronary arteries during acute infections and pandemics, it is imperative for physicians to use primary PCI as the initial preferred strategy in these stressful situations rather than blindly choosing thrombolytics. Non-invasive diagnostic testing may be useful to differentiate true STEMIs from mimics.
