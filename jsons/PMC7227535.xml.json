About twenty-five percent of patients have a seriously ill disease. A fraction of them may develop a very severe pneumonia which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure that may be associated with a cytokine storm syndrome [2]. Laboratory features associated with ARDS or death included neutrophilia, coagulation dysfunction [e.g., higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer] [3]. Markedly high levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 and the absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8 + T lymphocytes being markedly low seem to characterize the most severe cases [4]. Starting from the first preliminary experience on the apparent efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia [5], many multicenter trials are ongoing to test anti-cytokine treatments in critically ill patients.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate baseline laboratory and immunological features in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and to explore such parameters in relationship to standard of care (SOC group) therapy versus anti-cytokine therapy, mainly tocilizumab, (TOCI group) that was mostly used either in ventilated patients in the ICU or non-invasively ventilated patients, mostly in the ward setting. Our single centre experience and approach showed that the milder hospitalized SOC group faired well as did cases with cytokine storm treated with tocilizumab outside of the ICU setting without ventilator support. Severe complications including bacterial infections complicated tocilizumab in the ICU setting but not ward-based tocilizumab therapy. Therefore, randomized trials should target non-ICU patients to prevent cytokine storm evolution.",

Very recently, IL-6 serum levels were also closely correlated with viral load in critically ill patients and it is important to point out that all our patients belonging to TOCI group received anti-viral agents [17]. Notably, baseline CRP and IL-6 continued to distinguish the two groups (TOCI versus SOC) even after excluding the most seriously ill patients from analyses. Thus, these biomarkers could useful for decision making. Notably, a higher NLR, as well as a higher monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, have been associated with mortality and imaging progression in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 [[18], [19], [20]].

In our study, a significant correlation between CRP and D-dimer, as well as with LDH and neutrophil count (and NLR) was shown. Very recent data showed that low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at prophylactic doses are associated with a reduced short-term mortality in more severe COVID-19 patients [28], and most of our patients, particularly, in ICU, were administered heparin which may have impacted on the overall outcome. Moreover, inflammatory diseases carry a higher risk of thrombosis, as seen in chronic autoimmune diseases [29]. It remains to be seen whether the possible efficacy of anti-cytokine therapy may be even to mitigate against immunothrombosis. Increased levels of LDH and CK may also reflect the level of the organ damage in a systemic disease, as occurs in the macrophage activation syndrome [30], where a hypercoagulable state often complicates the course, and it may be the case for COVID-19. Thus, it is not surprisingly that LDH has been already noticed as biomarker of severity as long as neutrophils, in COVID-19 [3,31].",

No conclusions on the efficacy and safety of treatment approach employed can be provided. Six patients were transferred from other hospitals so original baseline values from the first admission were unavailable. About 50% of the TOCI group were admitted to the ICU within 24 hours from admission, thus they already presented a more serious disease at the time of admission. The follow-up was limited from our hospital admission to discharge. Finally, measurement of viral load was not available. Nevertheless, the cohort is monocentric and it showed similar characteristics to those reported by Wang et al. [2], thus supporting the results, though preliminary.",

Tocilizumab use prior to ventilation in ICU may be optimal since 50% of such cases died, remain ventilated and show serious superinfection. Whether the use of tocilizumab prior to ventilation will be vindicated in randomized trials is of major interest. Our findings also showed that cases receiving tocilizumab on ventilation generally had higher levels of inflammation than non-ventilated TOCI treated subjects, possibly suggesting that the latter group has an intrinsically milder disease with a better prognosis. Timing of anti-cytokine therapy is a key issue.",
