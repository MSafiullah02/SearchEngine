The potential outcome is significant loss of life, economic and social displacement, as well as undermined political institutions and stability. Although international cooperation remains fundamental to effective pandemic preparedness and response efforts, the inevitable arrival of an outbreak within the borders of a country requires that states prepare domestic plans to manage these outbreaks. At the point the outbreak becomes a domestic affair, the burden of control falls to the pandemic preparedness and response infrastructure and institutions established by the country. As has been repeatedly observed across the globe, no country facing an outbreak has proven itself to possess a fully effective response system.",

These and other examples of potential pandemic disasters are made more potent by the easy and rapid international movement of goods, services, people, and vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) characterized by globalization.

Success cannot rely solely on high-technology medical tools, physician care, and vaccination/immunization, but must incorporate widespread implementation of sometimes straightforward yet unpopular (and potentially disruptive) protocols such as social distancing, constraints on population movements, mask distribution, and hand washing. Constructing and implementing an effective domestic pandemic response system thus requires far more than simply investing heavily in traditional public health approaches. As is often noted, even where technically sound solutions exist, they are not always used because of political constraints.7, 8 Indeed, the political nature of pandemic response requires that government officials responsible for pandemic response develop a model that incorporates both advanced public health tools, and local government officials and nonstate actors.",

Second, Taiwan has a public health system that provides high quality care to all its citizens. As a result, traditional public health initiatives can be relatively easily implemented. Third, Taiwan is a medium-sized, contained, wealthy island democracy with an advanced economy.

Incident Management Systems describes a chain of command and control with four components that enhance response coordination across institutional spheres. These components include planning, financing, logistical support, and action. Six Sigma is a process management tool that simplifies complex processes by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps. Both tools influenced Traffic Control Bundling (TCB)\u2014a model developed to arrest nosocomial infection of healthcare workers and patients in hospitals. TCB involves triaging and dispatching patients prior to hospitalization (often outside the hospital itself); maintaining zones of contamination where confirmed cases are housed; distinguishing zones of contamination from clean zones; disinfection stations established between zones with all zones clearly delineated. Studies of hospital infection rates during SARS found that, when implemented, TCB proved highly effective. As a result, TCB has been expanded across Taiwan's hospital system and has been deployed in outbreaks that have occurred since then.30\n",
