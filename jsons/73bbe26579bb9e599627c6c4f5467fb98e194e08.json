The coronavirus family was responsible for two previous pandemic outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). In comparison with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is more contagious and has a lower fatality rate. 5 The morbidity and fatality of COVID-19 are much higher in members of the senior population who manifest multiple comorbidities. 6 Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) usually have several comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. CKD is a global public health problem with a total of approximately 850 million patients with CKD worldwide. 7 In China, the incidence of CKD is 10.8 % and estimates indicate that 119.5 million Chinese adults have CKD. 8 Patients with CKD are highly susceptible to COVID-19. In addition, patients on hemodialysis need to visit the dialysis center regularly three times every week. Therefore, the dialysis center becomes a potential vector responsible for spreading this pandemic.",

To date, we have no evidence to support the relationship between hypertension and COVID-19. Hypertension increases with age. The COVID-19 disease is more severe and displays worse outcomes in the elderly population. 14,15 After adjustment of age, the association between COVID-19 and hypertension was non-existent. 16 Many coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, enter the cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, the risk and severity of COVID-19 might vary with the level of ACE2 receptor. 13 The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are widely used as medications in the treatment of hypertension. As the application of ACEI and ARB leads to an increase in the concentration of ACE2, some doctors question its ability to increase the risk and severity of developing COVID-19 as well. 13 Neither clinical data nor basic scientific evidence supports this assumption. Therefore, patients who take ACEI or ARB are not advised to change their therapy. 13",

If patients with CKD get infected with SARS-CoV-2, their renal tubules are likely to be attacked first. Secondly, patients with CKD are generally the elderly population suffering from multiple comorbidities. They usually have imbalanced ratios of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and decreased activity of natural killer cells. Moreover, some patients with CKD (for whom glomerular disease is the reason for developing CKD), might need to take glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants. This may further lead to impairment of their immune system and create increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Thirdly, there are several small arteries and capillaries in the kidney that may be damaged by the SARS-CoV-2. Further, the entire volume of blood passes through the kidneys several times a day. Hence, the virus and the inflammatory cytokines in the blood flow can damage the kidneys. Lastly, as a severe subgroup of patients with CKD, dialysis patients constitute a more susceptible population. Dialysis patients are recurrently exposed to a possible contaminated environment because their routine treatment usually requires three dialysis sessions per week. 5 Considering all the above reasons, patients with CKD are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. The development of COVID-19 may worsen the impaired kidney function and further lead to rapid deterioration of kidney function and even death.",

Touching of eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands should be avoided. People should stay at home and maintain distance from others. Coughing or sneezing into a tissue or a flexed elbow should be practiced. Objects and surfaces that are frequently touched should be cleaned regularly. 2. Touching of surfaces used in public places should be avoided. A hand towel or tissue should be used when touching doorknobs, light switches, etc. Close contact with sick people and greeting people with a handshake, hug, or a kiss should be avoided. Shoes should be removed outside the house before entering. 3. Medicines should be continued by all patients in prescribed doses and under strict compliance with doctor's instructions unless advised otherwise by their treating doctors. These include the ACE inhibitors and medications for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and urinary protein. All drugs should be continued, especially glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants. Injection therapy, such as cyclophosphamide injection therapy, can be replaced with oral cyclophosphamide or other immunosuppressants under the guidance of a doctor. Subcutaneous injection of erythropoietin can also be replaced by oral drugs. The doctor should be contacted if feeling sick.",

Patients should not be in close proximity, face masks should be worn throughout the dialysis process.
