The treatment regimens described include unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy, medical therapy with mitotane (o,p'-DDD), ketoconazole and metapyrone, and 6oCo irradiation. Currently, the recommended treatment is unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy (Zerbe 1989, Peterson and others 1994) .",

Healthy cats tend to have lower post-ACTH cortisol values than d o dogs (Duesberg and Peterson 1997) . Another explanation would be slow or incomplete resorption of ACTH From the injection site leading to the cortisol peak being missed by the blood sampling. Inadvertent drug administration by the owner would lead to similar results. In cats, bilateral adrenalectomy has been recommended as the treatment of choice for P D H (Zerbe 1989, Peterson and others 1994) . When mitotane treatment was first introduced, information about this treatment regimen was sparse. Mitotane had been used in four healthy cats others 1987, Zerbe 1989) and in one cat with hyperadrenocorticism (Feldman and others 1988) with an inconsistent efficacy in suppressing adrenocortical function. It had been well tolerated, however. Since then, two reports have been published suggesting that mitotane might be effective in treating cats with P D H when given on a long-term basis (Myers and Bruyette 1994a, Feldman 1995) . In the present case, mitotane was given at moderate levels (25 mglkglday) for 10 weeks, then for 11 weeks at 50 rng/kg/week. After a pause of 19 weeks, daily mitotane therapy was resumed for 13 weeks and then decreased to 12.5 mg/kg/week as continuous therapy.",

Whereas cats with bilateral ad renalectom y need to be monitored very closely in the perioperative and early postoperative periods, niitotane treatment requires frequent control examinations for the rest of the animal's life because of sudden changes in cort i coid product ion and insulin requiremenr. This involves much dedication on the part of the owner. However, more investigation is needed in this field before general recommendations for treatment can be made.",
