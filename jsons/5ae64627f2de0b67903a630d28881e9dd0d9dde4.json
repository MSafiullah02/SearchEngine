            "text": "Data on pathologic changes of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease are scarce. To gain knowledge about the pathology that may contribute to disease progression and fatality, we performed postmortem needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients' ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the postmortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients. Changes in the liver and heart are likely secondary or related to the underlying diseases.",

Within 2 months, it had spread all over the world and caused 77,059 confirmed infections, with 2446 fatal cases, in China by 24 February 2020 [1, 2] . The SARS-COV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pathogen shares similarities with SARS-CoV in its genome sequence, biological behavior, and clinical manifestations [2] [3] [4] [5] . It has four major structural proteins: the spike surface glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein [3, 6] . The spike protein binds to host receptors via the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] . The ACE2 protein has been identified in various human organs, including the respiratory system, GI tract, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain [8] . The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [5] . SARS-COV-2 is believed to be more transmissible than SARS-COV [9] .",

Their blood biochemical parameters are similar to those described in the literature [5, 11] . The main pathologic findings from the lungs of these fatal cases of COVID-19 pneumonia include hyaline membrane formation, fibrin exudates, epithelial damage, and diffuse type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, which are all features of DAD. Mild thickening of alveolar walls is also evident in some cases, suggesting a more advanced stage. However, mature fibrosis is not seen. A common feature of the chest radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia is GGO, which may represent an early exudative phase of COVID-19 pneumonia. With advancing disease, consolidation occurs in severely ill patients, likely due to intraalveolar organization by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix formation, and interstitial thickening. In some patients, the radiographic consolidation may be caused by massive intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, likely due to superimposed bacterial pneumonia. These were identified in Case 4, who had a longer clinical course of 52 days. Previously, we identified pathological changes in resected lung specimens of two pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, including edema, proteinaceous exudate, and focal hyperplasia of pneumocytes with only patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and the absence of hyaline membranes [13] . These evidently represent an early Recent studies have shown that the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors on target cells through the RBD on viral particles, leading to replication [7] . ACE2 is localized in various human tissues including the liver [8] . Several clinical studies have shown biochemical evidence of liver injuries [14, 15] . However, only limited histologic hepatic abnormalities are noted in our patients. It has been shown that bile duct epithelium expresses higher density of ACE2 [14] . Since these needle biopsies were limited in sampling, not enough portal tracts were included for thorough examination. The mild lobular lymphocytic infiltration is likely related to the viral infection itself.",

Clinically many patients with COVID-19 showed biochemical parameters consistent with myocardial injury. We suspect that acute tissue injuries related to lowered blood oxygen saturation are too mild to cause visible morphologic changes. However, it may be premature to say whether or not there are viral-induced pathologic changes to the myocardium. Additional cases should be studied.",

Some investigators suggested that this might be due to redistribution of lymphocytes to affected organ tissues. However, this phenomenon is not observed in our study. The mild increase in sinusoidal lymphocytes in the liver is not sufficient to account for the lymphocytopenia. Another possibility may be virus-related suppression of bone marrow, as described in SARS-COV [8, 16] . Unfortunately, no bone marrow tissue has been studied so far.",

            "text": "Pathologically, COVID-19 pneumonia shows overlapping features with SARS. Both exhibit fluid exudation, vascular congestion, inflammatory cellular infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation. With a clinical course of 10 days or shorter, SARS is characterized by acute exudation and hyaline membrane formation. Squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, fibrin plugs, and pulmonary infarct can be seen in some cases beyond 14 days [17, 18] . In SARS cases lasting longer than 20 days, interstitial and alveolar fibroblast proliferation, septal thickening, and organizing pneumonia are seen. Reported pathologic changes for SARS come mostly from full autopsy studies, which should be more representative of the full picture, but they may also be complicated by postmortem changes and other superimposed changes of the terminally ill. In contrast, specimens included in the current study were obtained 1 h after death, largely avoided postmortem degenerative changes. Our previous study of early pathologic changes of COVID-19 pneumonia in two patients showed relatively simple, early exudative phase changes, without hyaline membrane formation, or significant inflammatory cellular infiltration. More advanced pathologic abnormalities are seen in the current study of fatal cases. In China, medical autopsies are not commonly performed. In addition, there are special biosafety concerns associated with patients who have died of COVID-19. Therefore, no autopsies could be performed on patients who died of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak. Autopsies were later permitted to be performed under stringent biosafety regulations, but in Wuhan, there is a shortage of autopsy labs meeting these requirements. Faced with these challenges, we sought for alternatives such as the postmortem biopsies used in this study. This method was also used by another team from Beijing at around the same time [12] . We recognize that due to limited sampling in needle core procedures, studies using postmortem biopsies carry certain limitations. For example, RT-PCT showed direct evidence of the viral sequence in the liver in only one of three cases tested. This may be due to either limited test sensitivity or sampling problem. Because Wuhan is still under lockdown, technical services remain very limited. Rather than working up a protocol optimized for FFPE tissue, a PCR kit designed for pharyngeal swabs was used instead. Second, there is a possibility of RNA degradation, which is common in clinical samples, particularly when specimens are not immediately stored in a transfer medium suitable for preserving RNA. Hopefully, future studies will be able to avoid these challenges and provide a more complete picture of the viral distribution in different tissues.",
