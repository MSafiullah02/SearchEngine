            "text": "Man has known that biological organisms and toxins were useful as weapons of war long before the germ theory of disease was understood. In fact, biological warfare has been used for centuries to sabotage and weaken the enemy (Geissler and van Courtland Moon, 1999). However, as the 20th century came to a close, the perceived difficulties in production, weaponization, and deployment of these biological agents, as well as a belief that moral restraints would preclude the use of these weapons, gave many a false sense of security. Subsequently, a number of events have served to focus attention on the overall threat of terrorism and, in particular, the potential use of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons against the military, civilian populations, or agriculture for the purpose of causing illness, death, or economic loss. The possibility became a reality in October 2001 when someone sent letters containing spores of Bacillus anthracis through the United States mail to media companies in New York City and Boca Raton, Florida and to Senate offices in Washington, DC. This act of bioterrorism resulted in 22 cases of anthrax (11 inhalational and 11 cutaneous) and five deaths, caused considerable panic throughout the United States and other countries, and raised awareness of our vulnerability.",

            "text": "There are more than 1400 species of infectious organisms that are known to be pathogenic for humans; many additional organisms are capable of causing disease in animals and plants (Taylor et al., 2001). Realistically, only a few of these infectious agents pose serious problems or are capable of affecting human, animal, or plant health on a large scale. Even fewer of these agents are viruses. Viruses that could be used as weapons against humans, animals, or plants generally possess such traits as ease of production and dissemination, transmissibility, environmental stability, and high morbidity and mortality rates. Some of these traits (eg, transmissibility, high mortality rates), limited accessibility, and the need for high levels of bio containment may dissuade terrorists from acquiring and producing large amounts of some of these viruses. However, an agroterrorism attack requires relatively little expertise or technology (Wheelis et al., 2002) and terrorists can safely handle most of the causative agents with no risk to becoming infected themselves (Elbers and Knutsson, 2013).",

            "text": "The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Their early use is consistent with what, at the time, was known about infectious diseases, particularly smallpox. In the 16th century, the Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro presented the indigenous peoples of South America with variola-contaminated clothing, which resulted in widespread epidemics of smallpox. During the French and Indian War (1745\u201367), Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander of the British forces in North America, suggested the deliberate use of smallpox to \u201creduce\u201d Native American tribes hostile to the British. One of Amherst\u2019s subordinates, Captain Ecuyer, fearing an attack on Ft. Pitt from Native Americans, acquired two variola-contaminated blankets and a handkerchief from a smallpox hospital and, in a gesture of \u201cgood will\u201d distributed them to the Native Americans. As a result, several outbreaks of smallpox occurred in various tribes in the Ohio River valley (Hopkins, 1983). In 1775, during the Revolutionary War, the British attempted to spread smallpox among the Continental forces by inoculating (variolation) civilians fleeing Boston. In the South, there is evidence that the British were going to distribute slaves who had escaped during hostilities, and were sick with smallpox, back to the rebel plantations in order to spread the disease (Hopkins, 1983).",

Allegations have been made by the government of Cuba that the CIA was responsible for the massive outbreaks of swine fever in 1971 and dengue fever in 1980 that ravaged the country. However, subsequent investigations have failed to find substantive proof of CIA involvement in these outbreaks (Zilinskas, 1999, Leitenberg, 2001). The Aum Shinrikyo, a religious cult responsible for the 1995 sarin gas release in the Tokyo subway system, was also involved in biological warfare activity and sent a team of 16 cult doctors and nurses to Zaire to acquire Ebola virus (Olson, 1999). In 1997, unknown farmers in New Zealand deliberately and illegally introduced rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (a calicivirus) onto the South island as an animal control tool to kill feral rabbits (Carus, 2002). Furthermore, some farmers further propagated the disease by mixing homogenized organs from infected rabbits with carrots and oats and spreading the infected bait in areas heavily infested with rabbits (Carus, 2002).",

            "text": "For more than two decades, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been involved in a number of biocrimes. This most likely reflects the availability of HIV-contaminated blood as a source of this virus as well as widespread news reports concerning HIV and its association with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). For example, in 1990 Graham Farlow, an asymptomatic HIV-infected inmate at a prison in New South Wales, Australia, injected a guard with his HIV-contaminated blood. The guard became infected with HIV; Farlow subsequently died of AIDS (Carus, 2002). In 1992, Brian T. Stewart, a phlebotomist at a St. Louis, MO hospital, injected his 11-month-old son with HIV-contaminated blood during a fight over payment of child support (Carus, 2002). In 1993, Iwan E. injected his former girlfriend with 2.5 mL of HIV-contaminated blood after she broke up with him (Carus, 2002). In 1994, Dr. Richard J. Schmidt, a married Louisiana gastroenterologist, injected his former lover with HIV-contaminated blood (Carus, 2002). Molecular typing of the HIV strains demonstrated that she contracted the same strain of HIV as found in one of Dr. Schmidt\u2019s patients (Metzker et al., 2002). This case was the first time that phylogenetic evidence has been used as evidence in a United States criminal proceeding. In perhaps the most famous case, Dr. David Acer, a Florida dentist infected with HIV, transmitted the disease to six of his patients between 1987 and 1990 (Ou et al., 1992). The mechanism by which HIV was transmitted to these patients was not unambiguously determined and intentional infection remains a possibility (Ciesielski et al., 1994). However, an independent reanalysis of the available sequence data strongly supported dental transmission of HIV (Hillis and Huelsenbeck, 1994). In spite of these incidents and the public fear that HIV engendered, the virus was not included on lists of threat agents for public health bioterrorism preparedness (Rotz et al., 2002). However, others contend that HIV has great weapon potential if the goal is to destabilize a society (Casadevall and Pirofsky, 2004).",

In 1999, an article appeared suggesting that the CIA was investigating whether Iraq was responsible for causing the outbreak of West Nile fever in the New York City area (Preston, 1999). The story relied heavily on a previous story written by an Iraqi defector, claiming that Saddam Hussein planned to use West Nile virus strain SV 1417 to mount an attack. This was the first documented incidence of the West Nile virus in the Western hemisphere and raised concerns of an intentional introduction. However, an investigation revealed that the strain of West Nile virus responsible for this outbreak was the same strain that had been circulating in the Mediterranean region since 1998 (Lanciotti et al., 1999). A fictional \u201cvirus\u201d was also responsible for one of the largest bioterrorism hoaxes in 2000. According to email messages widely circulated on the Internet, an organization known as the Klingerman Foundation was mailing blue envelopes containing sponges sealed in plastic contaminated with a fictional pathogen called the \u201cKlingerman virus.\u201d According to the email alert, 23 people had been infected with the virus, including seven who died. This hoax was resurrected in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on US and the subsequent anthrax attack, evidently because the specifics of the story resemble a germ warfare scenario. In 2011, a South African man was arrested for threatening to spread foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus in the US and Great Britain if he was not paid $4 million. If deployed, FMD virus would have caused the destruction of property and resulted in major economic losses. He was convicted of terrorist activity and money laundering even though he did not have FMD virus in his possession (Keremidis et al., 2013).",

Variola major is considered to be an ideal terrorist weapon because: it is highly transmissible by the aerosol route from infected to susceptible persons; the civilian populations of most countries contain a high proportion of susceptible persons; the disease is associated with a high morbidity and a mortality rate of 30% or more among unvaccinated persons and the absence of specific therapy; and initially, the diagnosis of a disease that has not been seen for more than 30 years would be difficult. In order to counteract the medical consequences of an attack with Variola major, the United States has stockpiled enough vaccine for every American (300 million doses), medical countermeasures to address the needs of individuals for whom the vaccine is contraindicated, and about 2 million doses of a new FDA approved antiviral, ST246 (Tecoviromat), against smallpox (Smith et al., 2009).",

Thus, the significance of FMD for the US is that our cattle, swine, sheep, and goats are totally susceptible to FMD and none have been vaccinated. These herds are the basis of a highly productive agribusiness, which is the largest in the world and a significant component of GDP and our foreign exports. The availability of FMD in endemic countries (eg, Afganistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, and Syria) and the ease with which an animal can become infected make this virus the primary agent of concern for agroterrorism (Wheelis et al., 2002, Breeze, 2004). The economic loss from a FMD outbreak is considerable and is a major reason why this virus is important as an agent for agroterrorism. For example, in the 2001 FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom, which lasted 8 months, cost more than $6.9 billion with more than 6 million animals destroyed and 120,300 farms depopulated in FMD affected areas. It took 18 months to regain normalization of trade following eradication of the disease.",

This pandemic happened before the advent of viral culture and very little was known about the virus until the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Recently, the complete coding sequences of all eight viral RNA segments has been determined by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify fragments of viral RNA retained in preserved tissues from individuals who died during this pandemic (Reid et al., 1999, Taubenberger et al., 1997, Taubenberger et al., 2005). More recently, researchers reconstructed the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus using reverse genetics and observed that this reconstructed virus exhibited exceptional virulence in the model systems examined and that the 1918 hemagglutinin and polymerase genes were essential for optimal virulence (Tumpey et al., 2005). The milestone achievement of reconstructing an \u201cextinct\u201d pandemic virus raised a number of questions including whether it was necessary or wise to recreate by molecular means a naturally extinct virus that caused one of the deadliest pandemics in human history (Taubenberger et al., 2012). Ultimately, senior US government scientists and officials at the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that research on this virus could play an important role in pandemic preparedness efforts as well as shed light on both the reasons for its extraordinary virulence and evolutionary origin.",

            "text": "Influenza pandemics in humans arise from animal influenza viruses, yet the molecular changes that are required for an animal virus to be transmitted efficiently between humans is poorly understood. The viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein is a known host-range determinant as it mediates virus binding to host-specific cellular receptors. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A viruses have circulated in poultry for more than 16 years. However, they only rarely cause human infections and do not transmit efficiently among humans. Two controversial studies were published in 2012 that described mutations leading to the airborne transmission of H5N1 between ferrets, a mammalian model of influenza. In the first study, Fouchier and his colleagues (Herfst et al., 2012) used a combination of genetic engineering and serial infection of ferrets to create a mutant H5N1 virus that could spread among ferrets without direct contact. They used reverse genetics to introduce four amino acid substitutions in the HA protein that have been shown in previous research to make H5N1 viruses more human-like in that the HA would bind preferentially to alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors instead of alpha 2,3-linked receptors. They also introduced a mutation in another viral gene, PB2, the polymerase complex protein, which was linked to the ability to grow in the human respiratory tract, which is cooler than the intestinal tract of birds, where the viruses usually reside. Seeing that this mutant failed to achieve airborne transmission, the researchers serially passed this strain through a series of ferrets in an effort to force it to adapt to the mammalian respiratory tract. In the second study, Kawaoka and his colleagues (Imai et al., 2012) used a somewhat different approach in which they introduced four mutations in the HA gene from a H5N1 virus and then combined it with seven genes from a 2009 H1N1 virus, creating a hybrid virus that was able to spread by air between ferrets. On one hand, these studies provide further indication that a mammalian transmissible H5N1 influenza virus may arise naturally, and paves the way for improved influenza surveillance and pandemic preparedness. On the other hand, some scientists believe that the risks associated with these types of studies (particularly those by Fouchier and colleagues) outweigh the benefits, particularly with respect to the consequences of an accidental release (Roos, 2012).",

In order to address this issue, CDC in collaboration with other partners established an international network of laboratories called the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) (Morse et al., 2003), which was provided with the tools to accomplish this mission. Rapid assays utilizing advanced molecular and immunological technology for detection of agents such as variola virus, as well as emerging public health threats such as SARS coronavirus and H5N1 influenza virus, were distributed to member laboratories. Equipment, training, and proficiency testing are elements of the LRN and contribute to a uniform operational plan. The importance of high-quality standardized testing for detection of these agents is exemplified by the rapid need for medical countermeasures to protect or treat civilian populations. Accurate laboratory analysis is a major element in the decision process for deployment of the Federal Government\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of medical countermeasures (Posid et al., 2011). A similar system was developed by the US Department of Agriculture and its partners to protect US agriculture and the food supply from a bioterrorist attack (Heintzelman, 2011).",

The target for an attack with a viral agent can range from humans to animals and plants. Therefore, agricultural targets are a particular concern because a bioterrorist attack would require relatively little specialized expertise and technology, and can have very large economic consequences (Wheelis et al., 2002, Casagrande, 2002, Breeze, 2004). Nature has provided many challenges to combating viral diseases. Viral agents are much more prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory to take on desired characteristics. With few exceptions, differentiating between natural and intentional viral disease outbreaks can be challenging. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections. For many viruses, laboratory diagnostic methods and reagents must continuously be refined to account for genetic changes and variants. Thus, the challenge of developing bioterrorism countermeasures is significant. Fortunately, this effort contributes to combatting natural disease events more effectively, which has global benefits.",
