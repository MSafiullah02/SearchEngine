            "text": "The prevention and control of virus infections involves a complex interplay between diverse cell types of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of innate lymphoid cell (ILC) that unquestionably play an important role in immune defense against infection in both mice and humans. The contribution of NK cells to cytolytic killing of virus-infected cells is well-established and prominently featured in immunology textbooks. Likewise, the importance of early and potent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) by NK cells is widely accepted. More recently, there is increasing evidence that NK cells play a key regulatory role in shaping adaptive immune responses to control infection [1]. In this capacity, NK cells have been shown to kill both antigen-presenting cells [2, 3] and virus-specific T cells [4, 5\u2022\u2022, 6, 7\u2022, 8\u2022, 9, 10], and can produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-10 (IL-10) to suppress immunity [11, 12, 13]. NK cells can also play a beneficial regulatory role in stimulating adaptive immunity [14]. Finally, a series of recent intriguing studies have questioned the \u2018innate\u2019 nature of NK cells by advancing the concept of long-lived memory NK cells that can contribute to viral control during latent infections or following re-infection [15, 16, 17].",

Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether NK cell activity is beneficial or detrimental during vaccination [18], and whether strategies to cure chronic infection should aim to enhance or subvert NK cells. This uncertainty is almost undoubtedly compounded by the context-dependence of NK cell activity in different virus infections. In order to complement more in-depth summaries of the regulatory [1], antiviral [19], and memory functions [20] of NK cells, this review focuses on highlighting what is presently known about the potential involvement of NK cells in different types of virus infections relevant to human disease.",

This is paralleled by the increased susceptibility of mice lacking NK cells or particular NK-cell receptors to murine CMV (MCMV) infection [22, 23], wherein infected cells are targets of NK-cell cytolytic attack and the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b3 [24]. Notably, several herpesviruses encode genes that promote evasion of NK-cell antiviral function [25].

Infection of susceptible mice triggered the clonal expansion of NK cells expressing the MCMV-specific activating receptor, Ly49H. Following contraction, a small population of these cells persisted long-term in mice and demonstrated enhanced recall function against infection compared to unprimed Ly49H-expressing NK cells. In humans, an analogous population of CD94/NKG2C-expressing NK cells characterized by epigenetic changes in the IFNG locus [26] and other immune loci [27\u2022\u2022, 28\u2022\u2022] becomes prominent after HCMV infection [29, 30].

Removal of NK cells enhanced antiviral T cells responses during MCMV infection [31], which has been attributed to crosstalk between NK cells and antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells [2, 32, 33, 34] as well as production of IL-10 by NK cells [11]. Additionally, there is some speculation that severe T cell-mediated pathology in the absence of cytotoxic function in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients, who suffer severe pathology during uncontrolled virus infections, arises as a consequence of both loss of cytotoxic-mediated elimination of virus infected cells and NK cell-mediated cytotoxic regulation of adaptive immunity [35]. NK cell subversion of antiviral T cells also appeared to be important in preventing development of autoimmune inflammatory conditions associated with persistent herpesvirus infections [36\u2022\u2022]. However, it is unclear to what extent these regulatory functions of NK cells contribute to the antiviral responses against herpesvirus in humans, wherein absence of NK cells is associated with loss of viral control [21\u2022]. A recently developed model of EBV infection of humanized mice, in which NK cells prevented mononucleosis-like disease by targeting infected cells [37], may be useful in trying to parse out the relative contributions of NK cell functions to human disease.",

In each of these viral infections, NK cells have been shown to play a crucial early role in viral control that involves IFN-\u03b3 and the cytolytic protein, perforin [22, 43, 44, 45]. Moreover, both viruses encode proteins that interfere with NK cell function [46, 47, 48]. More recently, memory NK cells that can mediate protection against re-infection were shown to be induced following vaccinia virus administration in mice [17].

However, NK cells can also kill virus-specific CD8T cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner in chronically infected individuals [5\u2022\u2022], thereby suppressing the ability of antiviral T cells to control infection. Moreover, the killing of infected hepatocytes by NK cells also contributes to liver damage and development of disease, whereas NK-cell killing of activated stellate cells in HBV-infected individuals may prevent the development of fibrosis [56, 57]. These reports suggest NK cells play both beneficial and detrimental roles during HBV infection but the overall contribution of these functions to disease severity remains unclear.",

For this reason, the LCMV model was a valuable tool for uncovering the functional contribution of NK cell regulatory function to disease pathogenesis without a confounding contribution of NK cells to direct viral control. NK cells are potently activated by the inflammatory cytokine milieu (e.g. type I IFN) during LCMV infection, resulting in suppression of virus-specific CD4 and CD8T cell responses as well as antigen-presenting cell function [4, 9, 59, 60, 61\u2022\u2022]. Ironically, type I IFN is also critical for protecting antiviral T cells from NK-cell mediated cytolysis [7\u2022, 8\u2022]. Importantly, NK cell inhibition of antiviral T and B cells could prevent fatal immunopathology [4] and facilitate viral persistence during chronic LCMV infection [4, 9, 60, 61\u2022\u2022]. Similar regulatory functions of NK cells during acute LCMV infection contributed to diminished virus-specific memory T-cell and B-cell responses [62\u2022\u2022]. Whether NK cells play a similar role in determining disease outcome during infections of humans with Lassa, Machupo, and other arenaviruses remains to be explored. There is some in vitro evidence that lassa-virus infected APCs stimulate NK cell cytolytic function, which is inhibited by viral nucleoprotein as a viral evasion strategy [63].",

Notably, the yellow fever vaccine 17D (YF-17D) is typically a highly efficacious vaccine, but a recent study found reduced vaccine efficacy in a cohort of vaccine recipients that was associated with an inflamed innate compartment that included highly activated NK cells [64\u2022\u2022]. The high frequency of activated NK cells correlated with poor vaccine responses, including weaker induction of neutralizing antibodies, which suggests a potential role for regulatory NK cells in controlling responses to the YF-17D vaccine or even natural yellow fever virus infection. Alternatively, it remains possible that these activated NK cells with an exhausted-like phenotype may be poor candidates for the induction of memory NK cells, which may be critical in immune defense against this virus. Preliminary studies in mouse models of dengue and West Nile virus infections largely support the concept of direct antiviral functions of NK cells against these pathogens, which is bolstered by reports of viral strategies to evade NK cell mediated attack [65, 66].",

This has been extended to the idea that influenza vaccines stimulate NK cell memory that may be beneficial during subsequent viral infection [70]. By contrast, one report asserted that NK cells suppress influenza-specific T cells and modulate antiviral defense in a regulatory capacity [71].

In the case of infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the sum of available evidence suggests that NK cells are not involved in control of HTLV-1 infection or disease outcome [78]. By contrast, genetic studies have revealed an association between the presence of NK cell receptors (e.g. KIRs) and slower progression toward AIDS disease [79]. This is most likely due to NK cell-mediated killing of infected cells, since the protective KIR alleles are associated with enhanced NK cell cytolysis in vitro [80] and HIV appears to mutate in order to escape NK cell-mediated KIR-facilitated immune pressure [81]. HIV also exerts multiple effects on infected cells in order to subvert NK cell-mediated killing [82, 83, 84, 85]. Nevertheless, the activation of NK cells or the lack of certain inhibitory NK cell receptors has been positively correlated with AIDS progression [86], suggesting that these cells may promote disease while trying to combat the infection. Other studies have highlighted an inverse relationship between NK cells and antiviral T cells [87], which suggests an element of NK-cell regulation of adaptive immunity at play in the determination of pathogenesis of HIV infection. In fact, NK-cell mediated suppression of adaptive immunity has been observed at distinct stages of Friend retrovirus infection of mice, whereas other time points reveal NK cell control of retrovirus replication that was recently shown to be suppressed by regulatory T cells [88, 89]. These studies highlight the potentially complex relationship between NK cells and virus in disease pathogenesis.",

Although NK cells appear capable of antiviral activity against SIV, the distribution, phenotype, and functionality are compromised in chronic SIV infection [91, 92, 93]. A recent and very exciting study not only revealed the presence of functional SIV antigen-specific NK cells present in infected macaques, but highlighted the potential to stimulate virus-specific memory NK cells in macaques through adenoviral vector-mediated vaccination [94\u2022\u2022]. In combination with the realization that HIV-specific memory NK cells could be generated in conventional mice [16] and that distinct memory-like populations of NK cells are present in the blood of HIV-infected but seronegative individuals [95], these studies highlight the incredible potential of developing means to elicit retrovirus-specific memory NK cell responses through immunization that may prevent infection.",

As antitumor effector cells, NK cells and VSV would appear to be on the same team against tumors. However, the direct antiviral functions of NK cells against VSV and other oncolytic viruses can limit the antitumor functionality via rapid clearance the virus itself [97, 98]. Thus, there may be cases in humans where reduced durability of vaccine or therapeutic viral vectors may be a detrimental consequence of NK cell antiviral functions. By contrast, there is a clear beneficial role for NK cells in therapy with oncolytic togaviruses, like Sindbis, which stimulate both direct antitumor functions of the NK cells as well as the positive feedback stimulation of other arms of the immune response via NK cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 [99].",

IL-15 rather than virally encoded factors appears to be the driving force in this NK cell expansion, suggesting there may not be specific NK cell recognition of hantavirus via an NK cell receptor as was the case for MCMV.

            "text": "In conclusion, there are clear instances in humans where NK cells play an important role in combatting virus infection, most notably against DNA viruses. This function can be detrimental when NK cells cause immunopathology or when NK cells are too effective at eliminating viral vectors in oncotherapy and gene therapy trials. There are also defined instances of long-lived memory NK cells that may contribute to immunity and health in ways that are not currently apparent. Importantly, the regulatory function of human NK cells cannot be overlooked in the interpretation of experimental results and evaluation of factors contributing to disease. However, current clinical practices must largely favor strategies to stimulate or induce only the antiviral functions of NK cells. The value of activating NK cells in chronic infection has been realized during therapeutic vaccination of SIV-infected macaques [106\u2022], restoration of HIV-specific T cell responses in human HIV infection [107\u2022], ribavirin/interferon therapy of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in human patients [108], IL-15-based potentiation of anti-HIV immune responses in humanized mice [109], and probiotic enhancement of control of influenza virus infection in mice [110]. Nevertheless, there are also reports that subversion of NK cell function can enhance adaptive immune responses that facilitate better control of virus replication in chronic infection [5\u2022\u2022, 111\u2022]. Moreover, attempts to subvert the regulatory function in order to enhance adaptive immunity may have detrimental consequences for NK cell-mediated host resistance against latent herpesviruses and other viral pathogens present in most healthy adults. Continued evaluation of the specific context-dependent roles of NK cells in human virus infection will be necessary to guide attempts to modulate NK cells in therapy or prevention of infection.",
