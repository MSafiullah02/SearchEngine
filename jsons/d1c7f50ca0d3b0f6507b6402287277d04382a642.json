The potential link with a COVID 19 infection was immediately evoked. The information has been broadcasted across media and \"social\" networks. Very quickly, the message \"chilblains = COVID 19 infection\" circulated. Nevertheless, there is no data to affirm that COVID 19 virus is the cause of these chilblain-like lesions even if many details could be in favour of this hypothesis. It is perhaps only a coincidence. These chilblains can also be an indirect consequence of containment with lifestyle changes (patient remaining barefoot at home \u2026). Many viruses (Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Hepatitis B and C virus, Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV), parvovirus B19...) are able to induce vasculitis either cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis, either systemic vasculitis [1] .",
