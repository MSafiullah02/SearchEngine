The novel 20 coronavirus (COVID-19) is the third coronavirus to be declared as a pandemic in 21 st century 21 after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) also achieved similar status in 2003 and 2012 respectively (Ramadan and 23 Shaib, 2019; Zhong et al., 2003). On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) 24 country office in Wuhan reported symptoms of patients suffering from unexplained low 25 respiratory infections. It was initially declared as 'pneumonia of unknown etiology because of the 26 limited information available about the cause of the disease. On January 12, 2020, WHO 27 announced that infection in Wuhan belongs to coronaviruses, and on February 11, 2020, it was 28 declared as COVID-19 (Cascella et al., 2020). COVID-19 comprises of 65 nm -125nm in 29 diameter and is a single-stranded RNA as nuclei material (Shereen et al., 2020). Moreover, WHO 30 has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic due to its widespread transmission, a significant 31 number of deaths, and higher infections and mortality rate as compared to previous 32 coronaviruses outbreaks. 33 On March 11, Director-General of WHO briefed media outlets regarding COVID-19's spread in 34 114 countries and total confirmed infected and deaths were 118,000 and 4291 to date 35 respectively (Bashir et al., 2020). In the USA, the first infected person has been reported in 36 Washington state, and the lack of coordinated efforts at state and federal levels resulted in 37 widespread outbreak with the USA having the most number of infected people and deaths (Dong 38 et al., 2020).

However, the Californians have paid the high cost of these 76 developments due to continuous deteriorating air quality in the state.

The dataset of environmental pollution indicators such as 116 PM 10, PM 2.5, Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), Volatile organic compounds (VOC), Carbon monoxide 117 (CO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and Lead (Pb) was taken from Environmental Pollution Agency 118 (EPA).

Secondly, the inclusion of datasets about social distancing and personal hygiene would 175 be an interesting research contribution.Conclusion and Policy ImplicationsThe effectiveness of mandatory lockdown measures to combat COVID-19 since Mid-March 2020 was analyzed by studying the concentration of seven environmental pollutants in California state from March 4, 2020, to April 24, 2020. Reduction in economic activities, less road traffic, and statewide mandatory \"stay at home orders\" have contributed to lower environmental 181 pollutant emissions. This study finds that PM2.5, PM 10, Nitrogen dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Sulfur dioxide are significantly correlated with COVID-19 cases in California, and limited human exposure to these pollutants will contribute to defeating COVID-19. Similarly, the significance of PM 2.5 and PM10 suggests that the adoption of green environmental policies should be further promoted as it would shield human life, especially children and the elderly as they are most vulnerable to the outbreak of infectious diseases. As our findings indicate that particulate matter (PM2.5, PM 10) are the major pollutants in California, therefore we suggest that policies about air quality assessment must include transportation of air masses from manufacturing areas. Also, future studies must assess the environmental impact of NO 2 , Ozone, and volatile organic compounds. Lastly, as meteorological conditions are of eminent standing, a",
