At present, it is difficult to estimate the final global impact of the COVID-19. It's an unprecedented huge challenge and disaster for people all over the world.",

The major contributions to the total output came primarily from five countries: the USA (194), England (81), Canada (52), Australia (37) and Danmark (37). And 21 articles contributed by China, ranking 10th. For 17 years of academic production around the world, how small these data are. After SARS, the whole world did not pay enough attention to food safety related to wildlife. Even if the COVID-19 does not break out, those wild animals full of virus will bring other similar hazards to the world. Now the COVID-19 is not over, only doctors, nurses and relevant professionals are fighting against the virus, others are helpless. However, when the epidemic is over, people should not relax but think about how to prevent similar disasters from happening again. Previously, people called for the protection of wild animals on the basis of love and morality, while protecting some rare animals, which is stipulated by law. Now the situation is different. We should carry out a comprehensive and systematic new policy on all kinds of wildlife and food control. Governments and scientists should no longer ignore food safety issues related to wildlife again.",
