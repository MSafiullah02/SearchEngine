GM-CSF activated the MOMC (G-MOMC) to produce greater amounts of interferon while differentiation to DC, by the addition of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and calcium ionophore (GA-MOMC), reduced the levels of interferon production upon challenge with some HSV strains. UV-inactivated virus induced more interferon than infectious virus. L-fucose, an antagonist of the mannose receptor, inhibited the induction of IFN-\u03b1 by UVinactivated virus and gB \u2212 virus (defective in penetration) in MOMC and GA-MOMC but not G-MOMC. L-fucose had little effect on interferon induction by infectious HSV-1. The insensitivity of the G-MOMC to fucose inhibition distinguishes these interferon producing cells from the pDC2 cells previously described as natural interferon producing cells. The mannose receptor appears to be involved in the response to non-infectious forms of HSV but infectious virus appears to use a different pathway. These studies suggest that non-infectious virions and HSV infected cell debris effectively stimulate monocytes and predendritic cells to produce IFN-\u03b1 to initiate host protection against HSV infection.",

Human monocytes produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to Sendai virus or HIV [25, 49] and may also produce interferon in response to HSV. HSV induces high levels of IFN \u03b1 in a minor cell component which have been termed natural interferon producing cells (NIPC). The IFN \u03b1 producing activity of these cells is lost upon overnight in vitro culture of the cell population [58] . A candidate for the NIPC has been identified as the pDC2 (dendritic cell 2 precursor) [53] . These cells lack myeloid or monocytic markers including CD33 (myeloid origin marker), CD13, CD11b, CD15 (markers expressed when precursor cells differentiate into myeloid lineage mononuclear cells), CD11b and CD15 (strongly expressed on granulocytes), CD14 (monocyte marker) antigens, and also lack B-cell and T-cell antigens. Other types of HSV responsive interferon-producing cells may also be present in peripheral blood or the peripheral tissue. For example, in the mouse, the marginal metallophilic macrophages and marginal zone macrophages of the spleen are the major interferon producers in response to IV challenge with HSV and murine DC lines can produce interferon in response to bacteria and viruses, including HSV [16] .",

Large numbers of non-lymphocytic mononuclear cells were obtained by leukophoresis and countercurrent centrifugal elutriation [15] . These cells are predominantly of myeloid origin (MOMC) with a small percentage of immature dendritic cells. Following treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and A23187 (calcium ionophore, ionomycin, 'A') in serum-free cell culture, the monocytes and immature dendritic cells (iDC) undergo a rapid and consistent change to become activated dendritic cells (DC) [17, 36] . The differentiation to DC includes down-regulation of CD14 expression, acquisition of dendritic cell morphological properties, upregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecule expression, and enhanced capacity for T cell sensitization [15] . We demonstrate that the extent of interferon induction is different upon challenge with different strains and forms of HSV and that monocytes, GM-CSF treated monocytes, and the mature dendritic cell populations respond differently to these challenges. The response of the MOMC to some strains of HSV-1 is enhanced by GM-CSF to levels similar to that reported for NIPC. Comparison of the activities of different strains of infectious HSV, UV-inactivated HSV, and a mutant HSV incapable of penetration (K T) [9] and results of treatment with a mannose receptor antagonist indicate that there are more than one mechanism for HSV induction of interferon in the MOMC origin cell populations.",

MOMC are predominantly (>90%) monocytes, contain a minor population of immature dendritic cells (iDC) (1-10%) and have minimal contamination by lymphocytes and neutrophils [15] . MOMC treated with GM-CSF (G-MOMC) appeared similar to the untreated MOMC but maintained their viability to a greater extent over the 4-day-course of the experiment. Both the MOMC and G-MOMC expressed high levels of CD14, the LPS receptor, although G-MOMC expressed lower levels than MOMC with low or absent CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) but a sub-population expressed higher levels of CD86 expression. G-MOMC maintained in serum free medium and treated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (GA-MOMC) readily and reproducibly converted to mature DC [17, 36] . The GA-MOMC cells could be distinguished from the MOMC and G-MOMC by the lack of CD14 expression and upregulation of both CD80 and CD86 expression, characteristics of mature dendritic cells [15] . The loss of CD14 expression and up-regulation of CD80 and CD86 was seen in each experiment. Maintenance of these cells in serum free medium and separation from lymphocytes and granulocytes prevents the effects of bovine serum factors from affecting their development.

The difference in response to infectious and UV-inactivated virus is clearly shown for HSV-1 KOS and UV-inactivated KOS. The strain dependent difference in response was evaluated for HSV-1 strains that differ in their passage history, tissue culture behavior and their ability to cause lethal neuroinvasive disease in the mouse footpad and other models of HSV infection [7, 26, 39] . A MOI of 2 or the equivalent amount of UV-inactivated virus was chosen for the virus challenge because the cytopathological effect of infectious HSV on the different types of MOMC cells was minimal at this dose. Cells from different individuals were used for some of the experiments (different panels of Fig. 2 ). The first set of viruses to be tested included SP7, a low passage neuroinvasive virus and SLP10, an attenuated virus derived from SP7 by passage in Vero cells ( Fig. 2A, 2B) . The response to UV-SP7 was greater than for UV-SLP10 or UV-KOS (data not shown). The response to infectious virus was much less than for The MOI, or MOI-equivalents for all experiments was 2 UV-inactivated virus. The G-MOMC response was greater than for MOMC or GA-MOMC but SP7 was the poorest inducer of interferon in all three cell populations. These trends were observed for different individuals and on different occasions. A different trend in cellular response was observed for the ANG and ANG-path set of viruses. ANG-path was derived from ANG, a clinical virus, by passage in mouse brains to select for a more neuroinvasive virus [39] . Both ANG and ANGpath cause syncytia formation in all three cell populations. ANG-PATH induced interferon, but unlike the previously described viruses, the GA-MOMC produced more interferon upon induction by ANG-PATH than did G-MOMC (Fig. 2C) . ANG was a poor inducer of interferon but induced a small, but measurably greater amount of IFN \u03b1 in GA-MOMC. This strain dependent difference in the trend may indicate a different type of interaction of ANG-path and ANG with the MOMCorigin cells. ",

The K T mutant was developed from KOS by deletion of a 969-base-pair BstEII fragment in the gB-coding region, corresponding to 323 amino acids of the transmembrane region. This virus yields normal virions lacking the glycoprotein B. The K T mutants bind efficiently, but cannot enter cells [9] . Stocks of infectious virus (K T-gB) were prepared by growth in a gB expressing Vero cell line (D6 cells) and stocks of virus lacking gB (K T) were obtained upon infection of the non-complementing Vero cells. An equivalent titer (with respect to KOS) of K T virus was quantitated by two methods.Aliquots of K T virus were allowed to bind to D6 cells and fusion of the cell-bound virus was promoted with PEG treatment [51] . This allowed plaque formation to occur in the complementing D6 cells. In addition, the DNA concentration of aliquots of K T was compared to similar aliquots of KOS, for which the titer was known. These assays indicated that the equivalent-titer of the K T virus stock was approximately 6 \u00d7 10 7 /ml.",

Initial studies demonstrated a concentration dependent inhibition of UV-inactivated HSV-1 KOS induction of interferon in MOMC, G-MOMC and GA-MOMC. Cells pretreated with fucose for 15 min were incubated with UV-KOS (MOI = 10) for 24 h in the presence of fucose and then aliquots were removed and tested for IFN-\u03b1 production. IFN-\u03b1 production in the absence of fucose treatment was set as the 100% control. Fucose treatment caused a biphasic concentration dependent inhibition of IFN \u03b1 production by MOMC and GA-MOMC in response to UV-KOS (Fig. 3) . Although the 50% inhibitory dose was 25 mM, the extent of inhibition (slope) was less at higher concentrations of fucose (50-200 mM) . Interestingly, the effect of fucose treatment of G-MOMC was different from that of MOMC and GA-MOMC. IFN \u03b1 induction in G-MOMC was inhibited by only 20% at 25 mM fucose and this was the maximum level of inhibition (Fig. 3) . These results indicate that there are different mechanisms for IFN \u03b1 induction between these different cell populations with fucose sensitive, fucose less sensitive and fucose insensitive routes of interferon induction. In addition, the primary route of interferon induction for UV-HSV in G-MOMC cells is a fucose insensitive route. Subsequent studies evaluated the ability of fucose (200 mM) to block interferon induction by UV-inactivated ANG, infectious ANG, infectious KOS, and K T. As shown in Fig. 4 , fucose inhibited IFN \u03b1 induction by UV inactivated KOS and UV-inactivated ANG in MOMC and GA-MOMC but not the G-MOMC cell population, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 . Interestingly, fucose did not inhibit IFN-\u03b1 production in response to infectious KOS or ANG virus in any of the three cell types. Unexpectedly, fucose treatment appeared to enhance the IFN-alpha production in the G-MOMC cells. Interferon induction by K T virus was very sensitive to fucose treatment. IFN \u03b1 production was reduced by 90% in MOMC and GA-MOMC, and by 80% in G-MOMC. The difference in 338 Q. Rong et al. ",

The results from our study indicate that various forms and different strains of HSV induce IFN \u03b1 to different extents and likely, by divergent pathways.

This suggests that the suppression of interferon production may be selected during human infection as a means to escape host defenses but this property may be lost upon infection of cells or animals of other species. Other human-specific HSV mechanisms for escaping host protective responses include the HSV-1 UL47 protein block of MHCI expression by blocking the TAP [28] and glycoprotein E binding to the Fc portion of IgG [41] .",

The mechanism of induction for these cells may be different from the pDC2 cells (based on the fucose blocking studies) described by others [38] . The greater response to UV-inactivated virus suggests that non-infectious virions and possibly HSV infected cell debris are the more potent activators of IFN \u03b1 production and that replicating virus can limit the induction of interferon production as a means of escaping host protection. Locally produced GM-CSF would activate monocytes or pDC to enhance production of IFN \u03b1 and protective responses.",

The 100% value represents IFN-\u03b1 production of the cells in the absence of fucose sensitivity to fucose inhibition suggests that infectious virus induces IFN \u03b1 by mechanisms different from UV-inactivated virus, and K T. These results confirm that the mechanism by which HSV induces interferon in G-MOMC is different from MOMC and GA-MOMC.",
