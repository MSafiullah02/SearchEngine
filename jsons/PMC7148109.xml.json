In the early 1960s, Salton was already striving to enhance information retrieval by including clues inferred from bibliographic citations [23]. The development of citation indexes pioneered by Garfield [11] proved determinant for such a research endeavour at the crossroads between the nascent fields of Bibliometrics1 and Information Retrieval (IR) \u2014 BIR. The pioneers who established these fields in Information Science \u2014 such as Salton and Garfield \u2014 were followed by scientists who specialised in one of these [30], leading to the two loosely connected fields we know of today.\n",
