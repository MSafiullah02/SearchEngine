In turn, because these interactions are important mechanisms of biological diversification (Leather, 1990; Basset, 1991a,b; Slansky, 1993), the abundance and distribution of butterflies within a particular area can give insights into the environment's quality (Kocher & Williams, 2000).",

All these variables define the resource\u2010based habitat or habitat requirements of each butterfly species, i.e., the habitat characterised by resources and conditions required by organisms and their access to them (Dennis, 2010). Furthermore, competition among species, presence of invasive species and avoidance strategies to escape from natural enemies (enemy\u2010free space) also affect species occurrence in a given area (Murphy, 2004; Dennis, 2010; Wagner & Van Driesche, 2010; Hanula & Horn, 2011).",

Thus, while habitat requirements can be seen as a property of a species, habitat specialisation is a variable property that can vary with many interacting factors such as the presence of inter\u2010specific competitors, the population density and thus the intra\u2010specific competition and the body size of the individuals, among others (Chase & Leibold, 2003; Dennis et al., 2003, 2011; Rosenfeld, 2003).",

The two species may either use both habitat types equally (generalism) or segregate the use of the two habitat types (specialisation). Species may in fact overlap to different degrees the relative use of each type of habitat (Julliard et al., 2006; Poisot et al., 2011), a pattern that may occur either because of an evolutionary trade\u2010off between the ability of species to exploit a range of resources and their capability of using each one (Futuyma & Moreno, 1988), or because of factors such as inter\u2010specific competition (Schroder & Rosenzweig, 1975).

The aim was to test whether butterfly species with similar habitat requirements overlap their habitat use or, alternatively, they segregate their habitat use despite having similar habitat requirements. To do this, we first defined the requirements, i.e., which habitat types positively or negatively correlate with species abundances, and then used a network\u2010based approach (Bl\u00fcthgen et al., 2006) to analyse the degree of habitat use overlap within groups of species with similar habitat requirements.",

The two northern sites (coded as 2 and 3) (Fig. 1) include areas that have previously been intensively used as military areas, and they can be considered partially anthropised areas. Although some natural parts still persist, the presence of alien and invasive plant species is relevant. These two sites were mainly characterised by open areas with shrubs (Calluna vulgaris, Crataegus monogyna, Rubus caesius, Cytisus scoparius) and by a low density of trees of exotic species, such as Robinia pseudoacacia, Ailanthus altissima and Prunus serotina.",

A double GIS spatial join application associated the field\u2010sampled points with the sectors previously associated with habitat classes (Fig. 1). When more than one habitat class fell into the same sector, we considered it as a separate habitat class composed and identified by the two source\u2013habitat classes.

Morisita is an index of patchiness, and it is used to calculate overlap among samples (Morisita, 1959).

We ran zero\u2010inflated GLMMs due to the huge amount of zeros in our data set. GLMMs were run by applying the AD Model Builder procedure using the \u2018glmmADMB\u2019 package in R (Skaug et al., 2013), specifying the Poisson distribution inside the model (Bolker et al., 2012). Before starting the analysis, we applied a conservative method to calculate significance for each factor included in the model based on the evaluation of the standard deviation calculated for each estimate multiplied by 2. Consequently, estimates were significant only if the interval enclosed by two times their standard deviations did not cross 0. According to Breslow (2004), generalised linear mixed models may yield biased estimates of the variance component when the mean number of counts per treatment combination is less than five, so we removed from the analysis all the species whose number of counted individuals was below this value. Land cover class classification and the year of the sample were inserted in the model as fixed effects and the plot as a random effect.",

Ecotones between open and forest areas were also positively associated with abundance (31111_324, 1412_31111). Similarly, in the second group, we found a positive influence on the abundance of open heath land (324) and a negative influence on the abundance of poplar plantations and dense deciduous forests (31111). Many types of ecotones (31111_324, 2311_3113, 2311_31121) and riparian vegetation (3113) were also positively associated with the abundances of these species. Negative relationships between the abundance and open heath land (324) and its ecotone and natural dense deciduous forests (31111_324) were found in the third group, while the abundances of the species belonging to the fourth group were negatively associated with open anthropised heath areas (1412) and positively associated with the ecotone between open green areas and sparse deciduous forests (2311_31121). In the fifth group, positive influences on the abundance of sparse deciduous forests (31121), open green areas (2311) and poplar plantations (2241) were found. In addition, species of this group were positively associated with some ecotones, particularly those including riparian vegetation (31121_3113, 2311_3113). The year of sampling also affected the abundance of the species of groups 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 3).",

The weakness of this difference was clearly due to the large variance within groups, i.e., species with similar habitat requirements were not all equally specialised (Table 2, Fig. 2). In particular, within all groups but one (group 2), it seemed that one or two species were much more specialised than the others. In group 2, this subdivision was more difficult but the difference between the highest d\ni\u2032 (species 1 and 22) and the lowest d\ni\u2032 (species 6 and 9) was still large.

In particular, species grouping seemed to be based on a continuum index of lightness, ranging from group 1 generally being influenced by open areas to group 5 being strongly related to closed\u2010canopy forests. If we look at the estimates associated with forest habitats and open habitats in our model (Fig. 3), we can see that they changed sign while proceeding from group 1 to group 5. In particular, forests are negatively related to the abundance of the sampled individuals in the first group, but they increase their positive influence while moving to group 5; the opposite occurs for the above\u2010mentioned general open dry areas. Furthermore, all the species, regardless of the group identity, seemed to avoid natural dense deciduous forests and associated ecotones. These are closed and shaded habitats, and luminosity was shown to be very important for butterflies, determining minimum and maximum flight conditions (Douwes, 1976) as well as flight duration (Shreeve, 1984). For example, in a restoration experiment of ponderosa pine forests in North America, butterfly species richness and abundance were up to three times greater in restoration treatment units where host plant and nectar plant species richness were similar to control units, but insolation (light intensity) was significantly greater (Waltz & Covington, 2004).",

            "text": "This differential importance of habitat light intensity in structuring our studied butterfly assemblage is confirmed by a comparison of our results with previous information on the habitat characteristics for the studied species, which revealed a general congruence. All the three species of the first group are reported to inhabit bushy places, and dry and hot areas, and are usually associated with forest ecotones and clearing margins (Table S1). Species of the second group showed a negative relationship with the presence of forest areas, and a positive association with open natural heath areas. Furthermore, species of group 2 seemed to be more influenced by ecotones than species of group 1, with grassland representing the key habitat type. We also found a positive influence of riparian vegetation on individual abundance, probably because most of the individuals belonging to group 2 were sampled in a site characterised by a single line of riparian vegetation and large open areas, thereby representing once again a sort of structural ecotone inside an open area. According to literature, many species of group 2 are defined as ecotone species (Table S1). Groups 3 and 4, on the other hand, which were negatively associated with open heath land and its ecotones, confirmed the decreasing importance of open areas while moving from group 1 to group 5. Indeed, species of group 5 were clearly associated with poplar plantations and sparse deciduous forests. Many species in group 5 were previously reported as being somehow linked to a forest environment (Table S1), but some species are reported to be associated with very different habitats (from open grassland to forests) (Table S1). Additionally, the significant effect of the year in some groups showed a temporal shift in species abundance, suggesting population fluctuations depending on change in abiotic or biotic conditions.",

Two species of group 3 (Everes argiades and Aglais io), which in literature are reported as generalist species in many habitats including flowery bushy places, grassy banks, forest clearings, flowering meadows, forest edges and sheltered rocky gullies (Table S1), were very specialised in our study.

Thus, possible increased competition (i.e. a higher number of species sharing the same habitat requirements) would not increase habitat segregation, while a few highly specialised species would use a subset of habitats exploited by more generalist species. This consideration is consistent with previous network\u2010based studies, which showed nestedness common in both mutualistic (e.g. plant\u2013pollinator) networks (Bascompte et al., 2003) and agonistic (e.g. host\u2013parasite) networks (Joppa et al., 2010) (although compartmentalisation is also observed in agonistic webs, e.g. Prado & Lewinsohn, 2004). Bastolla et al. (2009) showed that the process by which a new species enters a community will likely lead to a nested pattern of interactions, because the new species tries to minimise its competitive load, an action that forces it to interact with the most generalist species. This could also be applied to habitats: When a new species arrives in a given area, it will first select sites with certain characteristics (requirements) and then reduce the overlap with competing species, largely using only a subset of the habitats used by generalist species.",
