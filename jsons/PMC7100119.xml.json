Although regulated cell death or apoptosis seems an important mechanism for RSV clearance, Welliver et al. showed marked expression of the apoptosis marker caspase-3 in airway epithelium of children with fatal RSV-LRTI, suggesting an imbalance in this process (4,5). Interestingly, increasing evidence implicates epithelial apoptosis in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS (6). Several studies demonstrated increased expression of classical apoptotic mediators such as FasL and granzymes (Grs) in the lungs of adults with ALI/ARDS correlating with disease severity (7,8). These findings implicate enhanced activation of apoptotic pathways in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory lung diseases and may be relevant for severe RSV-LRTI in children.",

Grs induce rapid cell death when directed into a target cell, and this mechanism is facilitated by the protein perforin but may also occur independently from perforin (10). Detection of free extracellular GrA and GrB is considered to reflect cytotoxic activation of the cell-mediated immune response (11,12). However, proteolytic active extracellular Grs may also contribute to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and degradation of the extracellular matrix, indicating that Grs may be involved in several mechanisms of the host immune response (13).",

In the present study, we hypothesized that severe RSV-LRTI in children is associated with local activation of the Gr pathway by the cell-mediated host immune response.

Numerous rodent studies have shown that both NK cells and CTLs are recruited to the lungs during primary RSV infection (15\u201317). Graham et al. reported that although CTLs are involved in the clearance of RSV, depletion of these lymphocytes diminishes clinical illness upon exposure to RSV (15). Treatment of RSV-infected CTL depleted mice with high dose RSV-specific CTLs results in viral clearance, but augments lung injury by causing severe hemorrhage and neutrophilic infiltration (21). These findings suggest that cell-mediated cytotoxic responses play an important role in RSV disease pathogenesis in mice, but the relevance in humans is unclear. In vitro studies show that CTLs isolated from peripheral blood of RSV infected infants lyse infected autologous target cells (22,23). However, Welliver et al. recently reported the near absence of CTLs and NK cells in lung tissues from nine infants who died of RSV-LRTI (5). Previous analysis of BALF samples of RSV-infected children showed that a small percentage of the total cells in the lungs is CD8-positive (14). Similarly, in the present study we found low numbers of T-lymphocytes and NK cells in the lungs. However, despite these low cell counts, we report high levels of extracellular Grs and marked GrB expression in these cell populations in the respiratory tract.",

Direct killing of infected cells by Grs is considered a major host defense mechanism against viruses in general. In mice, both GrA and GrB are essential in controlling ectromelia and cytomegalovirus infection (24,25). Interestingly, viruses have been reported to encode proteins that inhibit Grs, suggesting pathogen immune evasive adaptations (26,27). On the other hand, enhanced death of infected cells and/or bystander cells may contribute to the development of disease by causing tissue dysfunction as has been suggested for severe inflammatory lung diseases (6,7,28). Welliver et al. found marked expression of caspase-3 in airway epithelium of children with fatal RSV-LRTI, a finding consistent with studies performed in adult patients with ALI/ARDS (5,29). The study of Welliver et al. suggests an imbalance in apoptosis during severe RSV-LRTI, but the involved cell death pathways remain unclear. Our findings may point toward a role for the Gr pathway in apopotic cell death during severe RSV-LRTI, but contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between the levels of extracellular GrB and caspase-cleaved CK18 in the airways. The release of caspase cleaved CK18 is a surrogate marker of epithelial apoptosis but has not been studied extensively in vivo. The detection of cleaved CK18 in serum was found to correlate well with tissue damage in patients with hantavirus infection, but it is unclear how this protein behaves and reflects epithelial injury in other body fluids, including BALF (30). Histologic analysis of apoptosis to confirm our data are highly preferred but could not be performed in our study for obvious ethical reasons.",

CTLs seemed to contribute to GrB expression the most, but actual degranulation and subsequent Gr release may have differed between the studied cell populations. The highest GrB expression by NK cells occurred on the first day of admission, before the peak of GrB expression by T cells. Similarly, in RSV infected mice the cytotoxic activity of NK cells is highest before CTLs are recruited to the lungs (16).

            "text": "Our finding of GrB expression by CD4+ T-lymphocytes is interesting because it suggests that the Gr pathway may be used to modulate immune responses to RSV. Devadas et al. have shown that TH2 cells express GrB which induces their own cell death (37). Furthermore, they reported that GrB deficient mice have augmented TH2 cytokine responses and lung cellular infiltrations in a model of allergic inflammation. Grossman et al. have shown that the Gr pathway is exploited by natural T-regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+) against autologous activated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (38). These findings suggest that Grs function to control immune responses, in addition to their role in direct virus-infected cell killing. In contrast, another line of research proposes that Grs actively participate in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses. For example, studies in vitro have shown that proteolytic active GrA induces the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts (13). In the present study, Gr levels significantly correlated with IL-8 levels in the airways during severe RSV-LRTI and with total WBC counts after the acute phase of respiratory failure. Moreover, we found evidence that active forms of GrA as well as GrB were present, confirming the potential to exert a biologic function.",

First, all patients had severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure necessitating MV and thus represent the end of the spectrum of RSV disease. This withholds us from drawing firm conclusions when relating the extent of activation of the Gr pathway with markers of disease severity such as PRISM scores and oxygenation index. Second, because all patients (including controls) were subjected to MV and supplemental oxygen it is possible that this might have had (synergistic) effects on Gr levels, inflammation or apoptosis. Third, soluble Grs were measured in TA that may reflect more localized (and thus variable) proximal epithelial lining fluid.",
