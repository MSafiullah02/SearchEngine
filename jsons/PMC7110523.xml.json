In the fourteenth century, the Black Death killed a quarter of the population of Europe. From the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, smallpox swept through the whole of Europe. Moreover, between 1840 and 1862, cholera devastated populations worldwide. Many epidemics have taken place since the beginning of the twentieth century, including Spanish flu, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu, and the Ebola outbreak currently raging in West Africa. The Ebola virus is especially deadly, given its high fatality rate and transmissibility.",

For example, Manchuria had been suffering wars and poverty, and the health infrastructure was inadequate, just like the West Africa of today. A further similarity is that the particularly devastating courses of these two epidemics have been attributed to the biological characteristics of the virus. It is more likely that these are the result of the combination of dysfunctional health systems, international indifference, high population mobility, local customs, densely populated capitals, and a lack of trust in the authorities following years of armed conflict.",

Eventually, the problem of the densely populated, pestilence-ridden area was overcome. The isolation of principle patients, the wearing of masks, segmented martial law, and disinfection by burning the dead (brought about by Dr Wu Lien-teh) were the main methods used in China to combat SARS in 2003, and are still in use.",

Many experts believe that the use of these measures in West Africa would be both wrong and futile. Borders are permeable. People would flee the area by way of bribes because of food shortages or psychological isolation. As the virus has spread unchecked across West Africa, other untraceable emigrants may carry it inside their bodies as they cross borders. Therefore, the WHO recommends that \u201cresponse activities must be adapted in areas of very intense transmission and particular attention must be given to stopping transmission in capital cities, thereby facilitating the larger response and relief effort. If non-essential movement in and out of a containment area is stopped, ensure that essential movement (e.g. for response providers, essential services) continues unhindered. To facilitate Ebola virus disease (EVD) response, defer mass gatherings until intensity of transmission is reduced.\u201d21\n",

On October 26, the first victims of the plague were discovered at Manchuria station. A total distance of 530 miles east of the Dongqing and Zhongdong railroads became the major thoroughfare to Harbin from Manchuria. As a result of social progress, foreign exchange had increased and the opportunity for interactions between countries and regions was also increasing. However, this also increased the possibility of the spread of the epidemic between regions and countries. Therefore, the establishment and implementation of the prevention of infectious diseases was crucial. Medical staff from cosmopolitan centers were selected to conduct quarantine inspections along the main routes of transmission of the epidemic \u2013 railway and steamship routes \u2013 and to set up a temporary hospital at the station, if necessary, cutting off outbound traffic from the infected area. The development and implementation of this quarantine system was in part to avoid the spread of disease among regions, but also to avoid the spread between countries.11, 12, 13\n",

However, the spread of disease may also have been helped by urbanization and development, which have strengthened transport links resulting in the virus being shuttled from villages to the town and back into uninfected areas. Nevertheless, the WHO has not called for a ban on travel, instead recommending that travelers leaving affected countries be screened on departure for fever and anyone suspected of carrying the virus. A comprehensive travel ban would cause economic hardship, but the situation regarding migrant workers from countries with an increasingly uncontrollable epidemic will increase the risk of the international spread of Ebola.25 Thus, in today's situation of economic globalization, although we cannot completely restrict traffic (as in historical times), we are able to support the strict implementation of precautionary measures, providing the necessary medical treatment for the crew and passengers involved in air travel and those handling cargo shipped to and from affected areas, and imposing strict quarantine for disease prevention and control; we are also able to reduce the isolation and economic hardship suffered by affected countries.",

It was midwinter and the ground was frozen solid, but Wu feared that when spring brought warmer weather, the dead bodies would pose a serious public health risk. It was also thought that rats rummaging among the bodies would spread the infection. Mass cremation was the solution, but the Chinese viewed this as an act of desecration.26 To overcome this problem, Wu invited local officials to visit the burial ground and explained to them the health dangers. He then sent a memorandum to the Emperor. After three anxious days, the Imperial Edict allowing cremation arrived. On January 31, 1911, the Chinese Lunar New Year, the first mass cremation in Chinese history began. Bodies that had previously been buried were also dug up and cremated. Eventually, the mortality figures started to decline and the disease ran its course.27 Dr Wu Lien-teh took decisive measures to cremate corpses and ordered all the civil and military officials to watch, along with countless people. This was the first time in Chinese history that collective cremation burial had ever happened.",

These archaic social attitudes and lifestyles have a negative effect on the evasion of such epidemic disasters. The underdeveloped political and economic situation in these countries, in addition to their burial customs, has made it difficult to avoid the limitations in dealing with the Ebola epidemic. This has placed enormous pressure on the governments. In the face of an epidemic and possible death, we must resolutely abandon the shackles of outdated viral prevention systems to avoid the spread of viruses facilitated by the presence of corpses. Although specific practices can be drawn from past experience, we can enforce cremation and inform the public officially of the dangers of the disease through the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), ordering all residents to watch. Seeing the final effects of the disease is likely to have a great emotional impact on the population, and may spur initiatives to abandon folk customs so that the positive role of cremation is recognized in the context of containing Ebola.28\n",

To avoid these situations, we need the media to provide a fair and true platform to allow the public to obtain the most time-sensitive information and be able to communicate on an equal footing, like the newspapers during the fight against the plague. We can also learn from contemporary methods such as The Lancet Twitter chat, a small but positive example that can show us the power and potential of social media to inform and assist. During the chat, new ideas emerged from experts and the audience alike. Only in ways such as these can we find valuable messages such as \u201clocal solutions to local problems need Africans training Africans\u201d.
