This requires careful effort in extracting relevant knowledge from HIN. However, existing models in this setting have the following shortcomings. Mainly, they are not endto-end, which puts the burden on the system to first learn similarity or commuting matrix offline using some manually selected meta-paths before we train for the top-N recommendation objective. Further, they do not attentively extract user-specific information from HIN, which is essential for personalization. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end neural network model -GAMMA (Graph and Multi-view Memory Attention mechanism). We aim to replace the offline meta-path based similarity or commuting matrix computation with a graph attention mechanism. Besides, with different semantics of items in HIN, we propose a multi-view memory attention mechanism to learn more profound user-specific item views. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for top-N recommendation setting.",

The problem of top-N heterogeneous recommendation (short for top-N recommendation with heterogeneous information network) is to come up with a ranked list of highly probable items for each user by utilizing the associated HIN. Recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to several models proposed for HIN based recommendation systems [3, 5, 12, 22] . However, these models have the following shortcomings. First, they are not end-to-end -they rely on the tedious process of manual selection of meta-paths or meta-graphs, followed by offline embedding construction [12] , similarity [3] or commuting matrix computation [22] for the entities in the HIN. Further, the proposed model in [3] uses similarity matrices which are inefficient in both memory and computation. Second, each user may look for different attributes of the items, for example, a user may decide to watch movies based on either the director or cast. We refer to subgraphs of a HIN associated with different attributes of items as different views. Therefore, the relevant information from the HIN should be extracted 'view-wise', according to each user's individual preferences. Third, users may look for more deeper characteristics such as movies starring academy awardwinning actors (we call them components). In such cases, the model should not only be able to focus on the actors of the movie but also focus on whether they are academy award winners. This requires extraction of knowledge from the HIN 'component-wise' and such knowledge can potentially be used to explain why the recommendation system suggests a particular list of movies.",

Additionally, no manual selection of meta-paths is required. We achieve this by using graph attention networks -one for each view of the HIN. Further, we propose a multi-view multi-head memory attention layer, henceforth the M3-layer. The responsibility of this layer is to extract component-wise user-specific information. For example, it could extract information such as actors who are academy-award winners. Furthermore, we propose to use an attention mechanism to aggregate the knowledge coming from different views according to their influence.

As we can see from Table 2 and Table 3 , our model outperforms the HIN based recommendation models as well as the rating-only models on the Amazon and the MovieLens datasets and performs comparably with NeuACF on the Yelp dataset.

From this study, we observe that despite the varying sparsity levels, the performance of our model is consistent across different datasets. Figure 3 (a) shows the objective function value and the validation set performance (in HR@5 and NDCG@5) against the number of training epochs. Further, Fig. 3(b) illustrates the performance comparison of GAMMA when the HIN is ignored vs the HIN is included. The performance improvement shows that our proposed approach effectively utilizes the HIN to improve the top-N recommendations. Figure 3 (c) demonstrates the attention score distribution for different views on the Amazon dataset. This indicates that the influence of different views on the recommendation tasks varies, and attentively selecting information coming from different views is essential. Further, Fig. 3(d) illustrates the performance of GAMMA when the M3-layer is not included vs the M3-layer is included.

In recent years, due to their rich representation capabilities, several neural networks and deep learning models are developed for top-N recommendation settings [21] . For instance, NeuMF [4] combines MF with a multi-layer perceptron to learn better representations for users and items through MF as well as neural networks. Further, autoencoders and variational autoencoders [8] and graph neural network-based models [19] have also been proposed for recommendation systems. Nevertheless, since most of these models entirely rely on past interactions between users and items, their performance is mostly affected when sparsity increases. Recently, to mitigate the sparsity issues, there is an increasing interest in leveraging knowledge from the HIN. Our work falls under this category.",

For instance, HeteRec [20] uses metapath based similarity construction followed by the Bayesian ranking optimization technique for the top-N recommendation. Besides, SemRec [13] employs weighted meta-paths to prioritize and personalize user preferences on different paths. Recently, due to its ability to effectively extract relevant information, employing attention mechanism [9, 18] to recommendation systems is gaining ground [2, 15] . Further, the memory attention network has been employed in the context of top-N social [1] and multi-media [2] recommendation tasks. In terms of utilizing multiple views (aspects) for the items from the HIN, our work is related to NeuACF [3] , MCRec [5] , HERec [12] , KGAT [17] and FMG [22] . For instance, NeuACF [3] follows a two-stage approach -in the first stage, it constructs similarity matrices. In the second stage, these similarity matrices are used for learning deeper representations of the users and items. KGAT [17] incorporates information from the knowledge graph using graph neural networks. Further, Hu et al. [5] proposes a three-way neural interaction model with co-attention for the top-N heterogeneous recommendation. In place of meta-paths, FMG [22] proposes meta-graphs for extracting knowledge from HIN. Further, Shi et al. [12] propose HERec that fuses meta-path based embeddings into extended MF model.",
