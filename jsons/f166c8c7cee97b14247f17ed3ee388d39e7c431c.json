The patient was instructed to breath normally without sniffing. After three minutes, the patient received intravenous 18FDG (4.6 Megabecquerel/kg, Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran), and the neutral olfactory condition continued for another 6 minutes. The patient laid down in a semi darkened, noiseless, and odorless room, with her eyes closed. After an uptake time of 60 min, the brain and whole-body PET/CT scan was performed with sequential TOF-PET/CT (Discovery 690 PET/CT with 64 slices, GE Healthcare, USA). The PET tomography consisted of LYSO (Lu1.8Y0.2 SiO5 (Ce)) crystals with dimensions of 4.2\u00d76.3\u00d725 mm 3 . Data was acquired in 3D mode with scan duration of 10 min for the brain scan and 2 min per bed position for the whole-body scan. The images were reviewed by a nuclear medicine physician and a radiologist with substantial experience in PET/CT reporting in consensus.",

Peripherally located olfactory dendrites within receptor cells that connect to the central nervous system (i.e., olfactory bulb) may provide a route for neuro-invasion in SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia. 6 There are two separate subsystems for smelling and sniffing resulting in stimulation of different cerebral cortices and therefore asymmetric cortical activity. Under olfactory condition (using a pure odor), Cuneus, lingular gyrus, and parahipocampal gyrus have higher glucose metabolic activity mainly in the left hemisphere in right-handed subjects. 8, 9 In contrast, under neutral condition (normal saline used in our study), superior, middle, inferior, medial frontal and orbital gyrus (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex) as well as anterior cingulate gyrus have higher metabolic activity on the leftside compared to the right-side in right-handed subjects.",
