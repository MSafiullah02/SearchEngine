Osteonecrosis often leads to joint destruction, and arthroplasty is eventually required. Enhancement of bone regeneration is a critical management strategy employed in osteonecrosis therapy. Bone tissue engineering based on engineered three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with appropriate architecture and osteoconductive activity, alone or functionalized with bioactive factors, have been developed to enhance bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. In this review, we elaborate on the ideal properties of 3D scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis, including biocompatibility, degradability, porosity, and mechanical performance. In addition, we summarize the development of 3D scaffolds alone or functionalized with bioactive factors for accelerating bone regeneration in osteonecrosis and discuss their prospects for translation to clinical practice.",

            "text": "Insufficient blood supply to bones and bone marrow cells reduces bone cell activity and further leads to bone destruction [18] . Therefore, osteonecrosis inevitably results in the progressive collapse of the joints and subsequent arthritis always, for which arthroplasty is ultimately required [19, 20] . The main underlying reason is that bone regeneration is hampered in the harsh necrotic microenvironment [21] . Alternative therapeutic strategies include non-surgical as well as surgical managements. Some non-surgical management techniques, such as cell therapy [22] [23] [24] , growth factor therapy [17, 25] , cytokine therapy [26] , hormone therapy [27, 28] , and pharmacologic therapy [14, 29, 30] , have shown varying levels of efficacies. However, this management also has apparent disadvantages when administered systemically or via local infusion. Systemic administration results in low concentrations at the necrotic area and causes side effects, local infusion of biological agents is also associated with problems, such as leakage, loss of bioactivity, and initial burst release [31] [32] [33] . Surgical management often requires bone grafting. Autografts and allografts are highly effective in enhancing bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. However, the grafts are associated with the risk of numerous complications, such as limited bone mass, donor site complications, infection, and immune rejection, which limit their clinical applications [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

The 3D structure of the scaffolds mimics the natural microenvironment and provides living space for cells [41, 42] , their porosity promotes recovery of blood supply and bone ingrowth, and their mechanical performance compensates for the insufficient support provided by the subchondral bone.

            "text": "The implantation of 3D scaffolds is an important strategy for enhancing bone tissue regeneration [43] . Natural and synthetic materials have been investigated for the manufacture of 3D scaffolds for enhancing bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. In addition, mixtures of several materials have been used to achieve a balance of the desired physical and chemical properties. Materials whose potential for bone regeneration in osteonecrosis has been studied include organic materials, such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) [32, 39, [44] [45] [46] [47] , poly(D,L-lactic-coglycolide acid)-block-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA\u2212mPEG) [48] , poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) [49] , Cervi Cornus Colla (CCC) [50] , poly(ethylene glycol) maleate citrate (PEGMC) [51] , polylactide (PLA) [52] , poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [53] , peptide-based hydrogel [33] , hyaluronic acid [54] , collagen [55] , demineralized bone matrix (DBM) [25] , and xenogeneic antigen-extracted cancellous bone (XACB) [56] , and inorganic materials, such as calcium phosphate (CP) [57] , \u03b2tricalcium calcium phosphate (TCP) [39, 48, 58] , hydroxyapatite (HA) [46, [59] [60] [61] [62] , ceramic [63, 64] , bioglass [65] , and porous titanium (Ti) [66] . These biomaterials are processed into engineered scaffolds through a variety of technologies and exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, porosity, and mechanical performance. These characteristics are vital for the successful application of 3D scaffolds to enhance bone regeneration in osteonecrosis (Table 1) . adhesion, proliferation, and migration is also necessary to ensure that biomaterials do not cause harmful biological effects [43, 67] . In the osteonecrotic microenvironment, the disruption of blood supply obstructs the excretion of metabolites. Therefore, unlike in normal bone defects, enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis requires that the engineered 3D scaffolds possess stronger biocompatibility in order to avoid complications, such as immunological rejection. Appropriate degradability is also an essential feature for an 3D scaffold. Degradability allows the materials to merge with the newly formed tissue and promotes the release of drugs loaded in the 3D scaffolds [68, 69] . Osteonecrosis commonly occurs in joints, such as the hip joint. The anatomical structure of the joint is complex, and surgery is challenging and prolonged in duration. Therefore, removal of bone grafts causes considerable damage to the patient. After the implanted 3D scaffolds have achieved bone regeneration, their complete degradation without the formation of toxic by-products is the key to solve this problem. In addition, bone regeneration in osteonecrosis is often impeded, owing to impaired osteogenic capability [70, 71] . This requires the 3D scaffolds to maintain structural stability while exhibiting controlled degradation in order to avoid incomplete bone regeneration due to inappropriate degradation.",

In addition, appropriate pore size and interconnection between the pores also play critical roles in promoting bone tissue growth into the 3D scaffolds [75] . Numerous studies indicate that the optimal pore size ranges from 100 to 500 \u03bcm [76] [77] [78] . The pores and interconnected channels in the 3D scaffolds promote nutrient and oxygen transport for penetration of cells and boost angiogenesis [79] [80] [81] .

Osteonecrosis usually involves large joints, which are the weight-bearing parts of the body [86] [87] [88] .

The composite 3D scaffold had excellent elastic properties and mechanical strength, and similar compression strength compared with the acellular cancellous bone of a porcine model.

It comprises an organic matrix and a small quantity of growth factor, which makes it osteoconductive and confers excellent mechanical performance [25, 90] . Peng et al.

After 12 weeks, testing of the compressive strength and bending strength of tissue specimens revealed that the group that received DBM and BMP-2\u2212bFGF-transfected stem cells exhibited the most significant mechanical performance ( Fig. 3A and B).

The combination of core decompression (CD) and bone grafting is commonly used for clinical treatment of osteonecrosis. Owing to their characteristics, e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, porosity, and mechanical performance, engineered 3D scaffolds have clear advantages as bone graft substitute materials, thus allowing the limitations of autografts and allografts, such as source limitations, immune rejection, infection, and difficulty in shaping, to be overcome [34, 35] . However, materials without osteogenic factors, bioactive molecules, or seeded cells have a limited therapeutic effect [93] . For this problem, various bioactive factors were used to functionalize 3D scaffolds to improve the osteoinductivity in osteonecrosis. A variety of functionalized 3D scaffolds were developed, and their efficacies for bone regeneration were demonstrated in various animal models ( 3.1. Combination of three-dimensional scaffolds and cells 3.1.1. Three-dimensional scaffolds and stem cells In the past years, a combination of 3D scaffolds and cells represents an effective management strategy for bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. Mesenchymal stem cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate into several cell lineages (e.g., osteocytes, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells) and possess the homing ability to injury sites [95, 103, 104] . BMSCs are easy to culture and amplify in vitro and accelerate bone healing through differentiation into osteoblasts [105, 106] . Therefore, these cells are of significant interest in the field of bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. Moreover, studies have shown that BMSCs are decreased in number and activity in patients with osteonecrosis [107] .

Many studies have confirmed that BMMCs have stimulatory effects on both vascularization and osteogenesis, with distinct advantages in enhancing bone regeneration in osteonecrosis [112, 113] . A decade ago, Yamasaki et al. [114] used porous HA scaffolds combined with BMMCs for clinical management. The functionalized 3D scaffold effectively promoted bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. Subsequently, Kang et al. [57] constructed 3D scaffolds of strontium (Sr)-doped TCP seeded with BMMCs and analyzed their therapeutic effects.

In particular, compared with cell therapy alone, functionalized 3D scaffolds had a higher percentage of bone ingrowth and reduced numbers of empty lacunae (Fig. 5) , thereby demonstrating decreased necrotic area and promoting healing.

SVFs are useful in accelerating the ingrowth of tissue and ensuring uniformity of the structure of bone tissue. Moreover, SVFs support the regeneration of vascular structure, especially the capillary network [117] . Engineered 3D scaffolds facilitate seeding of SVFs and construct a 3D culture system for SVFs, referred to as osteogenic-vasculogenic constructs [117, 118] . This advanced synthesized bone graft has outstanding intrinsic vascularization and rapid engraftment ability. On this basis, it was shown that SVF-based functionalized 3D scaffolds induced the regeneration of bone necrotic regions [119] . Cell therapy is a promising therapeutic concept. However, it is difficult to achieve the ideal concentration of cells at the location of the lesion, owing to the pathological changes that occur during osteonecrosis. The mediation of 3D scaffolds allows the cells used for treatment to reach the deepest part of necrotic area, thus achieving the full play to the therapeutic effect for a sustained release manner. Further, cell seeding enhances the therapeutic potential of 3D scaffold. Therefore, functionalizing 3D scaffolds by combining with cells is of great therapeutic significance in osteonecrosis.",

BMPs stimulate osteogenic differentiation and enhance the activity of osteoblasts [124, 125] . In addition, BMPs are effective stimulators of new vascularization [126] . However, as a protein substance, loss of activity and structural instability are the main problems that limit the application of BMPs, and a medium, e.g., 3D scaffold, is therefore required. Therefore, the combination of BMPs and 3D scaffolds has obvious potential for accelerating bone regeneration in osteonecrosis.",

Its advantages, when used in combination with 3D scaffolds, are mainly reflected in the effective multi-functional treatment ability. A combination of the advantages of various substances to achieve the optimal therapeutic strategy represents a promising research direction. For example, 3D scaffolds provide local mechanical support, while biomaterial coatings on their surface promote proliferation and adhesion of cells. Finally, PRP is introduced to functionalize the 3D scaffolds. Using this strategy, Zhu et al. [66] created a multi-functionalized 3D Ti/gelatin/PRP scaffold with the capacity to release growth factors stably. The functionalized 3D scaffolds exhibited excellent biosafety and elicited accelerated bone growth. These effects were also demonstrated in an animal model. In another study, TCP/PRP 3D scaffold was designed and manufactured by Zhang et al. [98] The area of new bone had significantly increased in the group of functionalized 3D scaffold. These studies collectively indicate that the 3D scaffold is an effective carrier of PRP for enhanced bone regeneration.",

However, within implants, Mg degrades rapidly in vivo and directly affects mechanical stability. Furthermore, a large number of byproducts produced have an adverse effect on tissue healing [152] . The application of Mg as a component of 3D scaffolds is a common strategy to resolve these limitations. Lai et al. [44] applied the low-temperature rapid prototyping technology to successfully integrate Mg, PLGA, and TCP into a functionalized 3D scaffold. The addition of Mg significantly improved the mechanical performance of the functionalized 3D scaffolds. After 12 weeks of implantation in the rabbit femoral condyle, newly formed bone tissue and new vessel in the functionalized 3D scaffold group were observed. In particular, in the 8 th week, the group of functionalized 3D scaffolds had the most significant proportion of neovasculature and the best vascular structure. These findings established that the Mg-based functionalized 3D scaffolds exhibited great potential for enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis and was expected to be useful in clinical practice.",

In addition, biodegradability also avoids the need for re-surgery to remove materials, reducing physical discomfort and risk as well as economic loss to patients. In addition to biocompatibility and biodegradability, the porosity of the engineered 3D scaffolds facilitates the ingrowth of new bone and neovascularization. In particular, angiogenesis and ingrowth of blood vessels not only promote osseointegration but also enable treatment of the disease at its source and reduce the risk of osteonecrosis repair failure and recurrence, which is critical.",

However, most of the current studies have only explored the mechanical performance of 3D scaffolds in vitro, and the possibility of differences between the mechanical performance in vivo and in vitro should not be ignored. Therefore, subsequent research should aim to accurately elucidate the specific changes in the mechanical performance of 3D scaffolds in vivo. Furthermore, these characteristics have a mutually restrictive relationship. For example, excessive porosity may lead to a decrease in mechanical strength. In contrast, overly rapid degradation may lead to the accumulation of by-products, and overly slow degradation may affect the repair. Therefore, future studies on 3D scaffolds should focus on establishing a balance of these characteristics to achieve the best therapeutic effect.",
