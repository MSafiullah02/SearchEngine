We compared laboratory and clinical findings in children with comparable age distribution and hospitalized due to RSV, HMPV or RV infections. Viral pathogens were detected by a quantitative real time PCR from nasopharyngeal aspirates. No significant differences in the admission diagnosis, laboratory parameters, patient demographics and treatment measures between the three viral causes of respiratory illness were found. No correlation between viral load and disease severity was observed however, there was a significantly lower concentration of the nasopharyngeal interleukin 8 (IL-8) in children with RV compared to HMPV and RSV, indicating a milder proinflammatory reaction. Moreover, RV-infected children had significantly lower body temperature, higher leucocyte counts in peripheral blood, and a tendency to have a shorter stay in hospital than children with either HMPV or RSV infection. Taken together, clinical presentation of the infections with RSV, HMPV, and RV is similar among children of the same age group and not clearly distinguishable by standard clinical or laboratory findings. Therefore, virus specific testing should be included regularly for routine diagnosis of children with respiratory tract infections.",

A previous study found [Franz et al., 2010] that the median age of children with rhinovirus infections was 1.4 years in contrast to children with RSV infections (median 0.5 years). This finding has been confirmed by others [Korppi et al., 2004] .

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected on the day of admission. Out of this collective three groups each encompassing 30 individuals with either HMPV, RSV or RV infection were defined. There were only minor differences in the age distribution as measured by both, the mean age and the range. This was done because in children in the second year of life HMPV, RSV, and RV are frequently found in contrast to very young children who are mostly infected and hospitalized by RSV. These older children are thought to be beyond the period of maternal immunity. Each patient was included only once and no patient was included if more than one viral pathogen was detected.",

Quantitation for HMPV-, RSV-, and Rhinovirus-genomes was performed using known concentrations of plasmids containing the target regions of the viruses. A standard graph of the C T values obtained from serial dilutions of the standard was constructed by the software, the C T values of the unknown samples were plotted on the standard curves and the number of genomes was calculated. Quantitation of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) was performed using a purified anti-cytokine capture antibody (Cat. No. 554716, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), a biotinylated anti-cytokine detection antibody (Cat. No. 554718, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) , and recombinant human IL-8 (Cat. No. 554609, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) as a standard in concentrations from 4.0 pg/ml to 500 pg/ml. Standard curves were calculated using the Magellan TM software (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). The capture antibody was bound to 96-well microtiter plates at a concentration of 2 mg/ml binding solution. Cell-free supernatants of nasopharyngeal aspirates were diluted 1:10 and 1:20 in blocking buffer (PBS-Tween) and tested in duplicate. Samples with IL-8 concentration above the highest standard were retested at higher dilutions.",

Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates showed no statistically significant correlation to the disease severity in any group. The median HMPV viral load was 1.6 \u00c2 10E6 in the mRTI group (range 1.2 \u00c2 10E6-2.5 \u00c2 10E8) and 9.9 \u00c2 10E7 in the sRTI group (range 5.0 \u00c2 10E6-1.7 \u00c2 10E7) (P \u00bc 0.08). The median RSV viral load was 7.2 \u00c2 10E7 in the mRTI group (range 2.6 \u00c2 10E4-1.7 \u00c2 10E8) and 2.0 \u00c2 10E7 in the sRTI group (range 2.3 \u00c2 10E2-5.4 \u00c2 10E8) (P \u00bc 0.84), and the median RV viral load was 1.1 \u00c2 10E6 in the mRTI group (range 5.1 \u00c2 10E3-3.1 \u00c2 10E8) and 8.8 \u00c2 10E5 in the sRTI group (range 5.6 \u00c2 10E3-2.8 \u00c2 10E9) (P \u00bc 0.45). Initiated treatment such as oxygen requirement, frequency of chest X-rays, initiation of antibiotic treatment showed no significant difference between the three groups, although a non significantly higher oxygen require-ment was found in RSV-infected children (Table II) . Patients with rhinovirus infections had a tendency for shorter stay in hospital with a median of 3 days, but the difference was not statistically significant (P \u00bc 0.38). Children with HMPV infections were dismissed from hospital after a median of 5.5 days and those with RSV infections after 4 days (Fig. 1,  top) .

            "text": "In young children the clinical picture of most respiratory infections tends to be more severe, but a straightforward correlation between clinical presentation and the causing respiratory pathogen is absent. Therefore, in the present study hospitalized children with RSV, HMPV, or RV infections and comparable age distribution were compared to minimize the effects of age on the clinical manifestation. It was found that rhinovirus infections could not be differentiated clearly by clinical signs and laboratory parameters on admission from HMPV and RSV infections. The frequency of severe respiratory tract infection was similar between the three groups however some differences could be found regarding the course of illness. Several recent studies compared the clinical signs and the severity mainly between HMPV and RSV with conflicting results. Most studies have found no clear difference [Mullins et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2006] , however some reports describe more severe infections in patients with HMPV or RSV [von Linstow et al., 2004; Wilkesmann et al., 2006 ]. This could be due to different study populations and an age-related frequency of severe manifestations. The third group of the present study, the rhinovirus-infected children showed clinical courses with significantly lower body temperature and a nonsignificant shorter length of stay in hospital. This slightly milder course could be predicted neither by regarding the standard laboratory parameters at admission nor by the more sophisticated determination of the viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. The finding of higher leucocyte counts in RV-infected patients as compared to HMPV-and RSV-infections is in agreement with previous studies [Franz et al., 2010] and might be due to an immune suppressive effect of the latter. Determination of the viral load in respiratory tract infections has been investigated in the past by several groups [Bosis et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2008; Franz et al., 2010; Houben et al., 2010] . In a recent study, a difference in the viral load of most viruses between the date of admission and a second sample several days later and between mono-and mixed infections could be found. In this study, a correlation between viral load and the severity of lower respiratory tract infection was not found in contrast to other reports [Bosis et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2008; Houben et al., 2010] .",

            "text": "The most significant difference in laboratory parameters was seen with nasopharyngeal IL-8 concentrations, which was significantly lower in patients with rhinovirus infections. IL-8 also known as neutrophil chemotactic factor, is a member of the CXC chemokine family and induces chemotaxis in neutrophils and other granulocytes, causing them to migrate towards the site of infection and initiate phagocytosis [Baggiolini and Clark-Lewis, 1992; Baggiolini et al., 1994; Baggiolini et al., 1995] . IL-8 is often associated with localized inflammation and has been described as a proinflammatory mediator [Vlahopoulos et al., 1999] . There are conflicting results in the literature concerning the correlation of cytokine concentrations in the respiratory specimens and the underlying virus. The role of acute phase cytokines (IL1b, IL-6, TNFa) in the nasopharynx during upper respiratory infections with influenza virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus in children were also investigated by others [Patel et al., 2009 ]. They found significantly higher IL-6 concentration during adeno virus and influenza virus infections as compared to rhinoviruses and generally in children with systemic febrile response during upper respiratory infection. In contrast, others compared RSV lower respiratory tract infections with rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection and determined a variety of cytokines and chemokines and could only find a significant difference for IL-15 but not for IL-6 or IL-8 [Garcia et al., 2012] . However, the latter study enrolled less than 20 children in each study group younger than 2 years. The former studies are in agreement with the data presented here showing lower concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in children with rhinovirus infections as compared to HMPV-and RSV-infections and a tendency to lower body temperature. The lower concentrations of the chemotactic factor IL-8 in the nasopharyngeal aspirates contrasts to the higher leucocyte counts in the blood of the rhinovirus infected children underlining that local and systemic immune responses might show different patterns. Increased or prolonged inflammatory responses have been discussed as a reason for a higher disease burden [Turner et al., 1998; Gern et al., 2000; Gern et al., 2002] . Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated if a shorter hospital stay in children with rhinovirus infections indeed correlates with lower concentrations of IL-8 in the nasopharynx.",

            "text": "There were several limitations to the present study. For some patients the documentation of clinical parameters was not complete and a higher number of patients would be necessary to reach higher levels of significance of parameters as length of stay and leucocyte counts. This is supported by a former prospective study [Franz et al., 2010] where significant differences between these two parameters could be found. Finally, a control group of healthy children was not enrolled, unfortunately a common fault in many studies of pediatric patients. Taken together the present data lead to the conclusion that a reliable identification of a HMPV, RSV, or RV infection can only be made by a molecular techniques such as qualitative real time PCR. In contrast quantitation of virus was, in this context, not useful for the assessment of the severity or duration of the disease. Where HMPV-and RSV-infections were quite similar in their clinical course, rhinovirus infections seem to have a tendency to faster recuperation in young children.",
