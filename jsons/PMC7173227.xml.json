            "text": "Lectins are glycoprotein- or glycolipid-associated carbohydrate-binding proteins. These proteins can be found in many kinds of organisms, including prokaryotes, sea corals, algae, fungi, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (Fran\u00e7ois and Balzarini, 2012). Lectins are involved in many biological processes, host-pathogen interactions, cell\u2013cell communication, induction of apoptosis, cancer metastasis and differentiation, targeting of cells, as well as recognizing and binding carbohydrates (Huskens and Schols, 2012). These lectins are characterized by different carbohydrate-binding specificities, including mannose, glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, sialic acid and fucose (Balzarini, 2007). As for mannose-specificity in mammals, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in the serum, characterized as C-type lectin, is well known to function for pathogen recognition in the innate immune system. Binding of this lectin with foreign surface molecule or pathogen can activate the complement cascade as lectin pathway and/or lead directly to phagocytosis of microorganisms via macrophage mannose receptor (Weis et al., 1998, Mason and Tarr, 2015).",

In the ER, the addition of these glycans on the native peptide plays a pivotal role in protein folding. The correctly folded protein then migrates to the Golgi apparatus, where glycosidases and glycosyltransferases process the glycans by trimming and adding new sugars, creating hybrid and complex type glycans (Helenius and Aebi, 2001, Huskens and Schols, 2012). Therefore, mannose is not common in terminal positions of N-linked glycan on surface proteins of mammalian cells but is frequently found on the surfaces of microorganisms (Weis et al., 1998). The mannose can be one of target molecules, which are recognized and excluded as an alien in the mammalian cells.",

N-linked glycan on structural surface protein of a matured enveloped virus contains high-mannose form, its limited oligosaccharide processing is due to the inaccessibility of the relevant enzymes to the site (Mir-Shekari et al., 1997). It was reported that high-mannose form of N-linked glycan was present on glycoproteins of other enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus, (Leonard et al., 1990, Iacob et al., 2008). Glycoproteins in the envelope of many different viruses play an instrumental role in virus entry. Lectins binding to glycan of the viral glycoprotein, therefore, should inhibit viral entry into its host cells, thereby, being considered as attractive targets for antiviral drug research (Balzarini, 2007).",

Expression of mRNAs in cells infected with influenza virus in the presence of lectin PFL, where the virus invasion was prohibited, was compared with that in cells infected with influenza virus in the absence of the lectin, where the virus can invade and propagate in the host cells. Expression levels of 410 genes, which were chosen with keyword \u201cvirus infection\u201d in Entrez data bank (provided by Keyword Gene Analysis in data mining light (Aligent Technology, CA, USA)), were analyzed in the microarray analysis. Among these 410 genes, 19 genes were found to be expressed differently by 4 times between the infected cells and the infection-inhibited cells by the lectin (Table 1\n). It was indicated that the expression levels of 13 genes were decreased and those of 6 genes were increased in the presence of PFL compared with that in the absence of PFL. These decreased 13 genes were mostly responsible for cytokines, chemokines or antiviral-related functions, including IL-2, IL-28B (IFN-\u03bb3), IFN-\u03b2, TNF super family, IFN-induced proteins IFIT1, IFIT2, OAS2, Granzyme A, and MX1 (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014). The result of gene expression patterns indicated that the host cells did not evoke responses against the virus invasion because the lectin completely blocked the virus entry.",

As an antiviral drug with a novel mode of action, carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) that show specificity for high-mannose glycan, especially, cyanobacterium- and alga-derived lectins: CV-N and GRFT have been actively investigated for drugs targeting the initial entry stage of HIV infection. The CV-N and GRFT have been shown to inhibit in vivo transmission of HIV when used as a topical microbicide that can be applied vaginally or rectally, and they have generated interest as a promising new generation of microbicides characterized by specific and potent activity (Tsai et al., 2004, O\u2019Keefe et al., 2009, Kouokam et al., 2011). It is possible that treatment with these bacteria-derived lectins may trigger undesirable side effects or immunogenicity including secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of host T-cells. In fact, the treatment with PFL disturbed various cellular responses such as proliferation or autophagy. The change of expression in many genes was detected to a varying degree (Sato et al., 2016). However, the GRFT treatment induces only minimal changes in secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The GRFT exhibits superior safety profile for use as a tropical microbicide (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2009, Kouokam et al., 2011).",

But the resistant strains of influenza virus can arise rapidly in the presence of the agents (Gubareva et al., 2000, McKimm-Breschkin, 2000). They target on the NA protein of influenza virus. The CBAs binding high-mannose glycan, including PFL, PML, and PTL, as well as CV-N and griffithsin, target on the HA protein. These lectins are apparently promising anti-influenza drugs with different modes of action. The virus itself does not control the structure of the specific oligosaccharides added to those sites of virus proteins (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2003). It was reported that a relatively long time-period of drug exposure was required to afford marked phenotypic resistance against the CBA (Bolmstedt et al., 2001, Balzarini, 2007, Fran\u00e7ois and Balzarini, 2012). Thus, the agents targeted to high-mannose glycan on glycoprotein of enveloped viruses including Pseudomonas-derived lectins: PFL, PML, and PTL, might be active and attractive agents against not only a wide variety of influenza virus strains but also other enveloped viruses.",

These three lectins blocked entry of influenza virus into the host cells, by binding with high-mannose glycan on HA protein of influenza virus. Therefore, these lectins could not exhibit any inhibition after virus had invaded into the infected cells.
