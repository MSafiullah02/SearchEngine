Over the next several days, the clinical status evolves with involvement of the lower respiratory tract manifested by cough and increased work of breathing with use of accessory respiratory muscles to overcome the increased resistance of obstructed airways. In the case described, the lower respiratory tract symptoms were already present at birth, which is not consistent with infection after birth but rather suggest that the infection had occurred before birth. The viral etiology was confirmed in the newborn both by serology and PCR, and corresponded to positive serology for the same virus in the mother. Thus, all historical, clinical, and diagnostic information converge in suggesting vertical transmission of RSV from the mother to the offspring.",

            "text": "As in all case reports, several limitations caution against generalization of our findings. In particular, RSV serology is not standardized and generally not used to make definitive diagnosis of acute infection. Specifically, as IgG cross the placenta, neonatal anti\u2010RSV IgG were likely of maternal origin, and IgM can produce false positives (interference with high titer IgG and other similar viruses). However, several studies have previously demonstrated that the IgA detected in neonatal blood is primarily of fetal origin.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 In normal development, fetal IgA is either undetectable or rises very slowly during gestation and fetal levels at term remain approximately 1000 times lower than concentrations in the maternal circulation.28 Secretory IgA is then transferred to the newborn by breastfeeding,29 but our patient did not receive breast milk in the NICU. Thus, a positive IgG titer indicates that the fetus has \u201cinherited\u201d maternal antibodies, but positive IgA\u2014especially at the high titers found in our patient (1:60)\u2014together with positive IgM at birth suggest strongly that the fetus had been vertically infected. At any rate, these serology results were confirmed in our patient by the detection of clinically relevant amounts of RSV RNA. In addition, to exclude co\u2010infections and/or super\u2010infections, we performed extensive serological tests as well as detection of other RNA viruses (eg, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, virus influenza, virus parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus) that resulted all negative.",

Nevertheless, given the extremely low chance of horizontal transmission, it is reasonable to think that the infection had started prenatally. If so, the studies by Piedimonte et al9 indicated that pups exposed to RSV infection in utero develop strong bronchial hyperreactivity to either electrical nerve stimulation or methacholine challenge after postnatal reinfection with the same virus. Therefore, newborns with early respiratory distress associated with evidence of RSV infection warrant closer follow\u2010up for the possible recurrence of wheezing.",

The most important implication is that the passive prophylaxis with humanized monoclonal antibodies currently offered only to infants at high risk for severe infection should probably be anticipated to expecting mothers in order to prevent prenatal infections. Such protection could be provided in a perhaps more effective, safer, and less expensive way by actively immunizing pregnant women with a suitable vaccine, which could be provided to large segments of the population even in third world countries where RSV is still an important cause of infant mortality.",
