Symptoms of H1N1 influenza A are similar to seasonal influenza and include fever, cough, sore throat and malaise. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been common, both of which are unusual features of seasonal influenza.1 The most common risk factors for H1N1 influenza complications include underlying severe illnesses, chronic lung disease, immunosuppressive conditions, pregnancy and obesity.2",

Influenza is not routinely included in the active search for etiology in every febrile episode in these patients. Among patients with respiratory symptoms during a local influenza epidemic the figures might be as high as 29%.4 In addition, the policy of protective isolation that is the standard of care in most transplant units might be especially efficient in preventing influenza infection.",

The case fatality rate among allogeneic HSCT from 37 centers over three seasons of influenza was 24% (13 of 55).6 It is still too early to appreciate the consequences of infection with H1N1 strain, specifically on HSCT patients, but based on current data, patients at risk are prone to a broad range of severe complications including secondary bacterial pneumonia with or without sepsis, neurologic complications (encephalitis, post-infection encephalopathy, febrile seizures and status epilepticus), cardiac (pericarditis, myocarditis) and toxic shock syndrome. Our patient suffered from respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He then developed an encephalitis-like state and finally died of multi-organ failure, secondary to Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported allogeneic transplant recipient who died of documented H1N1 influenza infection. This case illustrates the importance of preventive isolation measures, including droplet isolation, to avoid exposure to the influenza virus, such as the current H1N1 pandemic. In addition, patients who are candidates for HSCT should definitely be at top priority for receiving H1N1 influenza vaccines.",
