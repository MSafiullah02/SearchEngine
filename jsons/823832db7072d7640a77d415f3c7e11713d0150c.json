Similarly to type I IFNs, IFNls are triggered by infection and induce multiple antiviral responses mediating viral clearance. They also exert pleiotropic effects on the immune system, many of which highly reminiscent to these of type I IFNs. This raised the question whether IFNls and type I IFNs are redundant, and why our organism needs two IFN-based antiviral defense systems to confront infection. Here, we review the latest evidence highlighting the primacy of IFNls in antimicrobial, and in particular antiviral, immunity. We survey their unique and common biology with type I IFNs, their co-operation with type I IFNs in the fine-tuning of antimicrobial immunity and their emerging role in damage control. We also discuss their potential as novel therapeutics that exhibit the beneficial effects, but lack the pro-inflammatory activities causing side effects, of type I IFNs.",

            "text": "Central to IFNl production are pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptor (TLR)3,  TLR5, TLR7/8 and TLR9, RIG-I and MDA-5 which trigger a downstream signaling cascade leading to the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Accordingly, IFNl genes have binding sites for NF-kB, IRF1, IRF3 and IRF7 in their promoter regions similarly to type I IFNs [2, 3, 12] . Although this would suggest co-regulation, this is often not the case; IFNls exhibit a restricted pattern of expression compared to type I IFNs which are almost ubiquitously expressed. IFNls are most abundant at barrier surfaces including the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and can be robustly produced by epithelia and epithelial-origin cells including hepatocytes and some immune cells [10, 11, 13, 14] . This goes beyond the ability of all cells to respond to PRR engagement, suggesting the existence of additional cell-specific epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of IFNl production. For example, RIG-I-like receptor signaling through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) in peroxisomes [15] , sensing through the cytosolic DNA sensor Ku70 [16] , induction of the transcriptional coactivator Med23 [17] or presence of transcriptional repressors such as ZEB1 and BLIMP-1 [18, 19] have all been associated with IFNl production. Whether such mechanisms can broadly account for IFNl expression patterns remains to be established.",

            "text": "All IFNl members engage a unique heterodimeric receptor complex, the IFNLR, that comprises IFNLR1 (IFNLRA, IL-28RA), and IL10R2 (IL-10RB). IFNLR1 confers ligand specificity and enables receptor assembly, while IL10R2 is shared with IL-10 family members and is required for signaling. Binding of IFNl to IFNLR1 and IL10R2 occurs at a 1:1:1 stoichiometry compared to the 2:1:1 ratio between IL-10, IL10R1 and IL10R2 [20 ] . IFNLR stimulation leads to the activation of the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2, and the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 which bind to IRF9, forming the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex [2, 3] . ISGF3 then enters the nucleus and induces the transcription of hundreds of genes, termed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), that generally inhibit viral replication and spread, and exhibit broad antimicrobial functions against viral, bacterial and parasitic infections [21] . Notably, this pathway is also shared with type I IFNs, highlighting the very similar antiviral activity these two systems exhibit [22] [23] [24] . Thus, it has been difficult to segregate IFNl from type I IFN functional or transcriptional responses, with IFNl-induced genes typically representing a subset of all genes elicited by type I IFNs but exhibiting a delayed peak and longer duration [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

            "text": "The most striking difference between the two IFN systems is their receptor distribution. The type I IFN receptor is expressed in almost all cell types. On the contrary, the IFNLR1/IL10RB complex is expressed primarily in cells of epithelial origin and few immune cells, mainly neutrophils and subsets of dendritic cells (DCs), conferring selective IFNl responsiveness to them. This has been demonstrated for both mouse [27 ,28 ,29 ] and human neutrophils [29 ] and plasmacytoid DC (pDCs) [11, 30] , as well as human monocytederived DC [31, 32] , and mouse bone marrow-derived or lung-sorted conventional DC (cDC) of the DC2 phenotype [33] (Figure 1 ). The expression pattern of the receptors largely follows that of their ligands with human and mouse epithelial cells [2,3,13,28 ,34] , pDCs [10, 11, 30, 35, 36] , DC1 [37] and DC2 [11,28 ,36,38] cells, as well as human monocyte-derived DC [31, 32, 38, 39] and macrophages [34, 38, 40] expressing high levels of IFNls upon activation. This points to more specialized roles for IFNls in localized immune responses at epithelial barrier surfaces conferred by epithelial and immune cells. However, subtler differences also exist. For example, JAK2 phosphorylation is induced only by IFNls but not type I IFNs [15] , while other less well-described pathways may also be important for antiviral functions [41 ] , indicating the existence of distinct signalling events that remain to be characterized.",

Treatment of infected cells in culture or experimental animals with recombinant IFNls has been effective against a very diverse range of viruses [42] [43] [44] . However, endogenous nonredundant roles of IFNls that are not compensated by type I IFNs have been difficult to establish. Important progress has recently come from the study of gastrointestinal infections where it was shown that cell responsiveness to IFNls is largely compartmentalized with IFNls acting on intestinal epithelial cells (expressing high levels of IFNLR1) and having minimal effects on lamina propria cells (expressing low levels), while type I IFNs exhibiting the opposite effects [45, 46 ] . Accordingly, it was demonstrated that rotaviruswhich infects epithelial cells -is solely controlled by IFNls while reovirus -which replicates in both epithelial and non-epithelial cells and can spread systemically-requires the co-operative action of IFNls with type I IFNs [45,46 ,47 ] . Similarly, norovirus that grows at the gastrointestinal epithelium but spreads systemically is confronted by both IFN systems [48 ] . Interestingly, IFNls can effectively clear norovirus in antibiotics-treated mice, an effect prohibited by gut commensals [49 ] , adding another level of complexity to the equation.",

Moreover, although nose, bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells express high levels of IFNls following infection [34, 50] , smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and DCs can also do so [10, 11, 51, 52] . This suggested a degree of redundancy between the two IFN systems, supported by early work showing increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections in mice deficient in both IFNLR1 and IFNAR1, but not in mice deficient in only IFNLR1 [23, 53, 54] . However, more recent studies have uncovered major and unique roles of IFNls in antiviral immunity in the lung. They have revealed that IFNls are induced first, at lower viral burden than type I IFNs, and act to limit initial infection spread [28 ] . This is possibly due to the propensity of airway epithelial cells to selectively produce type III IFNs [23, 55] . In line with that, it has been reported that IFNls are essential for preventing virus transmission from the upper airways to the lungs, a process that takes place early during infection [56 ] . Interestingly, IFNls lack the strong pro-inflammatory effects of type I IFNs and are rather anti-inflammatory and tissue protective. As a result, IFNLR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibit increased viral load, inflammation and host damage following infection [28 ], whereas recombinant IFNl2 treatment potently suppresses these outcomes [57] . This is also the case when mice are treated with IFNl2/3 neutralizing antibodies [58] . These data support a model where IFNls confer initial antiviral protection without provoking unnecessary inflammation, while type I IFNs come into play as a second line of defense to enhance antiviral responses at the expense of collateral damage ( Figure 2 ). This model of IFNl action is consistent with the behavior of IFNls in the gastrointestinal tract and may therefore explain their broader role in antiviral defense. Indeed, in the liver, IFNls are also important in providing protective immunity against HBC and HCV infections as demonstrated by the many IFNl gene polymorphisms linked to improved spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance, and the effectiveness of IFNl therapy [59] . Interestingly, this is attributed to the ability of human hepatocytes to preferentially generate and respond to IFNls similarly to respiratory epithelial cells [60] . Moreover, in the skin, IFNls are predominantly expressed over type I IFNs and are associated with reduced incidence to infections [61] .",

This is functionally important. in vitro, IFNls enhanced epithelial barrier integrity, preventing bacterial dissemination [9 ] . In vivo, in models of S. aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, IFNLR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited lower Lambda interferons in antiviral immunity and damage control Andreakos, Zanoni and Galani 69 bacterial loads and less pathology, although inflammatory cell infiltration was not affected [62] . Also, intranasal infection of IFNLR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with S. aureus led to significantly increased bacterial clearance and, at the same time, decreased proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1b in the airways [63] . Interestingly, in this study IL-1b production appeared to be regulated by proteases released by neutrophils rather than NLRP3 and capsase-1 activation. Moreover, in a model of invasive aspergillosis with Aspergillus fumigatus, IFNLR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice developed aggravated disease, with higher fungal loads in the lungs and more severe fungal invasion [64 ] . This was largely due to IFNl-mediated STAT1 activation in neutrophils, that was shown to protect the host. Further studies are therefore needed to shed light into the wider role of IFNls in antimicrobial defenses beyond viral infections.",

Contrary to type I IFNs, IFNls suppress innate pro-inflammatory responses and limit the host damaging effects associated with inflammation. This is largely due to their selective action on neutrophils, preventing their pro-inflammatory activation and functions. Thus, in the context of influenza viral infection, IFNls restrain the production of TNF, IL-1b and other tissue destructive mediators from neutrophils, while allowing effective antiviral responses to develop [28 ] . Although it is unclear whether this is a direct effect, it nevertheless shows that IFNls are critically involved in keeping inflammation under control and limiting collateral damage. In the context of chronic intestinal inflammation, IFNls act directly on neutrophils to inhibit the generation of ROS and their degranulation through a process mediated by JAK2 [29 ] . IFNls can also induce additional beneficial effects by accelerating mucosal healing [65 ] . Exogenous administration of recombinant IFNls in experimental animal models with influenza virus infection or colitis has further confirmed their regulatory and anti-inflammatory activity, and has highlighted their therapeutic potential [29 ,57] . Moreover, exogenous administration of recombinant IFNls has shown therapeutic potential in other diseases where IFNls may not be produced naturally such as collagen-induced Model of IFNl action. IFNls confer initial antiviral protection at anatomical barriers without provoking unnecessary inflammation. Type I IFNs come up as a second line of defense, following escape from IFNl control, to enhance antiviral and immunoinflammatory responses, at the expense though of collateral damage. [66 ] . In arthritis, the efficacy of IFNl treatment was attributed to the inhibitory effects of IFNls in neutrophil migration [27 ] . In arterial thrombosis, IFNl-mediated protection was due to the suppressive effects of IFNls on neutrophil-extracellular traps (NETs) formation [66 ] . This anti-inflammatory or immune-modulatory behavior of IFNls is reminiscent of the activity of IL-10 with which IFNls share sequence homology and the IL10RB subunit for signaling ( Figure 3 ).",

IFNls signal on DC2 cells [31] [32] [33] and pDCs [11, 30] , of both human and mouse origin, and modulate their function. in vitro, IFNls enhance the propensity of human monocyte-derived DCs to generate Foxp3 + regulatory T cells [31, 32] . in vivo, IFNls suppress the ability of mouse DC2 cells to induce T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 differentiation, and enhance Th1 cell development [33] . This is consistent with cell culture studies using mouse DC2 and T cells [33] , or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [67] . Interestingly, a SNP in the Ifnl3 locus (rs8099917) is linked to higher IFNl3 production and Th1 skewing following PBMC stimulation with influenza virus [68] . A shift in IFNg production from NK cells is also observed but this might be indirect as neither NK cells [11, 13] nor T cells [11, 33] seem to respond to IFNls. The Th1 skewing effect of IFNls may be related to their capacity to increase the expression of the Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12 in a context-dependent manner [33, 69] . Noteworthy, cytotoxic T cell responses may also be affected by IFNls as increased CD8 + T cell responses have been reported in IFNLR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice following acute LCMV infection [70] .",
