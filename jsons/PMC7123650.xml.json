His view is that these five factors undergo the process of \u201cpassing through the tunnel\u201d in consecutive order, thereby directly and indirectly affecting policy output. He considered historic-geographic conditions and socioeconomic composition as different elements because two states having similar environment and natural resources often have a different socioeconomic composition, and put historic-geographic conditions before socioeconomic composition because the former tends to change less than the latter. The third element of mass political behavior affects the decision of government institutions and the behavior of elites independent of socioeconomic composition. The last step to formal policy change is elite behavior, which is a part of a residual category to explain undiscovered reasons of policy change (Hofferbert 1974).",

The first change is gradual, and it is a decision-making method commonly encountered in a general policy process. The second change indicates development of a new policy tool. The third change refers to rapid changes that bring a paradigm shift. The first and second changes do not necessarily lead to the third change (Hall 1993). Kingdon\u2019s PSF, also referred to as a \u201cmulti-stream framework\u201d or \u201cwindow of policy model,\u201d was originally developed as a policy agenda setting model, but now has extended to the model for explaining policy change, policy formation, policy implementation, and policy evaluation (Oh 2015). PSF\u2019s three streams, the problem stream, the politics stream and the policy alternative stream, independently flow according to their roles and are suddenly combined when a dramatic event or a political event occurs, resulting in policy change driven by the triggering device (Jeong et al. 2017). The scheme of PSF is shown in Fig. 5.1. In other words, when three streams progress independently and are combined at critical junctures, this combination creates an opportunity for agenda change. The problem stream means that policy decision-makers become interested in a specific policy problem among various problems. The stream of politics consists of the national mood, public opinion, election results, replacement of administration, lopsided or ideological distribution in a council, and pressure of interest groups. The political stream has a strong influence on setting a new agenda. The policy stream is the procedure to set various policy alternatives through the policy community including researchers, council workers, workers in planning, evaluating, and budgeting, and interest group analysts. Kingdon emphasized the importance of the political stream and policy entrepreneurs (Kingdon 2010).\n",

The Kyunghyang, the next day on the twenty-second, such as \u201ca bridge that even taxi drivers refused to go,\u201d \u201cmom crying over the dead body of her son on his birthday\u201d were published, and \u201cthe head office of Korean Japanese Community called and said it was embarrassing.\u201d Additionally, the Korean media focused on the bereaved families emotionally attacking anyone they perceived to be responsible or sobbing over the bodies of loved ones, while pushing for the punishment of the involved construction companies or \u201cpeople in charge\u201d rather than demanding more intense rescue attempts or enhanced disaster policy improvements. In contrast, American or Japanese media focused on rescue images while advocating for improved disaster policies (Korea Press and Foundation/Reporter Association of Korea 24th Reporter Forum 2003).

Also, while the investigation of the cause of the accident was proceeding, President Kim Young-Sam held a chief secretary meeting on October 23, and directed poor construction companies to be eliminated from the construction industry and called for construction-related laws to be revised so that maintenance and safety management periods of buildings could be extended. Also, he emphasized a continual check-up by establishing a thorough check-up system regarding roads, tunnels, and bridges as he noted that the risk of accident was everywhere (Dong-A Daily News\n1994). The next day, on October 24, the president made a special public statement through a national telecast. The statement contained several important issues. First, for the last 30 years of economic development, since 1960, there had been a positive outcome; but at the same time, there were negative outcomes such as the collapse of the Seongsu bridge. There was risk everywhere of similar types of accidents and incidents. Second, the government would like to promise to take all kinds of measures to minimize all risks existing in Korea. Third, the president gave an apology to the people with a mark that he would try hard to improve the maintenance and the innovation of the country as he recognized problems in the management system through the accident.",

The Chairman Park Woo-byung of the \u201cSampoong Department Store collapse Special Committee,\u201d summarized the report thus, \u201cthe accident was the result of poor management caused by a lack of construction, building, inspection, maintenance, and management, and a lack of supervision from the administrative office.\u201d The collapse began on the fifth floor, and the shock of the collapse caused a consecutive collapse to the whole building due to its weak superstructure. Also, through the investigation of the state administration, several problems were identified. First, there were problems in the progress of the construction such as lack of construction consistency, frequent construction changes, poor construction, and perfunctory inspections. Second, a lack of public officer\u2019s professionalism ignoring manuals, corruption, a lack of management and supervision of an administrative office, were the problems. The third problem was related to the control of the accident such as a lack of a command and control system, a failure of accident-site control, a lack of rescue equipment, a delay in rescue, poor first-aid treatment, confusion in counting missing people, and a weak management of dead bodies and debris.

After completion, it was revealed that public officers were given bribes and the Sampoong Department Store received a design change approval, which was an expedient. In fact, the actual design documents severely lacked pillar diameter, steel bar diameter, and its number compared to a structural bill. Also, employees were not fully equipped to calculate construction and had to use a poor design document that was randomly written by the construction company. This became one of the reasons the structure was left vulnerable. In addition, design documents were supposed to be completed before construction began; but in case of the Sampoong Department Store, there was no systematic construction management since the building owner frequently asked for design changes, and the construction company had to often turn in a design document by production process and by floor.Construction\n",

The NTSB found that a flight captain could not perform all the required tasks during approach adequately after investigating the flight, the communication with the control tower, and the rescue team, looking at the approach procedures, and consulting with the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board (KCAB) of MoCT, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Additionally, the NTSB found that the copilot and the flight engineer did not check their monitors and each other when the captain was trying the approach, the captain was fatigued, and the Korean Air flight attendants were inappropriately trained.

Also, the Home Affairs Committee of the National Assembly set up an administrative commission to identify the cause of the Chungju Dam overflow with the collapse of the Han River embankment. The problems identified were as follows: First, the conventional stream management was a dual system where the responsibilities were separated into the MoHA in charge of management and maintenance work and the MoC in charge of improvement and repair work of the stream. Second, there was an improper management and lack of risk management capacity at the MoHA. Therefore, the Countermeasures Against Storm and Flood Act was revised with additional articles since the Government Organization Act was amended by the Act No. 4268 on December 27, 1990, and the work on disaster prevention measures moved from the MoC to the MoHA.",
