            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact globally. Most affected, however, are those individuals and groups routinely disadvantaged by the social injustice created by the misdistribution of power, money, and resources. Simple measures that prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as frequent hand washing and social distancing, are unavailable to millions of people in the wealthiest of nations and in the poorest of nations. Disadvantaged groups are impacted more directly and in disproportionately higher numbers due to existing poor health, and the disruption of services central to securing an income and an education will have lasting consequences for their futures. The unintended effect of exclusionary government policies is that privileged citizens and healthcare systems are also at greater risk. This paper seeks to highlight the impact of COVID-19 on those already suffering health inequities through consideration of some of the social determinants of health on groups in affluent and poorer nations. It also highlights some of the factors that may assist in tackling health inequities as we emerge from this pandemic.",

Inequities both fuel the emergence of new public health challenges and result from them. (Blas and Sivasankara Kurup 2010, 4) The conditions in which people live out their lives from the womb to their death are collectively referred to as the social determinants of health and are socially and politically structured by the distribution of power, money, and resources (Marmot et al. 2008) . Leading world experts acknowledge that the systematic misdistribution of power, money, and resources fuels social injustice causing millions of people worldwide to die prematurely; they also acknowledge that we are all morally obliged to urgently reduce the health inequities experienced by millions-from governments to international agencies, the business sector, and civil society (Marmot et al. 2008) . The COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed that governments' unwillingness to invest in closing the glaring social gaps created by unjust policies has had costly and avoidable consequences in terms of both human life and economies.",

He relies on nothing more than luck to survive. This pandemic has exposed how reliant we all are on each other, how the health of the disadvantaged impacts on the advantaged, how events in one country impact on lives in others, how economies are impacted by the health of the people whose labour they rely on and on the health of those excluded from the labour market, and how we can only fight some battles standing united. With this renewed knowledge and insight, we can perhaps now address long-standing health inequities. Decisively, addressing the social determinants of health will involve local and international contributions, as health inequities exist locally, nationally, regionally, and globally. All sectors of society will need to play their part: from all areas of government (and not just health departments), the business sector, civil society, and local communities, as well as international agencies, such as the World Health Organization (Marmot et al. 2008) .",

The areas considered include the following: income and wealth, employment and access to health services, housing, food environment, education, and safety. Examples are given to highlight the way health inequities play out for different groups but it should be remembered throughout that one form of disadvantage often leads to being impacted by other forms. For example, inability to access education will most often impact on health, and life more broadly, in numerous direct and indirect ways at various stages of a person's life.",

For example, children that have experienced poverty are more likely to suffer higher mortality rates (particularly if poverty persists in adulthood), a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease, of stroke, and type II diabetes (Raphael 2011) . Exposure to other forms of childhood adverse experiences, such as family dysfunction and cohabiting with individuals who suffer mental illness or who abuse substances, also takes their toll on the health and well-being of a child right into adulthood (Loxton et al. 2019; Bellis et al. 2017 ). In the face of a pandemic such as COVID-19, groups systematically disadvantaged confront the virus with a health status already compromised compared with less disadvantaged groups (Bailey et al. 2017) . For example, Hispanic Americans and African Americans have succumbed to COVID-19 in disproportionately higher numbers (New York State Department of Health 2020; Yancy 2020) than their fellow Americans; at the time of writing, 34% of fatalities in New York City were Hispanics (29% of the total population) and 28% of fatalities were African Americans (22% of the total population) while 27% of fatalities were White (32% of the total population) (New York State Department of Health 2020, 19 April 2020).",

Exceptional measures have been taken in some countries (e.g. Australia) such as closing off communities and banning all travel unless it falls under limited restricted categories to ensure that indigenous communities are protected from COVID-19 (National Indigenous Australians Agency 2020; Department of Health, Australian Government 2020). Like other indigenous peoples, for example, communities of the APY Lands in South Australia are also at increased risk. The risk, however, is further amplified because the elders in these communities are also community leaders who hold much of the history and culture; hence, losing them would cause irreversible devastation to these communities (ABC News 2020). In contrast to the strategy adopted in Australia, the Brazilian Government has done nothing to protect numerous indigenous communities in the Amazon, many of which are now at grave risk of being decimated by the virus (Wallace 2020). In fact, the Bolsonaro Government has turned a blind eye to illegal practices such as mining and logging (Wallace 2020), practices which imperil these vulnerable indigenous communities (and the whole world) both during a pandemic and beyond such a crisis.",

Governments responded decisively offering a range of relief measures including unemployment benefits, which in some jurisdictions doubled overnight (Lawson 2020 ; Services Australia 2020) despite years of resistance to do so even when urged to by organisations such as The Australian Council of Social Service and the Business Council of Australia (Business Council of Australia 2012; Murphy 2020).",

In addition to increased exposure to the virus, these workers are also at higher risk because they are often unable to access free healthcare and paid sick leave, which could encourage them to continue working even if unwell (Parker 2020) . Even where jobs have survived, single-parent families with young children are potentially still at risk of losing their jobs, as social distancing measures preclude family members from looking after young children who cannot be left at home unattended. While holding a job during this crisis is life-saving for poorer families, the very fact that the bread winner is more exposed to contracting the disease also exposes whole families to this risk, which is particularly high when large or extended families occupy sub-optimal housing, as discussed below.",

The general population of many developed countries does not consume a sufficient variety of foods from the various food groups recommended by health authorities, often leading to the development of chronic conditions (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2018). For millions of people around the world, however, the concern is of a more urgent nature; there is simply not enough food. According to the World Food Programme, a staggering 821 million people are undernourished, i.e. '\u2026an individual's habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary energy required to maintain a normal, active, healthy life' (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO 2019, 189) . These people do not have the ability to secure access to food and hence suffer from what is widely known as 'food insecurity', which is also experienced by millions of people in prosperous countries, for example, by low income earners who are often of specific ethnic backgrounds and have a lower education (Gundersen and Ziliak 2015) , and unsurprisingly, homeless people (Crawford et al. 2014 ). In addition to creating a new category of people in need of emergency food because of job losses, this pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity experienced by disadvantaged groups in wealthier nations but also by those depending on international aid as a result of supply chain disruptions and movement restrictions.",

However, receiving an education can help curb such influences. For example, it has been suggested that cognitive functions such as reasoning, thinking, and problem-solving which education by its very nature entails provide a direct protective benefit, while indirect benefits accrue from educated students later having access to better jobs, more control over their lives, and a greater ability to make healthier life choices (Ross and Wu 1995) .",

Even where internet access and harware are not an issue, remote learning requires parental involvement and support, which is often not available in some families due to complex socioeconomic factors; it requires adequate dedicated space for study, an environment free of disruption, and multiple devices for families with more than one child. The absence of such features is sure to have a negative longterm impact on children already disadvantaged academically and socially with a subsequent impact on their health and well-being, especially if remote schooling extends over a long period. Children whose countries have not instituted closures may also be impacted adversely, as their parents may be reluctant to send them to school for fear of them contracting the disease (WFP, FAO, and UNICEF 2020) .",
