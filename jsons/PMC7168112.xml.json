Thus, plants were, besides animals, the basic bioproduction system for important bulk substances. Especially in the field of pharmaceuticals, plants offer a huge variety of secondary metabolites with many therapeutic effects. These substances, evolutionarily developed by plants to protect themselves against pathogens and predators or to attract pollinators,\n1\n exhibit wound\u2010healing, anti\u2010inflammatory, antimicrobial, or psychoactive properties. They can be used to protect and maintain human and animal health. Modern biotechnological methods to produce these therapeutics in a controlled and predictable manner encompass cell cultures initiated from the respective medicinal plants. This sometimes is the only possibility for the large\u2010scale production of these substances since the original plant species often are difficult to cultivate and are rare in nature. Successful examples for this kind of bioproduction are the alkaloids,\n2\n paclitaxel,\n3\n and shikonin.\n4\n\n",

            "text": "To date, the bacterial fermentation is the best\u2010characterized and most cost\u2010effective production system. However, because of the procaryotic nature of the organisms, a eucaryotic type of protein processing is poorly developed and the production is limited to simple structures (peptides, small proteins) where posttranslational modifications are absent or unimportant for the biologic activity. Moreover, high protein accumulation often results in aggregation (inclusion bodies), thus, laborious renaturation steps are needed to recover the proteins in their biologically active form. The overall yield, however, remains relatively low, ranging from 100 to 1,500 mg/L.\n12\n Another point to consider is the bacterial toxins that have to be eliminated during downstream processing. Yeasts as eucaryotic organisms avoid some of these disadvantages, but the practical experiences show a high amount of product loss due to degradation of the target protein in the medium. Moreover, especially S. cerevisiae tends to hyperglycosylate the produced proteins what results in N\u2010glycans of high\u2010mannose structure, which are totally different from the mammalian or human structures of N\u2010glycans. These critical points can be improved by using P. pastoris as expression system.\n13\n Here, a protein yield up to 6.4 g/L could be obtained,\n14\n although the average protein yield is 100\u2013200 mg/L.\n13\n Despite these limitations, 43% of the current biologics on the market are produced in bacteria and yeasts. The majority of the biologics (57%), however, is produced in different mammalian cell cultures (e.g., NS0, BHK, CHO). As cell types most similar to their human counterpart, these systems offer the highest yield of functional recombinant protein with correct N\u2010glycosylation and other posttranslational modifications. The yield typically ranges between 1 and 3 g/L.\n12\n This \u201cgolden standard,\u201d however, requires expensive infrastructure and media components. Additionally, the risk of viral or oncogenic contamination is given. This leads to reasonably high overall production costs, ranging from 300 to 10,000 USD/g, depending of the quantity of the protein produced.\n15\n\n",

If transgenic seed material can be supplied to the market in sufficient quantities, farming will rely on the well\u2010established, low\u2010cost agricultural infrastructure. The acreage of planted transgenic plants can be adopted to meet altered quantity demands from one year to another without additional costs. Taking into account an average protein yield of 0.5\u20131 g per kg fresh weight, Fischer and coworkers\n26\n calculate that 1 hectare of tobacco plants would result in 100 tons of fresh material per year. From this, 50 kg of sIgA or 100 kg of recombinant glucocerebrosidase can be harvested. Thus, the relatively low protein yield, which is a general feature of transgenic plants compared to other expression systems, can be compensated easily by the huge quantity of generated biomass. Moreover, the downstream processing costs may also be diminished because there is no need to downgrade any bacterial toxins or human pathogenic particles (viruses, toxins, prions) existing in animal production systems. Taking these unique features into account, the costs for the resulting proteins have been calculated to be below 50 USD per gram.\n27\n\n",

This entire pathway cannot be transferred to another plant. In contrast, proteins are encoded by only one or very few genes that can be inserted and expressed in virtually any host plant. This gives much more freedom to operate, but, on the other hand, leads to a vast variety of possible host plants and expression strategies for the production of recombinant proteins. There is not one clear advantageous, leading plant expression system, although the well\u2010established crop species are preferably used, including tobacco, rice, and corn.\n15\n, \n18\n Depending on the biologic and economic requirements of one specific target protein, one is free to choose the most suitable plant expression system. There are two basic strategies for the expression: transient expression or stably transformed plants. Transient expression has some advantages since this technique does not result in transgenic plants with its ecologic or regulatory concerns. Moreover, a reasonable amount of protein can be obtained within few days after infection.\n28\n The transient expression can be achieved using infiltration of whole plants or plant parts (e.g., leaves) with Agrobacterium tumefaciens.\n29\n, \n30\n This results in lab\u2010scale quantities of protein in the milligram range for feasibility or preclinical studies. In another transient expression strategy, the target gene is fused to the coat protein gene of plant viruses, for example, tobacco mosaic virus, and the thus altered virus is used for plant infection.\n28\n This technique is used commercially for large\u2010scale protein production in open\u2010field plants, for example, by Large Scale Biology's Geneware\u00ae technology\n31\n and Icon Genetics's MagICON\u00ae technology.\n32\n Transgenic plants, on the other hand, require a longer time for the generation and characterization of production lines and the generation of a sufficient amount of seed material. But after this, an almost unlimited and sustainable production capacity can be reached using the established agricultural infrastructure. This strategy is already applied commercially using bulk crop plants like tobacco, corn, rice, or soybean\n15\n, \n18\n or special plant species like soapworts (Saponin Inc., Saskatoon, Canada), safflower (SemBioSys Genetics Inc., Calgary, Alberta Canada), or alfalfa (Medicago Inc., Quebec Canada). An alternative to open\u2010field plants is the cultivation of the transgenic plants in greenhouses, which enables more controlled production conditions, but increases the production costs. This decision depends on the quantity demand of the target protein and the regulatory issues of the specific country in terms of release of transgenic plants into the environment and GMP requirements of the production process.",

Depending on the safety and mass requirements, these organisms can be held in contained in vitro cultures, in controlled greenhouse containers, or in open ponds of any size for bulk biomass production.

            "text": "In most cases, the target protein is expressed in the whole plant and the gene is driven by constitutive promoters, for example, CaMV 35S or mas promoter without any regulation. This is to reach the maximum protein yield. But the temporal and spatial regulation of transgene expression within the plant can be advantageous for specific applications. This regulation is reached by the use of plant promoters that are active only in a specific plant organ or time frame within the plant's life. If the transgene is expressed constitutively in the whole plant, the recombinant protein has to be extracted right after the plant harvest and the crude protein extract or the purified protein has to be distributed under elaborate conditions in a cooling chain. In contrast, targeting the expression to one of the plant storage organs leads to an accumulation of the resulting protein exclusively in these plant parts. Here, the protein remains stable and active at ambient temperature for an extended time span. After harvest, the organs can be stored and transported without any cooling or stabilization and can be extracted at a place distant from the harvesting location. The target storage organs mostly were seeds (cereals, corn) or tubers (potato). This strategy is applied successfully to several technical proteins and enzymes and is also considered for therapeutic protein production.\n40\n To make protein production in plants more safe and controllable, it can be useful to put the target gene under the control of an inducible promoter. This avoids transgenic plants containing recombinant protein on the field and the deliberate induction of gene expression enables protein production after the harvest right before extraction. This possibility successfully has been applied using a stress\u2010inducible promoter (MeGA\u2122 promoter) in tobacco by CropTech Corp (Blacksburg, VA, USA).\n41\n Here, the foreign gene expression is induced by chopping the freshly harvested tobacco plants under contained conditions. In another strategy, a germination\u2010specific promoter drives gene expression in barley seeds. After harvest and storage of the seed granules, the protein production can be induced at the desired time point and place by germinating (malting) the granules. This technique is proprietary of MALTagen GmbH (Andernach, Germany).",

At the current state of the art, the targeting of all intracellular compartments is feasible using known signal sequences that can be fused to the target gene. The intracellular locations that have been tested and compared for foreign protein production include cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the apoplastic space, the vacuole, and the chloroplast (see below). Several studies have been performed to compare the efficacy of protein production using cytoplasmic, ER, and apoplastic accumulation in tobacco\n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n or rice.\n45\n Conclusive, ER targeting gives rise to the highest yield of biologically active protein. In contrast, cytosolic expression mostly leads only to poor protein yield. The reason is that the ER contains many important posttranslational protein maturation elements like chaperones, protein\u2010disulfide isomerase, and glycosylation enzymes in a reducing environment. These features are not at all or scarcely present in the cytosol. Vacuolar targeting and secretion into the apoplastic space is also coupled with ER/Golgi passage and the above\u2010mentioned maturation and stabilization properties. However, the protein yield often is found to be diminished compared to ER accumulation, probably due to unfavorable protein stability properties of these compartments.",

After the generation of fully homotransplastomic plants by repeated rounds of selection, the protein yield reaches up to 46.1% total leaf protein\n46\n and, thus, is superior to all other transgenic expression strategies with regard to protein yield. This results from the high copy number of the chloroplast genome and of the integrated transgene coupled with high transcription rates. Some more advantages render the chloroplastic expression of foreign genes to a promising strategy to compete with other nonplant expression systems regarding protein yield: Due to the procaryotic nature of the chloroplasts, it is possible to transfer whole polycistrons with several genes under the same regulation and to get their coordinate expression. Moreover, homologous recombination is feasible to integrate genes into specific genome sites without gene silencing or position effects, which leads to reduced variability in expression levels of the introduced transgene. Finally, the plants lack transgenic pollen due to the maternal inheritance of the chloroplast genome. The only disadvantage that results from the procaryotic organelle character is the decreased ability for necessary posttranslational modifications present in the ER. Thus, the range of proteins that can be obtained in a biologically active manner from chloroplast transformation is limited similarly to the bacterial expression systems. The chloroplast transformation was first established in tobacco, but the range of transformable plant species is increasing in recent years, including cotton,\n48\n soybean,\n49\n oilseed rape,\n50\n tomato,\n51\n and potato.\n52\n A growing number of therapeutic relevant proteins have been expressed using this strategy, including interferon gamma\n53\n vaccines\n54\n, \n55\n, \n56\n and other therapeutic relevant proteins.\n46\n This production strategy has already been commercialized, for example, by Chlorogen, Inc.

These subunit vaccines are another class of therapeutic proteins that can actively be expressed using plants.\n57\n An alternative vaccine delivery to reach an active immunization efficiently is oral or nasal exposure of the vaccines to mucosal tissue of nose, throat, and gut. Here, the vaccines elicit the mucosal (sIgA) as well as systemic (IgG) immune response.\n58\n These findings paved the road to a very fascinating combination of medicine and plant science: The plants expressing oral vaccines do not only serve as the production system but at the same time as delivery vehicle for the vaccines. Oral immunization simply can be achieved by eating edible plant parts expressing the subunit vaccine gene. This enormously simplifies delivery and administration and reduces the production costs, since any kind of downstream processing and protein purification is unnecessary.

Although no calculation of overall production costs using plant cell cultures can be found in literature, these systems promise to be more cost effective. This is due to the simple media using cheaper medium components (mostly inorganic salts and sucrose) and the lack of human pathogenic particles that have to be eliminated in the downstream processing. As a first estimation, plant cell cultures cannot compete with transgenic plants in open\u2010field cultivation with regard to production costs, but still promise to be more cost\u2010effective than mammalian cell cultures.
