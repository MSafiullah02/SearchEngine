HCoVs are difficult to detect, and epidemiological data are rare. From October 2000 through April 2001, we tested 1803 respiratory samples for HCoV by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. From 8 February through 27 March 2001, HCoV OC43 was detected in samples obtained from 30 (6%) of 501 patients. The other viruses detected were respiratory syncytial virus (6.1%), parainfluenza virus 3 (1%), influenza virus A (7.8%), influenza virus B (7.2%), rhinovirus (6.4%), enterovirus (1%), and adenovirus (2%). Infection with HCoV OC43 was detected in patients of all age groups. The following clinical symptoms were noted: fever (in 59.8% of patients), general symptoms (in 30%), digestive problems (in 56.8%), rhinitis (in 36.6%), pharyngitis (in 30%), laryngitis (in 3.3%), otitis (in 13.3%), bronchitis (in 16.6%), bronchiolitis (in 10%), and pneumonia (in 6.6%).

In addition to being associated with the common cold syndrome, HCoVs are also associated with more-severe respiratory infections [1] [2] [3] . HCoVs are divided into 2 distinct antigenic groups, each of which is represented by a prototype virus: HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43. Results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the 1970s have led to the conclusion that these viruses are worldwide in distribution and circulate during seasonal outbreaks [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, there have not been studies that have described an outbreak of respiratory coronavirus infection in detail. This is probably because of the difficulties in detecting coronaviruses by culture isolation, search for intracellular antigens, or serological methods. Therefore, we developed molecular techniques to diagnose coronavirus infection. The aim of this surveillance study is to describe an outbreak of HCoV OC43 infection in Normandy, France, in February and March 2001. Laboratory methods for the detection of viruses. The conventional methods used for fresh specimens included the following: the virus isolation technique (VIT) with MRC5 and MDCK cells, with use of procedures reported elsewhere; and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of nasal smears using monoclonal antibodies (Imagen) to influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, RSV, and adenovirus [8] . Molecular techniques to detect rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus in frozen samples were performed using previously reported procedures [9, 10] and the usual precautions to avoid contamination with PCR products. In brief, the primers and probes used for HCoVs 229E and OC43 were selected from reported sequences of the M gene. RT-PCR was performed with the DNA Enzyme Immunoassay (GEN-ETI-K DEIA; Sorin). The assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. All borderline results were tested using a second molecular technique with primers and probes located in another gene (gene N), to exclude the possible contamination of amplified products [11] . In addition, 20 amplified products in gene M were sequenced (Genopole/E.S.G.S) and compared with the prototype strain OC43 (EACC no. 86040306) and the strain referenced in GenBank (accession number M93390).

Because coronaviruses usually cause a respiratory illness indistinguishable from that caused by many other viruses, it is not possible to recognize the clinical aspects of HCoV infection in the absence of laboratory diagnosis. Most investigators have used serological techniques to evaluate the role of coronaviruses in respiratory diseases [4] [5] [6] [7] . Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect humans and animals, and the total number of serological types that infect humans has not yet been defined. The assumption must be made that the 2 types described above, HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43, are typical of the other viruses. The incidence and the prevalence of coronavirus infection and its geographic and temporal distribution have been studied in several reports, mainly in the United States. Coronavirus infection seems to be rare outside of the period from December through May. There was a cyclical pattern to coronavirus infection noted in all longitudinal studies for both HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43, with outbreaks of infection occurring every 2 to 4 years [4, 5, 12] . The outbreak of HCoV OC43 respiratory infection observed in Normandy in February and March 2001 is consistent with these epidemiological data. No cases of infection due to HCoV 229E were detected by molecular techniques during this period. Similarly, coronavirus respiratory infection affected patients of all age groups; this correlates well with the reported data that show that there is no decrease in the rates of coronavirus infection as patient age increases.
