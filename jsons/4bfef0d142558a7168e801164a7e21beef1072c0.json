A comprehensive and timely review summarized the scientific research in estimating the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) released from 1 January to 7 February 2020 [1] . During the early outbreak, when the key epidemiological features of COVID-19 were uncovered, the R 0 estimation largely relied on the growth rate of the epidemic curve and the estimation of the serial interval (SI). Here, we demonstrated that an overlarge SI would lead to overestimation of R 0 . We adopted the growing process proposed in [2] deterministically with a population of 11 million in Wuhan, 1 case initially onset on 5 December 2019 and a fixed step at 1 day. We consider two values of the mean serial interval (SI) that are \uf0b7 SI at 4.6 days estimated based on 28 records of transmission chains [3] , which was largely consistent with the SI estimate at 4.4 days based on 71 records [4] ; and \uf0b7 SI at 8 days, which was closer to the SI of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 8.4 days), SI of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 7.6 days).",
