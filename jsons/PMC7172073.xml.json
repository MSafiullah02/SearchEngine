            "text": "Heparin sodium is the purified sodium salt of heparin, a high molecular weight polysaccharide derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. Heparin sodium, or more frequently its derivative, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), is used as a class of anticoagulant medications [1]. Porcine heparin is prepared either from porcine intestinal mucosa or from whole minced gut. One pig is necessary to manufacture three doses of purified heparin or one dose of LMWH, and around 100 tons of heparin are manufactured every year [2]. The worldwide demand for both heparin sodium and LMWH has increased over the last few years, and currently, more than 20 million pigs worldwide are used for its manufacture each year. The raw material is likely to be rich in enteric viruses which are generally excreted at high titers, and which are often resistant to many physical and chemical treatments, therefore any recipient human patients could theoretically be exposed to porcine viruses. Moreover, increasing knowledge of the porcine enteric virome has so far uncovered greater viral diversity than previously thought [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [22]. The heparin manufacturing process involves numerous steps [1], each of which must undergo verification for their efficacy in either inactivating or removing viruses, according to current regulations. To help build contamination risk analyses, and to establish which viruses should be monitored, investigations must be undertaken to determine those viruses likely to contaminate the raw material, and their respective viral loads.",

            "text": "A total of 10 mucus pool samples were collected in Europe, reflecting the diversity of the slaughterhouses utilized by a single manufacturer over several months. Each pool represented several hundreds of pigs and corresponded to the raw material used for pure heparin sodium manufacturing. 1 mL of each mucus sample was mixed with 9 mL of N-acetyl cysteine (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, vortexed, centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter and the virus particles of each pool were independently concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 100,000 g through a cushion of 30% w/v sucrose. The pellet was resuspended in 150 \u03bcL of water and treated with a cocktail of nucleases adapted from metagenomic study of gut contents to digest non particle-protected nucleic acids (Turbo DNase (final concentration, 20 U/ml; Ambion) and RNase A (final concentration, 0.1 mg/ml; Fermentas) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min) [17]. Enzymes were inactivated with a final concentration of 3 mM EDTA and heating at 10 min at 65 \u00b0C. The virus particles-associated genomes contained in 80 \u03bcL of each mucus pool sample were extracted with the Cador Qiagen Pathogen minikit (Hilden) and then amplified by the bacteriophage phi29 polymerase based multiple displacement amplification (MDA) assay using random primers. This technique allows DNA synthesis from DNA samples, and also from cDNA fragments from viral genomes previously colligated prior to Phi29 polymerase-MDA [18]. A mix with 4 \u03bcl of nucleic acids, 0.5 \u03bcl of primer (50 \u03bcM) and 0.5 \u03bcl of dNTPs (10 mM) was incubated at 75 \u00b0C for 5 min and cooled on ice for 5 min. Then, 5 \u03bcl of enzyme mix were added. This enzyme mix was composed of 2 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 RT Buffer for SSIII (Invitrogen Inc. Saint Aubin, France), 4 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 \u03bcl of 0.1 M DTT, 1 \u03bcl of 40 U/\u03bcl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen Inc., Saint Aubin, France), 1 \u03bcl of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Inc.). The final mix was incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 10 min, then at 45 \u00b0C for 90 min and finally at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. The two following steps (ligation and MDA) were performed with the QuantiTect\u00ae Whole Transcriptome kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each of the ten samples provided concatemers of high molecular weight DNA at a concentration close to 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL that were pooled before sequencing. Sample extraction and random amplification procedures were carefully performed to prevent cross-contamination, using the best precautionary PCR standards.",

Members of the Parvoviridae family represented 76.3% of total viral reads, and within this group members of the bocavirus genus represented 79.5% of these Parvoviridae reads, followed by Partetravirus genus members (13.8%), as shown in Fig. 2\n.

Detailed results are presented in Supplementary Table S1. We identified potential novel viral species in the Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, and Reoviridae families. The most frequent reads corresponded to members of the Parvoviridae family, and were distantly related (around 64% amino acid identity) to known parvoviruses. The most closely related was the Eidolon helvum parvovirus 2, an unclassified member of the partetravirus genus found in frugivore bats of Africa [21]. This suggests the presence of at least one new porcine parvovirus species that we have tentatively named porcine parvovirus 7.

We identified members of the Circoviridae and Parvoviridae families as the major mucus-contaminating viruses. The fecal pig virome, which in theory should be similar to the mucosal virome, was examined recently via HTS and our findings were similar in relation to the main virus families identified. Nevertheless, the proportion of each virus family generally differed, which could perhaps be due to variation between animals, where studies were conducted on individual pigs from one or a limited number of herds [5], [6]. It should be emphasized that most of the identified viruses were not porcine pathogens. For example, whilst PCV2 (the main detected species) is responsible for the post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [23], PCV1 seems to be non-pathogenic. Porcine bocaviruses are diverse and have not yet been associated with disease [24], [25]. These are interesting findings, as most testing guidelines for the viral safety of biological products are dominated by the search for porcine pathogens. This is evidently due to bias as veterinary virology is dominated by research on animal diseases. Indeed, most of the zoonotic viruses infecting humans are either weakly, or not at all pathogenic in their animal reservoir. Therefore we should remain cautious about predicting the impact of such \u201cnon-pathogenic\u201d animal viruses on human health. Moreover, we mainly detected positive-ssRNA or -ssDNA viruses, which are known to harbor marked capabilities in adapting to new hosts following successful initial cross-transmission events. On the other hand, we did not detect viruses known to be transmissible to humans, such as influenza [26], HEV [27] and EMCV [28], while the zoonotic status of some of the identified viruses (rotavirus [29] and norovirus [30]) are still the subject of fierce debate.",

So, it seems unlikely that a high load of a virus able to challenge the drastic manufacturing process of heparin could escape detection.

Also, the coverage of the viral genomes is generally not uniform [13]. So, it is currently impossible to estimate virus loads from NGS results. Due to the study's objective and the resultant viral diversity, we decided to focus quantitative analysis on a subset of those viruses which may be especially resilient to removal or inactivation during the manufacturing process i.e. Circoviridae and Parvoviridae. Both are very resistant to physical and chemical inactivation, and in addition, are the smallest of vertebrate viruses (17\u201324 nm and 18\u201326 nm respectively), and thus are the most difficult to clear by nanofiltration. Among the Parvoviridae, we chose two species: porcine bocavirus, representing 79.5% of Parvoviridae reads, and the new PPV7 virus, to model unknown viruses which would not have been detected using current PCR methods. Circoviruses and the two parvoviruses were present in 9/10 batches (PPV7 was not detected in batch 10). Viral loads were high and remarkably similar between batches, which is probably a consequence of frequent shedding and the large size of the tested pools (several hundred pigs), which probably averages out viral loads. The ten mucus batches contained between 7.6 and 8.5 log gc/mL of several non-enveloped small DNA viruses, which represents severe challenges for downstream purification processes.",
