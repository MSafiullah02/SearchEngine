ADE is consideredto bea significant obstacle todevelopingeffectivevaccinesformany virusesforwhich ADE has been reported,sincevirusspecific antibodies of maternal origin or those conferred by vaccination can facilitate the entry of the virus into target cells, sometimes resulting in increased severity of the disease. In this study, the role of specific PRRS viral epitopes in ADE and/or virus neutralization (VN) was assessed in vitro using 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 4 PRRS viral proteins: nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), glycoprotein (GP) 5, and GP3. Each mAb recongnized a distinct epitope on one of these proteins. One-way ADE and VN assays were performed in vitro using homologous PRRS virus isolates in the presence or absence of each mAb. ADE activity was determined by detecting a significant increase of progeny virus yield in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures in the presence of individual mAbs. Neutralizing activity was determined by detecting a significant reduction or complete blocking of virus replication in MARC-145 cells in the presence ofindividual mAbs. mAbs could be categorized into 3 groups: enhancing, neutralizing and neither. Viral epitopes which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies appeared to reside on the M, GP3 and GP5 proteins, while epitopes that may induce ADE-mediating antibody were associated with the N and GP5 proteins. Identification of the viral proteins and antigens and epitopes responsible for ADE-and VN-mediating antibodies may provide the basis for developing efficacious second-generation vaccines for the control of PRRS virus; yet, further epitope mapping remains to be done. #", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "For over a decade, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been a disease of great significance to the swine industry since it first appeared as catastrophic clinical outbreaks in swine herds in North America and Europe in the late 1980s Wensvoort et al., 1991) .

Theoretically, such observations are possible if naked or partially stripped viruses containing intact infectious RNA were in the virus preparation used for the assay, which is likely since the virus material used in our study was not purified through zonal centrifugation. However, it also has been demonstrated that the requirement of intact infectious virions for infection in permissive cells can be bypassed through ADE pathway for virus entry (Mason et al., 1994) . Consequently, our observation on ISU15E may have a significant implication in the pathogenesis of PRRSV. The 15 kD N protein is known to be highly immunogenic, and abundant expression of ORF 7 (the gene encoding for the N protein) in the early stage of infection has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Bautista et al., 1996; Loemba et al., 1996; Mardassi et al., 1994; Yoon et al., 1996) . Likewise, it has also been reported that high levels of non-neutralizing antibody, most of which is specific for the N protein, are produced in pigs following exposure (Nelson et al., 1994; Yoon et al., 1996) . Subsequently, PRRSV could take advantage of ADE for entry to target cells (i.e., macrophages or macrophage-lineage cells).

All of these factors were taken into consideration for the study, including isotype determination. All mAbs used were of the IgG1 subtype, thus, any results from ADE or neutralization assays described in the present study are independent of the immunoglobulin isotype/ subtype and a property intrinsic to the epitope bound. Although all isotypes of murine IgG were shown to be capable of enhancing virus infection to macrophages of murine origin (Morens et al., 1987a) , our observations of ADE of PRRSV infection to PAM by mAbs of the IgG1 subtype are distinct from results of previous studies on ADE of FIPV infection to macrophages of feline origin by mAbs. Corapi et al. evaluated the ability of 19 mAbs specific for the S envelope protein of FIPV to induce ADE of infection in feline peritoneal macrophages (Corapi et al., 1992) . All mAbs were capable of neutralizing the ability of the virus to infect a permissive cell line. Fifteen of 19 mAbs induced ADE of infection in macrophages and all but one were of the IgG2a subclass. The remaining four mAbs that did not induce ADE of infection were IgG1. The difference in the isotypes between neutralizing mAbs that induced ADE and those that did not induce ADE suggests that there might be a restriction in the subclasses capable of mediating ADE of virus infection. It is also possible that the difference in the ability of FIPV-specific murine IgG isotypes to mediate ADE of infection is due to differences in the binding affinity of murine isotypes to FcR on feline macrophages (Hohdatsu et al., 1994) .
