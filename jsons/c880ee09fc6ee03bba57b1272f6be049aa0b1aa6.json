First, the individ ual with ADHD should not have a personal history of shortness of breath on exertion compared with peers; fainting on exertion or in response to fright or noise; excessive palpitations, breathlessness or syncope (at rest or after exercise) or palpitations that are rapid, regular, and start and stop suddenly (fleeting occasional bumps are usually ectopic and do not need investigation); chest pain suggesting cardiac origin; or any previously documented hypertension, congenital heart abnormality, previous cardiac surgery, or underlying condition that increases the risk of having a structural cardiac disorder (eg, genetic conditions or multisystemic disorders). 2 The second condition is that the individual with ADHD does not have a family history of early (<40 years) sudden death in a firstdegree relative suggesting cardiac disease. Finally, the patient must have baseline monitoring before initiation; blood pressure and heart rate can be measured by a family member or another person remotely (with telephonic assistance, if needed) on three separate occasions (details are provided in the appendix of our previous Comment 1 ).",
