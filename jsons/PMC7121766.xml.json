The patient succumbed to renal failure 18 days after the procedure. There were many subsequent attempts, but it was not until 1983 at the University of Toronto that Dr. Joel Cooper performed the first successful long-term lung transplant. Dr. Denton Cooley attempted the first heart-lung transplantation in a child in 1968. The patient was a 2 month old with pulmonary hypertension and a complete AV canal, but they only survived for 14 hours. The first successful isolated lung transplant in a child was performed at theUniversity of Toronto in 1987 in a 16 year old boy with pulmonary fibrosis. The 1990s witnessed a rapid growth in the number of pediatric lung transplants performed annually. However, unlike lung transplantation in adults, that growth has not continued in the 2000s. At present, there areapproximately 100 lung transplants done worldwide per year in children.",

The indications in childhood vary by age. Pulmonary hypertension, secondary to congenital heart disease or other pulmonary vascular disorders, is the leading indication in infancy followed by interstitial lung disease, including surfactant protein abnormalities. For older children and adolescents cystic fibrosis (CF) accounts for half tothree quarters of all lung transplant procedures. Although the most common diagnoses for children receiving lung transplants are listed in Table 74.1 determining which children may benefit from lung transplantation is often not as straightforward. In addition, determining the appropriate time to proceed is often challenging. Transplant physicians thoughtfully gage when a patient has entered the transplant window. This is the point intime where the patient is sick enough to warrant lung transplantation but not so sick that the odds of a good outcome have markedly deteriorated. Multiple variables must be carefully considered including the trajectory of the underlying disease. Lung transplantation is a procedure of last resort and, when performed, should provide the patient with not only an improved likelihood of survival over theirunderlying disease but also an improvement in their quality of life.",

On the basis of this classification, severe PGD (PaO2/FiO2 <200 at 48 hours post-transplant) occurs in 15% of recipients, which is concerning as severe PGD is associated with increased graft failure and mortality. Management of severe PGD is similar to the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including fluid restriction while maintaining perfusion to end organs, lung protective ventilator strategies, and nitric oxide.

The most common complication is seizures, generally felt to be related to calcineurin inhibitor induced cerebral vasoconstriction. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can also be seen. PRES consists of seizure activity in 92% of cases, along with headaches, visual abnormalities, nausea/vomiting,other focal neurological signs, and varying degrees of impaired consciousness, ranging from confusion, somnolence, and lethargy to encephalopathy or coma. The diagnosis requires both symptoms and neuroimaging findings, with MRI being superior to CT scan for identifying PRES. Consultation with a neurologist is also recommended; however, long-term medication is not generally needed for seizures related to lung transplantation. Hypertension can be present and contributory, and should be managed accordingly. While calcineurin inhibitor toxicity is felt to contribute to both seizures and PRES, the correlation with levels and severity or incidence is incomplete. Although some patients respond to switchingCNI (i.e., from tacrolimus to cyclosporine or vice versa) or alternative regimens, no general recommendation exists.",

Early renal failure suggests pre-transplant renal insufficiency. Thus, measurement of glomerular filtration rate is a mandatory aspect of pre-transplant evaluation, as patients with GFR <50 have a suspected risk for poor outcomes, and it thus represents a contraindication to transplant at some centers. Chronic effects of exposure to CNI and resulting renal vasoconsctriction contributes significantly to renal insufficiency and renovascular hypertension post-transplant. Generally, this is managed with calcium channel blockers. Five years of CNI based immunosuppression carries a 2.3% incidence of renal failure requiring dialysis, and 1% require renal transplantation at some point post-transplant.",

Data suggest that patients re-transplanted at least 1 year after their primary transplant had better outcomes, but the numbers of re-transplants are too small to make a definitive conclusion.

One such area is the expansion of donor lung availabilityusing ex vivo lung perfusion. In this procedure, marginal donor lungs that are not accepted for transplant initially are ventilated and perfused ex vivo and allowed to recover. Lungs have been successfully transplanted this way, and expanding the donor pool provides the opportunity to save patients that still, at present, die waiting for organs. This procedure needs to be extended into children as soon as possible. Another such area is the use ofpumpless oxygenators as a bridge to lung transplantation. In conventional ECMO, a pump takes blood from the patient, into the oxygenator then returns it. Recently, pumpless oxygenator systems have been used in candidates awaiting lung transplantation (i.e., NovaLung). While pediatric specific systems are still being developed, we have used a neonatal membrane oxygenator (Quadrox) to successfully bridge an infant suffering from alveolar capillary dysplasia to transplant. Both pumpless oxygenators and venovenous ECMO are being increasingly used as ways to less invasively bridge candidates to transplant for longer periods of time than conventional ECMO, which requires significant sedation, mechanical ventilation, and immobility, which while buying some time, also leads to progression of the primary lung disease, all of which limit the time a candidate can be bridged on conventional ECMO. Last, an array of anti-cytokine therapeutic antibodies being developed for other therapeutic indications (i.e., anti-IL-13, anti-IL-5R, anti-IL-17, and others) provide an opportunity to manipulate these mediators, all seen in different forms and stages of lung transplant rejection, in order to treat or prevent rejection, and potentially to promote engraftment.",

Multicenter trials should become the standard in lung transplantation as they have in many other indications. In pediatrics, the International Pediatric Lung Transplant Collaborative works to make this a reality.
