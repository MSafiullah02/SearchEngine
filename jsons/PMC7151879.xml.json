Guinea pigs are native to mountainous regions of South America where they were domesticated as long as 3000 years ago. Wild species of guinea pigs, or cavies, still inhabit Columbia, Peru, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Domesticated cavies in these countries are used for food. In the wild, guinea pigs live in small groups and, therefore, are often more comfortable in the presence of other guinea pigs when maintained as companion animals.",

Wire-bottom cages may also be used; however, care must be taken to ensure that the mesh is small enough that a limb cannot become entrapped. An area of solid flooring should be provided, as uninterrupted time on wire mesh may predispose the guinea pig to pododermatitis. Adequate space is needed in the enclosure for the guinea pig to move about unencumbered with enough space for a hide box. Hide boxes or a secluded space is required for prey species (e.g., rodents) to reduce stress that may lead to disease problems. Substrate products that contain aromatic oils (e.g., cedar and pine shavings) should not be used, as they can act as contact and respiratory irritants. Appropriate bedding materials include recycled newspaper products, shredded paper, and aspen shavings. The enclosure should be cleaned thoroughly on a regular basis (e.g., 2 times per week) because unsanitary conditions predispose the guinea pig to pododermatitis, respiratory, and other health problems. If housed indoors, guinea pig enclosures do not require a cover, as these animals do not typically jump or climb. However, the sides of the enclosure should be high enough to prevent escape (approximately 25 cm).2 Heavy food containers are recommended to make dumping of the receptacle more difficult. All food containers should be easy to disinfect and cleaned regularly, as guinea pigs have a habit of soiling their food bowls. Most guinea pigs readily accept drinking water from a sipper bottle, which will decrease spillage and will keep feces, urine, and bedding from contaminating the water.",

Although commercial guinea pig pellets are manufactured with vitamin C, the supplement often degrades rapidly, especially if the pellets are subjected to high heat and humidity. Vitamin C placed in drinking water also degrades rapidly and should be changed daily. To ensure that a guinea pig is receiving a proper amount of vitamin C, it is necessary to supplement a diet of pellets and hay with plenty of fresh foods or often a specifically manufactured vitamin C supplement tablet (Oxbow, Inc., Murdock, NE). Many green, leafy vegetables, such as kale, mustard greens, dandelion greens, parsley, and many others, are excellent sources of ascorbic acid (Box 17-1\n).

Auscultation of gut sounds is also an important part of the guinea pig physical exam. A healthy guinea pig should have 1 to 2 borborygmi per minute. The practitioner should keep in mind that stress will decrease gastrointestinal (GI) motility; therefore, a stressed animal will often have a decrease in borborygmi. Structures normally found on abdominal palpation include kidneys, urinary bladder, cecum, and intestines. Fecal pellets are often palpable in the colon. Careful examination may reveal the presence of abnormalities such as GI distention, masses, or, in females, ovarian cysts.

Heterophils lack myeloperoxidase, the enzyme that causes purulent, liquid exudates. Therefore, the debris contained in guinea pig abscesses is often found to be very thick and caseous, a fact that must be understood when treating these conditions. A normal guinea pig white blood cell differential will consist of primarily heterophils and lymphocytes, usually with a greater proportion of lymphocytes. The remaining leukocyte types (e.g., monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) are normally present in very low numbers. Early stages of a guinea pig's inflammatory response are often characterized by a shift in the differential white cell ratio (e.g., increased heterophils, decreased lymphocytes) rather than an increase in total leukocyte count. This ratio shift makes evaluating the entire leukogram essential for health evaluation (Box 17-3\n). The platelet count is also an important marker of inflammation in guinea pigs and other small mammal species. Large increases in the platelet count (>1,000,000/ml) can be seen without an increase in the total white blood cell count.BOX 17-3Example of an inflammatory leukogram in a guinea pig\n\n",

Abnormal oral examination findings may include an uneven occlusal surface or angle of the cheek teeth, formation of sharp points with or without associated ulceration of the oral mucosa, food impaction, and abnormal spaces (diastema) between teeth.

Infection with this organism is more commonly described in small rodents such as mice and hamsters, although it has also been described in guinea pigs as well as other mammalian groups.11 Tyzzer's disease often presents acutely, with signs such as diarrhea, depression, and poor coat quality, often progressing rapidly to death. Transmission is via the fecal-oral route. Guinea pigs can be infected with C. piliforme without showing clinical signs. Animals that are carrying the organism but showing no signs of illness have still been found to shed organisms.12 Animals that carry the organism and then become immunocompromised (e.g., stress, immunosuppressive drug therapy) often develop clinical disease.",

Confirmation of the diagnosis can be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence diagnostic tests, or culture of exudates.24 Treatment/preventive options for B. bronchiseptica infections in guinea pigs include an autogenous bacterin vaccine as well as three commercially available vaccines for Bordetella spp. (porcine B. bronchiseptica and human B. pertussis), which were found to offer some protection against the development of bronchopneumonia in experimentally infected guinea pigs.25\n",

The administration of premedications will also decrease the stress of induction. Isoflurane and sevoflurane are both acceptable inhalant anesthetics for guinea pigs. The advantage of sevoflurane is that it does not appear to have as noxious a scent as isoflurane, thereby reducing breath holding during induction and producing a smoother anesthetic episode. After induction, the inhalant anesthetic may be switched to isoflurane if cost is an issue. Guinea pigs should not be fasted more than 2 to 3 hours before anesthesia.

The endotracheal tube is then inserted into the caudal oropharynx. The anesthetist will then listen through the ear pieces of the stethoscope for expiration. The tube is then gently introduced into the trachea. This technique requires practice to perfect but, once the procedure has been performed several times, is a reliable way to intubate guinea pigs. Application of a small amount of lidocaine to the rima glottis can ease intubation. Rigid endoscopes and otoscopes, when available, are also very helpful in visualizing the glottis for intubation.",

In general, the surgical approach and technique are similar to those used with domestic species. The patient is placed in dorsal recumbency, and a ventral midline incision is made through the linea alba. Care must be taken upon entering the abdomen to avoid incising the large cecum, which is often situated along the ventral body wall. The body of the uterus can be located dorsal to the bladder. The ovaries lie caudally and laterally to the kidneys and are 6 to 8 mm in length.49 The abdomen of the guinea pig is deep, and the ovaries can be difficult to exteriorize. Care must be taken to avoid tearing the short ovarian vessels. Once the ovaries are removed, the uterus is ligated and transected in a manner similar to that used with other mammals.",
