A side window which joined an adjacent building full of bulling heifers, accounted for most of the rest of the inlet space. A rough on-farm calculation using 0.08 m 2 as the required inlet area for animals weighing 60-200 kg gave a total requirement of 12 x 0.08 = 0.96 m 2 . Therefore, inlet although poorly controlled was sufficient, but there was no outlet. Insufficient outlet is the main reason for poor ventilation in the majority of livestock accommodation (Kelly, 2002) . Any building without an exhaust in the roof will not function simply by stack effect and openings in the sidewalls will be required to operate as both inlets and outlets. The active inlet area is therefore reduced in such a situation. The roof space will have the potential to accumulate heat and moisture, leading to condensation and an ideal environment for promoting the potential survival of microorganisms (Robertson, 2000) .",

The video includes amazingly detailed footage of the key aspects of the life of the liver fluke from the laying of eggs in the bile ducts of cattle livers, through its development in faeces, seeking out a mud snail, and then its growth inside the animal.Merial Animal Health's Veterinary Adviser Fiona MacGillivray says: \"At previous events the 'flukey livers' we have displayed have always been a talking point because many farmers have never had a close-up view of fluke. Merial has invested in producing some stunning video and still images, and I know many vets and farmers will be fascinated by events such as egglaying, the miracidia searching for a mud snail host, cercaria moving onto the meadow grass, and the juvenile fluke as it moves towards the bile ducts.\"I am sure that seeing this video will bring home the threat that liver fluke poses for many farmers.Unfortunately it is a growing problem with more than one in five of all cattle that go for slaughter in Britain suffering from infection. 1 These tiny creatures could be costing farmers up to \u00a314m every year 2 .\" ",
