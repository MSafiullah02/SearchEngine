Other European countries reacted \u2018too little, too late\u2019, underestimating the coronavirus pandemic risk and enacting swift measures to protect the population [13]. In any case, all decisions were taken too late when the virus was already widely extended into the population [14]. In addition, some recommendations of supranational organizations (e.g. WHO and FIGO) were probably not followed [15,16]. Despite this, strategies for pandemic management should be based on the scientific rigor of professional organizations, real-time information from scientific journals, and instant online communication with worldwide coverage [17\u201319]. The magnitude of this global crisis resembles that of other pests, such as the Black Death occurring centuries ago, or the more recent H1N1/09 pandemic viral infection. It is expected that these pandemics will occur more frequently in the near future.",
