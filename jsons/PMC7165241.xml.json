Compared with propensity-matched patients who were electively listed, there was no significant difference in death at 1 month after LTx, ECMO use, or intensive care unit stay. The survival at 1 month and 5-year survival of urgently listed patients were comparable to that reported in the literature. Older age, liver impairment, and outside hospital transfer were associated with death after urgent listing. What is not known was their decision process: who to urgently list and who to bridge? Further investigation into frailty, sarcopenia, and other organ system dysfunction may improve patient selection.",

Matching is based on medical urgency (using principles similar to LAS) and waiting times5; patients with ECMO are prioritized. Owing to delayed referral and inadequate medical insurance coverage for LTx, Chinese patients frequently present to transplantation centers in critical condition.6 An analysis of the Chinese national database showed that 52.9% of patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV, 4.9% had ECMO bridging to transplantation, and 5.5% received mechanical ventilation. Decreased survival was associated with older age, NYHA Class IV, ECMO use, and renal insufficiency.7 Unlike in the West, in China the number of available clinically suitable donor lungs exceeds the number of patients referred for LTx7; therefore, urgent and critical cases are often assessed, and patients with pneumonia-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including post\u2013COVID-19 ARDS, have undergone LTx. Continued scrutiny and follow-up are needed to ensure just and appropriate transplantation in urgent cases. Unique to China, logistical bottlenecks result from the uneven distribution of Chinese LTx centers over vast geographical areas and jeopardize timely organ procurement. The \u201cGreen Channel of Human Organ Transportation\u201d is a national policy that ensures priority for flight departures and seamless connections to minimize ischemic times.6\n",
