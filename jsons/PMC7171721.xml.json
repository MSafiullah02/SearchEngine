The viral genome consists of the genome-linked protein VPg at the 5\u2032 end, a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame coding for a polyprotein, a 3\u2032-UTR, and a poly (A) tail. The polyprotein is first cleaved into three parts: P1, P2, and P3 by its proteases 2A and 3C. P1 is cleaved into four viral capsid proteins VP1 to VP4, and P2 and P3 are cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins involved in protein processing and genome replication, including 2A-2C and 3A-3D25 (Fig. 1).",

Alignment analysis of all available complete sequences shows the occurrence of three distinct deletions in the viral genome among the circulating EV-D68 strains. Compared with the prototype Fermon strain, all circulating strains have a 23 nt deletion at position 681 to 703 in the 5\u2032-UTR. The strains of lineage 1 have an additional 11 nt deletion at position 705 to 726 in the 5\u2032-UTR, while strains of lineage 2 have an additional 3 nt deletion at position 2,806 to 2,808 in VP1 (Fig. 3A, B). These deletions were reported by Tokarz et al (as clade C and A)10 and Imamura and Oshitani (as lineages 1 and 3).31 One strain (CA/AFP/11\u20131767, GenBank accession number KM892501), which belongs to lineage 1, has neither the second deletion in the 5\u2032-UTR nor the deletion in VP1, and is considered to be the intermediate in EV-D68 evolution (Fig. 3C).",

            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are pivotal to protecting the host against EV-D68 infection. Smura et al assessed NAbs against the Fermon strain in the Finnish population.34 They found that although Finnish people had high seroprevalence, the mean antibody levels against EV-68 showed a decreasing temporal trend from 1983 to 2002. As a rarely reported virus, children are less likely to build up specific immunity.12 The low levels of NAbs and limited cross-reactivity against the antisera of the circulating EV-D68 strains might be reasons for EV-D68 outbreaks in recent years.62 More studies are needed to comprehensively understand the pathogenesis of EV-D68.",

For example, it is not known how EV-D68 causes other system symptoms such as neurological illness, as EV-D68 has not been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients.57 It is also unclear how immune responses are induced at the site of infection. An animal model has not been developed. Therefore, more studies are needed to comprehensively understand the pathogenesis of EV-D68.",
