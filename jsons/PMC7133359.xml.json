            "text": "Although medical wastes represent a relatively small portion of the total waste generated in a community, medical waste management is considered an important issue worldwide. In Taiwan, the total amount of medical waste was estimated to increase from 61,343 Tons in 2002 to 117,544 Tons in 2004, including 10,943 and 22,326 Tons of hazardous waste, respectively (TEPA, 2004, TEPA, 2006). There are proven techniques for the medical industry to provide safe and proper medical waste treatment (Malkan and Nelson, 2005, Diaz et al., 2005). The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has called for the authorities to take more serious steps in managing medical waste. During that period, most of the waste produced from urgent and intensive medical care was classified as infectious. The procedures for handling, treatment and disposal of this waste were required to comply with the most stringent standards (Chiang et al., 2006). The health authority in Taiwan was alerted to re-examine the current status of waste production for further management planning. The types of medical establishments and the waste management capacity at hospitals have been recognized as important factors in waste treatment. Studies have reported that the quantity of waste generated by hospitals varied by changes in local legislation (Askarian et al., 2004, Fisher, 2005, Mohee, 2005, Bdour et al., 2007). Studies have also discussed the opportunities for waste reduction through better management practices for both infectious and general wastes (Almuneef and Memish, 2003, Tudor et al., 2005). For better knowledge of medical waste generation and management, we conducted a survey to investigate the types and quantities of medical waste generated from healthcare related establishments in Taiwan. The quantities of medical waste produced were evaluated using selected factors.",

Using a conditional comprehensive contract system, any qualified medical establishment may apply to become a contracted care institution to provide services to beneficiaries. The medical establishment applies to the Bureau of NHI for services reimbursement by the official fee schedule. As of the end of 2003, over 96% of the population was enrolled in the NHI program. The Department of Health in Taiwan has categorized approximately 18,700 medical establishments into four levels: medical centers, regional hospitals, local (community) hospitals, and independent clinics and others (including dental clinics, psychiatric treatment facilities, institutions for training and special functions, long-term care centers, postnatal care centers, and care centers for the elderly) (BNHI, 2004).",

Types and quantities of waste generated from medical establishments may vary with the medical specialties and their waste management practices (Pr\u00fcss et al., 1999, UNEP, 2002). Data analysis measured the potential factors associated with the amount of waste production, such as the capacity of services and the medical specialties provided by the medical establishment. It has been statistically justified that the type of medical establishment affects the production of infectious and general waste. Multiple variable regression analysis was applied to predict the factors associated with waste generation. The amount of infectious waste and the number of inpatients can be associated with the total number of beds and bed occupancy. Reimbursement from the NHI to individual medical establishments could be an interesting indicator reflecting the capacity of services provided. Therefore, factors including NHI payment, total number of beds, rate of bed occupancy, number of beds for infectious diseases, number of outpatients per day and amount of waste recycled (in Tons) were included in the multivariate model to examine their association with waste production.",

In Taiwan, the larger hospitals care for more inpatients and outpatients, and thus receive a greater amount of NHI reimbursement. The larger hospital has greater capacity to provide infectious disease care and more effective waste management. Therefore, NHI payment and total number of beds were significant variables in predicting the amount of infectious wastes. Although, this may not be a direct association, the increase of every 0.1 billion NT dollars in NHI reimbursement reflected an increase of 8 Tons of annual infectious waste generation (p\n < 0.0001). On the other hand, NHI payment was not a significant factor to predict the general waste production rate (p\n = 0.22). We also found that the generation of infectious waste could be reduced by 0.13 Tons for the increase of every unit (one bed) of total number of beds.",

In regional hospitals, dialysis, the analytical laboratory, ICU, the pathological laboratory, and internal medicine were major sources of infectious wastes. However, surgery remains the unit with the highest production rate per day per bed. To our knowledge, the prevalence of end stage renal disease requiring diagnosis in Taiwan is rather high (BNHI, 2004). In comparison, regional hospitals have become important establishments to provide patients with dialysis services. Dialysis is a medical specialty using a large amount of disposable materials in the care process, which rapidly increases the amount of waste (Shaprio et al., 2003).",

There should be a balance between waste reduction and public threat of medical wastes (Blenkharn, 2006). Our study showed that the ratios of infectious wastes to total wastes were high in Taiwan. We are not sure there was a residual effect of up-regulation of waste management during the SARS chaos. We noted that there was a great increase in infectious waste in most medical establishments because of reduced recycling practice and the irrational reaction of society during the SARS epidemic. The increased infectious wastes were associated with eliminated segregation and segregation errors in line with precautions. Medical establishments should enhance the practice of waste segregation, sorting, and resource recycling and recovery.",
