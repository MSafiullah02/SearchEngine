The subsequent cycles of chemotherapy were held. On hospital day 21, he developed fever and productive cough with new infiltrate on chest radiograph ( Figure 1 ) and was treated as healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The histopathological findings in the lung consisted of haemorrhagic necrotising pneumonia and exudative DAD with heterogeneous severity. These changes are similar to those described in animal model by de Wit et al. 8 and recently in humans by Ng et al. 7 An interesting morphological finding was the presence of CD4 + lymphocytic intimal arteritis, indicating an active immune response to injurious stimulus. This vascular injury was focal and not associated with intimal fibrinoid necrosis or thrombus formation. Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4)/CD26 is a recently described receptor, by which MERS-CoV enters target cells, and expressed in several types of cells including pneumocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells. 6, 9 Pulmonary microvascular thrombosis was described in lethal MERS-CoV in mice transgenic to human DPP4. 10 The presence of more aggressive vascular insult and thrombotic event, probably contributing to the necrotising nature of lung disease, could not be excluded in our case. It is worth mentioning that during the clinical course, the patient had bacterial pneumonia which might have contributed to the pulmonary pathological findings at the time of post-mortem examination. Another intriguing finding in examined lung tissue was the ultrastructural localisation of the VP not only in the pneumocytes, as described previously, 7 but also in the alveolar macrophages. In ex-vivo models, the kidney epithelial cells were highly permissive for MERS-CoV replication and produced almost 1000-fold more infectious MERS-CoV progeny than bronchial epithelial cells. 6 In humans, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in urine samples. 11 Early and rapid-onset ARF is encountered commonly in patients with MERS-CoV infection, affecting the outcome of the disease negatively. 5, 6, 11, 12 Recently, Yeung et al. 13 demonstrated disseminated MERS-CoV infection to the kidneys and other organs in an infected animal model. The presence of AKI in our patient is consistent with the recently published data on renal biopsy from a patient with MERS-CoV infection. 14 This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the presence of VP in renal PTEC. This finding supports the viral kidney trophism as a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of ARF in MERS-CoV infection.
