The man (named \u04e6tzi the Iceman), who lived 5300 years ago, carried two fragments of a fruiting body of Fomitopsis betulina (formerly Piptoporus betulinus). Some scientists believe that \u04e6tzi might have used the fungus for medical purposes (Capasso 1998) and, although the idea arouses some controversy (P\u00f6der 2005), the long tradition of the use of F. betulina in folk medicine is a fact (Reshetnikov et al. 2001; Wasser 2010). Infusion from F. betulina fruiting bodies was popular, especially in Russia, Baltic countries, Hungary, Romania for its nutritional and calming properties. Fungal tea was used against various cancer types, as an immunoenhancing, anti-parasitic agent, and a remedy for gastrointestinal disorders (Grienke et al. 2014; Lucas 1960; Peintner and P\u00f6der 2000; Semerd\u017eieva and Veselsk\u00fd 1986; Shamtsyan et al. 2004). Antiseptic and anti-bleeding dressings made from fresh F. betulina fruiting body were applied to wounds and the powder obtained from dried ones was used as a painkiller (Grienke et al. 2014; Papp et al. 2015; Rutalek 2002).",

Homobasidiomycetes were divided into eight clades. The family Polyporaceae with the genus Piptoporus was classified to the polyporoid clade, and then the antrodia clade\u2014the Fomitopsis-Daedalea-Piptoporus group comprising brown rot fungi was identified within this clade (Hibbett and Donoghue 2001; Hibbett and Thorn 2001). Further studies of the phylogenetic relationships among members of the antrodia clade revealed polyphyly of the Fomitopsis genus and suggested that P. betulinus was phylogenetically closer to Fomitopsis than to Piptoporus (Kim et al. 2005; Ortiz-Santana et al. 2013). Recently, P. betulinus (Bull.) P. Karst. has been transferred to Fomitopsis (Han et al. 2016) and, according to Index Fungorum (2016), is classified in the genus Fomitopsis, family Fomitopsidaceae, order Polyporales, class Agaricomycetes, division Basidiomycota, kingdom Fungi, with the current name Fomitopsis betulina (Bull.)

The mycelium of F. betulina developing on agar media is white, relatively homogeneous, downy-felt, with regular colony edges (Fig. 1b). The hyphae develop radially. The hyphal system is mostly dimitic. The clamped generative hyphae, 1.5\u20133.5 \u00b5m in diameter, are branched and hyaline whereas the skeletal hyphae with the diameter of 3\u2013 4 \u00b5m, are less branched and have thicker walls. No primordia or fruiting bodies of this species were found in vitro (Petre and Tanase 2013). Basidiospores are smooth, hyaline, thin-walled, and cylindrical (Han and Cui 2015; Han et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2005; Schwarze 1993).",

Brown rot fungi extensively degrade the carbohydrate fraction of lignocellulose but, in contrast to white rot fungi, leave lignin, although in a modified form. In these fungi, chemical depolymerization of cellulose, which precedes and supports its enzymatic degradation, is very important. They lack ligninolytic peroxidases and usually some other enzymes such as processive cellobiohydrolases used for degradation of crystalline cellulose, but contain H2O2-generating oxidases and Fe3+- and quinone-reducing enzymes used for non-enzymatic depolymerization of polysaccharides (Arantes and Goodell 2014; Baldrian and Val\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 2008; Hori et al. 2013).

            "text": "\nFomitopsis betulina is one of the most common brown rot species but its wood-decaying mechanism has been tested only fragmentarily (Meng et al. 2012) and is still poorly understood. As other fungi of this type, it degrades wood to yield brown, cubical cracks easily broken down. Many factors, including microflora or compounds present in wood, contribute to this complex process (Przyby\u0142 and \u017b\u0142obi\u0144ska-Podejma 2000; Song et al. 2016; Zarzy\u0144ski 2009). Shang et al. (2013) showed that wood samples decayed by F. betulina lost 57% of dry weight (dw) and 74% of holocellulose after 30 days, whereas the fungus growing on wheat straw causes 65% loss of dw within 98 days of culture (Val\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 and Baldrian 2006a). A set of enzymes of F. betulina involved in the degradation of lignocellulose was characterized in detail by Val\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 and Baldrian (2006a, b). The fungus growing on straw produced enzymes with wide substrate specificities: (1\u21924)-\u03b2-endoglucanase, \u03b2-glucosidase, (1\u21924)-\u03b2-endoxylanase, (1\u21924)-\u03b2-endomannanase, (1\u21924)-\u03b2-xylosidase, and (1\u21924)-\u03b2-mannosidase. The activities of ligninolytic enzymes and cellobiose dehydrogenase for oxidoreductive cleavage of cellulose were not detected. Similar results were obtained in liquid cultures by V\u0115trovsk\u00fd et al. (2013). When F. betulina grew in nature, \u03b2-glucosidase and \u03b2-mannosidase activity was associated with the fruiting bodies while endopolysaccharidases were detected in colonized wood (Val\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 and Baldrian 2006a).",

Logs with a diameter of 8\u201318 cm and length of 107\u2013135 cm were inoculated and then cultured in natural conditions. The yield obtained was in the range from 212 to 1298 g fresh weight (1\u20132 mushrooms per log). Development of fruiting bodies took an average of 18 months. The ratio of log yield was estimated at 2.8\u20136.1%. The only report on indoor production of F. betulina fruiting bodies was given by Pleszczy\u0144ska et al. (2016). In the study, four strains of F. betulina isolated from natural habitats were applied. Their mycelia were inoculated into birch sawdust supplemented with organic additives. Mature fruiting bodies weighing from 50 to 120 g were obtained from only one strain, after 3\u20134 months of the cultivation in artificial conditions (Fig. 1c). The biological efficiency ranged from 12 to 16%. It was shown that extracts isolated from cultivated and naturally grown F. betulina fruiting bodies had comparable biological activity (Table 1).",

The overview of the available literature concerning medical potential of birch polypore was presented in Table 1. Referring to the folk uses of the birch polypore, most of the presented research was based on crude extracts, which often have greater bioactivity than isolated constituents at an equivalent dose. This phenomenon is explained by mostly synergistic interactions between compounds present in mixtures. Furthermore, extracts often contain substances that inhibit multi-drug resistance and therefore further increase the effectiveness of the active substances. Particularly noteworthy among the wide variety of biological activities of F. betulina extract, are properties proved in in vivo studies, e.g. the efficacy of water and ethanol extracts in treatment of the genital tract in dogs (Utzig and Samborski 1957; Wandokanty et al. 1954, 1955) or mice protection from lethal infection with the TBE virus by water, ethanol, and ether extracts (Kandefer-Szersze\u0144 et al. 1981; Kandefer-Szersze\u0144 and Kawecki 1974, 1979). The broad spectrum of antiviral and antimicrobial activity of F. betulina extracts proved by a number of research teams in different models based on different techniques deserves special attention as well (see references cited in Table 1). Recently, Stamets (2011, 2014) has invented formulations prepared from different medicinal mushrooms including F. betulina, which are useful in preventing and treating viral and bacterial diseases, i.e. herpes, influenza, SARS, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and infections with E. coli and S. aureus .",

The new compound showed anti-gram-positive bacteria activity. The medicinal activity of some triterpenoids tested was examined more accurately. It was shown that polyporenic acid C, just like another compound isolated from F. betulina, i.e. (E)-2-(4-hydroxy-3methyl-2-butenyl)-hydroquinone, had inhibitory activity against some matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), with IC50 values (concentration causing inhibition by 50% compared to control) in the range from 23 to 128 \u00b5M (Kawagishi et al. 2002). Polyporenic acid C and three other F. betulina triterpenoids (Table 1) showed anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity by strong inhibition of 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and bacterial hyaluronate lyase activity, respectively (Wangun et al. 2004).",

(1\u21923)-\u03b1-d-glucans whose main chain contains 84.6% of (1\u21923)-linked \u03b1-d-glucopyranose in addition to 6% of (1\u21924)-linked units were purified and characterized by Wiater et al. (2011). Another polysaccharide, named piptoporane I, was extracted and purified by Olennikov et al. (2012). This \u03b1-glucan was built from residues of (1\u21923)-\u03b1-d-glucopyranose with occasional branching by single residues of \u03b2-d-glucopyranose at the C6 position (17.3%). It has been shown that fungal (1\u21923)-\u03b1-d-glucans, including that from F. betulina, effectively induce the production of microbial (1\u21923)-\u03b1-glucanases (mutanases), i.e. enzymes that have potential in dental caries prevention. (1\u21923),(1\u21926)-\u03b1-d-Glucans (mutans) synthesized by mutans streptococci are key structural and functional constituents of dental plaque matrix; therefore, they seem to be a good target for enzymatic anti-caries strategy (Pleszczy\u0144ska et al. 2015). However, streptococcal glucans are difficult to use as inducers of mutanases because of the low yield and structural variation. Birch polypore \u03b1-glucan, whose amount in the cell wall of F. betulina reaches even 44\u201353% dw (Gr\u00fcn 2003), can be used to replace streptococcal glucans (Wiater et al. 2008).",

            "text": "The F. betulina fungus has been widely used and appreciated in folk medicine, and modern pharmacological studies have confirmed its potential indicating significant antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. The possibility of successful cultivation thereof in artificial conditions additionally promotes the applicability of the fungus. However, compared with other polypore fungi, the research on F. betulina is less developed; for instance, little is known about its lifestyle, including the wood degradation strategy. Moreover, most of the bioactivity studies have been performed using crude extracts; hence, only a few of the effects have been associated with the active substances identified, e.g. antibacterial activities with piptamine or polyporenic acids. With a few exceptions, we still do not know the mechanisms underlying the biological activities. Verification of biological activities in in vivo and clinical studies is also required. The further research could contribute to better exploitation of the F. betulina application potential.",
