These data provide a wealth of detailed information that can yield significant insight into macromolecular function. To use this information most effectively, visualization tools were developed and are increasingly becoming everyday tools for biologists. For example, many biochemists regularly view protein structures to gain insight into protein function (Fig. 1). Chemists look at ligand-binding sites as part of drug design. Molecular biologists view RNA structures and complexes with proteins to gain insight into RNA signal and message processing. Some aspects of structure visualization remain mostly the domain of the specialist, such as molecular motion and large-scale molecular assemblies. Even in these intrinsically more complex fields, however, resources are beginning to enable bench biologists to visualize and use this information.",

Most of these tools have a large set of features in common, including standard representations (ribbon, space-filling, ball-and-stick and so on) and coloring schemes (element-based coloring of atoms, coloring by secondary structure and so on). It is beyond the scope of this review to comprehensively compare all of these tools; instead, we focus on key biological questions for which visualizing structures can provide insight, and we highlight practical methods and tools with outstanding features that are particularly suited to addressing these questions.",

Visualizing large, complex and multi-scale macromolecular assemblies, especially combined with molecular motion, is not only challenging computationally, but ultimately may require display systems significantly better than current computer monitors can provide. Immersive virtual reality is very promising, enabling the user to virtually enter a microscopic world, flying through and interactively manipulating macromolecules. Experimental immersive environments\u2014for example, CAVE86\u2014have been in development for over 20 years, and concepts from this research have been used to enhance the user experience of several molecular graphics tools (for example, Yasara; Table 1). But such techniques have yet to find widespread use for molecular visualization\u2014partially because of the still high cost and cumbersome nature of such systems, but perhaps also because the sense of immersion is not critical for interaction with the molecular world.",

These improvements are largely driven by the gaming market and are expected to continue rapidly. For most molecular graphics tools, minimal modifications should be required to allow them to work with such hardware, and some tools have been built with such support already in mind (for example, VMD26 and SRS 3D7).

Although physical wooden and wire molecular models played a critical early role in structural chemistry and biology, the advent of three-dimensional interactive computer graphics in the 1970's provided new and much improved utility in macromolecular structure determination and analysis. However, a more recent technology, computer autofabrication, or 'solid printing', initially developed for industrial rapid prototyping, is now being used to produce physical molecular models. Such models bring back the properties of real-object perception and manipulation that were lost when the model resided only in the computer. Over the past decade, the variety of such printers has increased steadily as the entry price has dropped to below $10,000 and printing services have sprouted to fill this new niche. Because accurate and complex tangible models can be produced automatically as computer 'printouts' of molecular geometrical representations, the barrier to custom production has disappeared. Physical models with functional parts have been autofabricated with analog physical constraints, affinities and/or structural behavior of the molecular system87 (Fig. 8).",
