However, a local survey found that there are difficulties in fully adopting social distancing and in some cases, delays in diagnosis have increased the risk of community spread [7]. Memories of SARS from 2003 are still very fresh for many Hong Kong people and there has been great concern about the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak. Surgical masks have been in very short supply, and for a time there was panic buying of rice, toilet paper and other basic goods despite there being no overall shortages throughout the city [8].",

The switch to \u2018working from home\u2019 and \u2018schooling from home\u2019 in very small apartments has led to additional new pressures for a population which is much more familiar with daily commuting. Social distancing is good for infectious disease control, but social isolation can worsen mental health [11] and anxiety levels are reported to be borderline abnormal [7]. Finally, like all developed and highly connected places, Hong Kong\u2019s social media has been a mixed blessing to parents struggling to keep their children\u2019s education on track [12].",
