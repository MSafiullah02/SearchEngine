Neonates, immuno-compromised patients, patients with cancer or myelo-dysplastic syndromes, and pregnant women are at particular risk of developing HSV hepatitis, which may be caused by HSV type 1 and 2 [15, 30]. HSV hepatitis in immunocompetent persons, however, has also been reported [9, 12].",

The viruses may be demonstrated by electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and by DNA-in situ hybridisation. However, the light microscopic appearance is so characteristic that these sophisticated techniques are not required to diagnose HSV hepatitis. Hepatitis is a rare complication of HSV infection, but when it occurs it usually presents as a fulminant disease with a high mortality rate of up to approximately 80% [15, 21].",
