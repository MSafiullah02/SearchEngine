The portable chest radiograph is the most commonly requested imaging examination in ICU, and, despite its limitations, it significantly contributes to the decision-making process. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is reserved for relatively complex and challenging clinical scenarios. Bedside ultrasound is emerging as a promising imaging modality as it does not subject the patients to risks and resources involved in the transportation of these patients to the CT facility. Ultrasound is an effective modality to triage patients and is being increasingly incorporated into the emergency and intensive care management algorithms.",

Besides renal and liver failure, overzealous hydration in settings of trauma and immediate postoperative care frequently contibutes to fluid overload. There are two distinct radiological phases of the pressure edema\u2014the interstitial edema and the alveolar edema. The radiographic findings in the early interstitial phase include indistinctness of the intrapulmonary vasculature, peribronchial cuffing, and Kerley lines. Indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature is subtle but often the most useful radiographic sign of early interstitial edema in ICU patients. With increasing intensity and duration of pressure gradient, edema extends into the alveolar spaces, resulting in nodular or acinar areas of increased opacity that coalesce into frank consolidation (Fig. 7.2). There is a good correlation between the increased pressure in the intravascular compartment as measured by the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and radiographic appearances (Table 7.1) [4].\n\n",

It can provide a reasonable estimate of intravascular volume status. Increased width of vascular pedicle (>7 cm) thus may help in differentiating hydrostatic pulmonary edema from non-cardiogenic edema (Fig. 7.3). The CT findings of hydrostatic pulmonary edema include smooth interlobular septal thickening, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and pleural effusions (Fig. 7.4). The distribution of densities often demonstrates gravity-based gradient, with abnormalities being most notable at the lung bases. Atypical distribution or appearances similar to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia may be seen in presence of underlying chronic pulmonary disease, such as emphysema [5].\n\n",

In ICU settings, the common primary pulmonary pathologies causing ARDS are pneumonia, aspiration, and pulmonary contusions. The common extrathoracic causes include drug toxicity, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, shock, and abdominal trauma [5]. Clinically, ARDS is defined by recently created \u201cBerlin definition\u201d (Table 7.2) [6]. ARDS involves three often overlapping and conflicting stages. The first or exudative stage is characterized by a rapidly progressing high protein content interstitial edema that quickly fills the alveoli and is associated with hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation. The second or proliferative stage involves organization of the fibrinous exudate, regeneration of the alveolar lining, and thickening of the alveolar septa. The third or fibrotic stage manifests as varying degrees of scarring and formation of subpleural and intrapulmonary cysts.\n",

The typical CT findings in this phase are dense consolidation in posterior dependent portions of the lung with ground-glass opacities in nondependent areas (Fig. 7.7). This gravitational distribution can be changed by patient\u2019s position (supine vs prone), suggesting a significant contribution from atelectasis [3].

Obstructive atelectasis from impaired mucociliary clearance, increased secretions, and altered consciousness is often encountered in the ICU patients. Distal obstruction manifests as crowding of air bronchograms, whereas the proximal mucus plugging leads to lobar or even complete lung collapse (Fig. 7.8).

However, there are certain features that may favor pneumonia (Table 7.4). Air bronchograms typically associated with pneumonia result from the complete filling of the alveolar spaces around nonobstructed bronchi.

In the supine position, the frequently involved sites are the posterior segments of the upper lobes and superior segment of the lower lobe [12]. The radiographic abnormalities commonly seen with aspiration are patchy ill-defined ground-glass opacities, nodular opacities, or consolidation in the dependent regions of the lungs (Fig. 7.10). The opacities usually are seen over the first 1\u20132 days in aspiration pneumonitis demonstrating relatively rapid resolution on follow up radiographs. Persisting opacities indicate progression to infectious pneumonia, and this is one important reason for following up the patients on radiographs. The CT better demonstrates the ground-glass changes or consolidation. Areas of necrosis and cavitation can be seen when aspirates contain anaerobic organisms [12]. Tree-in-bud opacities present in the abovementioned dependent distribution are also frequently seen with aspiration [8].\n",

On the CXR, the position of the valve corresponds to the inner aspect of the anterior first rib [35]. A catheter is more likely to get blocked from thrombosis around it when its position is in proximal SVC or at the thoracic inlet than in the distal SVC or at the cavoatrial junction [37]. The inferior border of bronchus intermedius serves as a good guide to the distal SVC (Fig. 7.21). On the CXR, the cavoatrial junction corresponds to the lower border of the bronchus intermedius, while the arch of azygos is located at the right tracheobronchial angle (superior aspect of the origin of the right bronchus from the carina). Tip of any catheter near the right tracheobronchial angle can slip into azygos vein and result in complications. Azygos location of a catheter tip can be identified by its characteristic orientation and position (Fig. 7.21c). Too caudal a position in right atrium increases the risk of dysrhythmia for small caliber peripherally inserted central lines (PICC) and central venous catheters. The right atrial positioning, however, is desirable for large-caliber dialysis catheters. PICC lines may coil in the veins of the upper extremity, turn cranially into the internal jugular vein, cross to the contralateral brachiocephalic vein, or enter the azygos vein.\n",
