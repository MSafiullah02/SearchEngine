Hence, in all these instances, time is the basic element for a fitness network model.11,12 However, another basic element, the principle of preferential attachment\u2014leading to the scale-free degree distribution\u2014is increasingly controversial13,14 as an omnipresent model of complex systems. In one recent study, it was shown that the scale-free network is rare.13 In this report, we argue that time evolution is the key for any network model, but the birth time of a node should not entirely preordain its final state. While the first mover advantage is an advantage, it is not sufficient to guarantee final success\u2014sometimes better ideas will appear later. In particular, the degree distribution of growing engineering networks is usually influenced by both geography and resource-driven demand; hence, links cannot be predicted well via an algorithm that is based solely on the principle of pure preferential attachment.15,16",

First, we construct a fully connected network, and every node is one initial community. Second, we evaluate the probability that generates a new community or choose a community by the same probability mass function.

All in all, our model can construct a regular or tree-like network with clear and predictable communities and controllable degree distributions.

Hence, the label i of the new community is c+1, where c is the number of old communities. Otherwise, introduce a new node as a member of an old community. The community to be chosen is decided by its label number i; the bigger i means the later birth. In other words, the probability that a particular community is chosen is determined by its age, inversely proportional to Pinverse. The later born community is easy to be chosen with the bigger \u03b2 then forming more communities.(4)Next, the new node has a probability p to connect its own community nodes and 1\u2212p to randomly connect to other community nodes. Here, p can be 1; due to the community, the first node has connected the node from other communities at step 2. If the number of nodes within a community is not enough to be connected by its new node, let the new node first connect all nodes within the community randomly and then connect the external nodes randomly.(5)Repeat (2), (3), and (4) n\u2032 times and then the number of nodes is n=k+n\u2032.\nTime is the key power in the BA model, the birth time determines the popularity of nodes, and the popularity of a node determines accretion of links. Hence, the richer get richer and the link resource distribution becomes more unequal. However, our model introduces the control parameter \u03b2 to create new communities to get the resource and also controls both new and old communities to share the resource, in contrast to a mechanism in which high degree nodes absorb more links over time.",

However, a small number of nodes will struggle to make an impact on the community structure\u2014or be strongly wired with their intended community. To accelerate the computation, we can delete these nodes and then add new nodes. Actually, in a real-world growing network, that some nodes only connect other communities is natural. Such as in the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network,25 the haplotype h35 (group A) only connects other group B due to the relationship between them, and its community is uncovered.

In this report, we adopt the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary data25 as a real-world network, a node stands for one kind of a haplotype or a medium vector, and a link stands for an evolutionary relationship between two connected nodes. The SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network with 5 groups (communities) has 59 nodes (58 haplotypes and one medium vector mv2) and 59 links before 4 February 2020. Here, in the SARS-Cov-2 network, we observe that the root node in each community is the hub node with the highest degrees; hence, we set that a new node connects the oldest node within the same community with a 90% probability. As depicted in Fig. 6, when we set \u03b2=min(ni) to avoid a large number of communities, n=59. Our model can construct a network that has the same number of communities, the lowest degree, and the maximum depth of the tree within a community as the real evolutionary network. Furthermore, as shown in Table II, our model network33 has the similar modularity value, the predictability value, and the highest degree as that of the real network. Results show that our model can fit well with the real-world evolving network that has new communities. In addition, we can also see that the Barabasi\u2013Albert (BA)11 network cannot grow communities [Fig. 6(c)], and the highest degree value (18) is far less than that of the real network (30). Hence, we suggest that the BA model cannot fit with the real-world evolving network that has new communities.",

The karate club network is the common used data and has been widely applied for community detection.17 Moreover, we adopt the foundational community detection algorithm, the Girvan\u2013Newman (GN) algorithm,17 to detect the karate club network. As depicted in Fig. 7, when we set \u03b2=min(ni) to avoid a large number of communities, k=3, m=2, and n=34. Our model can construct a network that has the same number of communities and the size of the biggest community as the real karate club network. Surprising, our model and the real network each have a community with only one node. Furthermore, as shown in Table III, our model network has a similar modularity value, a predictability value, and the lowest degree as that of the real network. Results show that our model can also fit with the traditional network, which has been widely used for community detection.",
