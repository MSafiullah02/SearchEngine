The current diagnostic microbial standard detects S. pneumoniae in less than 30% of CAP cases. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting autolysin (lytA) is able to increase the rate of detection. The aim of this study is validation of this quantitative PCR in vitro using different available strains and in vivo using clinical samples (oropharyngeal swabs). The PCR autolysin (lytA) was validated by testing the intra-and inter-run variability. Also, the in vitro specificity and sensitivity, including the lower limit of detection was determined. In addition, a pilot-study was performed using samples from patients (n = 28) with pneumococcal pneumonia and patients (n = 28) with a pneumonia without detection of S. pneumoniae with the current diagnostic microbial standard, but with detection of either a viral and or another bacterial pathogen to validate this test further. The intra-and inter-run variability were relatively low (SD's ranging from 0.08 to 0.96 cycle thresholds). The lower limit of detection turned out to be 1-10 DNA copies/reaction. In-vitro sensitivity and specificity of the tested specimens (8 strains carrying lytA and 6 strains negative for lytA) were both 100%. In patients with pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal pneumonia a cut-off value of 6.000 copies/mL would lead to a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 85.7%. We were able to develop a quantitative PCR targeting lytA with good in-vitro test characteristics.",

            "text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important pathogen causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1] [2] [3] . The current diagnostic standard, comprised of blood cultures, sputum cultures and the urinary antigen test (UAT), is only able to detect S. pneumoniae in less than 30% of CAP cases [4, 5] . Furthermore, it takes up to several days to yield a positive result and antibiotic therapy can be narrowed [6] . The UAT is currently the test with the highest sensitivity, ranging from 59 to 87% and specificity of 94%, increasing the detection of S. pneumoniae in patients with CAP from 14.0 to 27.0% [7] . Detecting S. pneumoniae before or after the start of antibiotic treatment requires a target. Different genes of S. pneumoniae have been used in research as a target, including spn9802, pneumolysin (ply), wzg (cpsA), and autolysin (lytA) by PCR [4, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . A target gene should be specific for S. pneumoniae and be absent in the other non-pneumococcal streptococci such as Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and the recently discovered Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae [18] . Remarkably, ply is believed to be less specific for S. pneumoniae than lytA [19, 20] . The ply and lytA gene have both been found in S. mitis strains. The isolates containing these genes were all associated with respiratory disease [21] . One recent study by Albrich et al. [5] showed that quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tested on nasopharyngeal (NP) samples targeting the lytA gene in a study population that consisted mainly of HIV-infected adults detected S. pneumoniae in 52.5% of CAP cases. The diagnostic standard (blood culture, sputum Gram stain or culture or UAT) detected S. pneumoniae in only 27.1% of CAP cases. The combination of target genes has been suggested to improve the reliability of the qPCR. The target gene piaB has been used next to lytA to increase the specificity. A recent study by Simoes et al. [22] used both lytA and piaB to identify S. pneumoniae and the addition of piaB led to the discovery of two pneumococcal strains that were not identified by lytA alone. However, the authors mention that piaB is not present in some non-encapsulated pneumococci and some non-typeable pneumococci. An earlier study also combined lytA and piaA for the detection of colonization of the nasopharynx by S. pneumoniae [23] . A strain was considered to be a S. pneumoniae species when both genes were present. Four strains did not include the piaA gene, but turned out to be S. pneumoniae species.",

LytA is a stable or conserved gene, which is a favorable target for detection [13] . In 2001 McAvin et al. [13] found that in vitro the lytA gene showed promising results with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for S. pneumoniae. A more recent study in which clinical samples were used also found a specificity of 100%, but a much lower sensitivity of 53% [26] . Other research stated that lytA is not specific enough to differentiate between S. pneumoniae and some strains of S. mitis, S. pseudopneumoniae and S. oralis [18, 27, 28] . However, there are studies that claim that lytA can rarely be found in non-pneumococcal bacteria [14, 15] .",

The largest study tested a total of 257 strains belonging to 37 different species including 30 S. mitis strains, with no false negative results and only one false positive result out of 30 S. mitis strains.

The six negative controls used in the present study are all six closely related to S. pneumoniae. Testing these non-pneumococcal strains makes for a valuable contribution to previous trials because they generate signals reported specific to S. pneumoniae, in terms of optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and Quellung testing, the classic methods used to identify pneumococci. These signals make it difficult to discriminate them from pneumococcal strains when performing these tests on blood cultures. However, our PCR was able to discriminate between these strains and S. pneumoniae. The small number of strains tested might overestimate the true specificity. The specificity could be improved by adding a piaB confirmation-PCR, which can be used for the samples tested positive for lytA.",

The very small number of samples is a clear limitation of our study. This pilot-study was conducted to perform a preliminary in vivo validation of the qPCR and was not designed as a full clinical trial. A larger population could have resulted in a proper cut-off value, which could be used in further studies or in clinical practice. Although the use of this limited number of OP samples was not intended to define a proper cut-off value, preliminary results are promising: best AUC of 0.714 with a sensitivity of 57.1% and specificity of 85.7% with a cutoff value of 6.000 copies/mL. The AUC was even higher when only using the samples of patients with a complete diagnostic workup; a sensitivity of 72.7% and a specificity of 84.6% using a cut-off value of 6.000 copies/mL (AUC 0.787). Choosing a different cut-off value to achieve the highest sensitivity may implicate a lower specificity. In clinical practice, in patients who are colonized with S. pneumoniae and infected with another bacterial pathogen, the test may be considered as (false) positive and consequently these patients would be treated with narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy.",

The cut-off value was set at a Ctvalue instead of the number of DNA copies/mL. The cut-off was set on a Ct-value of 35 [36] . The sensitivity of the lytA rt-PCR was significantly higher than blood culture, 17.1% versus 12.9%, but has a much lower sensitivity compared to the lytA qPCR we tested on OP swabs. The specificity of the rt-PCR on blood samples was 97.4%. The authors consider this a possible consequence of cross-reactivity with S. mitis among other bacteria. This limitation of the lytA PCR has been described in other research as well. One study tested 11 streptococcal isolates that showed conflicting or previously unknown patterns when using optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, lytA PCR and multilocus sequence analysis and discovered that three strains were misidentified with the lytA rt-PCR (one false-negative result and two S. pseudopneumoniae strains led to a false-positive result) [22] . In three patients without detection of S. pneumoniae The dotted line represents the cut-off value of 6.0000 DNA copies/ mL using the current diagnostic standard, but with detection of a virus (two coronaviruses and one influenza A virus) concentrations of S. pneumoniae above 40.000 copies/mL were detected, which limits the specificity of our test in this experiment. A possible explanation for these high concentrations of DNA copies/mL is false-negative results of the current pneumococcal tests. Only one of these patients was pretreated with antibiotics and they all had a favorable outcome with amoxicillin. Given the high DNA concentrations above the cut-off values for colonization and the favorable response to therapy an underlying pneumococcal infection seems very likely.",

When counting all positive results (every patient with a DNA copy number of more than zero) the sensitivity of the qPCR is 82% (23 out of 28 patients). Another possible explanation for the low sensitivity compared to the in-vitro sensitivity is the sample technique or sample site. Some studies use sputum samples which are difficult to obtain, whereas others use NP swabs instead of OP swabs [4, 5, 19] . One of these studies compared trans-nasal and transoral sampling, and concluded that the nasopharynx is the main reservoir for S. pneumoniae [23] , but data on the best sampling technique is limited and unclear about which technique is superior. According to the WHO Pneumococcal Carriage Working Group NP samples have a slightly higher sensitivity in detecting colonization with S. pneumoniae in healthy adults and children. A combination of NP and OP samples is recommended for detection of S. pneumoniae carriage in adults. There are no current recommendations about molecular diagnostics and detection of S. pneumoniae in patients with CAP [39, 40] . Recent research showed that in healthy adults and adults with influenza-like-symptoms the qPCR targeting lytA and piaA or piaB yielded more positive results than cultures (carriage in healthy adults 20% using the qPCR vs. 5% detection using cultures). The detection rate of S. pneumoniae in adults with influenza-like-illness was highest in saliva samples (28%) followed by OP swabs (11%), cultures (10%) and NP swabs (5%) [41, 42] .",

A standard curve was assessed for the quantitative assay by using the S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 strain. Standard curves (three standard curves, calculated with three different experiments, the average of these curves was used as a final standard curve) were validated using strains with known concentrations (OK-2-816; OK-2-1213; OK-2-1214; OK-2-077), kindly provided by the Department of Paediatric Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Wilhelmina's Children Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.
