It also helps in assessing impression of placement where prevention measures are being taken (e.g., prescription, recovery causes, or treatment location, etc.). Afterward, we have to deploy time-series visualization, animations, map series, linked micro maps, and timeliness of geographic forms to evaluate these changing patterns. Later, healthcare analysis and temporals are analytical studies that expose the missed prevention opportunities or mark location where various intrusions are proved effective. This data is beneficial to depict the necessary areas for more resources and controlled procedures.",

The approach described facilitates the comparison of algorithms for early detection within a spatially relevant context. It is envisaged that the software will be developed further to include more detailed consideration of modes of disease spread, and to incorporate case detection and disease control processes. The implementation of the GIS environment, although not the most efficient approach, provides significant advantages including access to a large number of spatial functions, and is suited to the rapid development and prototyping. However, this approach is useful to trace and treat the patients timely, as well to take preemptive measure in that particular area to stop spreading COVID-19. For this reason, the local authorities need to quarantine that area, instead of lock down the whole J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",

Satellite or aerial photographs can be particularly useful to create responses to natural climatic events by providing the top view of calamities caused by environment and infrastructure and how people are stranded across the area. GIS is useful for the imagery evaluation of disease growth, altering concentrations, or spreading of threats across time (Tosepu, R. et al.,2020). This imagery evaluation and visualization include number of techniques, like static map series, animations, and linked interactive micro maps. Moreover, number of advanced tools are used to create animated and visualized curve of an epidemiology for all the spatial units within the case study area. Curve magnitude and direction are shown in maps which help in visualizing the outbreak stage, magnitude, and geographic distribution.",

These results and maps of the descriptive analysis can lead to the hypothetical development of disease-causing factors, exposure locations, and the transmission mode. This information will help the field team to determine the requirement for doing more analytical studies in which to apply various advanced and modern spatial statistics to comprehend the geographic associations in different time periods and between disease and alleged dangers. Risk maps are used to examine and calculate data in an unchecked area or geographic regression practices by using interpolation methods and spatial overlays are deployed to deeply comprehend geographically distributed disease patterns or major risk aspects (Kaplan, S.
