There has been accumulating evidence suggests that the virus plagues people ubiquitously, although paediatric patients seem to present with distinct characteristics from infected adults. 3 -6 Between January 17, 2020 and February 23, 2020, a total of 3 children with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Baseline characteristics and clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected. Dynamic profiles of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results in throat swabs and faecal specimens were closely monitored till March 10, 2020, the final date of follow-up.",

Only one child had gastrointestinal symptoms. All children were in stable condition during the course of hospitalisation and none of them required respiratory support or intensive care. Their laboratory and radiological features were not typical for COVID-19. The three infected children showed good response to supportive and anti-viral treatment with a relatively short time to resolution. Surprisingly, we found SARS-CoV-2 remained detectable in faeces of paediatric patients for approximately 4 weeks, whereas negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory specimens occurred within 2 weeks after disease onset. Two children showed negative results for faecal detection of SARS-CoV-2 20 days after clear-ance of viral RNA in the respiratory tract, while another child persistently tested positive on faecal samples even 8 days after respiratory samples turning negative. Chronological changes in RT-PCR results of respiratory and faecal specimens are shown in Fig. 1 .",

Notably, asymptomatic infection is not uncommon amongst children. A recent study on the prevalence of COVID-19 in children demonstrated that 39 of 171 (27.7%) laboratory confirmed cases did not have any symptoms of infection. 3 An asymptomatic child had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in faeces at least 9 days after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. 7 It might be possible that asymptomatic children infected with SARS-CoV-2 go undetected and represent as important contributors to virus transmission in the community, causing the pandemic to propagate. Aggressive efforts should be made to prevent spreading of the infection in schoolyard environments.",

Another study on paediatric cases indicated that viral loads in the gastrointestinal tract might be greater than that in the respiratory system. Eight out of ten paediatric patients were positive for nucleic acid testing in rectal swabs after respiratory specimens showing negative. 9 Hence, SARS-CoV-2 may exist in the digestive system for a longer duration and convalescent patients with prolonged faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 may be an infectious source if fitness for discharge is based on respiratory testing.",
