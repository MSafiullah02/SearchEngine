Opsonisation is mediated by the complement system: C3b, C4b, and iC3b, antibodies IgG and IgM and mannose-binding lectin. Mannose binding lectin initiates the formation of C3b. Opsonisation of particles enables recognition by the Fc receptors, complement receptors or specifi c receptors for phagocytosis. Opsonins are generally proteins which can bind to pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) or other specifi c receptors expressed on the surface of macrophages. Pentraxins [C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P] [ 1 ] , mindin, collectins [ 2 ] and fi colins [ 3 ] are such opsonins. The function of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) is to recognise and enhance phagocytosis of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), specifi c patterns present on microbial pathogens like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria, lipotechoic acid (LTA) in Gram-positive bacteria and mannans in yeast. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are PRRs essential for recognition of microbial components such as TLR4 (LPS) [ 4 -6 ] , TLR3 [double-stranded RNA] [ 7 ] , TLR6 [mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 kDa] [ 8 ] , TLR9 [CpG bacterial DNA] [ 9 ] , TLR5 [bacterial fl agellin] [ 10 ] , and TLR2 [peptidoglycan] .

Adherence induces membrane protrusions, called pseudopodia, to extend around the attached material. Following fusion with the macrophage, the pseudopodia forms a phagosome that encloses the pathogen within a membrane, which then enters the endocytic process. Phagosomes coalesce with intracellular organelles to mature into phagolysosomes, which have an acidic environment with many digestive proteins which fi nally degrades the internalised material. Phagocytised material is eliminated by exocytosis. The process of phagocytosis is mediated by several proteins such as actin, dynamin and cortactin. While actin is connected to the lipidic membrane and responsible for invagination of the membrane to form the endosome, cortactin is an actin-binding protein which stimulates its polymerisation. Dynamin hydrolyses guanidine triphosphate and uses the resulting energy for the contraction of actin and formation of endosome. Particulates that cannot be digested remain sequestered in residual bodies within the cell. Other cells such as fi broblast, endothelial and epithelial cells also exhibit phagocytic activity and can engulf microbes like Shigella, Listeria and Yersinia [ 11 ] . Such phagocytosis is mediated by laminin and fi bronectin receptors/heparan sulfate present on the membrane surface [ 11 ] . However, the major cells responsible for phagocytosis are macrophages.",

The macrophages also regulate lymphocyte, granulocyte populations and important tumor growth modulators [ 13 ] . Macrophages act by both oxygen-dependent killing and oxygen independent killing mechanisms. The mediators for oxygen-dependent killing are reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) (superoxide anion, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite anion), reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs) (nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and nitrous acid) and monochloramine, while the mediators for oxygen independent killing are defensins, tumor necrosis factor (macrophage only), lysozyme and hydrolytic enzymes. Floating macrophages predominate in the vascular system, while tissue macrophages are localised in specifi c tissues. Based on the tissue of residence they have specifi c nomenclature ( Fig. 3.1 ). Macrophages can be classifi ed mainly into two groups: (1) pro-infl ammatory or classically activated macrophages (M1) and (2) anti-infl ammatory or alternatively activated macrophages (M2). ",

Conventional therapy when associated with side effects or necessitates long term treatment, results in low patient compliance. Further inadequate drug concentration within cells is a major barrier for effective treatment of intracellular diseases. Increasing the dose, however, resulted in enhanced toxicity. Mono-drug therapy evolved into multi-drug therapy, and enabled a good degree of success and continues to form standard therapy, even today. Classic examples include the multi-drug combination for tuberculosis AKT2, AKT3, AKT4 comprising 2, 3 or 4 drugs, respectively. The HAART combination for AIDS and two drug combinations for malaria are also examples of successful therapy. Nevertheless, the alarming rate at which drug resistance is occurring, and more so the emergence of multi-drug resistance are a matter of great concern.

Entry of the parasite into the brain causes cerebral malaria. Malaria can be targeted at the exoerythrocytic stage by targeting RBCs, or targeting the hypnozoites to tackle malarial relapse and further in case of cerebral malaria targeting the brain. Increased permeability of infected RBCs is seen after 12-16 h of plasmodium invasion through formation of channels. These channels are \"new permeability pathways\" (NPPs) which allow entry of molecules such as dextran, protein A and IgG2a antibody thereby differentiating the non-infected and infected RBCs. Such pathways could be targeted to enable high drug loading in the erythrocytes specifi cally through design of nanocarriers of <80 nm [ 241 ] . This could be supported through design of stealth nanocarriers which could enable long circulation, using various stealth agents like poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG), Pluronic, etc. [ 242 ] . Chloroquine liposomes anchored with anti-erythrocyte F (ab\u2032)2 were studied for targeting to erythrocytes [ 243 ] . Hepatocytes the residence of hypnozoites expresses the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which is overexpressed in infections. Targeting this receptor using nanocarriers anchored with ASGPR ligands is a strategy for hepatocyte targeting. Joshi et al. prepared in situ primaquine nanocarboplex of primaquine phosphate anchored with pullulan as the ASGPR ligand for specifi c targeting to hepatocytes. Signifi cantly, enhanced hepatic accumulation with preferential accumulation in the hepatocytes and a high hepatocytes/nonparenchymal cells ratio of 75:25 confi rmed hepatocyte targeting [ 244 ] . Transferrin (Tf)-anchored solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were intravenously administered for targeting quinine dihydrochloride to the brain, in cerebral malaria. Compared to conventional SLNs or drug solution the Tf-SLNs signifi cantly enhanced the brain uptake of quinine [ 234 ] .",

About 13 zoonotic diseases including brucellosis, tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, cysticercosis and others are related to 2.4 billion cases of infection in humans and over two million deaths annually [ 166 , 167 ] . Such infections exist both in domestic animals and wild life. The close proximity of humans especially with such domestic animals is a cause of global concern. The WHO policy of \"Cull and Kill\" results not only in the loss of lives but also heavy monetary losses to the farmer. Targeted treatment strategies using nanodrug delivery systems could provide a revolutionary strategy to benefi t both the animals and man. The benefi ts of targeted nanomedicine strategies are slowly gaining recognition as evident from a number of reported studies. Liposomes have been used by many researchers for treating various veterinary diseases such as Leishmaniasis [ 250 , 251 ] , Brucellosis [ 252 ] , Blastomycosis [ 253 ] , Babesiosis [ 254 ] , etc. Patil et al. [ 171 ] developed an asymmetric lipomer. This is a combination of polymer-lipid containing doxycycline which could have application in the treatment of intracellular infections that are primarily resident in the spleen like brucellosis, ehrlichiosis, etc. A number of studies are reported on horses infected with babesiosis, Streptococcus equi, T. gondii and Strongylus vulgaris infections using liposomes [ 254 ] , polymeric nanospheres [ 255 ] , dendrimers [ 256 ] and micelles [ 257 ] respectively. A recent study revealed the improved therapy of theileiriosis in cattle with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) of buparvaquone [ 258 ] . SLN revealed comparable effect with the intramuscular injection at signifi cantly lower doses. Nanodrug delivery systems have also been evaluated in dogs, sheep and pigs.

A rate-limiting factor however would be the serious concerns of toxicity. Nanodrug delivery systems due to their high intracellular delivery could precipitate new and unknown toxicities. Evolving strategies to predict the same is an important path forward. While vaccines could probably provide the ultimate cure and control, vaccine development is a complex process and not yet easily attained as evident from the limited success stories. However, designing nano-vaccines targeted to exhibit greater cellular response is also a near future prospect. ",

Interaction of the membrane-bound antibody present on mature B cells with the antigen, as well as the interactions of the antigen with macrophages and T cells, results in B-cell clones of corresponding specifi city.
