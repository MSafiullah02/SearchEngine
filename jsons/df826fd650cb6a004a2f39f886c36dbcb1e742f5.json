The risk of diabetes is increased, as insulin sensitivity is reduced in GHdeficient patients, and GH antagonizes the actions of insulin. This reduction is countered by an increase in insulin sensitivity by loss of central obesity and increased lean body mass in the treated state. We studied two groups of 20 patients of adultacquired panhypopituitarisml One group (A) has taken GH continuously for over four years; group (B) entered a four month placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Results suggest a progressive statistically significant rise of glycosylated haemoglobins. Two patients, one from each group, developed frank diabetes and required oral hypoglycaemic agents.",

            "text": "Most other studies show neutral effects on insulin sensitivity, with minimal incidence of glucose intolerance. This may be partly explained by the diversity of age, diagnosis (whether insufficiency or deficiency state), other pituitary deficiencies and replacement therapy, and possibly by dosage ofGH utilised in these studies. Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is primarily a nosocomial condition. Community-acquired disease has been described but the incidence is low \"). During a recent outbreak, we prospectively reviewed all new cases of CDAD to determine what proportion of cytotoxin positive cases were community or hospital acquired. During a 4 month study period, 73 cases were identified. History of diarrhoeal episodes were recorded for each case. Selected isolates were typed using pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS). Community-acquired CDAD was defined as diarrhoea, on or within 72 hours of admission, in association with a positive stool cytotoxin test for C.difficile and in the absence of hospitalisation within 60 days. Sixty-five cases (89%) were hospital acquired. Fifteen patients (20.6%) had CDAD on admission; 8 (11%) were community acquired, 7 (9.6%) had been recently hospitalised (4 at St. James's hospital, 3 at other hospitals). PMS typing of faecal isolates revealed that 2 predominant strains were responsible for the hospital outbreak; one of these strains was also isolated in community-acquired cases. This study suggests that the incidence of communityacquired CDAD may be higher than previously reported. We suggest that all newly admitted or transferred patients with diarrhoea should be screened for this organism. Several studies have confirmed that activated protein C resistance (APC-R) occurs in 20-60% of thrombosis patients and is therefore more common than congenital deficiencies in the inhibitors of coagulation such as ATII1, Proteins C and S. Homozygosity for the Factor V (FV) gene mutation is associated with a 50-100 fold increased risk of venous thrombosis while heterozygosity is associated with a 5-10 fold increased risk. The mutation, however, is highly prevalent in the general population, a prevalence of 5% has been reported in several European countries. Its frequency in the population of Northern Ireland (NI) has not yet been reported. We screened a group of 72 generally healthy elderly individuals (av. age 81.3; range 76-97 yr on several occasions for APC-R using an assay based on the prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time by the addition of APC. A mean ratio of 2.64 (range 1.72-3.46) was measured. Seven individuals (9.8%) had ratios <2.3 (av. 2.11; range 1.72-2.28). These subjects were then analysed for the FV mutation by PCR amplification and restriction analysis. The 4 individuals with the lowest ratios (av. 2.0; range 1.72-2.15) were found to be heterozygous for the mutation. None of these 4 individuals were deficient for Protein C, Protein S or ATIII. The frequency of APC-R (5.8%) within this NI elderly group is similar to that reported by others in the UK whose studies would have included a generally younger population. The successful ageing of these individuals perhaps underlines the low risk associated with heterozygosity. Alternatively a higher prevalence of the mutation may exist in the general population of NI, where the incidence of heart disease is one of the highest worldwide.",

The proinflammatory cytokines, TNF~, IL8 and IL-6, may mediate host metabolic and immune responses to cancer possibly leading to paraneoplastic phenomena such as cachexia. The cellular origin of these cytokines in the cancer patient, in many cases, remains unknown. We examined proinflammatory cytokine levels intracellularly, using flow cytometry, in PBMCs from oesophageal cancer patients (n=14) and age and sex matched controls (n=10). TNF~ and IL-6 levels were significantly increased (p<0.05) in PMA stimulated T cells and monocytes from the cancer patients when compared to the healthy controls. These results were confirmed using standard ELISA assays. Following cotlagenase digestion, increased levels of TNFa and IL-6,were detected in oesophageal tumour infiltrating T cells when compared to cells from normal mucosa. There was also increased production of TNF~ and IL-6, but not IL-IB, in malignant epithelial cells when compared to normal and halothane and maintained by 50% nitrous oxide-oxygen, 0.75-1.5% halothane, with spontaneous ventilation. TC rose marginally in group 1 and fell in group 2 (not significant, NS). TP in groups 1 and 2 at induction and 20 and 30 minutes were, respectively, (mean + SEM, Celsius) 31.4+0.33 vs 31.6+0.3, NS; 33.9+0.3 vs 33.4+0.3, NS and 34.5+0.4 vs 33.2+0.3, (p<0.05). Overall incidence of shivering-was 14.%, but not significantly different between the groups. The data suggests that preemptive application of the space blanket increases TP in paediatric patients during general anaesthesia and tends to conserve TC. Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) an uncommon, eczematous, photosensitive eruption is diagnosed on history, clinical examination, skin biopsy and abnormal light tests. Drug induced photosensitivity may look identical clinically, have a similar history and patients with CAD may be treated with potentially photosensitising drugs. We therefore reviewed all patients with CAD and compared their monochrumator light tests with patients who had drug induced photosensitivity. Phototesting was performed on unaffected skin of the back with an irradiation monochromator; the minimal erythema dose (MED) determined for a series of wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm, in 14 patients with drug induced photosensitivity and 7 patients with CAD. Of ten females, four males with drug induced photosensitivity, age range 40-77 (mean 61 yrs), ten (71%), were photosensitive in the UVA range (320-370nm), the implicated drugs including, quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalpril and prochlorperazine maleate. Three patients with rosacea were photosensitive to doxycycline. The re/nainder (29%), were tested after discontinuation of the drug and their light tests were normal. In the CAD group, (four males and three females), age range 38-86 (mean 71.5 yrs), three patients (43%), were sensitive to UVA, UVB and visible light, four (57%) to UVA and UVB. In conclusion, UVA dissociated from UVB photosensitivity seems a relative but not absolute sign of drug induced photosensitivity. This pattern of light tests should prompt a detailed drug history to elucidate the causative agent. Phototesting should be performed while on the offending drug as testing days or weeks after discontinuation will give normal results.",

Osteoporosis is most severe in those patients with cholestasis. A detailed profile is presented of all 632 leukaemia and multiple myeloma (ICD-O code 169) patients registered by the Southern Tumour Registry during the 8-year period 1983/1990 \"). Annual age-adjusted rates of 13.9 and 8.7 per 100,000 were seen for males and females respectively. These levels indicate a lifetime (up to 75 yr) risk of 1 in 68 for males and 1 in 116 for females. The main morphological sub-types registered were multiple myeloma (31%), CLL (25%), AML (18%) CML (9%) and ALL (8%). One, two and five-year survival rates were examined; age at diagnosis and lesion type were extremely significant factors in relation to patient outcome. The overall incidence levels indicate that Irish rates were relatively high by internatiomil standards r We assessed effects of reducing the volume of hyperbaric bupivacaine by giving half the volume as isobaric bupivacaine. When using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal blockade, the segmental spread and cardiovascular effects of the block have been shown to be dependent on the volume of local anaesthetic injected. 40 patients undergoing elective surgery were studied in a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial: Group 1 (20 patients) received their local anaesthetic as two equal aliquots of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine respectively; Group 2 (20 patients) received their local anaesthetic as two equal aliquots of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.",

We designed a controlled study to investigate whether there is a direct relationship between the degree of postoperative pain and the development of negative middle ear pressure in adults following tonsillectomy. Middle ear pressure was measured by tympanometry. Pressures were classified as type A (O to -99 mmH20), type B (flat) or type C (-100 to -350 mmH20) tympanograms. 30 patients with type A tympanograms, undergoing tonsillectomy were enrolled in the study. Patients had daily tympanometry whilst in hospital and then weekly until amrmalisatign. A questionnaire incorporating visual analogue pain scores was filled in at the same time. A control group of 26 patients with type A tympanograms, undergoing appendicectomy and endotracheal intubation was used. Follo~v up was available on 26 patients. 13 patients (50%) developed type C tympanograms, 5 patients 09%) type B and 8 (31%) patients remained unchanged. No member of the control group developed any change in middle ear pressure (Chi squared = 27.5, P < Vol. 165, 1996 Irish Journal of Supplement No. 2 Medical Science 0.001). There was no relationship between pain scores for throat pain or otalgia and the development of negative middle ear pressure. 8 patients recorded higher pain scores for throat pain at day 7 then day 1, only 3 of this group had negative middle ear pressure. Middle ear pressure reverted to normal at day 7 in 15/18 patients and in the remaining 3/18 it was normal at day 14. This study demonstrates the development of transient negative middle ear pressure following tonsillectomy in 69% of patients. This change is unrelated to the degree of postoperative pain nor is it associated with otalgia. Postoperative ward analgesia remains suboptimal. This may be partially related to inadequate early use of opioids to attain minimum effective analgesic concentration (MEAC). We examined the incidence and predictors of severe postoperative pain on admission and discharge from our postoperative recovery room (RR). Verbal pain scores were obtained in a pilot study of 202 patients on RR admission and discharge. Procedures were classed as open cavitary, laparoscopic, orthopaedic, ENT or body surface surgery. Intraoperative use and dosage of narcotics and nonsteroidal (NSAID) analgesics, anaesthetists' experience (prefellowship or post-fellowship NCHD, consultant) were noted, and RR opioid usage recorded. Pain scores and analgesic use were examined using Mann-Whitney, ~2 analysis and logistic regression.",

Adhesion of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) to pulmonary endothelial cells is an initial step in the inflammatory process characterising the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Previous studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have suggested that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent stimulus for PMN adhesion to endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LPS on PMN adhesion to human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). Human PMNs were coincubated with HPAECs _+ LPS (0.001-10mg/ml) with 2% serum for 1 hour. The effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (125 ng/ml) was also examined. Percentage adhesion stimulated by PMA was 66+10SD. LPS did not significantly increase adhesion at any of the concentrations used. To confirm the activity of LPS PMNs were incubated at 37~ with 0.01-10mg/ml LPS + 2% serum for 1 hour and labelled with flourescent antibodies to the MAC1 adhesion molecule complex (CD 18/CD 1 lb). FACS analysis indicated upregulation of both CD18 and CDllb. Thus in the system used, LPS did stimulate PMN adhesion molecule expression, indicating that the lack of adhesion reflects a difference in HPAEC response to LPS compared to that reported for HUVECs.

Although the relationship between elastin degradation and emphysema is well known, recent evidence suggests that a more complex process of pulmonary remodelling occurs within the emphysematous lung. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of extracellular matrix remodelling by ultrastructural examination of its two major components, elastin and collagen. Emphysema was induced in rats by the intratracheal administration of porcine pancreatic elastase (1.2U/g body weigh0 and human lungs were obtained at surgical resection for lung carcinoma. Emphysema was confirmed histologically in both animal and human samples by measurement of the mean. linear intercept. Matching sections were immersed in 2.5M NaOH and 88% formic acid to digest elastin and collagen respectively. Scanning electron microscopy with stereo-pair imaging allowed 3-D visualisation of elastin and Collagen frameworks. The distribution of emphysema was primarily panacinar in rat lungs a'nd centriacinar in human lungs. As expected in both types of emphysema, elastic lamellae were disrupted and perforated with multiple fenestrations. Accompanying this disintegration was a marked increase in thickness of collagen fibrils which in some cases coalesced Irish Journal of Medical Science imparting a sheet-like appearance to the airspace walls. Unique to human centriacinar emphysema, collagen formed helices which spiralled around alveolar septae to form bulky walls between adjacent airspaces. In conclusion, these findings lend support to the novel concept of aberrant collagen remodelling in the pathogenesis of emphysema.

In patients with limited disease, 20% were alive at 18 months and there was a 10% long term survival rate i.e. greater than three years. Average length of survival in limited disease was 456 days. Survival results were comparable with those treated with chemotherapy alone and combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In patients with extensive disease the best results were from those treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy with art average survival of 353 days. These figures compare favourably with those from larger multidisciplinary centres. The factors contributing to our relative success may relate to continuity of care achieved in a smaller centre.

Group A (45 pts, 54%) were responders with bed-partners; Group B (10 pts, 12%) non-responders with bed-partners; Group C (15 pts, 18%), were responders (12 pts, 14%) and nonresponders (3 pts, 4%) without bed-partners; and Group D (14 pts, 17%) had stopped nCPAP. Nine questions were directed at the bed-partner, and assessed their perception of changes in both the patient's and their own sleep quality, daytime alertness, mood and quality of life, and also to changes in the relationship between patient and bed-partner following institution of nCPAP. These questions scored from -1 (worse) to +3 (marked improvement). Significant improvement in all parameters for the patient (mean + SD = 2.4 + 0.7) were noted in group A. In addition, Group A bed-partners reported ~ubjective improvement in the same parameters (1.7 + 1.1). Group B improvements were less, (1.8 + 1.0 in patients, and 0.6 + 1.1 in partners). Overall, the data indicate a subjective success of therapy in 68% of patients, but the bed-partner's replies indicate this figure underestimates the true response rate. Furthermore, the results show significant improvements in the bed-partner's sleep quality, daytime alertness, mood and quality of life, indicating that successful treatment of OSA patients with nCPAP also gives significant benefits to their bed-partners.

Recent studies indicate that the ability of circulating neutrophils to regulate surface levels of adhesion molecules may be altered in disease situations. The aim of this study was to determine if changes in neutrophil responsiveness accompanies chronic inflammation in CF. Neutrophils in blood samples from 17 CF patients and 13 age-matched control subjects were analysed by flow cytometry for expression of L-selectin and Mac-1 (CD1 lb) following stimulation by interleukin-8 (IL-8) and fMLP. As expected, both IL-8 and fMLP provoked a decrease in surface levels of L-selectin and an increase in CDI lb levels. However, the magnitude of these changes was significantly lower in CF patients than in control subjects (Table) . These results suggest that chronic exposure to inflammatory stimulii in vivo may alter neutrophil responsiveness in CF. Given the emphasis on rational prescribing, we reviewed drug use in a 208 bedded long-stay unit. Prescribing patterns were analysed on an appointed day thereby obtaining a \"snapshot\" of prescribing practices.",

We assessed the clinical benefit of the newer markers of bone formation: osteocalcin (Oc), procollagen 1 carboxyterminal peptide (PICP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and bone resorption: carboxyterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (ICTP) and urinary deoxypyridinoline crosslinks (DPD) over traditional assays such as total alkaline phosphatase (TALP) and urinary hydroxyproline (OH/Pr) in 23 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Patients were sampled basally, then at 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post surgery and again at 1.5, 3, 6 and 12 months post op. The mean basal P1CP level was 89+26 ug/l (normal: 38-202) this increased to a peak at 48 h (168+_74 ug/l), then declined to normal at 6 weeks (116+56 ug/l). Mean basal urinary DPD levels were raised at 8.6+1.2 nM/mM Cr. (normal 2.0-6,0), they had normalised by 6 months to 5.9-+1.4 nM/mM Cr. Mean BALP levels were always normal, Although normal the yearly mean Oc level was significantly lower than the basal value. Mean 1CTP, OH/Pr and TALP levels were always normal. Therefore bone turnover in PHPT is best assessed by the newer markers PICP and DPD. We have previously described seasonal variation in fibrinogen with higher levels in winter. As fibrinogen is an acute phase reactant, the winter rise may be a response to seasonal infections. The present study investigates this hypothesis by examining seasonality infibrinogen and markers associated with infection: white cell count (WCC), interleukin-6 (1L-6), Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) antibodies. Monthly blood samples from healthy volunteers age 75 and over were measured for fibrinogen, WCC, IL-6, HSV and HHV6 reactivation over a 1 year time period. A rhythmometric method was used to examine the data for seasonality. Statistical significance was measured using the Fstatistic. A highly significant seasonal variation (SV), peaking in mid-February, was found for fibrinogen (n=24; SV=0.629 g/ 1; F=76.148; p<0.01). No significant seasonal variation was present for measures of WCC (n=24; SV=0.209 e9/l; F= 1.940; p>0.05), HHV6 (n=24; SV=0.065 au; F=0.653; p>0.05), HSV (n=7; SV=6.055 au; F=2.048; p>0.05) or IL-6 (n=7; SV=1.235 pg/ml; F=0.558; p>0.05). The present investigation does not support the hypothesis that seasonal variation in fibrinogen is a direct effect of the acute phase response, initiated by a seasonal variation in level of infection. The explanation for the seasonal changes in fibrinogen remains unknown. Increased plasma homocysteine and reduced plasma antioxidants are risk factors in the development of vascular disease. Design: 131 subjects drawn from elderly people living in the community (Median age 85 yr, range 60-102 yr; 81 female).",

In lower limb trauma where there is severe compound fracture, the successful treatment of this depends on adequate bone and soft tissue debridement. As a result, subsequent bone defects can lead to instability and often require large amounts of bone grafts, and major soft tissue reconstruction is reaquired to obtain skin cover. Large soft defects can by reduced bv primary bone resection and shortening of the limb.

The crying pattern according to chronological age was different from that Clescribed in term babies. In general preterm babies had a delayed onset of crying, but the pattern became similar to term babies when allowance was made for gestational age. The findings'suggest that the crying patterns of early infancy have a developmental basis. We re-evaluated 18 children who had had RS (1979-86), with their closest-age siblings using the Wechsler Scales, Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory and Achenback Child Behaviour Checklist (ACBC) (Duffy J. et al 1991). The RS patients' means were consistently lower than that of their sibs. However, comparison of mean raw data, using \"T-tests\", yielded significant differences only in the ACBC scores, in that RS children exhibited significantly more problem behaviours than their sibs (p=0.033). After categorisation of IQ data, further comparisons between the groups (using X2), found RS patients were significantly more likely to score \"below average\" in tests of Verbal IQ compared to their sibs (p=0.04). Age of onset and clinical stage were also found to be more important predictors of outcome. Children less than 1 year of age at onset of RS had significantly lower IQ scores on all measures of cognitive ability (p=0.003) and more problem behaviours (p=0.01) than children over 1 year of age. No significant differences were found in comparison with sibs. Clinical Stage to which RS progressed affected only Verbal IQ scores. Children in whom consciousness had been impaired had significantly lower IQ scores than both their sibs and RS children in whom consciousness was less impaired (p=0.02). In conclusion outcome remains cautiously positive, with 13/18 RS children attending mainstream schools or in employment without apparent difficulties.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that there is no correlation between the type of feeding & swallowing disorder the child has with the neurological diagnosis or the radiological findings. A further purpose was to develop a classification of the feeding & swallowing disorders which would guide us towards a management plan. A retrospective analysis of the data collected between the years 1988-94 from the feeding & swallowing clinic at Booth Hall Children's Hospital was done. 73 children were included in our study 9 Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 yrs. All the children were assessed by the members of the feeding & swallowing team and had videofluroscopic assessment by the same radiologist. Neurological signs, speech therapy assessments & videofluroscopy findings were compared between children with spastic quadriparesis & those without. Significant differences were noted. A clinical classification was devised using cluster analysis. We conclude that there is no causal relationship between the neurological diagnosis & the type of dysphagia. There are three distinct groups of children who require different strategies of clinical management.

In 1872 Francis Crumpe published a paper ~ in which he described the therapeutic effect of poisonous mussels (PSP) on a case of tetanus. He obtained the mussels from Tralee Ship Canal on the occasion of its infrequent emptying, and entertained the idea of using them in tetanus after treating a young girl with PSP who recovered after 24 hours. Prior to the use of PSP he described it's paralytic effect in two cockrels who both recovered. In concluding his successful use of PSP he speculated as to the clinical nature and role of the toxin Tralee Ship Canal was opened in 1846. The water was relatively stagnant and would have contained plenty of nutrients. As such it would have been an ideal habitat for toxic algae which may have been brought across the Atlantic as spores in bilge water 2. The emptying of the canal may well have been done at times of algal blooming. This is the first Irish Report of PSP and a most remarkable use of saxitoxin (?) in the treatment of tetanus, antedating the current management by seventy years. This study was carried out to quantify the published research on smoking in Irish medical journals; to ascertain the type of research carried out; and to identify the authors of that research. During the 35 years under study, 50 papers explicitly dealing with smoking were published. Only 2 papers appeared in Forum. There was a decline in published papers in the eighties with a resurgence in the early nineties. Of the 50 papers, a majority were observational and ten were editorials. Only one paper dealt with smoking cessation, and one with preventive work. General practitioners were poorly represented as authors. One doctor (Prof. R. Mulcahy) published at least one paper on smoking in each quinquennium since 1960. This study underlines the relative insignificance of smoking as a topic for research in Ireland. A major sea change in attitude will be required if the government's targets for smoking cessation are to be realised, particularly if they are to be achieved by relying on the medical profession.

Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) levels are inversely associated with dietary intake of folic acid and B vitamins and raised levels have been linked with CHD. We have examined the association between tHcy concentration and the risk of CHD in middle-aged men in 18 British towns. We used a nested case control study design, within an ongoing prospective study, tHcy concentration was measured in serum samples, stored at entry to the study, from 110 incident cases of myocardial infarction and 118 controls. Cases and controls were frequency matched by town and age group. Levels of homocysteine [geometric mean (95%C1) were significantly higher in cases than'controls: homocysteine 13.5 (12.6 -14.3)gmol/L vs 11.9 (11.3 -12.6)lamol/L; p = 0,005. There was a graded increase in the relative risk (odds ratio; OR) of CHD in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartile of tHcy (OR 1.4, 1.9, 2.2; trend p = 0.006) relative to the first quartile. Adjustment for age, town, social class, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, hypertensive status, serum cholesterol and serum creatinine did not attenuate this association, (OR 2.1,2.3, 2.7; trend p = 0.04). The findings suggest that tHcy is an independent risk factor for CHD with no threshold level. In summer 1995, a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis was made 25 in a child who had visited a pet farm.

There is little difference between the needs of the old long-stay and those of the new long-stay. Failure of the immune system to identify self peptides is likely to lead to the development of an autoimmune reaction. Susceptibility to autoimmunity is strongly influenced by genes clustered in the HLA region (chromosome 6p) particularly class I (A, B and C) and class II (D, Q and P). It has been suggested that there is an autoimmune component in the aetiology of schizophrenia. Of many conflicting reports from case/control studies using HLA antigens the most consistent finding has been an increased frequency of HLA-A9 (now split into A23/A24). Additionally, a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia has been reported near the HLA locus. To attempt to confirm the HLA A9 hypothesis, we have genotyped a preliminary sample of 63 familial schizophrenic probands and 77 unrelated controls at the HLA-A region, using a PCR-SSOP technique. The frequency of HLA-A24 (the major component of A9) in patients and controls respectively was 12.5% vs 15.5%. These findings do not support the hypothesis. Some of the discrepancy may be due to unspecific cross-reactions produced by commercial antisera used in the microlymphocytotoxicity method of previous studies. However it is also possible that the HLA associatton with schizophrenia may reflect linkage disequilibrium with unidentified gene(s) within the HLA region which is less strong in the Irish population. Schizophrenia is a common mental disorder affecting about 1% of the general population with a devastating disturbance of mind and personality. Family, twin and adoption studies have demonstrated that the disease is largely genetic with a polygenic mode of: transmission. Dopamine receptors have been implicated in the aetiology of the disease. As yet 5 dopamine genes have been identified (D1-D5). In particular the D3 receptor is expressed in the limbic regions of the brain, implicated in the control of emotions. Association studies of a D3 polymorphism (Glycine to Serine substitution at position 9,) with schizophrenia have produced conflicting findings, many of which, however, have demonstrated a significant excess of homozygosity, or excess of the 1 -l genotype at this polymorphism. In this study, 200 familial schizophrenics and 239 Irish unrelated controls were genotyped. The result show a small increase in the frequency of the 1-1 genotype which did not attain statistical significance (patients, 41.5% vs. controls, 38.5%). Homozygosity (alleles 1-1 and 2-2) was also slightly increased in the patients (patients, 55.5% vs. controls, 48.9%). The small increase in the frequency of the 1-1 genotype and of homozygosity in the patients is in keeping with earlier findings but suggests that the effect, if any, of D3 sequence variation in the development of the disease is small. Lack of information about general practitioners' (GP's) ability to prescribe psychotropic medication may affect patients' compliance. In this study, 73 out of 75 patients attending a psychiatry out-patient clinic completed a questionnaire which documented how many had run out of medication, the steps taken if they had and the role each patient thought their GP played in their treatment. 82% indicated that their GP knew what their current medication was but only 46% thought that their GP could provide them with a prescription if they did not have one from the clinic. This figure was similar in those who had (21%) and had not (79%) run out of medication in the past. On running out of medication, 42% of patients waited until their next appointment, 29% attended their GP and the remainder either contacted the department or went to a chemist. In conclusion, many patients do not appreciate the entitlement of their GP's to prescribe psychotropics for them. Literature regarding whether or not the social class distribution of patients with psychiatric illness may differ from the general population remains controversial. We sought to clarify this by examining social class at the time of birth, to see whether patients with serious psychiatric illnesses (schizophrenia and mania) differ from the general population.",

Ours is only a moderate sized study compared to some published, yet it is representative of the experience of most of the plastic surgery units in the British Isles. Clinically significant paraneoplastic neurologicaldisorders are rare, most are associated with small cell Lung, female genital tract and breast carcinoma. The malignancy is often silent and the neurological manifestations vary from encephalomyelitis, cerebellar degeneration, sensory neuropathy to neuromuscular block. Prognosis is usually poor. Pathogenesis is thought to be related to cross reaction with neurons of antibody produced to tumour antigens. Detection of these antineuronal antibodies in serum has assisted diagnosis of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis in which ANTI-HU antibodies are present and cerebellar degeneration, in which ANTI-YO are found. In our lab, we used avidin-biotin-complex immunocytochemistry to detect ANTI-HU (cortical neuron antibodies) and ANTI-YO (Purkinje cell antibodies) in patients' sera. Tests were performed on human frontal cortex and cerebellum, at 1 in 500 and 1 in 4,000 dilutions, with positive and negative controls. Of 68 sera, 6 were positive. Two patients had repeat positives; in one, antibody titre rose in the second sample. Subsequent patient review showed 3 positives (2 patients) had identifiable carcinoma with paraneoplastic CNS signs, 2 had no identifiable malignancy but had no other cause of their CNS disorder and are being followed up; details of one patient were unavailable. These results are similar to other centres. The proliferation of tumour cells despite the presence of tumouricidal mediators could be due induction of a heat shock response, a universal cellular defence mechanism in host cells and possibly tumour cells.

The study sample appeared representative of the advanced cancer population in the USA. Generally QOL was satisfactory despite the severity of illness. There were significant differences in all measures between those who described QOL in verbatim responses as positive and negative, particularly CAS, VAS, and QLI (p<0.0001). There were significant intercorrelations between QLI and PS (observer rated), VAS and CAS (subject rated) respectively (p<0.0001).

Pre-op blood was collected from patients and TGF-b levelsdetermined by ELISA. Conclusions: We have shown for the first time that SMo, defined by the antibodies RFD1 and RFD7, are present within breast tumours. We have also shown that the balance of T cell subsets is different in these tumours and may be related to SMo content. Circulating TGF-b levels are increased in breast cancer and associated with greater SMo numbers. This was not found to be the case in colorectal cancers.

Swelling of the upper limb is an uncommon but well Irish Journal of Medical Science recognised complication of breast cancer treatment. In severe cases, patients have limited arm function and feel disfigured. In a pilot study, the incidence of arm swelling following complete axillary clearance in the immediate post-operative period and at long term follow-up was investigated. Arm volume measurements were performed using an opto-electronic volometer (bosl Medizintechnick, Hamburg). Both ipsilateral and contralateral arm volumes were assessed. The expected volume of the ipsilateral arm volume was calculated using the formula Vr = V1 = 31 mls for right handed people and V1 = Vr = 25 mls for left handed people (Vr and V1 = volume of the right and left arms respectively). The difference between the expected and actual volume of the ipsilateral arm was expressed as a percentage of the expected volume. Twelve patients undergoing axillary clearance for breast cancer were prospectively evaluated pre-operatively, 48 hours and 5 days post-operatively. A second group of 48 patients who had had axillary clearance at least 3 months previously (Range 3 to 116 months) were also evaluated. There was no significant change in arm volume in the immediate post operative period.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen and has been shown to accelerate healing of epithelial damage both in the skin an.d the GUT. In the skin EGF is not produced locally as the requisite mRNA is not present but EGF receptors are present on the surface of basal keratinocytes. EGF is produced in various sites in the GI tract including the submandibular salivary glands. We have hypothesised that as there is upregulation of salivary EGF production in some enteropathies a similar situation may occur in disorders of the skin with an associated enteropathy. Using a sensitive radio-immunoassay, EGF activity was estimated in stimulated saliva from 87 patients with various skin disorders, 49 patients with gastrointestinal disease, 8 patients with mixed dermatological and gut disease and 41 normal healthy volunteer controls. Elevated EGF activity was found in the following groups of patients : skin cancers, psoriasis, acne, oesophagitis and ulcerative colitis. The hypothesis of up-regulation of salivary EGF production in skin associated enteropathy was rejected but the discovery of elevated EGF activity in skin cancers and psoriasis may have aetiological and therapeutic implications.

He also noted intermittent tender nodules on the dorsum of his foot and over his ankle over the preceding three years. The second patient, a 51 year old male, presented .in 1994 complaining of a 5 month history of tender nodules on his shins, and pain and swelling of his right ankle. Skin biopsies of the nodules in both cases showed medium vessel vasculitis consistent with polyarteritis nodosa. Neither patient had any symptoms or signs to suggest systemic involvement. The only abnormality.0n laboratory investigations for vasculitis was elevated ESR. X-Rays showed periosteal elevation and new bone formation in case 1, and were normal in case.2. Bone scan demonstrated increased uptake at the talo-navicular joint in case 1 and at the fight ankle in case 2.

No significant differences were observed between the different age groups for TNFa, IL-1 g or IL-6 in CD 14+ cells (monocytes).

This novel method of proinflammatory cytokine detection has detected increased TNF and IL6 levels in T cells from elderly healthy volunteers which may help explain some of the exaggerated inflammatory responses seen in elderly patients. Detection of proinflammatory cytokines by conventional ELISA or bioassay is problematic due to the presence of naturally Occurring biological inhibitors. Flow cytometry allows the simultaneous detection of both intra and extracellular antigens thus intracellular cytokine levels can be quantified while cell surface markers allow cell type identification.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced by inflammatory cells plays a role in tissue injury and inflammation. Taurine, a Bamino acid present in high concentrations in leukocytes functions as an anti-oxidant by scavenging the MPO derived oxidant, hypochlorous acid, to form taurinechloramine. Experimental colitis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats and randomised into two groups. One group received tap water whilst the second group was supplemented with taurine (4%). These groups were sub-divided into those receiving TNBS/ ethanol (n=8) or saline (n=8). An increase in WCC count, particularly neutrophils was found in colitis. Tat~rine was found to reduce the severity of the disease (NS) usin.g a colon macroscopic score. In the first group, respiratory burst activity was reduced in animals that had developed colitis (p<0.05) although MPO activity was augmented (p<0.05). Nitric oxide production was 2.2 and 1.8 fold respectively higher in inflamed and non-inflamed areas of the colon than that by normal colonic mucosa. Animals supplemented with taurine demonstrated attenuated M PO activity (p=0.001). Administration of Taurine did not lead to a reduction in Nitric oxide production. Thus, Taurine appears to have a beneficial role in reducing the severity of disease. A reduction in MPO and respiratory burst may be beneficial in reducing tissue damage.",

Haemochromatosis (HH), a common recessively inherited disorder of iron metabolism is closely linked to the HLA-A locus on chromosome 6. Linkage studies have demonstrated a close association between (HH) and the HLA alleles, A3 and B7 (\"ancestral haplotype\"). Heterogeneity at the molecular level may account for the variance in clinical phenotypic expression. The aim was to evaluate phenotypic expression of HH in the presence/absence of the A3-B7 ancestral haplotype. 32 probands (26M:6F) from unrelated Irish families were investigated. Phenotypic variability was assessed with regard to l) age; 2) % trans.sat.; 3) serum ferritin; 4) liver bx iron grade; 5) body iron stores and 6)symptomatology. Three males were homozygous for A3B7, 15 were heterozygous for A3B7 and 2 were non-A3B7. Symptomatology, trans, sat., serum ferritin and liver bx grade were not influenced by homozygousity or heterozygousity for A3B7. Conclusion: There were no significant differences in phenotypic expression on comparison of the three haplotype groups. No predominant genotype appears to be responsible for phenotypic severity in Irish families indicating the possibility of multiple mutagenicity of the HH gene.

Vol. 165. 1996 Supplement No. 2 Conclusion: This study demonstrates the importance of HLA typing in the clinical management of families with HH, Furthermore, in multiply affected families the incidertce of homozygous x heterozygous matings is high indicating the high degree of \"pseudodominance\" in the Irish population. The degree of acute hepatic failure after severe trauma and sepsis is related to the extent of hepatocyte (HC) damage and cell death resulting from either necrosis or apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that TNF-ct and LPS can directly lead to HC necrosis, but not apoptosis. Recent, studies have shown that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and nitric oxide (NO) are capable of inducing apoptosis in eukariotic cells. However, it is unclear whether ROI or NO are involved in HC cell death. The aims of this study were to evaluate the role of NO and ROI in HC cell death (apoptosis vs necrosis). HCs were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats, and cultured with the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or the ROI generation system, hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XOD) and H202. The effect of LPS, TNF-t~, and IFN-y alone or in combitmtion with different antioxidants and the NO synthase inhibitor, N-methyl arginine (NMA) on HCs was also assessed. SNP caused a dose-dependent increase in HC apoptosis. ROI generated by HX-XOD and H202 did not induce HC apoptosis, but were responsible for HC necrosis. TNF-ct alone failed to induce HC apoptosis, but when ~combined with antioxidants resulted in increased HC NO production and apoptosis. This effect was attenuated by NMA. SNP also induced HC damage and HC necrosis. Moreover, TNF-ct-mediated HC damage and necrosis could be further reduced by the combination of antioxidants and NMA. These results indicate that ROI preferentially induce HC necrosis, but not apoptosis. Induction of NO resulted in both HC apoptosis as well as HC necrosis, which suggest that overproduction of NO may be detrimental during the SIRS.",

We have recently demonstrated impairment of vasoconstrictor responses to endothelin-1, a potent endothelium-derived constrictor substance, in NIDDM and have suggested that this could contribute to the initiation of microangiopathy The purpose of this study was to determine whether responsiveness to endothelin-I is also impaired in IDDM. Non-specific vascular smooth muscle contraction was assessed using high dose serotonin Eleven patients with IDDM and 11 control subjects underwent forearm blood flow (FBF) measurement by venous occlusion plethysmography in response to local infusions of endothelin-1 (5 pmol/min for 60 minutes) and serotonln (30 la g/min for 2 minutes) Control subjects showed slow onset vasoconstriction in response to endothehn-1 reaching maximum at 35 minutes (p<0.01) The diabetic group did not respond to endothelin-I Group differences were significant (p=0.02). The two groups showed similar vasoconstriction in response to serotonln. In conclusion, vasoconstriction in response to endothelin-t is impaired m IDDM Non-specific vascular smooth muscle contraction is preserved. Impaired vascular responsiveness to endothehn-I is a possible common mechanism for the pathogenesls of microanglopathy in 1DDM and NIDDM. We measured total corrected (Tca) and standardised ionised calcium (lca) in a population of 76 intensive care (1CU) patients (with a mean age of 57+22 years, 59% male) to determine the prevalence of abnormalities in circulating calcium and its possible determinants Severity of illness was measured by the APACHE II score (acute physiological and chronic health evaluation).

The fully automated IMx instrument system offers ease of use and rapid results on a widely accepted and reliable platform. Streptokinase (SK), a 47kD protein produced by Group C b hemolytic streptococci, is a widely used thrombolytic agent. Anti-SK antibodies arise either as a result of therapeutic administration of SK or following natural mfection with streptococci Although the clinical significance of antl-SK antibodies is not clear, there is evidence that some anti-SK antibodies arising from natural infections can interfere with SK activity tn vtvo, resulting in thrombolytlc failure. To facilitate further investigations of these antibodies, we have developed and validated a highly sensitive functional assay, which measures SK neutralisatlon activity of serum independently of other circulating inhibitory factors in the sample, and a rapid and convenient enzymeimmunoassay for the detection of anti-SK antibodies. Analysis of over 200 random serum samples from the local blood bank with the enzymeimmunoassay showed the prevalence of antl-SK antibodies to be approximately 13%. All the positive samples and an equal number of the negative samples randomly selected were analysed by the functional assay The agreement between the results of the two assays was excellent indicating that our enzymelmmunoassay was a convement method for detection of anti-SK antibodies which could neutrahse SK activity m vitro Irish Journal of Medical Science tuberculosis drug therapy, isolation precautions and prophylaxis.

Strains of enterococci resistant vancomycin have been reported with increasing frequency. In 1995, we investigated an increase in the frequency of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) among patients in the haematology/oncology unit using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to genotype these isolates and to assist in establishing the source of these VREF. Eighteen clinical isolates of VREF from blood, urine sputum and-faeces and two environmental isolates were collected from separate patients between March and July 1995. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to several antibiotics including teicoplanin and vancomycin were determined by agar dilution. PFGE were performed following Smal restriction endonuclease digestion. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin; MICs >128 mg/ L and >32 mg/L respectively. This antibiogram is consistent with the van A phenotype. PFGE of all 20 isolates revealed identical patterns indicating clonal spread of VREE Subsequent implementation or infection control measures reduced the frequency of VREF isolation. PFGE proved useful in demonstrating clonal spread of VREF and.in emphasising the need for infection control measures. A prospective audit of baeteraemia in our 600 bed teaching hospital was carried out from February 1991 to March 1993. Clinical and microbiological data were collected on 520 episodes of bacteraemia in 78 patients. Of these 230 (62%) were hospital acquired and 200 (38%) community acquired. Urinary tract and respiratory tract sources were implicated in 30% and 14% of community acquired episodes, making E. coli and S. pneumOniae the commonest community acquired isolates (41% and 16% respectively).

Tonsil core specimens were cultured for bacteria including Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Ureaplasma urealyticum in 70 children undergoing tonsillectomy for recurrent acute tonsillitis. Serology for Chlamydia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was obtained in 55 of the children. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae in core tonsil tissue. Ureaplasma urealyticum was cultured in three children (4.3%) and Mycoplasma salivarium in two children (2.8%). Culture was negative for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The complement fixation test for Chlamydia species was positive in 16/55 children (29%) indicating previous infection.

To our knowledge this is the first report of HLGR for this enterococcus species. Plasmid analysis has demonstrated the presence of a single, large plasmid in all seven isolates, as well as several smaller plasmids in some of the isolates. Filter mating experiments have revealed that in all seven cases, HLGR was transferred to a laboratory recipient E. faecalis JH-22 by conjugation. Plasmid analysis of transconjugant strains confirmed transfer of the large plasmid in all cases. Based on restriction enzyme profiles, two distinct conjugative plasmids were identified for the E. hirae isolates investigated. At present we are using Southern blot techniques with oligonucleotide probes designed to hybridise to the HLGR determinant found in other species of Enterococcus. The results will confirm whether or not the same resistance determinant is responsible for the dissemination of HLGR in the genus Enterococcus. Dublin 8. Aminoglycosides remain commonly used in the treatment of severe Gram negative infection and have conventionally been given on a twice or thrice daily basis. Single daily dosing offers advantages with respect to less nephrotoxicity, better bactericidal activity, convenience, nursing time, cost and should avoid subtherapeutic dosing which has a significant impact on outcome. We reviewed serum gentamicin assays from January to December 1995 to assess potential toxicity and subtherapeutic dosing in patients who received once daily gentamicin and those who received multiple daily dosing. 4346 assays were performed in the study period. 520 of those were random assays and not included. There was a trend towards significantly less potentially toxic levels in the once daily group compared to the multiple daily group (p<0.1). Once daily dosing produced significantly less subtherapeutic dosing (p<0.001). Over 98% of peak assays in the once daily group were in the recommended range. We conclude that current practice of multiple daily dosing of gentamicin leads to significant underdosing and more potentially toxic trough levels. Measurement of trough assays only in patients who are treated with once daily aminoglycosides is sufficient and will have considerable cost savings. Respiratory, syncytial virus (RS virus) is a major respiratory pathogen of infants less than 1 year old. It occurs in annual epidemics during the winter and early spring in temperate climates.

Basal ganglia mineralization, HIV encephalitis (HIVE) or HIV leucoencephalopathy (HIVL) were not present. These findings differ considerably from those described in US cases, in whom the majority have evidence of HIV within the CNS. Relatively early death from systemic infection may account for the lack of HIVE/HIVL in these cases.

These patients were diagnosed by Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA) test and the presence of HCV RNA was confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Apoptosis was demonstrated in the biopsies by the Oncor ApopTag in-situ hybridisation technique. The average number of apoptotic hepatocytes per portal tract, and within the parenchyma per 10X objective, was determined. The modified Histological Activity Index (H.A.I.) was used to score each biopsy.",

Paediatric AIDS represents only 5% of cases worldwide, in most published series parental IV drug use was the main risk factor, CNS pathology was a late feature of the disease and antiretroviral treatment had been given. We studied eleven brains from Romanian children with probable postnatal HIV infection using standard neuropathological stains and immunostains for lymphocyte markers and HIV P24 antigen.

Three cases showed We studied the role of the p53 and bcl-2 genes in the pathogenesis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTL). Ten cases were examined by immunohistochemical and molecular methods. Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard and antigen retrieval methods, with the p53 DO-7 and the bcl-2 oncoprotein clone 124 antibodies. DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks and subjected to PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis searching for mutated p53 genes. Samples showing any evidence of aberrant migrations were further analysed by direct sequencing. PCR was also used to detect bcl-2 gene rearrangements. We employed a technique called Representational Difference Analysis to search for previously undescribed translocations or deletions which may be involved in breast carcinogenesis.",

Digestion with the same restriction enzyme removed the original linkers, and a second set of oligonucleotides were ligated to normal amplicons only. The tumour derived amplicons were subtractively hybridised to the normal and subsequent PCR was used to isolate fragments unique to the normal DNA (Difference Products). This was possible since oligonucleotides were ligated to normal DNA only. Following a series of further subtractive hybridisations and subsequent amplifications, purified difference product was obtained. Difference products in the size range 500-1500 bp were obtained.",

We have assessed bone formation in 8 patients (2 male and 6 female) with total protein S deficiency and 4 controls (2 male and 2 female) using two recently available sensitive markers; serum osteocalcin (Oc) and serum procollagen 1 carboxyterminal peptide (P1CP), both secreted by the osteoblast. The mean total protein S level amongst the patients was 40 _+ 12% (ref range 62-135%), mean Oc was 14.2 ng/ml (ref ~'ange 5.2-59 ng/ml) and the mean PICP was 81.5 + 15 ugA (ref range 38-02 ug/1). In the control group, mean Oc was 12.6 _+ 5 ng/ml and the PICP was 124 + 37 ug/1. There was no statistical difference between both groups using either marker. In conclusion bone formation as assessed by serum osteocalcin and P1CP appears to be normal in patients with total protein S deficiency. Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is a variably expressed neurodegenerative disorder which exhibits clinical and genetic heterogeneity.

Serum Vitamin B12 is frequently measured in the investigation of anaemia, and in screening neurological and other disorders. Frequently, patients are found with low serum vitamin B12 level with a normal Hb and without clinical abnormalities relevant to vitamin B 12 deficiency. This study was carried out to determine the significance of a low serum vitamin B 12 level. 959 vitamin B12 measurements were carried out over an 8 month period using a chemiluminescence method (Abbott IMX). Clinical data was obtained retrospectively. Of the 959 samples 81 (8.4%) representing 65 patients had a low serum vitamin B12 level (>180 pg/ml) with a mean of 152 pg/ml (39-179). Data was available on 44 patients. 20 (45%) had a Hb below the normal range with median serum vitamin B12 level of 158 pg/ ml (75-184). 19 (45%) had a normal Hb, MCV and MCHC with a median serum vitamin B12 of 152 pg/ml (52-210), and 5 had a normal Hb with an abnormal MCV or MCH.

Regional Centre of Dermatology, Mater Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin 7.Skin appendages undergo physiologically induced alterations during the gravid state. An altered endocrine status with the advent of a new endocrine organ occurring induces physical adaptations as the placenta produces its own hormones.Changes range from pigmentary alterations which can be either generalized or localized with the occurrence of a linea nigra to vascular and haematologic changes. Cutaneous benign tumours have been documented especially during the end of the second trimester, Appendageal changes affecting the hair with second trimester hirsutism and post partum telogen effluvium together with nail changes (Beau's lines, onycholysis and subungal keratotis) have been described.

Costs are tabulated below.PTMC and OSV patient clinical profiles were similar and all had pre-procedural assessment by cardiac catheterisation and echocardiography. Conclusion. Though consumable costs are high (Inoue balloon = s + VAT @ 21%), PTMC is cheaper than OSV because of shorter hospital stay and no requirement for ICU care'.(P.8) MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN RAT MITRAL VALVE ENDOTHELIUM FOLLOWING NEONATAL CAPSAICIN ADMINISTRATION A.

Kellett. Nenagh Hospital, Nenagh.The 4S and the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study reveal almost identical results, with an approximately 40 per cent reduction in coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality over 5 years from HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy. Decision analysis shows that the benefit and cost of these lipid lowering agents depends on the age of the patient and the severity of CAD present. Control patients in the West of Scotland Study had an annual mortality from CAD of 0.5 per cent: decision analysis calculates that life long HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy will gain 1.3 quality adjusted life years (qalys) if started at age 50 at a-total cost of IR~l 1,272 or IRs per qaly gained; by 70 years of age this gain falls to 0.17 extra qalys, costing IRs 1Rs per qaly gained. The average patient in the 4S study, on the other hand, with an annual CAD mortality rate of 1.6 per cent, will gain 3.06 qalys if treated from age 50 Patient with three vessel disease and an annual CAD mortality rate of 7.0 per cent, will gain 6.23 qalys if treated from age 50, costing IRs or IRs per qaly gained; 1.33 extra qalys are gained at age 70, costing IRs or IRs per qaly.

Phelan Department of Intensive Care, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin 7.Age has been proposed as a criterion for health care rationing ~ The purpose of this study is to examine the inhospital mortality for elderly patients admitted to our Intensive care Unit. Patients, 80 years or older, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ITU) between ltJan/'94 and the 1~Dee.~95 were included. Data recorded included the patients age, sex, source of admission, specialty, APACHE II score, and length of stay. Mortality rates in ITU and after discharge to the wards were examined.2336 patients were admitted to the unit. 66 (2.8%) patients were 80 years or older. 38 patients were male. Mean age at admission was 83 years. Mean APACHE II score was 18. The mean length of stay was 4.3 days. 15 (22%) patients died in ITU. A further 16 died on the ward. 46% of patients had an inhospital mortality Conclusions: Although the short term mortality rate for this group of patients seems high, the rate is comparable to other studies.

Beahan, S. Doyle, P Noone and C. Kdty. Biotrin International, 93 The Rise, Mount Merrion, County Dublin.With the growing awareness of Parvovirus B 19 the need for an efficient immunodiagnostic test for the detection of antiviral antibodies is becoming increasingly important Previous immunoassay development has been hampered by lack of sufficiently pure viral antigens. We have developed two immunoassays based on recombinant viral antigen for the detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies. The IgM immunoassay is of the Mu-capture format whereas the IgG immunoassay relies on the capture of anti-Parvovirus B 19 IgG by immobilised viral antigen. Both lmmunoassays can be completed within 2.5 hr. Assay evaluation showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95% for both IgG and IgM detection when compared against Parvovirus B19 IFA. Intraassay and interassay reproducibility were also examined and were found to be in the range 2-10% and 5-15%, respectively. Both immunoassays are sufficiently reliable and robust to facilitate routine use as Parvovirus B19 screening immunoassays.(El80) ECHOV1RUS TYPE 22 AND SUDDEN DEATH AMONG INFANTS K.

When the antigen retrieval method was employed for this antibody, positive staining was seen in > 10% of tumour cells in four further cases.Our results suggest that p53 does not play major role in PTLD. Bcl-2 overexpression but not rearrangement may contribute to the development of PTLD. Transplant arteriopathy (TA) is the major cause of death in cardiac allograft recipients. The pathogenesis is unclear. We have previously shown a plasma cell predominance in the infiltrate of TA, leading us to hypothesise a role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in its pathogenesis. An association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and TA has previously been suggested. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the pathogenesis of TA.We performed PCR for CMV and EBV DNA and protein (LMP) in seven cases of TA, involving cardiac allografts. Restriction mapping was used to confirm that PCR products were either CMV or EBV DNA respectively.CMV DNA was found in four cases. EBV DNA was found in six of the seven cases and EBV LMP staining was present in six cases. EBV was detected in all cases by either PCR or IHC.Our results suggest that EBV infection may play a pathogenic role in transplant arteriopathy. The evidence for a similar role for CMV ~s less strong. St. Vincent's Hospital. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive spasticity, primarily of the lower limbs. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive or X-linked manner~ We have identified a large Irish family (family A) affected with AD HSP that cosegregates with dementia. Three. loci have previously been identified that are linked to AD HSP in families of different ethnic origin. The locus on chromosome 2 is reported to be the major HSP locus. The aim of the present study was to examine family A for linkage to the chromosome 2 HSP locus.DNA has been extracted from blood taken from all 45 co-operating family members for genotyping. Polymorphic microsatellite markers from chromosomal region 2p24-21 have been amplified by PCR, electrophoresed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by silver staining. Linkage analysis was carried out using the LINKAGE series of programs. Linkage analysis excluded the HSP gene from the chromosome 2p locusl The most significant marker was D2S367, with a LOD score of-2.12 for recombination fraction 0.19, thereby excluding approximately 19cM either side of this marker. Negative LOD scores were also obtained for the other markers chosen (D2S391, D2S392, D2S352, D2S 174) excluding 20cM, 8cM, 4cM and 8cM respectively.The current study has therefore successfully excluded linkage of AD HSP in family A to the major locus on chromosome 2p. Further studies are underway to exclude linkage of HSP in this family from other candidate loci, prior to carrying out a genome wide search. The presence of dementia in this family in association with HSP suggests that a new and as yet unidentified gene is responsible. Vincent's Hospital.",

            "text": "Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin. CHED is a corneal endothelial dystrophy characterised by diffuse bilateral corneal opacities resulting in impaired vision. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance have been described. Another endothelial dystrophy, posterior polymorphous dystrophy (PPMD) has been linked to 20qll.We have used homozygosity mapping to analyse a pedigree with autosomal recessive CHED for linkage to 20ql.1. All affected individuals are offspring of consanguinous matings. Homozygosity mapping is based on the principle that these offspring would be homozygouS for genetic markers near the disease gene. Homozygous regions would be random between different offspring of these matings, except at the di-sease locus shared by affected offspring.DNA was extracted from blood taken from 22 family members, 14 of which have CHED. Allele frequencies were determined in pooled DNA from affected individuals. Pooled DNA from unaffected individuals was used as a control. At the disease locus, a shift in allele frequencies towards a single homozygous allele would be observed in the affected DNA pool. Pooled DNA was genotyped by PCR for 3 polymorphic microsatellite markers in the region of20qll. PCR products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and visualised by silver staining. Similar allele frequencies were observed at these loci in both DNA pools demonstrating independent assortment of alleles. In addition, affected and unaffected family members were individually genotyped at these loci and no significant loss of heterogeneity in the affected individuals at these loci was observed. These data indicate exclusion of linkage of the CHED gene to 20qll.",
