In 1940, a peptide that had vasoconstrictive effects in the RAS was discovered, and it was named hypertensin by Braun-Menendez in Argentina, and angionin by Page and Helmer in the United States. These two terms persisted for about 20 years, until it was agreed to rename the pressor substance angiotensin. In the 1950s, two forms of angiotensin were recognized, the first a decapeptide (angiotensin I: Ang I) and the second an octapeptide (angiotensin II: Ang II). Skeggs et al. in the United States reported that Ang II was formed by the enzymatic cleavage of Ang I by another enzyme, termed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Schwyzer and Bumpus succeeded in the synthesis of Ang II in 1957. Gross suggested, in 1958, that the RAS was involved in the regulation of aldosterone secretion, and then Davis, Genet, Laragh et al. proved his hypothesis.",

Cushman and Ondetti succeeded in the development of captopril, the orally active ACE inhibitor in 1977. After that, many experimental and clinical studies with ACE inhibitors uncovered additional roles for the RAS in the pathophysiology of hypertension, heart failure, and vascular diseases. Furthermore, losartan (Dup 753), an orally active, highly selective and potent nonpeptide Ang II receptor blocker (ARB), was developed in 1988, and the cloning of Ang II receptors, type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R) was accomplished in the early 1990s.",

An aspartyl protease with cathepsin D-like properties was shown to convert angiotensinogen to Ang I. Conversion of Ang I to Ang II in human and dog cardiac ventricles may occur by heart chymase. Unlike ACE, human heart chymase shows high specificity for Ang I and does not degrade bradykinin or vasoactive intestinal peptide. It is likely that the relative contribution of ACE and chymase to cardiac Ang II formation varies with the cardiac chamber in the human heart, because ACE levels are the highest in the atria and chymase levels are the highest in ventricles. It is recently believed that chymase plays a crucial role in various tissues because chymase can not only produce Ang II but also convert precursors of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 to their active forms, whose increases damage various organs.30\n",

The AT1R is a member of the seven-transmembrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family; it binds to heterotrimeric G proteins and lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The human AT1R gene is mapped to chromosome 3, and the AT1aR and AT1bR genes in rats are mapped to chromosomes 17 and 2, respectively. The AT1R is ubiquitously and abundantly distributed in adult tissues, including blood vessel, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, liver, brain, and the lung. The AT1R mediates all the classic well-known effects of Ang II, such as elevation of blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increase in cardiac contractility, aldosterone release from the adrenal gland, facilitation of catecholamine release from nerve endings, and renal sodium and water absorption. Therefore, the AT1R has a role in atherosclerosis, congestive cardiac failure, and several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, conditions in which inflammation is known to play a significant role (Fig. 2\n). Numerous selective and potent nonpeptide AT1R antagonists, such as losartan, candesartan, valsartan, irbesartan, eprosartan, telmisartan, tasosartan, have been developed.",

The cDNA and genomic DNAs of human, rat, and mouse AT2Rs have been cloned. The AT2R is mainly expressed in developing fetal tissues, and it is believed to have an essential role in physiological vascular development. The AT2R expression rapidly decreases after birth,19 and, in the adult, expression of this receptor is limited mainly to the uterus, ovary, certain brain nuclei, heart, and adrenal medulla. Unlike the AT1R, which has been shown to have subtypes in rats and mice, there is no evidence for subtypes of the AT2R. Although a comparison of amino acid sequences of AT1aR and AT2R in rats, deduced from nucleotide sequences, shows a low homology between these receptors (32%), The AT2R is also a seven-transmembrane domain receptor. In various cell lines, the AT2R-activated protein tyrosine phosphatase was shown to inhibit cell growth or induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). The AT2R inhibited AT1R-mediated cell growth, demonstrating an antagonistic action. It is believed that the expression balance of AT1 and the AT2 is important for cardiovascular diseases.8 There have also been conflicting findings regarding these receptors. For example, it is controversial whether cardiac hypertrophy is promoted by the AT2R. However, the AT2R plays a cardioprotective role on left ventricular function after myocardial infarction. In contrast to extensive data on the molecular and cellular functions and pathophysiological significance of the AT1R, the role of the AT2R in cardiovascular diseases remains to be defined. At present, the implications of overstimulation of AT2R by long-term use of ARB are being investigated in clinical trials.15\n",

Increased interstitial collagen deposition in the heart enhances cardiac stiffness and results in diastolic dysfunction. Fibronectin is localized on the surface of cardiac myocytes, connects cardiac myocytes to perimyocytic collagen and is believed to affect cardiac systolic and diastolic functions. Thus, increased ECM accumulation, and the above-mentioned ventricular myocyte gene reprogramming play critical roles in the impairment of cardiac performance and pathophysiology of cardiac failure. ECM proteins within the heart are predominantly produced by fibroblasts. Unlike cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts proliferate and increase the production of ECM proteins when the heart is exposed to hypertrophic stimuli such as hemodynamic overload. Thus, cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes play key roles in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.

Importantly, AP-1 regulates the expression of various genes by binding the AP-1 consensus sequence present in their promoter regions. Interestingly, fetal phenotypes of cardiac genes such as skeletal \u03b1-actin and ANP, and cardiac fibrosis-associated genes such as TGF-\u03b21 and collagen type I, have AP-1 responsive sequences in their promoter regions. Indeed, AP-1 activation has been demonstrated to lead to increased promoter activity of skeletal \u03b1-actin and TGF-\u03b21. Therefore, it is intriguing to postulate that JNK activation, in part through the activation of AP-1, may be implicated in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophic response in vivo. An in vivo study showed that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), one of the MAP kinase kinase kinases, plays an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac hypertrophy-related mRNA upregulation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, coronary arterial remodeling, and collagen gene upregulation.11\n",

Despite detailed investigations into the molecular mechanism of Ang II-mediated VSMC growth in vitro, this process is poorly understood. Ang II infusion, at least in part independent of its blood pressure-elevating effect, increased aortic mRNA and protein expression of fibronectin, which is an ECM protein that induces phenotypic change of VSMCs from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) may play a key role in Ang II-mediated VSMC replication in vivo, as shown by the observation that the injection of anti-bFGF antibody significantly inhibited the mitogenic effect of Ang II infusion on rat carotid arteries. Ang II infusion in rats doubled superoxide production in rat aorta by activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. On the other hand, norepinephrine infusion did not increase vascular superoxide production, despite a hypertensive effect comparable to that of Ang II, suggesting that VSMC growth due to Ang II may be specifically mediated by increased superoxide generation. Ang II infusion in rats increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA and protein in the endothelium.16 Because HO-1 is an oxidant-sensitive gene, it is possible that increased oxidative stress is a trigger for HO-1 mRNA upregulation in the Ang II-infused rat aorta and that HO-1 may serve to abrogate this increased stress caused by Ang II. Ang II infusion stimulated aortic thrombin receptor mRNA expression in rats, which was blocked by either ARB or the heparin-binding chimera of human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase but not by normalization of blood pressure with hydralazine treatment, suggesting that Ang II increases vascular thrombin receptor by AT1R-mediated superoxide production and may be implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis by thrombin cascade activation. The injection of Ang II resulted in increased oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake by peritoneal macrophages and increased macrophage proteoglycan content, suggesting that Ang II may accelerate atherosclerosis by promoting foam cell formation and cholesterol accumulation in the vascular wall.",

AT1R-induced ROS not only burns nitric oxide (NO) but also reduces NO formation in the endothelium by oxidizing tetrahydrobiopterin, a crucial cofactor for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS).27 Superoxide anion, a highly reactive ROS, is known to cause breakdown of endothelial-derived relaxing factor and dysfunction of endothelium. Regenerated endothelium has an impaired ability to release endothelial-derived relaxing factors, in particular NO. Activation of angiotensin receptors triggers an efflux of cytosolic calcium in endothelial cells (ECs). Calcium efflux activates PLA-2 to release arachidonic acid, which is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) to generate various eicosanoids including endoperoxides and various prostaglandins that activate thromboxane A2/prostanoid receptors located on the VSMCs causing contractions. Endothelial COX activity also produces ROS. In addition, uric acid, despite its known antioxidant effects, may cause human vascular EC dysfunction by local activation of RAS, inducing oxidative stress. ROS may, in turn, activate local RAS of whole vasculature, including EC, smooth muscle cells, fibroblast-enhancing Ang II production and concomitant stimulation of AT1R to create a positive feedback loop between local RAS and ROS. Thus, in hypertensive cardiovascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction is characterized by blunted endothelium-dependent vasodilations or enhanced endothelium-dependent contractions.7., 31.\n",

Unlike AT1R, AT2R contributes to maintenance of blood pressure by controlling the vascular tone through vasodilatation. Available evidence indicates links between AT2R and bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) in NO production in vasodilation.5., 12. AT2R stimulation by Ang II leads to an increase in cGMP levels through a mechanism involving B2R, causing NO release. AT2R activation stimulates bradykinin formation by activating kininogenases. Chronic infusion of Ang II into AT2R overexpressing mice completely abolished the AT1R-mediated pressor effect, suggesting vasodilatation by AT2R. This was blocked by one of the inhibitors of B2R and NOS. In addition, aortic explants from these transgenic mice overexpressing AT2R showed greatly increased cGMP/NO production and diminished AT1R-induced vascular constriction. Removal of endothelium or treatment with the inhibitors of B2R and NOS abolished these AT2R-mediated effects, indicating that endothelium is the primary site of effect manifestation by AT2R. The AT2R in aortic SMCs also stimulates the production of bradykinin, which stimulates the NO/cGMP system to promote vasodilation. In the AT2R-deficient mice, bradykinin-induced dilation is seriously impaired. Bradykinin-induced dilation is inhibited by AT2R antagonist but not by Losartan, an ARB. Thus, AT2R and B2R may form functional heterodimers, as recently shown, and this might lead to increased NO and cGMP production.1 The physical association between the dimerized AT2R and B2R initiates changes in intracellular phosphoprotein signaling activities and enhanced production of NO and cGMP.7., 15.\n",

Cardiac remodeling happens in certain physiological or pathological circumstances, such as exercise, aging, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. It is known that although AT2R expression decreases sharply after birth, it can increase again in some pathophysiological conditions. Stimulation of AT2R expression may inhibit neointima formation, cell proliferation, inflammation in vascular injury, myocardial infarction, and ischemic diseases, suggesting its protective role. Conversely, in AT2R-deficient mice, recovery from acute myocardial infarction was reduced compared to the wild-type mice.2 Although neointima formation and VSMC proliferation after vascular injury were exaggerated in AT2R-deficient mice, they were suppressed in AT1aR-deficient mice. AT2R possibly exerts antiproliferative effects and proapoptotic effects in VSMCs by controlling AT1aR.29 The number of apoptotic cells in the injured artery was increased significantly in AT1aR-deficient mice but decreased in AT2R-deficient mice, indicating that AT2R mediates apoptosis. Selective AT2R stimulation also inhibited restenosis after balloon angioplasty. Thus, experimental studies have shown a beneficial role for the reexpression of the AT2R after vascular injury leading to inhibition of cell growth and promotion of apoptosis. Gene transfer studies in vivo have also supported that AT2R expression attenuated neointima accumulation in injured carotid arteries by antagonizing growth-promoting effects of AT1R.

Although the mechanisms of action in the vascular system has not yet been well established, several studies have focused on control of the NO and O2\n\u2212 balance, which regulates cardiovascular function. A reduction in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity in Mas-deficient mice demonstrates impaired antioxidant properties in these animals.35 Moreover, ROS levels are increased in Mas-deficient animals. The Mas-deficient mice exhibit impaired in vivo endothelial function and increased blood pressure. The transgenic rats overexpressing human ACE2 in VSMCs, showed improved endothelial function and decreased vasoconstriction response to Ang II. Furthermore, the infusion of AVE 0991, a Mas agonist, increases the hypotensive effect of bradykinin in rats; one plausible mechanism for this effect involves an increase in NO levels.6\n",

The long-term Ang-(1-7) treatment induces atheroprotective effects in ApoE-deficient mice, an animal model for atherosclerosis. The improvement in endothelial function resulted from an increase in NO bioavailability, as the heptapeptide increased NOS expression and decreased O2\n\u2212 production. The genetic deletion of ACE2 significantly increases plaque formation in ApoE-deficient mice, which is decreased by targeted vascular ACE2 overexpression. Consequently, these actions of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas system may be exploited in the treatment of atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases.",
