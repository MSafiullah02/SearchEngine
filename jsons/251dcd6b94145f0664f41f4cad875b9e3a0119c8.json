The present study explores the role of tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII), a serine peptidase contributing to protein turnover by acting downstream of the proteasome, in regulating coxsackievirus infection. Inhibition of TPPII does not affect virus replication in cells with functional proteasome. However, when the proteasome is impaired, TPPII appears to serve as an alternative to maintain low levels of virus infection. Our results suggest an important function of TPPII in the maintenance of viral growth and may have implications for anti-viral therapy.",

We have previously demonstrated a critical role of the ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS) in the control of CVB3 replication within the host cells [3] [4] [5] [6] . The UPS is the major intracellular protein degradative pathway which contributes significantly to the regulation of many essential cellular functions by removing misfolded and damaged proteins as well as recycling short-lived regulatory proteins [7, 8] . We have provided evidence that CVB3 utilizes the function of the host UPS to enhance their efficiency of replication in the host cells. We showed that inhibition of the proteasome function by chemical inhibitors significantly reduces CVB3 infectivity in vitro [3, 5, 6] , and results in attenuated myocardial damage in vivo [4] .",

Tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) is a giant intracellular serine peptidase which exhibits both exo-and endo-proteolytic activities [9, [11] [12] [13] . It is believed that TPPII acts downstream of the proteasome to cleave proteasome-generated peptides into tripeptides that can then be further degraded into free amino acids by aminopeptidases [9, [11] [12] [13] . In addition to its role related to general protein turnover responsible for the maintenance of numerous fundamental cellular functions, TPPII plays an essential role in MHC class I antigen processing via further digest proteasomal products into smaller peptides more suitable for antigen presentation [14, 15] . Adaptive proteolytic responses to impaired proteasome function have been reported to play a compensatory role in the regulation of protein degradation. TPPII appears to make an essential contribution to such proteolytic activities that substitute for those of the proteasome in proteasome-inhibited cells [10, 16, 17] . In the cells with the loss of the proteasome function, TPPII has been shown to exhibit enhanced activity to complement proteasomal activities.",

HeLa cells were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of TPPII inhibitor (H-AAF-CMK) for 30 min, followed by CVB3 infection for 7 h. Proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, were used to show the effects of proteasome inhibition on CVB3 replication. The Western blot results in Fig. 1A and plaque assay data in Fig. 1B showed that treatment with TPPII inhibitor did not result in any changes of viral protein VP1 expressions and virus titers, respectively. However, proteasome inhibitor MG132 and lactacystin dramatically reduced viral protein expression and viral growth rate, in consistent with our previously reports [5, 6] . Our results suggest that the activity of TPPII is not required for the maintenance of viral growth in the host cells which possess normal proteasome function.",

HeLa cells were incubated with increasing doses of TPPII inhibitor in the presence of 5 lM MG132. As shown in Fig. 2 , treatment with MG132 led to decreased viral protein VP1 expression and virus titers.

Interestingly, we found that higher doses of MG132 (i.e. 10 and 20 lM) can also inhibit TPPII activity, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of MG132 on viral replication at these doses is a consequence of inhibition of both the proteasome and the TPPII activities. Finally, we demonstrated that a combination of 5 lM MG132 (a dose with no significant inhibition of the TPPII activity, Fig. 4B) , with increasing concentrations of TPPII inhibitor significantly decreased the TPPII activity (Fig. 4C) , but had no influences on chymotrypsin-like activities (Fig. 4D) .

We have demonstrated that general inhibition of the proteolytic activity of proteasome results in a dramatic reduction of coxsackieviral replication and virus-induced pathogenesis [5, 6] . However, the function of proteasome can to some degree be redundant. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors has been shown to be able to induce the development of adaptation conferring the cells with the resistance to proteasome inhibition [16, 17] . Alternative proteases to the impaired proteasome have been identified [9] . TPPII is a large serine peptidase which contributes to both protein turnover and antigen presentation by further degrading proteasome-generated peptides [11] . Increasing evidence has suggested that TPPII, under stress conditions, may compensate and substitute for the function of the proteasome [10, 16, 17] . The present study explored the potential role of TPPII in regulating CVB3 replication in the presence and absence of proteasome inhibitor and demonstrated an essential function of the TPPII in the maintenance of viral latency after the loss of the proteasome activities.",
