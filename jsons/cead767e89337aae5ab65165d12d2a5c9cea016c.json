JAH Intersection intends to deepen our insights into the health and well-being of adolescents and young adults in a way that can augment scientific peerreviewed research. JAH Intersection now has a dedicated Editor and Selection Committee to provide leadership and guidance. The committee decided to rename the Perspectives section to create a unique space within the literature dedicated to the intersection of the arts and science with a focus on sharing reflections about adolescence and young adulthood. Amplifying the multiple meanings of \"intersection\" is intentional.",

The New England Journal of Medicine has been publishing Perspectives pieces for decades, and similarly acclaimed journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the Annals of Internal Medicine regularly publish narratives, poetry, and art. In its previous Perspectives section, the JAH has published several creative pieces, including a poem by SAHM pastpresident Tamera Coyne-Beasley [1] and a \"A Letter to My Doctor\" by Melissa Engle, who writes about the complicated web of gratitude and empowerment that she feels as a young person with chronic disease in the hands of an extraordinary clinician [2] . In addition to increasing the person-centeredness of clinical care and research, written narratives and visual art have been shown to foster reflective practices in medical education [3, 4] , promote professional formation across multiple specialties [5, 6] , and enhance observation and communication skills [7, 8] . JAH Intersection supports the benefits of integrating the arts and sciences in ways that can contribute to efforts to improve adolescent and young adult health.",

We also gain a better understanding of our communities and ourselves as key stakeholders in health. Imagine reading a journal full of the latest breaking research and clinical updates on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and then turning to an essay written by a young doctor with a chronic lung disease struggling with the social obligation to serve on the front lines and personal risk she will undoubtedly accrue if she does so [9] . This is the case in a recent issue of the JAMA, wherein the deeply personal narrative of a young woman is additive to the medical community at large, who gain a better understanding of how this disease affects young people, health-care workers, and those with chronic disease in a deeper, more personal way. In the same creative vein, in 2018, the JAMA published two pieces of visual art by Dylan Mortimer, a young man living with cystic fibrosis [10] . Mortimer's art is a purposeful exploration of the infantilism that characterizes the life of an adult living with a chronic disease or disability. He intentionally uses glittery and cartoon-like mediums while portraying the gravity and mortality of living with a diagnosis like his. Both of these examples of written and visual art augment the objective science that medical journals offer.",

In this issue's piece, \"Silver Linings Pandemic,\" Dr. Zachary McClain explores the loss of everyday routine and familiarity with the onset of COVID-19, and the unexpected growth and joy he finds possible in seeing young people on their own turf [11] . McClain's piece offers not only a refreshing optimism that is welcomed during such trying times, but also examines the added benefit of technological innovation with our patient population in particular. Could it be that teens are more comfortable in front of a screen in their bedroom than in our offices? Might they feel less vulnerable? More empowered to ask questions and to ask for time alone with their provider? McClain sheds light on this all.",
