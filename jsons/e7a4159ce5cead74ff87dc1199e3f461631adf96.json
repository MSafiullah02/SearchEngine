The remaining viral genome is responsible for the expression of 4 essential structural proteins, including spike glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein 13, 14 . The SARS-CoV entry into a host cell is mediated by the interaction between the envelope-anchored viral spike protein and the host receptor, consisting of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 13 . Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 showed a high homology degree between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV as regards the receptor-binding domain structure, indicating that the new virus could bind ACE2 and infect humans (Figure 1 ) 3 . The spike protein is functionally made up of two subunits, S1 and S2 13 . SARS-2-S uses ACE2 for entry 15 . The former mediates virus attachment to the host cell membrane, while the latter favors the fusion of the two cell membranes 16 . This process requires priming by cellular serine proteases (TMPRSS2), which allow spike protein cleavage, regulating the entire mechanism 16 . The virus infectivity mainly depends on binding affinity with ACE2 receptor 17 .

Given the subjective nature, it is not surprising that there is marked heterogeneity in the estimates of patients with diarrhea symptoms 61 . The collection of reliable epidemiological information is fundamental, and it should be obtained in the shortest possible time to guarantee adequate preventive measures and to allow the best pandemic management. Data should be recorded with explicit diarrhea definition and characterization of number and duration of evacuations, specifying whether the symptom occurred at the onset or during the course of the disease. The use of the so-called \"big data\", could be a valid alternative to capture the growing amoutn of data in a short period as proven in a single Chinese experience 63 . In addition, some patients have diarrhea in the absence of respiratory symptoms, and this may lead to underestimation of COVID-19 cases, as further investigations may not be performed in patients with mild symptoms.
