The agents replicate to high titer in macrophages and dendritic cells, suppressing type I interferon responses, and disseminate to these and other cell types in tissues throughout the body, causing extensive necrosis and inducing an intense systemic inflammatory response resembling septic shock. Effective therapies are urgently needed to deal with laboratory accidents, natural epidemics and the threat of bioterrorism. An immediate goal should be the development of postexposure prophylaxis for persons who have been exposed to Marburg or Ebola virus, but have not yet become ill. This article first reviews current research aimed at blocking individual steps in the filoviral replication pathway, then describes efforts to characterize and modify damaging host responses. No direct inhibitors of filoviral replication have yet been identified, but some interventions that counteract suppression of type I interferon or modify inflammatory responses have shown benefit in laboratory animal models of lethal infection.",

Nonhuman primates are also highly susceptible to lethal infection, but the rapid progression of illness and high mortality in these animals indicates that they cannot act as natural reservoirs. For unknown reasons, the Zaire species of Ebola virus has been spreading among wild primates in central Africa, and a number of recent outbreaks in humans have been initiated by direct contact with a sick or dead gorilla, chimpanzee or other animal (Peterson et al., 2004; Pourrut et al., 2005; Rouquet et al., 2005) .",

No specific treatment is currently available for filoviral hemorrhagic fever, so the development of effective therapies is a high priority for biodefense research. Efforts have followed two general approaches (Bray and Paragas, 2002) . The first aims to identify pharmacologic agents such as nucleoside analogs, peptides, antisense oligonucleotides or other substances that directly inhibit viral replication. These efforts have had only limited success, but recent advances in understanding the viral replication pathway may lead to more rapid progress. The other therapeutic strategy attempts to prevent or mitigate illness by modifying host responses. This approach recognizes that the virulence of filoviruses for humans stems in large part from their ability to suppress innate antiviral defenses, particularly the type I IFN response, and their induction of a systemic inflammatory syndrome (Mahanty and Bray, 2004; Bray and Geisbert, 2005) . Interventions therefore aim to stimulate innate defenses while blocking damaging inflammatory responses. In contrast to the first approach, this strategy has had some success in protecting filovirus-infected animals, but so far efficacy has been limited to pre-or postexposure prophylaxis.",

Transcription is then performed by a replication complex, which in the case of Ebola virus is made up of four proteins (VP35, VP30, NP and L); VP30 is not required for Marburg virus replication (Boehmann et al., 2005; Theriault et al., 2004) . Transcription initiates at the 3 end of the genome, resulting in synthesis of a leader RNA and seven polyadenylated mRNAs (Sanchez, 2001) . Accumulation of the first two gene products (NP and VP35) in some way triggers a switch to the production of full-length, positive-sense \"antigenomes\", which are then used as templates for genome synthesis. The production of new genomes and their encapsidation leads to the accumulation of nucleocapsids in large cytoplasmic inclusion bodies visible in stained tissue sections (Figures 1 and 2 ).",

            "text": "The assembly of new virions begins on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where nucleocapsids apparently become linked through two matrix proteins, VP24 and VP40, to the cytoplasmic tail of GP2 molecules embedded in the cell surface. This process localizes to cholesterol-and glycosphingolipid-rich areas termed lipid rafts, which may provide a stabilizing structure for the assembly process (Bavari et al., 2002; Aman et al., 2003; Panchal et al., 2003) . Like a number of other pathogens, Ebola and Marburg virus apparently bring about their own release from the cell by \"hijacking\" systems normally employed for degradation or excretion of proteins. Budding of new virions appears to be driven primarily by VP40, Figure 2 : The filovirus replication cycle. Boxed labels denote processes that may represent targets for therapeutic intervention. Virions attach to cell-surface lectins and/or a specific receptor, and are then taken up by endocytosis. Fusion with the cell membrane within endosomes releases the RNP and other components of the replication complex into the cytoplasm. Viral mRNA is translated by the host cell machinery to produce virion structural proteins, plus, in the case of Ebola virus, a C-terminally truncated, secreted form of the virion surface glycoprotein (GP). Full-length GP is glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus, transported to the cell membrane and cleaved to form two units that remain linked by a disulfide bond as GP1,2. Virion assembly begins with the encapsidation of new genomic RNA molecules by NP and VP30. Production of filamentous virions takes place at the cell membrane, in association with lipid rafts. The process is apparently driven by VP40, which interacts with cellular proteins, bringing about a conformational change that results in its self-association into a progressively enlarging structure that forms the internal scaffolding of the virion envelope. VP24 may help link this structure to the central RNP core and/or to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of GP1, 2 . which is able to self-oligomerize on contact with lipid bilayers. The expression of that gene alone in transfected cells results in the extrusion of filamentous virus-like particles (VLP) that closely resemble infectious virus; their production is markedly enhanced by co-expression of GP in the same cells (Jasenosky and Kawaoka, 2004; Licata et al., 2004; Irie, Licata, and Harty, 2005) . Two overlapping \"late-domain\" motifs, PTAP and PPEY, in the N terminus of VP40 interact with proteins involved in the endosomal pathway: the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, which marks proteins for degradation or excretion, and Tsg101, a component of the ESCRT-1 complex that directs ubiquitinated proteins to endosomes (Jasenosky and Kawaoka, 2004) . Optimum VLP formation requires the presence of these sequences, suggesting that specific interactions between virus and host proteins are required for virion release and may represent targets for antiviral therapy (Irie, Licata, and Harty, 2005) . The primary product encoded by the Ebola virus GP gene is a truncated form of the protein that is released from infected cells (\"soluble\" glycoprotein, sGP) (Feldmann et al., 1999) . Synthesis of the full-length virion surface GP requires the insertion of an additional adenosine at an \"editing site\" during transcription (Volchkov et al., 1995) . The release of large amounts of sGP has been proposed to play a role in the remarkable virulence of Ebola virus for primates, but since Marburg virus is just as virulent, but does not encode a similar protein, the actual contribution of sGP to pathogenesis remains unknown. The GP of both Ebola and Marburg virus becomes abundantly glycosylated with N-and O-linked carbohydrates during transit through the Golgi apparatus, and is then cleaved by a cellular furin-like enzyme to produce two units, extracellular GP1 and transmembrane GP2, that remain linked by a disulfide bond as GP1,2 (Volchkov et al., 1998 ).",

Virus initially replicates in macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), causing their necrosis; suppression of type I IFN production aids viral dissemination. Proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, tissue factor and other mediators produced by these cells cause increased vascular permeability and coagulopathy. Filoviruses also spread to parenchymal cells in the liver, adrenal cortex and other organs, causing multifocal necrosis, while destruction of macrophages and DC causes extensive injury to the spleen and other lymphoid tissues. Massive 'bystander' apoptosis of lymphocytes is apparently brought about through mediator effects and loss of DC support. NO: nitric oxide.",

Basler et al. have identified such suppression with the Ebola VP35 protein, which can functionally replace the influenza NS1 to inhibit IFN production by infected cells (Basler et al., 2000) . VP35 appears to act by blocking the recognition of dsRNA, preventing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon response factor-3 and the transcription of a series of IFN-related genes (Basler et al., 2003; Hartman, Towner, and Nichol, 2004; Basler, 2005) .

In marked contrast to primates, normal adult mice are solidly resistant to all wild-type filoviruses. However, they can be rendered sensitive to lethal infection by Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan virus through treatment with anti-IFN-\u03b1 antibodies, and knockout mice lacking the STAT-1 protein or the cell-surface IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor are rapidly killed by these and other filoviruses (Bray, 2001) . Further evidence of the critical role of type I IFN responses has been obtained using a variant of Ebola Zaire virus that is lethal for adult mice, which was obtained through sequential passage in suckling mice of virus from the 1976 outbreak (Bray et al., 1998; Gibb et al., 2001) . The LD 50 of this \"mouse-adapted virus\" by the intraperitoneal route is approximately one virion; infection induces only a low level of IFN-\u03b1 production, that first becomes detectable in serum when the animals are already ill. Remarkably, mice remain healthy when inoculated subcutaneously with the same virus; in this case, infection results in the rapid production of large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 (Mahanty et al., 2003a ).",

These findings also serve as a reminder that viral replication, inflammation and coagulation should not be thought of as independent processes. Instead, they form such a tightly interlinked matrix that the inhibition of coagulation can \"feed back\" to suppress the first two components. The mechanism of communication between the induction of coagulation and other macrophage activities may be signalling from the cytoplasmic tails of cell-surface TF molecules (Ruf, 2004) .

If confirmed in larger, placebo-controlled experiments, these results would be in agreement with observations from clinical trials in septic shock, which suggest that proinflammatory cytokine responses play a protective role early in infection, but are harmful if they continue for too long or are expressed in an unregulated manner (Hotchkiss and Karl, 2003) .",
