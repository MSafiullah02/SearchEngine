            "text": "Polyamines are small, abundant, flexible, biomolecules that consist of carbon chains containing amino groups that give them a positive charge at cellular pH. Eukaryotes have three polyamines that are synthesized in a stepwise process from arginine. Arginine is converted to ornithine, which is decarboxylated via ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) to putrescine. Putrescine is converted to spermidine via spermidine synthase (SRM) followed by conversion to spermine via spermine synthase (SMS). The overview of this pathway can be seen in Figure 1. Spermine and spermidine can be catabolized back to putrescine by the addition of an acetyl group by spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SAT1) followed by polyamine oxidase (PAOX). Spermine can also be catabolized back to spermidine via spermine oxidase (SMOX). Polyamine synthesis and degradation are tightly controlled metabolic processes in which polyamines regulate their own synthesis (reviewed in [1]). ODC-1 antizyme (OAZ1) regulates the turnover of ODC1, in which OAZ1 translation is regulated by a frameshifting mechanism that is polyamine dependent. OAZ1 itself is inhibited by antizyme (AZIN). SAMDC, an enzyme that is crucial for the conversion of putrescine to spermidine and spermine is regulated by an upstream ORF (uORF), at which ribosomes pause prior to the stop codon, stalling scanning ribosomes from initiating the translation of SAMDC [2]. Spermidine and spermine levels enhance this pause; thus, high levels of these molecules precludes their synthesis. Finally, SAT1 activity, transcription, and translation is regulated by polyamines, with high polyamine content leading to enhanced SAT1 levels and activity (reviewed in [3]). ODC and SAMDC can also be inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) production through the nitroslyation of a cysteine in the active site [4] (reviewed in [5]). Overall, polyamine synthesis is a highly regulated process, and the cell expends considerable energy in maintaining homeostatic polyamine levels.",

            "text": "Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine all play key roles in a wide variety of cellular processes (Figure 2). Due to their charge, they bind nucleic acids as well as affect chromatin structure [6]. In brain tumor cells depleted of polyamines, chromatin condensation was negatively affected [7]. Polyamines also promote the Z-DNA conformation and stabilize the DNA quadruplex conformation of c-myc, resulting in the overexpression of c-myc [8,9]. This acts as a positive feedback loop due to the ODC, SRM, and SMS genes being transcriptional targets of c-myc [10,11]. Spermidine has been shown to be essential for cell proliferation in eukaryotes, specifically for the hypusination of eIF5A, an initiation factor that regulates translation of a variety of cellular proteins. Hypusination is unique to eIF5A, and the current model of its function is in the translation of \u201chard-to-translate\u201d regions of polypeptides, such as polyproline tracts. Recent work has shown that hypusination promotes autophagy in B cells [12] and the expression of oxidative phosphorylation proteins in macrophages [13]. Additionally, polyamines regulate membrane fluidity: positively charged polyamines interact with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups to reduce lipid movement. Polyamines also regulate ion channel function, protein\u2013RNA interactions, and cell junctions, among others. All of these critical roles within the cell are also crucial for virus infection, suggesting that these molecules that are important for cellular functions also play roles in virus infection.",

In fact, bacteriophages were critical systems that first established a role for polyamines in virus infection. A subset of both DNA and RNA bacteriophages package polyamines within the virions. In bacteriophage R17, for instance, spermidine and putrescine were identified within virions, specifically associating with the viral RNA. Quantifying viral particles and polyamines, the authors estimated approximately 1000 polyamines per viral particle, enough to neutralize approximately 50% of the genome\u2019s negative charge. The authors hypothesized that polyamines specifically functioned to neutralize such as putrescine and spermidine could be replaced with either spermine or Mg2+. Work on bacteriophage T4 demonstrated that E. coli growth conditions affect phage polyamine content. Phages harvested from agitated medium incorporated low levels of polyamines; however, phage isolated from anaerobic conditions incorporated cadaverine, which is a polyamine formed via lysine decarboxylation [14]. Thus, at least in the case of bacteriophage T4, the metabolic state of the infected cell affects polyamine incorporation in the virion. These phage-associated polyamines were largely considered to bind nucleic acids and enhance compaction, contributing significantly to phage stabilization [15].",

When bacteriophage T4 infects polyamine-depleted E. coli K-12, phage DNA synthesis and virion maturation were significantly reduced. Work with bacteriophage f2 using polyamine auxotrophic E. coli also demonstrated a role for polyamines in phage translation [16]. Bacteriophages also manipulate bacterial polyamine levels, presumably to enhance phage functions. For instance, bacteriophage R17 promotes spermidine accumulation in the infected E. coli cell [17,18]. However, this phenotype is not shared with all bacteriophages. For instance, bacteriophage T4 infection results in no change in cellular polyamine synthesis or accumulation [19,20]. This work in bacteriophages highlighted that polyamines were crucial regulators of viral processes in prokaryotes, and later work soon demonstrated a role for polyamines in eukaryotic viruses as well.",

Akin to select bacteriophages, plant viruses incorporate polyamines. For instance, purified turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) contains spermidine and spermine at levels approximately twice the cellular concentration of these molecules [21,22,23,24]. When cellular polyamine pools were shifted to reduce spermidine levels, higher levels of spermine were incorporated into purified virions, suggesting flexibility in polyamine packaging for TYMV [21]. In contrast, belladonna mosaic virus (BDMV) incorporates putrescine and spermidine, potentially for maintaining virion stability at alkaline pH [25,26]. However, these polyamines could be replaced with potassium ions, although this resulted in reduced virion stability [25]. Several plant viruses, including turnip crinkle and tobacco mosaic virus incorporate the polyamine bis(3-aminopropyl)amine, which appears to be specifically present in infected but not healthy plants [22]. However, whether the incorporation of this modified polyamine is to the virus\u2019 benefit is unclear. Further, whether packaged polyamines enhance virion stability or have other virion functions for these diverse viruses is unknown.",

For example, in tobacco mosaic virus infection, polyamine levels rise [27]. However, these polyamines are rapidly degraded by polyamine oxidases, which are also upregulated in the tobacco plant upon virus infection. As a by-product of polyamine oxidation, hydrogen peroxide is produced, which induces cellular death and precludes virus replication [28], as part of the hypersensitive response. Interestingly, these phenotypes are observed only in plants that induce the hypersensitive response and not in plants that are susceptible to TMV infection. Much remains to be understood of precisely how polyamines function in virus infections of plants, however.",

This virus evolved to encode entire metabolic pathways, including a polyamine biosynthetic pathway [29]. The ornithine decarboxylase [30] and polyamine acetyltransferase [31] have been cloned, and their biochemical activity verified, thus identifying these as the first virally-encoded polyamine genes. Additionally, PBCV-1 encodes a homospermidine synthase molecule, in addition to a spermidine synthase enzyme, that produces homospermidine from two putrescine molecules [32]. However, the precise roles of these enzymes and the polyamines they produce are unknown, either during infection or in the context of the PBCV-1 virion. Further, whether other related viruses encode similar pathways or rely on host pathways for virus multiplication is unexplored. Thus, the implications for polyamines in algae\u2013virus ecology are unclear.",

To date, roles for polyamines in mammalian viruses include viral entry, transcription, replication, and virion packaging. While the earliest reports of polyamines in bacteriophages was in the late 1950s [33], it was not until 1971 that polyamines were found in a human virus. This virus was the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), and it was found to contain spermine in the nucleocapsid and spermidine in the viral envelope [34]. Later, it was shown that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) stimulated ODC1 activity and increased polyamine uptake, presumably to enhance cellular polyamine levels. The inhibition of polyamine metabolism after the eclipse phase did not affect viral replication, suggesting that polyamines may not play a role late in infection but may have roles early in infection [35,36,37].",

In vitro genome synthesis assays demonstrated that polyamines enhanced viral polymerase activity, similar to bacteriophage T7 polymerase [46]. In addition to roles in polymerase activity, CHIKV, ZIKV, and HCV translation rely on polyamines, as DFMO-treated (polyamine depleted via ODC1 inhibition) cells exhibited reduced viral translation [43,47]. Further work in Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV) highlighted that polyamines function in transcription from viral genomes, but the translation of these transcripts relied on polyamines through eIF5A hypusination (Figure 3) [48,49]. The knockdown of eIF5A or inhibition of the enzymes involved in its hypusination resulted in significant decreases in the accumulation of viral proteins. Further, hypusination inhibition reduced EBOV and MARV infectious titers. In sum, these data suggest that polyamines function in the transcription and translation of mammalian viruses and also highlight opportunities to target viral replication through polyamines and hypusination.",

Several of the ISGs are metabolic enzymes, including SAMHD1 and IDO1, which deplete nucleotides and tryptophan, respectively, to limit virus replication [53]. Given their importance in virus replication, polyamines are similarly depleted upon virus infection. Upon signaling through interferon \u03b1/\u03b2, SAT1 is induced and depletes cellular polyamines. In fact, SAT1 knockout cells replicate virus to higher titers than wild-type cells when treated with type I interferon. Prior work also highlighted that ODC1 activity decreases with interferon \u03b1, \u03b2, or \u03b3 treatment, although the effect on polyamine levels was not investigated [54]. In a separate study, the intraperitoneal delivery of interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 inhibited ODC1 activity in mice. Thus, polyamine depletion is a strategy by which mammalian cells can reduce viral infection. Since transient polyamine depletion is well-tolerated by most cells, temporary polyamine depletion to limit infection may be a reasonable strategy to limit virus infection and maintain cellular viability.",

Perhaps the most extreme example is PBCV-1, described above, which encodes an entire polyamine biosynthesis pathway in its dsDNA genome [29]. This implies that polyamines are vital for these viruses to infect hosts; however, little is known about polyamines\u2019 exact roles in infection. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) has also been shown to manipulate polyamine levels in cells by decreasing the expression of SAT1, which is a polyamine catabolic enzyme that acetylates spermidine and spermine, causing them to be degraded or expelled out of the cell [55]. Additionally, EBV is also able to stabilize c-myc through its nuclear antigen 3C, resulting in overexpression of the polyamine synthesis proteins [56]. This overexpression of c-myc could be the cause of the downregulation of SAT1, but whether polyamines are directly involved in this process is still unknown. Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) was also shown to upregulate the expression of SAMDC mRNA in infected cells [57] and human cytomegalovirus, another herpesvirus, stimulates ODC1 activity [35]. A distantly related virus, bovine herpes virus, encodes an ODC-like protein that shares around 55% amino acid homology with mammalian ODC and contained all the amino acids necessary for decarboxylase activity [58]. Whether additional viruses manipulate polyamine levels and the mechanisms involved therein is unknown. Interestingly, the viruses described above that manipulate polyamine levels are DNA viruses, and, in the case of herpesviruses, result in permanent infection of the host. Whether acute viruses, similar to many of the RNA viruses described above, affect polyamine levels remains to be explored. However, recent work has demonstrated that HCV induces polyamine metabolic genes, including ODC1, SAT1, and SMOX during infection, overall resulting in reduced polyamine levels in cells harboring an HCV replicon [59]. Whether this observation is true for other RNA viruses, particularly acute RNA viruses, is unknown; regardless, viruses have evolved strategies to interface with polyamines in infected cells.",

Polyamines play a wide role in key metabolic processes including nucleotide metabolism, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid metabolism, among many other metabolic pathways described to interface in mammalian cells (Figure 5). Thus, polyamines likely affect virus replication through the modulation of these distinct cellular metabolic pathways. Polyamines play a role in nucleotide pools due to the requirement of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) to act as the aminopropyl group donor. When cells were treated with DFMO, dcSAM was synthesized at normal levels, leading to higher levels of ATP/ADP as well as higher levels of the ribonucleotides UTP and CTP [60]. Polyamine depletion via DFMO also induces thymidine depletion in colon tumors [61]. Another link between polyamines and nucleotides was demonstrated in a study with the broad spectrum antiviral ribavirin, which resembles guanosine [62]. Treated cells exhibited higher levels of SAT1 and decreased polyamine levels; when guanosine was added exogenously to these treated cells, polyamine levels were restored, and viral titers were partially recovered [63]. This partial recovery of viral titers suggests that a portion of ribavirin\u2019s antiviral activity is through polyamines and highlights the connectedness between nucleotide and polyamine synthesis.",

The turnover of spermidine and spermine via PAOX results in the generation of hydrogen peroxide in cells. However, both spermidine and spermine have been shown to neutralize ROS and are important for the prevention of oxidative damage [66,67]. Interestingly, the SAT1 gene is targeted by p53, and SAT1 expression causes an increase in lipid peroxidation, stimulating cells to undergo ferroptosis [68]. Many viruses, including hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus induce ROS formation during infection [69,70,71,72]. Polyamines may play a role in neutralizing these ROS, since their generation can cause a ferroptotic response and potentially draw unwanted attention from immune cells to the infected area. However, polyamines may not be beneficial for all viruses and may actually inhibit some stages of infection. The M2 protein of influenza, which plays a role in viral uncoating, can be inhibited by polyamines [73]. Influenza also causes an increase in NO, through interferon \u03b3, which inhibits ODC1. Whether these processes aid influenza virus in subsequent cellular entry has yet to be explored.",

However, anti-cancer therapies targeting polyamines were largely unsuccessful initially. However, continued work on polyamines in the development and progression of cancer remains an active area of research.

DFMO treatment results in significant reductions in polyamine levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner in multiple cell types [75]. Clinically, DFMO is effective against trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, with mild side effects including reversible ototoxicity. The trypanosomal ODC1 is highly sensitive to DFMO, resulting in the reduction of polyamines in the parasite and clearance by infected individuals [76,77,78,79]. In fact, DFMO is a frontline drug in the treatment of trypanosomiasis and is on the list of the World Health Organization\u2019s essential medicines [80]. DFMO can be taken orally, topically, or intravenously. Treated individuals experience mild side effects, including thrombocytopenia, although these effects are reversible upon the cessation of treatment [81]. DFMO inhibits infection by several viruses, both in vitro and in vivo [43,52]. Thus, DFMO administration may be a promising route to quell virus replication. However, virus infection is best reduced with DFMO pretreatment, and treatment post-exposure requires significant additional investigation. Nonetheless, prophylactic DFMO treatment may be reasonable in certain instances, such as to protect healthcare workers, uninfected contacts of infected patients, or immunocompromised individuals.",

Additionally, molecules such as MDL 72757, targeting polyamine interconversion [84], exhibit antiviral activity in vitro [48]. Another highly promising category of molecules targeting polyamine metabolism are the hypusination inhibitors GC7, deferiprone, and ciclopirox. A recent review summarizes the promise of these molecules as antiviral agents [85]. Studies by Olsen and colleagues [48,49] demonstrated the efficacy of these inhibitors against Ebola virus infection, and prior work showed that HIV-1 is similarly sensitive to this group of inhibitors [86]. In sum, several polyamine-targeting molecules show activity against viruses, and further work into their mechanisms of action, toxicity, and in vivo activity is required for the possibility of targeting polyamines to treat or prevent viral infection.",

            "text": "Viruses evolve intimate relationships with host cells and their metabolites. While we are beginning to understand how viruses interface with metabolites within cells, much remains to be uncovered. A broad base of literature surrounding polyamines and viruses, from the 1950s to the present day, suggest that these small molecules have a big impact on virus infection. From initial descriptions of polyamines in bacteriophage virions to the elucidation of the mechanism by which eIF5A hypusination enhances Ebola virus replication, the breadth of our knowledge of polyamine-virus infection continues to expand. Additional descriptive and mechanistic research will uncover as-yet-unidentified mechanisms of polyamine function in infection of bacteria, plants, and mammals. Despite their simplicity, the complexity of polyamines in cells and viruses will continue to present fascinating basic and translational scientific questions.",

ODC1 is inhibited through the action of ODC1 antizyme (OAZ1), which is inhibited by antizyme inhibitor (AZIN), in turn. Putrescine is converted to spermidine by spermidine synthase (SRM), and spermidine is further converted to spermine by spermine synthase (SMS). The conversion of spermine to spermidine releases hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the action of spermine oxidase (SMOX). Spermine and spermidine are acetylated by spermidine\u2013spermine acetyltransferase (SAT1) to form acetylated moieties (Ac-Spm and Ac-Spd). Acetylated spermidine or spermine can be converted to putrescine or spermidine, respectively, through the action of polyamine oxidase (PAOX).",

Polyamine synthesis consumes decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine (dcSAM), resulting in reduced nucleotide pools. These reduced nucleotide pools induce SAT1, which depletes polyamines, resulting in a feedback loop. The interconversion of polyamines via SMOX and PAOX accumulates reactive oxygen species, specifically hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Polyamines also are described to neutralize reactive oxygen species due to their abundance and charge. Additionally, polyamines maintain AMPK in its unphosphorylated, non-activated state to maintain lipid homeostasis. AMPK activation induces polyamine synthesis through c-myc mediated ODC1 induction.",
