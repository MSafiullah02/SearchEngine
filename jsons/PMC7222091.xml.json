Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) accounts for approximately 60% of malignant lymphomas and Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) accounts for the rest. The 2008 WHO classification defines the following major histological subtypes of NHL: precursor lymphoid neoplasm with subtypes including B-cell and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL and T-LBL); mature B-cell neoplasm with subtypes including Burkitt lymphoma (BL); diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); and mature T-cell and NK/T-cell neoplasms with subtypes including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) [1]. Compared with adult lymphomas, pediatric NHL more often presents as high-grade tumors with disseminated disease and distant metastasis [2].",

Event-free survival (EFS) rate for NHL has increased to 60\u201395% during the past 2 decades [3\u20136]. Recent studies have shown long-term EFS rates of over 80% in pediatric patients with HD [7]. These results have been achieved through collaboration study and risk stratification strategy [8, 9]. Previous studies have reported that an early response to chemotherapy is one of the prognostic markers of B-cell NHL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [10]. However, the prognosis for children with relapsed or refractory HD and NHL is poor with the current intensive regimens [11]. NKTL is a rare subtype of pediatric NHL and is known to have a highly aggressive clinical course. However, as data for pediatric NKTL are limited, no optimal treatment is available [12, 13]. High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) have been used to improve outcomes for lymphoma patients with poor prognosis. Therefore, we used HDC/auto-SCT in pediatric lymphoma patients who achieved partial response (PR) after induction chemotherapy, NKTL patients, and patients showing recurrence after conventional chemotherapy.",

Response evaluation was done using bone scan and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography was used since November 2009. A CR was defined as the total disappearance of all tumors and no evidence of disease; a PR was defined as a \u2265 50% decrease in tumor size and no new lesions; and progressive disease was defined as a \u2265 25% increase in tumor size or the appearance of a new lesion. A CR1 was defined as the CR achieved in a patient receiving first-line chemotherapy.

However, patients who received this total dose developed pulmonary toxicity; the crude incidence of drug-induced pneumonitis was 16% in our center. Richard et al. reported that the BCNU dose of 300 mg/m2 in BEC conditioning regimen was well tolerated and was not associated with any reduction in efficacy [15]. Lane et al. reported that pneumonitis is a significant cause of death in patients who received BCNU, and furthermore prior mediastinal radiation therapy is a risk factor of pneumonitis [46]. In our study, we did not find a relationship between pneumonitis and prior exposure to bleomycin or rituximab, or chest or craniospinal irradiation before HDC/auto-SCT because the number of patients in each group was small. The pathogenesis of BCNU pneumonitis has not yet been elucidated. As seen in this study, it is difficult to predict the development of BCNU pneumonitis based on the BCNU dose, prior mediastinal radiation therapy, and so on. BCNU pneumonitis tends to be self-limiting in most patients, but it is important to note that it may result in mortality in rare cases. Although it has been known that BCNU can cause pulmonary toxicity, there have been no previous reports of ACNU increasing the risk of pulmonary VOD as far as we know. However, more attention should be paid to pulmonary VOD when administering high-dose ACNU.",

Furthermore, novel treatment strategies are required to overcome poor outcomes in patients who show relapse after auto-SCT. Further studies and new strategies such as allogeneic SCT, upfront target therapy, and immunotherapy are needed to improve survival rates in high-risk lymphoma patients.",
