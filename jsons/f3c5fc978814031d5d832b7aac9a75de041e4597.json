Limited data is available of MxA in coinciding viral and bacterial infections. We investigated blood MxA levels in children hospitalized with a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) with or without simultaneous respiratory virus infection. We conducted a prospective observational study of 43 children hospitalized with febrile UTI. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected at admission and tested for 16 respiratory viruses by nucleic acid detection methods. Respiratory symptoms were recorded, and blood MxA levels were determined. The median age of study children was 4 months (interquartile range, 2-14 months). A respiratory virus was detected in 17 (40%) children with febrile UTI. Of the virus-positive children with febrile UTI, 7 (41%) had simultaneous respiratory symptoms. Blood MxA levels were higher in virus-positive children with respiratory symptoms (median, 778 [interquartile range, 535-2538] \u03bcg/L) compared to either virus-negative (155 [94-301] \u03bcg/L, P < 0.001) or virus-positive (171 [112-331] \u03bcg/L, P = 0.006) children without respiratory symptoms at presentation with febrile UTI.

Antiviral immune response of the host was demonstrated by elevated blood MxA protein level in all virus-positive children who had respiratory symptoms. Our results emphasize the high detection rate of respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR tests in nasopharyngeal samples of children with febrile UTI and show the potential of blood MxA protein as a biomarker of a symptomatic viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine symptoms of respiratory tract infection, respiratory viruses, and antiviral immune responses in children with febrile UTI. Earlier studies have investigated the risk of serious bacterial infection in febrile infants with or without respiratory virus infection. The presence of a respiratory virus infection has been reported to reduce the probability of UTI among febrile infants in comparison with virus-negative children [4, 5] , but there are differences between viruses in this regard. The risk of concomitant UTI in infants with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus infection, detected either by PCR or by an antigen test, is lower than the risk in virus-negative children [12] [13] [14] . On the contrary, in another study, the probability of UTI was not substantially lower in rhinovirus-positive compared with virus-negative infants [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1177, "end": 1180, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1183, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1446, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1451, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1456, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Multiplex respiratory virus PCR panels include viruses, which frequently cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections, such as rhinovirus or coronavirus, and viruses that persist in the airways, such as human bocavirus, and positive results for at least one virus are common also in healthy children [6, 7] .

Our results of frequent respiratory virus findings with or without respiratory symptoms in children with UTI support this view. As expected by its frequency in all young children [15] , rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus.

This is consistent with our previous study, in which we found higher baseline levels of blood MxA protein in children compared to adults but similar levels at ages 2 and 13 months [7] . It is important to consider the role of rotavirus or other live virus vaccinations in studies of MxA protein or other interferoninducible proteins in children, as live vaccines can increase blood MxA levels temporarily [7, 16] . However, recent rotavirus vaccination had only minor effect on blood MxA protein levels in the present study, similarly to our earlier observations [7] . We also earlier reported that febrile respiratory infections were associated with substantially higher blood MxA levels than infections without fever [7] .
