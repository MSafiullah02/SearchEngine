A similar hypothesis was stated by Baracchini et al. [6]. In addition, in our study we also observed a higher prevalence of SUSO patients with high NIHSS, who may have underestimated their own symptoms and thus delayed the alert. The increased number of SUSOs supports the adoption of a multimodal neuroimaging tissue-based approach (instead of time-based approach) to better define patients eligible to reperfusion therapy [7]. Considering \u2018code stroke\u2019 patients, the comparison of prehospital time response (from alert-to-admission) and intrahospital time response (door-to-treatment) showed no significant differences between 2020 and 2019 periods, suggesting the efficacy of the structured pathways adopted by our local health system to treat stroke patients during the COVID-19 emergency.",
