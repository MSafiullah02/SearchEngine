The ultimate source of all chemical elements is the rocks of the Earth: the outermost layer of the earth, called crust, supplies all nutrients. The process of weathering results in gradual breakdown and decomposition of the rock into its constituent minerals, and ultimately into various elements that are released into the environment to supply vital nutrients but sometimes harmful substances as well. This complex and slow geologic process depends on climate of the area, nature of the rock itself, and presence or absence of biota. As a general rule, rate of weathering is faster in warm and moist climatic regions with thriving biota, and slowest in cold regions with no or sparse biota. Additionally, natural geological processes, such as dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes, can release enormous quantities of mineral-laden dust, various toxic chemical elements and compounds, and coarse particles into the atmosphere resulting in poor and, often dangerous air quality.",

Geological materials and processes not only influence human health but also that of plants and animals; and in a broader context all the non-living components of the environment as well. Lately, a new term planetary health has been gaining currency, emphasizing that a healthy planet is essential for human health and well-being. Alarming degradation of the natural life-support systems-air water, biota, and soils during the past 200 years, the like of which has never occurred in the Earth's 4.6 billion-year history, has been the driving force behind the planetary health movement. Concerned by the degrading quality of earth's natural systems and its far-reaching consequences on human and ecosystem health, the emerging concept of planetary health emphasizes: . . .. . .\"human health and human civilization depend on flourishing natural systems and the wise stewardship of those natural systems\" (Whitmee et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "The importance of geologic materials, particularly minerals, as healing agents has been recognized since antiquity. Ancient Chinese and Indian people used minerals for healing as far back as 3000 BC. The Ayurvedic system of Indian medicine utilized minerals, such as cinnabar (HgS), galena (PbS), and realgar (As 4 S 4 ), along with chemical elements such as Au, Ag, Fe, and Zn, often combined with herbs, in medicinal preparations. An early Chinese pharmacopeia includes use of arsenolite (As 2 O 3 ), pearl (CaCO 3 ), and cinnabar (HgS) used for treatment of various ailments. The Assyrians and Babylonians are believed to have used alum KAl(SO 4 ) 2 . 12H 2 O, bitumen, and other natural materials for healing. Ancient Egyptians (1600 BC) used asphalt, copper, iron, lead, potassium nitrate (KNO 3 ), and sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) for medicinal purposes. Greeks and Mayans are also known to have used many minerals in medical prescriptions, about 400 BC and 800 AD, respectively. Islamic medicine flourished between the 8th and 14th centuries. Several Arab scholars made valuable contributions to medicine, notably Rhazes (865-925), Abulcasis (936-1013), and Avicenna (980-1037). Rhazes (Arabic name: Ab ubakr Mohammad Zakariyy a R az \u0131 ), was an alchemist, physician, and philosopher from Rayy near Tehran in modern-day Iran. His most famous work, Kitab al-Hawi fi al-Tibb (The Comprehensive Book of Medicine), running into 23 volumes, was translated into Latin in the 13th century. The Latin translation entitled Liber Continens, and its first edition, published in Brescia, Italy, in 1486, is the largest and heaviest book printed before 1501. In it, Rhazes described many medicinal formulations using geological materials, such as alum, saltpeter, gold, and mercury for treatment of various medical conditions. Abulcasis (Ab u al-Q asim in Arabic), a distinguished Arab physician, lived near Cordoba in Spain. His famous 30-volume work, Kitab al-Tasrif, covers a broad range of medical topics, with the 28th volume addressing pharmacy and pharmaceutical techniques. It provides recipes and explains how to prepare the \"simples\" (individual plants, minerals or animal products) for compounding complex drugs in the form of ointments, syrup, powder, or tablets. In the 11th century the great Arab physician Avicenna (Ibn Sina), wrote two famous books: Kitab al-Shifa (Book of Healing) and Qanun-fi-Tibb (Canon of Medicine). The latter was translated into Latin in the 12th century and served as an authoritative text in European medical schools until the 17th century. The 5-volume book on healing-Canon of Medicine-emphasized the influence of environmental factors of humidity and temperature on physical ailments. Volume II of the book contains a list of 760 drugs derived from plants, chemical elements, and minerals for treatment of various diseases and, in Volume IV, Avicenna outlined his contagion theory and mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath and discussed the spread of disease through water and soil (Byrne, 2012) . A detailed account of ancient insights into geology and health is available in Hasan et al. (2013) .",

An educated person with basic understanding of natural healing substances, such as plants and minerals, could become a physician. In fact, physicians in Europe until the late 18th century were \"learned gentlemen\" who had acquired effective practical skills to practice medicine. Although the first medical schools in the United States were founded in the 1760s, most doctors were practicing medicine following a 3-4 years apprenticeship with a reputed physician (Custers and Cate, 2018) . Prior college education for admission into a medical school became a requirement in Europe during the last decade of the 19th century. In the United States too, until the mid-19th century, formal education at a college was not required and an extended apprenticeship was all the medical education one needed to practice medicine. In 1895, the Chicago Medical School (now part of the Northwestern University) made college education a requirement for admission into its medical school. Later, in 1898, Johns Hopkins University required all medical school applicants to have a bachelor's degree. Harvard University in 1901 also required a college degree for medical school admission. Medical geology represents a re-emergence of a vocation that engaged the medical practitioners from the 17th until the mid-19th century. As was common in this period, medical education required theoretical studies comprising Latin and three main disciplines: religion, law, and natural science, the later included philosophy, geology, mineralogy, and botany. Many physicians found geology intellectually more stimulating and shifted their interest and career into the field of geology to become famous geologists. A partial list of famous geologists who were initially trained as physicians is presented in Table 1 .",

But it did not find favor because geomedicine connotes a subspecialty of medicine, such as family medicine, nuclear medicine, etc. So, the term medical geology, first mentioned in 1834 by an anonymous British physician (see quotation above), was officially adopted about 163 years later in 1997 at a meeting of the medical geology working group at the 4th International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry held at Vail, Colorado, United States. Professor O. Selinus, as a member of The Commission on Geological Sciences Table 1 Famous geologists trained as physicians. for Environmental Planning (COGEOENVIRONMENT) of the International Union of Geosciences (IUGS), had earlier (in 1996) suggested the idea of forming a working group on medical geology. IUGS accepted the proposal and appointed Selinus chair of the working group. The working group at Vail officially adopted the title Medical Geology at a meeting with several geoscientists, public health professionals, and medical scientists. It was fully agreed that the term geomedicine was not the appropriate name to describe this discipline as the name was not considered by the medical and public health communities to be applicable and relevant to their profession (Selinus, 2019 (Selinus, , 2020 .",

It covers a wide range of chemical, biological, and physical environments at scales extending from the microscopic (e.g., involving studies of individual microbes or chemicals in tissue samples) to global (e.g., examining the provenance of atmosphere-borne particulate materials and pathogens transported by intercontinental dust storms). Challenging and exciting new areas are unfolding every day, offering infinite opportunities for medical geologists to make valuable contributions for safeguarding human and ecological health. For example, control of geologic factors on (i) the prevalence of cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease, neurological disorders from imbalance of trace elements; (ii) antibiotic properties of clay minerals; (iii) lithium levels in drinking water and tendency for suicide; (iv) surveillance and mitigation of zoonotic and other diseases triggered by climate change; and (v) control of pollution related mortality and morbidity. An expanding role for medical geologists in effective management of global health is also envisioned in multidisciplinary teams and committees charged with information dissemination, citizen science, public education, and policy making.",

Hazardous geological processes, such as floods, landslides, earthquakes and volcanic activities mobilize chemical elements and compounds into the environment that can produce both beneficial and harmful impacts on all life forms. Geology, in other words, plays a key role in health and wellbeing of humans, plants, and animals. All naturally-occurring chemical elements are derived from rocks. The topmost layer of the Earth, called crust, is a relatively thin (5-40 km) layer of rigid, brittle rocks that is exposed to the atmosphere. Depending on the location at the Earth's surface and climate, rocks of the crust are being continuously subjected to a series of complex physical, chemical and biochemical reactions termed weathering. This interaction results in breakdown of rocks into discrete mineral grains, with accompanying release of various elements and compounds into the environment. Geologic processes involving action of wind, water, and ice carry the elements and compounds released during the weathering process from one location to the other. The processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition result in accumulation of geologic materials at a new location. It also results in excess or deficiency of chemical elements and compounds at various locations on the Earth, both of which are critical from a health perspective (see section \"Chemical Elements and Health\" for details).",

These acidic materials brought large scale destruction, including 10,000 deaths resulting from the \"haze famine\" caused by the persistent presence of toxic acids that caused large-scale damage to crops, and massive livestock loss, wiping out 50% of all island cattle and horses, and 80% of the sheep.

Fine particles can remain suspended in the air for considerable period of time to enter into living organisms, including humans, through inhalation and/or ingestion. Cases of physical injuries and deaths associated with earthquakes have been widely reported, but health problems are also caused by inhalation of dust. An interesting example is the high incidence of coccidioidomycosis (or valley fever) following the 17th January 1994, M 6.7 Northridge earthquake in southern California. The major and after-shocks triggered over 11,000 landslides that whipped up the soil and caused the arthrospores to be plucked and attach to fine dust. The prevailing northwesterly winds dispersed large dust clouds into nearby valleys. Inhalation of dust carrying the spores Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii of the fungus Coccidioides resulted in a higher incidence of coccidioidomycosis in Simi valley in Ventura County. Between January 24 and March 15, 1994, 203 outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis cases, including three fatalities, were reported in the area (Schneider, et al., 1997) .",

However, recent studies have shown that the high cation exchange capacity of certain clay minerals, such as montmorillonite, that is known to take up harmful toxic heavy metal ions (e.g., As, Hg), may account for use of montmorillonite-rich samples of terra sigillata as an antidote for poisoning.

This principle relies on the finding that all chemicals, even water and life-supporting oxygen, can be toxic if too much is consumed. Trace elements provide best example to illustrate this maxim. For a long time, the response to toxic substances on living organisms was studied in the laboratory on test animals, typically mice, and rabbits, but other species such as minnows, and even monkeys, have also been used to determine the optimum doses of chemicals. This is a very slow, inhumane, and extremely expensive process that has deterred testing of thousands of chemicals that are in everyday use. However, recent advances in robotics technology aided by high power computation led to the establishment of Tox21, in 2008, a collaborative program between three U.S. federal agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the Food and Drug Administration.

During this time, the capability to probe, detect, and analyze almost any material to a high level of precision took a quantum leap forward. Sophisticated analytical equipment, supported by powerful computers enables the analysis of geological materials rapidly at a high level of precision and accuracy. Detection of chemical elements and compounds in environmental samples to sub-ppm levels has become routine procedure in modern analytical laboratories. This development has led to an enhanced interest in understanding the geochemistry of the natural environment and initiation of ambitious projects to prepare geochemical atlases at local, state, regional, and national levels in the European Union, the United States, China, and many other countries. These geochemical surveys that commenced in the 1960s are still continuing. Information on occurrence, distribution, and concentration of chemical elements in soil, sediment, water, and plants has been used for a variety of applications, such as agriculture, environmental pollution, fisheries, medicine, public health, water supply, wildlife nutrition, and other areas (Thornton, 1993) . The pioneering work done by the national geological surveys of Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States on the influence of trace elements on health between the 1960s and 1980s laid the foundation for focused studies on the relationship between geological materials and processes on human health. It should be noted that similar studies on animals and plants had been carried out much earlier by animal and plant scientists, who investigated the association of essential and trace elements on diseases in animals and plants. Despite the numerous studies linking chemical elements and compounds on occurrence of disease in human beings, such studies remained as isolated investigations in geochemistry and epidemiology. However, an interdisciplinary symposium held in Montreal, Canada, at the 1964 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), organized by its Geology and Geography sections, and the Geochemical Society, provided a major impetus for recognizing the importance of geological factors in human health. The landmark publication Environmental Geochemistry in Health and Disease (Cannon and Hopps, 1971 ) by the Geological Society of America was seminal in this context. At the same time, various initiatives in Europe by the British, Finnish, and Swedish geological surveys served as the needed catalyst for establishment of a new subspecialty within the earth sciences.",

In all, 25 annual conferences were held, covering a variety of topics on the role of trace substances in human and ecological health. Its proceedings volume contains a wealth of information on trace substances and their impact on human and ecological health. The Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health (SEGH) that was formed in Dallas, Texas in December 1968 at the symposium on \"Environmental Geochemistry in Health and Disease\" collaborated with the ETSC and held its first annual meeting in 1970 during the \"3rd Annual Conference on Trace Substances in Environmental Health\" at UMC. SEGH continued to hold its annual meetings at UMC until 1993 when the ETSC closed and the conference series ended. The symbiotic relation between these two organizations attracted all well-known researchers in the field from the world over, and the conference proceedings still serve as a valuable resource to students and professionals alike. Many of the SEGH members and officers served on the U.S. National Research Academy's Subcommittee on the Geochemical Environment in Relation to Health and Disease created under the U.S. National Committee for Geochemistry, a Division of Earth Sciences of the National Research Council, when it was established in 1969. The subcommittee published three reports on Geochemistry and the Environment in 1972, '73, and '74 and other valuable documents that included reports on: (i) the geochemistry of water in relation to cardiovascular disease, (ii) the trace-element geochemistry of coal resources development related to environmental quality and health, (iii) aging and the geochemical environment, and (iv) geochemical environment and urolithiasis (kidney stones), all topics highly relevant to medical geology.

However, like all other trace elements, the beneficial aspect of fluorine is limited to a narrow range of concentration in the ingested food or water. Above this optimum range, fluorine becomes harmful and produces adverse effects on teeth and bones; similarly, its complete absence or concentration lower than the optimum is also harmful. Fig. 4 shows the dose-response curve for fluoride. In the United States, standards for fluoridation of drinking water have been controversial and, due to the vested interests of industry and political pressures, standards have been revised at least three times: In 1975, under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the acceptable range of fluoride was set between 1.4 and 2.4 ppm. The Environmental Protection Agency revised the standard in 1985 and set the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for fluoride at 4 ppm, meaning that as long as the concentration remained below 4 ppm it would cause no harm. Most recently, in 2015, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services revised the safe range from 0.7 to 1.2 ppm. By contrast, the guideline of 0.5 to 1.5 ppm fluoride in drinking water set by WHO in 1984 was twice reviewed in 1993 and 2004, but without any change in the guidelines.",

As reported by Hasan et al. (2013) , one of the reasons for General Custer's defeat might be selenium poisoning of his cavalry horses and mules. The animals grazed for months on native legume Astragalus bisulcatus, which is known to be a selenium accumulating plant. This legume was in full bloom during the spring, at their most succulent and Se-enriched state when the animals grazed on them. Ingestion of high amounts of selenium resulted in Se toxicity in the animals making them weak, partially paralyzed, suffering from impaired vision, and locosis, which made them unfit to serve in the battle. In both cases, a local geochemical anomaly was responsible for the animals' sickness. Excessive ingestion of selenium also leads to an acute toxic effect, called blind staggers, causing near blindness, and other nervous system diseases.",
