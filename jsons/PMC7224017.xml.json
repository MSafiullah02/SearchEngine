Briefly, this novel ETT is double-cuffed and equipped with a supplemental port in the space between the cuffs (Fig. 1). ETT and cuffs are made of polyvinylchloride. Both cuffs are cylindrical and have a high volume\u2013low pressure design. A positive pressure, created and regulated by an external source, is continuously presented to the intercuff space (ICS) and propels secretions upwards towards the oropharynx. We previously demonstrated superiority of this ETT above currently commercialized ETTs in preventing leakage of secretions in a vertical syringe model and in an artificial trachea [4].

Cuff pressures were permanently kept at 25 cmH2O by an automated digital cuff pressure manometer (VBN cuff controller, VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz am Neckar, Germany). An external device (Respironics REMstar, Phillips, Herrsching, Germany) delivered CPAP to the ICS via the port in-between cuffs. The flow generated by the CPAP source was continuously measured (Mass Flow Meter 4040, TSI, Minnesota, USA). Ventilator settings were not changed during the study. At zero flow, ICS pressure equalled the working pressure (16 cmH2O) of the external CPAP device. An increase in flow was associated with lower ICS pressure due to resistance at the entrance of the flow conduit into the tube. When ICS pressure exceeded working pressure, air flow reversed and left the circuit through the CPAP device. Overall, ICS pressures were maintained between 10 and 15 cmH2O.",

            "text": "The presence of an ETT increases susceptibility to VAP because bacteriologically contaminated secretions leak around an inflated ETT cuff [5] and/or biofilms infested with bacteria are formed inside the ETT [6]. In addition, patient disconnection from the ventilator, either accidentally or preparing extubation, or cuff deflation may cause inflow of secretions. Measures to avoid leakage and aspiration include the use of specific cuff materials (e.g., polyurethane), cuff shapes (e.g., conical), continuous automatic maintenance of cuff pressure, and ETTs equipped with a suction lumen for aspiration of subglottic secretions [7]. Silver-coated ETTs may limit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the lumen of the ETT [8]. Comparative trials assessing these specifically designed ETTs have shown a decreased aspiration risk, a lower VAP incidence, a decreased ventilation time and a delay in VAP onset [9-11] but no effect on duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, or hospital stay [12, 13]. A main issue is that, regardless of the type of inflow prevention incorporated in an ETT, some leakage still occurs along the cuff folds [14]. Moreover, important safety concerns remain. Subglottic suctioning may cause pharyngeal and laryngeal injury [15] and condensation in polyurethane-cuffed ETTs leads to erratic manometric cuff pressure readings [16].",

Hwang et al. designed a double-cuffed tracheal tube similar to ours but filled the intercuff space with a water-soluble gel. Applying this interrupting gel layer prevented fluid leakage for 48 h in a bench-top model [19]. This ETT was never tested in vivo because prolonged exposure to the gel components might harm the tracheal mucosa. In a later study, the same investigators connected a pressure system to the intercuff port. Application of appropriate negative suction pressures in the intercuff space completely inhibited saline leakage past the cuffs [20].

Second, occurrence of VAP is tightly correlated with bacterial load. Methylene blue as marker of leakage does not allow quantitative evaluation of microaspiration. Other markers (e.g., pepsin or amylase) present in tracheal secretions can overcome this limitation in a clinical setting [21]. Third, the sealing efficacy of the ETT was studied for only 24 h.

During controlled ventilation, ICS pressure rises with peak inspiratory pressure and CPAP flow decreases. During (PEEP-supported) expiration, ICS pressure decreases and CPAP flow increases accordingly. During spontaneous breathing (sustained by a pressure support up to 5 cmH2O), inspiration draws air from the ICS. The resulting decrease in ICS pressure is promptly restored by an increase in CPAP flow. Expiration produces the opposite effect. At pressure support levels above 5 cmH2O, pressures and CPAP flow follow the same pattern as in controlled ventilation",
