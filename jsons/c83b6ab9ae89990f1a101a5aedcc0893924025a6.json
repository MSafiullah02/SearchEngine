            "text": "Over the past several years, acute and fatal respiratory illnesses have occurred in the habituated group of wild chimpanzees at the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Common respiratory viruses, such as measles and influenza, have been considered possible causative agents; however, neither of these viruses had been detected. During the fatal respiratory illnesses in 2003, 2005 and 2006, regular observations on affected individuals were recorded. Cause-specific morbidity rates were 98.3, 52.4 and 33.8%, respectively. Mortality rates were 6.9, 3.2 and 4.6%; all deaths were observed in infants 2 months-2 years 9 months of age. Nine other chimpanzees have not been seen since the 2006 outbreak and are presumed dead; hence, morbidity and mortality rates for 2006 may be as high as 47.7 and 18.5%, respectively. During the 2005 and 2006 outbreaks, 12 fecal samples were collected from affected and nonaffected chimpanzees and analyzed for causative agents. Analysis of fecal samples from 2005 suggests the presence of paramyxovirus, and in 2006 a human-related metapneumovirus was detected and identified in an affected chimpanzee whose infant died during the outbreak. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the causative agent associated with these illnesses is viral and contagious, possibly of human origin; and that, possibly more than one agent may be circulating in the population. We recommend that baseline health data be acquired and food wadge and fecal samples be obtained and bio-banked as early as possible when attempting to habituate new groups of chimpanzees or other great apes. For already habituated populations, disease prevention strategies, ongoing health monitoring programs and reports of diagnostic findings should be an integral part of managing these populations. In addition, descriptive epidemiology should be a major component of disease outbreak investigations. Am.",

For example, the prototype respiratory syncytial virus (''chimpanzee coryza virus'') was isolated from a young captive chimpanzee in 1956 and antigenically similar human isolates were described subsequently, and signs of upper respiratory tract infections in chimpanzees have been associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [Beem et al., 1960; Belshe et al., 1977; Clarke et al., 1994; Morris et al., 1956] . Captive-bred chimpanzees have been found to be seropositive for one or both strains (CAN75 and CAN83) of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [Skiadopoulos et al., 2004] . RSV and hMPV are common human respiratory pathogens found globally and are capable of causing upper and lower respiratory diseases. Using molecular methods, RSV, hMPV and other bacterial respiratory pathogens have now been detected in lung tissue taken from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) that died in association with respiratory outbreaks in Ta\u00ef Forest National Park, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire [Chi et al., 2007; K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008] . Our studies indicate that the presence of human-related paramyxoviruses in habituated wild chimpanzees in the Ta\u00ef Forest is not a regionally based occurrence or the result of isolated events. We show that a humanrelated paramyxovirus is also present and associated with acute and fatal respiratory illnesses in the habituated population of chimpanzees at Mahale Mountains National Park (MMNP).",

Beginning in October 1965, habituation efforts were initiated by researchers from Japan to attract chimpanzees from two unitgroups, referred to as the K and the M-Groups, allowing human observers to approach them in their natural habitat [Nishida, 1990] . Chimpanzee viewing has attracted tourists from around the world since Mahale became a Park in 1985 and tourism has steadily increased [Nishida & Mwinuka, 2005] . People have been observed viewing Mahale chimpanzees as close 1-2 m and chimpanzees do approach, and in some cases, even make direct contact with observers [T. Kaur & J. Singh, personal observations] . The M-Group, once comprised of as many as 101 individuals in 1984, is now estimated to contain only 63 individuals, including 15 chimpanzees who immigrated into the M-Group since 1981 [Nishida et al., 2003] . Since the 1990s, signs of respiratory illnesses have been observed in the M-Group chimpanzees [Hanamura et al., 2008; Hosaka, 1995; Kaur & Huffman, 2004] . Although no interference with normal behavior is allowed and only noninvasive sample collection is permitted for research purposes, a long-term health program has recently been established to monitor their health and well-being.",

One chimpanzee was a healthy adolescent female (10 years old) with no overt signs of respiratory disease, and the other was her mother, a 45-year-old adult female carrying her infant. Both the older adult and her infant were coughing severely and appeared to be weak. On July 15th, the sick adult female was again observed coughing and weak and carrying her now dead infant. On the following day, the independent adolescent female, still in good health, was again observed traveling with the older adult chimpanzee whose health was apparently improving. Three samples were collected from the healthy adolescent female, and the other two fecal samples were collected from the older adult female with noticeable signs of respiratory disease. The samples were taken from the forest floor immediately after the chimpanzees were observed defecating and stored frozen at \u00c0201C after several hours.

Samples were first tested individually by each of the four pan viral family PCR assays using the Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR kit and the Invitrogen Taq polymerase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The PCR mixtures contained 50 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, 1 \u00c2 buffer with final concentration of 2.0 mM MgSO 4 and 200 mM each of dNTP, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, a 5 ml aliquot of RNA/DNA extracts and 1 unit of SuperScript III RT/ Platinum Taq Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

As shown in the phylogenetic trees in Figure 3 , the partial N and G gene sequences of recent hMPV strains showed that the chimpanzee isolate clustered into group A with the highest sequence identity to hMPV JPS03 194 strain (99% in N and 99% in G) . Five nucleic acid mutations were observed in the 839 bp N gene amplicon of the chimpanzee MPV relative to the hMPV JPS03 194 strain (all transitions and synonymous changes).

All three outbreaks occurred during the dry season (June through September) which coincides with the peak tourist season at MMNP. In the 2003 outbreak, 98.3% of the M-Group chimpanzees were observed with signs of respiratory tract infection and morbidity decreased in subsequent outbreak years. Although there were earlier reports by Hosaka of respiratory outbreaks, the trend as shown in Figure 1 for 2003, 2005 and 2006 suggests that, if the same causative agent was responsible for illness in more than one outbreak year it was probably introduced from humans in 2003.

For example, if females are carriers and emigrate to neighboring groups they may introduce the disease to other nonhabituated chimpanzees groups. In regard to the chimpanzees that were not observed with signs but have not been seen since the 2006 outbreak, if they were infected with the pathogen and did not succumb to the illness, it is possible, although unlikely that they have emigrated to a different Group and may be exposing other (nonhabituated) chimpanzee groups in and around MMNP. At this stage regardless of how careful humans are now to prevent transmission of the causative agent(s), the damage is likely already done. Nevertheless, all possible precautions should be taken and policies enforced to prevent introduction of this and other pathogens. (whether or not the two late cases were associated with the outbreak is unknown. However, signs were still persisting in a few chimpanzees including the mother of the infant observed with signs on September 6; hence, these two late cases are considered a part of this outbreak, although exposed or first observed later than most cases) and 2006.

Clinical signs of respiratory illness were observed in all age groups of the M-Group chimpanzees consistent with those reported in humans infected with hMPV. In addition, like humans, chimpanzees under the age of 3 years were more severely affected than other age groups. Using real-time RT-PCR, RNA from the pneumovirus RSV-the most closely related human pathogen to hMPV-has been detected in feces, nasal secretions, saliva and sweat samples, whereas, hMPV RNA has been detected in nasal secretions, saliva and sweat samples, but not in feces [von Linstow et al., 2006] . Here, we report that the human-related MPV particles can be detected by TEM, as well as PCR in feces from infected chimpanzees.

Molecular characterization of the strains by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, RT-PCR and nested PCR was attempted and all gave negative results; therefore, whether the rotavirus is of simian or human origin is not known. These negative molecular results agree with those of a recent study in which rotavirus was detected only by EIA but not by molecular techniques [Wang et al., 2007] . That study demonstrated that rotavirus was unstable and appeared atypical in stools of nonhuman primates with diarrhea, an observation contrary to general belief by many people. As rotavirus is ubiquitous and neither of the two chimpanzees reported to have diarrhea were tested for rotavirus, whether a co-infection with rotavirus may have played a role in the fatal respiratory outbreaks is not known. In the studies conducted by von Linstow et al., RSV was found in five fecal samples taken from five different children; four of the children had diarrhea [von Linstow et al., 2006] . We speculate that the presence of rotavirus in the chimpanzees may alter transient time through the digestive tract or gastrointestinal function and thereby facilitate the passing of intact virus particles. Whether or not the virions of hrcMPV excreted in the feces are infectious and constitute a potential mode of transmission is not yet known, however, live avian MPV is known to be shed in the feces of nonvaccinated hens [Hess et al., 2004] .",

As shown in Figure 3 , the hrcMPV strain detected in Mahale chimpanzees is closest to the Japanese strain JPS03 194 (99% in N and 99% in G genes), whereas, the hMPV P genes isolated from the three Ta\u00ef Forest chimpanzees are closest to the CAN98 75 strain. There is $94% identity between CAN98 75 N gene and JPS03 194 N gene. Data on the closely related virus, RSV, would argue against making any claims about the source of hrcMPV. There is much more data on RSV and it demonstrates that similar or identical strains (based on similar amount of sequence data) can be isolated from different countries and continents during the same year, as well as over many years. This probably reflects the extent of global travel as well as the stability of some strains over time, which is interesting given the lack of fidelity of RNA virus replication. In order to draw any conclusions regarding the possible source(s) of hMPV in habituated wild chimpanzee populations, virus-laden samples would need to be sequenced from park staff, researchers, tourists, tourist guides and local villagers. In addition, sequence data from many parts of the world would be required in order to establish local and global distributions of the different strains of hMPV.",

            "text": "Finding human-related paramyxoviruses, like RSV and hrcMPV, in habituated chimpanzee populations is not unforeseen. For the past quarter of a century, humans have been gradually coming into closer proximity with great apes populations. There are many examples of possible transmissions of parasites, protozoa, bacteria and even viruses to habituated great ape populations. In Beni, Zaire and at Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, poliovirus transmission from humans to chimpanzees was suspected and several chimpanzees died and others developed limb paresis or paralysis [Goodall, 1986; Kortlandt, 1996] . Transmission to gorillas of Sarcoptes scabiei and Giardia duodenalis in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and measles virus in Parc National des Volcans, Rwanda have been reported [Ferber, 2000; Graczyk et al., 2001 Graczyk et al., , 2002 Salzer et al., 2007; Sholley, 1989] . At Kibale National Park in Uganda, Escherichia coli isolates in the feces of habituated chimpanzees were found to be genetically more similar to isolates from the feces of humans employed in research and tourism than those obtained from humans in a local village who had no regular interactions with them [Goldberg et al., 2007] . This suggests that, globalization and ease and expediency of international air travel, may be increasing the risk of introducing infectious agents into these once remote and inaccessible areas, thereby increasing the risk to habituated great apes in their natural habitats. There is mounting concern now given that great ape populations are diminishing and it is becoming more difficult for these species to recover. Furthermore, in the case of RSV and hMPV, as safe and effective vaccines are not even available, the risk of introduction to habituated great ape populations far exceeds that of other human pathogens where immunization is possible.",

            "text": "With increasing reports on cross-species transmissions between great apes and humans, infectious disease surveillance of great ape populations and other wildlife populations along equatorial Africa are of great significance to both public health and great ape survival. Practices need to be put into place and enforced to prevent new introductions of pathogens from humans. The following recommendations are being made based on the limited amount of information available at this time, and knowing full well that these recommendations are subject to change as studies progress. signs of respiratory illness visit the forest for chimpanzee viewing. Mucous discharge from the nose or oral cavity of humans should never be discharged into the forest; use of tissue paper or handkerchiefs should be encouraged. 3. Proper disposal of human waste generated in the Park should be mandatory to help reduce the risk of pathogen transmission to chimpanzees, especially as chimpanzees are known to come into close proximity to the tourist camps and research camps. 4. Occupational health programs should be established and maintained over the long term and include Park staff, researchers (faculty, staff and students), trackers and guides. The program should include everyone who regularly or frequently observes the chimpanzees and include vaccinations, TB testing and continuing education and training. 5. An educational program should be instituted so local villagers who may come to work in the Park are better informed about the Park being an important National resource. It should highlight why the animals in the Park and Park conditions need to be well maintained. It is crucial that the know-how to prevent and tackle infectious diseases be woven into the local community members so they are rooted in place for the long term. A tourist educational program would also be a good addition to the chimpanzee-viewing program. 6. Routine monitoring for infectious diseases and timely reporting of findings should be ongoing for habituated wild populations. Standardized formats for data collection should be used to facilitate analysis. All chimpanzees observed having respiratory signs should be reported immediately to a designated party responsible for follow-up. Interventions, such as vaccinations (if available), should be considered to mitigate the effects of pathogens of human origin that have been or may be introduced into a habituated population. 7. Habituation of new groups, when necessary, should be conducted taking all possible precautions. Surveillance should be conducted on nonhabituated groups whenever possible, as exposures may have already occurred from humans or have spread from habituated groups. Baseline health data should be acquired and food wadge and fecal samples be obtained and banked as early as possible when attempting to habituate new groups of chimpanzees to document prehabituation status and determine changes. 8. Old policies, as well as any new policies, should be updated, combined into a single document and re-distributed yearly, just before the onset of peak tourist season, to all contingencies viewing chimpanzees (researchers, tourists and Park staff). Policies need to be enforced.",
