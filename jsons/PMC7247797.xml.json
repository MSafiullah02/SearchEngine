We did a case-note review of recipients of PEPSE in two 4 week periods (appendix). A 4 week period before lockdown (Jan 20, 2020, to Feb 16, 2020) was chosen as a comparison because this period was immediately before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began in the UK but was close enough to the date of the lockdown to minimise potential seasonal variability. Compared with this 4 week period before lockdown, there were more than 80% fewer PEPSE prescriptions in the first 4 weeks of the lockdown, from March 23, 2020, to April 19, 2020 (161 vs 28 prescriptions). In both periods, the majority of prescriptions were given to men and most PEPSE was given for unprotected, receptive anal intercourse. The median age of those receiving prescriptions was 32 years (IQR 27\u201339) in the pre-lockdown period and 32 years (26\u201345) for the period in lockdown. There was no difference in the amount of prescriptions given to individuals because of group sex between the two periods. However, HIV exposures were more likely to involve sex facilitated by recreational drug use with methamphetamine, mephedrone, ketamine, or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (known as chemsex) and sex facilitated by the injection of these substances (known as slamsex) in lockdown than before lockdown.",
