Applying a dose modulation function in which the system samples the patient thickness and adjusts (e.g., reduces) the exposure accordingly when the tube is in the AP/PA position, as patients are narrower in AP than in the side-to-side orientation. 2. Reduction of the kilovoltage to 100 kVp when imaging the thorax. Further reduction to 80 kVp is possible for CT angiography (CTA), but as resolution of the parenchyma is not ideal this is applied only if lung pathology is unlikely. 3.

Unlike the single-slice scanner, an increase or decrease in table-feed time for MDCT scanners only affects the overall scanning time. An increase in table speed results in a concomitant increase in mA, which has no effect on the dose delivered.

            "text": "Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis occurs in approximately one-third of infected children. It makes up part of the diffuse infiltrate lymphocytosis syndrome and is thought to represent a direct 'hyperimmune' lung response to the presence of either HIV or Epstein-Barr virus. The disease appears to be restricted to those children expressing HLA DR 5 alleles and is associated with a slower rate of AIDS progression. Radiographic appearances include interstitial reticulonodular infiltrates that may progress to patchy air-space consolidation. In contrast to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, lymphadenopathy is common and often becomes more prominent during episodes of super-added infection.",

The infecting viruses include RSV, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, CMV, and occasionally measles. Children infected with VZV often present with a more protracted illness than seen in immunocompetent children, and approximately 50% suffer from chronic or recurrent VZV infection. The risk of complications increases with increasing immunological impairment. The mortality rate in children with AIDS is 15%. The chest radiograph in VZV pneumonia patients typically shows evidence of bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates. The nodules are range in size from 3 to 10 mm; they often coalesce, resulting in focal areas of consolidation. Superimposed bacterial infection is common.",

Disseminated or extrapulmonary tuberculosis is classified as an AIDS indicator in children. The radiological features are usually similar to those in immunocompetent controls and include lobar consolidation, segmental or lobar atelectasis, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary cavitation is uncommon. Large-volume lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding, the paratracheal and hilar regions being the most common sites.",

Sadly, tuberculosis has returned to challenge us and the radiologist must keep this in mind when analyzing radiographs that show abundant lymphadenopathy, or consolidation that does not resolve with conventional anti-microbial therapy. A respiratory presentation is the most common initial manifestation of immunodeficiency states in children, with infectious complications being the most common. There is overlap in the radiological findings, and correlation with the cause and severity of the underlying immunodeficiency state is important when interpreting imaging findings.",
