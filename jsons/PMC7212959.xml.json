In a letter dated 27th March 2020, the French General Health Directorate (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9 - DGS) referred the matter to the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9; HAS), with a view to drawing up general recommendations designed to ensure continuity of care for pregnant women during lockdown and travel restrictions. Given the very limited data available, the French High Council for Public Health (Haut Conseil de Sant\u00e9 Publique \u2212 HCSP) considered pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy to be at risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 [1]. The extension of lockdown and the role and workload of healthcare professionals, lead to re-interviewing organizations for the follow-up of pregnant women in terms of prevention and care. These rapid responses focus on the follow-up of pregnant women during lockdown and management of cases of suspected and/or confirmed pregnant women with COVID-19. They should be adapted according to the geographical particularities of the epidemic outbreak and access to local resources. These rapid responses are based on the knowledge available at the time of publication and are subject to change as new information becomes available.",
