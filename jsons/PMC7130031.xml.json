In order to enroll a random sample of the general pet cat population, we needed to contact a random sample of cat owners in Sydney.

Other recent surveys of animal owners using a similar approach but using targeted sampling frames (eg, client lists of equine veterinary practices; owner list of a dog kennel club) achieved response rates of 50.1\u201365.7% with return to sender losses of 7.2\u201321.8%.22, 23, 24 The low return to sender loss of 7.2% achieved by Hotchkiss et al24 is likely due to mailing software used to verify horse owner addresses supplied by veterinary clinics prior to first posting. This study, in contrast, despite considerable effort taken with questionnaire design and administration, achieved a lower response rate due to use of a non-targeted sampling frame and the lower priority questionnaire return for ordinary households compared to horse or pedigree dog-owning households. However, given the study objective, use of a non-targeted sampling frame in this study was essential to ensure representation of all types of pet cat-owning households, and for future work, the response rate achieved clearly demonstrated that a general survey will obtain fewer responses than a targeted survey.",

Likewise, households using a mobile phone exclusively or using broad band internet telephony would not have been sampled, possibly underestimating certain demographic groups. In addition, we are aware that some envelopes returned due to insufficient address details belonged to households living in large apartment complexes that could not be delivered due to lack of the apartment number. With the benefit of hindsight, we may have been better served by using randomly selected entries from the electoral rolls, as data on the specific residential address and the exact postcode were more complete than in the phone book.

A survey of pet ownership in Perth25 found quite similar findings, with 34.1% of households owning a dog, 28.6% owning a cat, with both dog(s) and cat(s) being owned by 5.6% of households. Our data are in general agreement with the predicted decline in the percentage of cat-owning households reported for Australia as a whole (from 31% to 26% over the period 1994\u20131999).3 It is not possible to say whether the further decline in cat ownership in Sydney (to 23% in 2006) is a real phenomenon reflecting the trend demonstrated previously, or attributable to a difference between cats in the Sydney region compared to cats recruited from around the whole country. The former seems more likely, given that industry data continues to indicate the Australian cat population is in decline, with estimates in the popular press suggesting the current owned cat population to be 2.1 million. The continuing decrease in the number of pet cats in Australia contrasts with the increasing popularity of the cat as a companion animal in North America and the UK, where it has superseded the dog in most recent surveys.26 Indeed, in the USA, the compound annual increase in the cat population is said to be somewhere between 1.2 and 1.9%,6, 26 while the figure in the UK is 1.9% (Magnosi 1999; cited by Ref. 3). The lack of duplication of this trend in Australia, despite lifestyle changes which make cat ownership arguably more rational than dog ownership (as cats have greater independence; less requirement for exercise; less food, boarding and veterinary expenses, etc.), re-emphasises issues raised previously by Baldock et al.3\n",

            "text": "As expected, the majority of cat owners fed a heterogeneous diet consisting of dry and canned food (38.1%) or commercial (dry and/or canned) food and fresh meat (41.8%) to their cats. Only 1.6% of households fed fresh meat alone, providing a potential explanation why thiamine deficiency is so rare in clinical practice despite the widespread use of sulphite preservatives in kangaroo meat designated for consumption by pets.27 This is because diets containing constituents other than \u2018pet meat\u2019 typically contain sufficient thiamine to prevent development of a deficiency state, especially if the other foods are fed at a different time of day. It was interesting that few owners commented on feeding chicken wings or drumsticks, or other types of \u2018raw meaty bones\u2019, despite the perceived health and behavioural benefits of eating this type of ration as a component of the diet.28, 29 Interestingly, some 13% of households fed a diet consisting exclusively of dry cat food; the majority of these (18/26 households) fed \u2018premium diets\u2019 obtained from veterinarians or pet stores. Recent data have emphasised that it is \u2018unphysiological\u2019 to exclusively feed a calorically dense, high fat/high carbohydrate diet to a species that evolved as an obligate carnivore.30 Feeding of such high glycaemic index diets, especially when they are fed \u2018free choice\u2019 (ie, virtually ad libutum), has been linked with the development of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hepatic lipidosis, osteoarthritis and idiopathic cystitis.30, 31, 32, 33 As pedigree cats were more likely to be fed such diets according to our survey, the increased risk of these conditions in certain breeds may be related to dietary factors, additional genetic predispositions, or the interaction between these factors.",

A decrease in the male to female ratio with age was also detected in a telephone survey of pet ownership in Perth.25 The most likely explanation for this is a greater morbidity and mortality associated with behaviours of young male cats, such as the propensity to roam and fight, and thus be at risk for vehicular trauma, falls and infections related to fighting (bite abscesses, FIV and infections with environmental saprobes).34, 35 The tendency for this difference to be accentuated in cats older than 10 years may represent the impact of a cumulative risk over a normal life-span, but it is possible also that delayed effects are referable to the lag period for long-standing FIV infection to cause terminal conditions, eg, lymphoma.15 As has been emphasised recently in a study of renal disease in Australian cats,10 the male:female ratio in \u2018normal cats\u2019 must be considered when looking for gender associations in specific diseases. Conditions previously documented to have a male preponderance, such as FIV infection15, 16 lymphosarcoma,20 nocardiosis,18 feline infectious peritonitis11 and cryptococcosis17 would be even more likely to be strongly linked with male gender considering the data for normal cats presented here.",

There was a trend for pedigree cats to have more likely received a vaccination during the preceding 12 months compared to crossbred cats. Older cats were significantly less likely to have been vaccinated in the preceding 3 years compared to younger cats.

This suggests that most cat owners are prepared to regularly seek veterinary services as required, or to respond to postal reminder systems for annual \u2018wellness examinations\u2019. The reported reason for veterinary visits includes a broad range of ailments and procedures. Vaccinations, neutering, traumatic injuries including cat fight abscesses and teeth/gum issues accounted for the majority of consultations. Similar to the finding for vaccination, older cats were significantly more likely to have visited a veterinarian >1 year ago compared to younger cats. This reduction in likelihood of veterinary attention with age probably reflects that neutering and traumatic injury are less common among older cats and also that some owners believe they require less frequent vaccinations.",
