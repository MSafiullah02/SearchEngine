On multiple logistic regression, novel factors associated with development of BPD-LPH included presence of maternal diabetes, EPH, tracheostomy, tracheitis, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH, grade \u22653) and systemic steroid use. For EPH, these were maternal diabetes, IVH grade \u22653, high frequency ventilator use, and absence of maternal antibiotics use. Conclusion We identified novel factors and confirmed previously established factors with development of LPH and EPH, which can help develop a screening strategy in BPD patients.",

Prenatal steroids, gentle ventilation techniques, as well as exogenous surfactant have increased survival rates in preterm infants and decreased the severity of lung injury [2] . Over the last two decades, while survival rates of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants has steadily improved, the number of patients with BPD has remained the same or even increased [3, 4] . BPD is associated with increased mortality, poor neurodevelopmental outcome, and long-term respiratory complications in survivors [4] [5] [6] .",

            "text": "Among the cardiovascular sequelae, pulmonary hypertension (PH) contributes significantly to the high morbidity and mortality in BPD patients. Vascular remodeling, reduced alveolar-capillary surface area, altered distribution of vessels, and abnormal vascular tone and reactivity result in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [7] . Increased PVR leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and subsequently right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and RV failure. There have been multiple retrospective and prospective studies which have recognized various risk factors for the development of PH in infants with BPD such as LBW, small for gestational age (SGA), duration of mechanical ventilation, use of high frequency ventilation, longer duration of antibiotics, surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus and severe BPD [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However some of these studies used a limited number of perinatal factors to seek association with the development of PH. There have been limited studies to find the factors associated with Early PH (EPH) and also the relationship of EPH with Late PH (LPH) and BPD [9, [13] [14] [15] . We conducted a retrospective case-control observational study on a fairly large sample size to investigate the association of multiple perinatal factors using standardized definitions for development of EPH and LPH using defined echocardiographic criteria in preterm infants with BPD. We used a comprehensive list of pre-and postnatal variables with the goal of a detailed analysis of all potential risk factors contributing to E/LPH. In addition, we investigated the relationship between EPH and LPH, with the aim of an earlier detection of BPD-LPH for a potential future utility of an improved therapeutic approach to identify and manage BPD-LPH to decrease morbidity/mortality in these infants.",

Normally distributed continuous variables were analyzed using independent sample t-test, while Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normal distributions. To determine the effect of all the prenatal and postnatal variables on the outcome of LPH and EPH, binomial logistic regression was used to arrive at odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted OR were determined by multiple logistic regression, to control for possible confounding effects of other variables. In the multivariate model, LPH (yes or no) and EPH (yes or no) were considered as the dependent variables separately, and all the prenatal and postnatal variables were analyzed as independent variables, which were adjusted for BW and sex as covariates. We also replaced BW with GA, with no major impact in our results. All data were analyzed with SPSS 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P values \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was conducted to determine the model's goodness of fit.",

We confirmed several well-known factors [34] , and determined several novel factors associated with the development of LPH and EPH in patients with BPD. Different studies have defined LPH as PH diagnosed after 2, 4, 36 weeks PMA or on final echocardiograms before discharge [9, [13] [14] [15] 35] . To qualify for the BPD definition, an infant should require treatment with >0.21 FiO 2 for at least 28 days and then classified at 36 weeks PMA [16] . On that basis, we used the cutoff at 28 DOL to define LPH and EPH. There have been a few studies, which have defined EPH as PH diagnosed within first week, 2 weeks or 4 weeks of life [8, 9, [13] [14] [15] . It is possible that different pathways could be at play contributing to the pathogenesis of PH diagnosed during these time periods; hence, we divided EPH in three different categories to see if any of them could predict the development of LPH in BPD patients.",

However, in contrast to previously described associations, we did not find a significant association with development of LPH with the use of antenatal steroids, IUGR, oligohydramnios, PPROM, modes of resuscitation used in delivery room, APGAR scores, surfactant use, surgical closure of PDA, or multiple gestation [9, 10, 35, [37] [38] [39] . A number of reasons could explain the lack of significant association with the factors noted above; among them, the most likely one is probably the differences in our patient/referral population, compared with other studies.

Recently, it has been proposed that BPD has its origins during fetal life and antenatal events including maternal placental under-perfusion are determining factors of the development of BPD [41] [42] [43] [44] . Diabetes can result in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation [45] , which might be associated with maternal under-perfusion and in turn be associated with BPD as well as LPH in these infants. As the screening test for gestational diabetes is done from 24 to 28 weeks of GA unless at high risk for diabetes, we might have missed some of the mothers who potentially would have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes later during pregnancy [22] .",

Most of these factors were consistently associated with EPH I and III. Multiple theories including maternal placental under-perfusion, disruption of normal angiogenesis etc. can be applied to this association. In the clinical setting, early CE < 28 DOL can be very useful for the early identification of preterm infants at high risk for BPD and LPH.",

These conditions might be associated with high risk of developing LPH due to the presence and persistence of inflammation in the airway and lung parenchyma, as well as due to severity of illness. Fourteen (82%) out of 17 patients who required tracheostomy were already diagnosed with LPH before placement of the tracheostomy tube. This might suggest these infants are at a high risk of having long-term ventilator dependency and so at risk of getting a tracheostomy. In our cohort, the number of severe BPD patients was slightly higher than many other studies. We attribute this skewness to the severity of illness of patients admitted to the level IV referral based NICU serving most of the underserved population of Philadelphia, PA. Cardiac catheterization has been accepted as the gold standard for diagnosing PH, however it is invasive and is not easily performed in premature neonates, and hence serial echocardiography is recommended as the main tool to screen for PH in BPD patients despite its limitations [46] [47] [48] . In our study, the diagnosis of E/LPH was made solely from echocardiography reports read by different pediatric cardiologists, which can cause inter-observer variability. A number of limitations of the BPD definition have been described; however, given its current universal practical value, we chose the NIH consensus definition for our study [49] . Another limitation of our study was that being a retrospective study, we could not control factors such as the consistent timing to get a CE. Despite these limitations, we report some important findings, which could potentially improve the earlier identification and management of premature patients with BPD. The other strengths of our study include the use of standardized definitions and a large sample size of our study cohort. Furthermore, the characteristics of our study population (racial distribution etc.) as well as the management of these infants remained reasonably consistent over the time period at our urban NICU.",

We propose to have at least one echocardiogram done to screen for PH < 28 DOL in premature neonates requiring respiratory support with FiO 2 > 0.21, which can help strategize identification and management of BPD and LPH. Prospective studies are needed to validate this approach. ",
