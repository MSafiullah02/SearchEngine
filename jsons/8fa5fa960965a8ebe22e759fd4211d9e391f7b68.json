Therefore, DNAm could plausibly be associated with the excess mortality from specific diseases and consequently with all-cause mortality. This was exemplified by the previous investigations on smoking-associated DNAm changes and their relationship with lung cancer incidence/mortality and mortality from any cause, cancer and CVD [8] [9] [10] .",

Following the first study reporting an association of DNAm age with all-cause mortality by Marioni et al. 13 , the association was consistently demonstrated in various longitudinal studies 15, 16 , for individual age-associated CpGs 17 and also for newly identified age-associated CpGs 18 .

Of the 406 deaths in the case-cohort sample of the discovery panel, 90 were also included in the subcohort owing to random selection of subcohort at baseline. The time between blood sample collection and death ranged from 0.2 to 12.3 years (median (interquartile range (IQR), 7.4 (4.5-9.6) years) for these 406 participants. The corresponding figures for the 231 deaths in the validation panel were 0.2-13.8 years (range) and 8.6 (5.6-11.6) years (median (IQR)). The characteristics of the participants in the subcohort of the discovery panel are similar as those of the participants in the validation panel, except that the proportion of women was larger in the subcohort than in the validation cohort. In comparison with those two subgroups, the group of deceased participants in the discovery panel featured higher proportions of men, smokers, old (470 years) and inactive participants, and participants with prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, CVD and cancer at baseline. The characteristics of the KORA (Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg) study population are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The average age was similar in KORA and ESTHER participants (61 versus 62 years), but KORA participants had a much broader age range (31-82 years) than ESTHER participants (50-75 years).",

Ten CpGs (cg01612140, cg05575921, cg06126421, cg08362785, cg10321156, cg14975410, cg19572487, cg23665802, cg24704287 and cg25983901) were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms14617 (LASSO) regression. Preliminary analyses in ESTHER samples showed that Z40% deaths occurred among participants with methylation levels in the highest quartile of cg08362785 (hypermethylated among deaths) or in the first quartile of the other 9 CpGs (demethylated among deaths) ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). We therefore used the fourth quartile value of cg08362785 and first quartile values of other nine CpGs as the cutoff points, to define aberrant methylation for each CpG (the exact cutoff points are listed in Supplementary Table 4 ). Participants with aberrant methylation at 1-10 CpGs had a mortality score of 1-10, respectively, and participants without aberrant methylation at any of the 10 CpGs had score of 0. Table 3 shows the associations of score with all-cause mortality. Compared with participants with a score of 0, those who had a score of 1, 2-5 and 5 \u00fe had 2-, 3-and 7-fold risk of dying, controlling for all the potential confounding factors. Analyses restricted to only older participants (Z60 years) yielded essentially the same risk estimates, for example, HRs (95% CI) were 2.14 (1.02-4.47), 3.38 (1.68-6.80) and 7.44 (3.50-15.84), respectively, for a score of 1, 2-5 and 5 \u00fe versus score \u00bc 0. Similar patterns of distribution of deceased were also observed in KORA participants ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Using the cutoff points from the ESTHER cohort defining aberrant methylation of ten CpGs (Supplementary Table 4 ), replicated analyses in the KORA cohort showed consistent patterns and similar risk estimates (Table 3) . Crude HRs (95% CI) for participants with score of 1, 2-5 and 5 \u00fe were 1.21 (0.37-3.97), 6.42 (2.55-16.18) and 19.29 (5.58-66.63) , respectively, compared with score \u00bc 0. In the fully adjusted model, three-and six-fold increases in mortality persisted for score levels of 2-5 and 5 \u00fe , respectively. Using cutoff points (quartiles) of KORA itself defining aberrant methylation of the ten CpGs to build the mortality score, risk estimates were larger than those derived from using ESTHER's cutoff points. For example, the HR (95% CI) in the fully adjusted model was 7.41 (1.61-34.07) for participants with score of 5 \u00fe . In addition, a continuous risk score was computed through linear combination of LASSO regression coefficient weighted methylation values of the ten CpGs (the combination formula is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1) . A similar trend that mortality monotonously increased with increasing continuous risk score was observed in both the ESTHER (risk score ranged from \u00c0 3.92 to \u00c0 0.72; median (IQR), \u00c0 2.70 ( \u00c0 2.98 to \u00c0 2.35)) and the KORA cohorts (risk score ranged from \u00c0 4.40 to \u00c0 1.51; median (IQR), \u00c0 3.15 ( \u00c0 3.41 to \u00c0 2.86)). Figure 2 shows the corresponding dose-response relationships derived from restricted cubic spline regression with adjustment for all the covariates again 28 .",

Although there is evidence that genes containing the identified CpGs are related to various types of common diseases, our study was the first to link DNAm of the vast majority of these genes to mortality in the general population. We additionally demonstrated that a risk score based on DNAm of ten identified CpGs was a very strong predictor for all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality, and we confirmed this finding in an independent cohort study. None of the newly identified CpGs overlapped with previously established ageingrelated CpGs and the strong associations of score with mortality were also independent from the epigenetic clock.",

All these CpGs (except cg26963277 in KCNQ1OT1) were also the top signals in previous EWASs on smoking 2 . In addition to the 22 CpGs identified to be associated with smoking in previous EWASs 2, 24 , another 26 of the 58 CpGs were also smoking-associated in the current study. Furthermore, even though a few other CpGs were found to be associated with alcohol consumption, diabetes or cancer, such as cg18181703 in SOCS3 and cg26470501 in BCL3, most of them also showed associations with smoking exposure in our analyses ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . These findings suggest that tobacco smoking is the strongest factor leaving imprints on DNAm such that smoking rather than other common health risk factors accounts for the major burden of morbidity and mortality involving epigenetic programming. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms which remain to be elucidated in further research, it appears worthwhile pointing out that prevention of or intervention on smoking-related DNAm changes may provide major improvement in premature death prevention, given the reversibility of smoking-induced methylomic aberrations 29, 30 .",

The chromosome region 19q13.3 harbours six mortality-related CpGs mapped to BCL3, ERCC1, SLC1A5 and PPP1R15A. Although ERCC1 methylation has been previously reported in lung and breast cancer 31,32 , DNAm of BCL3, SLC1A5 and PPP1R15A were first linked to health-related outcomes in our study. In light of the known gene functions of BCL3 (pathogenesis of CVD and solid tumours) [33] [34] [35] , SLC1A5 (a glutamine transporter in various types of cancer development, progression and response to therapy) 36 and PPP1R15A (neurological and CVD pathophysiology, as well as obesity and insulin resistance in animal models) 37-39 , it appears plausible that DNAm may play regulating roles in the development or progression of the respective diseases, which requires elucidation in future studies. This also applies to most of the other genes known to be related to specific diseases whose relationship to methylation-relevant outcomes were first disclosed in our study, such as DNAm of SARS, VCAM1, KCNQ1OT1, MIR19A, SEMA7A, BCL3, PPP1R15A and PDE9A for CVD, DNAm of SQLE, MIR19A, MIR10A, SOCS3, CALR, BCL3 and SLC1A5 for lung cancer, and DNAm of ATL3, SHANK2 and PPP1R15A for neurological diseases. In addition, it is known that the chromosomal region 11p15.5 contains clusters of epigenetically regulated genes, for example, KCNQ1 and KCNQ1OT1, which have been implicated in T2D 26, 27 . We found two mortality-related CpGs (cg07123182 and cg26963277) in KCNQ1OT1 in 11p15.5. Of note, associations with prevalent T2D and mortality were also observed in the current study for cg23190089 in SLC22A18AS (on 11p15.4), a locus located B198 kb downstream of cg26963277 in KCNQ1OT1. The chromosome region 11p15.5/4, along with SLC1A5, SQLE and SOCS3 methylation that were suggested to be involved in T2D in both the current and previous studies 5, 25, [40] [41] [42] , therefore appear to be attractive targets for diabetes investigation, and even for CVD given the biological functions of these genes and their methylation in CVD 40, 43 and also the well-known causal relationship between diabetes and CVD. Similar to SQLE, KCNQ1OT1 and SOCS3, which are involved in diabetes, CVD and various cancers 5, 26, 40, [43] [44] [45] [46] , most identified genes are characterized by their relevance to multiple diseases, making them the most robust signals on an epigenome-wide scale, which may explain the extremely strong association of the risk score based on identified DNAm markers with all-cause mortality.",

            "text": "The recently established epigenetic clock (DNAm age) has received growing attention as an increasing number of studies have uncovered it to be a proxy of biological ageing [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and thus potentially providing a measure for assessing health and mortality. Intriguingly, we targeted mortality-related DNAm changes and did not find any overlap with previously established CpGs that are used to determine the DNAm age 11, 12 . Our findings are in line with evidence, suggesting that DNAm involved in ageing or health-related outcomes are mostly [19] [20] [21] . The difference could also plausibly result from the fact that DNAm age was originally trained as precisely as possible to track chronological age and might thus be more indicative of natural ageing beyond the effect of disease, as exemplified by the much stronger association of DNAm age with mortality in oldest population (mean age 86.1 years) 15 to whom common chronic diseases, such as CVD and cancer, might not continue to pose predominant risks 49 . Given characteristics of the identified genes and of our study population (mean age 62 years) that is at high-risk age for suffering from major diseases, the currently identified DNAm regions might be more indicative of disease-related outcomes and mortality. Only one previous study has also determined genome-wide methylomic mortality predictors, which were also distinct from the established ageingassociated sites 11, 12 but also different from signatures discovered in our study. A plausible explanation is that this study was conducted in a very old population (mean age 90 \u00fe years), in which causes of death might be distinct from those observed in our study 49 . Lack of gene expression data hindered exploration of the roles of the identified DNAm sites in regulating the relevant gene expression. Diseases associated with the identified genes were determined based on a literature search. Whether and how DNAm of those genes are involved in development or progression of the described diseases needs to be elucidated by future multidisciplinary research. For example, genetic factors might potentially be involved in the observed methylation-related mortality and the interplay between genetic factors and these methylation markers warrants to be explored. In the analysis, we did not exclude probes that might be affected by known SNPs as annotated by 'Infinium HD Methylation SNP List' (http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/infinium_humanm ethylation450_beadchip_kit/downloads.html). We later retrieved data of 32 such SNPs for 24 identified CpGs in 581 ESTHER participants of the validation set. Only one SNP-CpG pair (rs524-cg03707168) showed a significant association. However, no association was observed between rs524 and all-cause mortality irrespective of controlling for DNAm of cg03707168, whereas the strong association of cg03707168 with mortality did not change when controlling for rs524. In addition, no interaction was detected between rs524 and cg03707168 in relation to mortality. Nevertheless, potential genetic variants, that is, methylation quantitative trait loci for the identified candidates, should be systematically assessed in further studies. Despite the overall large size of the study population, sample size limitations restricted the list of identified sites, which should be extended in future larger longitudinal studies. In addition, the effect sizes (that is, average methylation difference between survivors and deaths) of most identified loci are relatively small as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Plausible reasons are that methylation levels were measured on average 8.2 years before dying and presumably stronger methylation difference restricted to specific causes of death are expected to be diluted in an analysis of all-cause mortality. Another limitation is that DNAm was quantified in whole blood samples. Even though we controlled for the effect of potential cell shift by adjustment for leukocyte composition estimated according to an established and commonly applied algorithm 50 , residual confounding by leukocyte distribution cannot be ruled out. However, this would not diminish the value of the identified markers for mortality prediction, for which easy accessibility of blood samples is a major advantage. Finally, although we included a variety of covariates in the regression analyses, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed associations between the identified methylation markers and mortality might be explained to some extent by incompletely controlled or uncontrolled confounding factors. For example, for smoking-related candidates, the observed associations might be partially confounded by imperfect controlling for smoking exposure or by potential confounders related to smoking. Despite its limitations, the prospective nature of the present study, the inclusion of large representative samples of participants from the general population, the long-term follow-up, the hypothesis-free approach with independent internal and external validation, as well as comprehensive adjustment for a variety of common risk factors in data analyses, are major strengths of the current study, which renders novel findings for future verification.",

The ESTHER study populations were described separately in the discovery and validation panel with respect to major sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and prevalent diseases at baseline. An epigenome-wide screening for mortalityrelated CpGs was first carried out in the case-cohort samples, using weighted Cox regression models that account for the case-cohort sampling design by Barlow weighting (the inverse of the subcohort sampling fraction, 1/(548/2499)) 58,59 . The models with methylation b-values as explanatory variables were adjusted for age, sex and batch effects. After correcting for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach, CpGs that reached genome-wide significance (FDR o0.05) were entered into the validation phase, in which the associations with mortality were further analysed by multiple Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, batch effects, leukocyte composition 50 , smoking status (never, former and current smoker), body mass index (kg m \u00c0 2 ), physical activity (inactive, low, medium/ high), alcohol consumption (grams per day), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), total cholesterol level (mg dL \u00c0 1 ), and prevalence of hypertension, CVD, diabetes and cancer. CpGs with FDRo0.05 in the validation panel were deemed as mortalityrelated loci. A flowchart of study design and data analysis is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 .",

To develop a DNAm-based mortality risk score, we applied the LASSO Cox regression 60 with regularization parameter chosen by tenfold cross-validation following the 'one standard error' rule 61, 62 , selecting candidates among the identified CpGs. The associations of the score with all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality were assessed first in the validation subset of the ESTHER cohort and then in the independent KORA cohort using multiple Cox regression models, adjusted for the covariates listed above (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). All analyses were then repeated in men and women separately. In addition, to compare the predictive value of score with that of recently established methylomic predictors of 'epigenetic age acceleration' (that is, Dage \u00bc DNAm age \u00c0 chronological age), we assessed the associations of both score and Dage with all-cause mortality simultaneously. DNAm age was calculated according to two commonly applied algorithms introduced by Hannum et al. 11 and Horvath et al. 12 .",
