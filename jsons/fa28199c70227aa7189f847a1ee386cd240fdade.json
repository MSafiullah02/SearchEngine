Currently, no clinical features of CAP are characteristic of viral pneumonia. Detection of RSV infection in adults is hampered by low viral shedding, and therefore the most sensitive method should be used for diagnosis [4, 8] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than viral isolation (VI) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for viral detection in adults [6, 9] ; however, in some studies, PCR has not significantly increased the diagnostic serology yield [6, 7, 9, 10] . Serology for diagnosis of respiratory viruses is a sensitive technique that is primarily used in research [11] . A $4-fold in antibody titer in paired samples is necessary to confirm a recent infection. Although the rise in detection of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies is sensitive and provides relevant information [4] , few studies of CAP have used microneutralization for RSV diagnosis [12] [13] [14] .
