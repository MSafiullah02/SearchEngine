Though never published by Reed and Frost (versions of the model were eventually published by their students (3, 4) ), their model was one of the first mechanistic models of infectious disease transmission, and at a time long before digital computing, they may have been the first to use simulation methods to understand the epidemic process. Reed and Frost were pioneers in the study of infectious disease dynamics using mechanistic models, a field of epidemiology that has developed in parallel with the associative statistical models and methods of causal inference that dominate much of epidemiologic research. Over the past century, mechanistic models have played an essential role in shaping public health policy, the way we study interventions aimed at controlling infectious diseases, and the theory on which disease control is based.",

            "text": "Perhaps the first mechanistic model of infectious disease transmission used in assessing intervention strategies was a mathematical model of malaria transmission developed and refined by Ronald Ross in a series of papers published between 1908 and 1921 (9) (10) (11) , pre-dating the work of Reed and Frost by decades. This model had a direct and powerful message for public health: Malaria could be controlled and even eliminated through mosquito control, even if the vector could not be completely eliminated. Ross used his theoretical framework to develop and advocate for multiple indices, including the prevalence rate and the entomological inoculation rate (12) , that could effectively characterize the intensity of transmission in an area and identify goals for control. In the wake of the founding of the Global Malaria Eradication Program by the World Health Organization, George Macdonald (13) extended Ross's work in order to justify the use of insecticide as a tool for global malaria eradication (14) . In particular, he showed that increasing daily mosquito mortality from 5% to 45% would be adequate to eliminate malaria even in locations with the highest transmission intensities in Africa. Mechanistic models continue to play an important role in the fight against malaria. The work of Ross and MacDonald looms large to this day, with a recent review finding that the majority of models published since 1940 depart from central hypotheses of the Ross-MacDonald model in only a few key assumptions, if any (15) .",

            "text": "Although there are numerous instances over the past century in which mechanistic models have contributed to the control of a single disease (see Figure 1 for some examples), their larger contribution may be in our general understanding of disease control. The prime example is the concept of herd immunity and the critical vaccination threshold. Herd immunity is the indirect protection offered to members of the population susceptible to the disease (i.e., not immune and with the potential to be infected) by the immunity of surrounding individuals, and the critical vaccination threshold is the percentage of the population that must be vaccinated in order for the introduction of an infectious case to not spark an epidemic (16) . To estimate the critical vaccination threshold, we must first understand one of the most critical concepts of infectious disease dynamics, the basic reproductive number, R 0 . R 0 is the number of cases that a single infectious individual is expected to cause in a fully susceptible population. This concept was first introduced in demography and underwent significant development by Lotka while on a visit to the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1925 (see Heesterbeek (17) for a full history of the development of R 0 in infectious disease). Although this value does vary by setting, for many pathogens it is remarkably consistent across contexts and serves as a rough quantification of pathogen transmissibility. Based on dynamic models, it has been shown that if we vaccinate a proportion of the population equivalent to 1 \u2212 1/R 0 , then the pathogen will fail to spread in that population. This is the critical vaccination threshold, and it has helped to set vaccination goals for a number of diseases, particularly when elimination is the goal.",

For instance, immediately after the introduction of a vaccine or improvement in vaccination rates, a disease may appear to be eliminated from a population. However, this long honeymoon period may be followed by a large, resurgent, outbreak that bigger than the yearly epidemics seen before the introduction of vaccination (though the cumulative number of cases is still less than what would have been seen without vaccination) (18) . These results have helped public health officials to understand that initial apparent vaccine successes may not last, as well as what to expect after introducing a new vaccine. Mechanistic models have also been used to understand the optimal age range for vaccination campaigns (19, 20) , how such campaigns should be timed (21) , and how best to use vaccines when supplies are limited (20, 22) . Models have also been used to design active response strategies for vaccine use, including ring vaccination strategies such as those implemented in the smallpox eradication campaign (23) . Models were also used to assess strategies to respond to a bioterrorist release of smallpox in the early part of the 21st century and were influential in setting policy for response (24) (25) (26) (27) .",

The poster child for the phenomenon is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). For most people, rubella infection causes a relatively minor infection characterized by fever and rash; however, when pregnant women are infected during the first trimester of pregnancy, it cause CRS, which results in severe complications of pregnancy including congenital disorders and death of the fetus (28) . Because vaccination increases the average age of infection (by decreasing the hazard of infection), a vaccination program that does not achieve sufficient coverage can increase the number of pregnant women who are infected, thereby increasing incidence of CRS (29) . This is not simply a theoretical concept; although there have been no sustained increases in the incidence of CRS (in part due to the public health response), both Costa Rica and Greece experienced transient increases in CRS burden after rubella vaccination (30, 31) . In light of the threat of CRS, mechanistic models have played an important role in setting World Health Organization recommendations for the introduction of a rubella vaccine. These recommendations encourage countries to wait to introduce the vaccine until measles vaccination rates (measles and rubella vaccines are usually given together) are high enough to guarantee a reduction in CRS cases and to strongly consider vaccination campaigns in women of childbearing age before the vaccine is introduced (32) .",

The prime example of an infectious disease black swan is the 1918 influenza pandemic, which is estimated to have killed 50-100 million people in 2 years (39) . Governments and policy makers depend on simulations built on mechanistic models to decide the extent of these threats and what can be done to confront them. For the past decade and a half, there have been ongoing concerns that one of several strains of influenza A that have been known to infect humans from domestic poultry (H5N1, H9N2, etc.), might develop the ability to transmit efficiently in humans and cause a major pandemic. H5N1 strains are seen as particularly concerning because of their high case fatality rate and the substantial increase in the number of human cases (particularly in Southeast Asia) that started in 2003 (40) . Independent teams of disease modeling experts developed sophisticated agent-based models of potential emergence events to determine whether effective antiviral agents could be used to contain an emerging influenza at the source (6, 41) . These models showed that under reasonable expectations of the transmissibility of an emerging influenza (i.e., R 0 in the 1.5-2.0 range), containment was possible, though perhaps not practical, as it would require the deployment of millions of courses of antiviral medication, very early detection of the disease, and rapid response. In parallel work, groups considered how the impact of a pandemic could be mitigated in the United States if the initial containment attempt was unsuccessful (42) (43) (44) . The efforts of independent groups showed that something more than social-distancing measures (e.g., school closure, case isolation) would be needed to control a pandemic and that effective antivirals could help. In part on the basis of this work, the United States and other countries decided to stockpile antivirals to combat a future pandemic, a decision that has since been criticized by some (45) . However, these criticisms have been focused on concerns about the efficacy of the stockpiled antiviral drugs (46) rather than the results of the modeling work itself.",

After 2 research groups had identified 2 different sets of mutations to the H5N1 virus that would be sufficient to allow airborne transmission in a mammalian host (48, 49) , Russell et al. (47) developed a mathematical model of the within host dynamics of influenza evolution. Although the authors were unable to confidently estimate the probability of the emergence of a pandemic H5N1 strain because of uncertainties about the underlying biological processes involved, they were able to identify the biological factors on which this probability would most strongly depend and recommend studies (e.g., deep sequencing of viral samples from H5N1-infected hosts) that might help to develop more precise predictions. There has been considerable debate surrounding the ethics of gain-of-function experiments for H5N1 influenza (50) , but if such experiments are to be justified, they must provide us a way to have advanced warning of a coming pandemic, a task that may only be possible through mechanistic models. However, to be successful, these models will require substantial additional theoretical work on how viral evolution interacts with the distribution of immunity in the population.",

Initial assessments relied heavily on dynamic models of a variety of types, including phylogenetic techniques paired with demographic models, models based on the probability of the observed number of introductions of pandemic H1N1 into populations outside of Mexico, analysis of epidemic curves, and the results of detailed investigations of early outbreaks (51, 52) . Analyses by a number of groups quickly showed that the emergent pandemic H1N1 virus was behaving very much like alreadycirculating strains, and although it was still potentially a significant public health threat, it was unlikely to have a qualitatively different impact on mortality or morbidity than circulating influenza strains.",

The last of these shows both the power of mechanistic approaches and the dangers of its misuse. In the summer and fall of 2014, the number of Ebola cases in West Africa was continuing to grow, and it was unclear how severe the epidemic would eventually become. To address this issue, as well as the threat of spread to other countries, a number of modeling exercises were conducted (e.g., Gomes et al. (57) ). Of particular note was a model released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that predicted that, without further intervention, 1.4 million cases of Ebola would occur in Liberia and Sierra Leone by mid-January 2015 (58). This did not come to pass, and although the authors noted that such long-term projections were tenuous, the media and many in the public health community made much of this number. Of course interventions and behavior change did occur, but the authors had also made tenuous assumptions about how the populations of Liberia and Sierra Leone mix together, essentially treating each country as a homogenous entity. In contrast, the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team, who also made projections based on an unconstrained epidemic, declined to forecast further than 2 months into the future (56), and though theirs was a moderate overestimate of total cases, they avoided publishing any panic-inducing overestimations (they projected approximately 20,000 cases by November 2, 2014; approximately 13,000 actually were reported by that point) (59) . Forecasting the course of disease spread is difficult to do well, particularly in the context of an active response. It also may be the least of what mechanistic approaches to disease epidemiology have to offer. The aforementioned work, particularly that of the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team, also characterized important aspects of Ebola's natural history and epidemiology, including its basic reproductive number (R 0 ), the decline in R over the course of the epidemic, the incubation period, and the serial interval, properties of the disease that will be important to understand should it re-emerge.",

They were particularly interested in the effectiveness of the tools available when first confronting a novel pathogen: contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine. They presented evidence that a critical determinant of the controllability of a pathogen is the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, expressed by their parameter \u03b8.

One of the most successful was a project that forecasted the impact of respiratory syncytial virus immunization campaigns on the temporal pattern of incidence in the United States. Using mechanistic transmission models, Pitzer et al. (63, 64) made detailed predictions of the impact of vaccination on the multiannual dynamics of rotavirus, as well as the impact of the vaccine on genotype circulation. These forecasts of broad qualitative impacts of interventions are critical tests of models. Detailed prospective predictions of changes that will occur with changes in health policy, which are then validated, will provide the best evidence of the utility of mechanistic models in the future.",

For example, a na\u00efve approach would be to consider that all vaccines acted in the same way, providing complete protection for some fraction of the population. However, in reality vaccines may be leaky and provide protection only in some dimensions (65) . Vaccines may prevent infection all together (e.g., the measles vaccine) (70), offer protection against pathogenic disease but still allow individuals to become infected and transmit the disease (e.g., acellular pertussis vaccines (71)), or only prevent onward transmission of the disease (e.g., transmissionblocking vaccines for malaria (72) ). In order to anticipate and assess the impact of vaccines once scaled up to widespread use, the specific actions of the vaccine in reducing infection, onward transmission, and disease must be disentangled. These specific mechanisms will contribute differently to the direct, indirect, and total effects of a vaccine. These effects are increasingly targets of inference during trials (73) , and developments in infectious disease theory have driven development of both inference tools and study design to measure specific impacts (65) .",

Infectious disease models play a critical role in incorporating indirect effects that can vary substantially across alternative programs. The design of immunization campaigns against human papillomavirus has to weigh the direct effects protecting women from human papillomavirus infection, as well as indirect protection resulting from immunization of both women and men.

Understanding the impact of different selective pressures on pathogens is inherently a task of population genetics. Models of the population dynamics of pathogens have been incorporated into models in order to explain the phylogenetic structure of pathogens. Sequence data have been used to infer basic reproductive numbers of pathogens (51, 78) , harkening back to Lotka's first use of the term to describe replication of organisms.
