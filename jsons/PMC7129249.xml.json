ESPP clients without index suicide attempt were thus not included in our data analysis as our comparison subjects from the preintervention phase were all suicide attempters. From this cohort, there were 351 suicide attempters included as the intervention group. The intervention group received intensive care management as detailed in the introductory section.

The NTECs regional mental health service serves a catchment area that hosts about one-fifth of the total population. In the preintervention period, all suicide attempters aged 65 years and older seeking help at publicly funded hospitals at NTEC were referred to psychogeriatric consultation-liaison services. With exception to NTEC, there was no database that systematically archived baseline clinical information of late-life suicide attempters presenting to other regional services in the preintervention phase. Suicide attempters presenting to other regional services during the preintervention phase were thus not included. Subjects in the preintervention group received standard psychogeriatric care (both outpatient and inpatient) after an index suicide attempt. In the preintervention phase, the standard psychogeriatric service was well equipped with multidisciplinary support from psychiatric inpatient/daycare facilities. The preintervention service was different from the ESPP in two aspects: 1) having no liaison with community gatekeepers and 2) lacking care management component and the multidisciplinary care planning and review meetings.",

For instance, use of historical cohort does not permit adequate control for particular baseline characteristics as in randomized controlled trials. In a publicly funded suicide intervention program that is intended for all in the city, it is impossible to have a contemporary control group receiving \u201ccare as usual.\u201d Under the \u201cone-country, two-systems\u201d administrative schema in China, socially compatible cities for comparison are virtually nonexistent. In this study, more often older people in the preintervention cohort were di-agnosed to have ICD-10 depressive disorder, living alone, and had history of previous suicide attempt, all well-known risk factors for suicide. Also, all pre-intervention subjects were referred from the inpatient consultation-liaison service, whereas some subjects in the intervention groups were referred from community gatekeepers. These uncontrolled baseline factors might account partly for the difference in the 2-year suicide rates. However, we found the \u201cgroupby-baseline variable\u201d interactions were insignificant in Poisson regression models, whereas only intervention group remained significant predictor for completed suicide. The degrees of underreporting of suicide reattempt in the 2-year follow-up period for both groups were also uncertain, because it remained inevitable in both pre- and postintervention phases that suicide attempts not requiring any clinical attention at the publicly funded healthcare system were more likely to be missed. On the other hand, underreporting of completed suicide was less likely as the \u201ccaseness\u201d was ascertained by standard judicial procedure.",

We have reported that excess elderly suicides in April 2003 coincided with the peak of incident SARS cases.34 Hence, the temporary suspension of healthcare services and the concurrent upsurge in elderly suicide rates lend support to the reversibility of the effect of the standard old-age psychiatric services. It was speculated that the aftermath effects of SARS such as mass pessimism and fear of the epidemic returning were carried through 2004, accounting for the relatively high suicide rates in older adults that year.35\n",

We speculate that the gatekeeper training component of the ESPP has resulted in better recognition of depressive illness and enhanced access of the service to the at-risk old-old women.

Earlier studies conducted in Gotland, Sweden, and Padua, Italy, showed that the effect of community-based suicide prevention for older people was specific to women.7,36 Recent studies of community-based interventions in rural Japan also observed that older women were more receptive to suicide prevention programming.37 The latest service statistics of the ESPP shows that more than half of the clients are women, indicating that at risk older men remain elusive to a two-tieredassertive care management model enhanced with gatekeeper training component. Future service provision should incorporate effective means to reach the high-risk older men. These measures might include strengthening the gate-keeping mechanisms in different sectors (non-goverment organizations [NGOs], social welfare sector, and primary care). Future studies should address the help-seeking behavior and barriers to healthcare among older men in our community, which in turn might inform innovative ways to engage this elusive risk group.",
