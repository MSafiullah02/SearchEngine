            "text": "Investigation of gastrointestinal disorders usually begins with rectal palpation after collection of a minimum database. If an abnormality such as abnormal masses, enlarged lymph nodes, thickened loops of bowel, or excessive abdominal fluid is found, ancillary diagnostic tools such as endoscopy, ultrasonography, radiography, or abdominocentesis can more specifically define the disorder. Endoscopic biopsies are usually small (1.8 to 2.3 mm) but sufficient for diagnostic purposes. Collection of excellent quality biopsies is challenging, especially with endoscopy and laparoscopy. Experience and teamwork are essential for the collection of good endoscopic or laparoscopic biopsies. Biopsy instrument slippage, incorrect angle placement, hemorrhage, risks of full-thickness biopsying, and iatrogenic perforation of the diseased gut with the endoscope are serious problems to manage. Bacterial contamination is also a real problem with endoscopic samples. Culture results must be compared to cytologic findings to reduce the risk of misinterpretation.",

If esophageal placement is uncertain or tracheal rings observed, withdraw the scope and make another attempt. Never force the endoscope without knowing its course. Pharyngo-oral retroflexion is a serious risk to equipment, and esophageal perforation is a serious risk to the horse. Examine the stomach along with the esophagus because gastric lesions frequently accompany esophageal lesions. For adequate visualization of the stomach in the adult horse, withhold food for at least 12 hours and water for 6 hours if the horse can tolerate water deprivation.6 To examine the duodenum, pass the endoscope along the greater curvature of the stomach and through the pylorus. This takes patience and experience. For colonic and rectal endoscopy, remove the feces either manually or, in small horses, using an enema. Pass a well-lubricated endoscope into the rectum. Air insufflation distends the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract for better mucosal visualization, especially for ulcers. Transrectal (5 MHz) and transabdominal (2.5 to 3.5 MHz) ultrasonography can be used to visualize and take a transcutaneous aspiration or punch biopsy of a mass.8\n",

Clinical laboratory findings can include malabsorption (decreased glucose and d-xylose absorption), hypoalbuminemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia (hemorrhage and chronic disease), and hypercalcemia (lymphoma and squamous-cell carcinoma). Peritoneal fluid frequently has an increased nucleated cell count (neutrophilic inflammation), increased protein, and, sometimes, exfoliated neoplastic cells. Microorganisms from the gut lumen may invade gastrointestinal neoplasms, resulting in abscessation and secondary septic peritonitis.",

Forty-six percent (11/24) of the B-cell lymphomas were T-cell\u2013rich, large B-cell lymphomas that contained a mixed lymphoid infiltrate of nonneoplastic, normal-appearing T-cells and large atypical B-cells with large, irregularly shaped nuclei, coarse chromatin, and atypical mitotic figures. Lymphocyte markers are necessary to differentiate mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma from T-cell\u2013rich, large B-cell lymphoma. A mixed lymphoma composed of both small and large neoplastic B-cells has occurred in the stomach of a horse.17 Additionally, a B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed in a horse with Sezary-like cells in the peripheral blood, cutaneous nodules, heart, abdominal cavity, and ventral colon.18 Paraneoplastic hypereosinophilia, although uncommon, has been reported in a horse with intestinal lymphoma.19\n",

The nucleus is small, oval to round to irregular, with coarse chromatin. Irregularly shaped chromocenters and nucleoli, presence of cytoplasmic rings (dyskeratosis), hyperchromasia, anisokaryosis, anisocytosis, caudate cells with extremely long cytoplasmic processes (tadpole cells), and intracytoplasmic migration of cells (emperipolesis) are features of dysplasia and neoplasia. Papanicolaou's stain is the best stain to evaluate keratinization, dyskeratotic changes, and cytologic features of thick cellular clusters.

Therefore, for the best cytologic interpretation, other causes for the presence of squamous cells in the sample must be ruled out. Two conditions that might be associated with squamous cells are ruptured gastric ulcers (possible dysplasia and neutrophilic inflammation) and inadvertent aspiration of amniotic fluid from a pregnant mare. Esophageal-gastric ulcers usually occur in foals or young horses whereas squamous-cell carcinomas usually occur in older horses (6 to 18 years of age).21 Endoscopy and ultrasonography are helpful in confirming a cytologic opinion. Squamous-cell carcinomas have a propensity to seed organ surfaces and metastasize extensively throughout the pleural and peritoneal cavities, similar to mesothelioma, resulting in pleural and peritoneal fluids containing carcinoma cells. Most horses with gastric squamous-cell carcinoma have abundant peritoneal fluid that is characterized by a neutrophilic inflammation, hemosiderophages, and erythrophagia.21 Sediment concentration and cytospin preparations increase the probability of finding squamous epithelium and evidence of neoplastic cytologic features in these samples.",
