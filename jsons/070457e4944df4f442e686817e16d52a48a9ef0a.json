To motivate people to take preventive measures, some heads of states used what may be characterized as the \"friendlier\" strategies in the form of infographics, infomercials, and hashtags. 2 On top of this, other governments have resorted to rather extreme tactics, which play on people's fears to regulate behaviour. Witness some cases in the Philippines as examples.",

Even the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, dissuades the public from disobeying the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) with remarks like, \"...If there is trouble or the situation arises that people fight and your lives are on the line, shoot them dead\". 5 The psychology literature refers to these scare tactics as \"fear appeals\".",

            "text": "Fear appeals are nothing new. As a pioneer on the subject, Howard Leventhal explains, feararousing communication is a tool often used to persuade others to act and behave in a certain way. 6 Parents use it to discipline children; bosses to drive staff productivity. Even medical practitioners employ \"fear-based medicine\" in clinical encounters when they try to coax patients to follow a course of action by issuing \"if you don't, then...\" threats. 7 Fear appeals have also permeated public health campaigns. Visual health warnings on cigarette packaging, for example, are a case in point. 8 While some, like R.F. Soames Job, have argued that such campaigns are ineffective 9 , others, like Kim Witte and Mike Allen found that \"strong fear appeals and highefficacy messages produce the greatest behavior change\" 10 . The verdict is still out whether such campaigns are effective or not. 9 As Irish Olympian John Treacy once said, \"fear is a great motivator\". It pushes our survival instincts into high gear. While fear appeals and scare tactics have been used in clear and present public health emergencies like COVID-19, the ethics of such public health communication interventions needs to be scrutinized. 11 In particular, whether these appeals and tactics are morally acceptable and appropriate. 12 It might be argued that scare tactics are acceptable in times of crisis so long as they urge \"large population segments, who are at moderate risk, to adopt risk-reducing practices... to influence those who are at high risk\". 11 Such a reason may perhaps be grounded on the utilitarian principle of doing what best promotes the greatest benefit for the greatest number. On the other hand, an argument premised on a Kantian, rights-based moral philosophy might say that if these tactics violate certain moral and legal rights that people hold inviolable, then such appeals are morally inappropriate. To preserve the Kantian ideal for appropriateness, it might be suggested that fear appeals \"should exclusively be used when pilot studies indicate that an intervention successfully enhances efficacy\". 13 In a time of the uncertainties of a global health crisis like COVID-19, however, a utilitarian may question this suggestion's moral acceptability. On the whole, then, the rightness of fear-mongering might therefore be the balance of its moral acceptability and appropriateness.",
