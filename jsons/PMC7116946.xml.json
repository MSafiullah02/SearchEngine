However, modelling multivariate time series with high correlation is more difficult than univariate cases and may cause the problem of collinearity. As such, the FastICA algorithms were used to decompose multivariate time series into mutually independent time series, and subsequently employed the IC ordering method to rank the ICs based on their importance in prediction. After that, univariate time series models were used on each independent series.",
