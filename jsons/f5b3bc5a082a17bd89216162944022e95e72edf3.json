R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population and is driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (1). Yet, it only characterizes transmission potential at the onset of the epidemic and varies geographically for a given infectious disease according to local healthcare provision, outbreak response, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. Furthermore, estimating R0 requires information about the natural history of the infectious disease. Thus, our ability to estimate reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is Data apart from epidemic data. Provincial demographic, transportation and socioeconomic data were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2) and other sources (see Table S2 ).",
