Before 2013 PEDV was seen only in Asian and European swine herds but since the first reports of PEDV in Iowa in May, 2013 (Chen et al., 2013, Cima, 2013b), the highly contagious and deadly coronavirus has rapidly spread across North America. Common clinical signs include diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in infected animals. High mortality (70\u2013100%) among neonates has led to significant economic losses (Cima, 2013a, Cima, 2013b).",

The rapid emergence of highly similar strains across the United States and the frequent detection of PEDV in livestock trailers indicates that swine transportation plays a major role in the spread of PEDV in the country (Lowe et al., 2014). Contaminated transportation equipment has been linked to the spread of several other important swine diseases (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli) making trailer disinfection common among United States pork producers (Dee et al., 2004, Dee et al., 2006, Rajkowski et al., 1998). Efficient disinfection for PEDV in animal contact spaces, including trailers and trucks, is currently one of the primary methods used to control the spread of the disease.",

            "text": "However, PEDV is difficult to culture outside of an animal model; thus, RT-PCR assays are currently the only tests available to pork producers and swine veterinarians to directly detect PEDV. Because RT-PCR only detects the viral nucleic acid, a positive RT-PCR result only indicates detection of PEDV viral RNA, but does not mean viable and infectious virus is present. Due to the limited testing options and the implications of environmental contamination, individuals are using RT-PCR to test trailers following disinfection to ensure that the equipment is free of PEDV before contact with na\u00efve animals. However, RT-PCR tends to underestimate disinfection efficacy compared to infectivity assays; meaning, RT-PCR positive results are obtained when in fact the trailer has been effectively disinfected. This drawback of RT-PCR has been recognized for various pathogens (Pecson et al., 2011, Poschetto et al., 2007, Suarez et al., 2003), as most disinfectants damage the protective capsid, but often, this mode of action has limited or no effect on the viral nucleic acid (Pecson et al., 2009). Although the disinfection treatments result in loss of infectivity, RT-PCR can still detect the intact viral RNA that remains within a noninfectious viral particle. While rapid progress is being made on viral culture methods, there is an immediate need for practical solutions to address the discrepancy between RT-PCR and infectivity assays. In practical terms, pork producers must consider all RT-PCR positive trailers as contaminated; the consequences of not doing so could be disastrous to their operation and the entire swine industry. However, the cost associated with extra cleaning and disinfection and additional time until a trailer tests negative is very expensive for pork producers.",

Presently there is a paucity of data examining disinfectant usage on PEDV RT-PCR results. Data from other pathogens indicate that some disinfectants (e.g., accelerated peroxide-based compounds and/or sodium hypochlorite) would better disrupt the viral RNA and produce more meaningful RT-PCR results (Charrel et al., 2001, Ma et al., 1994, Ojeh et al., 1995, Suarez et al., 2003).

To mimic the surface of a washed but not yet disinfected livestock trailer, 10.4 \u00d7 10.4 \u00d7 0.6 cm aluminum coupons (bare plate aluminum 6061-T651) were used. Aluminum coupons were cleaned with nucleic acid removing wipes (DNA AWAY, Molecular Bioproducts San Diego, CA), dried, and rinsed with distilled water. The surface of the coupons were then pitted (Davis, 1999) by submersion in a 5% acetic acid (distilled white vinegar) bath for 16 h, after which they were rinsed with distilled water, and air dried to simulate field conditions. The aluminum coupons were then autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for 15 min and the sterilized coupons were aseptically placed into sterile petri dishes. Twenty coupons were used for each disinfectant. Coupons were pre-heated to 37 \u00b0C before one ml of stock PEDV (1 \u00d7 106\n TCID50/ml) was added to each aluminum coupon, spread over the entire coupon using a spreader, and allowed to dry completely (60 min) in a biological safety cabinet at room temperature. Once dry the lids were replaced on the petri dishes and the dishes with aluminum coupons were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. After incubation the dishes were moved back to biosafety cabinets, the lids were removed, and 1 ml of respective disinfectant (2.06% sodium hypochlorite or 0.5% oxidizing agent) was added to each aluminum coupon. The disinfectant was spread over the entire surface of the coupon using a spreader and allowed to dry completely. Double distilled water was used as the sham disinfectant for the positive and negative controls. Once dry, the lids were replaced on the petri dishes and the dishes with aluminum coupons were again incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. A single swab was premoistened in viral storage medium (viral collection medium without Dey\u2013Engley neutralizing broth) was used to swab the entire surface of the aluminum coupon. The swab was put into 2 ml of viral storage medium and mixed by vortexing. The 20 samples of each treatment group were pooled together. The viral load in the samples was quantified with qRT-PCR and TCID50 assays as described above; infectivity was assessed with cell culture and a bioassay.",

Rectal swabs were collected daily for RT-PCR testing and the pigs were monitored for clinical signs of disease. Pigs were euthanized on day 10 post inoculation and tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde.

Back titration of the inoculum used for the positive control pigs was calculated to be 4.14 \u00d7 104 TCID50. In the bioassay, positive control pigs tested PEDV positive from rectal swabs on days 4 (n\n = 1) and 5 (n\n = 3) post inoculation; all three positive control pigs tested PEDV positive for the remainder of the study. PEDV was not detected in the rectal swabs from the negative control pigs nor the pigs challenged with the material collected from the swabbing of the aluminum coupons treated with 2.06% sodium hypochlorite and 0.5% oxidizing agent. Histologic evaluation of the positive control group demonstrated moderate to marked villus atrophy with collapse and fusion of the lamina propria. Epithelial cell vacuolization interpreted as hydropic degeneration was observed sporadically in this group. The changes observed in the experiment groups and the negative control group consisted of mild inflammatory changes which predominately eosinophilic in nature. This inflammation was considered an incidental background lesion.",

In contrast, only a few of the disinfectants were able to disrupt the viral RNA to the point that PEDV could not be detected by RT-PCR. While the qualitative results imply that the phenol, the quaternary ammonium, and the quaternary ammonium/glutaraldehyde combination had little impact on RT-PCR results (Table 2), the quantitative data show that these three classes of disinfectants did decrease the number of estimated viral copies per ml (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Despite a number of medically important human and animal coronaviruses, the mechanisms of action for disinfectants against these viruses are poorly understood. Perhaps the best supported mechanism is for glutaraldehyde where the chemical is believed to react with amino or sulfhydryl groups in capsid proteins, thereby damaging the capsid and inactivating the virus (McDonnell and Russell, 1999). Clearly this is an area in great need of future research.",

The samples collected from pitted aluminum coupons to simulate a livestock trailer were not infectious in cell culture or in na\u00efve pigs. Yet, neither of these two disinfectants were able to produce completely negative PCR results. The PEDV qRT-PCR results recorded after treatment with 2.06% sodium hypochlorite and 0.5% oxidizing agent were near the limit of detection and much less than the positive control; nonetheless, PEDV was still detectable with qRT-PCR post disinfection. The results from the in vitro experiments in the plastic petri dishes did not translate perfectly to the aluminum coupons. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is the pitted surface of the aluminum coupons. Following treatment with 5% acetic acid, the surface of the aluminum was rough and pitted. We hypothesize that these surface irregularities may have harbored inactive virus particles and that this situation is likely common in used livestock trailers. It is also important to note that the entire 108.16 cm2 surface of the aluminum coupons were swabbed, whereas only 47.8 cm2 of the petri dishes were swabbed. This increased sampling increased the likelihood of detecting residual PEDV RNA.",

Proper cleaning and surface preparation is critical to the success of any disinfection protocol. Organic material is known to inactivate many classes of disinfectants. Interestingly, presence of the fecal slurry did not impact the total number of RT-PCR positives in the present study. It is important to note that the cell culture medium used in the present study contained many organic compounds necessary for Vero cell growth; thus, even the samples generated in the absence of the fecal slurry may have contained significant disinfectant inhibitors.

In both objectives of the current study, we allowed the applied solutions to fully dry before proceeding to the next step of the protocol because most field disinfection protocols allow for complete drying following application of disinfectants. Complete drying took as long as 90 min in some situations and this impacted the temperature of the substrates (i.e., temperature changed during drying in the biosafety cabinets). Thus, the results of the 4 \u00b0C and \u221220 \u00b0C are likely overestimating the effectiveness of the disinfectants at those temperatures because colder temperatures will increase drying time and are known to have a negative effect on disinfectant activity (Shaker et al., 1986, Vaneseltine and Rahn, 1949). This limitation was unavoidable because the procedures had to be performed in a biosafety cabinet to maintain biocontainment of PEDV. Despite this limitation, we still observed temperature dependent differences in the data (Table 2).",

The very strong concentration of sodium hypochlorite (2.06%), the most effective in our study, is a serious hazard to human health (Racioppi et al., 1994). Contact with bare skin can result in chemical burns and inhalation of sodium hypochlorite irritates the respiratory tract and can cause pulmonary edema in some situations (Hostynek et al., 1990, Luttrell, 2001).
