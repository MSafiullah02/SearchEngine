Our study has also determined the proportion of non-English tweets by G7 world leaders and highlighted that this language barrier was easily overcome through Twitter\u2019s in-built Google translate function.17 We have evaluated the characteristics of viral tweets, including the use of government weblinks and viral videos to share information. Conducting this study highlighted the user-friendly nature of Twitter in searching information on COVID-19, due to concise content (limited to 280 characters per tweet) and the ability to quickly translate non-English tweets where necessary.",

A disproportionately high number of followers were attributed to the Twitter account of US President Donald Trump. This may in part be due to his previous celebrity status through reality television and popular culture. Indeed, musician Justin Bieber has 111 million followers as of 26th March 2020\u2014considerably more than the G7 leaders combined. However, our study demonstrated that the number of followers does not necessarily translate into more viral tweets\u2014indeed, highest number of COVID-19 viral tweets were sent from the account of Justin Trudeau, President of Canada. This is because it is not necessary to follow a Twitter account in order to view, like, retweet or comment on a tweet sent from said account. Furthermore, the 19 viral videos embedded within \u2018Informative\u2019 tweets attracted a total of 12.4 million views, indicating that the number of \u2018likes\u2019 alone underestimates the true reach of viral tweets.",

Further research could evaluate the usage of Twitter by other politicians from different countries. Finally, the threshold of 500 likes to qualify as a viral tweet was an arbitrary one determined a priori in the absence of a strict definition from the literature, albeit it resulted in a good range of data across all included G7 member nations.",
