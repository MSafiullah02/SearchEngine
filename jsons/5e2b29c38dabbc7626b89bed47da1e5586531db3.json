Since ICTV only meets during these conferences, which are held every four years, the meetings are important occasions for reviewing the classification and nomenclature of viruses. Decisions on new names, which encapsulate the recognition of natural \"groups\" of viruses, evolve slowly. Official approval for new names depends upon a series of sequential steps ; recommendations by one or more of the subcommittees of the Executive Committee of ICTV (subcommittees on Bacterial, Invertebrate, Plant and Vertebrate Viruses respectively, and for some of the larger viral groups which span several kinds of hosts--the Coordination Subcommittee), which are considered by the Executive Committee of ICTV and may finally be submitted for approval by ICTV itself. Only after this final approval does a name become \"official\".",

Latinized names, ending in\".., virus\" for a genus and \"... viridae\" for a family name, have been widely accepted. On the other hand there has been no support for latinized specific names (i.e., a latinized binomial nomenclature) ; virologists have preferred to use vernacular names usually accompanied by a precise description of the strain and antecedents of the virus used for the investigations described.

The Plant Virus Subcommittees of the ICNV which worked from 1966 to 1970 took exception to this rule and devised sigla for all the viral groups for which it recommended names at the meeting of ICNV in Mexico City in 1970. Since according to the Rules they were not legal, these names could not be approved by ICNV, and were therefore published in the First Report only as suggestions made by the Plant Virus Subcommittee (6) . To break the deadlock that threatened international agreement on a single system of nomenclature for all viruses, several proposals were made for the modification of Rule 7. That finally accepted at the Madrid meeting led to the replacement of old Rule 7 by the following: \"Sigla may be accepted as names of viruses or virus groups, provided that they are meaningful to workers in the fields and are recommended by internationaI virus study groups.\" This change allowed ICTV, at the Madrid meeting, to approve the names for plant virus groups that were first proposed in 1970, and have been widely used by plant virologists since then.",

The description and nomenclature of these viruses is correspondingly more advanced. However, it is clear that in several cases viruses that are taxonomieMly similar to those that primarily infect vertebrates are found among invertebrates and plants, although not as yet among prokaryotes. Further, many viruses that infect vertebrates (and plants) also multiply in invertebrates (espeeiMly insects and acarids).

Following the change in Rule 7, which relates to sigla, and with the assurance that the group names suggested in 1970 were now in widespread use among plant virologists, the other nine names then proposed were approved by ICTV at the Madrid meeting. In addition the Plant Virus Subcommittee defined four new groups and their names were approved. The Plant Virus Subcommittee was reluctant to designate groups as either 'families' or 'genera'; their current names accord with the rules relating to genera but they are probably equivalent taxonomically to what vertebrate, invertebrate and bacterial virologists regard as families.

However, since they are of minor economic importance, comparative studies of bacterial viruses as such have hardly begun. Work by the Bacterial Virus Subcommittee over the past four years has revealed the great variety of different kinds of bacterial viruses, few of which have been characterized adequately to permit their grouping. The Bacterial Virus Subcommittee has suggested family names for six groups defined in the First Report (6) and has described two additional groups of bacterial viruses and suggested family names for them. However, no definitive family or generic names were proposed for approval at the Madrid meeting. It was decided that the families and names suggested for them should be exposed to working virologists to determine their usefulness. A suggestiorl was made in Madrid, but not discussed at length, that names of viruses of prokaryotes should contain the syllables \"bacti\"before \"virus\" or \"viridae\"; thus \"Myobactiviridae\" etc., as set out (for genera) in the text of the P~eport of the Bacteriophage Subcommittee in t970 (6; p. 13 to 14) .",
