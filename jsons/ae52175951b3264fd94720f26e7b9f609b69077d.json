These policies are necessary to decrease incidence rates of covid-19, but they remain challenging with added difficulties. Many people are unable to stay at home because the space is relatively small; in other cases, people with busy lives to earn daily money to keep family alive are now stuck at home and begging for supports. People with extroversion trait will have their mood drained due to lack of interaction with other humans, and other problems are also raised related to disrupted daily activities, exercises, programs, and businesses. A long-time quarantine however will be a nightmare, which consequently lead to stress, anxiety, frustration, boredom, and depression, and even suicidal idea and attempts.",

The role of communicators and public health professionals are highly needed to help counter the stigma.

It is also needed to emphasize that those who are infected by covid-19 and their family members have not done anything wrong, which therefore they need our support and compassion. In addition, it is also suggested to the community to minimize watching and reading covid-19 related news that can increase anxiety, fear, and depression, and seek information from valid sources especially from World Health Organization and reputable journals. For health professionals, we also would like to motivate them in the battle of covid-19 and keep providing health care for the community with direct care or through virtual treatment models.
