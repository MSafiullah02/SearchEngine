Almost all possible combinations of HA and NA subtypes have been detected in influenza viruses isolated from aquatic birds, poultry and other bird species.

Influenza viruses attach to host cells by specific binding between the HA head region and sialylglycan that is expressed on the host cell surface. Influenza viruses also recognize terminal sialic acid (Sia) and galactose linkage patterns on sialylglycans (Imai and Kawaoka, 2012). Human influenza viruses preferentially bind to \u03b12,6-linked Sia (\u03b12,6 Sia), whereas most avian viruses preferentially bind to a sugar chain ending in \u03b12,3-linked Sia (\u03b12,3 Sia). This plays a key role of the interspecies barrier that prevents AI viruses from easily infecting humans. Therefore, it is believed that a switch of HA receptor specificity from \u03b12,3 Sia to \u03b12,6 Sia is essential for the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus (Watanabe et al., 2012b).",

H5N1 virus can be directly transmitted from birds to humans and cause a severe respiratory disease with high morbidity (60%) (WHO, 2014). Fortunately, all human H5N1 infections have been restricted to people with close contact with infected poultry and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission. However, repeated bird-to-human transmission may allow H5N1 viruses to acquire HA mutations that change their receptor specificity from \u03b12,3 Sia (bird-type) to \u03b12,6 Sia (human-type), thereby generating a pandemic virus. H5N1 virus has now diverged genetically to form 10 phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct clades (designated clades 0\u20139) in different geographic areas (Watanabe et al., 2013). Such complex ecology and diversification in the field increase the pandemic potential of H5N1 virus (Peiris et al., 2007). In addition, other subtype AI viruses, such as H9N2 and H7N9, have also been directly transmitted to humans (Garcia-Sastre and Schmolke, 2014).",

Each mixture was then pipetted onto a test strip sample pad or, alternatively, a sample pad was immersed in the virus mixture. This allowed the mixture to migrate along the strip by capillary action. During migration through the sialylglycopolymer pad, the virus\u2013C179 complex was able to form a complex with \u03b12,3 Sia or \u03b12,6 Sia depending on the virus HA receptor binding affinity. Principle of the subsequent reaction is mainly based on two types of interaction: avidin\u2013biotin interaction and lectin\u2013glycan interaction. As the virus\u2013C179\u2013sialylglycopolymer complex migrated along the test strip, it was captured at the test line by avidin\u2013biotinylated C179 interaction. Accumulation of the trimeric complex resulted in visual blue and red test lines on the \u03b12,3 Sia strips and \u03b12,6 Sia strips, respectively. If a viral HA did not bind either sialyglycopolymer, there was no visible test line because the captured virus\u2013C179 dimeric complex was colorless. Excess complexes and free sialylglycopolymers were captured at the control line by lectin\u2013glycan interactions, resulting in visible blue and red control lines on the \u03b12,3 Sia strips and \u03b12,6 Sia strips, respectively.",

The reference viruses were as follows: A/Suita/117/2011 (Suita/117), a human H1N1 strain; A/Japan/434/2003 (Japan/434), a human H3N2 strain; EG/D1 and recombinant rEG/D1 virus, bird H5N1 strains; and rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D128\u0394/I151T, mutant rEG/D1 viruses with enhanced human-type receptor specificity. Previous studies reported that HA Q192H and 128\u0394/I151T mutations increased viral binding affinity for \u03b12,6 Sia (Watanabe et al., 2011). Therefore, rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D1128\u0394/I151T were generated by introducing the Q192H and 128\u0394/I151T mutations into EG/D1 HA to produce representative interphyletic viruses for this study. The virus binding assays showed that Suita/117 and Japan/434 had binding specificity for \u03b12,6 Sia (\nFig. 2A and B). In contrast, EG/D1 and rEG/D1 had binding specificity for \u03b12,3 Sia (Fig. 2C and D). Interphyletic viruses rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D1128\u0394/I151T had significantly increased binding to \u03b12,6 Sia, with binding to both \u03b12,3 Sia and \u03b12,6 Sia (Fig. 2E and F). The binding curves of these viruses were typical Sia binding specificity profiles for human viruses, bird viruses, and interphyletic viruses, respectively (Boltz et al., 2010, Watanabe et al., 2011, Yamada et al., 2006).",

In contrast, all the H5N1 strains that were isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia showed typical bird-type receptor specificity. Several variant-type strains with increased \u03b12,6 Sia binding affinity have been reported in some Asian countries (Auewarakul et al., 2007, Boltz et al., 2010). However, acquisition of human-type receptor affinity by Asian H5N1 viruses seemed to be strain-specific, which may explain why the Asian H5N1 viruses tested in this study did not show dual receptor specificity.

Compared with conventional methods to analyze receptor binding affinity of influenza virus, the test strip system was simple and easy to use: only a drop of virus and the test strips were required, without any additional methods or equipment. The test strips were shown to be applicable to a broad range of group 1 influenza A vruses and allowed semi-quantitative detection of their receptor binding affinities. These results indicate that the test strips could be applied as a screening device to monitor possible evolutionary changes in AI receptor binding specificity in the field.",

However, traditional methods for determining viral genome sequences, pathogenicity and drug resistance using isolated viruses are still routinely used in public health and academic laboratories worldwide (Kumar and Henrickson, 2012). Since isolated virus samples contain significantly more virus than clinical samples, application of the strip test to influenza virus analysis should enable us to more easily and comprehensively monitor AI evolution and pandemic potential in the field. The strip test system described here could then be applied for rapid diagnosis in the field when its sensitivity is improved.",

A virus sample and biotinylated anti-HA antibody C179 were mixed and incubated for 15 min. The mixture was then applied on the sample pad. During migration though the sialylglycopolymer pad, virus\u2013C179 antibody complexes formed a colored sialylglycopolymer\u2013virus\u2013biotinylated antibody complex, which was captured by avidin at the test line. Accumulation of the trimetric complex produced a visible test line with the color of the bound sialylglycopolymer (\u03b12,3 Sia, blue; \u03b12,6 Sia, red). Excess complexes and free sialylglycopolymers were captured by lectin at the control line. The strip test was completed 15 min after the virus\u2013antibody complex was applied on the sample pad. A photograph of the strips is also shown. (B) Schematic illustration of the viral receptor binding specificity patterns on the test strip.
