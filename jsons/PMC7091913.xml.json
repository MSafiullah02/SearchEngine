At present, the diagnosis of BOS mostly relies on PFT, and it was associated with various definitions until 2005, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposed PFT consensus diagnostic criteria for BOS that mainly relied on the presence of a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.7 and a FEV1 of <75% predicted.5 However, this is a partial definition because some patients with BOS may not fulfill this criterion. In fact, in the case of an OLD arising from a predominant small airway disease (that is, BOS), the FEV1/FVC ratio may remain >0.7; in this situation, because of lung distension with an increase in the residual volume, FEV1 and FVC may decrease concomitantly.6, 7 Thus, a modification of the NIH PFT criteria for BOS has recently been proposed.8 These spirometric profiles generate two different populations of patients with BOS that have not been compared before.",

It has also been suggested that the presence of clinical symptoms in BOS patients who did not have airflow obstruction systematically detected on PFT was related to a poor prognosis.3 Consistent with Dudek et al.,11 we found no association between the value of FEV1 at diagnosis and the outcome of the BOS patients. We confirmed that the patients who developed BOS within the 6 months following transplantation had a poor prognosis,11 and we further determined that there was a poor prognosis if BOS developed within the first year. In fact, the patients who developed BOS between 6 and 12 months after transplantation had a poorer survival than those who developed BOS after the first year; this observation is crucial for informing physician decisions. Previous studies have suggested that steroid treatment of BOS is associated with poor efficacy and significant morbidity that lead to an increased risk of infection.8, 11, 13, 14 Our results suggest for the first time that the treatment of BOS with systemic steroids is associated with a higher mortality although we could not identify, which additional \u2018lethal toxicity\u2019 can be attributed to systemic steroid treatment leading to worse outcome. However, owing to the observational character of the study, treatment decisions could have been confounded. Thus, this association should be interpreted cautiously.

            "text": "The main limitation to comparing the different studies dedicated to BOS, which are all retrospective, is the absence of a consensus over the definition of BOS on PFT. Although the NIH proposed diagnostic criteria in 2005, it is now believed that these criteria probably only identify the most severe cases. Both these criteria and previous studies did not consider patients who had a concomitant decline in FEV1 and FVC with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio caused by lung distension; however, this phenomenon is a frequent occurrence in the course of small airway diseases such as BOS.6, 7, 8 In our study, the patients meeting this criterion accounted for as much as 31% of our cohort. The only difference that we found between the two groups of patients was that those with an FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 presented with a more severe form of the syndrome. Until now, the PFT was considered to be the most reliable diagnostic and follow-up criteria for BOS. However, like Dudek et al.,11 we found that the value of FEV1 was not associated with the patient outcome, and that the FEV1 only changed slightly during the follow-up after the diagnosis of BOS. This finding suggests that the occurrence of an OLD in PFT, regardless of the lung function phenotype, is a late feature of established BOS and that the decline in FEV1 is sudden, rather than progressive, in most patients. However, this conclusion should be tempered by the fact that because of the retrospective design of our study the FEV1 decline could be assessed only in a subset of our patients. When restricting ourselves to this subset, we found that patients who died exhibited a decline in FEV1 over the follow-up. To get further insight in the natural history of BOS and to propose new tools for the early diagnosis of BOS, prospective cohort studies are mandatory. In this setting, we recommend a pre-transplant PFT and then a PFT follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, then every 12 months after transplantation.",
