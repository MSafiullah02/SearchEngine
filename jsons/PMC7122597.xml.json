            "text": "Advances in plant biotechnology in the last two decades have facilitated production of recombinant proteins in plants, including subunit vaccine antigens. Several good review articles (Rybicki 2009; Streatfield 2006; Thanavala et al. 2006; Yusibov and Rabindran 2008) have summarized much of this work and have focused attention on the utility of plants for subunit vaccine expression. During the twenty years since the seminal work that demonstrated the potential of plant-derived vaccines (Curtiss and Cardineau 1990; Mason et al. 1992), a large body of literature has demonstrated expression of antigens in many plants, including edible plants like corn, potato, and tomato, as well as tobacco and its relatives. And yet, commercial development of plant-derived vaccine products has been very slow, for a variety of reasons, as discussed previously (Rybicki 2009). One of the biggest obstacles is the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in a new technology when the existing seems adequate. However, a steady accumulation of promising data has shown that plant-based expression has great potential, especially if a few hurdles can be overcome.",

Oral delivery of bacterial antigens has generated protective immunity against enteric pathogens. However, there is scarce evidence that protection against respiratory or urogenital tract infectious disease can be achieved using the oral vaccine delivery route.",

Moreover, the inherent plant-to-plant variability in antigen content requires processing of plant material to produce a well-characterized batch of antigen that can be administered in controlled dosages. Thus, plant-derived oral vaccine immunogens will require substantial purification and concentration, and probable delivery in capsules that protect them from proteolytic degradation in the small intestine.",

            "text": "Recently, plant-based recombinant protein production has been revolutionized by transient expression of antigens in plants using viral vectors (Gleba et al. 2007; Yusibov et al. 2006). The plant host is usually the tobacco relative Nicotiana benthamiana (Goodin et al. 2008), which is remarkably permissive to many plant viruses. Expression levels obtained with viral vectors in N. benthamiana leaves are variable depending on the protein, but are generally ten-fold greater than in stable transformants of the nuclear genome, and frequently in the range of 1\u20132 mg/kg of leaf mass. Thus, the prospect of plant-based expression and purification of vaccine antigens, especially virus-like particles (VLP) (Huang et al. 2009), for mucosal delivery is substantially brighter than that obtained using stably integrated transgenes. Moreover, the high yields of recombinant antigens that can be obtained using viral vectors may facilitate intranasal delivery, which requires smaller volumes and hence, more concentrated vaccine solutions than the oral delivery route.",

            "text": "An ideal mucosal vaccine would induce both antibody- and cell-mediated protection, not only at the relevant mucosal site, but also throughout the body. The most convenient means to achieve mucosal immunity in global health programs is oral delivery. Oral vaccination eliminates the possibility of transmission of other infectious diseases by contaminated needles, as well as elimination of pain associated with injections and the need for trained personnel to deliver the vaccines (Holmgren and Czerkinsky 2005; Lavelle 2005). However, nasal vaccines are not hampered by the physical and chemical barriers of the gut. Nasal vaccination has demonstrated particular potential with regard to induction of broadly disseminated immunity (Neutra and Kozlowski 2006; Staats et al. 1997). In humans, monkeys, and mice, nasal immunization induced antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in salivary glands, upper and lower respiratory tracts, small and large intestines, and most notably male and female reproductive tracts (Harandi et al. 2003; Imaoka et al. 1998; Kozlowski et al. 2002; Rudin et al. 1999; Staats et al. 1997). In addition, the nasal route of immunization can induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in distant mucosal tissues including the female reproductive tract (Gallichan and Rosenthal 1998). In both humans and mice, nasal immunization has produced greater systemic antibody responses than other mucosal immunization routes (Kozlowski et al. 1997, 2002; Staats et al. 1997). Kunkel and Butcher (2002) provided evidence from na\u00efve human vaccine recipients that mucosal immunization can prime the immune system for both mucosal and systemic responses by inducing the expression of both mucosal and systemic homing receptors in responding lymphocytes. Thus, delivery of subunit antigens or VLP via the nasal route has excellent prospects as a vaccine strategy. For further reading on VLP vaccines, readers are directed to \"10.1007/82_2011_140\" of this volume.",

They include stably integrated transgenes in the nuclear or chloroplast genomes, and transient expression using vectors that are either non-replicating or that utilize plant virus replication elements to amplify the mRNA for the target gene. Nuclear genes behave in a Mendelian fashion, and utilize the typical eukaryotic pathways of protein translation, processing, and subcellular localization. Organ- and development stage-specific promoters can be utilized, such that foreign proteins can be directed to accumulate in seeds (Nochi et al. 2007; Streatfield et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2007). Expression of antigens in seeds has a particular advantage in regard to protein stability due to drying of the storage tissue during seed development. Thus, seeds can be stored at ambient temperatures for months to years with little loss of protein activity.",

In most cases, the recombinant construct is delivered as DNA using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a plant pathogen that has the ability to transfer genes into the plant cell nucleus (Gelvin 2003). The foreign DNA may be integrated stably into the host nuclear chromosomal DNA by non-homologous recombination at random sites, although some work suggests that transcriptionally active sites may be preferentially targeted. The transferred DNA may also reside in the nucleus without integration for several days, and can thus act as a template for transcription to effect transient expression. Unless the foreign DNA is constructed as a viral replicon, it will remain in low-copy numbers, but can be used to evaluate expression of foreign antigens (Huang and Mason 2004).",

DNA viruses such as geminiviruses have been used to develop gene amplification systems (Huang et al. 2009). Genomes of RNA viruses such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) can be constructed as cDNA fused to a plant promoter, which is transcribed in the nucleus to produce viral RNA that then moves to the cytoplasm to establish replication (Gleba et al. 2007). A method called \u201cMagnifection\u201d was developed to allow whole-plant inoculation of N. benthamiana by vacuum infiltration with Agrobacterium lines containing recombinant TMV replicons that lack the coat protein, resulting in foreign gene expression in all leaves (Gleba et al. 2005). Recombinant viral genomes can also be delivered directly as RNA after in vitro transcription from a plasmid by simply abrading the leaf surface and applying a solution of RNA (Gleba et al. 2007; Yusibov et al. 2006). In this case, the replicon needs to contain viral elements that mediate long-distance transport in the plant vasculature so that expression is not restricted only to the site of inoculation.",

The DNA construct is delivered by micro projectile bombardment (gene gun), and site-specific recombination allows targeted gene insertion. One great advantage of chloroplast transgenes is that they are not usually subject to gene silencing mediated by RNA interference, which is a common problem with nuclear transgenes. Another advantage is that the chloroplast genome is exclusively maternally inherited, making gene containment much easier because pollen grains are devoid of plastids. However, the chloroplast genetic system is a prokaryotic one; thus, some protein processing events, notably glycosylation, will not occur.",

A clinical study evaluated the antibody responses after ingestion of 2 or 3 doses of 150 g raw potato tubers expressing rNV (Tacket et al. 2000). Although 19 of 20 subjects who ingested the rNV expressing potato developed measurable increases in circulating antibody-secreting cells, the overall response was rather weak. The variable rNV content of the tubers (215\u2013750 \u03bcg per dose) and relatively poor VLP assembly in the potato (effective rNV dose of \u2264325 \u03bcg per dose) were likely limiting factors. However, a detrimental effect of the potato vehicle, perhaps due to poor release of VLP in the gut lumen, cannot be discounted. A clinical trial using orally delivered purified insect cell-derived rNV (i-rNV) produced stronger antibody responses at 250 \u03bcg per dose than were obtained with potato (Tacket et al. 2003), suggesting that purified rNV is a more potent oral immunogen.",

Interestingly, rNV delivered in freeze\u2013dried potato tuber was less orally immunogenic in mice, due to oxidation by phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase in potato (Zhang et al. 2006). Tomato is much better in this respect, having low-phenolic content, as well as a high level of ascorbic acid that can act as antioxidant.

We undertook these experiments to evaluate the potential of these VLP to induce distal mucosal IgA responses with or without adjuvant. In unpublished studies we examined the TLR9 agonist, CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) as adjuvant because it is known to trigger an immunostimulatory cascade that culminates in the maturation, differentiation, and proliferation of multiple cell types, including B cells, and CpG-ODN had been used previously in mice by the nasal route (Abe et al. 2006; Balmelli et al. 1998; McCluskie et al. 2000). We nasally immunized conscious female BALB/c mice with 25 \u03bcg purified t-rNV alone or t-rNV with 10 \u03bcg type B CpG-ODN. Nasal immunization of conscious mice with VLP has been shown to target antigen to the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) but not deeper respiratory tract tissues (BALT); whereas nasal immunization of sedated mice is more analogous to intratracheal administration (Balmelli et al. 1998). We also immunized mice orally with 100 \u03bcg t-rNV alone. The rNV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies induced in serum were analyzed to determine if immunization had produced a Th1, Th2, or mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. Overall, rNV-specific serum IgG levels were higher in nasally versus orally immunized mice, with greatest levels achieved by nasal co-delivery of CpG-ODN with rNV (Fig. 1a\u2013c). Within the nasal groups, both anti-rNV IgG1 and IgG2a in serum were significantly increased in the CpG-ODN immunization group relative to controls. This suggests that CpG-ODN drives a mixed Th1/Th2 response with respect to the production of anti-rNV antibodies.\n",

Antibody levels began to plateau by day 57 (Fig. 1a\u2013c). The orally delivered t-rNV at 100 \u03bcg was not very immunogenic; however, nasal immunization with 25 \u03bcg t-rNV produced robust immune responses. Fecal IgA was produced only in the CpG-ODN immunization groups (Fig. 1d). In addition, the levels of rNV-specific IgA and IgG in vaginal lavages were significantly elevated (p< 0.001) in nasal groups given rNV with CpG-ODN (Fig. 1e and f). To further characterize distal induction of antigen-specific IgA, we evaluated IgA production at additional mucosal sites, including salivary samples, gastrointestinal lavages, nasal washes, and bronchoalveolar lavages. At each of these distal mucosal sites, IgA production was significantly increased relative to controls in the rNV/CpG-ODN-immunized mice (Fig. 2a\u2013d). These results demonstrate that t-rNV co-delivered with TLR agonist by the nasal route can induce robust antigen-specific IgA production at distal mucosal sites that would be important for mucosal protection against not only enteric organisms, but also respiratory and sexually\u2013transmitted pathogens. Overall, the data demonstrate that immunization with t-rNV by the nasal route is more effective than the oral route for inducing robust rNV-specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibody responses in upper and lower respiratory (nasal and bronchoalveolar), gastrointestinal (salivary, intestine and fecal), and female reproductive (vaginal) tracts. We are now planning a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate systemic and mucosal antibody responses to t-rNV after nasal delivery with a selected adjuvant.\n",

HBV is transmitted mainly by blood or through sexual contact, but vertical transmission occurs frequently when HBV\u2013infected mothers give birth. In this regard, a mucosal HBV vaccine may be an improvement over the current intramuscular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccine made in recombinant yeast (McAleer et al. 1984). Moreover, an orally delivered plant-derived vaccine could improve patient compliance for multiple doses due to the convenience, and it would obviate the need for needles. However, we must take care to avoid interference with current efforts to expand HBV vaccination in the developing world, and move forward with a plant-derived vaccine only if distinct advantages are demonstrated.",

            "text": "The perception among plant vaccinologists that a plant-derived HBV vaccine is important is apparent from the large body of work demonstrating expression of HBsAg in a variety of plants including potato, lettuce, tomato, tomatillo, corn, and banana (Streatfield 2005). The first publication on plant-based vaccine antigen expression was with HBsAg in transgenic tobacco (Mason et al. 1992). After optimization of HBsAg expression in transgenic potato tubers (Richter et al. 2000), its oral immunogenicity in mice (albeit dependent upon inclusion of CT; Kong et al. 2001), encouraged a human trial. Due to FDA concerns that immunologically na\u00efve subjects might experience antigenic tolerance after ingestion of HBsAg, the clinical study used HBsAg seropositive volunteers who had been previously vaccinated with the yeast recombinant HBsAg (Thanavala et al. 2005). Titers of anti-HBsAg in serum were increased in 9/17 and 10/16 volunteers who consumed 2 or 3 doses of transgenic potatoes, respectively, with each dose containing roughly 850 \u03bcg HBsAg. This finding suggests that oral boosting with plant-derived HBsAg could be incorporated as a viable component of immunization programs. Oral delivery of HBsAg can activate systemic memory cells generated by intramuscular immunization, However, the possibility of priming immunization by HBsAg potato ingestion cannot be excluded. An earlier study had shown that presumably na\u00efve human subjects who ingested transgenic lettuce expressing low levels of HBsAg underwent seroconversion (Kapusta et al. 1999). It is interesting to note that neither of these clinical trials employed an adjuvant, which suggests that oral delivery can be substantially optimized in further work.",

One recent paper examined regulatory T cells (Tregs) in humanized mice orally immunized with transgenic HBsAg tobacco (Kostrzak et al. 2009). T regulatory cells mediate immunological unresponsiveness to self-antigens and are implicated in oral tolerance (Sakaguchi et al. 2008). The humanized mice were immunized by gavage with different amounts of powdered tobacco leaves, and Foxp3 + CD3 + CD4 + Tregs were measured in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes (Kostrzak et al. 2009). Serum IgG and fecal IgA were inversely correlated with antigen dose, while the frequency of Tregs positively correlated with tobacco dose, leading the authors to conclude that oral tolerance occurred at higher doses. While the data are not strongly conclusive due to the relatively poor antibody response rate among groups, they do suggest that, in the absence of adjuvant, oral plant vaccines may induce tolerance, and that higher-vaccine dosages are not necessarily better. Nonetheless, much more work is needed with different antigens, plant vehicles, and dosages in order to make firm conclusions regarding the potential of plant-derived antigens to induce oral tolerance.",

Five subjects were fed 20 g raw recombinant spinach leaves (0.6 mg of recombinant virus with 84 \u03bcg chimeric rabies peptide per dose) a total of 3 times at biweekly intervals, while another five subjects ingested control vector-only spinach. Three of the antigen-treated volunteers, but none of the individuals in the control group, showed significant boosting of anti-rabies virus antibody in serum. Based on these results, na\u00efve subjects were tested. Nine volunteers consumed 3 doses of raw rabies-recombinant spinach leaves (150 g per dose) and 5 were fed control spinach. All subjects then received a single dose of commercial rabies vaccine 7 days after the last oral dose. Six of the subjects who ate the rabies antigen-containing spinach showed significant increases in serum IgG or IgA specific for rabies virus (Yusibov et al. 2002). These results are similar to those obtained with HBsAg-expressing potatoes (Thanavala et al. 2005), and although a greater response rate would be desirable, the studies demonstrate the potential for successful oral delivery of plant-derived vaccines in humans.",

            "text": "Measles virus (MV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, but developing countries carry the heaviest burden due to the instability of the attenuated virus vaccine and the requirement for inoculation needles (Webster et al. 2005). Moreover, evidence indicates that vaccinated individuals generate less robust and long-lasting antibody titers than individuals who recovered from a natural MV infection (Muller et al. 2003). Thus, boosting with a convenient mucosally delivered MV vaccine would be a great boon to health, especially in resource-poor countries. Two groups of researchers have approached this problem using plant-derived vaccines. Webster and colleagues expressed a soluble form of the MV hemagglutinin (MV-H) surface protein in stable transgenic tobacco and lettuce (Webster et al. 2006, 2005). The MV-H was stable in freeze\u2013dried lettuce leaf stored at room temperature for 6 months, and showed only 30\u201340% loss after 13 months (Webster et al. 2006). Moreover, the dried MV-H was orally immunogenic in mice after resuspension and delivery by gavage with a crude saponin adjuvant. Since no reference standard was available, the amount of MV-H antigen in the lettuce could not be accurately determined. Best results were obtained when mice were systemically primed with a MV-H DNA vaccine, then orally boosted five times with lettuce expressing MV-H. The mean titers of MV-specific serum IgG were boosted tenfold by the oral doses, while control lettuce had no effect. The virus-neutralizing titers were roughly 3.5-fold higher in MV-H lettuce boosted mice than in control lettuce mice. These data indicate the potential for oral boosting with plant-derived MV-H for humans that have been intramuscularly vaccinated but experience waning of anti-MV antibody titer.",

Although the vaccine was delivered by the intraperitoneal route and not mucosally, the antigen was immunogenic and generated serum antibodies that neutralized ten different MV strains. This approach might be developed for oral or nasal delivery, with appropriate mucosal adjuvants, in order to produce a vaccine that is more convenient for populations in developing countries.

The non-toxic LTB protein mediates binding of the LT holotoxin to epithelial cells, triggering intracellular delivery of the toxic A subunit. The rationale for a mucosal vaccine rationale presumes that oral delivery of LTB will induce local secretion of anti-LTB antibodies in the gut, which will prevent the binding of the holotoxin to enterocytes. Data from mouse studies supports this hypothesis, and mice that ingested LTB-containing potato tubers were partially protected against LT challenge, as indicated by reduced fluid secretion in the small intestine (Mason et al. 1998). The clinical trial showed that ingestion of LTB in potatoes stimulated anti-LT serum IgG in 9 of 11 subjects, serum IgA in six subjects, and fecal IgA in 5 of 10 subjects; and further showed that the antibodies could neutralize LT (Tacket et al. 1998). Another clinical trial using transgenic maize germ (embryo of seeds) expressing LTB yielded similar results (Tacket et al. 2004). The fact that LTB is one of the most orally immunogenic proteins known does not diminish the impact of these findings, which provide clear evidence that the ingestion of crude plant material, in the absence of adjuvant, could potentially stimulate protective antibody responses to enteric pathogens in humans.",

The C-terminal domain of intimin (Int261) mediates binding to the translocated intimin receptor, as well as host\u2013specific surface molecules, for bacterial colonization in the gut. Oral immunization of mice by ingestion of Int261 expressing tobacco cells after intraperitoneal priming with plant-derived Int261 stimulated specific fecal IgA in 7 of 10 mice, and reduced bacterial shedding after challenge with O157:H7 (Judge et al. 2004). However, low expression of Int261 in the transgenic tobacco cells limited the amount of antigen that could be produced. Using viral vectors and transient expression, our research team has substantially enhanced Int261 expression in leaves of N. benthamiana (E. Topal & H. Mason, manuscript in preparation). Further testing in more appropriate hosts, such as cattle, will be needed to assess the efficacy of this and other intimin expressing plant-based vaccines for preventing infection by E. coli 0157:H7.",

The disease is highly infectious, and the severe diarrhea and vomiting produce high mortality in young piglets. The envelope spike (S) protein is a target for neutralizing antibody, and thus has been expressed in plant systems for oral delivery (Howard 2004; Lamphear et al. 2004). Transgenic corn seed expressing TGEV-S protein fed to piglets stimulated antibody production and partially protected animals from viral challenge (Howard 2004). The truncated soluble S protein product was targeted to the cell wall instead of protein bodies, which allowed accumulation of antigen at 13 mg/kg seed, and a dose of 20\u201330 mg S protein in a single feeding. Further studies examined the potential to immunize gilts (young sows) and stimulate anti-S antibody secretion in the milk for protection of suckling piglets (Lamphear et al. 2004). Oral dosing by ingestion of TGEV-S corn by gilts on days \u221235 and \u221214 before farrowing (day 0), after having received the modified live TGEV vaccine orally at days \u2212115 and \u2212102, stimulated significantly higher TGEV-neutralizing activity in serum, colostrum (day 0), and milk (day 3) compared to a placebo group. Antibody isotypes were not determined, but the authors suggest that the milk antibodies later than day two are mostly IgA (Lamphear et al. 2004). Protective efficacy was not examined, but the neutralizing titers in milk suggest that suckling piglets would have been protected. However, the milk titers dropped precipitously at day 7\u201314, suggesting that continued boosting would be necessary to maintain protection.",

A later oral immunization study using both ApxIA and ApxIIA expressed in yeast showed enhanced protective efficacy over either toxin delivered alone, suggesting that multiple toxins should be included in a swine vaccine (Shin et al. 2007). Certainly, the levels of antigen expression in plants must be increased in order to facilitate more robust protection by oral delivery.

The seed vehicle provides a stable environment for accumulated proteins, thus the need for refrigeration could be obviated or minimized. Nonetheless, only a few antigens have been expressed in seeds at sufficient levels to afford protection in animals upon ingestion. Due to the variable nature of protein structure and biochemical characteristics, it is difficult to predict which proteins will accumulate well and be correctly folded to display protective epitopes. The generation and screening for optimal expression in stable transgenic plant lines is a time- and labor-intensive process, but in some cases may yield excellent results.",

Although the World Health Organization, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration agree that applicable regulatory and good manufacturing practice requirements are in place for plant-derived vaccines, enthusiasm is dimmed by fears that noncompliance could compromise food security. Thus, investment of funds for commercial development of vaccines in food crops is likely to suffer.",

These systems provide expression levels high enough to facilitate purification of antigens in good yield and concentrated enough to use for intranasal delivery, or to incorporate into oral delivery formulations. Ongoing work to develop mucosal adjuvants will synergize with these efficient plant expression systems to provide more alternatives for vaccination and, ultimately, vaccines tailored for particular pathogens and their hosts. Agonists for pattern recognition receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptors) show great promise as mucosal adjuvants, and deserve further research and development.",
