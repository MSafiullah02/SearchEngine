NIV was typically not initiated by referring centers owing to their lack of equipment and/or in-house respiratory therapy support. At present, a protocol for NIV has not been established for our IFTs. Instead, the decision to proceed with NIV and preliminary settings was made following discussion with the pediatric intensivist and transport team and following appropriate observation of respiratory symptom improvement. In addition, an approach to escalation of settings during transport was discussed, with the most common triggers being increased oxygen requirements or work of breathing. Blood gas analyses were routinely performed prior to initiation of NIV or HFNC, but end tidal CO2 was not, because interface leaks led to unreliable trends or to inability to measure with certain modes.",

There was also one case of bag valve mask use which was required due to an equipment issue, but NIV was replaced without incident once the issue was resolved. An overall improvement of TRAP scores during transport suggests that vital signs and clinical status are grossly stabilized. Together, these results highlight the importance of an experienced transport team capable of appropriately selecting patients and promptly recognizing and responding to complications.

Although this percentage may seem large, patients typically were intubated later (mean 57 hours post PICU admission) and required longer ventilator times (mean 8 days), which perhaps suggests disease progression rather than a failure of NIV. At the very least, questions of what percentages are acceptable need to be considered. With a more aggressive strategy of instrumenting airways be employed, several patients could have been unnecessarily supported with CMV and exposed to its associated risks, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, airway injury, and sedation. A recent Canadian study reported prehospital and PICU NIV use in bronchiolitis and demonstrated similar outcomes with less complications and with fewer interventions than patients receiving CMV [14]. Surely a balance exists in providing patients safe opportunities to declare clinical trajectory on NIV support, but this has not yet been clearly elucidated.",

Because bronchiolitis and asthma diagnoses accounted for nearly 60% of our cohort, short duration positive pressure for lung recruitment or maintenance of lower airway patency could have been responsible for these rapid turnarounds. Furthermore, this cohort is particularly important because a certain percentage would certainly have been intubated in the past.
