M. africanum, M. canettii, M. microtti, and M. bovis, share 99.9% similarity at the nucleotide level and are grouped in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the mycobacteria causing TB disease. According to the last World Health Organization report, 1.6 million people died of TB, 300,000 of which were co-infected with HIV, in 20171 With the emergence of multi-drug and extensively-drug resistant strains, as well as co-infection with HIV, new tools to control this epidemic are urgently required. The currently available vaccine against TB is a live attenuated form of Mycobacterium bovis, strain bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), which has variable efficacy throughout the world.2 The immune response against TB relies on CD4+ T cells, and to some extent to CD8+ T cells,3 therefore protective vaccines require the induction of antigen-specific T cells through peptides presented by MHC-II and MHC-I, respectively, in infected macrophages. The identification of MTC antigens presented by MHC molecules in infected macrophages will facilitate vaccine development to boost the protective efficacy induced by BCG vaccination.",

THP-1 cells were selected for this study because these are the most well-characterised human macrophage cell line with a defined HLA generic genotype HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*15:11, HLA-B*15:15, HLA-C*03:03, HLA-C*03:13, HLA-DRB1*01:01, HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB5*01:01, HLA-DQB1*06:02, HLA-DQB1*05:01, HLA-DPB1*04:02 and HLA-DQP1*02:01 (Supplementary Table 1 for allelic details), which is required for peptide binding prediction analysis once peptides have been identified. To overcome the ability of pathogenic mycobacteria to downregulate antigen processing and presentation, we stimulated cells with a cytokine mix to induce higher MHC class-II presentation, immunoprecipitated both MHC-I and MHC-II-peptide bound complexes and analysed by mass spectrometry, leading to the identification of mycobacterial peptides presented by both MHC-I and MHC-II. We have successfully identified 94 mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC-II and 43 presented by MHC-I, from 76 and 41 antigens, respectively. We have mapped the gene expression of BCG in infected macrophages and correlated the expression of the antigens identified with the global gene expression pattern in vivo. Finally, three antigens were selected, expressed in viral vectors and evaluated as vaccine candidates in a murine aerosol M.tb challenge experiment. The three candidate antigens, when delivered as viral vectors to boost previous BCG vaccination, conferred significant protection in the lungs and spleen of mice when administered in combination compared to BCG alone. This demonstrates proof-of-concept for this unbiased approach to identify new candidate antigens required for TB vaccine development.",

To overcome this, we developed a cytokine cocktail to improve the expression of MHC-II molecules at the surface of infected macrophages. Interleukin-10 (IL10) is secreted by macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria18 and likely acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule reducing antigen processing and presentation. IFN\u03b3 has been shown to improve gene expression of MHC-II genes in infected THP-1 cells.17 TNF\u03b1 is important in the control of TB through diverse mechanisms including macrophage activation and granuloma formation.19 We tested the effect of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and anti-IL10 antibodies, alone or in combination to enhance MHC-II presentation in macrophages infected with BCG, and we were able to improve MHC-II but not MHC-I presentation (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). We observed that IFN\u03b3 alone was able to induce higher expression of HLA-DR but combining with other cytokines did not produce a synergistic effect. Furthermore, as live mycobacteria are known to actively block antigen processing and presentation17,18 we also treated macrophages with heat-killed BCG-GFP (HK-BCG). For the third and fourth experiments, we prepared six samples, three of which were stimulated with cytokine cocktail containing IFN\u03b3 to improve MHC-II expression and anti-IL10 to prevent the reduced antigen processing and presentation caused by mycobacterial infection, and three of which were left untreated. The three samples in each of these groups were then infected with live BCG-GFP, treated with HK-BCG or left uninfected. In the third experiment each sample was composed of 5 \u00d7 107 cells while in the fourth experiment each sample contained 5 \u00d7 108 cells.

BCG-derived peptides were further selected based on their amino acid length. From a total of 82 MHC-I and 166 MHC-II BCG unique peptides, all MHC-I BCG peptides were 8\u201315 amino acids and all MHC-II BCG peptides were 8\u201325 amino acids in length, (Fig. 1d). False positive sequences were excluded and 59 MHC-I and 105 MHC-II BCG peptide sequences were further analysed (Fig. 1d). These sequences were further Blast analysed using the DeBosT script developed for this study. Moreover, the amino acids leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) are isomers, which are indistinguishable from each other in our mass spectrometry protocol. All peptides were blasted for all possible combinations of I and L, and when a combination matched a human peptide, the sequence was excluded.

That study identified three nested sequences of the isoniazid inducible gene protein iniB from M.tb (Rv0341) through pan-HLA class-I immunoprecipitation (Rv034133\u201342,GLIDIAPHQI; Rv034133\u201344, GLIDIAPHQISS; Rv034133\u201345, GLIDIAPHQISSV).13 The same nested sequence was identified 15 years later as an M.tb peptide associated with soluble HLA-E (Rv034133\u201347, GLIDIAPHQISSVAA).14 We have identified Isoniazid inducible gene protein iniC peptide sequence iniC191\u2013200 QIGGLVGGSV in two experiments (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the Rv0341 (iniB) protein shares 27.96% identity with iniC, and the sequence iniC191\u2013200 has five amino acids in common with Rv0341. Although we have not identified peptides from iniB, we found peptides from iniC, suggesting that this family (encoded in an iniBAC operon) may be co-expressed. These genes were highly expressed by MTC bacteria in infected macrophages.33 Even though the antigen alone did not confer protection compared to BCG, significance was obtained when in combination with other antigens (Fig. 4).",

This 540 amino acid long antigen, activates dendritic cells51 and macrophages through the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signalling pathway52 and induces strong CD4+ T cell responses.47 Due to high conservation between human and mycobacterial heat shock proteins, peptides presented by MHC molecules might induce cross-reactivity of T cells that would break tolerance that could lead to autoimmunity.53 Therefore, GroL2 epitopes should be carefully considered when designing vaccines against TB, even though they are presented by MHC-II molecules in infected macrophages.",

In fact, a higher response of the peptide pool in M.tb latently infected individuals may reflect the contribution of the BCG_3870c4-12 LAASLLSRV peptide, as it showed a significantly higher response in PBMC from HLA-matched latently infected individuals compared to patients with TB disease. Also, the groL261\u201375 LEDPYEKIGAELVKE peptide showed a high response in PBMC from HLA-matched, latently infected individuals. These responses with the single peptides may result in a higher overall response in HLA-matched, latently infected individuals against a pool of peptides. The contribution of the groL2 and BCG_3870 peptides may have hindered the effect of the other individual peptides on the pool. Interestingly, the single peptides fbpA44\u201351 FSRPGLPV and BCG_3870c4\u201312 LAASLLSRV, showed a significantly higher response in PBMC from HLA-matched, BCG-vaccinated volunteers compared to non-HLA-matched, M.tb infected subjects and subjects with TB disease, suggesting potential recognition of these epitopes by BCG-vaccinated individuals.",
