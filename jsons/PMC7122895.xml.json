It was first discovered in 1883 in sewer workers, as the pathogen is commonly spread by rodent urine in stagnant water. The clinical syndrome of renal failure, jaundice, and thrombocytopenia was described by Adolf Weil (1848\u20131916) in 1886 [1]. The Leptospira spirochete resides in the renal tubules of chronically infected animal hosts who do not display symptoms of illness, and bacteria are shed in the urine. They survive in surface fresh water for months to years. Rodents often spread disease in urban areas, but dogs and livestock can also be infected.",

Of existing diagnostic tests, the microcapsule agglutination test (MAT) is considered to be the gold standard. However, the test requires the maintenance of live Leptospira cultures and technical expertise, and may take several days to result [5], which is often not practical in areas of the world most affected by leptospirosis. In addition, the MAT does not differentiate between past infection and active infection or between different serovars of Leptospira. The lateral flow test and latex agglutination test are older immunoassays routinely used to detect Leptospira-specific antibodies, but they are less specific than the MAT [5]. PCR-based tests have also been developed to help distinguish between different serovars of Leptospira, but they are similarly infeasible in countries with limited resources.",

Vaccination for pets is available in the USA, but it does not prevent the spread of the pathogen to humans. Prophylactic medication for travelers was proven to be effective in a study of US soldiers stationed in Panama. Of the 940 soldiers enrolled in the blinded study, 0.2% of those who took 200 mg of doxycycline weekly developed leptospirosis, compared with 4.2% in the placebo group [6]. Similar studies have been attempted in endemic regions without a statistically significant difference between placebo and prophylaxis groups. The WHO officially recommends that travelers who are going to a region affected by natural disasters and likely contaminated fresh water receive doxycycline prophylaxis [1].",

Studies of Leptospira isolates from several of the most commonly affected regions in the world identified no instances of doxycycline or tetracycline resistance, although higher MICs were noted with Leptospira strains from Egypt. Leptospira is susceptible in vitro to most penicillins, macrolides, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Severe leptospirosis often is treated with intravenous penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin, but treatment may be complicated by the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, similar to that associated with other spirochete infections including syphilis and relapsing fever [7]. Studies of serologic biomarkers in leptospirosis patients have shown that cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and PTX3 may be positively correlated with mortality from the infection [8], but the use of these prognostic tests is not yet validated.Key Points/PearlsConsider leptospirosis as a potential diagnosis in a returning traveler with fever, myalgia (calf, spinal, and abdominal muscles), arthralgia, conjunctival suffusions, and sometimes a rash, diarrhea, and/or jaundice, the CBC may show leukocytosis or a left shift, thrombocytopenia; hyperbilirubinemia without significant transaminitis is present in most patients.Leptospirosis is a zoonotic pathogen that poses a significant health risk to native populations of and travelers to endemic regions and is contracted by exposure of mucous membranes or skin breaks indirectly to freshwater contaminated by animal urine or directly to infected animals (especially rodents, dogs, and cattle).Severe jaundice and acute renal injury are poor prognostic indicators of outcome in severe leptospirosis (Weil disease), and bleeding may be prominent (skin, GI, and lungs).Pulmonary hemorrhage and ARDS are seen in severe cases, sometimes without icterus.MAT is the reference standard test for diagnosis of leptospirosis; testing capabilities for leptospirosis are limited in endemic regions.Leptospirosis can be prevented in travelers by avoiding exposure to contaminated freshwater and taking doxycycline weekly when this is unavoidable (such as after flooding).Empiric treatment of mild leptospirosis is a course of oral doxycycline.Severe leptospirosis should be treated in hospital with intravenous penicillin or a cephalosporin.\n",
