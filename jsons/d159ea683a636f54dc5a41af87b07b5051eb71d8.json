It is widely accepted that the quality of cryoEM maps varies locally; therefore, the evaluation of the maps-derived structural models must be done locally as well. In this article, a method for the local analysis of the map-tomodel fit is presented. The algorithm uses a comparison of two local resolution maps. The first is the local FSC (Fourier shell correlation) between the full map and the model, while the second is calculated between the half maps normally used in typical single particle analysis workflows. We call the new quality measure \"FSC-Q\", and it is a quantitative estimation of how much of the model is supported by the signal content of the map. Furthermore, we show that FSC-Q may be helpful to avoid overfitting. It can be used to complement other methods, such as the Q-score method that estimates the resolvability of atoms.",

The quality of the maps is usually expressed in terms of a resolution measure. The typical resolution measure reported is based on a threshold in the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curve between two independent reconstructions (Harauz and van Heel, 1986) . The agreement of a model with a map can be done in a similar way by calculating the FSC between the experimental map and a map calculated from the model. However, it is well known that the quality of a reconstruction depends on the region of the macromolecule and the resolution must be calculated locally (Cardone et al., 2013 , Kucukelbir et al., 2014 , Vilas et al., 2018 , Ramirez-Aportela et al., 2019 , and even directionally (Tan et al., 2017 .

The key difference with previously proposed methods is that we objectively and quantitatively estimate the specific parts of the model that are truly supported by the map on the bases of its local resolution. The rational of the method is based on the differences between local resolution values calculated with blocres (Cardone et al., 2013) , considering the appropriate statistics to make each of the comparisons meaningful. The process involves the subtraction of the local resolution map between the final full map and the map generated from the atomic model, from the local resolution map between the two half-maps (where a half-map refers to a map reconstructed from half of the data set). This latter subtraction, when properly statistically scaled, provides an estimation of the signal content of the map itself, that is then compared with the signal content implied in the fitting of the structural model. When the fitting would require a signal content that, simply, is not present in the experimental data, FSC-Q flags it, providing in this way very objective information on how the structural model is supported, or not, by the local resolvability (the local resolution) present in the experimental map. It reveals potential modelling errors as well as poorly defined parts of models. The approach is conceptually simple, fully objective and quantitative, and lends itself very well to decisionmaking in a meta (or multi) criteria approach .",

Our method is a significant extension of the map-to-model FSC calculation that is commonly used to assess goodness-of-fit (Lyumkis, 2019) , since it explicitly introduces locality. Here we calculate the map-tomodel local FSC and compare it with the half-maps local FSC. Differences between them allow us to select an objective signal threshold so that we can identify those areas where the model disagrees with the consistent signal on the half maps.",

Overfitting is one of the main challenges during model refinement and new metrics to detect it are needed (Lawson et al., 2020) . The Q-score has been indicated by the authors (Pintilie et al., 2020) that is particularly sensitive to overfitting. Furthermore, we have shown that our method has less dependence on sharpening than the map Q-score and that they complement each other to better estimate the resolvability of atoms. Indeed, the combination of these (and other) methods probably will lead to meta validation measurements where the combination of methods as \"orthogonal\" as possible will lead to new simple metrics, yet to be explored, which could be directly incorporated into modeling workflows.",

            "text": ") there are very subtle modifications and short side chains errors such as SER and GLN; finally, in the third block (Figure 1E) we show cases in which the modified rotamers overlap with other densities. In all cases the FSC-Q of the side chain increased compared to the original rotamer. This shows that even subtle changes such as aromatic ring rotation of the PHE-35 or side chain rotation of the SER-105 can indeed be detected by our method.Furthermore, we analyzed the recent structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the closed state (emd-21452), using half-maps kindly provided by Prof. David Veesler(Walls et al., 2020). Two refined models were obtained from the repository of Prof. Andrea Thorn at https://github.com/thornlab/coronavirus_structural_task_force, the one proposed by the authors and a model corrected using ISOLDE(Croll, 2018). As expected, the corrected model as a whole has a lower average FSC-Q (FSC-Q = 0.96) compared to the original model (FSC-Q = 0.99). Furthermore, our method identified some regions, such as amino acids LEU-533 to VAL-534 and THR-323 to GLU-324,",

From that point on, it begins to grow abruptly with the increase in the B-factor. This result indicates that as over-sharpening increases, FSC-Q increases. On the other hand, the charts show an increase in the Qscore, which reaches the maximum for a B-factor of -100, with a difference of 0.053 with respect to the unsharpened map.
