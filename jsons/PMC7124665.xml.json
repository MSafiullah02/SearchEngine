            "text": "There is still no proven therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The protocol reported by Loletta So and colleagues1 emphasised the combination use of ribavirin and high-dose cortico-steroid. However, if given very early in the course of the disease, this approach could suppress the generation of host immunity to the novel coronavirus. We observed a biphasic pattern of illness in SARS and postulated that the first stage represents a viraemic phase and the second phase is an immune phase.2 Acute respiratory distress syndrome seems to be a complication in the second phase.2 If this hypothesis is true, antiviral agents will be most beneficial in the first phase, whereas corticosteroids should be delayed until the onset of the second phase to maximise benefit and keep the negative effects of immune suppression to a minimum.",

One oral 2000 mg loading dose of ribavirin was given to patients as soon as they received medical attention, followed by 600 mg ribavirin twice daily for patients with a bodyweight greater than 75 kg or 1000 mg daily for those with a bodyweight of 75 kg or less (400 mg in morning, 600 mg in evening) for 10 days. For patients who developed pneumonia, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg daily for 5 days) was started on day 8 of fever or later. If rapid deterioration occurred before day 8, steroid treatment was started upon development of dyspnoea. If respiratory distress was not responsive to this dose, 500 mg methylprednisolone daily for 3 days was given. Upon improvement, the dose of steroid was tapered off over the next 2 weeks as recovery warranted.",

All 17 health-care workers received our treatment protocol (table\n). The median starting day of ribavirin was day 2 of fever (range 1\u20137 days). Only one health-care worker needed subsequent intubation and respiratory support. All 17 individuals recovered without major sequelae or subsequent relapse. With prompt identification and early treatment, mortality from SARS can be avoided among previously healthy health-care workers.",
