It is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA of ca. 28 kb (Lee, 2015, Sung et al., 2015, Oka et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2014, Masters, 2006). PEDV infects the epithelial cells lining the small intestine of pigs and causes severe diarrhea, resulting in fatal dehydration in piglets (Lee, 2015, Liu et al., 2015, Song and Park, 2012).",

In the US, PEDV was first detected in May 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013), and a huge outbreak of PED occurred in the US thereafter. By the end of April 2014, the outbreak had spread to 30 US states, causing the death of ca. 8 million pigs, most of which were piglets. The infection subsequently spread throughout North America, including Canada and Mexico (Vlasova et al., 2014). In October 2013, an outbreak of PED occurred in Japan after a 7-year absence. PED has affected more than 1000 farms throughout Japan, causing the deaths of \u223c440,000 piglets (Masuda et al., 2015), despite vaccination of pig herds nationwide.",

Even though PED first emerged in Europe, PED outbreaks have become more serious issue in Asian countries, and therefore different kinds of PEDV vaccines have been developed in Asia. In China, CV777-attenuated or \u2212inactivated vaccines have been regularly used. Inactivated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (Ma et al., 1995) and attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (Tong et al., 1999) are available. Two South Korean virulent PEDV strains were also attenuated by the cell-culture adaptation and used as live or killed vaccine (Lee, 2015, Kweon et al., 1999). In Japan two different live vaccines are available, both of which belong to group I virus. These vaccines were made by attenuation of the virulence by serial passages through Vero cells (Lee, 2015, Sato et al., 2011). In spite of the vaccination, PED is prevalent in many Asian countries.",

We first isolated two PEDV strains from infected piglet intestines, which were designated Tochigi (LC144542) and Nagasaki (LC144543). These viruses were found to be phylogenetically similar to newly isolated US strains (group II) and different from CV777 and other strains classified in group I. A neutralization test (NT) showed no significant difference in antigenicity between our new isolates and a group I strain using a number of sera samples collected from pigs vaccinated with group I virus. Our results suggest that the PED outbreak in Japan was not caused by inefficient vaccination, but by the high virulence of newly circulating viruses.",

            "text": "We obtained specimens (feces and small intestines) from piglets infected by PEDV in 2014 from several prefectures in Japan and used 14 specimens PCR-positive for the PEDV N and S genes (data not shown). Seven samples were diarrheic feces, and the other seven were small intestines from piglets. We failed to isolate the virus from feces but successfully isolated two viruses from intestines obtained from Tochigi and Nagasaki prefectures. To isolate the virus, we used Vero-KY5 cells (Vero) (Suzuki et al., 2015), which were kindly provided by the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), Japan. Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml) and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB, Difco, Detroit, MI, USA). The transparent parts of the small intestine, indicating infection with PEDV, 10\u201315 cm in length, were filled with 5\u201310 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and massaged gently to detach infected epithelial cells. PBS was collected, homogenized using a glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris. The supernatants were filtered through a 450 nm pore-size filter to remove contaminating bacteria. Diarrheic feces were diluted 10-fold with PBS and treated in the same manner as the intestines, described above. These samples were inoculated onto Vero cells prepared in 24-well plates by spinoculation, as described previously (Watanabe et al., 2006). Briefly, Vero cells seeded at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 105 per well in a 24-well culture plate (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were inoculated with 50 \u03bcl filtered samples and 400 \u03bcl DMEM per well. The plates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and then at 3000 rpm for 1 h at 24 \u00b0C. Then, cells were incubated with 0.5 ml DMEM supplemented with 5% TPB and trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml), and cytopathic effects were monitored during incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 days. We also tried to isolate PEDV by conventional method, i.e., we inoculated specimens onto Vero cells and let the virus adsorb cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and cultured the inoculated cells for 4\u20135 days in the presence of trypsin, Two PEDVs were isolated by spinoculation but not by conventional method, one from Tochigi and the other from Nagasaki. Both viruses produced syncytia in Vero cells, although the syncytia were smaller than those generated by the vaccine type MK strain, which is adapted to Vero cells (Kusanagi et al., 1992) (Fig. 1\nA\u2013C). Syncytial cells contained viral-specific antigen, as revealed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1E\u2013G). The initial homogenate of the specimens, from which the virus was isolated successfully, were used to isolate viral RNA using an RNA isolation kit (Direct-Zol\u2122 RNA Miniprep, Zymo Research, CA, USA). cDNA was then generated from the total RNA using the PrimeScript II First-strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). From the cDNA, three fragments covering the entire S gene were amplified using primers F1 and R1, F2 and R2 as well as F3 and R3 (Table 1\n). The PCR products were purified using the NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and then sequenced using the primers shown in Table 1. Sequence analysis was performed by Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan, and amino acid (aa) sequences of the S proteins were deduced from the nucleotide sequences.",

Forty five PEDV strains clustered into group I or II. The above-mentioned five strains, but not the MK strain and seven Taiwan PEDV isolates as well as 5 S-INDEL PEDV strains, were clustered within group II together with 13 strains detected in China from 2011 to 2012. On the other hand, the European CV777-based vaccine strain, MK strain, Korean DR13 strain, and JS2008 were clustered into group I (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the PEDV currently circulating in Japan is classified into group II, as are US isolates, but in contrast to viruses previously isolated in Japan, which are classified in group I (Fig. 3). These data are in agreement with previous reports (Masuda et al., 2015, Suzuki et al., 2015) that the currently prevalent PEDV in Japan is similar to US isolates (group II), but different from Japanese vaccine type viruses (group I).",

The MK strain induces syncytium formation in the presence of trypsin (Shirato et al., 2010, Kusanagi et al., 1992), as did the new isolates Tochigi and Nagasaki, while the vaccine strain commercially available in Japan induces cell rounding and detachment without trypsin treatment. We therefore used the MK strain rather than the vaccine strain to perform NT, because the MK, Tochigi and Nagasaki strains can be examined under identical conditions. Moreover, there was no antigenic difference between Tochigi and Nagasaki in NT (data not shown). Two types of PEDV antisera were used. One type comprised 18 sera collected from herds of pigs that were vaccinated but not recently infected by PEDV, and the other comprised 17 sera from herds of pigs that were vaccinated and infected with a new PEDV strain. NT was performed as follows. Two hundred \u03bcl of serum were serially diluted in twofold steps with DMEM and then mixed with an equal volume of viral suspension containing 100 TCID50/100 \u03bcl and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. Then, 50 \u03bcl of each dilution were inoculated into each well (4 wells per dilution) of a 96-well plate containing confluent Vero cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, the mixture was removed, and cells were washed twice with DMEM and, finally, incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 50 \u03bcl DMEM containing 5% TPB and trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml). Neutralization antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited syncytium formation in at least two of four wells. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, all sera from pigs vaccinated but not infected by the new PEDV strain, namely pig farms vaccinated without recent PED incidence, showed almost identical neutralization titers against the MK strain and the new isolate. In some cases, the titer was twofold higher for group I virus compared with group II virus. These data indicate no significant difference in the antigenicity of viruses in terms of neutralization activity. A twofold difference in titer between group I and II viruses has also been reported by others (Wang et al., 2016). Similar results were obtained using sera from pigs vaccinated and infected with the new PEDV strain; namely pig farms vaccinated and recent PED incidence, (Fig. 4B). No pig serum showed a higher titer to the new isolates than to MK, suggesting that those pigs were not infected even if the farm was affected by the new PEDV strain. Alternatively, it could indicate that antiserum against group I vaccine also protected against infection by group II viruses, and thus no antibodies were elicited by group II viruses. Collectively, these data indicated that neutralizing antigenicity does not differ between MK (group I) and the new isolates (group II). Our NT showed for the first time that group I and II viruses have similar neutralizing antigenicity using a number of sera from individual pigs vaccinated with group I virus.",

Then we applied spinoculation and successfully isolated 2 viruses from 7 intestinal specimens but not from 7 feces, though isolation was not successful by conventional method. Feces were cytotoxic in spinoculation and conventional isolation. These results show that spinoculation is more efficient for isolation of PEDV from specimens than conventional isolation method and feces were not appropriate for isolation. Successful isolation of PEDV by spinoculation could be attributed to 10\u2013100 fold enhanced attachment of coronaviruses to cells by spinoculation as previously reported (Watanabe et al., 2006).",

The huge outbreak in the US may have been caused by the fact that no pigs were vaccinated. However, the spread of PED was similar in Japan, where pregnant sows are usually vaccinated with a virus that elicits production of antibodies that can also neutralize PEDVs of other groups. The vaccine currently used in Japan is effective against group I viruses, as evidenced by the lack of PED for 7 years in Japan prior to invasion by group II viruses. It was reported that the vaccine against group I viruses increased the survival rate of piglets challenged with virulent wild-type PEDV, although it failed to reduce morbidity (Lee, 2015). In agreement with those reports, our findings suggested that group II viruses are neutralized in pigs by the antibodies elicited by a vaccine comprising a group I virus. Collectively, these findings suggest that outbreaks in countries where vaccines are available are not due to ineffective vaccination but rather are attributed to another, as-yet-unknown, cause.",

This suggests that large outbreaks are due to the high pathogenicity of the viruses; escape of even a small number of viruses from antibody neutralization causes devastating diseases in piglets. As commercially available vaccines can neutralize new viruses and protect piglets via antibodies contained in colostrum and ordinary milk, factors\u2014such as sanitation, hygiene and health conditions of lactating sows\u2014must also be important for preventing outbreaks of highly pathogenic viruses (Lee, 2015). Moreover, PEDV-infected sows failed to endow a full amount of milk with neutralizing antibodies to their piglets, which could also have led to the high mortality rate in the present PED outbreak (Lee, 2015, Park and Lee, 2009).",
