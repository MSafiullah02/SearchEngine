            "text": "In fl uenza A (H1N1) is caused by the con fl ict of interest between giant organisms and microorganisms. In fl uenza A and B viruses are single stranded RNA envelope virus composed of 890-2,341 nucleic acids in eight segmented genomes. Presently, only the virus subtypes of H1N1 and H3N2 still spread from human to human. The viruses spread and replicate under the following conditions: (1) the viruses enter the human body and duplicate there; (2) the viruses cause diseases; and (3) the viruses can easily spread from person to person. The H1N1 in fl uenza viruses replicate is within only respiratory epithelial cells. The virus entering into the cells causes complex pathological changes of the cells. The columnar epithelial cells stop the selfsynthesis of cellular component proteins. Therefore, the cells die due to their lack of necessary cell component proteins.",

These particles cannot stay in the air, but spread the disease by contacts. The contacts can be direct skin contact or indirect respiratory secretions contact, the latter of which refers to touching his/her own eyes, nose or mouth with his/her own contaminated hands. The patients can spread the virus from 2 days prior to symptoms onset to fi fth day after symptoms onset. The infection time of swine-origin in fl uenza A virus (S-OIV) during its incubation period is about 2-7 days. According to data analysis, most patients infected by S-OIV may have their symptoms onset 1 day in advance, or 5-7 days after being infected. The infection period may be prolonged in immunocompromised children or patients with severe psychiatric disorders. It has been unknown whether a infected asymptomatic person is the source of infection, which deserves detailed research. Severe cases and death cases are mostly caused by the occurrence of its complications, including primary viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia (especially group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae ). Dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organs failure are fatal clinical signs of In fl uenza A (H1N1). The average period from symptoms onset to death is about 9 days.",

            "text": "In fl uenza A (H1N1) virus is particularly prone to virus variation. Based on the studies about the variation of In fl uenza A (H1N1) virus, it has been believed that the new human pathogenic mutant has completed its genetic fragments combination in the animal body before its direct invasion into human body. The genetic segments studies of in fl uenza virus from the in fl uenza pandemic in the year of 1918 found genes similar to swine and bird fl u viruses. Therefore, it is believed that the in fl uenza A pandemic in 1918 was caused by the integration of human in fl uenza virus to a segment of DNA from swine in fl uenza virus to form H1N1 in fl uenza virus that is af fi nitive to human body. Based on the belief, experts speculate that the gene recombination of the bird fl u virus with human fl u virus would cause global in fl uenza pandemic. Other scholars also put forward the theory of twice crossing and the model of birds \u2192 human \u2192 swine. In this model, the bird fl u viruses spreading in poultry animals cross the species boundary to infect other animals, such as pigs, horses, whales or sables. Following the fi rst crossing, the viruses cross the species boundary again to infect human. Some scholars insist on the theory of viruses genes mixer, namely the well-known quick infection of both human fl u viruses and bird fl u viruses to swine, and swine acts as a viruses genes mixer (to recombinate virus strains from two different species). Therefore, the swine fl u virus containing human fl u virus gene emerges, which can proliferate in human body and spread from person to person. WHO recommends the realtime quantitative RT-PCR to detect seasonal fl u, including seral A, B, H1 genes, proteins H3 and bird fl u H5 virus. Using probes and primers to detect A-H1N1 fl u virus, nucleotide sequence analysis and systematic culture analysis, the infection of human MDCK cells by In fl uenza A (H1N1) virus can be con fi rmed. After reverse transcribed ampli fi cation sequencing and following PCR ampli fi cation Diagnostic Imaging of Chest 11 production, the overlapping double-stranded DNA in in fl uenza virus genome can be ampli fi ed. Genome degradation and sequence variation of about every 200-500 nucleotides cause prolonged existence of H1N1 in fl uenza virus.",

The onset of In fl uenza A (H1N1) is acute, with its symptoms being similar to common in fl uenza, including typical fever, general upset, muscular soreness and pain, sore throat, runny nose and cough, possible eye conjunctivitis, possible nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The cases with persistent high body temperature should be given focused attention. According to the clinical review on 18 cases of S-OIV infection treated in a Mexico hospital, S-OIV infection is a serious illness associated with death. Most patients were previously healthy and suffered from pneumonia from day 5 to 7 after the onset of fl u-liked symptoms. In them, seven patients were hospitalized at the day of clinic visit suffering from acute pulmonary impairment or acute respiratory distress. Multiple organs failure occurred in all the seven cases. S-OIV infection commonly occurs in the elderly and children and the ages of more than half of the patients range from 13 to 47 years. The age distribution of S-OIV is similar to that of Mexico in fl uenza epidemic in 1918. Research data of In fl uenza A (H1N1) indicates that a large number of death is related to bacterial infection. However, the 14 cases with complicated bacterial infections out of 18 cases in Mexico review had no serious outcomes, which may be related to the early use of antibiotics before hospitalization.",

The pathological examinations of two death cases in Hong Kong showed that the reactive hemophagocytic syndrome is histologically prominent. Other pathological fi ndings include diffusive alveolar impairments with accompanying fi brosis, extensive hepatic centrilobular necrosis, acute renal tubular necrosis, lymphocytes function failure and increased levels of soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-6, g -interferon.

Also in this report, CT scanning found early manifestations of thickened pulmonary markings and punctiform exudates in the right lower pulmonary segment, infused mist liked lobular in fi ltration. Along with the progression of the condition, large fl aky parenchymal shadows in the right lower pulmonary segment was found with involvement of the lung periphery, blurry upper boundary of the diaphragm, the blunt costophrenic angle, increased and blurry bilateral hili. CT scanning of the right lower lung found dense parenchymal shadows, visible lung tissues containing gas shadows with blurry boundaries. After treatment, the foci can be quickly absorbed. Most mild cases have favorable prognosis and for some cases, the disease progresses rapidly. With progressive development of pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, respiration failure, heart failure, kidney failure and infectious shock may occur to cause death.",

Pneumonia complicating In fl uenza A (H1N1). History of Present Illness . A 36-years-old man, complained of fever and cough for 6 days. He started to have fever 6 days ago, with a body temperature of 39.7 \u00b0C, with cough, bloody phlegm, no chills, convulsion, sore throat, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, chest pain and diarrhea. Cefodizime, azithromycin and andrographolide were administered in the local hospital, but with no favorable outcomes. He still suffered from out of breath and limited activities. Therapies of gati fl oxacin, vidarabine, aminophylline intravenous drip were given in the First Af fi liated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, but with occurrence of dyspnea, decreased SaO 2 . Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was then ordered. On the sixth day after illness onset, he was transferred to You'an Hospital in Beijing by an ambulance due to positive throat swabs. Finally, death occurred, followed by autopsy.Past History . None related to the present illness. On Nov. 21st, 2009, the sputum smear found no fungus.On Nov. 21st, 2009, routine blood tests found leukocytes count 5.41 \u00d7 10 9 /L, neutrophils 87.84 %, lymphocytes 8.14 %, erythrocytes count 3.94 \u00d7 10 12 /L, hemoglobin 112 g/L, platelets count 213 \u00d7 10 9 /L. On Dec. 2nd, 2009, blood biochemistry of the liver function found ALT 20 U/L, AST 48 U/L; of renal function found BUN 2.7 mmol/L, Cr 57 m mol/L, UA 135 m mol/L; of electrolytes found K + 3.48 mmol/L, Ca 2+",
