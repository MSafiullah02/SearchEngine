SARS is highly contagious, and by the end of the 2003 epidemic a total of 8098 probable SARS cases had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 29 countries, with 774 SARS-related deaths (case fatality rate: 9.6 %) (WHO, 2004). Before the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2003, only two HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E and OC43, were known (Lu et al., 2012); however, these did not attract much attention as they only caused mild upper respiratory tract infections in humans (Wevers & van der Hoek, 2009). With surging interest in CoVs after the emergence of SARS, two additional novel HCoVs, NL63 and HKU1, were identified in 2004 and 2005, respectively (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005), which also caused only mild upper respiratory tract infections(Wevers and van der Hoek, 2009). However, in 2012, MERS attracted more attention as an emerging infectious disease because it caused severe lower respiratory infection and renal failure, similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS. The responsible agent was identified as a novel HCoV named MERS-CoV (Zaki et al., 2012).",

Thus, it is suspected that the emerging MERS-CoV might also originate from bats. Recent studies have revealed diverse types of MERS-related CoVs in bats from Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013a), Africa (Ithete et al., 2013), Europe (Annan et al., 2013) and Asia (Yang et al., 2014). Studies on the receptor usage of MERS-CoV have also revealed a bat origin of MERS-CoV. An initial study found that the receptor used by MERS-CoV was different from the one used by SARS-CoV. The receptor may be conserved, since MERS-CoV can replicate in both bat and human cells (M\u00fcller et al., 2012). Later, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) was identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013). Bat CoV-HKU4, which is closely related to MERS-CoV, can also use DPP4 as a receptor to initiate cellular entry, and this discovery further supports the hypothesis that bats might be the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV (Wang et al., 2014).",

Several groups reported a high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV or a closely related virus in camels across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of eastern and northern Africa (Corman et al., 2014b; Hemida et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2014; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013a), while MERS-CoV antibodies were not found in other species of livestock/leisure animals, including cattle, goats, sheep, horses and chickens (Hemida et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013a, b). Consistent with serological evidence, recent studies also found that MERS-CoV carried by camels was genetically highly similar to that detected in humans. An investigation of an outbreak on a farm in Qatar found that sequences of MERS-CoV in the nasal swabs from three of 14 seropositive camels were similar to those of two human cases on the same farm (Haagmans et al., 2014). Near-full-genome sequences of MERS-CoV were also identified from nasal swabs from camels in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt, and these isolates were genetically highly similar to those isolated from humans (Chu et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Nowotny & Kolodziejek, 2014). A full-genome sequence of MERS-CoV was obtained from a camel in Qatar, which was genetically highly similar to the human isolates, and the camel-derived MERS-CoV could efficiently replicate in human cells, providing further evidence for the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV from camels (Raj et al., 2014).",

In addition, both human and camel MERS-CoV isolates were weak inducers of innate immune responses in a human cell line, further suggesting phenotypic similarities between camel and human MERS-CoV isolates. The similarity of tropism and replication competence of MERS-CoV isolates from human and camels in ex vivo cultures of human respiratory tract tissues suggested that exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV could lead to human infection (Chan et al., 2014).",

In an outbreak investigation, MERS-CoV was isolated from three camels and two humans on the same farm, and MERS-CoV isolates from the camels were genetically identical to those isolated from the humans (Haagmans et al., 2014). Another recent study showed that camels for slaughter in Qatar, where two of the earliest MERS cases occurred, evidenced a high proportion of nasal MERS-CoV shedding (62/105), and sequence analysis showed the circulation of at least five different virus strains on these premises. This suggests that this place was a driver of MERS-CoV circulation and a high-risk area for human exposure (Farag et al., 2015). The strongest evidence of camel-to-human transmission came from a human case infected with MERS-CoV after exposure to infected camels, which showed that the viral genome from one of the camels was almost identical to the sequence of the human-derived virus (Memish et al., 2014). A subsequent study confirmed the transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, but not vice versa, since serological data indicated that MERS-CoV was already circulating in the camels but not in the patient before the human infection occurred (Azhar et al., 2014).",

In addition, several investigations of MERS-CoV seroprevalence in people in contact with camels yielded negative results (Aburizaiza et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2015; Memish et al., 2015). The controversy faded with a population-based seroepidemiological survey of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, which provided evidence of the role of camels in the zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV to humans. The survey showed that seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in individuals exposed to camels than in the general population, and it estimated that a large number of young men who had contact with camels were infected with MERS-CoV but did not show apparent symptoms, and that they might be responsible for the human MERS cases without previous camel exposure experience (M\u00fcller et al., 2015). A recent study also suggested that exposure to camels was a risk factor for infection, as MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies were detected only in healthy persons who had daily occupational contact with camels, but not in persons without such contact (Reusken et al., 2015).",

Other possible routes for camel-to-human transmission include food-borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk/raw meat and the medicinal use of camel urine. Camels are an important source of milk in some Middle East countries and parts of Africa, and more than half of the camel milk is sold as unpasteurized fresh or fermented milk to local and urban consumers in Saudi Arabia (Faye et al., 2014). A survey found the presence of MERS-CoV RNA in the milk of camels actively shedding the virus (Reusken et al., 2014a). Whether MERS-CoV in milk is secreted by infected camels or is introduced as a contaminant during the milking process needs further investigation. An experimental study of the stability of MERS-CoV in milk showed that viable viruses could still be recovered after 48 h regardless of reduction in virus titre, indicating that infection could happen by consumption of unpasteurized fresh raw milk (van Doremalen et al., 2014). Consumption of undercooked meat from infected camels and handling of infected raw camel meat without proper protective equipment may also pose risks for getting MERS-CoV from camels. Camel urine is part of the traditional pharmacopoeia (Al-Yousef et al., 2012), and is used as a natural remedy for a variety of ailments in Middle Eastern countries. These practices may represent risk factors for infection, and further studies are needed to prove their camel-to-human transmission potential.",

It presented the possibility of future outbreaks in other countries with exported MERS cases from the Middle East. With continuing spread of MERS-CoV to countries outside the Middle East and to all continents, MERS remains a severe public health problem, and possible consequences of further international spread could be serious in terms of the patterns of nosocomial transmission within healthcare settings.",

In agreement with the serological findings, the detection rate of MERS-CoV RNA in the nasal and/or rectal swabs of juvenile camels was higher than in those of adult camels (Alagaili et al., 2014). In addition, a recent study found that MERS-CoV mainly targeted camels of less than 4 years of age, particularly calves, and the infection in juvenile camels manifested as an acute, epidemic and time-limited infection. Thus, delaying the social separation of calves or avoiding contact with camels aged less than 4 years might be a simple but effective measure to reduce spillover of MERS-CoV from camels to humans (Wernery et al., 2015).",
