Patients with respiratory pathogens were found to have significantly increased expression of immunity related gene biomarkers relative to those without (p=0.022) as well as lower alpha diversity of their respiratory microbial communities (p=0.017).",

In addition, we observed that the presence of respiratory pathogens was characterized by increased expression of host immune response genes and lower airway microbial diversity.

HCOV-229E was identified in two patients and HRV-A was identified in three patients, one of whom was also culture-positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophila. The presence of these viruses, confirmed by independent PCR testing, was presumably missed because HRV and HCOV were not represented on the multiplex PCR panel used at the study hospital. The fact that many clinical laboratories still do not routinely test for these viruses highlights the utility of a single unbiased mNGS assay for detecting respiratory microbes. Unlike rapid antigen or multiplex PCR assays, mNGS is not limited to a fixed number of pre-specified targets on a panel, obviating the need to order multiple independent diagnostic tests. Furthermore, mNGS permits detection of complete viral genomes (Figure S1) , an attribute that can enable genotyping, detection of resistance mutations, and epidemiologic tracking of disease outbreaks (53).",
