Based on regular EASO annual reports, since 2011 one can see the changing structure of migration trends altogether. Until then migration was mainly from lower income countries to countries with a higher income and the greatest percentage of migrants represented the share of those arriving from Western Balkan countries. After 2012, migration started affecting not only high-income countries but also all European countries with the highest percentage of asylum seekers being refugees from Syria (Fig. 4.2).\n",

Refugees and migrants are exposed mainly to the infectious diseases that are common in Europe, independently of migration. The risk that exotic infectious agents, such as Ebola virus or Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV), will be imported into Europe is extremely low. Experience has shown that, when it occurs, it affects regular travellers, tourists or health care workers rather than refugees or migrants\u2019 [13].",

WHO insisted that \u2018the health systems in the countries receiving migrants are well equipped and experienced to diagnose and treat common infectious diseases; they should also be prepared to provide such health care to refugees and migrants. Should a rare exotic infectious agent be imported, Europe is well prepared to respond, as shown over the past 10 years in responses to imported cases of Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease and MERS\u2019 [28]. At the same time, events in Germany on the weekend of 12\u201313 September 2015 demonstrated the opposite: large-scale migration provoked serious malfunctioning of both political and administrative systems including police, social services, housing, public healthcare [1]. After these events, reported in depth by Robin Alexander, the responses across Europe quickly escalated. Once the EU-Turkey deal was agreed, Balkan border closures organised by Austria followed by Hungary, Serbia and Macedonia left some 11\u201313,000 migrants blocked in the informal camp in Idomeni on the Greek-Macedonian border [24]. From the beginning of March to the end of May asylum seekers there survived in poor sanitary conditions with very limited running water, no lavatories, and insufficient food, despite efforts by NGOs such as \u2018Hot food Idomeni\u2019 and medical care from \u2018M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8re\u2019. The unhealthy and overcrowded conditions at the camp have given rise to infections and in March some cases of Hepatitis A have been reported [24]. Posters with the message \u2018Greece will offer you accommodation, food and healthcare\u2019 (written in Arabic, Farsi and Pashtun) were posted in March but the final decision was taken only on 24th of May. In reality, initial reactions and follow up to the Idomeni situation were limited since there was no confirmed information on the epidemiological situation in Idomeni, no risk assessment and no further public health measures were taken.",

The mission concluded that the level of assistance provided to the migrants by the Bulgarian Government has clearly improved but the medical response system is very fragile and not fully prepared to respond to a possible new and larger influx of migrants. The main weakness of the response system is the weak provision of primary health care through clinics in migrant centres or the assignment of general practitioners (GP) to migrants due to the fact that clinics are understaffed and interpretation services are not always available. As a consequence, the first recommendation of WHO is the revision of the National plan for crisis management with a focus on reorganizing primary health care services and rationalizing the use of available resources [27, p. 15].",

Asylum seekers and persons applying for refugee status are funded by the State Agency for Refugees. In case they have acquired refugee status or the right to asylum, they are obliged to pay health insurance themselves to access the basic package of health care to which Bulgarian citizens are entitled under the insurance system. However, the vast majority of refugees cannot cover their health insurance. For this reason, in March 2017 the Bulgarian government passed a normative act creating an obligation for municipalities to cover health insurance expenses of migrants with official refugee status already granted. After strong public outcry the government withdrew the proposed act and this issue remains open. Moreover, even when migrants fulfil their financial contribution, the number of refugees with an assigned GP is limited due to language barriers and the reluctance of many GPs to take on patients whose residence is likely to be temporary [27, p. 6].",

The Health Security Committee, which coordinates Member States\u2019 responses to threats, may act as a focal point on vulnerabilities in public health, to enshrine hybrid threats, in particular bioterrorism [12]. Therefore, there is a wider recognition that migration and bioterrorism have to be dealt with in a broader institutional and policy context. Despite these general considerations of Bulgarian authorities and the EU Health Security Committee, none of our past experience, including the data from our research, convinces us that there is a clear link between bioterrorism and migration processes. Therefore, in the risk assessment, the likelihood of migrants being instrumental in a bioterrorist attack was assessed as very low (see Table 4.4).\n",
