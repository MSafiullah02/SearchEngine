The Director of the World Health Organization officially assessed on March 11, 2020, that it could be characterized as a pandemic and advocated \"a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact.\" 1 The pandemic has led to severe shortages of many essential goods and services, presenting an unprecedented challenge to national health systems and determining a massive reshape of the commitment of hospitals and healthcare workers. As well as any other health service, a Department of Urology undergoes a deep reorganization. Recommendations and guidelines for the management of surgical procedures and clinical activities have been recently published by national and international panels. 2, 3 The development of telemedicine has been suggested as a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission. 4 Our objective is to assess the implementation and outcomes of telemedicine in a Department of Urology in a regional hospital in Northern Italy during the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.",

The authors emphasize that a targeted virtual approach will prove of greater benefit over cancellation, especially in patients with high-risk urological malignancies. 7 In our experience, it was possible to keep a relatively high level of direct consultation-about 55% of all appointments-via telephone or face-to face visits-considering that many were canceled by patients themselves. A vast majority of face-to-face visits regarded sensitive (suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy, 46%) or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection, 28%).",
