The spread through contact occur when particles from an infected person attach to a surface or an object and other people then touch that surface or object before touching their own eyes, nose or mouth. Furthermore, virus is transmitted through direct contact. The spread through the air occur when an infected person expire particles which are then inspired by other persons. Particles are expired when an infected person coughs, sneezes or through heavy breathing, talking or shouting (Tang 2015) . However, it is not clear how far the particles travel through the air or how long they are viable in the air. A general guideline regarding social distancing is that persons should keep a distance of no less than between 1m (WHO) and 2m (National Health Service, United Kingdom).",
