            "text": "There are six cysteine residues in the 22\u2010residue Lys fragment of MBTI (Fig. 1A). The Cys9\u2013Cys17 pair, forming the canonical, nine\u2010residue reactive site loop, is indispensable for inhibitory activity. The Cys4\u2013Cys19 pair, forming a second nine\u2010residue loop in support of the adjacent reactive site loop, is important for maintaining a stable peptide conformation. On the other hand, Cys3 and Cys7 disulfide bonded with two corresponding Cys residues from the Arg domain in native MBTI appear to be nonessential both structurally and functionally in the context of the Lys fragment [23]. We showed in our previous work that oxidation of a synthetic Lys fragment resulted in two active isoforms with K\ni values of 4 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm and 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 \nm[24]. It is plausible that the canonical disulfide loop was intact in both isoforms and that isomerization resulted from multiple disulfide connectivities afforded by Cys3, Cys7, Cys4 and Cys19. Therefore, the first step in optimizing the Lys fragment template was to replace Cys3 and Cys7 by Ser in order to avoid unnecessary disulfide mispairing. The resultant peptide with two conjugated nine\u2010residue loops, termed M0, did indeed exhibit higher inhibitory activity against trypsin (K\ni 6.36 \u00d7 10\u22129 \nm) than the two previously characterized disulfide isoforms of the Lys fragment (Table 1).",

Both furin and kexin are highly specific for Arg at P1 and prefer basic residues at P2 and P4[6, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In contrast to kexin, however, furin also prefers basic residues at P6 and is able to recognize residues at even more distant sites [6, 31]. The stringent specificity of furin and kexin has been explained by their crystal structures [32, 33, 34], in which electrostatic forces dominating subsite interactions in enzyme\u2013inhibitor or enzyme\u2013substrate complexes appear to be a specificity determinant.",

Replacement of the residues at the P2 and P1 sites in M0 by Lys and Arg, respectively, resulted in M1. The K\ni of M1 for furin, i.e. 3.53 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm, decreased by two orders of magnitude compared with that of M0, in accord with the previous finding that the Lys(P2)\u2013Arg(P1) combination is preferred for furin inhibition [31]. When Ser6 in M1 was substituted with Arg, the inhibitory activity of the resultant M2 against furin further increased by five\u2010fold, but to a much less extent against kexin, indicating that a basic residue at the P6 site is desirable for furin, but less important for kexin. Interestingly, when Asp7 in M2 was replaced by Ala, the inhibitory activity of the resultant M3 peptide against both furin and kexin further improved by 2\u20133\u2010fold, suggesting that a negatively charged residue at P7 is functionally deleterious, possibly due to electrostatic interference with subsite interactions involving the neighboring Arg at P6.",

Similar results were also observed with kexin. Notably, the higher the K\ni value, the faster the activity decayed (Fig. 2). These findings indicate that synthetic inhibitors were progressively hydrolyzed, probably at the reactive site, by the enzyme during prolonged incubation. An M4 cleaved by furin was purified and sequenced, and the results indeed confirmed the hydrolysis of the P1\u2013P1\u2032 peptide bond (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Numerous studies suggest that conformational rigidity in the reactive site loop region of a peptide/protein inhibitor of proteases is a key to proteolytic resistance. Destabilization of the reactive site loop invariably converts an otherwise strong inhibitor to a good substrate for the same enzyme. In many protease inhibitors, conformational rigidity in the reactive site loop region is partially provided by a side\u2010chain\u2013side\u2010chain interaction between P2 and P1\u2032 residues. This is clearly the case for the Lys fragment of MBTI, where the O\u03b31 atom of P2 Thr is H\u2010bonded to the O\u03b3 atom of P1\u2032 Ser [35]. In fact, Thr is considered to be the optimal residue at the P2 site for Bowman\u2013Birk inhibitors [36]. Thus, it is not surprising that the Thr\u2010to\u2010Lys mutation at P2 converted M0 from a strong trypsin inhibitor (K\ni 6.36 \u00d7 10\u22129 \nm) to a series of weak and temporary ones (M1 to M4), with K\ni values over 10\u22124 \nm. Sequence analysis of cleavage products indicated that two peptide bonds in the M1 to M4 analogs were cleaved during incubation with trypsin, one located between P4 and P3 (Arg\u2013Cys) and the other between P1 and P1\u2032 (Arg\u2013Ser) (Fig. 3C). It is highly plausible that in the designed furin inhibitors (M1 to M4) with a P2 Lys, the absence of a P2\u2013P1\u2032 side\u2010chain interaction is detrimental to their proteolytic resistance to furin.",

Since d\u2010amino acids are not recognized by naturally occurring proteases, replacement of enzyme\u2010susceptible residues by d\u2010amino acids can eliminate proteolytic degradation by both exoproteases and endoproteases. Many other options are available to tackle proteolysis by changing only the peptide bond structure, leaving the side\u2010chain untouched, including, but not limited to, N\u2010methylation, i.e. \u2013CON(CH3)\u2013, peptoid structures, i.e. \u2013[N(R)\u2013CH2\u2013CO]n\u2013, and \u03b2\u2010amino acids [37]. Based on the optimized M4 template, the P1\u2032 residue Ser was further mutated in order to construct a stable furin inhibitor. The P1\u2032 Ser was replaced by d\u2010Ser or N\u2010methyl\u2010Ser, resulting in M5 and M6, respectively. As expected, the Arg\u2013d\u2010Ser peptide bond in M5 was resistant to cleavage. However, the inhibitory activity of M5 against furin, due to steric incomplementarity in the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex, drastically decreased by four orders of magnitude, with a K\ni value of 2.43 \u00d7 10\u22125 \nm. By contrast, M6 remained a potent inhibitor against furin (K\ni 4.70 \u00d7 10\u22128 \nm) and largely resistant to proteolysis, with over 80% inhibitory activity preserved even after a 3 h incubation with furin (Fig. 2). It is worth pointing out that, compared with M4, both M5 and M6 showed similar inhibitory activity against kexin, indicating that the P1\u2032 site residue is not critical for the interaction with the enzyme.",

For each assay, an equivalent amount of enzyme was added to release 15 nmol of MCA in the 1 min enzyme reaction. For determination of the inhibitory activity, a fixed amount of enzyme was first incubated with different amounts of the inhibitor at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min, and the residual enzyme activity was measured with an F\u20104500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The incubation time needed for equilibrium to be reached between enzyme and inhibitor was estimated to be less than 5 min, as all initial velocities were the same up to 30 min of incubation. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 370 nm and 460 nm, respectively. The K\ni values for furin or kexin were measured by Dixon's plot (1/V against I) using different concentrations of substrate (50 and 80 \u03bcm for furin, 10 and 15 \u03bcm for kexin) [39]. Data from three measurements were averaged, and linear regression analysis and standard errors were calculated using the origin program to obtain the equilibrium inhibition constant K\ni.",
