As of March 2, 2020, National Health Commission of China reported 49,426 cumulative cases and 2,251 deaths in the city of Wuhan 2 .

In consideration of the risk dental treatment may pose during the outbreak, the Hubei Province government suspended regular dental treatments allowing only emergency treatments 4 . Endodontic infections can cause serious pain 6 , and endodontic emergencies are considered to be an important category of dental emergencies 7 .

Treatments for endodontic emergency were challenging during the COVID-19 outbreak, since inhalation of airborne particles and aerosols produced during dental procedures on patients with COVID-19 could potentially expose dentists to the virus 20 , thus making them high-risk procedures. Reducing treatment time and exposure control are two ways the risk of infection for endodontic treatment could be reduced. For vital pulp cases such as pulpitis, vital pulp therapy including pulpotomy or pulp capping might be helpful in terms of shortening treatment time. Pulpotomy has been reported to reduce pain symptoms in nearly 90% of dental emergency patients 1 day after treatment 24 . Partial pulpotomy using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) sustained a good success rate (85%) over 3-year follow-ups in mature permanent teeth clinically diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis 25 and full pulpotomy using MTA demonstrated 92.7% success rate at 3-year follow-up for caries exposed pulps in mature permanent molar teeth 26 . Direct pulp capping with MTA showed a cumulative survival rate of 85% in adult molars with carious pulpal exposure at 36 months 27 . For cases that required root canal treatments, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and single file systems should be considered. Besides the advantages of detecting root canal location and configuration 28 , CBCT examination could avoid nausea or vomiting for patients that may occur during intraoral x-ray examination and prevent exposure to patients' oral cavity 4 . During root canal preparation, single file nickel-titanium systems could be used to save working time 29 , as well as prevent the risk of re-sterilization. For any treatment that produces droplets and/or aerosols, Dr. Hargreaves' group 30 suggested a number of preventative measures, such as the use of rubber dams. It has been reported that up to 70% airborne particles could be reduced around a 3-foot diameter of the operational field when a rubber dam was used 31 .

This observed increase could be accounted for by the closing of other facilities that were available to treat endodontic patients under normal operations and possibly by the reduction of trauma as an indirect result of the lockdown. Reduction of outdoor activities by the lockdown may consequently result in a decrease in trauma occurrences, which was reportedly the chief complaint among patients who visited the dental emergency room of a dental hospital in Korea 10 .
