The levels of IgM gradually diminish, whereas those of IgG sustain for a longer period. In this study, examination of the convalescent plasma collected 4 weeks after patients recovered from SARS revealed that the SARS virus\u2010specific IgG was detected in all the plasma units, but there was individual variation in the SARS antibody titer (1:2\u20101:48 by ELISA). The variation in SARS antibody titer was likely a reflection of the immunity of the infected individuals. Individual variation of virus\u2010specific antibody in titer as well as polyvalency may compromise the effectiveness of therapy with convalescent plasma. Preparation of purified and concentrated hyperimmune globulins from pooled convalescent plasma should improve product consistency, at least within the same batch, enhance the polyvalency of neutralizing antibodies, and subsequently improve treatment effectiveness.\n8\n, \n9\n\n",

Although the product yield and titer recovery of this study are comparable to large\u2010scale production, these are not satisfactory for the process of precious plasma, for example, SARS convalescent plasma. Better yield and titer recovery may be obtained with other approaches, for instance, affinity chromatography or preparative electrophoresis. Further study is needed for the improvement in product yield and titer recovery. The SARS virus is 80 to 140 nm in diameter\n15\n and lipid\u2010enveloped and, thus, is expected to be removed and/or inactivated by the nanofiltration (50 nm) and the S/D technology, which is validated virus clearance methods for viruses including HBV, HCV, and HIV. Moreover, cold ethanol precipitation, low pH formulation, and perhaps chromatography partitioning can also add to the product safety. In the hyperimmune globulins, no SARS virus\u2010specific genetic material was detectable with a real\u2010time PCR. Additional experiments are necessary to evaluate virus clearance capacity of the process.",
