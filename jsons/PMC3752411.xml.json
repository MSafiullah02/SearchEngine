            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a paramyxovirus closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). HMPV occurs with a seasonal pattern in the general population every winter and spring. Both HMPV and RSV cause similar symptoms in immunocompetent children and adults and are impossible to distinguish on a clinical basis [1]. HMPV infections can cause severe and even fatal disease in immunocompromised patients 2, 3, with crude reported mortality rates from HMPV pneumonia ranging from 10% to 80% in different small cohort studies of cancer and/or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients 3, 4, 5, 6. To date, however, no study has directly compared lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) associated with HMPV with that of RSV in immunocompromised patients. Although the treatment and outcome of RSV LRTD in HCT has been relatively well studied and standardized 7, 8, few data are available on the impact of HMPV LRTD during the time surrounding HCT. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical and radiographic presentation, viral load, and factors associated with outcome of HMPV pneumonia in HCT candidates and recipients and compare results with RSV pneumonia.",

Briefly, total nucleic acids were obtained from 200 \u03bcL of each BAL or nasal-wash sample by adding 400 \u03bcL lysis buffer. After incubation for 10 minutes at 60\u00b0C, 600 \u03bcL of isopropanol was added and the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes. The pellets were washed with 1 mL 70% ethanol and suspended in 200 \u03bcL RNAse free water. One-step RT-PCR reaction mixtures (TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were prepared using primers and probes targeting HMPV A/B and an internal control or RSV A/B and an internal control as previously published [13]. The reactions were performed and analyzed in a 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 30 minutes at 48\u00b0C and 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C. Sera extractions were performed using the QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (Valencia, CA) as previously reported and provided a sensitivity of 200 copies/mL for a cut-off of 10 copies per reaction [14]. Cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads (copies/mL) of each virus using stored standard curves made of RNA transcripts.",

Mortality rates by day 100 after diagnosis were identical between patients with HMPV and RSV LRTD (43% versus 43%), and deaths related to the actual viral infection were also similar (39% versus 35%). The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate is presented in Figure 2\nA. We detected a higher frequency of copathogens in patients with HMPV compared with those with RSV LRTD (57% versus 35%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = .175).",

However, stem cell source, steroid treatment, and oxygen use were associated with overall mortality by day 100 in patients with RSV or HMPV LRTD (Table 2\n). Steroid treatment was also associated with overall mortality in a dose-dependent fashion (Table 2). Similar results were obtained when only HMPV LRTD cases were analyzed (data not shown). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for patients with HMPV or RSV LRTD according to steroid dose are shown in Figure 2B. In several multivariable models that adjusted for cell source, oxygen requirement, and steroid use, the virus type (RSV versus HMPV) was not a significant factor for mortality. Steroids at the time of diagnosis of LRTD (adjusted HR, 4.1 to 7.9), peripheral blood stem cell or cord blood as cell source (adjusted HR, .15 to .21), and oxygen requirement > 2 L or mechanical ventilation at diagnosis (adjusted HR, 3.6 to 4.6) were significant risk factors in multivariable models. Hypoxemia that occurred after the diagnosis of LRTD (modeled as time-dependent variable) was also associated with death (adjusted HR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 25.9; P = .02). Models that included virus type and ribavirin treatment for HMPV (early versus late versus none), type of radiographic presentation, viral load, or lymphopenia did not yield statistically significant differences in outcomes between the two viruses nor an association among the HMPV cases alone (data not shown). When ribavirin use was treated as time-dependent variable (to account for possible treatment biases), no detectable beneficial effect was found (HR, .99; 95% CI, .3 to 2.8). The median time between transplantation and diagnosis of HMPV was 18 days in the group treated with ribavirin and 124 days in the untreated group (Table 3\n). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for patients with HMPV LRTD who received ribavirin and those who did not are shown in Figure 2C.",

Comparison of outcomes between treated and untreated patients with HMPV LRTD in this nonrandomized, retrospective review did not show any benefit of the drug. This is possibly related to the increased time to treatment observed in patients with HMPV LRTD compared with RSV LRTD, the potential for more aggressive therapy in sicker patients, and the shorter time between transplantation and HMPV diagnosis in the treated group of patients with HMPV LRTD compared with the untreated group. We adjusted for possible confounders such as the degree of acute lung injury (measured by the degree of oxygen requirement) and analyzed ribavirin use as a time-dependent variable to account for difference of the start time of the drug between patients. Nevertheless, the nonrandomized nature of the treatment remains a key limitation.",

The only prospective randomized study in immunocompromised patients showed a decline of RSV viral load and progression to LRTD, but the study was ended prematurely and statistical significance was not reached [21]. HMPV infection has similar rates of progression to LRTD and similar mortality compared with RSV, suggesting preemptive treatment at earlier stages might potentially be useful. New antiviral drugs are needed for both RSV and HMPV, and prospective studies are needed to examine whether preemptive therapy at the upper respiratory tract infection stage is effective in preventing progression to LRTD.",

These patterns can be present in various amounts in viral pneumonia, including HMPV and RSV 26, 27. Our study, which represents the first comparison of RSV and HMPV viral pneumonia in HCT, documented similar radiologic features for both infections. As previously reported, ground-glass opacity and centrilobular nodules were very common in RSV (68% and 59%, respectively) and HMPV LRTD (59% and 36%, respectively). Tree-in-bud infiltrates were less common (18% for both viruses). A significant proportion of patients also demonstrated alveolar consolidation (64% for RSV and 68% for HMPV), corresponding to more extensive damage on histologic examination [28]. Our study correlated radiographic appearance with outcome demonstrating trends for better survival in patients with centrilobular nodules and worse prognosis in patients with ground-glass infiltrates, which represent a more diffused disease. In addition to detection of viral RNA in serum, this information could be useful in managing patients and identifying those who could benefit from therapy. Viral RNA was detected in the sera of one patient with HMPV LRTD and two patients with RSV LRTD; all three died of severe disease, a correlation previously suggested in an earlier study [14]. We speculate that detection of viral RNA in serum samples could become a useful tool to predict or stratify the likelihood of short-term survival in patients with HMPV or RSV LRTD. Larger studies are needed to address this question.",
