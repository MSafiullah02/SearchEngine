As an example, the use of a tool by someone prevents others from benefiting from its use at the same time. It is the same for a MRI scan. Going into more detail, the consumption of an apple also falls into this category but it adds finality to the good. For healthcare, medical consumable devices can only be used once for one patient. In contrast, a perfectly non-rival good is a good that can be consumed by everyone at any moment. For example, air or public lighting are non-rival goods.",

It is the same for roads with the occurrence of traffic jams. Hospitals can experience the same phenomenon, creating scarcity or excessively long queues.",

Anyone, locals or tourists alike, whether they have paid for it or not can benefit from it. Nonetheless, as for rivalry, the use of a good by all has limits. In our example, it can be the number of people at a given moment in the street. Even though this may seem quite binary in the first place, it is actually a continuous notion: a good has a certain degree of excludability. As far as healthcare is concerned, this degree is high.",

            "text": "Now, are health goods public goods? Goods and services established to give care to an individual are by definition rival and excludable, defining a private good. Yet, the specificities of these goods can lead the regulator to turn them into public goods. This can be explained by the following:The fact that some pathologies are communicable. In such cases, treating the patient has an obvious positive impact for this individual but also for those around, by avoiding the spread of the disease. This is what is called a positive externality.The effect of the treatment affects the patient but also his or her wider circle, even though only the patient was treated. It can be qualified as non-rival but excludable. The SARS epidemic in China in 2003 is a very good example. The epidemic was controlled by isolating affected people and strictly monitoring the appearance of symptoms. Indeed, each contamination of an individual had a direct impact on his or her health but potentially also on that of the people around. Generally speaking, making vaccines public goods (non-rival through an increase in the number of professionals able to perform vaccinations and non-exclusive through being free or least affordable to all) tends to curb and finally stop the spread of viruses.One can consider health as a capital that is being depleted over time (Grossman, 1972). The better each individual maintains this capital, the better his or her productivity at work. Therefore, the sum of individual health goods has a direct impact on the total production at country level. Put another way, individual health goods, in spite of having the characteristics of private goods, have an externality impact close to public goods. The cumulative effect of individual health levels implies, at the macro level, a non-rivalry (a global good health status benefits everyone allowing us all to enjoy a good health environment at all times) and a non-exclusivity (for each individual, a global good health level implies a better individual health level without additional cost: for instance, risks of infection will be lower, whatever the individual behaviour in terms of risk prevention). A 2001 report from CMH-WHO3 points out that a 10% increase in life expectancy at birth implies a surplus of economic growth by at least 0.3% per year, holding other growth factors constant.\n",

            "text": "The following assumptions apply to pure and perfect competition theory:\nAtomicity (i.e. an infinite number of suppliers and demanders for a same good): \u201cinfinite\u201d actually means sufficient to enable full competition between suppliers and between demanders. This implies that the price has not been fixed by one side as a result of market condition. It is said that the price is a \u201cprice taker\u201d.\nHomogeneity of product: health products or services are assumed identical, homogeneous, without differentiation, hence totally substitutable. In such cases, consumers can make trade-offs based on price only. In reality, there are differences amongst health goods. Yet, when these differences do not generate a non-substitutability, health goods can still be considered quite homogeneous. On the other hand, when there is non-substitutability, pure competition between health suppliers is no longer possible. This can explain the difficulties the Chinese regulator has in trying to improve the health system by setting up additional local health centres. For customers, being treated in a local centre or in an excellent quality level hospital are indeed non-substitutable. This also explains the congestion in the excellent quality level hospitals (called further Level 3 hospitals).\nFreedom of entry and exit: no barrier prevents a producer or consumer from entering the market. Symmetrically, agents can leave the market at any time. This point emphasizes the asymmetry created by taxes imposed on a part of the healthcare market, namely the private sector. The public sector is immune to this financial burden. Besides, the obscurity of land rights regulations when setting up private healthcare centres may also explain the slow growth of a private healthcare institution market.\nTransparency: the market delivers comprehensive information to agents on the nature, quality and price of available goods. We will see that this point is key for the establishment of a list of medical drugs considered as essential, including for generic medicine.\nproduction factors: labour and capital can move from one market to the other in the pursuit of better profit. Here, the doctor\u2019s status and the medical staff\u2019s level of training between the different areas, including rural and urban ones, is one reason for the inefficiency in the Chinese healthcare system.\n",

Assessing the validity of these assumptions for the actual healthcare market, we can see where the market tends to fail:The quality level is not observable or imperfectly observable. Recent reported scandals in Chinese newspapers regarding products widely praised in search engines but which turn out to be hazardous show the fragile level of information available to customers. Another story that made the headlines was about a 21-year-old Chinese student suffering from cancer. To select his treatment and hospital, he searched for information on the quality of the available treatments on Baidu. This is the number one search engine in China and it controls 80% of the search market. Unfortunately, the information he gathered turned out to be wrong. He publicized his distress about this erroneous information in a long post just before he died.4 This drove Baidu to publishing a number of press releases, maintaining that ethics should come before profit. But is this really the role and responsibility of such a for-profit organization? What role should the regulator have in such cases? Should this kind of information not be distributed by a non-profit or public service organization?In addition, there are usually not that many suppliers in the healthcare market. For instance, for drugs or medical devices, patents often ensure a monopoly situation on many products for some years. Likewise, hospitals delivering high quality standards tend to be in a monopoly situation in the area they cater for. They have an autonomous management making it possible for them, to a large extent, to set prices themselves.5 Healthcare demand then has no choice but to accept the price quoted for the treatment. Depending on the severity of the affliction, two factors come into play. On the one side, demand from patients and their relatives tend to become increasingly price inelastic:6 the health good is acquired, whatever its cost. Additionally, emergency is often linked to the severity factor of a pathology. Therefore, under the pressure of time, the price variable gets little scrutiny in the decision process, potentially leading to individual bankruptcy. This was a very common phenomenon in China before the implementation of public insurance.7 These insurance schemes address patient solvency issues, but the market is still failing, as price is not the result of supply and demand but is set by the supplier.As far as healthcare is concerned, there is a large gulf between supply and demand. Supply has extensive information about the state of the patient that he or she does not even possess. It is thus possible to generate unnecessary costs through over-diagnosis and over-prescription of drugs and examinations. This phenomenon is called , in other words a surplus in demand caused by the supplier\u2019s behaviour and not by the patient\u2019s actual health needs. This has been observed in hospitals with high quality standards and has been extensively documented in empirical literature.8 In the case of China, a \u201czero mark-up\u201d \n9 policy has been implemented for a few years by the government, in order to control the price of medical drugs prescribed to patients, with a very minimal margin rate for a list of drugs considered as essential. Yet, government price control over hospitals that have financial autonomy is tricky, in particular in the case where information is asymmetrical, the regulator having little data feedback from the ground level. For the regulator to actually assess the relevance of all procedures and prescriptions, a comprehensive information feed would be necessary as well adequate administrative resources to process this information.\n",

They can be actual physical products, like a vaccine dose for instance, but also intangible items such as mobile apps. The latter category is becoming increasingly common. It can also include services involving actual contact, like regular medical consultations for instance, or only digital contact, like online consultations.

For a healthcare demand that is considered fixed, there are three types of income elasticity. Inferior goods\nare goods whose consumption increases when income decreases: they are substitution goods to others that are no longer affordable . As an example, take medical drugs bought online: price is often the purchase trigger, as they are usually cheaper, but criticized for their dubious origin and quality. In that sense, they can be considered inferior goods. Similarly, online consultations are heavily debated as they have attractive prices but lack guarantees on the quality of diagnosis. Implicitly, what critics of online consultations denounce is their inferiority. They do not enable a comprehensive examination and complete diagnosis to be made and are substitutes for more expensive physical consultations.10\n",

Nevertheless, many countries strictly regulate this market to control its development. In France, for instance, the possibility of a practitioner or a group of practitioners offering online consultations is bound by a formal authorization from the regional health regulatory agency (ARS, Agence de Sant\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale). The project will only be accepted if there is a recognized lack of healthcare supply in the region.

Should there be any specific procedure or should they be treated as traditionally distributed drugs? Behind all this lies the lingering issue of the quality of drugs sold online. How can quality be controlled? How do we prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the market? In Europe, online sales of medical drugs are soaring. In Spain, Belgium, France and Italy, this is only allowed for non-prescription drugs. In other markets, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway or Portugal, online sales are legal for any kind of medicine, be it (under restrictive rules) prescription or non-prescription. The same situation applies in the United States. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only 3% of online pharmacies are fully safe, from medical and legal standpoints.16 To improve such a situation, some countries have established a comprehensive list of websites allowed to sell medical drugs.

In parallel, hospitals have been incentivized to modernize their equipment and improve their quality. As a consequence of this, public hospitals can make profit.
