In the past, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmitted the virus to HCPs, who accounted for a fifth of all infected cases globally. Risk factors included poor institutional infection control measures and poor compliance with the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), among others [1]. Although there are novel guidelines for the prevention, quarantine, epidemiology, and treatment of COVID-19, little is known about its rates of occupational transmission to HCPs. At the time of writing, the total number of coronavirus cases in the world has already surpassed two million [2]. In the absence of official data, our preliminary search of media sources shows that 486 HCPs with an average age (SD) of 59 (14) years have died from COVID-19 ([3], Table 1), equivalent to an estimated death toll of 0.36% of HCPs relative to all registered COVID-19 deaths in the world. Due to limited data and possible underreporting, the true scale of deaths among HCPs remains unknown.\n",
