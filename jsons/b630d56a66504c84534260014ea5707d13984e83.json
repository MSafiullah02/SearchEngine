First, hydrogen cations are generated on the cathode from water vapor in the air, and these are subsequently reduced to atomic hydrogen at the anode. Superoxide ions (O2-) are also formed at the anode and react with the hydrogen atoms to produce hydrogen peroxide ions (HO2-). These anions settle on microorganisms present in the air (bacteria, viruses, fungi, or spores) and deprotonate their protein envelope, to a certain degree impairing their biological function. The microorganisms, although still present in the air, lose their pathogenic effect.

To do so requires each step of the air quality -filtration, sensor technology, surface treatment as BehrOxal and biocide coating as BehrOxal nano, ionization, and fragrancing -to be customized to the vehicle. With this air quality system, future customer requirements can be better addressed and greater comfort brought to the vehicle interior as an environment and workplace.",
