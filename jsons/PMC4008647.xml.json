            "text": "The mechanism of action of niclosamide is thought to be through the internalization of Fzd1 and down-regulation of WNT pathway intermediaries (41). In its common usage as an antihelminthic, it is believed to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation 56, 57. It has recently been found to be effective at low micromolar concentrations in preventing the synthesis of corona virus proteins in a tissue culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (58). It is known that the function of \u03b2-catenin is controlled by ubiquitination and ultimately degradation by the proteasome; a possible mechanism of niclosamide function might be its effect on either the ubiquitination or a proteolytic pathway to cause degradation of \u03b2-catenin (59). Recent studies found that XAV939 inhibits the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) domain of tankyrase 1 and 2 and destabilizes AXIN1 and 2 by Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARsylation) (60). In the present study we showed by TOPflash assay that niclosamide and XAV939 can inhibit WNT pathway activation in leiomyoma cells. We attempted to rule out nonspecific toxic effects of niclosamide or XAV939 on cells using the LDH assay. We noticed morphologic changes in these cells after treatments. Thus, further studies will be needed to assess nonspecific toxic effects of these compounds on both diseased and healthy tissues.",

It can be speculated that the systemic treatment works because the WNT canonical signaling is highly active in the diseased tissue, therefore it is more susceptible to the effects of the drugs compared with healthy tissue, allowing for a lower dose to be administered. However, reducing undesirable side effects should always be a goal when developing novel therapies. Consequently, to avoid any off-target effects, it might be attractive to develop a vaginal delivery system, which can deliver therapeutics locally and avoid systemic complications.",

Our study demonstrates that sustained activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in leiomyoma cells can enhance activities associated with leiomyoma formation, such as proliferation. However, given that WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling controls cell-fate decisions throughout development, often controlling the balance between progenitor cells and their descendants, we speculate that cells serving as progenitors to leiomyoma may be a key target of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in leiomyoma tumorigenesis (62).",
