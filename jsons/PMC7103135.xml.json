There are likely to be substantial effects on illness and mortality statistics, disproportionately affecting poorer regions (Patz et al., 2005). The consensus now rests with those who consider the anticipated change to be anthropogenic in nature. Despite this consensus, however, there is still much uncertainty about what the future holds for wider aspects of human health (Wardekker et al., 2012).",

In recent years, there has been considerable increase in investment towards reducing the burden of several NTDs (Molyneux et al., 2017), but they still collectively contribute to productivity loss (reviewed by Conteh et al., 2010), illness and suffering in many countries, including several within the G20 (Hotez, 2014).

Radiative forcing is defined as a rate of change in energy per unit area (measured in W/m2) of the upper atmosphere. As greenhouse gasses (also known as radiative forcing components or climate sensitivities) trap more of the incoming energy from the sun, so the ratio of incoming vs reflected energy gets greater and the radiative forcing value increases (Fig. 1\n).",

They differ from the SRES family by decoupling climate modelling from scenario development and thereby allow for independent modelling of specific interventions, rather than having them built in at the onset. These scenarios are known as RCP2.6 (van Vuuren et al., 2011a), RCP4.5 (Thomson et al. 2011), RCP6 (Masui et al., 2011) and RCP8.5 (Riahi et al., 2011). The nomenclature of these pathways corresponds specifically to the anticipated change in the global average level of radiative forcing in the year 2100 compared to preindustrial levels. So, for example, RCP2.6 represents a change of 2.6 W/m2 over this time period.",

Each RCP imagines a particular future where levels of CO2 and other gasses are either reduced or increased by changes in the drivers of emissions. For example, RCP2.6 is the output of models that combine reforestation programmes, reduced methane emissions and moderate population growth. Conversely, RCP8.5 considers a future where methane emissions increase substantially, there is considerable population growth and continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels. RCP2.6 is considered to be \u2018reversible\u2019 and in the underpinning models it is suggested that emissions will peak in 2050 before returning to historically normal values by 2100.

Combining AOGCMs and ESMs leads to multimodel \u2018experiments\u2019 that project global temperature, precipitation and other variables over coming decades. The experiment known as CMIP5 is capable of producing dozens of different simulated output variables (Taylor et al., 2012) including snowfall flux, zooplankton carbon concentration, near-surface wind speed, evaporation, soil temperature and water content. The spatial and temporal resolutions of these outputs can be specified depending on need and within the limits of the available IT infrastructure. Daily estimates of precipitation and temperature are now available, for example through the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) at a temporal resolution of 1 day and a spatial resolution of 0.25 degree (approximately 25 \u00d7 25 km).

For example, it has been long established that malaria parasites exhibit circadian patterns in emergence from red-blood cells (Mideo et al., 2013), and also well known that schistosome cercariae exhibit a circadian pattern of emergence from snail hosts (Mintsa-Ngu\u00e9ma et al., 2014). Less well known is that humans excrete eggs of schistosome parasites in a circadian pattern, with peak excretion late morning (Doehring et al., 1983; Hawking, 1975). Climate change has the potential to create asynchrony by either changing host behaviour (e.g. time of faecal expulsion change as a result of abiotic and biotic pressures on host behaviour), or by disrupting the availability of hosts at the time required to complete the life cycle (e.g., by forcing a range shift). Evidence for this occurring already has emerged from studies of livestock carrying Nematodirus battus (Gethings et al., 2015).",

Ecologists continue to debate whether or not heterogeneity in abiotic resources at a particular scale is associated with diversity of organisms (Lundholm, 2009), but it remains true that microclimatic variation is a driver of species abundance at a very local level. The availability of specific habitats is a requirement for many vector and intermediate host species. For example, eggs of helminth species require specific abiotic and biotic conditions to thrive.

Small holders and poorer farmers are more likely to be concerned about heavy rainfall, but may have no livelihood response due to a lack of assets and entitlements (Cooper and Wheeler, 2017). This effect may not be universal, as there is also evidence that farming communities have adapted to harsh environments over many generations (Kassie et al., 2013; Mortimore and Adams, 2001) to include allocating labour differentially across seasons to mitigate unpredictable precipitation patterns, increasing biodiversity and diversifying livelihoods.",

Simultaneously, the demand for water for aquaculture is rising, bringing the potential for food-borne diseases to become a major issue in coming decades. Almost 60 species of fish-borne trematode have been described (Hung et al., 2013). Infections among farmed fish have been associated with aquaculture practices in several SE Asian countries (reviewed by Lima dos Santos and Howgate, 2011). Concerns have also been raised regarding potential spillover from wildlife populations into tilapia productions in China (Li et al., 2013). The encroachment of wildlife into human communities is also expected to increase with increased urbanisation, habitat encroachment, loss and fragmentation (Hassell et al., 2017.)",

The EU funded Healthy Futures programme (www.healthyfutures.eu) adopted the IPCC vulnerability\u2013hazard-risk framework to produce risk maps related to decadal climate change in the context of Rift Valley Fever, Malaria and S. mansoni in East Africa (Taylor et al., 2016). In that project, stakeholder analysis and expert consultation were deployed to provide weighted indicators that could be included in the vulnerability domain. A comparative approach to estimating vulnerability that compared the expert-weighting approach to statistical modelling found high concordance in the context of modelling vulnerability to Dengue (Hagenlocher et al., 2013).",

Consensus is emerging that extremes of precipitation are likely to increase in frequency (Knapp et al., 2015). Also of concern is increased frequency of drought (Dewes et al., 2017) and flooding (Hirabayashi et al., 2013), although there is still considerable debate on the role of anthropogenic drivers underpinning these changes (Kundzewicz et al., 2014).

Development projects with all good intentions, related to water infrastructure in particular, have themselves been associated with increased transmission of parasitic infections including malaria in unstable areas (Ijumba and Lindsay, 2001; Kibret et al., 2017), filariasis (Erlanger et al., 2005) and schistosomiasis (e.g. N\u2019Goran et al., 1997). In the latter case, concerns have been raised recently about how a large-scale water conservation project could translocate Oncomelania hupensis (an intermediate host snail of S. japonica) in China (Liang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2017), how migration of seasonal workers related to dam construction might have led to admixture of S. mansoni populations in Senegal (Van den Broeck et al., 2015), how dam construction could affect the transmission of Schistosoma mekongi in Laos (Attwood and Upatham, 2012) and prevent the migration of snail-eating prawns across sub-Saharan Africa (Sokolow et al., 2017).

A range of modelling approaches benefit from inclusion of absence data (Li and Guo, 2013) if a survey has been undertaken in the area and the absence has been confirmed by direct observation. If there has been no survey in a particular area the data are missing and cannot be used in place of absence data.

Simulations of those past events produce results that are different to observations. This is referred to as bias, and the bias is then carried over into future projections. Bias correction involves correcting the future simulations so that they more accurately predict the future. The simplest method is the so-called \u2018delta\u2019 method (e.g. Hay et al., 2000). This approach requires calculating the difference between observed and simulated climate from the past and applying the difference to simulations of the future. There are several different types of bias correction available, which are detailed elsewhere (e.g. Teutschbein and Seibert, 2012).",

From a climate change perspective, it will be important for modelling efforts to accommodate these extremely successful adaptations of the target mosquitoes to available environments. One of the key challenges will be to consider how future rates of urbanisation and climate change connect with issues such as precipitation, water collection and drainage (Moore et al., 2016; Semadeni-Davies et al., 2008).",

The dependence on environmental cues for the behaviour of the juvenile worms indicates that a changing environment which is predisposed to longer periods of dryness is likely to be detrimental. Under stable and ideal soil conditions, the larvae may live for several weeks (Augustine, 1923). If the soil becomes more clay like due to perturbation the larvae are not likely to survive (Payne, 1923). If there is rapid alteration of drying and moistening, the larvae will likewise not thrive (Beaver, 1953).",

While it is clear that the temperature and the state of the aquatic ecosystem are a critical factor for snail and parasite development (Morley and Lewis, 2013), the question of whether climate change alone will have a noticeably existential impact on the future transmission of schistosomiasis is still very uncertain (McCreesh and Booth, 2013; Stensgaard et al., 2016).",

(2013) used an ecological niche model to estimate potential changes to the macrodistribution of two snail species (Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Biomphalaria sudanica) in the African context. The results of their studies hinted at the both the underlying complexity and uncertainty of this type of projection. Assuming all else remains equal; Stensgaard et al. (2013) predicted that snail range of B. pfeifferi could either contract by 43% by 2080 under the SRES A2 scenario while the range of B. sudanica could increase by 14% under the same scenario. Their conclusion, that climate change is unlikely to have a uniform and unilateral effect, was borne out in a later study of S. mansoni in East Africa (McCreesh et al., 2015). Functional relationships drawn from the literature on B. pfeifferi were first used to model how a long-term trend towards warmer water may affect snail population biology (McCreesh and Booth, 2014). Virtual miracidia were added into the model, with the output being virtual cercariae. Using this output as a measure of \u2018infection risk\u2019, combined with downscaled climate change projections for specific RCP scenarios allowed for mapping future transmission potential up to 2050 in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia (McCreesh et al., 2015). Owing to the nature of the functional relationships contained within the model it was observed that some areas are likely to become unsuitable either for the parasite or the host, whereas other areas would become more suitable. A later collaboration that combined the ecological niche and functional trait modelling reached a similar conclusion (Stensgaard et al., 2016). Fig. 7\nsummarises the steps taken in this project, which represented an application of a generalisable approach to assessing the effect climate change through considering how abiotic changes may affect functional traits of both intermediate hosts and parasites (Cizauskas et al., 2017).",

It is known, for example, that contemporary weather patterns shape exposure among cattle in the European context, with the number of relatively warm days per annum, combined with relatively high average levels of within-farm precipitation (excluding within-year spikes) are positively associated with milk-seropositivity (Charlier et al., 2016; Munita et al., 2016). Within-country spatial clustering is thereby associated with spatial variation in these meteorological factors (Selemetas and de Waal, 2015). Enhanced vegetation (assessed remotely) has also been associated with increased risk of transmission in areas as regionally distant as Colombia (Valencia-L\u00f3pez et al., 2012) and Pakistan (Afshan et al., 2014).",

Echinococcus granulosus is responsible for the majority of morbidity in humans and has a wider distribution including tropical and temperate regions (McManus et al., 2003). It is clear from this latter fact alone that the eggs of E. granulosus must have historically adapted to a wide range of temperatures above 0\u00b0C. This has been reported by a very small number of studies at the time of writing. Wachira et al. (1991) tested the viability of E. granulosus eggs under various conditions in a semiarid region of Kenya. After placing eggs in suspension, samples were positioned on open ground, near a house or near a water hole. Only the eggs near the water hole were observed to be viable after 10 days, where the average temperature was approximately 29\u00b0C. Most recently, Thevenet et al. (2005) observed that eggs of the parasite kept outdoors on deposited stool samples from canines were viable after 41 months exposure to the elements in an arid region of Pategonia. During the exposure period, the eggs were subject to a temperature variation of \u2212 3 to + 37\u00b0C and low rainfall (< 300 mm per annum). At the end of the exposure period, the eggs were still viable in terms of producing cysts in Texel ovines. Together, these studies, combined with a few earlier studies cited by Wachira et al. (1991), suggest that eggs of E. granulosus may be viable when deposited onto the ground at temperatures not yet reached by more temperate areas.",

In terms of humidity and surface water, the evidence suggests that conditions of low RH can dramatically affect the survival of eggs. Laws (1968) reported that only T. hydatigena eggs could survive RH levels below 60%, while Gemmell (1977) observed that a lack of surface moisture reduced hatching to almost 0% after 4 days, irrespective of species and storage temperature. Similar observations were made by S\u00e1nchez Thevenet et al. (2017) who again concluded from laboratory studies of T. hydatigena that low RH values are inimical to eggs of this parasite. The inferences from all these studies are that dryer environments cause higher rates of mortality, possibly due to the desiccation of the keratin shell leading to shrinkage and increased hydrostatic pressure on the embryo, leading to its demise (Laws, 1968).",

Taken together, the current models suggest that infected bats migrate to resource rich areas (Buceta and Johnson, 2017) but are limited in their geographic distribution by a combination of temperature, evapotranspiration and elevation (Pigott et al., 2014, Pigott et al., 2015).

M. natalensis is an endotherm and as such its gestation period is not directly affected by external temperatures. In contrast, the population abundance of this organism is characterised by clearly definable and high-amplitude fluctuations. Published field studies have consistently observed that these fluctuations are predictably associated with seasonal rainfall patterns (Coetzee, 1975; Makundi et al., 2007; Sluydts et al., 2007; Stenseth et al., 1997). Typically, M. natalensis breed during rainy seasons and are most abundant in the proceeding dry season (Christensen, 1993). Specific rainfall events, including so-called \u2018short rains\u2019 have been associated with rapid growth in population, termed outbreaks (Mwanjabe et al., 2002). This phenomenon is the result of more rapid development of the pups (Leirs et al., 1990), a process triggered by the rains and the consequential lifting of food restrictions (Christensen, 1993), and leads to both parents and their offspring breeding within relatively short periods of time.",

One study has focused on the issue of estimating the effect of global change, including climate change (Redding et al., 2016). In that particular study, the authors created a spatially stratified mechanistic model for West Africa and modelled the effects of three climate change scenarios drawn from the HADGem3 AOGCM.

There is some evidence that ambient temperature can affect the density of the symbiotic Wolbachia density (Mouton et al., 2007), particularly in terms of the interaction between host genotype and Wolbachia strain. This may reflect local adaptability to changing temperatures over short timescales. A less direct effect may be possible through competition for resources as the availability of food changes over a longer period of time (Ross et al., 2016), with evidence that certain Wolbachia strains (wMel, wMelPop and wAlbB) can reduce the survival times of Aedes larvae under starvation conditions. In the context of using Wolbachia to control populations of Aedes mosquitoes, high temperatures (e.g. 30\u201340\u00b0C over several days) have been observed to reduce bacterial levels, at least in the short term (Ulrich et al., 2016). Again, this points to adaptability but tells us little about how a sustained pressure will shift the host\u2013symbiont relationship.

Aedes mosquitoes are susceptible to selection pressures as a result of climate change (see above), and may therefore disseminate due to certain environments becoming more suitable.

The macaques adapt their foraging strategy by moving beyond their home range if food becomes scarce in one particular area. This range extension could occur as a result of decreasing availability of natural foodstuffs in areas with altered patterns of agriculture, forcing the monkeys into new areas (including urban settings) where food is more available.

The potential importance of the infection was recognised by WHO, which declared a public health emergency in February 2016 as the infection was observed to spread across 69 countries and territories, causing thousands of cases of microcephaly (World Health Organisation, 2016b). The designation was removed in November 2016, with WHO maintaining that Zika was a high priority issue.

In areas of water scarcity, hand washing is likely to be less frequent. Blinding trachoma is a major problem in countries with a high level of desertification, including Egypt and Chad.

Musca sorbens, a major vector of trachoma, lays its eggs on (preferably human) faeces (Emerson et al., 2001). The larvae develop and emerge if conditions are suitable. Factors affecting the probability of emergence include whether or not the environment around the faeces leads to crust formation (making it harder to emerge), whether or not the faeces is removed by dung beetles, or whether fly predators such as the dermapateran Labidura riparia or histerid beetles such as Atholus rothkirchi Berkhardt, predate the larvae prior to emergence (Toyama and Ikeda, 1981). When considering how climate change may affect trachoma transmission it is therefore necessary to consider how dung beetles, and arthropod fly predators will also be affected. Furthermore, although M. sorbens appears to prefer human faeces, the fly will also settle and lay eggs on dung of animals such as cows. So it also important to consider how humans and animals will deposit faeces, and what happens to the faeces once deposited, under conditions of a changing climate which may include increasingly long periods of extreme conditions.",

Many insect species are attracted to the blue light fraction of electrical light and several studies have observed clustering of Triatomine species around artificial light sources, both in sylvatic (Castro et al., 2010) and urban (Pacheco-Tucuch et al., 2012) settings.
