Outbreaks were also occurring in Europe, Australia, and Japan. It is this dramatic increase, which appears to be tied to the introduction of the safer vaccine (the pertussis paradox3), that has made this infection an emerging (actually reemerging) disease, which has its highest risk of significant morbidity and mortality in infants.",

Pertussis immunization as part of the DPT vaccine was introduced in the United States in the late 1940s and, as can be seen in Figure 27.1, the number of reported cases dropped slowly over the decades of the 1950s and 1960s (with periodic bumps characteristic of the infection) to a nadir of 1010 cases in 1976. That number is >99% lower than the number of cases in 1947. The numbers of reported cases remained low but in the 2000\u20134500 range through the mid-1990s. Because of issues of reactogenicity with DPT related to the whole cell pertussis component, which became a political issue as the vaccine was inaccurately blamed for permanent brain damage among other things, the pertussis pediatric immunization schedule was gradually changed to an acellular one. This vaccine utilizes acellular pertussis toxoids, which were much better tolerated and seemed to produce a similar immune response as compared to DPT. Unlike DPT, the vaccine with a smaller amount of pertussis toxoids (Tdap) could be tolerated in adults.",

In 2003, such an outbreak10 (prior to the acellular vaccine use) was introduced by a symptomatic nurse who was not diagnosed with the infection despite a characteristic illness. The nurse had made multiple healthcare visits but the disease was detected only after a 2-month-old premature infant developed pertussis and four other nurses were subsequently diagnosed with pertussis, probably transmitted by the nurse prior to diagnosis. Azithromycin prophylaxis was recommended to all infants in the unit during the time of the illness of the index nurse. Seventy-two infants received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as well as 72 healthcare workers (HCW). No other infant cases occurred but a resident physician who cared for the ill infant and declined prophylaxis did develop pertussis. A more recent outbreak among oncology nurses also showed transmission among HCW and none from the HCW to patients.11 With the availability of acellular pertussis vaccine boosters, HCW, especially those with exposure to infants, should be vaccinated.",

The clinical course of the 6\u201312-week process is divided into three stages:1.The catarrhal phase is characterized by insidious onset of mild upper respiratory symptoms similar to rhinovirus infections including low-grade fever, coryza, sneezing, and a mild, occasional cough. During the 1\u20132 weeks of this stage, the cough gradually becomes more severe.2.The paroxysmal phase manifests as spasmodic coughing episodes, or paroxysms of as many as 10 or more coughs without an inspiration. These spasms sometimes are followed by a long inspiratory whooping sound and/or by posttussive vomiting. Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night and may be precipitated by eating. Cyanosis can occur during paroxysms and the spasmodic cough may have many complications including cerebral hypoxia, subcutaneous emphysema, subconjunctival hemorrhage, umbilical or inguinal hernia, rib fracture, severe alkalosis, and seizures. Young children and infants may appear quite distressed and exhausted following an episode. Remarkably, the child can appear well between attacks. This stage usually lasts 2\u20136 weeks, but may persist for up to 10 weeks. Neither fever nor pharyngitis is common in pertussis unless secondary bacterial superinfections intervene.3.In the third or convalescent phase, recovery is gradual with paroxysms subsiding initially in frequency and then in severity and the cough may disappear in 2\u20133 weeks. Paroxysmal episodes may return with other respiratory infections.17\n\n",

In a report of a group of college students who were not clinically diagnosed with pertussis but found to have laboratory evidence of the illness,19 the mean length of cough was 3 weeks. The only two features differentiating pertussis from non-pertussis in the study were non-productive cough and less likely previous use of antimicrobials. Classical pertussis can occur in adults and it has been observed that adults immunologically primed from previous infection were more likely to have typical pertussis than those primed by immunization.17\n",

Indeed, pertussis incidence and risk ratios rose in the three study states35 to as high as 8.8 times and 3.9 times in Minnesota between year 1 and year 6 after completion of the sequence. Currently, three-antigen and five-antigen component acellular pertussis vaccines are available in the USA. The five component vaccine had greater efficacy in a head-to-head comparison.36 Interestingly, the relative risk of pertussis was 8.57 times higher in those with a five-dose aP schedule as compared to those who had received at least one dose of whole cell vaccine,37 while those with six doses of aP had a relative risk of 3.55 as compared to the one or more whole cell group. Whether changing the balance of antigens in the vaccine or adding different antigens is unclear. In a response to the waning immunity observed following the primary immunization sequence of the acellular pertussis vaccine, further immunizations were recommended first for adolescents, then for adults 19\u201364 years old, and then for adults 65 years and older.
