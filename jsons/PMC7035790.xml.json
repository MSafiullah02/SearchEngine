Using updated molecular techniques for the detection of infectious pathogens in the lung, Seo et al.

The significance of these viruses in the pathogenicity of pneumonia remains unclear, but emerging evidence suggests that at least in the case of Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), these viruses may lead to lung injury and raise plausible concern that IPS may have been misdiagnosed in earlier studies [4,7,8].",

However, increased utilization of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, improvements in prevention and treatment of acute GVHD, the introduction of umbilical cord blood stem cells, and improvements in the prevention and control of infectious complications have changed HCT-recipient exposures and may alter the spectrum of lung injury in patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT [5].",

Although the conditioning regimens varied, the myeloablative conditioning regimens generally contained (1) busulfan with either cyclophosphamide or fludarabine, (2) treosulfan and fludarabine plus low-dose TBI (<12.0 Gray [Gy]), or (3) cyclophosphamide with or without fludarabine plus high-dose TBI (12.0 to 13.2 Gy) [10]. TBI dose fractionation schedules were tailored to the patient's conditioning protocol.  In general, our institution's standard treatment protocol delivers 12-Gy total doses as twice-daily fractions of 2 Gy each over 3 consecutive days and 13.2-Gy total doses as twice-daily fractions of 1.65 Gy each over 4 consecutive days (dose rate, 6 to 25 cGy/min). Reduced-intensity nonmyeloablative regimens contained 2 to 4 Gy TBI with or without fludarabine. Most patients received immunosuppressive drugs, usually a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil, for GVHD prophylaxis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of levofloxacin during neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2264500 cells/mm3), acyclovir, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluconazole or a mold-active triazole. Preemptive therapy was used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) on the basis of weekly antigen or DNA testing [11]\n. For those with pulmonary symptoms, respiratory specimens were sent for microbiologic evaluation as described below.",

Serum and BAL were routinely tested for Aspergillus with the galactomannan index using the Bio-Rad Platelia Assay (Hercules, CA) [13]. In addition, a multiplex quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR panel was used to detect 12 respiratory viruses, including influenza A, influenza B, RSV, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus [14]. Invasive fungal infections were defined according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria [15]. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed if the BAL culture grew 104 or more colony-forming units per milliliter of pathogenic gram-positive cocci or if any number of gram-negative rods or other pathogens were isolated in the setting of compatible radiographic changes. Viral pneumonia was diagnosed if \u226540 PCR copies/\u00b5L of pneumonia-causing respiratory viruses were isolated. Because HHV-6 is a known human pathogen and may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPS [7], we retrospectively tested remnants of clinical BAL samples available in local biorepositories for HHV-6 (n = 74).

Although myeloablative conditioning regimens that used high TBI doses were associated with IPS risk, myeloablative conditioning regimens with lower TBI doses were not. Experimental and observational studies support the role of TBI in IPS development. Murine models demonstrate that high-dose irradiation has multiple harmful effects in the lung. Radiation causes damage to lung endothelial DNA, resulting in cell death and acute lung injury, and simultaneously reduces tolerance to lung injury by promoting death of alveolar macrophage colony-forming cells, important mediators of pulmonary damage repair [25,26]. In addition to total dose, several other radiation parameters have been identified as risk factors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary toxicity. There is general agreement that fractionated TBI is safer than single-dose TBI with respect to IPS [27]; therefore, our center and others now use fractionated schedules. The role of the rate of delivering each TBI dose is debated [28]; lower dose rates are generally preferred, and current American Society for Radiation Oncology guidelines recommend a dose rate of <0.2 Gy per minute [29,30]. Finally, our center practices lung shielding, a technique to systematically reduce radiation exposure in the lung. The potential benefit from this practice is uncertain [31,32], and optimal protocols remain an area of active study.",

Together with these prior studies, our finding warrants additional attention in future investigations and justifies continued caution in transplanting patients with severely reduced lung function.",

We observed that grade III to IV acute GVHD remained highly associated with IPS after adjusting for other risk factors but notably accounted for just a small amount of the observed relationship between conditioning intensity and IPS. One interpretation of this result is that conditioning intensity mediates the development of both acute GVHD and IPS, explaining the high correlation between these 2 syndromes. Interrelated immune mechanisms in GVHD and IPS lend support to this argument. In experimental IPS models, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mediate signal transduction cascades that orchestrate noninfectious lung inflammation and injury [9,18,34, 35, 36]. In models of acute GVHD, similar cytokine dysregulation promotes expansion of alloreactive donor CD4+ cells [19]. Moreover, it is hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide translocation from intestinal damage resulting from conditioning toxicity or acute GVHD may result in the neutrophilic alveolitis observed in the later stages of experimental IPS [9,37]. Although we agree that immune-mediated lung injury contributes to the development of IPS, our study suggests that GVHD does not account for the totality of risk, and additional factors must be involved in the pathogenesis of early noninfectious lung injury.",

            "text": "Historically, clinical outcomes among patients with IPS after conventional HCT have been uniformly poor. Zhu et al. [4] most recently described an 87% (20/23 patients) 1-year mortality in patients who developed IPS within 120 days of HCT (study cohort 1997 to 2007) using similar diagnostic criteria. In the analysis by Zhu et al. [4], median time to death following diagnosis was just 9 days (range, 3 to 92 days) compared with 43 days in our cohort. Although this may be influenced by longer follow-up in our study, we believe this provides evidence that recent improvements in supportive care along with advances in transplant practices may be responsible for improved short-term mortality. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the provider, and assessing efficacy of novel treatment strategies was not the aim of this study. However, it should be noted that patients diagnosed with IPS typically received high-dose systemic steroids (2 to 4 mg/kg) and, in select cases of refractory disease, received the addition of etanercept, a soluble TNF-\u03b1-binding protein (0.4 mg/kg given twice weekly for a maximum of 8 doses) 38, 39, 40. Despite improvements in short-term outcomes, 1-year mortality remains high. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn about this observation, but we speculate that profound morbidity resulting from IPS drives poor long-term recovery, and our data confirm that short-term survivors of IPS remain a high-risk group of allogeneic HCT recipients. Finally, the associations we found between the need for mechanical ventilation or other organ injury with poor IPS outcomes are consistent with results reported in larger series of HCT recipients [41,42]. Organ injury likely reflects overall illness severity and not necessarily a distinct pathologic entity, but these observations are important and may aid physicians as they counsel patients and families regarding prognosis.",

Our single-center, predominantly white sample may limit generalizability, but the single-center design allowed for uniformity in practice pattern that may have improved our ability to assess for novel risk factors. The small number of cases restricted our ability to adjust completely for differences between patients with and without IPS, and it is possible that residual confounding exists; however, our very large cohort of well-characterized allogeneic HCT recipients allowed us to make several clinically relevant observations. Despite rigorous adjudication of cases, misclassification of IPS remains possible. We applied modern molecular techniques to identify previously occult viral pathogens, including HHV-6, but the possibility remains that we overestimated the incidence of IPS. Conversely, some patients with IPS might have been missed because of mild illness or because the patient was too ill to undergo an invasive diagnostic procedure. For these reasons, the incidence of IPS might have been underestimated.",
