Eggimann et al. examined several ways to report healthcare-associated infection rates and suggested some caveats for benchmarking rates of VAP. In a prospective cohort of 1,068 medical ICU patients, 127 episodes of VAP developed in 106 (23.5%) of 451 mechanically ventilated patients.10 The incidence of first episode of VAP was 22.8/1,000 patient-days; 29.6/1,000 patient days at risk, 35.7/1,000 ventilator days, and 44.0/1,000 ventilator days at risk. When considering all 127 episodes of VAP, infection rates increased from 22.8 to 27.3 episodes/1,000 ICU days and from 35.7 to 42.8 episodes/1,000 ventilator days. These data demonstrate the importance of the denominator chosen and may differ by as much as 40\u201360%. These rates have decreased in the past 3 years due to better prevention measures.",

Bacterial antigens and cytokines that alter the activity and efficacy of ciliary cells in clearing bacteria from the lower airway need further study. The ability of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes to eliminate bacterial pathogens, and the interaction of these cells with inflammatory cytokines, probably play important roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Cell-mediated immune response is controlled by a complex array of lipids, peptides, and cytokines, including interleukin-1 and -2 interferons, growth factors, and chemotactic factors. Leukotrienes complement components, and platelet-activating factor also assist in the inflammatory response and contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",

Also, the morphology of the bacteria is a clue to the offending bacteria (i.e., gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli may suggest Klebsiella spp, E. coli, or P. aeruginosa). It is also important to correlate these findings with aerobic culture results, because anaerobic cultures are not routinely performed.

Growth below the threshold suggests colonization or contamination with some exceptions. For example, patients who have had a recent change in antibiotics may have a false-negative BAL/PSB, perhaps early VAP, inadequate BAL technique, or other causes, such as Legionella pneumophila, viruses, or anaerobic bacteria. However, the quantitative approach may improve de-escalation of antibiotics by targeting the specific pathogens that are causing VAP. In one large, prospective, randomized trial of 413 patients with suspected VAP, patients receiving invasive management compared to those managed clinically had a lower mortality rate at day 14 (16 and 25%; p = 0.02, but not at day 28), lower mean sepsis-related organ failure assessment scores (p = 0.04), and significantly more antibiotic-free days (11 \u00b1 9 vs. 7 \u00b1 7; p < 0.001).47 Multivariate analysis demonstrated significantly reduced mortality (hazards ratio, 1.54 [CI, 1.10\u20132.16]; p = 0.01). Although a high percentage of patients in both arms received adequate initial antibiotics, more patients in the invasive group received adequate therapy than in the clinical group, and the impact of this difference on the observed mortality is of concern. This study suggests that the quantitative approach is safe, leads to less antibiotic use, and may potentially reduce mortality.",

This strain may continue to spread in the community and is likely to become a major healthcare-associated pathogen.39,79,80 Community-acquired MRSA isolates have increased virulence that may be related, in part, to the presence of the Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin. Furthermore, the combination of increasing hospital-acquired MRSA in healthcare settings and the rapid spread of community-acquired MRSA in selected high-risk populations and in acute and chronic healthcare settings requires close attention. Finally, the encapsulated pathogens S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, which may cause HAP, are common causes of bacterial superinfection following the yearly influenza outbreaks, and there is even greater concern over both hospital-acquired and community-acquired MRSA in the setting of a future bird flu pandemic.81\n",

In a randomized trial, DeRiso et al. demonstrated that the use of the oral antiseptic chlorhexidine (CHX) significantly reduced rates of hospital-acquired infections in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.113 Although topical antiseptics, such as chlorhexidine (CHX), provide an attractive alternative to antibiotics, the initial reported success in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery could not be confirmed by other studies. A recent study by Koeman et al. provides important data from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of VAP outcomes for subjects treated with 2% CHX paste versus patients randomized to 2% CHX + 2% colistin (COL) paste to provide greater activity against gram-negative bacilli compared to placebo.114 Compared to the placebo group, the daily risk of VAP was reduced by 65% in the CHX group (p = 0.01) and 55% in the CHX\u2013COL group (p < 0.03). This impressive result for an inexpensive, nontoxic, topically applied modality warrants further attention, but is difficult to reconcile with the absence of effect on ventilator days, length of stay, or mortality. It is important to measure how prophylactic use of CHX and CHX\u2013COL complement other effective prevention strategies, and resistance could become an important issue over time.",

Immediate administration of adequate antimicrobials is now considered a critical element in the effort to improve survival in HAP/VAP. The choice of the initial antibiotic regimen should be patient-oriented and guided by directed staining of respiratory samples. Prior hospitalization, presence of comorbidities, and the pressure of index cases are helpful indicators in order to anticipate the presence of MRSA, A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa. Local surveillance data and prior exposure to specific antibiotics (which should be avoided in the initial regimen) help in the choice of the initial antibiotic treatment. Antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted 48\u201372 h after the onset of pneumonia, based on a combination of quantitative respiratory cultures and resolution assessment. The duration of treatment should also be individualized; however, courses longer than 1 week are rarely justified.",
