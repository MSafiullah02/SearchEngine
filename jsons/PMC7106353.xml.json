Expansion of human populations has caused both a greater proximity to wildlife habitats, resulting in the emergence of new zoonoses, and a massive urbanisation process, which facilitates the rapid spread of communicable diseases in human beings. Travel across the world has become increasingly frequent, resulting in the ever-increasing risk of worldwide contagion spread. These emerging problems were highlighted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.1 Imported highly infectious diseases (HID), such as Lassa fever and viral haemorrhagic fever, have been reported many times in the literature but have seldom been at the origin of an outbreak.2, 3 Terrorist attacks with biological agents pose a substantial threat to the safety, health, and security of the citizens of every country.",

This network of clinicians, public health epidemiologists, microbiologists, infection-control and critical-care clinicians, who are experienced in the management of HID, represent national or regional infectious diseases units designated to care for patients with HID. One of EUNID's agreed tasks was to develop a consensus statement on the design and operation of high-level isolation units (HLIU) in Europe.25 An HID is transmissible from person to person, causes life-threatening illness, presents a serious hazard in health-care settings and the community, and therefore requires specific control measures.25 An HLIU is defined as a health-care facility that is specifically designed to provide safe, secure, high-quality and appropriate care, with optimum infection containment, infection prevention, and control procedures for a single patient or a small number of patients who have, or who may have, an HID. These units have also been described as biocontainment units by US experts.26 We define an isolation room as a single-bed room with negative pressure.",

The final consensus was reached and validated during two consecutive meetings in Rome in May and October, 2007.

The CDC described the new standard approach to manage patients with febrile respiratory illness as \u201crespiratory hygiene\u201d or \u201ccough etiquette\u201d.54 Patients with cough and fever should be encouraged to report symptoms at admission and should be encouraged or asked to wear a surgical mask and wash their hands after contact with respiratory secretions. These patients should be separated from other patients in the waiting area, and should be examined and assessed as soon as possible by the emergency staff in a single room.54 Signs should be displayed in the waiting areas to promote these measures and to educate patients and health-care workers, and emergency staff should comply with droplet precautions.",

Severely ill patients may necessitate frequent blood sampling and intravenous line placement for reliable antimicrobial or antiviral drug administration.

NPPV reduces the intubation rate and is effective in the treatment of SARS-related acute respiratory failure without posing infection risks to health-care workers.69, 70, 71, 72 In this setting, intubation has been avoided in up to two-thirds of cases in some studies.73, 74 If aerosolisation and airborne transmission are discounted, respiratory secretions or fluids, or both, are the main route of SARS transmission, ultimately leading to an overwhelming risk of infection via intubation. However, this mode of transmission does not occur with other airborne pathogens, most notably avian influenza, which can aerosolise or disperse up to 0\u00b75 m around a patient undergoing NPPV.75 The main problem with dispersion through NPPV is not the exhalation portion of the respiratory circuit but the inevitable mask leaks. Consequently, intubation or mechanical ventilation should be preferred to NPPV if safely achievable to control droplet aerosolisation and dispersion. Consequently, endotracheal intubation should be done by the most skilled person available. In addition, that person should wear personal protective equipment, including eye protection, and use rapid sequence induction.43\n",

Research and development of universal, bedside, reproducible, and transferable diagnostic tools are mandatory. Prompt reporting to the authorities is needed so that a rapid response can be organised. These measures should be accompanied by harmonised recommendations for the safe care of these unusual patients. The recommendations reported here by our group will hopefully help establish consensual protocols. Networking for the standardisation of procedures and the management of these patients is mandatory.",

More than 1400 references were obtained. Selection criteria within the topics were the impact factor and half-life of the journal, followed by journal availability. The topics selected were as follows: patient's criteria for admission to the HLIU, admission to the emergency department, safe sampling for laboratory investigation, isolation of suspected HID patient in HLIU, intensive-care management of HID patients, HID in paediatric patients, practice of invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy and gastroscopy, radio imaging, renal dialysis, and post-mortem examination of HID patients. Only English-language articles were reviewed. Websites such as WHO, CDC, and other scientific and international research society's guidelines were also used.\n",
