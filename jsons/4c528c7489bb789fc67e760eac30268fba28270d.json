Briefly, HepG2 cells were electroporated as described above using 9 \u00d7 10 6 cells per electroporation mixed with 5 \u03bcg of in vitro transcribed HEV RNA. To harvest intracellular virus, cells were lysed by repeated freeze and thaw cycles at day 7 post transfection. To quantify the HEV infectivity titers, a serial dilution infection assay was performed using HepG2/C3A cells. 7 days later virus titers were determined by counting the number of focus forming units per milliliter (FFU/mL) as described below. Virus stocks were used to infect HepG2/C3A cells, which were seeded 1 day before 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well in quadruplicates per condition in a 96-well plate, with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.06-0.23. At 24 h post inoculation, medium was changed and indicated samples were treated with compounds as described. Treated cells were washed three times with PBS 24 h later and fresh DMEM complete was added. At day 6 post infection compounds were added to indicated samples. One day later the production of intracellular infectious particles was analyzed for 2 wells per condition by the freezethaw method and subsequent dilution infection assay. For that, intracellular virus was serially diluted threefold and used for inoculation of HepG2/C3A cells seeded 1 day before 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well. For quantification of virus infectivity, FFU containing ORF-2 positive cells were counted in the highest dilutions where FFU are present.",
