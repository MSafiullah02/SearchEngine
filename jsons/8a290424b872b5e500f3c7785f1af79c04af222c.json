GE is also the most common disease and the leading cause of morbidity in the developed world. For example, it is suggested that in the United States (USA), everyone is likely to suffer from viral GE at least once a year, 610,000 will be hospitalized, and at least 4,000 will die from this disease [ 1 ] . GE can be caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and parasites and by ingestion of noninfectious toxins or medications, with viruses as the most common offending agents [ 1 ] .

The two structural proteins, the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins, are encoded by ORF2 and ORF3, respectively [ 19 , 22 ] . Structural analysis of NoV has revealed that each viral capsid is composed of 90 dimers of VP1 in a T = 3 icosahedral symmetry [ 8 , 23 ] . VP1 folds into two domains: a shell (S) domain that is responsible for initiating capsid assembly and icosahedral contacts and a protruding domain (P), containing two subdomains of P1 and P2, that enhance the stability of the capsid by providing intermolecular contacts between VP1 dimers [ 24 ] . In addition to providing the sole structural shell component of NoV capsid, VP1 has to perform other functions including immunogenicity and infectivity. It was suggested that the P domain may contain cellular receptor binding sites and viral phenotype or serotype determinants [ 23 , 25 , 26 ] . The P2 subdomain has the most variable sequence among different NoV strains and is found to protrude outside the capsid surface, suggesting that it is responsible for the immune recognition and cellular interactions [ 27 , 28 ] .

With the development of new diagnostic methods, it is now recognized that the impact of these viruses had been signifi cantly underestimated as they cause far more outbreaks and infections than previously realized [ 30 , 31 ] . NoVs require an extremely low infectious dose, as challenge studies with NV have suggested that the probability of infection with a single virus particle is approximately 50 % among susceptible human populations [ 32 ] . They can be transmitted by several routes including fecal-contaminated food or water, direct person-to-person contact, indirect exposure through droplets, or contaminated objects of infected persons [ 33 ] . The high environmental stability of NoVs further facilitates their spread among human populations. For example, NoVs are stable at a wide range of temperatures from subzero to 60 \u00b0C and at pHs even below 2.7 and are resistant to treatment with chlorine (0.5-1.0 mg/L), ethanol, quaternary ammonium compounds, or detergent-based cleaners [ 34 , 35 ] . As a result, NoVs are highly contagious, spread rapidly, and their outbreaks commonly occur in various social places and settings where people share common food and water sources or are in close physical proximity, such as cruise ships, schools, military units, nursing homes, daycare centers, hospitals, restaurants, and catered events [ 29 , 36 -39 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 136, "text": "[ 29 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 353, "end": 364, "text": "[ 30 , 31 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 579, "end": 585, "text": "[ 32 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 787, "end": 793, "text": "[ 33 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1144, "text": "[ 34 , 35 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1499, "text": "[ 29 , 36 -39 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission and Infection Cycle of NoVs"}, {"text": "Viral shedding may start before symptoms even occur and continue after they have disappeared.

For example, NoV has been identifi ed as one of the most common pathogens for hospital ward closures [ 45 ] . Outbreaks of NoV GE are distributed worldwide and year-round, although as its old name \"winter vomiting disease\" implies, there are more outbreaks during the winter season of the year [ 46 ] . It was suggested that this seasonality is due to climatic conditions that promote a closer person-to-person contact and favor the survival of the viruses [ 47 ] .

Furthermore, P2s of different viral genotypes have been found to have specifi c affi nity for certain ABO HBGA, with GI NoVs preferentially binding to group antigens A and O, and GII to group antigens A and B [ 56 , 57 ] . Consequently, it is suggested that HBGA may serve as putative receptors for NoVs [ 54 , 55 , 58 -60 ] .

These results clearly demonstrate the ability of mammalian cells in supporting the replication of NoV genomic RNA and the assembly of viral RNA into virus particles.

On the other hand, the high sensitivity of the assay may produce false-positive results from nonspecifi c amplifi cation or potential sample cross-contamination. This challenge has been addressed by designing more specifi c primers to avoid amplifi cation of nonspecifi c RNAs and by implementing more stringent procedures to prevent cross-contamination of samples. Due to the extraordinary sequence diversity among viruses in this genus, there is no single universal primer pair that can detect all strains of NoV. However, several primer pairs have been developed that can detect more than 90 % of all strains in GI and GII [ 85 ] . The robustness of RT-PCR-based diagnostic methods is being further optimized by employing faster and more sensitive assays such as real-time quantitative RT-PCR, which aims to rapidly detect even low copy number NoV in a large number of stool samples during outbreaks [ 86 ] . These studies demonstrated that TaqMan based real-time PCR offers more sensitive real-time diagnosis of NoV in both sporadic cases and the outbreak setting, and its results are easy to interpret and available within the working day [ 87 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 150, "text": "[ 84 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 779, "end": 785, "text": "[ 85 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1062, "text": "[ 86 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1303, "text": "[ 87 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Diagnostic Methods and Therapeutics for NoV GE"}, {"text": "Overall, TEM, ELISA, and RT-PCR-based methods all have their advantages and challenges.

Fortunately, the discovery of the spontaneous assembly of expressed VP1 into virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native viruses has facilitated vaccine development [ 73 ] . VLPs combine the best traits of whole-virus and subunit antigens for vaccine development. VLPs are noninfectious, therefore, safer than inactivated or attenuated virus due to the lack of viral nucleic acid genome. At least in theory, the immunogenicity of VLPs can even be enhanced over that of the native virus by excluding immunosuppressive viral proteins in their composition. Moreover, an inactivation process is unnecessary for VLP production. Consequently, no unintended epitope modifi cation would occur, further ensuring the VLP's immunogenicity. Importantly, VLPs can induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses without adjuvants and are more effective vaccines than other subunit antigens because their architectures mimic infectious viruses. VLPs can be produced by recombinant technology in heterologous expression systems without requiring the ability to support viral replication [ 31 ] . This is particularly important for NoV because no such culture system has been developed to support the growth of these viruses [ 96 ] . The particulate nature and the dense repetitive array of epitopes on their surface make VLP far more immunogenic than other subunit vaccines. VLPs can effectively induce T-cell-mediated immune responses through interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), especially dendritic cells (DCs). Specifi cally, VLPs can mimic the natural viral infection process by being specifi cally recognized and taken up by DCs and subsequently processed and presented to cytotoxic T cells to trigger their activation and proliferation [ 97 ] .
