However, no studies have examined the prognostic role of serum HMGB1 levels in cardiac surgery, while the importance of a reliable biomarker reflecting extensive systemic inflammation cannot be overemphasized in terms of accurate risk stratification and as a potential guide for selective application of therapies in that regard. This prospective, observational study aims to investigate the prognostic role of HMGB1 through identifying the relationship between serum HMGB1 concentrations and the incidence of the composite of morbidity endpoints in patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery.",

Over the past decade, the dominant role of HMGB1 as an early and late mediator of inflammation has been well-recognized, where it migrates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm or is secreted outside the cell by various disease processes7,18,19. Well-known downstream molecular pathways that further aggravate systemic inflammation and tissue injury involve the activation of toll-like receptors, receptors for advanced glycation products, and NF-\u03baB20. Accordingly, increases in the concentration of HMGB1 in the blood has been implicated as a potential biochemical marker of inflammation linked to outcomes in clinical practice21. Indeed, the concentration-dependent activity of HMGB1 has been shown to be associated with the occurrence, development, and prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases by recent studies that include acute coronary syndrome, MI, and heart failure11,22,23. Despite its potential prognostic importance in cardiovascular disease, its role as a predictor of outcome in cardiac surgery has not been tested heretofore.",

However, the correlation between post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations and CPB duration was weak (\u03b2 coefficient = 0.373), while the independence of these variables on predicting outcome could be verified in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Therefore, our results implicate that extensive and harmful inflammatory response cannot be anticipated simply by the patient\u2019s baseline inflammatory status or the duration of CPB adding value to the prognostic importance of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations in that regard. Of note, inflammatory response is meant to be protective, which is possibly the main reason why studies validating the efficacies of indiscriminate anti-inflammatory measures on outcomes after cardiac surgery yielded conflicting results6. Whether tailored anti-inflammatory therapy guided by post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations would actually improve outcome remains to be proven by future studies.",

Second, since our study involved complex valvular heart surgeries, caution should be exercised not to extrapolate our results to other cardiac surgeries.
