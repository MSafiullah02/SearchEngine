SARS-CoV is markedly different from other members of the Coronaviridae family and is the only coronavirus currently known to cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans (Lee et al., 2003). The complete SARS-CoV genome has since been sequenced and all viral proteins including the membrane glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein identified (Marra et al., 2003).",

Several functions including viral packaging, viral core formation, and signal transduction have been attributed to the coronavirus nucleocapsid (Hiscox et al., 2001, He et al., 2003). The M protein was reported to be the most abundant viral protein expressed during infection and a key protein in the assembly of both naked and enveloped virus particles (Kuo and Masters, 2002). However, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and membrane protein share little amino acid (aa) homology with those of others in the family and the many potential roles of this suspected multifunctional proteins are yet to be determined. Similarly, the 25-kDa membrane (M) glycoprotein also has low homology with other coronavirus M proteins.",

            "text": "To better understand the process of SARS-CoV viral assembly, we performed an in vivo mammalian two-hybrid assay (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to investigate the interaction between the N and M proteins. Mammalian two-hybrid systems are one of the most commonly used assays for the detection of in vivo protein\u2013protein interactions that we have successfully employed in our studies on multimerization of SARS-CoV N protein (He et al., 2004). Because this assay is performed in vivo as opposed to other in vitro biochemical methods, viral proteins are prone to be in their native conformations and therefore interactions are more likely to be biologically accurate (Luo et al., 1997). The N and M proteins were obtained from PCR amplification of cDNA, reverse transcribed from the SARS-CoV RNA isolated from a clinical specimen. The N protein gene was cloned in frame into the pM vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which carries a Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) (pM-N), while the M protein was cloned in pVP16 vector (pVP16-M), which carries a herpesvirus VP16 DNA activation domain (AD). In the case of an interaction between the two proteins, the BD and AD domains form a transcriptional activation complex and activate the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene provided on a third transfected vector (pG5SEAP; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The intensity of protein\u2013protein interaction, as reflected by reporter activities, was measured by a chemiluminescent assay.",

The transfection reagent Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to deliver the plasmids into the cells according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The Huh7 cell line is derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma cells that are commonly used for gene expression studies (Degawa-Yamauchi et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2002). Control samples are listed in Fig. 2. Transformed cells were monitored for protein\u2013protein interaction by assaying culture medium for SEAP activity (Great EscApe SEAP; Clontech). As indicated in Fig. 1\n, the pM-N + pVP16-M cotransfected sample showed an approximately over 5 times higher chemiluminescence activity compared to controls (pM-N + pVP16, and pM + pVP16-M co-transfections). The results obtained from the mammalian two hybrids system indicate that interaction between M and N does take place, consistent to findings in other coronaviral systems (Narayanan and Makino, 2001, Escors et al., 2001, Kuo and Masters, 2002).",

PCR products of the truncated nucleocapsid sequences were ligated in frame into the pM vector. The truncated constructs were \u0394pM-N1, \u0394pM-N2, \u0394pM-N3, \u0394pM-N4, \u0394pM-N5, and \u0394pM-N6. Each truncated construct was co-transfected with pVP-M and the pG5SEAP reporter plasmid separately into Huh7 cells. Forty-eight hour after transfection, SEAP assay was performed to quantify the level of chemiluminescence activity. As shown in Fig. 2b, \u0394pM-N3 construct (aa, 135\u2013220) showed the highest activity level among all six constructs, while \u0394pM-N1, \u0394pM-N2, and \u0394pM-N4 resulted in moderate activity levels. In addition, \u0394pM-N5 and \u0394pM-N6, which correspond to the carboxy region of the N protein, shared the lowest SEAP activity. The result suggested that the region containing aa 135\u2013220 may be crucial for the N and M protein interaction.",

Furthermore, a region in the middle of the N genes appears to be important for M\u2013N interaction, an observation that is different from what has been reported in MHV, a coronavirus that may have the closest genetic resemblance to SARS-CoV among all coronaviruses. In MHV, it is the carboxy terminus of the N protein not the central region, which has been implicated previously in M protein binding by indirect mutational analysis (Kuo and Masters, 2002).",

Thereby, it can be envisaged that replacing the matrix protein in the role of core stabilization through nucleocapsid binding appears to be one of the functions of the coronavirus M protein. A recent study on MHV suggests a multiple binding role for the nucleocapsid protein in virus assembly and morphogenesis (Narayanan et al., 2003). The M protein has also been found to have a viral RNA binding site that interacts with the RNA packaging signal (Narayanan et al., 2003). Through the complex of viral RNA, nucleocapsid protein, and M protein, it is evident that the assembly of a mature coronavirus is a multi-step process involving protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interactions.",

Although SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein shares low homology with others in the coronaviral family, our current study revealed that the M\u2013N protein\u2013protein interaction exists in SARS-CoV as it does in other members of the Coronaviridae family, reinforcing a notion that M\u2013N interaction forms the crucial structure for coronaviruses. Interestingly enough, aa 168\u2013208 have also been found to be indispensable for multimerization of N proteins (He et al., 2004), suggesting that this region is pivotal for maintaining the native structure of the N protein so that physical interaction can take place for both N\u2013N self-interaction and N\u2013M interaction. In other words, it could be envisaged that this region may not serve as contact site for either N\u2013N or N\u2013M interaction, future studies using techniques such as cross-linking and peptide mapping could be helpful in identifying the exact role of this region. It should be noted, however, that the region (168\u2013208) may be critical in maintaining M and N interaction, other regions in the N protein may provide accessory roles in facilitating this process since all truncated and deletion mutants demonstrated relatively lower chemiluminescence than that of the full-length N protein (Fig. 3b). More studies are ongoing in our laboratories to further investigate the functional role of this region using other experimental approaches such as reverse genetics. Taken together, our data has shown for the first time that the SARS-CoV N and M proteins can interact with each other in cells susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and amino acids 168\u2013208 of the N-protein appear to be necessary for one of the critical steps of viral assembly and maturation process.",
