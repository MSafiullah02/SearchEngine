The influenza virus belongs to the genera Orthomyxoviridae and causes an acute respiratory tract illness in children and adults. Influenza undergoes frequent and extensive genetic changes, allowing for a yearly seasonal pattern of recurrent infections along with the development of novel subtypes that have the potential to create larger pandemics. More recently, avian subtypes have begun to cause disease in humans who have had direct contact with infected birds. Unfortunately, resistance to antiviral agents has emerged over the last few years. Influenza is one of the most influential viruses in history, and will undoubtedly continue to affect public health and challenge clinicians and policymakers in the future.",

Influenza A is responsible for human pandemic outbreaks and seasonal epidemics, and Influenza B is responsible for increasing numbers of cases of seasonal disease. Influenza C causes rare human disease, mostly in children. Influenza viruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome. The eight RNA segments of the genome encode for 11 viral proteins, including the polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2), matrix proteins (M1, M2), and the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuroaminidase (NA) ( Table 1) . Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of the HA and NA glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virion. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified and are found in 144 different combinations (e.g., H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) (Table 1) [1, 2] . The HA glycoprotein mediates attachment and entry of the virus by binding to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface. The binding affinity of the HA to the host sialic acid allows for the host specificity of Influenza A. Once inside the cell, viral replication begins immediately with the cessation of host cell protein synthesis. The NA glycoprotein allows the spread of the virus by cleaving the glycosidic linkages to sialic acid on the host cells and the surface of the virus. The virus is then spread via bodily fluids or through direct contact with secretions. Viral synthesis and release occurs for approximately 12-24 h, and then eventual cell death occurs due to cessation of host protein synthesis and cell-mediated apoptosis driven by the influenza infection [2] .",

Like other RNA viruses, the Influenza A viruses lack proofreading ability and are therefore subject to point mutations. These individual mutations in the viral genome cause minor changes in the antigenic character of the virus, with amino acid changes in HA and NA of principal importance. This drift occurs as the virus travels and replicates through a susceptible population. Subsequent disease caused by a new strain created from antigenic drift is less severe than with a novel strain, as partial immunity within the population often remains, but the extent of the seasonal epidemic varies yearly [2] [3] [4] .",

The three major pandemics that have occurred in the last century (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, and 1968 H3N2) have been associated with reassortment. As Influenza A is host-specific, a less specific host, or \"mixing vessel,\" that is more susceptible to all subtypes is required. Pigs, which possess receptors for both the human and avian subtypes, are a traditional \"mixing vessel,\" but any species, including humans and wildlife, can potentially play a similar role. In the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) pandemics, a pig was implicated as the intermediate host for viral \"mixing\" of two strains. Recent infections of humans with avian subtypes of Influenza A (e.g., H5N1) have heightened concerns that humans can function as a \"mixing vessel\" after direct infection from birds [2] [3] [4] .",

The virulence factors responsible for severe disease outbreaks are becoming better understood. First, the binding location may determine the extent of local inflammation and severity of disease. Human virus subtypes H1, H2, and H3 bind to \u03b1-2,6 linkages found in human upper respiratory epithelium. Humans also have a smaller number of \u03b1-2,3 linkages, mostly located in their lower respiratory tract and conjunctivae; these are the preferred binding sites of the avian subtypes. Thus, binding of an avian subtype is more likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract and thus presents as pneumonia rather than as upper respiratory symptoms (Table 2 ) [5] . Second, local and systemic cytokine release varies with subtypes. In a mouse model of an engineered 1918 H1N1, significantly higher levels of specific cytokines, most notably IL-2, IL-6, and TNF were found locally and systemically [1, 5] . Additionally, the NS1 protein, which antagonizes host cell interferon, appears to have had increased activity. These characteristics of the deadly 1918 virus have also been found with the most recent severe human infections with influenza caused by the avian subtype H5N1 [1] . Finally, influenza viral replication is usually limited largely to the respiratory tract, but in some subtypes (e.g., H5N1) viremia has been detected, adding to the burden of disease [5] . ",

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as any influenza that causes severe disease or death in domestic poultry. HPAI viruses, with very few exceptions, are of the H5 or H7 subtype, but not all H5 and H7 subtypes are HPAI viruses. The potential pathogenicity of H5 and H7 subtypes can be evaluated by sequencing the HA gene, since pathogenicity is associated with the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site ( Table 2) . A change from a low pathogenic H5 or H7 subtype to a highly pathogenic form may occur upon introduction into poultry and is thought to occur primarily as a result of insertion of basic amino acids in the HA cleavage site. Molecular studies have shown that the 1918 human pandemic H1N1 subtype originated as a low pathogenic avian virus. In contrast, current human cases of H5N1 worldwide are the result of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.",

This leads to extensive local inflammation with neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the sub-epithelium of the respiratory tract. Particularly with avian subtypes, this leads to a hemophagocytic syndrome and severe diffuse alveolar damage, causing the clinical findings of severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Within the alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes, MHC I upregulation leads to antigen presentation of the hemagglutinin and other subcapsular proteins. This eventually leads to natural killer cell destruction of infected cells and the development of neutralizing antibodies (largely against HA) by day 14 of infection. When compared to human subtypes H1 and H3, infection with avian subtype H5N1 appears to infect lower respiratory tract cells, inhibit NK cell function, deplete lymphocytes, inhibit MHC class I upregulation, and inhibit cell apoptosis [2] .",

Influenza A viruses predominate, with a H3N2 subtype currently making up the majority of isolates. Influenza B viruses are isolated more frequently late in the season and are more likely to be found in children [2] . Influenza B viruses are the most commonly reported influenza type in Europe, while both Influenza A and Influenza B viruses predominate in Asia and the southern hemisphere. Outside of the winter season, influenza occurs infrequently. In temperate tropical regions, influenza can occur at lower levels throughout the year. Furthermore, summertime outbreaks of influenza have occurred on cruise ships or in individuals returning from areas of increased activity [2, 4] . Influenza A outbreaks typically begin abruptly, they peak over a 2-3 week period, and they last for 2-3 months. The earliest indication of influenza activity is an increase in febrile respiratory illnesses, usually in children and then adults. The factors that determine the extent and severity of outbreaks vary yearly. The susceptibility of the population, as determined by the prevalence of antibodies to circulating virus, clearly plays a major role. Additionally, the virulence of the seasonal strains differ each year, and thus their efficiency of transmission or their ability to cause symptomatic infection will vary as well.",

Only a few cases of self-limiting conjunctivitis were reported in patients in each country, at the time of a poultry outbreak. The patients had each had contact with a sick bird without the appropriate protective equipment. Then, in 1997, a large-scale HPAI H5N1 outbreak occurred among poultry in Hong Kong farms and markets, and direct human disease occurred, with 18 documented human cases and 6 fatalities. Two subsequent poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1999 and 2003 with HPAI H5N1 occurred without human cases until 2003, when two members of a family in Hong Kong contracted HPAI H5N1. In December of 2003, HPAI H5N1 surfaced in poultry in Korea and China, and from 2003 to 2006 the poultry outbreak spread worldwide.

In 2003 in the Netherlands, a large poultry outbreak of H7N7 subtype resulted in 89 cases of influenza disease among poultry workers and a veterinarian; there was one death (the veterinarian). Two cases of conjunctivitis caused by subtype H7N3, a low pathogenicity strain, occurred among poultry workers during a Canadian outbreak in 2004. Finally, in 1999 and again in 2003, Influenza A subtype H9N2 caused a mild, self-limiting respiratory infection in children during a poultry outbreak. Clearly, HPAI H5N1 is the largest and most significant poultry and human avian influenza outbreak recorded, but other subtypes have caused significant diseases as well (Table 3 ) [6] . Human cases of avian influenza have been mostly acquired by direct transmission from infected birds to humans. In each of the outlined outbreaks, the humans have consumed undercooked or raw poultry products or they have had direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated fomites. All birds have been ill or dead, and transmission has only been documented from domesticated poultry or waterfowl. No transmission to humans from wild birds has been reported. Thus far, human-tohuman transmission has occurred in a few cases and with poor efficiency. During the 1997 HPAI H5N1 Hong Kong outbreak, one household contact of an ill poultry worker became infected. Health-care worker studies at the time also showed a 3.7% seroprevalance rate for H5 antibodies among the workers caring for the ill during the outbreak (0.5% in controls). During the 2003 worldwide HPAI H5N1 outbreak, two family clusters were suspected, and in 2004 one case of daughter to mother transmission was confirmed in Thailand. An additional family cluster from Indonesia with eight infections from a single source was also suspected in 2007 [1] . Three subsequent studies of health-care workers in Thailand, Vietnam, and China all showed not nosocomial transmission. Finally, in 2003 during the H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands, three cases of household contacts with minimal disease were reported [1, 6] .",

Additionally, the severity of fever and malaise was also decreased during the study. There was no effect on overall mortality or the development of complicated influenza in initial studies. Both amantadine and rimantadine reach peak serum levels approximately 1-2 h after initial dose. Serum concentration is slightly higher with rimantadine, which has a half-life elimination of approximately 36 h. In the elderly, amantadine reaches higher serum levels and has a longer half-life of 16 h when compared to young adults. Rimantidine is metabolized and excreted by the liver and thus must be dose-adjusted in hepatic dysfunction.

However, due to the low levels, no adjustment for renal dysfunction is required. In clinical studies with zanamivir administered twice daily for 5 days, the median time to alleviation of influenza symptoms was 1 day shorter compared to placebo [12, 13] . This occurred for both Influenza A and B but was dependent on time of administration. Benefit was seen when zanamivir was given within 30 h of the onset of symptoms. No benefit was demonstrated if administered after 30 h. Studies in immunocompromised hosts and in patients with severe cases of influenza were not performed, so in those settings where viral shedding and disease may last beyond 48 h, zanamivir may have some theoretical benefit. In high-risk patients, the development of influenza complications, especially asthma and bacterial pneumonia, was also diminished. The major side effect of zanamivir was asthma and bronchospasm and thus the drug should be used with caution in those with underlying lung disease.",

In multiple clinical trials, oseltamivir reduced the median duration of symptoms of influenza (fever, cough, malaise) by 1-2 days when given within 24 h of onset of symptoms. The reduction of symptoms appeared to be greater in laboratory-confirmed Influenza A when compared to Influenza B. Complications, including pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and otitis media, were lowered by as much as 50% in adults and children. Antibiotic use also was reduced in the oseltamivir group. As with zanamivir, oseltamivir is well tolerated, with only 15% of patients reporting nausea.

Resistance occurs with amino acid substitutions at either the NA or HA site. With NA mutations, a substitution of glutamine to glycine at position 119 in Influenza A and 117 in Influenza B results in decreased binding affinity at the NA active site. Cross-resistance is variable with this mutation, as resistance to oseltamivir was not conferred to zanamivir; when conferred, it has led to tenfold increase in the inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this mutation has yielded decreased viral infectivity and binding ability that was subsequently demonstrated in animal models [15] . Changes in the HA at or near the sialic acid binding site alter the viral binding and decrease the viral dependence on the NA. This change confers class resistance, as HA mutations to oseltamivir during treatment lead to a tenfold increase in the inhibitory concentrations of zanamivir. The development of resistance appears to be related to prolonged viral replication and shedding. In a few cases in highrisk patients (bone marrow transplant), therapy with oseltamivir led to resistance after receipt of the drug for 2 weeks, with two NA mutations and an M2 mutation conferring a 1,000-fold increase in zanamivir inhibitor concentrations. After therapy was terminated, the NA mutation disappeared but the M2 change persisted. Thus, therapy with prolonged viral shedding in certain hosts (e.g., immunocompromised) may lead to multiple mutations at the NA and HA sites, increasing resistance. However, thus far, there is no evidence that these mutations persist in the community [14, 15] .",

Two major types of vaccines currently exist: an inactivated compound (TIV) and a live attenuated virus (LAIV). Both types of vaccines are trivalent, in that they contain the HA and NA for two Influenza A strains (H1N1, H3N2) and one Influenza B strain. The inactivated vaccine contains either whole virus or subvirion products, which are designed to ensure the presentation of a relevant HA and NA to the immune system. Inactivated influenza vaccine is given intramuscularly. The live attenuated virus is different as it is developed from a cold-adapted attenuated virus that contains the reassorted HA and NA of the selected strains. The LIV is administered by nasal mist spray and subsequently leads to replication of the virus in the distal upper respiratory tract (cold adaptation area).

In studies with TIV, children over the age of 2 years had 59-65% protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza. In children under 36 months of age, efficacy appeared directly related to a history of prior influenza infection, as those with antibodies to Influenza A or B prior to vaccination developed a more robust response [16] . In addition to reduced rates of influenza infection, lower rates of otitis media and asthma exacerbation were also noted. Finally, children's immunity appeared to confer protection to other nonvaccinated household members, with an over 40% reduction in household members experiencing a febrile illness [21] . LAIV has efficacy rates of 30-93% depending on vaccine match, but with a close match, efficacy in children was around 93% [16] . Interestingly, protection in the second year after vaccination was 87%, even when the vaccine strain did not match, suggesting some increased protection against mismatched strains in children. As with TIV, cases of influenza acquired after vaccination were significantly milder. Multiple studies comparing LAIV to TIV in children show a 55% greater efficacy of LAIV than TIV, as assessed by laboratory-confirmed cases of Influenza A. Additional increased efficacy with LAIV in those with asthma (35%) and chronic respiratory infections (55%) was also noted. Finally, where vaccine mismatch occurred, LAIV was 35% efficacious while TIV provided no protection [16, 18] . For Influenza B, the efficacy of LAIV and TIV was similar in these studies [38, 16, 18, 21] .",

In household contacts, influenza significantly reduced the rates of influenza (4% vs. 16%) when compared to placebo.

Because a pandemic will come in multiple waves affecting different populations, targeted prophylaxis will be difficult. Strain type, resistance, and virulence may all effect susceptibility, and the necessary length of prophylaxis will be unknown. Thus, the need for large amounts of neuraminidase inhibitors will be a limiting factor in providing protection and prophylaxis to all members of the community. Targeted prophylaxis algorithms and plans will need to be used instead to lessen the burden of disease and focus on the highest risk members of the community [17] .",

Additional changes in the last two decades include the increased infection in humans by avian subtypes with high morbidity and mortality. \u2022 Treatment of influenza is supportive, and if given early, antiviral treatment can reduce symptom time and complications. Due to recent emergence of widespread resistance to adamantanes, only the neuraminidase inhibitor class is currently recommended for treatment. \u2022 Vaccination against influenza is the mainstay for prevention, with the elderly, children, and high-risk groups recommended for vaccination. Both inactivated and live attenuated virus vaccines are available. Prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors can provide protection in high-risk groups.",
