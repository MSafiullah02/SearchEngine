            "text": "Noroviruses (NoV) belong to the family Caliciviridae and have been identified in the human being and in several animal species including the bovine (Scipioni et al., 2008b, Green, 2007). Noroviruses are small, round, non-enveloped viruses, with a 25\u201340 nm diameter and have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with three open reading frames (ORF). The non-structural proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the single capsid protein (VP1) and the minor structural protein are encoded by ORF1, 2 and 3, respectively (Green, 2007). Ninety dimers of VP1 form the capsid which presents an icosahedral symmetry under electron microscopy (EM). Capsid protein VP1 has a molecular weight of around 55\u201360 kDa and is organised into two domains: a shell (S) domain (N-terminal part of VP1) and a protruding (P) domain (C-terminal part of VP1) (Prasad et al., 1999). The P domain supports receptor recognition and immunogenic functions (Lochridge et al., 2005). Noroviruses are difficult to grow in cell culture but abundant quantities of virus-like particles (VLP) can be obtained by expressing VP1 in the baculovirus protein expression system. These VLP are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native strain (Jiang et al., 1992).",

In gnotobiotic calves, BoNoV induce non-hemorrhagic enteritis, mild diarrhoea, transient anorexia and malabsorption (Woode and Bridger, 1978). But the real impact of these viruses in the field is currently poorly evaluated. The two genotypes of BoNoV were recently shown to be endemic in Great Britain and Germany (Oliver et al., 2007b). They were also isolated in all continents and thus seem to be widespread (Scipioni et al., 2008b).",

In a first virological approach, the molecular prevalence was investigated in diarrhoeic calf samples during a 1-year study. In a second serological approach, a VLP-based ELISA was developed and the cattle seroprevalence against BoNoV was estimated in the same region. Together the results suggest an association of BoNoV infections with the age of the animals.",

            "text": "Stool samples from calves aged 1 week to 6 months were systematically received from a Belgian diagnostic laboratory each month through the year 2007. Samples came from different places out of five provinces of Belgium (Hainaut, Namur, Liege, Luxembourg, Walloon Brabant). Their origin was either from diarrhoeic samples (n\n = 74) submitted for etiologic diagnosis of gastroenteritis or from necropsy samples (n\n = 59) where gastroenteritis lesions were found. This stool bank (n\n = 133) was screened by one step RT-PCR for the presence of BoNoV genome sequences with Quick Access kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Four different primer pairs were used to amplify segments of the polymerase gene and the beginning of the capsid region: CBECu (Smiley et al., 2003), JV12/13 (Vinje et al., 2003), P289/290 (Jiang et al., 1999) and BEC (Ike et al., 2007). These primers were selected in order to perform the broadest detection of NoV including a possible zoonotic transmission. Out of the BoNoV specific primers (CBECu and BEC), CBECu pair was seen to detect not only genotypes 2 but also genotypes 1 BoNoV with an apparent sensitivity of about 83% relative to the p289/290 pair in a previous study (Smiley et al., 2003). RT-PCR program consisted in a reverse transcription step of 45 min at 45 \u00b0C followed by the PCR reaction. It consisted in an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94 \u00b0C followed by 40 PCR cycles (30 s denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C; 1 min annealing step at 48 \u00b0C for CBECu, JV12/13 and BEC primers, 51 \u00b0C for p289/290 primers; 2 min extension step at 68 \u00b0C) and a final extension step of 10 min at 68 \u00b0C. Positive amplicons were purified from agarose gel and cloned into pGEMt Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sequencing reactions were carried out on three clones of each amplicon with the BigDye terminator kit version 3.1 (AppliedBiosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) and resolved with an ABI 3730 automatic capillary sequencer (AppliedBiosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Nucleotidic sequences were analysed with the BioEdit Sequence Editor version 7.0 software. Nucleotidic similarity with the NCBI genetic database was assessed using the BLAST tool (available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic inference was performed with the MEGA version 4 software package (Tamura et al., 2007). Phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor-joining analysis where evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The confidence values of the internal nodes were calculated by performing 1000 replicates bootstrap values.",

A BoNoV prevalence of 7.5% was found in stool samples of diarrhoeic calves.

            "text": "The molecular prevalence of BoNoV in samples coming from the Belgian diagnostic laboratory was in accordance with studies in Great Britain (Milnes et al., 2007) and Korea where Park et al. (2007) report also a majority of genotype 2 infection. The genotype of the strains detected in the British study was not clarified. The prevalence determined by RT-PCR analysis in this study is also similar to the results obtained by an antigen capture ELISA in Germany and developed using a genotype 1 JV strain (Deng et al., 2003). As genotypes 1 and 2 BoNoV are antigenically distinct (Oliver et al., 2006), the true BoNoV prevalence could be higher or a preferential geographic distribution could exist. In contrast, Mattison et al. (2007) detected only 1.6% positive in stool samples from a random study in Canadian cattle but Smiley et al. (2003) detected up to 72% of samples positive in two farms in USA. In a longitudinal study in The Netherlands, prevalences of 31.6 and 4.2% were found in farm stool samples and individual samples of dairy cattle, respectively (Van Der Poel et al., 2003). Thus, prevalence results by RT-PCR seem to depend on the continent, the country, the sampling strategy and especially on the test conditions (e.g. annealing temperature, primers, use of internal control as mentioned in Scipioni et al., 2008a). Also the type of study, cross-sectional versus longitudinal as a part of the Dutch study, could explain some differences. BoNoV infection seems to be strongly related to the age with a higher rate in the first year of the animal life. Positive results were obtained along all the sampling period (data not shown) but further research is needed to investigate a potential seasonality for the infection unlike as described for HuNoV (Mounts et al., 2000). In our results, we detected more isolates with the CBECu pair than with all the other pairs. Also, the CBECu primers allowed the detection of two bovine rotavirus infections with however a small difference in the molecular weight for the amplicon (418 bp versus 532 bp). To our knowledge, such observation has never been reported and it could account for some differences between RT-PCR prevalence results depending on the primers used. Nucleotide similarities were found between the CBECu primers and the prototype bovine rotavirus sequence to which they matched by BLAST. On the 23 nt of the CBECu-F sequence, 14 nt including the last five nt matched exactly with the sequence of the bovine rotavirus polymerase (VP1, genbank accession number: J04346). Nucleotide similarity for CBECu-R was smaller. The CBECu-F primer was designed to match the widely conserved YGDD motif in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of RNA viruses (Bruenn, 1991) and this could explain the detection of bovine rotavirus. Some strains were detected with primers designed to detect HuNoV (JV pair) but at a low rate, as previously reported (Van Der Poel et al., 2003). No HuNoV sequences were identified despite the use of two primer sets designed for their detection, suggesting at least a very low prevalence of these human viruses in cattle. Despite the variety of the primers used in the present study, the lack of detection of the genotype 1 BoNoV could be explained by suboptimal primer use for the RT-PCR (Oliver et al., 2007b). The age of the cattle population studied was also suggested as an explanation for the lower detection of genogroup III genotype 1 NoV (Oliver et al., 2007b). As RT-PCR primers used in this study only target the viral polymerase region and thus miss potential recombinant strains, the possibility that some positive samples contained chimaeric bovine noroviruses could be another explanation for the low apparent prevalence of GIII.1 noroviruses.",

Oliver et al.

In our conditions this serum reacts against a fraction containing VLP but also with infected Sf9 cells, in denaturing conditions. To test the specificity of this reaction against infected Sf9 cells, western blots were carried out with foetal calf serum and serum from a colostrum deprived newborn calf used in this study. With these two sera, a positive band at the same molecular weight was observed with baculovirus infected Sf9 cells under denaturing conditions whereas no reaction was detected in non-denaturing conditions (Mauroy and Thiry, unpublished results). These data confirm the non-specific binding of bovine immunoglobulins on denatured protein extracts from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells. In non-denaturing conditions, the serum only reacts against VLP. Thus, B309 VLP are representative of the genotype 2 BoNoV.",

Genotypes 1 and 2 in the BoNoV genogroup, although antigenically distinct, were shown to cross-react in ELISA to the heterologous VLP but at low serum dilution (log10\n 1.7) (Oliver et al., 2006). However the true genotype 2 seroprevalence should still remain high, even corrected for a lower sensitivity and specificity of the test. The OD values obtained with the serum raised against rabbit IgG in bovine confirmed the selected cut-off. Almost all colostrum deprived calves did not have antibodies against BoNoV as previously described (Deng et al., 2003). It suggests that BoNoV infection is mainly localised in the intestine, according to the observations with HuNoV (Mattner et al., 2006), and that vertical transmission of the virus is rare. The rise in antibody levels in 1 or 2 weeks old calves suggests an acquisition of antibodies through colostrum absorption or from early infection. Information on prevalence brought by the RT-PCR analysis suggests that the risk of infection during the first 6 months of life is high. The antibody levels determined by ELISA rise again in the post-colostral period (6 months to 1-year old). These results could be explained by a large exposure during this period and the development of natural immunity.",

Several characteristics of NoV (environmental resistance, fecal-oral transmission) and farming practices in developed countries could increase the risk of re-infection in cattle, whereas such re-infection was not observed during a prospective RT-PCR study in The Netherlands (Van Der Poel et al., 2003) and during a cross-sectional RT-PCR study performed by ourselves on stool from up to 6 months old cattle (n\n = 47) housed in two different premises (Mauroy and Thiry, unpublished results). However in a retrospective study in Great Britain, Milnes et al. (2007) have amplified norovirus sequences by RT-PCR in adult stool samples. The detection of high levels of antibodies in the adult also suggests their presence in the colostrum. It could explain the antibody rise in neonates after colostrum intake. Remarkably, in contrast to the 1-week to 1-year-old group, some OD values of adult cattle were below the cut-off of the test. These data suggest that antibody levels decrease in some adult cattle reinforcing the hypothesis of a short lived immunity.",

As they bind specifically HuNoV to their digestive tissues (Le Guyader et al., 2006) and as BoNoV sequences were also detected in these molluscs (Costantini et al., 2006), new recombinant strains could appear through mixed infection. Such event was already reported with human strains (Symes et al., 2007). Mixed infections could occur in countries with high population densities of human and production animals and with high prevalence of BoNoV in premises.
