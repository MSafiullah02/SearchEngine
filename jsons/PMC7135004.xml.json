            "text": "When the data reviewed in this rational clinical examination installment are applied to the ED setting, it is vital to consider the characteristics of the study populations. First, the time frames of the 6 studies reviewed centered around the influenza season, and in 2 of these studies well persons at least 60 years old (median ages of 66 and 70 years) were enrolled and then followed forward until some developed symptoms suggestive of influenza, at which point correlation between symptoms and presence of virus was studied. In these 2 studies, 7% and 8% of enrolled patients developed influenza. However, for the other 4 studies, patients were younger (for each study, the reported mean or median ages were from 26 to 35 years) and were enrolled after they developed symptoms suggestive of influenza. These symptoms included fever in all 4 studies and cough, sore throat, headache, and myalgias in at least 3 of the studies. Three of the 4 studies were in family practice offices in Oklahoma, Paris, and The Netherlands; the fourth reported results of multicenter clinical trials in North America, Europe, and the southern hemisphere. The remarkably high prevalence of influenza in these 4 studies (28% to 67%) leads the reader to ask how the authors selected patients with such a high prevalence of disease if clinical characteristics are not useful. It seems likely, therefore, that either the study populations were endemic for influenza infection or, more likely, that the clinical syndrome of influenza found in these studies is relatively identifiable when multiple suggestive factors are present.",

Making influenza tests available in the ED during the influenza season appears to result in physicians ordering fewer tests overall and reduces ED length of stay,7 but the effective use of testing is limited to a particular range of pretest probabilities, and individual physicians may have widely varying estimates of pretest probability in a particular patient.8, 9 The best inference may therefore be that physicians should familiarize themselves with prevalence of disease data throughout the influenza season to inform their choice of whether or not to use a rapid diagnostic test.",

It ranges from 0 to infinity, with higher values indicating better test performance. Although it can therefore be used to compare the performance of different tests, there are several concerns with using this test result. First, the actual value is of little clinical utility otherwise, because there is no recommended reference range for diagnostic utility and few physicians think in terms of odds or odds ratios. Second, it cannot be used to estimate the probability of disease in any individual patient. The LRs are much more useful for this because they can be used to translate a pretest probability in the individual patient into a posttest probability of disease.11 Third, most clinicians do not have a firm grasp of the utility of diagnostic odds ratios. Finally, in the case of influenza clinical characteristics, even findings with the highest diagnostic odds ratios in age-unrestricted patients are associated with LRs that are not clinically useful in deciding whether a given patient has or does not have influenza.",
