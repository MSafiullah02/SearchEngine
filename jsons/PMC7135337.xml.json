As of 2010 it had been signed by 168 nations, although stages of ratification vary. The FCTC contains guidelines for implementing demand-reducing policies toward tobacco including health policies aimed at protecting the public with respect to commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry, protection from exposure to tobacco smoke, packaging and labeling of tobacco products; and limits or bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship.7 Tax increases for tobacco control are considered to be clinically effective and very cost-effective relative to other health interventions,8 while the implementation of smoking bans in public areas appears to reduce the risk of heart attacks significantly, particularly among younger individuals and nonsmokers, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (September 29, 2009 issue). Researchers reported that smoking bans can reduce the number of heart attacks by as much as 26% per year.9, 10\n",

Vulnerable road users include pedestrians, cyclists, and both the rider and passenger of motorcycles and scooters. Vulnerable road users account for 46% of deaths, and in low-income countries pedestrians account for nearly half of all road accident\u2013related deaths.48\n",

The World Conference on Disaster Reduction was held in Japan in January 2005, and resulted in the creation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (HFA), which was endorsed by 168 UN member states and urges all countries to make major efforts to reduce their disaster risk by 2015. The HFA outlines the need to increase awareness and understanding about DRR, the importance of knowing the real and potential risks, and taking action against them. Specific recommendations included the need to create or enhance early-warning systems, build DRR into education, and reduce risk factors such as deforestation, unstable housing, and the location of communities in risk-prone areas.",

Drug resistance in treating many diseases and illnesses is a major concern, as witnessed in malaria and tuberculosis, and with a highly mobile world population, global pandemics such as SARS, H5N1, and H1N1, for which treatments either are not available or levels of suitable drug are clearly not sufficient for a worldwide epidemic, are proving to be very challenging. This clear inability to predict and maintain sufficient levels of treatment for potential threats makes health risk reduction extremely difficult, and in developing countries where resources are already stretched to cope with existing health issues, creating effective programs will require intervention from social partners, global support organizations, and aid from the developed world. An ever quickening pace of globalization means that public health\u2013related problems in one area of the world will have an impact on those living in another area and therefore, it is in everyone\u2019s interest to ensure that all countries, irrespective of their economic development and available resources, are sufficiently supported to maintain and review strategies that will effectively reduce morbidity and mortality rates in all spheres of public health.",
