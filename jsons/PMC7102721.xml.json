            "text": "All data were collected as part of routine clinical practice in 15 outpatient physical therapy clinics of Intermountain Healthcare, located in the Salt Lake City, Utah region from October 1, 2004 through April 30, 2010. The Intermountain Physical Therapy clinics maintain an electronic database that stores data from all physical therapy visits. The database contains basic demographic information about each patient (age, sex, onset/surgical date, and reason for referral). Clinical outcomes, including a pain rating and region-specific disability score, are collected at the beginning of each visit and entered into the electronic database. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS)17 is used as the region-specific disability questionnaire for all patients with disorders related to the hip at Intermountain Physical Therapy. The LEFS is a 20-item self-report measure designed to assess functional status for patients with a variety of conditions affecting the lower extremity. Each item of the LEFS is scored from 0-4, with the final score expressed as a sum out of 80 possible points. Higher scores are associated with higher functional status. Although the LEFS was designed for use with a variety of lower-extremity conditions, high reliability estimates have been shown in the THA population (internal consistency 0.93, intraclass correlation coefficient 0.85-0.92, and minimally detectable change of 9 points).17, 18 The LEFS is easy for the patient to use and it is quick to administer and score.17, 18 A numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) is used to assess the patient\u2019s current pain level at each visit. The NPRS is a 0-10 scale with 0 representing \u201cno pain\u201d and 10 the \u201cworst imaginable pain\u201d (Cronbach coefficients 0.86-0.88; test-retest reliability 0.57-0.83).19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Extracted demographic data for this study included age, sex, date of surgery, the number and dates of all visits during the physical therapy episode of care, and the clinical outcome scores (NPRS and LEFS) recorded for each visit. This study qualified for exempt review from the Institutional Review Board at Intermountain Healthcare.",

Patients were identified in 1 of 2 ways. First, we examined the reason for referral in the Intermountain Physical Therapy electronic database. All patients categorized as referred following arthroplasty of the hip were considered for inclusion. To identify patients who may have been categorized otherwise in the electronic database, we examined the Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical record (EMR) from the hospital within Intermountain Healthcare performing the majority of THA procedures, identifying all patients with an International Classification of Diseases-9 procedure code indicating a THA procedure (81.51); we then cross-referenced these cases with the Physical Therapy electronic database. If a patient identified as having a THA was also in the electronic database with an initial visit date that was after the THA surgical date, the patient\u2019s physical therapy record was reviewed for inclusion.",

If more than 30 days elapsed between visits, the episode of care was judged to be completed. Indicative of usual outpatient physical therapy practice, the patient\u2019s initial visit in physical therapy occurred at varying times from the date of surgery. Recovery curves constructed from the LEFS scores of patients after THA in a controlled research study13 suggest that at 9 weeks postsurgery, the patient\u2019s rate of recovery slows and the patients appear to function moderately well, such that they would have no difficulty with light activity, but would still have a little difficulty with stairs, walking far distances, and with heavy activities. Therefore, physical therapists may expect patients who begin physical therapy within 9 weeks after surgery to have diminished physical function due to the natural recovery progression postsurgery; whereas those patients initiating physical therapy 9 weeks or more following surgery may be seeking treatment because their recovery is not progressing as anticipated. We therefore defined an episode of care with the initial visit occurring within 9 weeks (ie, <63 days) of the date of surgery as an \u201cearly start\u201d in physical therapy. An episode of care with an initial visit occurring after 9 weeks (ie, \u226563 days) was defined as a \u201clate start.\u201d",

The use of a multilevel model allows repeated measures to be gathered over the treatment time by accommodating different time points between scores, allowing different numbers of scores between subjects, and accounting for the correlation that occurs with repeated scores.35 An unconditional covariance structure was used in the basic model, with LEFS scores as the repeated variable (independent variable) and weeks after surgery as the dependent variable. To explain the variation in intercepts and slopes across individual predictors of recovery such as sex, age, and episode of care, early/late start time and number of physical therapy visits were evaluated. Following the basic model, a conditional analysis examined predictors of recovery, which were added as level 2 fixed-effect terms into the model. A growth curve will depict the predicted LEFS scores over time using the final conditional model. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).",

When the potential predictive variables were examined, only sex remained in the early start model (Table 3, Table 4\n). The expected functional score for a patient, on average, was 13.3 (SD 1.3) across all patients. The expected gain in functional score per point of LEFS was 3.5 (SD 14.2). The intercept and slope have a negative correlation of \u22120.4 across patients, so patients with higher functional scores show smaller average gains. Although men had a higher LEFS score at initiation, the pattern of recovery was similar by sex, with a steady linear increase over the first 15 weeks followed by a plateau in physical function occurring between weeks 15 and 20, as shown in Figure 2\n.",

The application of the hierarchical modeling techniques minimize the potential limitation of missing values by allowing each patient to contribute independently to time points. Second, the data were limited to 15 clinics within one practice setting. Therefore, practice patterns and patient progress may not be reflective of all total post-THA patients. Third, the preoperative functional status was unknown due to patients initiating physical therapy after their THA. In controlled studies, preoperative function has been shown to predict postoperative recovery.11 The lack of preoperative scores in our study may overestimate the rate of recovery.
