The standard insights extraction pipeline is typically an unsupervised machine learning task composed of processes that preprocess the text, visualize it, cluster and identify the topics and sentiment in each cluster, and then graph the network. Given the increasing amount of data being generated on the internet in Africa today, and the multilingual state of African countries, we evaluated how well the standard pipeline works when applied to text wholly or partially written in indigenous African languages, specifically Bantu languages. We carried out an exploratory investigation using Twitter data and compared the outputs from each step of the pipeline for an English dataset and a mixed Bantu language dataset. We found that for Bantu languages, due to their complex grammatical structure, extra preprocessing steps such as part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis are required during data cleaning, threshold values should be adjusted during topic modeling, and semantic analysis should be performed before completing text preprocessing.",

Hence, it is extremely important that we develop resources and tools that can be used to parse out useful information from free-text written in any language. In this paper, we investigated whether the standard insights extraction pipeline is sufficient when applied to a single language family indigenous to Africa, Bantu languages, using the following questions: (1) how well does the standard insights extraction pipeline apply to Bantu languages; and (2) if found to be inadequate, why, and how can the pipeline be modified so as to be applicable to Bantu languages?",

Bantu languages have an agglutinating morphology, where words consist of several morphemes, and each affix agglutinated with the root word carries meaning such as tense and aspect [21] . The writing system of Bantu languages is either conjunctive or disjunctive [25] . In the former case, several orthographic words, 'I love them', are written as a single word, for example, Mbakunda in Runyankore (a language indigenous to Uganda). The latter case writes different orthographic words as separate words. For example, the same translation for 'I love them' is Kea ba rata in Sepedi (a language indigenous to South Africa).",

However, not all Bantu languages have the initial vowel on the prefix [11, 17] ; for example, 'person' in Sepedi is motho, with prefix mo-and stem -tho. Noun classes are also at the heart of an extensive system of concordial agreement that governs grammatical agreement in verbs, adjectives, possessives, subject, object, etc. [11, 25] ; this is a pivotal constituent of the whole Bantu sentence structure [25] .",

In this section, related work on extracting insights from collections of documents is presented. The scope here is limited to social media data, specifically textual data, and more so, Twitter data, because the vast amount of content generated and shared through social media contains rich knowledge and covers a wide spectrum of social dynamics [33] . In their socio-semantic analysis of Twitter data, Lipizzi et al. [15] stated that the following processes are necessary to extract complete and valuable insights from data: (1) preprocessing the text, (2) identifying and classifying opinions in the network, (3) analyzing the sentiment of individual or groups of text, (4) visualization of the large amounts of data; and (5) extracting conversational maps from social streams. We subdivided these processes into seven steps, including dimensionality reduction and clustering, shown in Fig. 1 .",

Thus, dimensionality reduction, which involves transforming highdimensional data into a meaningful representation of reduced dimensionality, is an essential part of text mining [6, 31] . However, for the lower dimensional representation to be meaningful, it must be a good approximation of the original document set given in its full space [6] . The commonly used techniques for dimensionality reduction are: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which both minimizes information loss and increases interpretability [6, 10] ; Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a stable and robust technique [9] ; and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), which is particularly well suited for the visualization of high dimensional datasets [30] .",

The live tweets were archived based on the trending hashtags during the period of data collection. The six Bantu languages targeted were IsiZulu, Luganda, Runyankore, Sepedi, Sesotho, and Setswana. These languages were selected because they cover both conjunctive and disjunctive writing styles, and they are understood by the authors. However, due to the use of the mixed code writing style, we found tweets that contained terms in other Bantu languages beyond the six considered. Our investigation was limited to Twitter data due to the inherent difficulty of performing opinion mining on it, resulting from the informal writing style used and limited tweet length. We hypothesize that the findings based on Twitter data are generalizable to other social media platforms. We further limited the size of each dataset to 20,000 tweets, as the results based on a limited dataset are also generalizable to a larger dataset. Both datasets were run through the seven processes in the standard pipeline, and analyzed for any significant differences. For text preprocessing, we used the same techniques as described in [26, 32] . However, no stemming/lemmatizing was performed on either dataset because, to the best of our knowledge, two of the Bantu languages (Luganda and Runyankore) do not have tools for this 2 . We used multiple approaches for dimensionality reduction (PCA, and a combination of SVD followed by T-SNE), clustering (K-Means and NMF) and topic modeling (LDA and NMF), in order to consider the approach which gives the better result.

The mixed Bantu language dataset comprised three conjunctively written languages (isiZulu, Luganda, and Runyankore) and three disjunctively written languages (Sepedi, Sesotho, and Setswana). As explained in Sect. 2, Bantu languages are written either conjunctively or disjunctively, and therefore, there is a need to differentiate between them in order to perform the appropriate preprocessing. Taljard and Bosch [25] identified that a word-class tagger is sufficient for disjunctively written languages, while a morphological analyzer is required for the conjunctively written languages. This is because the disjunctive system of writing requires bound morphemes to be written as orthographically distinct units (Kea ba rata 'I love them' in Sepedi), thus making morphological information explicit in the orthography [25] . On the other hand, the conjunctive writing style requires a morphological analyzer to make the different morphemes in the orthography explicit [25] , for example from Mbakunda to m-ba-kunda 'I love them' in Runyankore. The authors concluded that the differences in writing systems necessitate the use of different architectures specifically for part-of-speech tagging. The need for part-of-speech tagging was identified as crucial during text preprocessing and therefore, the type of writing style first needs to be identified before this can be performed.",

However, the stem of a noun is not unique, but rather gets its full semantics from the prefix. Table 1 shows examples of tweets from the dataset where stemming the noun will result in a meaningless stem 4 (the nouns of interest are in bold font, with the prefix underlined). The examples shown in Table 1 highlight the problem that can result if nouns are stemmed during text preprocessing. For Sepedi, sepedi (a language) would be indistinguishable from mopedi (a member of the Bapedi tribe); for Setswana, setswana (a language) would have the same stem as Botswana (a country); for isiZulu, umuntu (person) would be reduced to the same stem as abantu (people).

            "text": "In addition to the increasing number of verb forms owing to the extensions shown in Table 2 and the noun class system, Bantu languages typically have a very large number of tenses [20] . For example, Runyankore has 14 tenses [28] and these too are part of the verb form. This complex grammatical structure results in a single verb root having thousands of possible verb forms. Therefore, verb stemming/lemmatizing is a crucial step during preprocessing, which, if not performed results in very high levels of sparsity in the resultant matrix. 4 The translations to the text in Table 1 Adjectives also require stemming because the full form of an adjective depends on the noun class of the noun being described. Therefore, the number of forms that a single adjective can take depend on the number of noun classes in that language. Runyankore, for example, has 20 different forms for each adjectival stem because it has 20 noun classes. Table 3 shows some examples of the forms that the adjective 'beautiful' in Runyankore -rungi and Sepedi -botse (the adjective prefix is underlined). [21] . As a result, for the conjunctive writing style, an entire sentence can be represented as a single word. Consider the following Runyankore example from [28] : Titukakimureeterahoganu, meaning 'We have never ever brought it to him', and comprises the morphemes titu-ka-ki-mu-reet-er-a-ho-ga-nu. For this reason, all tweets, despite their length, were included in the topic modeling of the mixed Bantu language dataset. We also included all tokens in the mixed Bantu language dataset during topic modeling. Although, this is contrary to the recommended minimum token count of three, it was done because, as explained in Sect. 4.2, a single verb stem can be inflected into thousands of verb forms, and it should therefore be expected that, without performing verb stemming, such tokens will be extremely rare in the dataset. From measuring the number of tokens below the recommended threshold count of three in both datasets, we found that 72.04% of tokens in the mixed Bantu language dataset were below this threshold, compared to 0.00% in the English dataset. This is a significant result, again pointing to the importance of verb stemming during preprocessing. Conversely, the English dataset, which was not stemmed either, does not show such an adverse need for it. There are currently no publicly available sentiment analysis implementations for any of the Bantu languages used during this investigation. However, we assessed the currently available tools to evaluate whether sentiment analysis could be done following the standard pipeline. In Sect. 3, four features were identified as important for sentiment analysis; three of these (terms and their frequency, adjectives, and opinion words and phrases) are also applicable to a Bantu language dataset. However, if verb stemming is performed during text preprocessing (as we recommend in Sect. 4.2), negation will present a differentiating factor for Bantu languages. This is because, for conjunctively written languages, the negation morpheme(s) is agglutinated to the verb stem, while for disjunctively written languages, the negation morpheme is not necessarily only used in the context of negation. Consider the excerpts from the dataset shown in Table 4 5 writing styles (the negation morphemes are underlined and the verb roots are in bold font).",

(3) Sentiment analysis is performed during text preprocessing, before any negation morphemes are lost during verb stemming. Further, it is performed after part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis, in order to avoid the ambiguity of the negation morpheme identified for some disjunctively written languages, while also making the negation morpheme explicit for conjunctively written languages.

Results showed that: conjunctively written languages should be distinguished from disjunctively written languages, because they require different preprocessing steps; verbs and adjectives, but not nouns, should be stemmed; threshold counts should be revised during topic modeling; and sentiment analysis should be done before verb stemming, in order to prevent the loss of the negation morpheme. Future work will include implementing these recommendations and assessing their effectiveness.",
