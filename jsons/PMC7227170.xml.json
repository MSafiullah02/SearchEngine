The prevalence of demented patient found in the present study (13.1%) is lower than the previous estimates of the prevalence of dementia in hospital, which vary from 15% to 42% (7). According to our data, the diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization. We suggest that the onset of hypoactive delirium and worsening functional status in people with dementia may be considered a sign of possible COVID-19 infection during this epidemic. Early recognition of COVID-19 in demented people can help provide timely treatment and adequate isolation. Hospitals should develop integrated care models, create Special Care Geriatric COVID units and promote guidelines to ensure the better possible treatment for frail older persons.",
