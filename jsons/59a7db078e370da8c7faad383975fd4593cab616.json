Age was positively associated with LOS in both groups (Table) . 5 The current coronavirus outbreak around world shared different epidemic characteristics from those in the early stage [3, 4] . More patients without travel history to infected area or direct contact with a case-patient were diagnosed with COVID-19 [5] . Although full scale of review showed no epidemiological link, several potential risks were found. For example, a few patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 after a trip to non-infected area, indicating a potential larger epidemic area and an underestimated spread rate of virus. Shopping mall and catering business posed a high risk of infections, given the outbreak of COVID-19 in spring vestival. In addition, special care should be took to limit visits to hospitals for treating chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.",

In this study, elder patients were more susceptible to longer LOS, which was consistent with previous study [7] . In addition, TOS was found to be negatively associated with LOS, indicating that as the pandemic spread, the length of hospitalization for patients recovery from COVID-19 may become shorter. This pattern was only found in cases without epidemiological trace, suggesting that the course of this disease was potentially impacted by mode of transmission. Given the late onset of symptom accompanied with short LOS, it appeared that the severity of virus may decline over time. Future studies may focus on the identification of modes of transmission other than travel to infected area or direct contact with a case-patient.",

During the hospitalization, oral swabs and blood samples were collected and sent to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China for identification of COVID-19 using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. All patients had genetic confirmation of COVID-19 and recovered after standard care. According to \"Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection by the National Health Commission\" (issued by Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China), indications for discharge were set as symptoms relief combined with negative RT-PCR [2]. Cases with travel history to infected area were the patients who have a trip to Hubei province, the epicenter of COVID-19 in China.",
