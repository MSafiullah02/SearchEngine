The system describes the different provided lights and the conditions under which they are switched on/off in order to improve the visibility of the driver without dazzling the oncoming ones. The system can be viewed as a lights controller that reads different information form the available sensors (key state, exterior luminosity, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the lights in order to ensure a good visibility for the driver according to the information read. Our model is built using stepwise refinement with the Event-B method. We consider all the features of the case study, all proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers. Our model has been validated using ProB by applying the different provided scenarios. This validation has permitted us to point out and correct some mistakes, ambiguities and oversights in the first versions of the case study.",

We use Event-B to construct and represent this formal model. The exterior light system subject of this case study has objective to adapt the brightness of the different lights with respect to the status of the car but also the oncoming ones. For that purpose, the cars are equipped with different lights that can be switched on/off under specific conditions. In this paper, we stress more on the modeling of low beams, tail lamps and direction indicators. Roughly speaking, the low beams illuminate the road when the vehicle is running or vehicle surrounding while leaving the car during darkness; tail lamps permit to illuminate the vehicle if it is parked on a dark road at night, whereas the direction indicators allow to inform the following vehicle that the car will turn on the right/left. To control these exterior lights, the driver acts on the different physical elements like the key, the hazard switch etc. The position of the key (NoKeyInserted, KeyInserted, KeyInIgnitionOnPosition) is transmitted to the controller of the lights via the sensor keyState. Similarly, the hazard warning switch, with two positions (On/Off), permits to make both director indicators flashing at the same time.",

A machine consists of events that modify state variables. An event has a set of guards and actions. When the guards hold, the event can be triggered; its actions can then modify the system state. A machine has state invariants that can be proved by discharging proof obligations.",

Existing variables can also be replaced by new variables; to show behavior preservation, a gluing invariant must relate the old variables to the new variables. An event refines an existing event by reducing its nondeterminacy, by strengthening its guards and/or choosing a value v, called witness, for a parameter p of the event. In that case, we should replace each occurrence of p by the value v in the guard and the substitution of the event. New events implicitly refine a skip event, so they cannot modify existing variables; they can only modify the added (new) variables. System constants are specified in contexts. A context can extend another context. Invariants are preserved by refinement, so invariants are introduced at the most appropriate step that simplifies their proof.",

A sensor measures the value of some environment characteristic m, called a monitored variable (e.g., the state of the ignition key), and provides this measure (e.g., whether the key is inserted or not) to the software controller as an input variable i. In a perfect world, we have m = i, but a sensor may fail. The software controller can influence the environment by sending commands, called output variable o to actuators. An actuator influences the value of some characteristics of the environment, call a controlled variable c. Variables m and c are called environment variables. Variables i and o are called controller variables. Finally, a controller has its own internal state variables to perform computations. We use Event-B state variables to represent environment (i.e., monitored and controlled ) variables, and controller variables. We do not model sensor/actuator failures.",

The body of a control loop represents a single event and state transition. This allows for the definition of priorities between input variable changes. In our model, we use a more abstract approach, as it is common in the Event-B style of system modeling. We define one event for each input variable change, which allows for a more modular specification that is easier to prove. This is closer to an interrupt-driven control system. Our Event-B abstraction is also a reasonable abstraction for a control loop, considering that in most cases, a single input variable changes between two control loop iterations. The control loop can be derived from our specification by merging all events and defining priorities between events.",

Machine M4 considers the cornering lights and Machine M5 and Context C4 consider the high beam headlights. Table 1 relates the components of our model with the requirements listed in [3] . As one can remark, some requirements are specified as invariant whereas others are only considered in the related events. Requirement ELS-10 for instance stating the duration of a flashing cycle does not correspond to an invariant but it is considered in the event flashingDark that makes the current time progress by a unit of time. Specifying such requirements as an invariant would require the introduction of two extra variables to store the starting and the ending moment of the cycle to set that the difference should be equal to a unit of time. Roughly speaking, a timed requirement, an action duration more precisely, is modelled as an event if there is no other requirement that refers to such a duration otherwise an invariant is associated with it. Moreover, let us note that M 3 is the refinement with the most invariants number because it models several interrelated lights, that is the low beams, the tail lamps, the parking lights etc.",

On the other hand, a proof-based approach for temporal formulas is proposed in [7] , but it generates a large number of proof obligations for a model of this size. Thus, we have chosen to express these properties as invariants by adding an extra variable to store the previous value of a state variable that is needed in a two-consecutive-state property. For example, to express ELS-16 as an invariant, we have to say that: (1) the current and previous states of the ignition are not equal to On, (2) the previous state of the switch is different from Auto, and (3) the current state of the switch is equal to Auto, which is represented by the following invariant (Machine M3, Invariant inv18) These extra variables storing previous values must obviously be maintained in the events that change the value of the corresponding variable, but also in events that rely on the previous value for making a decision, even if they do not modify the corresponding variable.",

In this case study, time can trigger changes on the state of lights (e.g. Requirements ELS-18, 19, 24, ... specify time intervals where particular lights have to be activated or not). A variable currentTime has been introduced in Machine M1 to model the time progression together with Event progress that increments this variable by an arbitrary positive number (Action act2). Action act1 specifies the lights whose state can be modified by a time progress. Table 2 describes the size of the model. Since Rodin does not use text files to store models, there are various ways of counting the lines of code (LOC) of a model. Moreover, code is inherited when refinement and event extension is used. Lines of code are computed using the Camille editor representation of the Event-B model, which does not count inherited LOC through event extension and puts all variables on the same line. Total LOC, which includes inherited LOC, is provided within \"( )\", and computed using the pretty printer of the Rodin Event-B Machine Editor. Comments are excluded. Since we do not use data refinement (i.e., no variable is replaced through refinement), we provide the total number of variables for each machine along with the number of new variables (i.e., introduced in a refinement) enclosed by \"( )\". Invariants are specific to each machine. Since some events are renamed by refinement, we provide the total and new events introduced in each machine. ",

Such scenarios (or counterexamples) may result from a guard/action missing but also from an incorrect invariant. This step permits us to fix trivial bugs before the proof phase that can be very long and hard. It is worth noting that even if the tool does not find any invariant violation, it does not mean that the specification is correct. Indeed, there may be a scenario that the tool fails to find for different reasons like a timeout on the model checking process. In the present case study, the model checking step permits us to detect missing actions in particular those related to the variables representing the previous state of an element.

This step permits us to exhibit several flaws/ambiguities in the initial release of the description documents (see Sect. 6 for more details). As examples of such flaws, we can cite the lack of prioritization between some requirements like ELS-16 and ELS-17 that share the same activation conditions when the daytime running light option is activated with the ignition in the Off position and the driver turns the switch in the Auto position. To correct these flaws/ambiguities, we have discussed with the case study authors because we are not specialists of the domain. For the above particular example, a priority is given to ELS-16 over ELS-17. It is worth noting that such flaws/ambiguities can not be detected in the model checking phase because they make the guard of some events unsatisfied, thus the event is not enabled and the invariant is thus not violated. Let us note that we had some problems to animate the first version of our models where we have kept the event parameter hl as a partial function on the set of all the lights. Indeed in that case, ProB checks all the possible partial functions on these lights which leads to a timeout. To overcome this issue, we have replaced each partial function by a more restrictive total function on the right domain, that is, the lights whose state actually changes after the execution of the event.",

These proof obligations aim at proving invariant preservation by each event, but also to ensure that the guard of each refined event is stronger than that of the abstract event. These guard strengthening refinement proof obligations ensure that event parameters like hl mentioned above are properly refined. For instance, hl is defined as a partial function in the abstract event headLightSet; it is refined using total functions by giving its value for each refining event. So, we have to ensure that these values satisfy the initial guard. Figure 2 provides the proof statistics of the case study: 1643 proof obligations have been generated, of which 23% (385) were automatically proved by the various provers. The remaining proof obligations were discharged interactively since they needed the use of external provers like the Mono Lemma prover that has shown to be very useful for arithmetic formulas. In addition, we have added some theorems on min/max operators (a min/max of a finite set is an element of the set, etc). Let us note that the results of this phase has especially impacted some modeling choices. For instance, to speed up the proof phase, we have included in the guards some properties tagged as theorems in order to prove them only once and reuse them in all the proofs that need them for that event.

We have communicated these to the authors of the requirements document, and a number of revisions were produced, following our comments. Our comments induced 9 of the 17 versions produced after the publication of the initial version of the requirements document. These modifications impacted 18 of the 49 requirements of the Exterior Light System. A detailed list of these elements are described in the last version (i.e., 1.17) of the requirements document. We have mainly rephrased some requirements for which the applicability conditions should hold at different time points. For instance, in requirement ELS-16, the condition \"the switch in position Auto\" should happen after the condition \"the ignition is already Off\". Moreover, we have defined priorities between requirements to make the specification deterministic: ELS-16 has priority over ELS-17, ELS-19 has priority over ELS-17, etc. We have also rephrased some sentences to clarify them. For instance in the first version of the document, the word \"released\" was used with the meaning \"button pushed\" in some places and with the meaning \"button not pushed\" in some others. To remove this ambiguity, we have replaced it with the terms \"active\" and \"not active\". Finally to make the modeling easier and after a discussion with the case study authors, the signal pitmanArm has been splitted into signals pitmanArmForthBack and pit-manArmUpDown with their corresponding positions (states) and the possible transitions between them.",

Recall that once a variable is introduced in a model, it cannot be modified by new events of subsequent refinements. Thus, when a variable is introduced, each event that needs to update it must be also introduced. In this case study, there are several dependencies between requirements elements. As many lights mutually rely on the same sensors and are correlated in terms of behavior, we have defined a single event, in the first machine, to model the light state changes and refined it according to the different actuators/sensors. But, we think that it would be interesting to look deeper into the existing structuring approaches for Event-B: decomposition [12] or modularization [4] , in order to structure the specification into smaller logical units to make the proofs easier. A refactoring tool based on the read/update dependencies between events and state variables would be nice. It could help in finding an optimal decomposition based on the connected components of a dependency graph for a given machine. Building such a graph from the requirements is not easy, as one typically needs to formalize the requirements to precisely understand which variables are needed and where. So, the specifier typically finds the ideal refinement structure only after creating a potentially non optimal refinement structure. Often a lot of effort has been invested in creating this first model, and there is no resource left to do a refactoring to obtain a better model. By better, we mean a model whose refinement decomposition would yield easier proofs for the same set of properties.",

Due to the model size (61 state variables), ProB was unable to verify invariant or temporal properties.

This case study is of a different nature than the previous ones in the ABZ conference series (i.e., 2014 Landing gear, 2016 Hemodialysis, 2018 ERTMS). Its elements are more tightly coupled, which made it more difficult to find an appropriate refinement strategy. It contains more properties to prove than the previous ones, but they are more localized properties (i.e., each property referring to a small number of events on at most two consecutive states) that do not depend on the relationship between monitored variables and controlled variables. However, we really think that the Event-B method must include modularization clauses as native structuring mechanisms like those of the B method that permit to have a modular specification since the first phases of the development. This will make Event-B more suitable for the development of big and complex systems. For comparison, in the ERTMS case study, we had to build a relationship between the real (actual) positions of the trains and the controller view of the train positions to prove safety properties. There were no such issues in the ELS case study.",
