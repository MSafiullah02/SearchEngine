In such cases, the patient is asked not to come to the hospital and the visit is postponed. Checkpoints were set up to assess patients for symptoms and to provide each individual with surgical masks before entering hospitals. No visitors or accompanying persons are allowed in the hospital and all shops, restaurants, and facilities remain closed (including vending machines).",

This measure freed ventilators for patients with COVID\u201019 and converted surgical theatres into additional intensive care unit beds as needed. Patients with cancer were prioritized by clinical priority and availability of resources: patients in probable need of postoperative intensive care were corralled into specific, government\u2010defined centres to free resources elsewhere. It is foreseeable that there will be a significant number of patients with benign conditions needing surgery after the surge in patients with acute viral illness falls. This will require extra resources to catch up on the backlog.",

            "text": "The need to care for patients with emergency presentation still continues during a pandemic. Therefore, surgical staff and the available units have been modified to balance service provision, reducing infection risk, and specialist care. Most centres have reduced the number of consultant/attending surgeons on the ward, down to one or two with similar trainee numbers per day, with larger teams being used for covering emergency and accident services. This policy reduces the number of working units attending the hospitals and limits unnecessary exposure of patients and healthcare providers. Indications for surgery in patients tested positive for COVID\u201019 should not differ from those who have tested negative in emergency conditions. Some colleagues report a worse postoperative course after complications in elective COVID\u201019\u2010positive patients, but data are lacking. There are some reports regarding patients with COVID\u201019 presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms that mimic surgical diseases, specifically a pancreatitis\u2010like clinical presentation.",

            "text": "There is no agreement of whether a dedicated COVID\u201019 staff should be allocated to infected patients needing surgery. Patients are not being tested for COVID\u201019 routinely as yet, especially if they are asymptomatic. Theoretically, this would imply that there should be the highest level of personal protection attire for surgical staff in every case. Due to the shortage of protection equipment hospital management tend to recommend use only in known COVID19\u2010positive cases even though this stresses individuals6. Some professional bodies state that the evidence for guidelines is limited, recommending no more than standard surgical protection for the scrub team6. This policy differs from that followed in many afflicted zone centres where the highest protective measures are being taken. There are no agreed policies about testing staff routinely but it is intuitive that it would be desirable to test all patients and staff in a pandemic. It is not clear whether the virus can be found in circulating CO2 used for laparoscopic surgery or aerosol generating procedures. Some allow the use of laparoscopy but question transanal minimally invasive procedures, due to the increased risk of exposure to aerosolized biological fluids with the latter7. Laparoscopy may reduce intraoperative exposure to smoke compared with open surgery and devices for smoke evacuation and cleansing are recommended where feasible. Some suggested using the closed circuit of the pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) if available, but cheaper and more readily available alternatives to reduce the contamination from aerosol from CO2 during laparoscopy have been proposed, such as connecting one of the laparoscopic ports to a water seal created with a sealed container by means of extension lines (https://www.escp.eu.com/covid19escp). Special attention should be paid to evacuating residual CO2 from the container and the abdominal cavity before removing the trocars. The Spanish Association of Coloproctology suggested that intracorporeal should be favoured over extracorporeal anastomosis to avoid contamination with a faecal aerosol8.",

The International Organisation for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) provided updated evidence on COVID\u201019 in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (https://www.ioibd.org/ioibd-update-on-covid19-for-patients-with-crohns-disease-and-ulcerative-colitis/). According to the Global Cancer Observatory of the WHO9, in Europe, every year approximately 500 000 patients are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and four million with any type of cancer. This would mean that \u2013 assuming that the crisis lasts 2 months \u2013 a diagnosis would be delayed in approximately 83 000 patients with colorectal cancer and more than 660 000 patients with any cancer. This estimate does not include the time needed to restore activity and catch up on the backlog so it is likely much higher. The COVID\u201019 outbreak made it necessary to suspend or reduce the number of multidisciplinary meetings. In the dramatic scenario of intensive care bed scarcity, patients with cancer may need non\u2010invasive options as a compromise (for example, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both) yet there may be treatment delays due to the pandemic. The potential disease progression, which is associated with quality of life and costs of care implications10, has a knock\u2010on effect that may happen with benign disorders too11.",

Perhaps this was a good idea whose time has come in the clinical arena but are we ready to embrace the technology for academic meetings? Many events have been cancelled already this year. Virtual meetings have advantages including a better environmental profile, lower costs, and on\u2010demand streaming. None of us was prepared to face a pandemic. Patients, relatives, and the community need to be provided with understandable information to limit the inevitable psychological burden. Surgeons and our healthcare colleagues facing psychological challenges with risk of burnout need support services. A joint international effort is advisable to face the COVID\u201019 fallout and establish pathways for crisis management.",
