Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were the most popular seed cells with 14 records followed by NK cells and mononuclear cells with 3 and 2 records, respectively. As for the biological therapy, 16 clinical trials focused on anti\u2010cytokine storm occurring in severe patients, like recombinant interferons recommended by the National Health Commission of China, anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, anti\u2010interleukin\u20106, and anti\u2010GM\u2010CSF. Seven clinical trials were going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inactivated convalescent plasma in the treatment of patients with COVID\u201019. Of the 71 records related to the western medicine, remdesivir captured the public's attention very much.\n2\n The other antiviral medications involved phosphoric chloroquine (23 records) and lopinavir\u2010ritonavir (17 records), which were also clinically used in the treatment now. Many kinds of Chinese traditional medicine or methods were under evaluation. The others were mainly about mental health of the patients, doctors, nurses, college students, the public, and the other kinds of diagnosis methods, like the lung ultrasound. None of specific vaccines are in the clinical trial stage.",

However, a strict designed protocol is a guarantee for the believable result, especially for the parallel randomized trials. Of the 221 interventional trials, only 19 trials (8.5%) have a good designed protocol according to the standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials.\n3\n Compared with the trials set outside of China mainland, another problem is that 55.1% of the 434 trials did not claim to use the right data management system including a paper case record form and an electronic data capture. Meanwhile, a big concern occurs that is 10 817 patients are receiving treatments in hospital and only few new cases are diagnosed nowadays (Figure 1C), while 51 793 patients with COVID\u201019 are needed in the trials. Further analysis showed that 209 trials were recruiting, 201 trials were not yet recruiting, 13 trials were suspended because of lack of patients and only 11 were completed. None of the completed trials belonged to interventional study. The possible solution is to integrate the similar trials and meanwhile, select some trials of top priority. Considering to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102,\n4\n, \n5\n we deemed carefully that the anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inactivated convalescent plasma, MSCs transplantation,\n6\n remdesivir, and tocilizumab\n7\n are the most four promising alternatives currently in the treatment of the patients with COVID\u201019, especially for the severe and critically severe types. Furthermore, we have primarily demonstrated that transplantation of ACE2\u2010 MSCs improves the outcome of patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia by revering the lymphocyte patten and regulate the cytokine storm.\n6\n\n",
