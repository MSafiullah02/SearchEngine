            "text": "The decoding of different genomes, in particular the human genomes has triggered a great deal of bioinformatics research. The research of sequence similarity to a known protein sequence or DNA sequence has been an important method to provide the first clues about the function of a newly sequenced gene. The research becomes increasingly useful in the analysis of newly sequenced genes as the sequence databases, such as DNA and protein databases, continue to grow in size. There are a number of standard schemes widely used to search for homologous sequences in nucleotide and protein databases to distinguish biologically significant relationships from chance similarities (Smith and Waterman, 1981; Waterman, 1984; Pearson and Lipman, 1988; Altschul et al., 1990, Altschul et al., 1997; Tatiana and Thomas, 1999). The dynamic programming algorithms (Smith and Waterman, 1981; Waterman, 1984) assign scores to insertions, deletions and replacement, and compute an alignment of two sequences. These algorithms are impractical for searching large database because of their computational requirements. Rapid heuristic algorithms (Pearson and Lipman, 1988; Altschul et al., 1990, Altschul et al., 1997) compare protein and DNA sequences much faster than the above methods. They are widely used for large database searches. However, a number of important scientific contexts involve the comparison of only two sequences and do not require a time-consuming database search. In order to meet these needs, many important tools for large database searches (Tatiana and Thomas, 1999; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/index.html; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi) are further developed to employ global alignment of 2 protein and nucleotide sequences. These methods can provide the global profile of similarity degree. Recently, many graphical methods have also been used to examine the global similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences of different species (Qi et al., 2007; Qi and Qi, 2007, Qi and Qi, 2009; Qi and Fan, 2007; Yao et al., 2006, Yao et al., 2008a, Yao et al., 2008b; Randi\u0107 et al., 2003a, Randi\u0107 et al., 2003b). Because of the advantages in visualization, graphical methods have become a powerful bioinformatics tool for the analysis of complicated biological systems, such as enzyme-catalyzed system (Chou et al., 1979; Chou, 1980; Chou and Forsen, 1980, Chou and Forsen, 1981; Chou and Liu, 1981; Myers and Palmer, 1985; Zhou and Deng, 1984; Chou, 1989, Chou, 1990; Kuzmic et al., 1992; Andraos, 2008), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990, Chou, 1993), condon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1994), HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition mechanisms (see Althaus et al., 1993a, Althaus et al., 1993b, Althaus et al., 1993c, as well as a review article (Chou et al., 1994)), base frequency distribution in the anti-sense strands (Chou et al., 1996) and classifying organisms (Sorimachi and Okayasu, 2008; Okayasu and Sorimachi, 2009; Qi et al., 2009). Recently, the images of cellular automata were used to represent biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a), predict protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a), investigate HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b) and HBV viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006b), predicting protein structural classes (Xiao et al., 2008) and G-protein-coupled receptor functional classes (Xiao et al., 2009), as well as analyze the fingerprint of SARS coronavirus (Wang et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2006).",

Some graphical descriptions are also used to intuitively explain the scheme. The method consists of three parts: (i) simple alignment algorithm, (ii) extension algorithm for largest common substring, (iii) graphical simple alignment tree (GSA tree). Here, we firstly obtain a 2-dimension (2D) graphical curve by graphical representation of scores of DNA sequences. A good simple alignment of the DNA sequences is generated when the score of the scoring curve reaches its peak value. The 2D graphical curve can intuitively show the global change of simple alignment scores based on scoring matrix. Then the largest common substrings of the good simple alignment are found out. Because of the limit of the initial alignment reaching peak score, the largest common substrings of original two sequences may be split by the largest common substrings of the good simple alignment. In order to protect these common substrings from being split, an extension algorithm for the largest common substring is suggested. Then all largest common substrings are found out when the initial alignment reaches peak score. The process is repeatedly done until GSA tree comes into being. The tree can facilitate solving the problem for global alignment of 2 DNA sequences. At last, we give several practical examples to illustrate the utility and practicality of the approach.",

Similarly, every possible identity and substitution in alignments of related DNA sequences is also assigned a score. However, the scoring matrix in alignment of DNA sequences is relatively simple and intuitional. Table 1\nis a scoring matrix. An identity in scoring matrix is assigned a positive score R\n(R>0). A substitution is assigned a positive score S\n(S>0). But the score S must be subtracted from the total score of an alignment.

Let C be the largest common substrings of R, where C=\u03d5\u222a{C1,C2,\u2026,Cm}. If C=\u03d5, there is no largest common substring. When C={C1,C2,\u2026,Cm}, there are m largest common substrings, where |C1|=|C2|=\u22ef=|Cm|=k and k denotes the number of matches within a largest common substring. Here, we can see that the largest common substring Ci (i=1,2,\u2026,m) of R devotes its maximal score to the initial alignment reaching peak score. The alignment shows the approximate overall alignment feature of G\n1 and G\n2. However, some Ci of the largest common substrings of R may be a part of a larger common substring than Ci because of the limit of the initial alignment reaching peak score. In order to protect a larger common substring than Ci from being split by Ci and find out the substring, an extension algorithm for the largest common substring is suggested as the following.(1)Let K be the length of the largest common substring of G\n1 and G\n2. Its value is generated when the simple alignment algorithm applies to the sequences G\n1 and G\n2.(2)When k=K, none of the largest common substrings Ci of R can be extended into larger common substring. The largest common substrings of R are, C1,C2,\u2026Cm.(3)When k<K, there exists at least a larger common substring than Ci. There are several sub-steps to find out the larger common substrings as the following:(a)Let LL be the number of mismatches from the right end of Ci\u22121 to the left end of Ci. When i=1, LL denotes the number of mismatches from the left end of G\n1 and G\n2 to the left end of C\n1. Similarly, let LR be the number of mismatches from the right end of Ci to the left end of Ci+1. When i=1, LR denotes the number of mismatches from the right end of C\n1 to the right end of G\n1 and G\n2.(b)When K<LL, the K mismatches are extracted from the left of Ci. Otherwise, the LL mismatches are extracted from the left of Ci. Similarly, when K<LR, the K mismatches are extracted from the right of Ci. Otherwise, the LR mismatches are extracted from the right of Ci. Then the sequences extracted from the left of Ci, Ci and from the right of Ci are connected into two new sub-sequences Si1 and Si2.(c)Now, we apply the simple alignment algorithm to Si1 and Si2. If there exist a new larger common substring within Si1 and Si2 than Ci, we will face a choice: the new larger common substring or Ci. If there is an increment of sore when the new larger common substring comes into being, we will replace the original Ci with the new substring also called as Ci.\n(4)As for every Ci of R, the original Ci is replaced by the new largest common substring if the new substring exists.\n",

As for the first area, GSA tree obtains 7 matches by 3 gap openings and 5 gap extensions while needle gets 6 matches by 2 gap openings and 8 gap extensions. In the second area GSA tree gets 5 matches by 1 gap openings and 0 gap extensions while needle obtains 7 matches by 2 gap openings and 3 gap extensions. From the global view, GSA tree receives 31 matches by 7 gap openings and 7 gap extensions while needle gets 32 matches by 7 gap openings and 13 gap extensions. However, it is difficult for us to determine which one is the better when it comes to the best global alignment of the sequences considered. In fact, a close look at the alignments discovers that both of the methods can find out those very similar local areas, such as the bold areas of the alignments.",

Here, we apply the proposed method to the complete coding sequence part of beta globin gene of Human (ACCESSION U01317) and Opossum (ACCESSION J03643) as shown in Table 4\n. The scoring equation is R0*R\u2212S0*S\u2212T0*(a+bk), where identity score R is 9, substitution score S is 1, gap existence penalty a is 15, and gap extension penalty b is 1. For simplification, we do not show the detail of GSA tree and the results of all substrings. In Fig. 7\n, we illustrate the final result. The notation \u201c\u2010\u201d denotes the gap within sequence. According to the figure, we can obtain some conclusions of the global alignment between string G\n1 (the complete coding sequence of ACCESSION U01317) and string G\n2 (the complete coding sequence of ACCESSION J03643): Length: 448; Identities: 328/448 (73.2%); Gaps: 8/448 (1.8%); Score: 2772. Then we apply the web tool for \u201cneedle\u201d program to G\n1 and G\n2. The conclusions about the global alignment is the following: Length: 448; Identities: 328/448 (73.2%); Gaps: 8/448 (1.8%); Score: 1128.0. From the global view, the two methods almost get the same statistics results except for their scores. There is only one different area: the bases from 33 to 34 by GSA tree vs. the bases from 33 to 34 by needle. In fact, the two different areas are equivalent to each other. This example shows that it is possible to use the GSA tree in order to facilitate solving long and very similar DNA sequence alignment problem.",

Then in an optimal alignment of G\n1 and G\n2 (This hypothetical alignment may be obtained by an absolutely optimized algorithm), the two sequences of Ci by GSA tree might be entirely overlapping in the optimal alignment, or partially overlapping, or one sequence might be entirely isolated from the other.

As the sequences under comparison are protein coding, gaps with lengths other than multiples of three are highly unlikely, whereas the GSA tree algorithm can avoid many single or two-base gaps by the approximate approach. Unlike \u201cEMBOSS Pairwise Alignment Algorithms\u2014needle (global)\u201d or \u201c\u2014water (local)\u201d, the proposed GSA tree algorithm is to find a balance between the global and local. The algorithm is for aligning two sequences over their entire length. The match areas with local superiority are produced in the global context. In bioinformatics, it may be reasonable to assume that in the global context the local areas with closely related sequences should be reflected because of the stability of these areas. As for two possibly related sequences, giving priority to these local areas may be a better choice. The accurate optimization result could not show these local features because of the global optimization. The proposed GSA tree algorithm is for aligning two sequences over their entire length. This works best with closely related sequences. If one uses GSA tree to align very distantly related sequences, it will produce a result but much of the alignment may have little or no biological significance. The three examples of 4.1 give practical proofs for the validity and practicality of the GSA tree algorithm. The Example 1 gives two very similar but very short sequences. The GSA tree achieves the same results as needle. The Example 3 gives two similar and long sequences. There is only one different area: \n",

Because of the limit of the initial alignment reaching peak score, some Ci of the largest common substrings of R may be a part of a larger common substring than Ci. Then an extension algorithm for the largest common substring is suggested to protect a larger common substring than Ci from being split by Ci if the larger common substring exists. In the extension algorithm we introduce three parameters: K, LL and LR, where K be the length of the largest common substring of G1 and G2. When k=K(k=|Ci|), none of the largest common substrings Ci of R can be extended into larger common substring. The largest common substrings of R are C1,C2,\u2026,Cm, respectively. There is no larger common substring than Ci split by Ci. Otherwise, when k<K, there exists at least a larger common substring than Ci. The larger common substring and Ci might be partially overlapping, or one might be entirely isolated from the other. When they are entirely isolated from each other, the larger common substring can be completely preserved and found out in the next sub-alignment. As for being partially overlapping, we face a choice: the larger common substring or Ci. In order to give a better choice, we use parameters K, LL and LR to construct two new sub-sequences Si1 and Si2. We will replace the original Ci with the new substring also called as Ci if there is an increment of sore when the new larger common substring comes into being. So we can protect a larger common substring than Ci1 from being split by Ci1 and eliminate the limitations caused by the only initial alignment reaching peak score.",
