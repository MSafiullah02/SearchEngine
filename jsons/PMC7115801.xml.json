Cryptosporidium has been shown to be the most commonly detected (53.7%) of the four major enteropathogens (rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) that cause neonatal diarrhoea found in young diarrhoeic calves (Uhde et al., 2008). Evidence that farm animal and environmental contact contributes to zoonotic transmission routes was evidenced through a 40% reduction in confirmed human cryptosporidiosis cases in England and Wales during a period of Foot and Mouth Disease control measures, which included public access restrictions to the countryside (Sopwith et al., 2005). However, a combined effect with improvements in drinking water quality has been considered. The importance of understanding and controlling Cryptosporidium is highlighted as there is also growing anecdotal evidence of Cryptosporidium infections as a problem in the beef industry, in both calves and adults, within the UK and particularly in Scotland (Hateley, pers. comm.). There have been no large scale on-farm Cryptosporidium prevalence studies of cattle in the United Kingdom and this was deemed an important gap in the understanding of this parasite and the risk to people coming into contact via food or environmental contact.",

Species of Cryptosporidium have varying host species, with Cryptosporidium parvum being particularly important to epidemiologists as it infects a wide range of animals and also people. The zoonotic transmission of C. parvum via direct animal contact has been demonstrated and reported (Casemore, 1990, Elwin et al., 2001), but the risk of disease through indirect contact with animal faeces or from environmental exposure is unmeasured. Previous evidence for the existence of different subtypes of Cryptosporidium species, along with their zoonotic capabilities and potential reservoir host range, has been demonstrated (Xiao et al., 2001, Pritchard et al., 2007, Chalmers and Giles, 2010, Smith et al., 2010).",

The contributions of wild animal and bird populations to the environmental load were also investigated. Molecular tools were used, capable of determining all species of Cryptosporidium, to determine the extent of the presence of different species on the farms, and subtyping tools were used to further discriminate those of primary zoonotic importance and assess the potential transmission risk to people and farm animals. The identification of Cryptosporidium species of veterinary importance was considered essential as, although some may not be a risk to public health, infection in calves adversely affects farm productivity. This study aimed to inform the development of interventions that would be of use to the farmer in disrupting transmission routes or potential reservoirs of infection, while also helping to determine areas of greatest risk to the public entering farm land for recreational purposes.",

Samples represented the risk of infection from a particular wildlife species, such as birds, foxes, deer and rodents (counting birds as a single species) in a particular house or field where calf samples had been collected. As much faecal material as possible, pooled from the same location and the same species, was collected in each sample pot. Pre-moistened, sterile Readiwipes were used to collect bird samples. (2) Co-grazing sheep (maximum. 10 samples). Fresh (voided) faeces were collected from sheep that were co-grazed with cattle. If sheep were co-grazed on more than one field, then the 10 samples were divided between the fields roughly in proportion to the size of the sheep groups in each. If no co-grazed sheep were present then no samples were collected. (3) Manure (maximum. 2 pooled samples). Samples were taken from two composting/stacked manure heaps to which calves and youngstock had most recently contributed. At four separate locations on the heap, surface weathered manure was pulled away and then material removed to a depth of 10\u201320 cm. Two \u201cpinches\u201d (approx. 4 g) of manure were collected per hole, with a final pinch of surface material. If the farm had only one heap, a second pooled sample was not required. (4) Dirty water (maximum 3 samples). Sampling areas were the milking parlour drain, outside drain that contributes to the farm's dirty water and drains in areas of animal accommodation or collecting yard. The liquid in the drain was mixed well using a plastic rod. The rod was wiped with 70% ethanol and thoroughly rinsed with water between successive samples and a new rod used for each farm. Up to 1 L of drain liquid was collected. (5) Spread slurry (maximum. 5 samples). Five sampling areas were identified (e.g. top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right and centre) in a pasture field used for grazing where slurry had been spread in the last month. If more than one pasture field had been spread in the past month, then the most recently spread field was selected. The areas of the pasture field selected for sampling were preferably damp, shaded areas where slurry had been visibly spread. From each of the 5 areas, a 2 m \u00d7 2 m section was selected and a sample (approximately 5 g) of residual manure or surface material (topsoil or visually contaminated grass) was collected from 10 points in the section, by scraping to a depth of no more than 2.5 cm. The pooled sample from the 10 positions was mixed. If no slurry has been spread in the past month then no samples were collected.",

Eight farms had only one species result detected (including the farm which had one sample tested). One farm had five Cryptosporidium species detected: Cryptosporidium bovis (from weaned and new born calves); C. parvum (new born calves); Cryptosporidium ryanae (new born calves); Cryptosporidium ubiquitum (rats); and unclear pattern (new born and weaned calves). A Cryptosporidium baileyi was detected in a sample from a calf group and confirmed by sequencing. However, the novel detection of this species in cattle could not be verified, as the sample was from floor faeces and could have been contaminated by another source.",

A trend of decreasing prevalence with increasing age of the cattle was observed. Another study in the same area showed a prevalence rate of 28% in young calves at any one time (Brook et al., 2008) which is lower than seen in other EU countries where 47.9% prevalence rates have been reported in beef and dairy calves under 22 days of age (Castro Hermida et al., 2002). The risk to people from young calves is higher as young calves were also more likely to be shedding C. parvum which is the species responsible for up to 50% of human cases (Chalmers et al., 2009), and young calves were found to be shedding larger concentrations of oocysts in the faeces samples. However, if the calves are housed indoors then the risk is predominantly to the handlers rather than the general public. Older calves and adult cattle were more likely to be shedding C. bovis and C. andersoni, respectively, for which the public health/zoonotic risk is low, although there is still a risk from those older calves and cattle shedding C. parvum.

The high prevalence agrees with a longitudinal study completed on a single UK farm which showed the prevalence in small wild mammals (mainly rodents) living in and around farm buildings as 32.8% and living in areas of pasture as 29.9% (Sturdee et al., 2003).

Cryptosporidium was found in dirty water and manure sources, and was also detected in some pasture samples where slurry had been spread. C. parvum was detected in dirty water and manure samples, and although C. parvum was not detected in a small number of microscopy-positive soil samples, the presence of a Cryptosporidium species detected in the cattle on the farm shows that this transmission route may be a risk to people who have contact with pasture. However, we are unable to state whether all Cryptosporidium positive waste samples were viable. Due to the larger quantities of farm waste that would generally be produced by adult cattle rather than calves, it is interesting that it was the Cryptosporidium species rarely found in adults that was mostly detected in the waste. Soil can be difficult to process using molecular techniques as it may contain inhibitory factors, although it has been shown that up to 17% of 782 soil samples taken from dairy farms in the USA contain Cryptosporidium oocysts (Barwick et al., 2003). This environmental risk is particularly important in England and Wales, where the public have greater access to farm land than in many other countries (Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000). It is interesting that the number of human cases from contact with recreational water is increasing (Yoder et al., 2012) and this may be related to run off from waste contaminating waterways. It may reasonably be concluded that muck heap management and slurry management prior to spreading can be considered an intervention point to reduce environmental contamination with benefits to both veterinary and public health.",

This may indicate a circulating effect of Cryptosporidium within farms, possibly with staff indirectly carrying contaminated faeces between buildings and wild birds moving between buildings and contaminating the environment via their faeces, or it could demonstrate persistence on the farm. However, the two farms with birds and cattle with matching subtypes were both IIaA15G2R1, which is the most common subtype found in this study and in the published literature. It should be noted that few human samples have been analysed using GP60 subtyping both in the UK and around the World and so the subtypes not currently reported in human populations should not be regarded as non-zoonotic subtypes, as they may just be rarer or not detected yet.",

However, the majority of enrolled farms were randomly selected from the study areas and no difference was found between participating farms and those that declined participation, and so it is believed that these farms were generally representative of the cattle farm population. Regional differences in climate and possibly management may occur in England and Wales, and although the study covered areas of high cattle herd density, the results may not represent all of the dairy farms in England and Wales. Collecting voided faeces rather than individual rectal samples may have biased the results, with the possibility that faeces from a single animal may be overrepresented from the samples from that pen. However, sampling the freshest faeces from a number of locations within the enclosure should have limited this possibility.",

The results have also highlighted that Cryptosporidium contamination by rodents and birds may be a route of transmission to cattle and that Cryptosporidium survived well in farm waste and was detected in soil samples where waste had been spread, indicating another route of Cryptosporidium transmission between cattle and a possible risk to the general public. These findings should help inform biosecurity practices on the farm and guide advice to visitors and staff who may have contact with young calves.",
