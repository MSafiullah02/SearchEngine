We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks linked with breaking the transfer circuit to link the patient to the theatre ventilator. We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea. We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer. We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this. We summarise the steps in our protocol in an \"easy to reproduce\" way. Finally, we emphasise the importance of communication in a constantly changing environment and challenging circumstances.",

We consider this a critical step. ICU patients have padded ET tube ties to secure the tube for long periods whilst preventing pressure sores. These can be cumbersome, therefore the anaesthetist removes them prior to the procedure and places an easy to release ET tube tie. Prep and drape is standard; however we ensure that the ET tube and oral cavity is draped over and is only accessible to the anaesthetist to allow for manoeuvring during the tracheostomy.

Prior to making the tracheal window, we request the anaesthetist to stop the ventilator and deflate the balloon/cuff. Afterwards, the surgeon makes the window in the trachea. Minimal suctioning is used. Once the window is achieved the ET tube is advanced further (past the window) and the balloon/cuff is re-inflated, 3 thus establishing a closed circuit. This is a critical step. It is important to recognise that the patient is at significant risk of alveolar derecruitment and may require aggressive recruitment after re-inflation of the cuff. We found that this was best achieved with two anaesthetists; one to manipulate the ET tube and one to manage the ventilator.",

This allows the trachea to be brought close to the skin if the tracheostomy tube becomes dislodged. 3 The ventilator is then stopped again, the cuff is deflated and the ET tube is withdrawn slowly to allow the insertion of the tracheostomy and inner tube. The tracheostomy cuff is inflated and the circuit is connected. The capnography CO 2 trace is confirmed. We do not scope the tracheostomy, unless there is an absolute need. The ET tube is simultaneously clamped while the tracheostomy is being placed. This is a critical step. It is important to remember that the patient has technically been extubated and for this reason 20 minutes needs to pass to allow re circulation before doffing. The anaesthetic nurse documents this time. The tracheostomy tube is secured with sutures. A closed suctioning is attached to the tracheostomy tube and suctioning can then be performed.",

Our experience has allowed us to identify some critical steps that we have introduced to make this procedure safer for all involved. We have also framed the process in 5 distinct domains. It has to be recognised that these procedures are time consuming given all the steps involved and good communication can minimise unnecessary time stoppages and improve human factors. We have also recognised that due to staff self-isolating, regular head and neck scrub staff may not be available. This can also add challenges and reinforces the need for good communication and reproducible steps. We believe that our approach is safe and easily reproducible and we welcome comments towards improvement.",
