Firms generate revenue from their business segments and investments, which are used for required spending to remain a going concern and discretionary spending to pursue opportunities and strategic objectives such as the construction of new vessels or secondhand purchases. Contractors use cash generated from operating activities to maintain their vessel fleet and personnel and other costs, and they supplement this with conventional bank loans and by entering the bond market to refinance and with stock offerings (if public) to raise capital.",

Integrated and diversified firms generate revenue from one or more business segments, which may act to smooth out the variation in cash flow across business cycles. Operators can idle or stack vessels to reduce operating cost, sell vessels that are not deemed strategic assets to raise revenue, or scrap vessels to remove them from the market.Example: Subsea 7 cash flow snapshots, 2016 versus 2019At the end of 2016 Subsea 7 had $1676 million on its balance sheet compared to $947 million at the end of 2015 (Fig. 8.2\n). Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization were $1142 million. Capital spending for the year for vessels and equipment and related long-term purchases was $300 million; repurchase of notes was $106 million, and taxes paid were $141 million.Cash on hand at July 1, 2019 was $420 million, and at September 30, 2019 was $367 million (Fig. 8.3\n). Tax paid, capital spending, acquisition cost, share repurchases, repayment of borrowing, and lease payments are depicted.

Legacy vessels are long-lived assets that generally have low reinvestment needs but are constrained in their ability to compete against newer vessels. Over any given period, vessel use may not result in adequate cash flows to pay off debt, in which case revolving bank loans may be needed or asset sales to meet obligations. If the daily revenue made by leasing a vessel exceeds its operating cost, the firm will choose to operate the vessel.\nBox 8.1Amazing Grace on the Way?Edward Heerema thinks big is better and may take another calculated gamble, this one costing about $3.5 billion. After building the world\u2019s largest construction vessel, the Pioneering Spirit (see Box 6.1), Heerema is considering building an even larger vessel with a greater lifting capacity to lift the heaviest, widest, and largest topsides in the world.There are at least a dozen large platforms in the Northern North Sea that cannot be removed in a single-lift using Pioneering Spirit, either because the topside weight exceeds her capacity (e.g., Troll, Gullfaks, Sleipner, and Oseburg) or the platform size is simply too large (e.g., Thistle, Magnus, and Dunlin). These and several other large platforms worldwide continue to entice Mr. Heerema, who sees a business opportunity, albeit a risky one.While the new vessel is still only a concept, Heerema indicated that Allseas was expected to make an investment decision by 2022. Once, and if built, the sister vessel will dwarf its older brother both in size and in lifting capacity with a beam of 160 m and topside lifting capacity of 72,000 t. Amazing Grace is not being designed for pipelay operations, nor does it have a jacket-lifting system like Pioneering Spirit, so its primary function will be highly specialized for the single-lift removal/installation of topsides. The vessel will have to make its money on a handful of extreme projects. The question is whether the jobs Heerema lines up will generate enough cash flows to pay the debt schedule on the investment and reward shareholders.",

Several of the largest integrated construction contractors own and operate regional spoolbases to fabricate rigid and flexible pipeline to better compete for installation contracts (Box 8.2\n).\nBox 8.2Gulf of Mexico Spoolbase FacilitiesA spoolbase is a shore-based facility used to weld steel pipe for spooling onto a reel-lay or construction vessel. Locations are chosen based on demand requirements, access to a skilled workforce, channel length and depth, and connectivity to road, sea, and air transportation. In the Gulf of Mexico, buildings should be situated near the coastline and built for potential storm surge. Properties need to be long and close to deep navigational channels.SpoolbasesSpoolbase facilities in the Gulf of Mexico c.2020 are found in Brownsville, Texas (Subsea 7); Mobile, Alabama (McDermott); and Theodore, Alabama (TechnipFMC). Facilities are owned by construction contractors that serve the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and typically employ 50\u2013100 permanent workers at each location, mostly high-paying welders (Table 8.1\n). The investment to construct a yard depends on the facilities and site conditions.The Theodore, Alabama, spoolbase was constructed in 2000 for $10 million and sits on 130 ac near Mobile (Fig. 8.5\n). Port Isabel, on the Texas coast close to the Mexican border near Brownsville, is the site for Subsea 7\u2019s pipeline spoolbase, which was reported to cost $40 million in 2009 (Fig. 8.6\n). The facility covers 58 ac and is 5000 ft long, including a 4000-ft stalk rack and 1000-ft fabrication building. McDermott\u2019s facility started construction in 2014 and was operating in 2016 on a 50-ac site (Fig. 8.7\n).FabricationThe fabrication building houses the primary firing line and uses a hydraulic pipe pusher system to index pipe through the fabrication process and onto stalk storage racks. Pipe joints are beveled and girth welded together. Fabrication lines feature automatic, semi-automatic, and manual welding. Each weld is inspected using nondestructive examination techniques, usually automatic ultrasonic testing or radiography. Finally, field joint coating is applied after grit blasting and heating the weld region. This process continues until the pipe joints are assembled into a pipe stalk of approximately 1 km in length. The pipe stalks are stored until the reel-lay vessel is docked and ready for reeling.ReelingThe reeling process begins with spooling of the pipeline onto the vessel. A stalk is pulled from the spoolbase onto the vessel and then plastically bent in a controlled manner around the reel. The process continues until the second end of the stalk reaches the end of spoolbase causeway. The end of that stalk is then welded to the start of the next stalk. Nondestructive examination of the weld is performed, and the field joint coating is applied. The process is repeated until the required length of pipeline has been spooled onto the vessel reel(s).Quay and DockA quay and dock allow pipelay vessels to execute pipe spooling and mobilization of equipment and may also provide support to the company\u2019s fleet of construction vessels in the region. The length of the quayside and dredging requirements are primary factors in construction cost.",

Mergers and acquisitions can deliver a step change in asset base and value, but risk exists on consolidating business lines and creating the synergies to extract value from the larger company. How many mergers and acquisitions really deliver on their purported value and savings?

            "text": "Activity in the offshore oil and gas sector is dependent on commodity prices, which are volatile and unpredictable (Box 8.3\n). When oil and gas prices decline, offshore exploration activity responds and demand for services decline, but because of the long lead times and contract terms for offshore projects, there are typically longer delays between price signals and responses compared to onshore activity. Significant regional differences also exist in capital spending responses. For example, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the response is quicker in shallow water than in deepwater, and internationally where National Oil Companies are dominant (e.g., Brazil, Persian Gulf), the delay will typically be longer.\nBox 8.3A Few Words on Oil Markets and Crude PricesThe crude oil market is composed of a physical market and a financial market (Fig. 8.9\n). The oil market is separate and distinct from the products market and linked via the refining sector and the financial markets (Geman, 2005, Kaminski, 2012, Swindle, 2014). Thousands of producers, refiners, marketers, brokers, traders, and consumers buy and sell physical volumes of crude oil and petroleum products throughout the chain of production. These interactions and the relationships and expectations of the various buyers and sellers lead to the market prices for current and future deliveries of oil.Before 1900 crude oil prices were largely driven by the cost of transporting the crude to refining markets, not by commercial demand for refined products or for that matter even the cost of crude production. Kerosene for lamp oil was the primary demand, and gasoline was considered a nuisance (waste) by-product and was disposed of or burned off at the refinery. Heavy oil products were used for paving and lubricants and represented the beginning of the asphalt and lube industries. Crude prices were highly volatile during this period because supply was constrained, and product markets were few and developing (Fig. 8.10\n). At the time, individual fields could make a significant difference in the level of supply.Today, the capital invested by companies and their success in finding and developing oil deposits are a critical ingredient in the supply of crude oil, and thus, the ability to meet consumer product demand, but there are many other factors that are equally important in determining prices. Political and socioeconomic events created by economic growth and depression, wars, terrorism, natural disasters, and other unpredictable events also play a significant role in price formation and dynamics. Since the occurrence, duration, and impact of world events are unknowable, price volatility is an inherent aspect of all commodity markets (Geman, 2005, Hermann et al., 2010). No one knows\u2014or should pretend to know for that matter\u2014the future price of crude oil.Crude oil and petroleum products are global commodities, and as such, their prices are determined primarily by supply and demand factors on a worldwide basis (Kenny, 2011). There are periods when the price of oil is relatively stable, and other periods when the price is highly volatile and changing quickly. For some periods, governments and organizations have been able to control prices to reduce volatility, but for much of the history of the oil market, the success of price control has been limited. In 2020, the impact of the latest and greatest Chinese virus, SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-19), has caused significant market disruptions and hardships worldwide, and its full effect on oil prices over the next year or two is likely to be significant.Crude oil prices react to a variety of geopolitical and economic events, but the extent and duration of the impacts are not predictable. Major drivers of high oil prices are generally recognized to be high global economic activity, resulting in crude demand exceeding or approaching supply; low levels of storage, which prevent shocks and market imbalances to be quickly absorbed; OPEC pricing decisions; and war/turmoil. Which factors are the most dominant at any point in time and to what extent they impact the market are subject to endless debate and speculation. In almost all cases, their effects cannot be quantified or reliably predicted, and efforts at forecasting are fanciful at best.Crude prices are also impacted by the business cycle that characterizes the capital investments required to find and develop crude oil. High prices create greater revenue for oil producers and allow companies to invest additional capital in exploration and development to find and produce more petroleum. At the same time, high crude prices are passed on to the consumer in higher product prices that reduce demand, thus reducing demand for crude oil and pressuring crude prices downward. The time delay between spending capital and producing crude and the cycle imbalance between supply and demand inevitably lead to changing market prices. Over the long term, additional factors enter and perturb the cycle, including technology changes, geopolitical events, regulatory conditions, and so on.",
