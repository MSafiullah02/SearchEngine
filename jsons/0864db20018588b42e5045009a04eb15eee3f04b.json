Pathogenic agents of the disease, protozoan parasites including Cryptosporidium spp., are difficult to control, making prevention, diagnoses, and treatment of diarrhea. In the present study, we investigated a farm with a history of calf deaths over a period of 10 years in order to determine the cause of disease and to clarify the detailed distribution of the pathogens. In four examined calves that were reared in calf pens, all were positive with Cryptosporidium and/or Giardia, while the other breeding stock and adult cattle were negative. Molecular analyses revealed that the isolates from calves were C. parvum subtype IIaA15G2R1 as a zoonotic and G. intestinalis assemblage E. Other pathogenic bacteria and diarrhea-causing viruses were not detected. After treating the calf pens with boiling water and milk of lime (Ca[OH] 2 ), oocysts of C. parvum and cysts of G. intestinalis were not found and no additional calves died. This is the first report to describe the mixed infection of both parasites in Japan.",

The occurrence of disease can markedly affect the weight gain of livestock, resulting in economic loss due to reduced productivity or the need to administer therapeutic treatments (Cho and Yoon 2014) . Diarrhea is mainly caused by etiologic agents, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and rapid diagnosis of the cause followed by successful treatment is required (Meganck et al. 2014) . Namely, diarrhea can be the leading cause of mortality, especially before weaning, in both beef and dairy calves, although enteric diseases are often common in both adult and neonatal cattle (Lorenz et al. 2011) . Consequently, veterinarians and the farmers make great efforts to design rational and effective protocols for prevention as well as treatment of diarrhea (Smith 2015) .",

Cryptosporidiosis is caused by protozoan parasites of Cryptosporidium spp. that belong to phylum Apicomplexan and are characterized as a zoonotic disease causing watery diarrhea in humans, domestic, and companion animals, as well as cattle (Esch and Petersen 2013) . To date, cattle are known to be infected by at least five species of Cryptosporidium spp., namely, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium bovis, Cryptosporidium ryanae, and Cryptosporidium ubiqui-tum, which parasitize the small intestine, and Cryptosporidium andersoni, which parasitizes the abomasums (Ryan et al. 2014) . Transmission of the parasites is through fecal-oral routes and a large number of oocysts are shed in feces of infected hosts. These oocysts are resistant to disinfectants like chlorine bleach, and they can survive in environments for a long period of time (Chauret et al. 2001) . Currently, no effective treatments are available, and calves are the most susceptible to infection, with infection often leading to death.",

This parasite is a binucleated flagellated protozoan, and it consists two different stages, the trophozoite (vegetative form), which colonizes the host intestine, and the cyst (infective form), which is tolerant to environmental conditions (Carranza and Lujan 2010) . While epidemiological studies have shown the infectious agents to have a prevalence of 100% in beef and dairy cattle in some countries (O'Handley et al. 1999; Ralston et al. 2003) , distributions vary in other countries depending on management practices, climate and also the study design of the surveys. G. intestinalis genetically comprises eight genotypes (assemblages A-H, including A-I to A-IV of subtypes); assemblages A-I and B, a zoonotic genotype, and assemblage E, which is specific to livestock, are known to infect cattle (Ballweber et al. 2010; Heyworth 2016) . In most cases, cattle have been reported to harbor the infections caused by the non-zoonotic livestock genotype (assemblage E) (Appelbee et al. 2003) .",

The calves were administered toltrazuril at 3 to 5 days after birth, and symptomatic calves were given antibiotic treatments, such as oxytetracycline and sulfadimethoxine, transfusions to prevent metabolic acidosis, and management of the housing conditions, including thermal management were conducted.

A large number of yellowish-white granular nodules were observed at the cortex of the kidney. Yellow and slight muddy ascites were increased, and liver showed swelling and was surrounded with precipitated fibrin. Mesenteric lymph nodes showed swelling. Histopathological examination of the calf showed Cryptosporidium zoites at the surface of the intestinal crypt, and these reacted positively to anti-Cryptosporidium antibody (Fig. 3) . Additionally, abscesses including some masses of bacteria in the serous membrane and at the cortex of the kidney, and infiltration of neutrophil in the renal tubules were also observed (images not shown). As an additional survey to understand the prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasites, including C. parvum and G. intestinalis, we examined feces from all of the cattle on the farm. No oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. or cysts of G. intestinalis were identified from the examined cattle.",

However, sequential occurrences of frequent diarrhea or fatal cases on individual farms have rarely been reported, although only cases of calf deaths due to cryptosporidiosis were pathologically examined (De Cesaro et al. 2014) . At the farm examined in the present study, cases of diarrhea in calves had been occurring continuously for approximately ten years and resulted in some deaths; however, the causative agent had unfortunately not been determined by a livestock hygiene service center. As a simple method for detection, oocysts can be observed by showing a bright pink color in the sucrose floatation method as described in previous reports (Abe et al. 2002; Koompapong et al. 2009 ). Experts can easily detect oocysts by this method, and the results in this study were identical to those of immunofluorescence staining and PCR. However, because oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. are extremely small compared to eimerian oocysts, the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is often difficult, especially when parasitic specialists or commercial simple detection kits are not available. No bacterial or viral pathogens were detected on this farm and, therefore, in the present study, it is thought that C. parvum is the likely causative agent of the cases of diarrhea in calves in this farm over an extended time, although parasitological examination was not performed on previous cases of calves that died following diarrhea.",

To date, many subtypes of C. parvum have been recognized in the GP60 gene region. Interestingly, only subtype IIaA15G2R1 was detected in cattle in Japan (Ichikawa-Seki et al. 2015) and, therefore, our findings corroborate the report that this subtype is widespread in Japan. This subtype of C. parvum was found in humans, identifying it as a zoonotic one (Xiao 2010) . While infected cattle can be a source of infection to humans as well as other cattle, none of the farmers on this particular farm showed any signs of diarrhea. Assemblage E of G. intestinalis has been implicated in causing diarrhea in calves (Barigye et al. 2008; Gillhuber et al. 2014) , but other researchers have described this assemblage as being mostly asymptomatic (Liu et al. 2012) . Therefore, the pathogenicity of the assemblage remains unknown. In Japan, there are only two known reports of G. intestinalis infections in cattle (Itagaki et al. 2005; Mat-subayashi et al. 2005) , and thus, this is the third report of G. intestinalis infection in cattle and the first occurrence of the mixed infection of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. intestinalis in Japan.",
