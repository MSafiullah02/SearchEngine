We recently conducted a relevant cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 29 of 2020 in an attempt to supplement this area. A total of 1172 subjects completed online questionnaires from 133 cities, including demographical data and self-assessment results of the following 8 common mental Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, PCL-5). The ASDS was originally designed, but in the middle of the survey, we found that the PCL-5 was more suitable, so we replaced ASDS with PCL-5. As a result, 714 participants filled out ASDS, and the other 458 participants completed PCL-5. Our scale results showed that the incidence of most mental disorders was as follows: 18.8% of depression, 13.3% of anxiety, 7.6% of mental health problems, 2.8% of high risk of suicidal and behavior, 7.2% of clinical insomnia, and 7.0% of clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, while the incidence of moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress was 67.9%. Further, the temporal distribution showed that the overall fluctuation range of each mental state was relatively small, but on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, the psychological states of the subjects relatively deteriorated, especially on March 25.",
