The lack of an association with age can be explained by the narrow age range studied. Sociodemographic differences between Switzerland and other countries may be the reason that day care had no measurable influence on the microbiota. A potentially important factor could be concurrent infection with a respiratory virus. In a preliminary study, we analyzed 81 samples from infants with AOM collected from 2004 through 2006 for the presence of RNA viruses, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and bocavirus. The presence of any of these viruses did not have an effect on the microbiota, either on the prevalence or the abundance of bacterial families (data not presented). In agreement with our preliminary data, no evidence for an association between seasonal shifts in microbiota and the presence of respiratory viruses was found in healthy infants in the Netherlands [29] . However, additional studies are needed to explore the role of viruses in the microbiota in more detail.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study has limitations. Samples from infants with AOM were restricted to those collected during winter seasons because AOM incidence peaks during winter, and there was no information about diet, number of siblings, or parental smoking, which may all have an influence on the microbiota. The results from our study may therefore not apply to the summer season, as has been shown for healthy controls [29] . The number of controls was small, and samples were collected during a relatively short period after the introduction of PCV7 in a selected geographic region, compared with samples for infants with AOM. However, the results obtained for our control infants resembled closely those described in a recent Dutch study, as discussed above [29] . Another limitation of our study is the lack of high-quality quantitative data on colonization density, because the quantity of bacterial DNA in NPS specimens is very small, which impedes a reliable quantification of the microbiota directly in the sample. However, taking the DNA concentration of the PCR amplification product as a surrogate for colonization density has been described as a reasonable approach [18] . Our results suggest that colonization density is lower in bacterial communities of increased richness, such as the healthy microbiota in the controls. Increased quantities of nontypeable H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis have been observed in nasopharyngeal secretions during AOM, compared with the healthy status [33] . Therefore, the pathogenesis of AOM may include a disturbance of the interspecies balance with ensuing overgrowth of an AOM pathogen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 402, "end": 406, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 743, "end": 747, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1164, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study is the first to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiota of infants with and without AOM with use of molecular techniques.
