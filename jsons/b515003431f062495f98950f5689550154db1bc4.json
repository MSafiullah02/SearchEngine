Maternal outcome of the 13 cases: 4 cases had miscarriage, 2 opted for termination of pregnancy, 2 succumbed to SARS, 2 required mechanical ventilation, and 3 were treated conservatively. No neonatal adverse effect was noted except for 2 cases born prematurely e one at 28 weeks and the other at 26 weeks (Table 1 ). Maternal outcome of the 11 MERS-CoV cases: 2 were asymptomatic, 3 succumbed to MERS, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 3 were treated conservatively, and 1 refused treatment. No neonatal adverse effects were noted except for 2 intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) (one at 38 weeks and the other at 20 weeks) and 1 fetal death due to prematurity at 24 weeks gestation ( Table  2 ). The most important contributing factor for method of delivery in patients with SARS and MERS seems to be dependent on disease progression resulting in maternal hypoxia leading to fetal distress and prematurity. Neonatal infection due to possible vertical transmission was not detected in any of the SARS or MERS infection except for 1 SARS case in the United States where cord blood and breast milk were positive for the SARS-CoV antibody.",
