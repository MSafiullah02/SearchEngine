This sparked much controversy both before and after its inception. Critics questioned the usefulness of genomic sequencing, they objected to the high cost and suggested it might divert funds from other, more focused, basic research. The prime argument to support the latter position is that there appeared to be are far less genes than accounted for by the mass of DNA which would suggest that the major part of the sequencing effort would be of long stretches of base pairs with no known function, the so-called \"junk DNA.\" And that was in the days when the number of genes was presumed to be 80-100,000. If, at that stage, the estimated number was guessed to be closer to the actual estimate of 35-40,000 (later reduced to 20-25,000) this would have made the task seem even more foolhardy and less worthwhile to some. However, the ever-powerful incentive of new diagnostics and treatments for human disease beyond what could be gleaned from the gene-by-gene approach and the rapidly evolving technologies, especially that of automated sequencing, made it both an attractive and plausible aim.",

Even as the Soviet Union collapsed, a genome project survived as part of the Russian science program. The scale of the venture and the manageable prospect for pooling data via computer made sequencing the human genome a truly international initiative. In an effort to include developing countries in the project UNESCO assembled an advisory committee in 1988 to examine UNESCO's role in facilitating international dialogue and cooperation. A privately-funded Human Genome Organization (HUGO) had been founded in 1988 to coordinate international efforts and serve as a clearinghouse for data. In that same year the European Commission (EC) introduced a proposal entitled the \"Predictive Medicine Programme.\" A few EC countries, notably Germany and Denmark, claimed the proposal lacked ethical sensitivity; objections to the possible eugenic implications of the program were especially strong in Germany (Dickson 1989) . The initial proposal was dropped but later modified and adopted in 1990 as the \"Human Genome Analysis Programme\" (Dickman and Aldhous 1991) . This program committed substantial resources to the study of ethical issues. The need for an organization to coordinate these multiple international efforts quickly became apparent. Thus the Human Genome Organization (HUGO), which has been called the \"U.N. for the human genome,\" was born in the spring of 1988. Composed of a founding council of scientists from seventeen countries, HUGO's goal was to encourage international collaboration through coordination of research, exchange of data and research techniques, training, and debates on the implications of the projects (Bodmer 1991) .",

Regents of the University of California was the first case in the United States to address the issue of who owns the rights to an individual's cells. Diagnosed with leukemia, John Moore had blood and bone marrow withdrawn for medical tests. Suspicious of repeated requests to give samples because he had already been cured, Moore discovered that his doctors had patented a cell line derived from his cells and so he sued. The California Supreme Court found that Moore's doctor did not obtain proper informed consent, but, however, they also found that Moore cannot claim property rights over his body.",

There is no much doubt that when Applied Biosystems Inc. put it on the market that which had been a dream became decidedly closer to an achievable reality. In automating Sangers chain termination sequencing system, Hood modified both the chemistry and the data-gathering processes. In the sequencing reaction itself, he replaced radioactive labels, which were unstable, posed a health hazard, and required separate gels for each of the four bases. Hood developed chemistry that used fluorescent dyes of different colors for each of the four DNA bases. This system of \"color-coding\" eliminated the need to run several reactions in overlapping gels. The fluorescent labels addressed another issue which contributed to one of the major concerns of sequencing -data gathering. Hood integrated laser and computer technology, eliminating the tedious process of information-gathering by hand. As the fragments of DNA passed a laser beam on their way through the gel the fluorescent labels were stimulated to emit light. The emitted light was transmitted by a lens and the intensity and spectral characteristics of the fluorescence are measured by a photomultiplier tube and converted to a digital format that could be read directly into a computer. During the next thirteen years, the machine was constantly improved, and by 1999 a fully automated instrument could sequence up to 150,000,000 base pairs per year.",

The development of DNA Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs) to correlate diverse types of DNA clones aided this standardization of the mapping component by providing mappers with a common language and a system of landmarks for all the libraries from such varied sources as cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and other rDNAs clones. This way each mapped element (individual clone, contig, or sequenced region) would be defined by a unique STS. A crude map of the entire genome, showing the order and spacing of STSs, could then be constructed. The order and spacing of these unique identifier sequences composing an STS map was made possible by development of Mullis' polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allows rapid production of multiple copies of a specific DNA fragment, for example, an STS fragment.",

So using this approach projects were begun to mark gene sites on chromosome maps as sites of mRNA expression. To help with this a more efficient method of handling large chunks of sequences was needed and two approaches were developed. Yeast artificial chromosomes, which were developed by David Burke, Maynard Olson, and George Carle, increased insert size 10-fold (David T. Burke et al., 1987) . Caltech's second major contribution to the genome project was developed by Melvin Simon, and Hiroaki Shizuya. Their approach to handling large DNA segments was to develop \"bacterial artificial chromosomes\" (BACs), which basically allow bacteria to replicate chunks greater than 100,000 base pairs in length. This efficient production of more stable, large-insert BACs made the latter an even more attractive option, as they had greater flexibility than YACs. In 1994 in a collaboration that presages the SNP Consortium, Washington University, St Louis MO, was funded by the pharmaceutical company Merck and the National Cancer Institute to provide sequence from those ESTs. More than half a million ESTs were submitted during the project (Murr L et al., 1996) .",

The ultimate goal of the field is to enable the discovery of new biological insights as well as to create a global perspective from which unifying principles in biology can be discerned. There are three important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics: the development of new algorithms and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets; the analysis and interpretation of various types of data including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures; and the development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access and management of different types of information.",

On the data management side several databases with ever more effective storage and mining capabilities were developed over the same period. The first bioinformatic/biological databases were constructed a few years after the first protein sequences began to become available. The first protein sequence reported was that of bovine insulin in 1956, consisting of 51 residues. Nearly a decade later, the first nucleic acid sequence was reported, that of yeast alanine tRNA with 77 bases. Just one year later, Dayhoff gathered all the available sequence data to create the first bioinformatic database. One of the first dedicated databases was the Brookhaven Protein DataBank whose collection consisted of ten X-ray crystallographic protein structures (Acta. Cryst. B, 1973) . The year 1982 saw the creation of the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) as a part of the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The group's primary and much used product was the Wisconsin Suite of molecular biology tools. It was spun off as a private company in 1989. The SWISS-PROT database made its debut in 1986 in Europe at the Department of Medical Biochemistry of the University of Geneva and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).",

The emphasis of this tool is to find regions of sequence similarity, which will yield functional and evolutionary clues about the structure and function of this novel sequence. Regions of similarity detected via this type of alignment tool can be either local, where the region of similarity is based in one location, or global, where regions of similarity can be detected across otherwise unrelated genetic code. The fundamental unit of BLAST algorithm output is the High-scoring Segment Pair (HSP). An HSP consists of two sequence fragments of arbitrary but equal length whose alignment is locally maximal and for which the alignment score meets or exceeds a threshold or cutoff score. This system has been refined and modified over the years the two principal variants presently in use being the NCBI BLAST and WU-BLAST (WU signifying Washington University).",

Incyte Pharmaceuticals, a genomics company headquartered in Palo Alto, California, was formed and Myriad Genetics, Inc. was founded in Utah. Incyte's stated goal was to lead in the discovery of major common human disease genes and their related pathways. The company discovered and sequenced, with its academic collaborators (originally Synteni from Pat Brown's lab at Stanford), a number of important genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2, with Mary Claire King, epidemiologist at UC-Berkeley, the genes linked to breast cancer in families with a high degree of incidence before age 45. By 1992 a low-resolution genetic linkage map of the entire human genome was published and U.S. and French teams completed genetic maps of both mouse and man. The mouse with an average marker spacing of 4.3 cM as determined by Eric Lander and colleagues at Whitehead and the human, with an average marker spacing of 5 cM by Jean Weissenbach and colleagues at CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine). The latter institute was the subject of a rather scathing book by Paul Rabinow (1999) based on what they did with this genome map. In 1993, an American biotechnology company, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, and the CEPH, developed plans for a collaborative effort to discover diabetes genes. The results of this collaboration could have been medically significant and financially lucrative. The two parties had agreed that CEPH would supply Millennium with germplasm collected from a large coterie of French families, and Millennium would supply funding and expertise in new technologies to accelerate the identification of the genes, terms to which the French government had agreed. But in early 1994, just as the collaboration was to begin, the French government cried halt! The government explained that the CEPH could not be permitted to give the Americans that most precious of substances for which there was no precedent in law -French DNA. Rabinow's book discusses the tangled relations and conceptions such as, can a country be said to have its own genetic material, the first but hardly the last Franco-American disavowal of d\u00e9tente (Paul Rabinow, 1999) .",

Ultimately, while he proclaimed to like the security and service infrastructure this institute afforded him, that same system became too restrictive for his interests and talent. He wanted the whole canvas of human-gene expression to be his universe, not just what was confined to the central nervous system. He was becoming more interested in taking a whole genome approach to understanding the overall structure of genomes and genome evolution, which was much broader than the mission of NINDS. He noted, with some irony, in later years that the then current NIH director Harold Varmus had wished in hindsight that NIH had pushed to do a similar database in the public domain, clearly in Venter's opinion Varmus was in need of a refresher course in history! Bernadine Healy, NIH director in 1994, was one of the few in a leadership role who saw the technical and fiscal promise of Venter's work and, like all good administrators, it also presented an opportunity to resolve a thorny \"personnel\" issue. She appointed him head of the ad hoc committee to have an intramural genome program at NIH to give the head of the HGP (that other larger than life personality Jim Watson) notice that he was not the sole arbitrator of the direction for the Human Genome Project. However Venter very soon established himself as an equally non-conformist character and with the tacit consent of his erstwhile benefactor.",

He moved on to become president and director of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), a nonprofit research center based in Gaithersburg, Md. At the same time William Haseltine formed a sister company, Human Genome Sciences (HGS), to commercialize TIGR products. Venter continued EST work at TIGR, but also began thinking about sequencing entire genomes. Again, he came up with a quicker and faster method: whole genome shotgun sequencing. He applied for an NIH grant to use the method on Hemophilus influenzae, but started the project before the funding decision was returned. When the genome was nearly complete, NIH rejected his proposal saying the method would not work. In a triumphal flurry in late May 1995 and with a metaphorical nose-thumbing at his recently rejected \"unworkable\" grant Venter announced that TIGR and collaborators had fully sequenced the first free-living organism -Haemophilus influenzae. In November 1994, controversy surrounding Venter's research escalated. Access restrictions associated with a cDNA database developed by TIGR and its Rockville, Md.-based biotech associate, Human Genome Sciences (HGS) Inc. -including HGS's right to preview papers on resulting discoveries and for first options to license products -prompted Merck and Co.

In December 1995, U.S. researcher Robert Gallo, the co-discoverer of HIV, and colleagues found three chemicals that inhibit the AIDS virus but they did not know how the chemicals work. In February 1996, Edward Berger at the NIH discovered that Gallo's inhibitors work in late-stage AIDS by blocking a receptor on the surface of T-cells. In June of that year in a period of just 10 days, five groups of scientists published papers saying CCR5 is the receptor for virtually all strains of HIV. In January 2000, Schering-Plough researchers told a San Francisco AIDS conference that they have discovered new inhibitors. They knew that Merck researchers had made similar discoveries. As a significant Valentine in 2000 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) grants HGS a patent on the gene that makes CCR5 and on techniques for producing CCR5 artificially. The decision sent HGS stock flying and dismayed researchers. It also caused the USPTO to revise its definition of a \"patentable\" drug target.",

The California Hereditary Disorders Act came into force and with it one of the potential solutions for human hereditary disorders. W. French Anderson in the USA reported the first successful application of gene therapy in humans. The first successful gene therapy for a human disease was successfully achieved for Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) by introducing the missing gene, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) into the peripheral lymphocytes of a 4-year-old girl and returning modified lymphocytes to her. Although the results are difficult to interpret because of the concurrent use of polyethylene glycol-conjugated ADA commonly referred to as pegylated ADA (PGLA) in all patients, strong evidence for in vivo efficacy was demonstrated. ADA-modified T cells persisted in vivo for up to three years and were associated with increases in T-cell number and ADA enzyme levels, T cells derived from transduced PGLA were progressively replaced by marrow-derived T cells, confirming successful gene transfer into long-lived progenitor cells. Ashanthi DeSilva, the girl who received the first credible gene therapy, continues to do well more than a decade later. Cynthia Cutshall, the second child to receive gene therapy for the same disorder as DeSilva, also continues to do well. Within 10 years (by January 2000), more than 350 gene therapy protocols had been approved in the US and worldwide, researchers launched more than 400 clinical trials to test gene therapy against a wide array of illnesses. Surprisingly, a disease not typically heading the charts of heritable disorders, cancer has dominated the research. In 1994 cancer patients were treated with the tumor necrosis factor gene, a natural tumor fighting protein which worked to a limited extent. Even more surprisingly, after the initial flurry of success little has worked. Gene therapy, the promising miracle of 1990 failed to deliver on its early promise over the decade.",

This gene, called the CF transmembrane conductance regulator, codes for an ion channel protein that regulates salts in the lung tissue. The faulty gene prevents cells from excreting salt properly causing a thick sticky mucus to build up and destroy lung tissue. Scientists have spliced copies of the normal genes into disabled adeno viruses that target lung tissues and have used bronchioscopes to deliver them to the lungs. The procedure worked well in animal studies however clinical trials in humans were not an unmitigated success. Because the cells lining the lungs are continuously being replaced the effect is not permanent and must be repeated. Studies are underway to develop gene therapy techniques to replace other faulty genes.

Enzymes were important agents in food production long before modern biotechnology was developed. They were used, for instance, in the clotting of milk to prepare cheese, the production of bread and the production of alcoholic beverages. Nowadays, enzymes are indispensable to modern food processing technology and have a great variety of functions. They are used in almost all areas of food production including grain processing, milk products, beer, juices, wine, sugar and meat. Chymosin, known also as rennin, is a proteolytic enzyme whose role in digestion is to curdle or coagulate milk in the stomach, efficiently converting liquid milk to a semisolid like cottage cheese, allowing it to be retained for longer periods in a neonate's stomach. The dairy industry takes advantage of this property to conduct the first step in cheese production. Chy-Max\u2122, an artificially produced form of the chymosin enzyme for cheese-making, was approved in 1990.",

Unlike crops industrial enzymes have had relatively easy passage to acceptance for a number of reasons. As noted they are part of the processing system and theoretically do not appear in the final product. Today about 90% of the hard cheese in the US and UK is made using chymosin from geneticallymodified microbes. It is easier to purify, more active (95% as compared to 5%) and less expensive to produce (Microbes are more prolific, more productive and cheaper to keep than calves). Like all enzymes it is required only in very small quantities and because it is a relatively unstable protein it breaks down as the cheese matures. Indeed, if the enzyme remained active for too long it would adversely affect the development of the cheese, as it would degrade the milk proteins to too great a degree. Such enzymes have gained the support of vegetarian organizations and of some religious authorities.",

When the nineties dawned dicotyledonous plants were relatively easily transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens but many economically important plants, including the cereals, remained inaccessible for genetic manipulation because of lack of effective transformation techniques. In 1990 this changed with the technology that overcame this limitation. Michael Fromm, a molecular biologist at the Plant Gene Expression Center, reported the stable transformation of corn using a high-speed gene gun. The method known as biolistics uses a \"particle gun\" to shoot metal particles coated with DNA into cells. Initially a gunpowder charge subsequently replaced by helium gas was used to accelerate the particles in the gun. There is a minimal disruption of tissue and the success rate has been extremely high for applications in several plant species. The technology rights are now owned by DuPont. In 1990 some of the first of the field trials of the crops that would dominate the second half of the nineties began, including Bt corn (with the Bacillus thuriengenesis Cry protein discussed in chapter three).",

That technology, antisense technology works because nucleic acids have a natural affinity for each other. When a gene coding for the target in the genome is introduced in the opposite orientation, the reverse RNA strand anneals and effectively blocks expression of the enzyme. This technology was patented by Calgene for plant applications and was the technology behind the famous FLAVR SAVR tomatoes. The first success for antisense in medicine was in 1998 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the go-ahead to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) inhibitor fomivirsen, a phosphorothionate antiviral for the AIDS-related condition CMV retinitis making it the first drug belonging to Isis, and the first antisense drug ever, to be approved.",

(Breeders had already created virusresistant tomato seeds by using traditional techniques.) And the method of protection still remained a mystery when the first approvals were given in 1994 and 1996. Gene silencing was perceived initially as an unpredictable and inconvenient side effect of introducing transgenes into plants. It now seems that it is the consequence of accidentally triggering the plant's adaptive defense mechanism against viruses and transposable elements. This recently discovered mechanism, although mechanistically different, has a number of parallels with the immune system of mammals. How this system worked was not elucidated until later in the decade by a researcher who was seeking a very different holy grail -the black rose! Rick Jorgensen, at that time at DNA Plant Technologies in Oakland, CA and subsequently of, of the University of California Davis attempted to overexpress the chalcone synthase gene by introducing a modified copy under a strong promoter.Surprisingly he obtained white flowers, and many strange variegated purple and white variations in between. This was the first demonstration of what has come to be known as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). While initially it was considered a strange phenomenon limited to petunias and a few other plant species, it is now one of the hottest topics in molecular biology. RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and basal eukaryotes, quelling in fungi, and PTGS in plants are examples of a broad family of phenomena collectively called RNA silencing (Hannon 2002; Plasterk 2002) . In addition to its occurrence in these species it has roles in viral defense (as demonstrated by Beachy) and transposon silencing mechanisms among other things. Perhaps most exciting, however, is the emerging use of PTGS and, in particular, RNAi -PTGS initiated by the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) -as a tool to knock out expression of specific genes in a variety of organisms.",

The February 1, 1991 issue of Science reported the patenting of \"molecular scissors\": the Nobel-prize winning discovery of enzymatic RNA, or \"ribozymes,\" by Thomas Czech of the University of Colorado. It was noted that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had awarded an \"unusually broad\" patent for ribozymes. The patent is U.S. Patent No. 4,987,071, claim 1 of which reads as follows: \"An enzymatic RNA molecule not naturally occurring in nature having an endonuclease activity independent of any protein, said endonuclease activity being specific for a nucleotide sequence defining a cleavage site comprising single-stranded RNA in a separate RNA molecule, and causing cleavage at said cleavage site by a transesterification reaction.\" Although enzymes made of protein are the dominant form of biocatalyst in modern cells, there are at least eight natural RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, that catalyze fundamental biological processes. One of which was yet another discovery by plant virologists, in this instance the hairpin ribozyme was discovered by George Bruening at UC Davis. The self-cleavage structure was originally called a paperclip, by the Bruening laboratory which discovered the reactions.",

Since a ribozyme is a catalytic RNA molecule capable of cleaving itself and other target RNAs it therefore can be useful as a control system for turning off genes or targeting viruses. The possibility of designing ribozymes to cleave any specific target RNA has rendered them valuable tools in both basic research and therapeutic applications. In the therapeutics area, they have been exploited to target viral RNAs in infectious diseases, dominant oncogenes in cancers and specific somatic mutations in genetic disorders. Most notably, several ribozyme gene therapy protocols for HIV patients are already in Phase 1 trials. More recently, ribozymes have been used for transgenic animal research, gene target validation and pathway elucidation. However, targeting ribozymes to the cellular compartment containing their target RNAs has proved a challenge. At the other bookend of the decade in 2000, Samarsky et al. reported that a family of small RNAs in the nucleolus (snoRNAs) can readily transport ribozymes into this subcellular organelle.",

Viroids are small, single-stranded, circular RNAs containing 246-463 nucleotides arranged in a rod-like secondary structure and are the smallest pathogenic agents yet described. The smallest viroid characterized to date is rice yellow mottle sobemovirus (RYMV), at 220 nucleotides. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection by themselves, the single-stranded circular DNA of circoviruses, is around 2 kilobases in size. The first viroid to be identified was the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). Some 33 species have been identified to date. Unlike the many satellite or defective interfering RNAs associated with plant viruses, viroids replicate autonomously on inoculation of a susceptible host. The absence of a protein capsid and of detectable messenger RNA activity implies that the information necessary for replication and pathogenesis resides within the unusual structure of the viroid genome. The replication mechanism actually involves interaction with RNA polymerase II, an enzyme normally associated with synthesis of messenger RNA, and \"rolling circle\" synthesis of new RNA. Some viroids have ribozyme activity which allow self-cleavage and ligation of unit-size genomes from larger replication intermediates. It has been proposed that viroids are \"escaped introns\".",

Pharming may also enable research on drugs that cannot currently be produced. For example, CropTech in Blacksburg, Va., is investigating a protein that seems to be a very effective anticancer agent.

It had been assumed for some time that only embryonic cells could be used as the cellular source for nuclear transfer. This assumption was shattered with the birth of Dolly. This example of cloning an animal using the nucleus of an adult cell was significant because it demonstrated the ability of egg cell cytoplasm to \"reprogram\" an adult nucleus. When cells differentiate, that is, evolve from primitive embryonic cells to functionally defined adult cells, they lose the ability to express most genes and can only express those genes necessary for the cell's differentiated function.

Primary cell cultures such as the fetal fibroblasts can only undergo about 30 population doublings before they senesce. This limited lifespan would preclude the ability to perform multiple rounds of selection. To overcome this problem of cell senescence, these researchers showed that fibroblast lifespan could be prolonged by nuclear transfer.

Although the term \"stem cell\" commonly is used to refer to the cells within the adult organism that renew tissue (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, a type of cell found in the blood), the most fundamental and extraordinary of the stem cells are found in the early-stage embryo. These embryonic stem (ES) cells, unlike the more differentiated adult stem cells or other cell types, retain the special ability to develop into nearly any cell type. Embryonic germ (EG) cells, which originate from the primordial reproductive cells of the developing fetus, have properties similar to ES cells.",

Perlegen owes its true genesis to the desire of one of its cofounders to use DNA chips to help understand the dynamics underlying genetic diseases. Brad Margus' two sons have the rare disease \"ataxia telangiectasia\" (A-T). A-T is a progressive, neurodegenerative childhood disease that affects the brain and other body systems. The first signs of the disease, which include delayed development of motor skills, poor balance, and slurred speech, usually occur during the first decade of life. Telangiectasias (tiny, red \"spider\" veins), which appear in the corners of the eyes or on the surface of the ears and cheeks, are characteristic of the disease, but are not always present.

They have created a whole genome association approach that enables them to genotype millions of unique SNPs in thousands of cases and controls in a timeframe of months rather than years. As mentioned previously, SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers are preferred over microsatellite markers for association studies because of their abundance along the human genome, the low mutation rate, and accessibilities to high-throughput genotyping. Since most diseases, and indeed responses to drug interventions, are the products of multiple genetic and environmental factors it is a challenge to develop discriminating diagnostics and, even more so, targetedtherapeutics. Because mutations involved in complex diseases act probabilisticallythat is, the clinical outcome depends on many factors in addition to variation in the sequence of a single gene -the effect of any specific mutation is smaller. Thus, such effects can only be revealed by searching for variants that differ in frequency among large numbers of patients and controls drawn from the general population.

As is to be expected from linkage disequilibrium studies, alleles making up blocks of such SNPs in close physical proximity are often correlated, resulting in reduced genetic variability and defining a limited number of \"SNP haplotypes,\" each of which reflects descent from a single, ancient ancestral chromosome. In 2001 Cox's group, using high level scanning with some old-fashioned somatic cell genetics, constructed the SNP map of Chromosome 21.The surprising findings were blocks of limited haplotype diversity in which more than 80% of a global human sample can typically be characterized by only three common haplotypes (interestingly enough the prevalence of each hapolytype in the examined population was in the ratio 50:25:12.5).From this the conclusion could be drawn that by comparing the frequency of genetic variants in unrelated cases and controls, genetic association studies could potentially identify specific haplotypes in the human genome that play important roles in disease, without need of knowledge of the history or source of the underlying sequence, which hypothesis they subsequently went on to prove.",

One of the practical implications of this observation is as suggested by Cox that only a small fraction of all the SNPs they refer to as \"tag\" SNPs can be chosen for mapping genes responsible for complex human diseases, which can significantly reduce genotyping effort, without much loss of power. They developed algorithms to partition haplotypes into blocks with the minimum number of tag SNPs for an entire chromosome. In 2005 they reported that they had developed an optimized suite of programs to analyze these block linkage disequilibrium patterns and to select the corresponding tag SNPs that will pick the minimum number of tags for the given criteria.

Cox's group have determined that fewer than 1000 total individuals provide adequate power to identify genes accounting for only a few percent of the overall genetic variability of a complex trait, even using the very stringent significance levels required when testing large numbers of DNA variants. From this it is possible to identify the set of major genetic risk factors contributing to the variability of a complex disease and/or treatment response.

In 1999, as Gilead's worldwide development and marketing partner, Roche led the final development of Tamiflu, 26 months after the first patient was dosed in clinical trials in April 1999, Roche and Gilead announced the submission of a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of influenza. Additionally, Roche filed a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in the European Union under the centralized procedure in early May 1999. Six months later in October 1999, Gilead and Roche announced that the FDA approved Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza A and B in adults. These accelerated efforts allowed Tamiflu to reach the U.S. market in time for the 1999-2000 flu season. One of Gilead's studies showed an increase in efficacy from 60% when the vaccine was used alone to 92% when the vaccine was used in conjunction with a neuraminidase inhibitor. Outside of the U.S., Tamiflu also has been approved for the treatment of influenza A and B in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Peru and Switzerland. Regulatory review of the Tamiflu MAA by European authorities is ongoing. With the H5N1 birdflu strain's relentless march (or rather flight) across Asia, in 2006 through Eastern Europe to a French farmyard, an unwelcome stowaway on a winged migration, and no vaccine in sight, Tamiflu, although untested for this species, seen as the last line of defense is now being horded and its patented production right's fought over like an alchemist's formula.",

Glaxo filed for marketing approval for Relenza in Europe and Canada.",

            "text": "The Food and Drug Administration's accelerated drug-approval timetable began to show results by 2001, its evaluation of Novartis's Gleevec took just three months compared with the standard 10-12 months. Another factor in improving biotherapeutic fortunes in the new century was the staggering profits of early successes. In 2003, $1.9 billion of the $3.3 billion in revenue collected by Genentech in South San Francisco came from oncology products, mostly the monoclonal antibody-based drugs Rituxan, used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Herceptin for breast cancer. In fact two of the first cancer drugs to use the new tools for 'rational' design Herceptin and Gleevec, a small-molecule chemotherapeutic for some forms of leukemia are proving successful, and others such as Avastin (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) for colon cancer and Erbitux are already following in their footsteps. Gleevec led the way in exploiting signal-transduction pathways to treat cancer as it blocks a mutant form of tyrosine kinase (termed the Philadelphia translocation recognized in 1960's) that can help to trigger out-of-control cell division.",

By 2002 according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 402 medicines were in development for cancer up from 215 in 1996. Another new avenue in cancer research is to combine drugs. Wyeth's Mylotarg, for instance, links an antibody to a chemotherapeutic, and homes in on CD33 receptors on acute myeloid leukemia cells. Expertise in biochemistry, cell biology and immunology is required to develop such a drug. This trend has created some bright spots in cancer research and development, even though drug discovery in general has been adversely affected by mergers, a few high-profile failures and a shaky US economy in the early 2000's.",
