            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, Order Nidovirales. There are four genera within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, namely Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) [1,2]. The CoV genome is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a size varying between 26 kb and 32 kb, the largest genome of known RNA viruses. Both \u03b1- and \u03b2-CoV genera are known to infect mammals, whilst \u03b4- and \u03b3-CoVs infect birds. Two recent outbreaks of viral pneumonia caused by \u03b2-CoVs are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2002, an outbreak of SARS was first reported in China and then spread quickly worldwide, resulting in hundreds of deaths with an 11% mortality rate [3,4]. In 2012, MERS first emerged in Saudi Arabia and subsequently spread to other countries, with a fatality rate of 37% [5], [6], [7]. In both of these epidemics, the viruses likely originated from bats and then infected humans through other intermediate animal hosts, e.g. the civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the camel for MERS-CoV [8], [9], [10].",

However, there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 or specific therapeutic drugs for this communicable disease. Thus, a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for exploring effective vaccines and drugs. In this review, we summarise recent progress in SARS-CoV-2 to provide a framework for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome (30 kb in size) encodes a large, non-structural polyprotein (ORF1a/b) that is further proteolytically cleaved to generate 15/16 proteins, 4 structural proteins and 5 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and ORF9) [14], [15], [16] (Fig. 1\n). The four structural proteins consist of the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, the membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are essential for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and infection. The spike surface glycoprotein plays a key role in its attachment to host cells and can be further cleaved by host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-bound C-terminal S2 region [17]. Binding of the S1 subunit to a host receptor can destabilise the prefusion trimer, leading to shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit into a highly stable postfusion conformation [18]. In order to engage a host receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit undergoes hinge-like conformational movements, which transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding [19,20]. These two states of the S1 subunit can be regarded as the \u2018down\u2019 conformation and the \u2018up\u2019 conformation. The former represents an inaccessible state of the receptor, whereas the latter corresponds to an accessible state [19,21]. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the spike protein can help to develop monoclonal antibody drugs and to guide the design and development of vaccines.",

The causes of different infection sites are likely related to the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lower respiratory tract, which are the major human receptors for the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [22], [23], [24]. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is \u226570% similar to that SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using the same cell entry receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV to infect humans [25,26]. However, there are more differences in the key S proteins that the viruses use to interact with host cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to human ACE2 with approximately 10\u201320-fold higher affinity than the SARS-CoV spike [19], making it easier to spread from human to human.",

Analysis of the first 99 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that cytokine storm syndromes occurred in patients with severe COVID-19; 17 patients (17%) had ARDS, among whom 11 (11%) deteriorated within a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure [30]. In addition, the numbers of total T-cells, CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells are decreased in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the surviving T-cells are functionally exhausted [31], suggesting a decreased immune function in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

Besides seafood, it is reported on social media that some wild animals including birds, snakes, marmots and bats were sold at the Huanan seafood market. It has been reported that environmental samples obtained from the marketplace have come back positive for the novel CoV, but the specific animal has not been identified [33]. More recently, several studies have suggested that bats may be the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-2 [26,34,35]. The whole genome-wide nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical to a bat CoV [26]. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from pangolins and it was found that the isolated pangolin CoV genomes have ~85.5\u201392.4% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 [36], suggesting that pangolin may be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted directly from bats or by an intermediate host requires further confirmation. Learning from the role of camels in MERS and civets in SARS, hunting for the source of SARS-CoV-2 will help determine zoonotic transmission patterns and stem the ongoing outbreak.",

There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment with continuous exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients have some gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting [40,41]. A recent study showed that the enteric symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are associated with invaded ACE2-expressing enterocytes [42], suggesting that the digestive tract is a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection besides the respiratory tract. However, additional studies are required to test this possibility.

For example, evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation were seen in the lung tissue, indicating ARDS. Moreover, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration was observed in lung tissue. Multinucleated giant cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterised by large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and amphophilic granular cytoplasm were observed in the intra-alveolar spaces, suggesting viral cytopathic-like changes [55]. These pathological characteristics of COVID-19 are highly similar to those seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [56,57].

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a molecular biological diagnosis technology based on nucleic acid sequences. The complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are available in GenBank. Thus, the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by RT-qPCR or by viral gene sequencing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, stool, sputum or blood samples [60,61]. However, collection of these specimen types by healthcare workers requires close contact with patients, which poses a risk of spreading the virus to healthcare workers. Moreover, collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens may cause bleeding, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia [32]. Importantly, To et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 could be effectively detected in the saliva specimens of infected patients [62], suggesting that saliva is a promising non-invasive specimen type for diagnosis, monitoring and infection control of COVID-19 patients.",

In addition, MSCs contribute to reducing lung fibrosis and enhancing tissue repair [95,96]. Besides routine antiviral treatment, it is important to treat cytokine storm syndromes, ARDS and acute lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19 to prevent progression of the disease and to reduce mortality. Thus, MSCs may be a promising therapeutic option.",

In addition, such passive immunisation can also be achieved by using convalescent plasma from patients with SARS-CoV infection. It has been reported that a small number of SARS-CoV-infected patients in Taiwan and Hong Kong received treatment with convalescent plasma during the early course of the disease with certain clinical benefits, including a reduction of plasma viral load from ~105 copies/mL to undetectable levels 24 h after plasma transfusion [100], [101], [102].

Previous studies have identified a number of effective monoclonal antibodies that target the SARS-CoV spike protein to prevent the virus from entering host cells [103], [104], [105]. The 193-amino acid (residues 318\u2013510) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is the key target of neutralising monoclonal antibodies [106]. The SARS-CoV neutralising monoclonal antibodies CR3014 and CR3022 were found to bind non-competitively to the SARS-CoV RBD and neutralised the virus in a synergistic manner [104]. A recent study showed that CR3022 could combine effectively with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (KD of 6.3 nM) [107]. Moreover, the epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the binding site of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD [107]. Thus, CR3022 could be a promising therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralising monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Furthermore, high doses of glycyrrhizin have been used in clinical trials and the compound was reported to be clinically effective for the treatment of SARS at that time [110,111]. Recently, glycyrrhizin was predicted to have the ability to bind ACE2 with potential anti-COVID-19 effects [112]. Hesperetin, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is a natural predominant flavonoid found in citrus fruits. Hesperetin dose-dependently suppresses the cleavage activity of the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV in cell-free and cell-based assays [113]. Hesperetin was also reported to have the potential to inhibit ACE2 and therefore block infection with SARS-CoV-2 [112]. Baicalin, another traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is a flavone isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis. It has been shown that baicalin has antiviral activity against 10 clinical isolates of SARS-CoV by neutralisation tests [114]. In addition, quercetin is a plant flavone that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and botanical medicine. Quercetin was reported to exert antiviral effects by inhibiting the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV [115] and blocking the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells [116]. Therefore, these studies suggest that Chinese medicine also plays a key role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Recently, the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly a warning. It has been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells by binding to ACE2. Besides pulmonary tissue, ACE2 is also highly expressed in other tissues including bile duct, liver, gastrointestinal organs (small intestine, duodenum), oesophagus, testis and kidney [42,[117], [118], [119]]. Thus, these organs may also be damaged by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly in multiple countries, caused severe illness and sustained human-to-human transmission, making it a concerning and serious public-health threat. Considering the global threat to health caused by SARS-CoV-2, effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia will be urgently needed. However, the development of drugs for pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 is still a major problem for humans, and there are currently no officially approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In view of the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to interrupt the spread of the virus through epidemic prevention and control methods, such as isolating infected patients and controlling the source of infection. At the same time, wild animal trafficking must be banned to reduce the spread of CoVs. In addition, it is necessary to make full use of the currently limited evidence for therapeutic drugs to develop strategies of drug application to prevent and control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It has been confirmed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shares high identity with that of bat and human SARS-CoVs. A number of antiviral drugs and treatment methods for SARS-CoV infection have also been considered for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia.",
