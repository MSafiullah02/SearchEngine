While these strategies have effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination of the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China's economic growth, resulting in the first quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize the potential shrinkage of the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two new economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to Venue (V 3 ), as the complementary measures to domestic investments and consumption activities, using the data of Baidu Maps. The historical records of these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations with the past figures of Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due to the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact of the pandemic on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V 3 . We found that the most affected sectors would be travel-dependent businesses, such as hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation, while the sectors that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas, restaurants, and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly. Analysis at the provincial level showed that the self-sufficient and self-sustainable economic regions, with internal supplies, production, and consumption, have recovered faster than those regions relying on global supply chains.",

Figure 1 illustrates three curves, representing the GDP of Mainland China, the traces of nationwide V 3 aggregated by quarters, and the traces of nationwide NVC aggregated by quarters, respectively. All the values are normalized proportionally by the maximum, accordingly (see Supplementary Materials). To figure out the strength of the associations, we apply Pearson's correlation coefficient 13 to every two groups of the data, i.e., to V 3 -vs-GDP and to NVC-vs-GDP. It shows that the Pearson's correlation between the GDP of Mainland China and the V 3 is 81.41% (N = 9 and p-value = 1.06 \u00d7 10 \u22125 0.0001); and that the Pearson's correlation between the GDP of Mainland China and the NVC is 82.11% (N = 9 and p-value = 6.63 \u00d7 10 \u22125 0.0001). We discover that the GDP has significant positive correlations with both the V 3 and the NVC, at the national level. A detailed analysis was further carried out to explore the V 3 -vs-GDP and NVC-vs-GDP correlations at the level of the provinces in Mainland China (see Supplementary Materials). The results show that both the V 3 and the NVC have significant correlations with the GDP in all 31 provinces excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan of China, supporting the main finding of this article.",

Clearly, a huge shrinkage of both indicators for the year of 2020, especially from the 3 rd week to 7 th week of 2020, can be found, through comparison with the records of 2019 and 2018. Fortunately, it also shows a clear and strong bounce of the V 3 since the 8 th week of 2020, which might suggest evidence of the recovery of on-site consumption activities. While we could roughly conclude that, from the perspectives of the V 3 , the on-site consumption activities have already been begun to return to the levels between 2018 and 2019, the domestic investment activities represented by the NVC were still low. The recent trends of the NVC were quite similar to the situations of 2018.

The recent drop of crude oil prices 15 helps to validate this observation from the consumption perspectives, such that the crude oil price turned negative for the first time in history and settled at -$37.63/bbl on April 20, 2020 16 . A recent study demonstrated that the aircraft location data can be used as real-time estimates of GDP in both the UK and the U.S. 17 , which might also validate our observation from another side. We observe similar patterns for the categories of educational institutes and hotels in Figures 3e, 3f , 3g, and 3h, respectively. This might be because these two industries might rely on the availability of public transportation, and because they also involve the aggregation of large crowds. The performance of hotels looks better than the performance of the transportation sectors, partially due to the occupation of hotels by Chinese authorities to quarantine the travelers immediately after they entered any Chinese cities. The evidence suggests a clear, but relatively weak, bounce, in terms of transportation and hospitality activities. There would be a long way to go for the full recovery in both consumption and investments.",

Compared to the trends of public transportation sectors, we could conclude that there has been a better bounce, indicative of greater recovery, in local recreation businesses. These observations suggested that there has already been a solid recovery of on-site consumption in the sectors of restaurants & beverages, recreation, and parks & scenic spots, while the recovery of investment therein would still be on its way. For the workplace category, it has been observed that the recent V 3 has been growing rapidly, and it has even surpassed the volumes in the same period of 2019, while the NVC was still lower than the performance of 2019 (but comparable to the same period of 2018). We observed the similar fall-and-rebound patterns in the recent V 3 and NVC trends of residential areas. The evidence suggests a strong recovery, and even a year-to-year growth (compared to the same period of 2019) in the consumption activities, within the categories of workplaces and residential areas, while there was no data to support the recovery of investments. Compared to the trends of the above two sectors, the recent trends within the sectors of (a) shopping & markets and (b) hospitals & pharmacies show relatively lower levels of recovery, but their V 3 reach slightly beyond the levels of the same period of 2019. In Figures 5e, 5f, 5g, and 5h, the recent trends of NVC of shopping & markets and of hospitals & pharmacies have recovered to the level of the same period in 2018, while V 3 has recovered and even earned a year-to-year growth, compared to the same period of 2019. Note that, as the venues from the V-shaped and Check-mark-shaped sectors constitute the largest proportions of all venue types, the trends of V 3 and NVC in these sectors majorly shaped the nationwide mandatory components of daily life, such as shopping, housing, and working, the bounce back toward recovery of consumption activities has been strong.
