In its normal state, the liver converts this neurotoxic product into glutamine and urea. Impaired liver function results in elevated blood ammonia. Astrocytes contain the enzyme glutamine synthetase in their endoplasmic reticulum as a means of handling excessive ammonia. Accumulation of glutamine within the astrocytes results in cell swelling which leads to a series of events that result in a neuroinhibitory state [5].False NeurotransmittersThe failing liver results in the production of false neurotransmitters. These molecules may interfere with normal brain functioning and have a net inhibitory effect [6].Amino Acid ImbalancePatients with hepatic failure have decreased plasma levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, leucine, and isoleucine while experiencing increased levels of aromatic amino acids (AAA) phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. This is thought to be related to increased muscle catabolism and therefore increased BCAA metabolism as well as decreased breakdown of AAA by the compromised liver. The end result is an imbalance that leads to an increased influx of AAA in the brain which has an inhibitory effect in the nervous system [7].GABA receptorThought to be mediated by inflammatory cells, neurosteroids are produced by myelinated glial cells. This results in positive modulation of GABA receptors that in turn enhance the inhibitory tone [8].\n",

Physical exam may show evidence of testicular atrophy in men, while ultrasound and other imaging may show atrophic ovaries and uterus. There are several possible mechanisms that explain these findings. The increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) observed in some patients suggest the primary dysfunction of the testicles or ovaries. An alternative mechanism suggests suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary function. The dysfunction may be secondary to decreased clearance of estrogen, testosterone, prolactin, and other substances [119, 120].",

The most effective medication has been propranolol that inhibits stimulation of the beta-2 venodilator receptors seen in varices. It should be started at low doses, 5 mg orally twice a day, and titrated to reduction of pulse rate by 25 %. If patients cannot take propranolol, isosorbide mononitrate can be used. If the patient is unable to tolerate medical therapy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and variceal banding should be performed [157].",

If active bleeding is encountered and it appears to involve esophageal varices, an attempt at controlling the bleeding varices should be done. Banding followed by sclerotherapy are the two most common methods of achieving control. If after appropriate attempts bleeding does not stop, a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube should be inserted. TIPS and surgical shunts should be considered if all previous methods fail. TIPS has shown improved outcomes [129]; however, it is associated with HE [157].
