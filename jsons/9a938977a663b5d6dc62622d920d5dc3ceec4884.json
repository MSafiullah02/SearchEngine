Because the precise date of the head/chest cold is unknown, the month the respondent answered in the affirmative was considered to be the month the illness occurred. We estimated the incidence proportion of head/chest cold, which measures the proportion of workers who reported having a head/chest cold during the last 2 weeks (number of incident cases divided by persons at risk). There are no other questions in the NHIS that capture information on upper respiratory infections over the previous 2 weeks. There are NHIS questions asking if the respondent during the previous 12 months had an asthma attack or physiciandiagnosed pneumonia, but this lengthy recall period precluded an examination of the seasonality of these illnesses.",

A dichotomous variable was created for education-respondents with college or higher education (16 years or more) and respondents with less than 16 years of education.

Current smokers were defined as persons who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who reported presently smoking every day or some days. Former smokers were defined as persons who had smoked 100 cigarettes or more in their lifetime, but at the time of interview reported that they were no longer smoking. Never smokers were defined as persons who never smoked or smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. For race and ethnicity, subjects were categorized into non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other.

From 1998-2004, 228,092 adults aged 18 years and over completed the sample adult core questionnaire. Among all respondents (n = 129,873) who were currently employed at the time of the survey, 5739 were teachers (which include librarians and counselors) in elementary, secondary schools and colleges representing an annual average of about 5.5 million individuals. The total sample included 1359 other service workers employed at schools, representing about 1.2 million persons. All other workers (n = 122,775) represented an annual average population estimate of 119.1 million. Among teachers, there were more female (69%), non-Hispanic White (83%), college educated (76%), and nonsmokers (91%, including former smokers [17%] and never smokers [74%]) than among all other workers (Table 1) . Other service workers employed at schools were more likely to be female, less likely to be college educated, and older than all other workers. Table 2 shows the incidence proportion and the adjusted ORs for head/chest cold among US workers. The incidence proportions across the age categories decreased significantly with age, which indicates that younger workers reported more head/chest cold compared to older workers. Non-Hispanic White workers reported the highest proportion of head/chest cold (13.9%) among the different racial/ethnic groups. Fifteen percent of teachers and 16% of other service workers at schools reported that they had head/chest cold that started in the past 2 weeks.

These figures are even higher during months of peak illness incidence (ie, November through March) compared to all other workers. During the low incidence month (ie, July), on the other hand, the incidence proportions of head/chest cold were found to be much lower among teachers and other school workers compared to all other workers.

            "text": "The large sample size of this study allowed reliable estimation of the incidence proportion of head/chest cold for teachers and other workers in school settings. Limitations in this study included the use of self-reported data to determine the occurrence of head/chest cold. The validity and reliability of this NHIS questionnaire item, ''Did you have any head cold or chest cold started in the past 2 weeks?'' have not been assessed. Misunderstanding of this question on the part of the respondent could have led to information bias. However, misclassification due to such information bias is likely nondifferential across occupation groups. Acute respiratory infection can be caused by many different viral and bacterial pathogens. 14 Laboratory testing could be useful in evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of this question, although it is not uncommon to fail to find a pathogen in those with acute respiratory tract infections. 15 Noninfectious illness may also be responsible for some head and chest colds. A recent study showed that employees from 2 elementary schools in the United States with damp and moldy environments had excess work-related throat and lower respiratory symptoms, as well as eye, nasal, sinus, and wheezing symptoms compared to the general US adult population. 8 Such respiratory symptoms in school environments have been well documented. 16, 17 One may argue that the definition of head/chest cold is nonspecific, and those with respiratory symptoms related to indoor allergens may have been misclassified as having a head/chest cold. Damp and moldy environments in some schools across the United States may have contributed to the seasonal pattern observed in our data. Detailed clinical and microbiological investigations focusing on specific communicable diseases would need to be conducted to exclude respiratory symptoms related to indoor allergens. As such, our definition for head/chest cold is unlikely to capture the entire range of infectious and noninfectious respiratory disease such as laryngitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and bronchitis. Finally, some secretaries, financial records processors, managers, and administrators employed at school may have close contact with many children in schools throughout the day. Because our analysis included these occupations in the reference group (all other workers), if those workers had a higher risk of head/chest cold than other workers in the reference group, an underestimation of the risk of head/chest cold among teachers and other school workers is possible.",

            "text": "The major reservoir of most respiratory viruses is children attending school. 18 Since school buildings typically house large populations of students in relatively small and confined areas, the potential for spread of viral respiratory infectious disease is high. However, it is impractical to completely prevent respiratory viruses from being introduced into school buildings. The seasonal pattern observed in our analysis of head/chest cold corresponds well to upper respiratory infections that are generally attributed to many different respiratory pathogens during the winter months. 14, [19] [20] [21] Increasing the rate of timely vaccinations among teachers, other school workers, and students can reduce the risk of influenza. 22 Common colds in adults are principally caused by rhinoviruses (50%) and coronaviruses (4-15%). 18 Although respiratory viruses spread from person-toperson, the relative importance of different routes of transmission varies by virus (ie, direct, fomites, large droplets, and small-particle aerosols). Consistent hand washing and avoidance of finger-nose and finger-eye contact should be recommended to reduce the risk of infections spread by hand contact with contaminated skin and fomites (eg, infections caused by rhinovirus and RSV). 23 Poorly ventilated indoor air may be an issue in the school environment, thus improving ventilation may play a role in reducing respiratory morbidity at the population level. 24, 25 In addition, since the risk of head/chest cold is highest among smokers, public health intervention efforts to reduce smoking among workers could be beneficial.",
