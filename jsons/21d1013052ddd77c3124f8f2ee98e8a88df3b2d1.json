In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to examine the association between avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents for urgent tracheal intubation and incidence of tracheostomy among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The setting of this study was an eight-bed ICU at a tertiary-care hospital in Okayama, Japan. We included patients who underwent urgent tracheal intubation at the emergency department or the ICU and were admitted to the ICU between April 2013 and November 2017. We extracted data on methods and medications of intubation, predictors for difficult intubation, Cormack-Lehane grade, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reintubation. We estimated odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for elective tracheostomy during the ICU stay using logistic regression models. Of 411 patients, 46 patients underwent intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents and 61 patients underwent tracheostomy. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients who avoided neuromuscular blocking agents had more than double the odds of tracheostomy (odds ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.06-6.34, p value = 0.04). When stratifying the subjects by risk status for tracheostomy, the association was more pronounced in high-risk group, while we observed less significant association in the low-risk group. Avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents for urgent intubation increases the risk of tracheostomy among emergency patients, especially those who have a higher risk for tracheostomy.",

A meta-analysis showed that avoiding NMBA was associated with an increased risk of both a difficult tracheal intubation and an upper airway injury [2] . Because these complications could lead to subsequent negative outcomes, such as reintubation or tracheostomy, it is important to examine the effects of avoiding NMBA for urgent tracheal intubation. This is especially true in emergency departments (EDs) in Japan, where using NMBA for emergency airway management is not very common [3] (although we do use NMBA in our Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s1173 9-019-02214 -0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. 1 3 ED) . Despite the potential benefit of this modifiable intervention, however, it remains unclear whether the avoidance of NMBA is associated with subsequent negative in-hospital outcomes.",

We excluded those patients who required only palliative care, were younger than 18 years of age, and/or in whom tracheostomy was unavoidable because of their primary disease or a failed intubation. We also excluded patients who underwent intubation in the operating room, because such patients were electively intubated. In general, patients are either critical and die shortly after admission or leave the ICU quickly without a critical situation. Because such patients are unlikely to undergo elective tracheostomy during their ICU stay, we excluded patients whose length of ICU stay was less than 2 days and/ or whose overall length of hospital stay was less than 7 days. Further, because we often transfer patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) center and are unable to collect the data of primary outcome, we excluded these patients as well. The diagnosis and classification of ARDS were made according to the Berlin definition [4] .",

The number of intubation attempts was defined as the number of insertions of the laryngoscope past the teeth.

These findings suggest that airway injuries were more likely to develop due to certain mechanisms among the patients with a higher risk for tracheostomy. We a posteriori hypothesized that the variables associated with difficult intubation (i.e., Cormack-Lehan grade, the number of predictors for difficult intubation) resulted in an increased risk of airway injury among these patients. However, the distributions of these variables were similar between the high-risk group and the low-risk group, and the number of airway injuries was quite small (Online Resource 2). We should note that it is possible that this information was inaccurate because the injuries were self-reported. Furthermore, the data we collected may be insufficient for evaluating the extent of soft tissue damage during urgent intubation. For example, information about the amount of time required for intubation and how gently intubation was performed is necessary. In addition, minor soft tissue damage is often unrecognized and unreported at the time of intubation, which presents as vocal cord paralysis or laryngeal edema only after extubation, and unreported airway injuries would also more likely lead to the need for tracheostomy. Further studies are needed to validate the potential effect modification observed in this study.",
