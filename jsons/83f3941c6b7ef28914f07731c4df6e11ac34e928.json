A review of ophthalmologic guidelines on COVID-19 suggests that the decision to provide intervention during the pandemic should be based on clinical judgment. Furthermore, patients with non-urgent clinical conditions (such as stable glaucoma and amblyopia) and non-urgent surgical conditions (such as cataract or epiretinal membrane) can be scheduled later. 5 For those requiring urgent clinical assessment or procedures, stringent isolation and protection measures .

Since their introduction to New Zealand there has been a significant reduction to the nAMD-associated blindness. The expected cost per quality adjusted life-year for sight improvement/maintenance from this treatment is estimated at NZ$2,900. In the New Zealand health setting, most nAMD treatments are delivered by our public health service, with less than 10% of volume performed in private. 7 COVID-19 imposes a high burden of morbidity and mortality upon communities through illness and death. However, severe vision impairment and blindness due to untreated eye conditions such as AMD also imposes quality of life losses. The clinical judgment equation must determine whether to treat or defer after balancing these competing impacts on health. The difference in disease burden expressed as annualised disability weight (DW) for a shift from moderate distance vision impairment to severe distance vision impairment is 0.153, whereas the DW for a 'moderate infectious disease' is 0.051, which only applies for the duration of illness. 8 COVID-19 can be a severe and deadly disease, nevertheless the burden of vision loss is significant and ongoing.",

We also evaluated scenarios assuming the transmission probability reported for 'close contacts' was reduced by 95% due to the impact of full PPE used by all staff (gloves, goggles, face shields, water resistant gowns, and respiratory protective equipment). Finally, we analysed scenarios where we assumed either the patient or one health care worker is currently infected with COVID-19.

We estimated the expected HALYs lost due to COVID-19 transmission in the clinical setting, and the expected HALY gains from preventing progression of eye disease from moderate impairment to severe impairment. Our results indicate that for the most plausible community prevalence rates of COVID-19 and with availability of appropriate PPE, then ophthalmic procedures should continue in many cases even when there is a probability of progression to severe visual impairment of 1% or less. The reason for this result is easily illustrated by considering that the HALYs lost when someone suffers severe visual impairment for 5 years are equivalent to nearly 400 moderate cases of infectious disease lasting 2 weeks each. 8 In an epidemic, the pendulum has to swing from the greater good of the individual patient toward the greater good of all persons. There will be myriad of factors to consider when deciding on whether to continue or suspend anti-VEGF injections (patient and carer factors, governmental health policies, clinician decision making especially whether patient has good vision in one or two eyes, among others) but this modelling provides some evidence to estimate the quantity of HALYs at stake and the risks involved in anti-VEGF intravitreal injections.
