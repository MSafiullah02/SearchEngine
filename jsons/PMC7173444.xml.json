During the embryonic period, in the first few weeks after conception, lung buds form as a projection of the endodermal tissue into the mesenchyme. The pseudoglandular period extends to the 17th week of life, during which rapid lung growth is accompanied by formation of the bronchi and branching of the airways down to the terminal bronchioli. Further development of bronchioli and vascularization of the airways occurs during the canalicular stage of the second trimester. The saccular stage begins at approximately 24 weeks, when terminal air sacs begin to form. The capillary networks surrounding these air spaces proliferate, allowing sufficient pulmonary gas exchange for extrauterine survival of the premature neonate by 26 to 28 weeks. Formation of alveoli occurs by lengthening of the saccules and thinning of the saccular walls and has begun by the 36th week after conception in most human fetuses. The vast majority of alveolar formation occurs after birth, typically continuing until 8 to 10 years postnatally. At birth, the neonatal lung usually contains 10 to 20 million terminal air sacs (many of which are saccules rather than alveoli), one-tenth the number in the mature adult lung. After birth, growth of the lungs occurs primarily as an increase in the number of respiratory bronchioles and alveoli rather than an increase in the size of the alveoli.",

The development of a respiratory rhythm, detectable initially by intermittent rhythmic fetal thoracic movements, begins well before birth and may be necessary for normal anatomic and physiologic lung development. Interruption of umbilical blood flow at birth initiates continuous rhythmic breathing. Amniotic fluid is expelled from the lungs via the upper airways with the first few breaths, with residual fluid draining through the lymphatic and pulmonary channels in the first days of life. Changes in the partial pressures of oxygen (Po\n2) and carbon dioxide (Pco\n2) and in hydrogen ion concentration (pH) cause an acute decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and a consequent increase in pulmonary blood flow. Increased left atrial and decreased right atrial pressures reverse the pressure gradient across the foramen ovale, causing functional closure of this left-to-right one-way flap valve. Ventilatory rhythm is augmented and maintained in part by the increased arterial oxygen relative to the prior intrauterine levels.",

The airway receptors are subdivided into the slowly adapting receptors, also called pulmonary stretch receptors, and the rapidly adapting receptors. The stretch receptors, found in the airway smooth muscle, are thought to be involved in the balance of inspiration and expiration. These receptors may be the sensors in the Hering-Breuer reflexes, which prevent overdistention or collapse of the lung. The rapidly adapting receptors lie between the airway epithelial cells and are triggered by noxious stimuli such as smoke, dust, and histamine. Parenchymal receptors, also known as juxtacapillary receptors, are located adjacent to the alveolar blood vessels; they respond to hyperinflation of the lungs, to various chemical stimuli in the pulmonary circulation, and possibly to interstitial congestion. Chest wall receptors include mechanoreceptors and joint proprioreceptors.

Involuntary integration of sensory input occurs in various respiratory nuclei and neural complexes in the pons and medulla that modify the baseline pacemaker firing of the respiratory rhythm generators. The cerebral cortex also affects breathing rhythm and influences or overrides involuntary rhythm generation in response to conscious or subconscious activity, such as emotion, arousal, pain, speech, breath-holding, and other activities.2\n",

The diaphragm produces the majority of tidal volume during quiet inspiration, with the intercostal, abdominal, and accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid and neck muscles) providing additional negative pressure. The elastic recoil of the lungs and thorax produces expiration. Inspiration is an active and expiration a passive action in normal lungs during quiet breathing.

Particularly with young children, your best opportunity to observe them before they react to your presence is from across the room, and inspection from a distance can provide useful information. The respiratory rate is a sensitive marker of pulmonary problems, and scrutiny of the rate before a young child becomes agitated and hyperventilates is an important metric. Pulse oximetry is a useful baseline indicator of oxygenation. Nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and the marked use of accessory respiratory muscles are all signs of respiratory distress. General appearance is also important. Apathy, anxiety, agitation, or persistent adoption of a fixed posture may indicate profound respiratory or airway difficulties, and intense cyanosis can also be detected from a distance. Weight may relate to pulmonary function; children with chronic severe pulmonary disease are often underweight owing to retarded growth or malnourishment, whereas severe obesity can produce airway obstruction and sleep apnea.

Asthma is the most common obstructive pulmonary disease in children. Rare causes of obstruction include airway lesions, congenital subglottic webs, and vocal cord dysfunction. Restrictive lung disease can arise from limitations to chest wall movement, such as chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or pleural effusions, or from space-occupying intrathoracic pathology such as large bullae or congenital cysts. Alveolar filling defects (e.g., lobar pneumonia) also reduce lung volume and can be considered as restrictive processes. Although the diseases arise from specific isolated genetic disorders, children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and sickle cell disease (SCD) can have highly variable pulmonary pathologic processes with both obstructive and restrictive components of lung disease. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may also result in both obstructive and restrictive pathology.",

This information can be gleaned from distinctive changes in the configuration of the flow\u2013volume loop, a graphic representation of inspiratory and expiratory flow volumes plotted against time. A fixed central airway obstruction, such as a tumor or stenosis, may obstruct both inspiration and expiration, flattening the flow\u2013volume curve on both inspiration and expiration (see Video 14.1\nImage 1). The child with tracheal stenosis, for example, has flattening of both inhalation and exhalation curves (see Fig. 13.6). A variable obstruction tends to affect only one part of the ventilatory cycle. On inhalation, the chest expands and draws the airways open. On exhalation, as the chest collapses, the intrathoracic airways collapse. Variable extrathoracic lesions tend to obstruct on inhalation more than exhalation, whereas variable intrathoracic lesions tend to obstruct more on exhalation. This produces the characteristic flow\u2013volume patterns.",

Alternative treatments at this step include a leukotriene receptor antagonist, a mast cell stabilizer such as cromolyn sodium or nedocromil, and a methylxanthine bronchodilator such as theophylline. The third step in therapy involves increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid or adding an alternative treatment to a smaller dose of corticosteroid; a long-acting \u03b2-agonist, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, or theophylline may be considered. Step 4 involves a medium dose of corticosteroid together with a long-acting \u03b2-agonist.

Nevertheless, avoidance of tracheal and vocal cord stimulation by use of a face mask or an LMA instead of an ETT whenever possible seems a sensible approach. If tracheal intubation is mandatory, a deep plane of anesthesia is preferred to blunt airway hyperreactivity. Similarly, unless contraindicated by other factors, deep extubation is preferred for the same reason. Surgical stimulation is another trigger of bronchospasm, and anesthetic depth and analgesia should be adequate to prevent this response.",

In a small study of children undergoing injection of esophageal varices, pulmonary function test results deteriorated 48 hours after general anesthesia.91 In contrast, in almost 100 children in two studies, no difference in pulmonary function tests measured before compared with after a variety of surgical procedures was observed.82, 92 Although acute pulmonary morbidity may pose challenges, the effects of the anesthetic management techniques on pulmonary function tests are difficult to predict.",
