Regarding that CD13 is expressed in lipid rafts of monocytic cells, we have investigated whether Ezetimib influences raft function in these cells. Expression of raft-associated antigens (CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD16, CD36, and CD64) was followed by flow cytometry and/or immunoblot in human monocyte-derived macrophages in response to in vitro administration of Ezetimib. Cellular redistribution of CD13 was assessed by confocal imaging. Ezetimib significantly decreased the surface expression of CD13, CD16, CD64, and CD36; furthermore, it induced a shift of CD13 from plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles, and thus it quite likely modulated monocytic raftassembly. q",

In a recent study, Mina-Osorio and Ortega provide evidence that CD13 functionally interacts with the Fcg receptor I (CD64) on monocytic cells (3) . As characterized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), human monocytes contain a CD14, CD32, CD64, CD47, and CD55-containing, raft-associated, constitutive receptor cluster (5) .

The binding site for Ezetimib on CD13 differs from the aminopeptidase activity of this antigen (4). Since CD13 is constitutively expressed in lipid rafts of monocytes/macrophages, it is tempting to speculate that Ezetimib influences structure and/or function of rafts in these cells. Indeed, the present study provides evidence that Ezetimib modulates the cellular redistribution and expression of CD13 in monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, the expression of further raftassociated antigens such as the Fcg receptors CD16 and CD64, and the scavenger receptor CD36, extensively implicated in cellular uptake of modified lipoproteins or phagocytosis, is also down-regulated in response to Ezetimib. The decreased expression of these receptors upon Ezetimib administration may lead to an impaired macrophage-differentiation and lipid-uptake, and thus Ezetimib quite likely exerts an in vitro antiatherogenic effect in monocyte-derived macrophages, which involves rafts.",

Ezetimib may exert its cellular effect through disruption of the coassembly of CD13 with CD64/CD16 or CD36, and in this scenario, the missing coassociation of receptors may lead to their disappearance from rafts. The finding that CD13 disappears from DRMs/rafts in response to Ezetimib (Fig. 1C ) may support this hypothesis. Binding of Ezetimib to CD13 quite likely induces a conformational change in the extracellular domain of CD13, masking the specific sequence required for coassociation of CD13 with other receptors. Such a mechanism has recently been proposed for Ezetimib in enterocytes (4) . Alternatively, shedding of CD13 in response to Ezetimib may also explain the loss of its expression.",

Relative mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of control cells (treated with DMSO as solvent of Ezetimib, open bars) and Ezetimib-treated cells (solid bars) were compared for each antigen (CD13, CD16, CD64, CD36, CD14, and CD11b, as indicated). MFI of control cells was taken as 1 unit, and the effect of Ezetimib was expressed as compared to control. Data are presented as mean 6 S.D., P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant (*) by using a paired t-test for n 5 3 repeats. (B) Cellular redistribution of CD13 (FITC, green) and annexin II (Texas Red, red) in control (left) and Ezetimib-treated (right) human monocytederived macrophages. Merged, representative confocal images are presented, showing an extensive shift of both proteins, from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic vesicles, in response to 10 lM Ezetimib. Quantification of co-localization (yellow) in the plasma membrane (arrows) was 96% in control (treated with DMSO as solvent of Ezetimib) and 11% in Ezetimib-treated cells, respectively. Scale bars: 10 lm. (C) Shift of CD13 from detergent resistant (i.e. raft) to detergent soluble (i.e. non-raft) fractions in response to Ezetimib. Sucrose density gradient fractions of Lubrol WX-lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on each lane. 1-3: detergent resistant membrane (DRM, i.e. raft) fractions, 4-7: detergent soluble (i.e. non-raft) cellular fractions. In control cell (treated with DMSO as solvent of Ezetimib) lysates CD13 is clearly detectable in DRM and detergent soluble fractions. By contrast, in Ezetimib-treated cell lysates CD13 is present only in detergent soluble fractions. (D) Decrease of the total cellular content of CD13 in monocyte-derived macrophages in response to ezetimib. Immunoblot of whole cell lysates from control (left) and Ezetimib-treated (right) cells. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on both lanes.",
