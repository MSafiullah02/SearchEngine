Except for Influenza virus and Respiratory Syncytial virus, mostly viral aetiology of AVRI remains undiagnosed. Lately, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have emerged as an important aetiology of AVRI. A laboratory based retrospective cross sectional study was conducted in which respiratory samples (throat swabs) of patients (n \u00bc 864), with Influenza negative SARI, of all age groups between Jan 2011-Dec 2012 were tested for HCoVs including MERS-CoV using Conventional and real time PCR assays. The prevalence of HCoV among SARI cases was 1.04% (9/864) [95% CI: 0.36-1.72]. Of these four (44.44%) were identified as HCoV OC43, three (33.33%) as HCoV NL63 and two (22.22%) as HCoV 229E. No HCoV HKU1 was detected. The samples were also negative for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The results of this study documents low prevalence of human coronaviruses in SARI cases in south western India and the absence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. As the study included only SARI cases the prevalence reported could be an under estimate when it is extrapolated to community.",

The low prevalence of HCoVs found in the study could be possibly due to inclusion of SARI cases alone. This may be an underestimate of actual community prevalence of HCoVs in AVRI cases in community. A well designed cross sectional study in community is required to establish the distribution of HCoVs in the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, our findings form a strong base for future research on the epidemiology and disease burden of HCoVs in India. ",
