The sequence, structure, and function of several vertebrates have been investigated during the past 50 years. More than 200 hundreds of hemoglobin protein sequences have been deposited into the Swiss-Prot database. Three-dimensional structure wild type and mutants from dozens of species have been solved. This provides us a good opportunity to study the relationship among sequence, structure, and function of hemoglobins. Bar-headed goose is a special species of migration birds. They live in the Qinghai Lake during summer time and fly to India all the way along over the Tibetan plateau in autumn and come back in spring. Interestingly, a close relative of bar-headed goose, the graylag goose, lives in the low land of India all year round and do not migrate. Sequence alignment of bar-headed goose hemoglobin with that of graylag goose shows that there are only 4 substitutions. The Pro 119 in the alpha subunit of graylag goose has been changed to Ala in bar-headed goose. This residue is located in the surface of the alpha/beta interface. In 1983, Perutz proposed that this substitution reduces the contact between the alpha and beta subunits and increases the oxygen affinity, due to the relation of the tension status in the deoxy form [1] .",
