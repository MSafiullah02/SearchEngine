Methods and Results: Intranasal inoculation of nonadapted H1N1 virus into C57BL, BALB/c and CD-1 mice caused infection in all three species. Respiratory exposure of CD-1 mice to the aerosolized virus at graduated doses was accomplished in a modified rodent exposure apparatus. Weight change was recorded for 7 days postexposure, and viral populations in lung tissue homogenates were measured post mortem by DNA amplification (qRT-PCR), direct fluorescence and microscopic evaluation of cytopathic effect. Plots of weight change and of PCR cycle threshold vs delivered dose were linear to threshold doses of~40 TCID 50 and~12 TCID 50 , respectively. Conclusions: MID 50 for inspired H1N1 aerosols in CD-1 mice is between 12 and 40 TCID 50 ; proportionality to dose of weight loss and viral populations makes the CD-1 mouse a useful model for measuring infectivity by inhalation. Significance and Impact of the Study: In the CATS, this mouse-virus model provides the first quantitative method to evaluate the ability of respiratory protective technologies to attenuate the infectivity of an inspired pathogenic aerosol.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Journal of Applied Microbiology", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Whereas aerosols and contact are accepted as modes of transmitting many disease-causing organisms, including Legionella pneumophila, smallpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronaviruses, rhinovirus (Fiegel et al. 2006 ) and tuberculosis (Wells 1934; Riley et al. 1959; McClement and Christianson 1980) , the role of bioaerosols as a transmission mechanism for influenza is less clearly understood (Tellier 2006; Tellier 2007a,b; Lemieux and Brankston, 2007; Brankston et al. 2007; Tang and Li, 2007; Lee 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 230, "text": "(Fiegel et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 250, "end": 262, "text": "(Wells 1934;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 263, "end": 281, "text": "Riley et al. 1959;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 282, "end": 314, "text": "McClement and Christianson 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 410, "end": 424, "text": "(Tellier 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 425, "end": 441, "text": "Tellier 2007a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 442, "end": 470, "text": "Lemieux and Brankston, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 471, "end": 493, "text": "Brankston et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 494, "end": 512, "text": "Tang and Li, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 513, "end": 522, "text": "Lee 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bioaerosols and transmission of respiratory diseases"}, {"text": "Although a few publications have documented the transmissibility of influenza A through inhalation routes (Tellier 2006 (Tellier , 2009 , few studies to date have utilized a mouse model to investigate susceptibility to and pathogenicity of measured aerosol exposures.
