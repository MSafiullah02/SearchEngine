However, less data are available on the role of HBoV in gastroenteritis. The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence of HBoV in children with gastroenteritis. Methods: Real-time PCR TaqMan was used to screen 200 stool specimens that had been referred to the virology laboratory for HBoV evaluation. All of samples were collected on viral transport media. Results: Of the 200 stool samples analyzed, 16 (8%) were positive for HBoV. Human Bocavirus positive samples from patients aged between 1 to 5 years with acute gastroenteritis infection suggest a minor role of HBoV in gastroenteritis (p=0.0001).",

This study demonstrated the presence of HBoV genomic DNA in stool samples from a group of children with acute gastroenteritis. The study is in line with previous studies in China, Australia, USA, and Brazil (14,15). The frequency of HBoV in the present study (8%) was higher than the frequency reported in the previous studies (Canada 1.5%, Sweden 3.1%, Australia 5.6%, and Japan 5.7%, Germany 10.3% and Korea 11.3%) (23) . An increasing evidence suggests a relationship between HBoV and the disease. High titers of DNA in some samples suggest that the virus replicates in the human gut and none of the HBoV-positive patients showed the respiratory symptoms. The low HBoV-DNA titers in other stool samples could be explained by swallowed virus from the respiratory tract; but HBoV cannot be ruled out as a cause for single gastroenteritis cases. Control groups were used to support evidence demonstrating an association between HBoV infection and gastroenteritis (16, 17) . HBoV is an important agent for outbreaks of gastroenteritis in day care facilities for children (18, 19) .",

To improve the diagnostic methods for HBoV detection, a realtime PCR assay was applied in this study. This assay was sensitive, specific, and reliable for HBoV DNA amplification. Obviously, this real-time PCR is simple and less time consuming. It is truly a cost-effective laboratory method to detect different viruses (24, 25) . The designed primers used in this novel real-time PCR were designed based on virus sequences circulating recently and are appropriate for screening Bocavirus in clinical specimens from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis to detect recent strains circulating in patients (26) . http://mjiri.tums.ac.ir",
