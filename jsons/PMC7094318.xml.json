This possibility is more problematic because airborne infectious particles can remain suspended in the air for long periods, the infection can be transmitted to larger numbers of people including those not in close contact with the index case, and protective measures include wearing a respirator and patient placement in negative air pressure rooms that may not be available at all medical centers.
