Subsequently, this factor was identified as belonging to a group of proteins; currently, 3 types of IFNs are known as types I, II, and III with distinct structures, biological properties, and activities (2 ) . Type I IFNs contain 2 major subtypes: the fibroblast or IFN-\u2424 and the leukocyte or IFN-\u2423. They are commonly produced by all nucleated cells exposed to a viral infection (3, 4 ) . Although the type III IFNs (IFN-) are also produced by nucleated cells in response to an infectious virus (3, 4 ) , they are primarily active on epithelial cells (5 ) because unlike the type I IFN receptors that are broadly produced on most cell types, type III IFN receptors are largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin (3 ) .",

On the basis of the sequences, it was predicted that huIFN-\u2423 and huIFN-\u2424 would contain 60%-70% \u2423-helices. With the stereochemical method of packing the \u2423-helices into globular proteins, 5 segments of \u2423-helices, capable of forming tightly packed hydrophobic cores, were localized (18 ) . Thus, the predicted globular structure of huIFN-\u2423 and huIFN-\u2424 was a 5-helix (named the A-E) bundle (19 ) . Although the overall identity between the sequences of huIFN-\u2423 and huIFN-\u2424 was only 29%, the sequences of the AB loop were 46% identitical. Most of the conserved amino acid residues in the AB loop were hydrophilic and, therefore, exposed to the surface. There was also 70% identity in the region of \u2423-helix E, and therefore it was suggested that the AB loop and the \u2423-helix E together could form the active site (18 ) . Later, the sequences of 28 IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 genes of different species were compared (19 ) . Twenty-one conservative positions were identified in which there was no amino acid substitution or only 1 homologous replacement. A cluster of 7 conservative positions was found in the AB loop. Five of the 7 conservative positions composing this cluster, were hydrophilic and, therefore, very likely to reside on the surface of the molecule. The second cluster of 6 conservative positions was found in the \u2423-helix E and in the DE loop (19 ) . With the same predictive approach as for the huIFN-\u2423 and huIFN-\u2424 (18 ), it was found that many cytokines (IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7; macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor, and chicken myelomonocytic growth factor) were related to \u2423-helical proteins and contained 54% to 73% of \u2423-helices (20 ) . Helical segments (in main 5 segments) capable of forming tightly packed hydrophobic cores were localized (20 ) .",

They exhibit approximately 20%-60% sequence identity, and despite their differential activities, all type I IFNs initiate intracellular signaling by binding to a common receptor composed of 2 subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (22 ) . The IFNAR1 subunit has low affinity to huIFN-\u24232. Therefore, to get a high affinity for IFNAR1, a triple mutant (H57Y, G58N, Q61S) of huIFN-\u24232 was designed. It was designated as huIFN-\u24232 (YNS). The stable crystal structures of type I IFN ternary signaling complexes containing both receptor chains IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 in complex with huIFN-\u24232 (YNS) were solved (23 ) . The crystallographic analysis confirmed the structure of huIFN-\u2423 to be a 5-helix bundle (23, 24 ) . The major \u2423-helices, composing a bundle with 5 \u2423-helices, are labeled A-E, as shown in Fig. 1 .

A highaffinity binding site for IFNAR2 in the huIFN-\u24232 molecule is mostly composed of the AB loop and the \u2423-helix E (Fig. 1 , A and C). Arg33 in the huIFN-\u24232 (YNS), corresponding to Arg35 in the huIFN-, is the most important residue for the binding of huIFN-\u24232 or huIFN-to IFNAR2 (23 ) . The ligand forms a network of hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ile45 and Glu50 of IFNAR2 and the side chain of Thr44 of IFNAR2. Replacing Arg33 by Ala in the huIFN-\u24232 (YNS) destabilizes the binding more than any other mutation in the huIFN-\u24232 (23 ) . Previous attention was drawn to Leu30 in the huIFN-\u24232 (the equivalent of Leu32 in the huIFN-), which is conserved in all type I IFNs (19, 21 ) . In a crystal structure of the ternary complex, both amino acids bind to similar hydrophobic clusters in IFNAR2 (23 ) . Therefore, it was suggested that these residues are energetically critical for the shared anchor points mediating the IFN cross-reactivity. The \u2423-helix E comprises Val142, Met148, Arg149, Ser152, Leu153, and Asn156, with side chains participating in binding of IFNAR2 (23 ) . The binding site for IFNAR1 in the IFN-\u24232 molecule is formed by the \u2423-helices B, C, and D (Fig. 1, A and B) .",

The activated JAKs phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 that induces their heterodimerization (STAT1-STAT2) (2, 3 ) . The dimer recruits the interferon response factor 9 to form a trimeric transcription factor complex named as the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) that migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the interferon-stimulated response element, thus promoting the transcription of the ISGs, including mx1 and mx2. The repertoire of genes induced by type III IFNs is essentially the same as the 1 induced by type I IFNs (37, 38 ) , and as a consequence, type I and III IFNs display many of the same biological activities-including the antiviral activity-in a wide variety of target cells (2 ) . Expression of the type III IFN genes and their corresponding proteins are inducible by infection with many types of viruses, and this process also applies to the genes induced by the type I IFNs. However, unlike the type I IFN receptors that are produced on most cell types, type III IFN receptors are mostly restricted to cells of epithelial origin (2 ).",

The The figure is redrawn on the basis of the amino acid sequence, secondary structure, and coordinates of atoms taken from the PDB under accession code 3OG6 (huIFN-1-IFNLR1 binary complex). globular G domain comprises a central core consisting of 6 \u2424-strands surrounded by \u2423-helical segments. It is linked to a stalk that is composed of 4 long \u2423-helices. The G domain binds and hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is located at the opposite site of the extended stalk in the MxA monomer (Fig. 5A) . The connection between the G domain and the stalk is formed by the BSE. It is composed of 3 \u2423-helices derived from the flanking regions of the G domain and the very C-terminal part of the molecule that folds back to the N-terminal G domain (Fig. 5A) . The BSE is thought to function as a mediator of conformational coupling between the G domain and the stalk; it transmits a signal from the stalk to the G domain and vice versa transfers structural changes induced by GTP binding and hydrolysis to the stalk (41 ) . The MxA molecule is flexible owing to the 2 hinge-like regions. Real-time domain dynamics of MxA were studied by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (42 ) .

In addition, it has been found that MxAtransfected cells were protected against Semliki Forest virus, a togavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, whereas they were not protected against the multiplication of other positive-stranded RNA virus, mengovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family (46 ) .

In addition, production of the VP1 CVB protein analyzed by immunofluorescence was highly restricted in comparison with control cells. Moreover, the accumulation of negative-and positive-strand CVB4 RNA was prevented, as shown by in situ hybridization and reverse transcription PCR.

Recently some well-studied DNA viruses representing the Poxviridae family were tested for their sensitivity to MxA (48 ) . A cell line induced to produce inhibitory concentrations of MxA showed no antivaccinia virus activity, indicating either a lack of susceptibility of the virus or the existence of viral factors capable of counteracting the MxA inhibition. To determine if the VACV resistance to MxA was due to a virus-encoded anti-MxA activity, VACV and the MxA-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus were coinfected (48 ) . It was shown that VACV does not protect the vesicular stomatitis virus from the MxA inhibition at the protein level. Those results were extended to several additional VACV strains and 2 CPXV strains, thus confirming that these orthopoxviruses do not block the MxA action. Overall, these results point to a lack of susceptibility of the Poxviridae to MxA antiviral activity. Recently, naturally occurring allelic variations of mx1 coding for the influenza restriction factor MxA were investigated (49 ) . It was found that nonsynonymous variations in the GTPase domain cause a loss of both antiviral and enzymatic activities (49 ) . Additionally, it was demonstrated that these amino acid substitutions disrupt the interface for the GTPase domain dimerization required for the stimulation of the GTP hydrolysis (49 ) . The results obtained convincingly show that the naturally occurring mutations in the human mx1 gene can influence MxA function, which may also explain the individual variations in influenza virus susceptibility in the human population.",

In this model, Mx forms tetramers that at higher Mx concentrations can further oligomerize into large Mx rings (Fig. 5B) (43 ) . GTPase domains are situated on the outside of the ring, and stalks are directed inwards. Furthermore, the Mx rings can interact through their GTPase domains, increasing the GTPase activity. The C-termini of the Mx proteins are important for binding of the viral targets. Such a mode of assembly and oligomerization possibly leads to multiple Mx rings wrapping around the viral target structures (15 ) . The arrangement of repetitive nucleoprotein or capsid protein molecules potentiates multiple bonds with the Mx oligomers. Therefore, even a low-affinity interaction could result in a high-avidity binding. Mx rings could prevent the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes with the viral polymerase, thereby suppressing virus transcription or replication (Fig. 6) (15 ) . The Mx rings could also translocate viral nucleoproteins or capsid proteins to perinuclear complexes in a GTPase-dependent manner, leading to their degradation. However, the detailed mo-lecular mechanisms by which Mx GTPases inhibit the susceptible viruses need further elucidation (39 ) .",

Approximately 80% of all antibiotics are prescribed in primary care, and up to 80% of these are for respiratory tract infections (53 ) . If an infection has a viral cause, antibiotics are useless and unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients (53, 54 ) . At the same time, the inappropriate therapy of using antibiotics for viral infections increases the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. In May 2015, the 68th World Health Assembly endorsed a global action plan to tackle antibiotic resistance. One of the 5 main actions of the plan was to optimize the use of antibiotic medicines in human and animal health (55 ). The Assembly declared that \"Decisions to prescribe antibiotics are rarely based on definitive diagnoses. Effective, rapid, lowcost diagnostic tools are needed for guiding optimal use of antibiotics in human and animal medicine, and such tools should be easily integrated into clinical, pharmacy and veterinary practices. Evidence-based prescribing and dispensing should be the standard of care.\"",

A microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, PCR, and serology. Blood MxA concentration was determined. A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: group A Streptococcus (GAS) alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses. Blood MxA concentrations were higher in children with viral [median (IQR): 880 (245-1250) g/L] or concomitant GAS-viral [340 (150 -710) g/L] than in those with sole GAS [105 (80 -160) g/L] infections. Thus, detection of respiratory viruses simultaneously with increased blood MxA concentrations supports the causative role of viruses in most children with pharyngitis.",

A prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study of adults and children with febrile upper respiratory tract infections was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the test to identify clinically significant bacterial infection with host response and acute pathogenic viral infection. Among 205 patients, 25 (12.2%) were classified as bacterial, 53 (25.9%) as viral, and 127 (62.0%) as negative by the reference standard. For bacterial detection, agreement between FebriDx and the reference standard was 91.7%, with FebriDx having a clinical sensitiv-ity of 80% (95% CI, 59%-93%), clinical specificity of 93% (95% CI, 89%-97%), positive predictive value of 63% (95% CI, 45-79%), and a negative predictive value of 97% (95% CI, 94 -99%). For viral detection, agreement was 84%, with a clinical sensitivity of 87% (95% CI, 75%-95%), clinical specificity of 83% (95% CI, 76%-89%), positive predictive value of 64% (95% CI, 63%-75%), and a negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI, 90%-98%). mRNA indexes of MxA and 2 other interferon responsive genes (viperin and tripartite motif-containing protein 21) were investigated in nasal swabs as potential biomarkers of viral respiratory infection in children (75 ) . Additionally, respiratory viruses in the same swabs were detected by PCR. Nasal MxA and viperin indexes were increased in symptomatic virus-positive children. The nasal viperin index was found to be a robust marker of viral respiratory tract infection with a clinical sensitivity of 80% and clinical specificity of 94% in distinguishing children with symptomatic virus infections from the asymptomatic virus-negative children.",

Biomarkers such as CRP or procalcitonin independently may identify clinically significant infections, thereby reducing the risk of missing a clinically significant bacterial infection. However, these biomarkers lack adequate clinical specificity to differentiate a viral from a bacterial infection and ultimately lead to antibiotic overtreatment of viral infections. Moreover, the performance characteristics of CRP as a marker for bacterial infections vary considerable among published studies and are heavily influenced by the organ system involved and numerous comorbidities. Therefore, procalcitonin, which is gaining favor as a more specific biomarker of bacterial infection, should also be included in the diagnostics (76 ) .",

Rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus infections were also characterized by increased MxA concentrations. Asymptomatic virus-negative children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine had increased MxA protein concentrations of 240 (120 -540) g/L but had significantly lower concentrations than children with an acute respiratory infection who had not received vaccinations: 740 (350 -1425) g/L; P \u03fd 0.001.
