In professional football, for example, there are-on average-four bleeding injuries per game. However, researchers consider that the estimated risk of HIV transmission seems to be less than one in one million. In the case of hepatitis B transmission during exercise, the theoretical risk is also extremely low-a bit above the risk of HIV transmission. There are seven known hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), of which hepatitis A and E are usually passed from person to person, whereas hepatitis B, C, and G viruses are transmitted by blood. Wrestlers and boxers are in close body contact, then they are more prone to infections than soccer and basketball players or judo athletes, whose risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission is moderate. These pathogens could be transmitted by the use of common contaminated items or bleeding wounds during sports. Health care professionals should pay careful attention to the risk of horizontal transmission of hepatitis B in contact sports. It is the responsibility of athletes to inform physicians, trainers, and other staff about any health condition as well as possible injuries or lesions before competition. If there is bleeding during competition, the athlete should be removed from play immediately, bleeding should be controlled, the wound should be washed with soap and water, or an antiseptic solution, and the area should be covered with occlusive dressing to resist the impact of sport activity.
