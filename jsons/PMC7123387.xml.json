These mechanisms are facilitated by the integrity of the epithelium lining the trachea, bronchi, and small airways. The complete disruption of the bronchial circulation during lung transplantation can cause a loss of epithelium integrity and associated mucociliary action, which may not fully recover despite development of collateral flow in the future [1, 2, 6, 8, 9]. Additional compromise of the anatomical barrier to infection is created by the potential suppression of the cough reflex caused by denervation of the allograft [4, 7]. Disruption of the normal lymphatic flow of the lung during transplantation also increases the risk of infections by creating edema and stasis of interstitial fluids [4, 7].",

Evidence suggests LTRs who are greater than 1 year from surgery are five times more likely to present with CARV infections compared to those less than 1 year from transplantation [2, 14, 21].",

Obliterative bronchiolitis, the hallmark of BOS, appears to be the pathologic end-stage of a process initially beginning with airway epithelial injury and leading to inflammatory reactions that promote airway obliteration. The inciting injury to the epithelium may be initiated as an exposure to toxic chemicals or drugs, infection including to viral agents, or an autoimmune process [3, 29, 30]. Airway inflammation and injury resulting from both the number and severity of episodes of acute rejection are also thought to play an important role in the development of CLAD [3, 30].",

Meanwhile the activity of CMV within the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle induces the upregulation of adhesion molecules which promote further proliferation and activity of inflammatory cells in the graft, leading to development of rejection. CMV has been thought to play an additional role in the development of rejection by the process of molecular mimicry, where the immune response against viral antigens leads to the production of anti-endothelial antibodies within the graft [2, 42, 57, 58, 60, 61].",

The most common symptoms of RhV infection include rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, with fevers and myalgias being relatively uncommon. Meanwhile, infections with influenza and paramyxoviruses (RSV and PIV) are almost always associated with symptoms and much more likely to be febrile illnesses [14, 67, 70]. Lower respiratory tract involvement with radiographic manifestation is typically rare except in the case of influenza. Infections with influenza and paramyxoviruses are also more than twice as likely to result in hospitalization compared with RhV and coronavirus, with nearly 50% of cases requiring admission [14, 21, 70].",

Treatment decisions are commonly dependent on the severity of disease, and inhaled ribavirin is most often the route of choice for severe RSV infections. Inhaled ribavirin has many drawbacks: administration requires a hospital admission and an extended inhalation interval, and it can be teratogenic to women of child-bearing age. Because of these factors of the medication, appropriate precautions should be taken [82]. Intravenous ribavirin has reported success, although it is only available through compassionate use in the United States [82, 83]. Adjunctive therapy using pavilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulin has been used, with little published efficacy [82, 88]. Lastly, presatovir and ALN-RSV01 are medications undergoing phase II clinical trials to assess the efficacy of these novel antiviral agents for the treatment of RSV infections in lung transplant patients [89].\n",

Therefore, it is essential to ensure all close contacts of lung transplant recipients are also vaccinated. There are two types of influenza vaccines available: the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine and the intramuscular inactivated vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in transplant recipients; therefore, the inactivated vaccine is to be administered. Due to the intensity of immunosuppression directly posttransplant and concern of decreased immunogenicity, vaccinations are often withheld directly after transplantation. According to the American Society of Transplantation, a reasonable time frame is to wait at least 3 months after transplant before influenza vaccine administration [82] .",

The neuraminidase inhibitors are preferred agents to treat influenza [82]. M2 inhibitors are no longer recommended due to increased resistance and inactivity to influenza A and B, respectively [82]. Oseltamivir is commercially available as a capsule and suspension; zanamivir is administered as an inhalation and peramivir as an infusion [102\u2013104]. Currently, the IV formulation of zanamivir and oseltamivir are only available as an investigational use, and not commercially available. Oseltamivir is the most used antiviral to treat influenza in the lung transplant population; zanamivir and peramivir lack data for severe disease and for treatment of hospitalized patients [101, 105]. The usual duration of therapy for influenza A or B treatment is 5 days, although immunosuppressed patients, including lung transplant recipients, may have prolonged viral replication and also have an increased risk of developing antiviral resistance; therefore, longer duration of therapy can be considered [82, 105]. Dosing and duration of therapy is presented in Table 15.2.",

In addition, as many as 50% of PCR-documented cases of RhV infections in transplant recipients have few to no symptoms at the time of surveillance testing [106, 108, 112]. The typical clinical presentation involves an afebrile upper respiratory illness with rhinorrhea and sinus congestion. It is sometimes associated with sore throat and cough. Coinfections with other pathogens complicate many cases of RhV infection in LTR and may contribute significantly to the relatively high morbidity and mortality rates observed [110].",

This drug should be utilized with caution; cidofovir administration is associated with significant adverse reactions, primarily neutropenia and nephrotoxicity, both of which are pronounced with lung transplant [120, 121]. In order to mitigate nephrotoxicity caused by cidofovir, probenacid and hydration should be added to the regimen [121]. Probenacid is administered 3 h before, 3 h after, and 8 h after cidofovir, along with hydration with normal saline [120, 121]. As adjunct to reduced immunosuppression with or without cidofovir, immunoglobulin may be considered, primarily in patients with hypogammaglobinemia [120], although the benefits of IVIG in the setting of adenovirus infection with or without hypogammaglobinemia are still not clear. In the future, brincidofovir (CMX001), a lipid conjugate of cidofovir which is currently in clinical trials, may be a viable option\n. Benefits of this dosage form may include an oral formulation, higher potency, and less nephrotoxicity.",

Recommendations for prophylaxis of CMV disease in lung transplant recipients are based on donor and recipient IGG serostatus (Table 15.4). For patients at the highest risk for developing CMV disease, donor IGG positive and recipient IGG negative (D+/R\u2212), prophylaxis with IV ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or a combination of both is recommended [136]. The duration of prophylaxis varies, but at least 12 months of prophylaxis is recommended, with some centers extending prophylaxis beyond 12 months [136, 142]. As adjunct to chemoprophylaxis, CMV immune globulin can also be considered for the D+/R\u2212 high-risk group of patients [136]. For moderate-risk recipient IGG seropositive recipients, IV ganciclovir or valganciclovir is recommended for 6\u201312 months [136, 142, 143]. For low-risk donor and recipient IGG seronegative negative patients, no CMV-specific prophylaxis is necessary [136, 142]. HSV prophylaxis with acyclovir is still indicated, but neither ganciclovir nor valganciclovir is required [35, 142, 144] (Table 15.4). Preemptive therapy, i.e., withholding valganciclovir or IV ganciclovir prophylaxis and monitoring patients on a weekly basis for CMV viremia then treating to prevent disease progression, is generally not recommended in lung transplant recipients [136].\n",

Ganciclovir resistance is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and there are few options when it comes to treatment [145]. Current drugs of choice are either foscarnet or cidofovir, both of which are highly toxic and require extended hospitalizations when initiating therapy. Resistance is usually due to a mutation of the UL97 gene and less commonly the UL54 gene [136, 145]. The UL97 mutation does not confer resistance to cidofovir or foscarnet, but the UL54 mutation may confer resistance to all three medications and is therefore more difficult to treat [136, 145]. Many times as adjunct to cidofovir or foscarnet transplant, centers consider discontinuation of the current antimetabolite and initiating leflunomide, which has both antiviral and antimetabolite properties [146, 147]. Future options for treatment of CMV include maribavir and brincidofovir (CMX001), both of which are currently in clinical trials and not available for use [148, 149]. No matter the situation, treatment of ganciclovir-resistant CMV\nshould be undertaken with caution and on a case by case basis.",

In about 60% of cases, KS lesions are confined to skin and mucosa of the oropharynx, while the remainder can exhibit involvement of internal organs and lymph nodes [163]. In the last few decades, a mounting number of cases of KS in LTR have brought recognition to HHV 8 as an important pathogen in the setting of lung transplantation [163, 164]. KS, considered a rare malignancy in LTR, can manifest with involvement of the allograft as bronchial and pleural disease, as well as cutaneous lesions or involvement of other viscera such as the gastric or intestinal tracts [163\u2013166]. It should be considered in patients with characteristic skin lesions and pulmonary disease, including hemorrhagic pleural effusions that are typically rich in HHV-8 viral particles and DNA when tested [166].
