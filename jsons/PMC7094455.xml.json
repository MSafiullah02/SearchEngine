On enrollment, patients completed a questionnaire documenting the nature and duration of their presenting symptoms, smoking history, allergies, medications, and occupation. In the emergency room during the initial evaluation and treatment, spirometry was performed. In keeping with the patient's best interest, treatment was not delayed and, in some cases, was initiated before performance of spirometry.\n",

The swab was immersed in 1 mL of Hank's balanced saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, penicillin (1000 \u03bcg/mL), streptomycin (1,000 \u03bcg/mL), amphotericin B (20 \u03bcg/mL), and kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) and either immediately evaluated for virus or stored at 4\u00b0 C for up to 24 h until virus assay could be performed. To detect viral antigen in infected nasal epithelial cells, an indirect immunofluorescent staining technique was performed according to standard procedures using detection kits obtained from Bartels (Baxter Diagnostics, Bellevue, Washington). Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifugation at 900 g, the supernatant was aspirated and cultured for virus, as discussed later, and the cell pellet was resuspended in a few drops of PBS. After fixing to a glass slide, the cells were initially incubated with the specific antiviral murine antibody at 37\u00b0 C for 30 min. After rinsing with PBS, an antimouse immunoglobulin that was conjugated to Fluorescein isothiocyanate was added to the cell preparation at 37\u00b0 C for 30 min. After washing, the cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope. Uninfected cells were used as a control.\n",

Using these assays, during the months of the study, the Clinical Virology Laboratory at University Hospitals successfully isolated RSV (188 specimens), parainfluenza 3 (16 specimens), influenza B (21 specimens), and adenovirus (6 specimens).

It remains to be determined whether these newer technologies will afford greater detection of viral precipitants of asthma. For example, Beasley et al11 examined nasopharyngeal specimens with electron microscopy. Despite the use of electron microscopic methods, only 1 of 39 viral pathogens was identified. Thus, it is unlikely that the use of electron microscopy sufficiently explains the disparity in the incidence of viral infection in severe asthma discovered in the current study and that of Beasley et al.11 In contrast, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), by showing viral genes in clinical specimens,15 may significantly improve our ability to document infection due to specific viral pathogens that are difficult to culture. In one study, PCR documented 50% of rhinovirus infections in children who were symptomatic.16 Although PCR shows promise as a more definitive diagnostic tool for certain viral infections, its current clinical application is limited by availability.",

            "text": "Certain viral pathogens including coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, which are purported to cause a significant percentage of upper respiratory tract infections, are poorly or not at all detected by current methods used in the clinical setting. Rhinoviruses are one of the more important causes of respiratory viral illnesses that have been implicated in post-viral airway hyperreactivity.9 In the series of Beasley et al,11 rhinovirus infection was documented by cell culture in 22% of the exacerbations of adult asthmatic subjects. In addition, Beasley et al11 found that rhinovirus accounted for 30% of severe exacerbations in asthma. Thus, rhinovirus may be the precipitant of a greater percentage of severe exacerbations of asthma in adults. The diagnosis of rhinovirus infection is hampered by the multiplicity of viral serotypes, and to date, serologic diagnosis of rhinovirus is unavailable in clinical laboratories. The highest yield of virus isolation is from the nasopharyngeal specimen in the first 3 to 5 days of illness. In our study, despite obtaining culture material at a mean symptom duration of 3.95 days (only 2 of 35 specimens were collected after 1 week of symptoms), we were unable to recover rhinovirus or any other virus species by standard culture technique and direct antigen detection. Although the permissiveness of different cell lines to rhinovirus infection varies, our culture conditions of incubation at 35\u00b0 C with inoculation onto MRC-5 cells, a commonly used cell line, should be able to support rhinovirus replication. Regardless of the limitations of current virologic techniques, our lack of rhinovirus isolation from our patient population suggests that rhinovirus may not be as frequent a precipitant of asthma in adults requiring emergency department evaluation.",

While Beasley et al,11 enrolled and followed up patients in an outpatient clinic over the course of 1 year, our study was specifically designed to examine adult asthmatic subjects as they presented to the emergency department for treatment. Since previous studies both in children and adults suggested an increased incidence of virus infections in severe asthma,3, 5, 11, 14 and since more severe episodes of asthma require emergency department evaluation and treatment, we expected a much higher recovery of viruses from the asthmatic subjects in our study. In contrast to predictions, and despite the methodical limitations for the detection of rhinovirus or coronavirus, we surprisingly did not find any evidence of an increased incidence of viral infections using our emergency department enrollment protocol that selected for a group of asthmatic subjects with more critical airway obstruction. These results suggest that severe exacerbations of asthma in adults who seek emergency treatment may not be precipitated by viral infections regardless of symptoms to the contrary.",

Although 55.9% of the patients in the current study reported one or more symptoms suggestive of a viral syndrome\u2014fever, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, or myalgia\u2014we were unable to document a viral cause in any patient. While the specific causes of the febrile reactions reported by five patients were not immediately apparent, the presence of fever may suggest a concomitant bacterial process. In a similar manner, Tarlo et al,13 reported that although asthmatic patients complained of more cold symptoms, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, fever, cough, and hoarseness, they had a lower frequency of objectively confirmed virus respiratory infection than their nonasthmatic spouses. Overall, Tarlo et al13 found that regardless of symptoms, only 3% of asthma exacerbations were associated with confirmed viral infections. Although in both studies these symptomatic episodes may be attributable to allergic manifestations in atopic individuals, an alternate explanation is that the symptoms are a result of the inflammatory response engendered in an exacerbation of asthma. Thus, in general, a viral upper respiratory tract infection as a precipitant of asthma probably is overdiagnosed by symptoms alone.",

Despite the presence of clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of a viral respiratory infection, other precipitants of acute asthma requiring emergency department evaluation should be sought. Further elucidation of the precipitating factors of acute severe asthma in adults would permit optimization of emergency medical treatment. In addition, by identifying potential precipitants of acute asthma in adults, more effective prophylactic measures can be instituted.",
