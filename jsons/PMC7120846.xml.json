The triffids are monstrous precisely because they transgress the limitations of plant life, originally defined by the ancient Greek philosophers in negative terms as life without locomotion or perception. The tripod limbs of the triffids, however, endow them with mobility, and their ability to rattle little sticks against their stems gives them the ability to communicate, thereby drawing them closer to the traditional category of the animal. The survivors also attribute a third monstrous attribute to the triffids\u2014namely, the \u201capparent ability to learn\u201d (Wyndham 2003, p. 200)\u2014and it is this latter feature in particular that promises radically to decenter the survivors\u2019 anthropocentric worldview and debunk the assumed superiority of the human intellect. The concept of plant-thought constitutes a challenge to the metaphysical boundary between plant and animal, and, by extension, the philosophical matrix that grants agency (only) to humanity and legitimizes the consumption of natural resources.",

            "text": "In contesting the anthropocentric worldview, the triffids trouble not only the categories of plant, animal, and human, but also the very notion of categorization itself. The majority of horror novels can be read as a conduit for anxieties concerning the potential of contamination from an alien Other, be it the animal in H. G. Wells\u2019s The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896) and Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (1897), technology in Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (1818), the cosmic in H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s Cthulhu mythos (1928), the demonic in Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), or the dead in myriad ghost stories. Wyndham\u2019s text does not entirely fit into this schema since it dwells on the absolute alterity of the plant. Whereas transgression of the above categories is plausible and can be said to occur already to varying degrees, the alterity of the plant is such that plant-thought can only be represented through two extremes: either complete absence, or a completely fantastical presence, as seen in the second chapter of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Through the Looking-Glass (1872), in which the flowers awaken and discuss Alice\u2019s anatomical features using vegetal signifiers such as \u201cpetals\u201d to describe her (p. 14). The sequence is clearly demarcated as fantasy, and the plants are rendered as little more than stationary people, which has the effect of reinforcing the division between plant and human. By contrast, the triffids trouble such classifications and appear, instead, as unknowable and alien. In response, the humans tend to anthropomorphize them in an effort to incorporate the creatures into their worldview. Rather than models of plant intelligence, then, the triffids serve as projections for human imaginings and unconscious desires.",

This bleak prospect suggests that the rise of the triffids heralds the dawn of a new dark age, in which the infrastructure and expertise required to generate and disseminate complex specialist knowledge is no longer possible. Whereas the survivors must face the difficulties involved in the creation and circulation of knowledge, the triffids appear to possess a collective intelligence that enables them to learn from the demise of individual plants over time. This is a form of thought that is entirely alien to subject-object relations. As triffid expert Walter Lucknor declares, early in the novel, the triffids possess \u201can altogether different type of intelligence\u201d (Wyndham 2003, p. 35; emphasis added). While many of the survivors continue to draw upon known metaphysical categories in an attempt to come to terms with a world that has irrevocably changed, the triffids signal a queering of the relationship between plant, animal, and human that constitutes a subversion of received notions of order and knowledge. In eschewing the binaries of subject and object, life and death, interiority and exteriority, the individual and the collective, the triffids occupy the placeless place of the Freudian unconscious.",

Such an approach constitutes a weak decentering, in which the primacy of the human is simply replaced with that of the plant, rather than a deconstructive approach in which the very relation between center and periphery is dissolved. Following the initial discovery of the triffids, the threat they pose, primarily in the form of their stingers, is swiftly identified and contained. However, the human population is subsequently blinded by a cascade of green light from the skies that is initially assumed to be fragments from a comet burning in the atmosphere but is later strongly implied to be caused by man-made satellites. As with Oedipus, the survivors\u2019 literal blindness is echoed by their failure to recognize their own role in shaping their destiny. Reading their self-made destruction as the effect of an external alien presence, the human characters mimic the category error of projecting their own motivations onto the instinctual behavior of the triffids.",

This formulation presents a relation between plant-thought and the unconscious conceived of as thought that occurs unbeknownst to the subject and that is resistant to representation. Plants and the unconscious initially appear oppositional since they are identified through degrees, respectively, of externality and intimacy. This seeming contradiction is resolved through recourse to Lacan\u2019s neologism \u201cextimacy\u201d (extimit\u00e9), which postulates that the most intimate experience is paralleled only by the outermost insofar as both are unknowable to the subject and accordingly function as vessels for unconscious desire (Miller 1994, pp. 74\u201387). We also witness this antinomic reasoning in plant life, which simultaneously strives upwards through shoots that reach towards the sun while roots drive downwards into the earth. Positioned as a foreign element of non-thought, triffid-thought (and, by extension, plant-thought) is thus structured like the unconscious.",

            "text": "Due to the unknowability of plant-thought, the human survivors ineluctably anthropomorphize the triffids, projecting their own unconscious fears and desires onto them in the process. Since the unconscious can only be known through gaps in perception, eschewing metaphysical binaries of subject and object, life and death, interiority and exteriority, individual and collective, the attribution of human characteristics to otherwise arbitrary and instinctual behavior signals unconscious desire and the limits of anthropocentric thought. Since the horror in Wyndham\u2019s novel is predicated upon the implication that the non-human triffids can think and surpass the humans, this interpretation demands that we read the novel against the grain and treat the reader as one who is duped by his or her own cynicism. Throughout the text the characters express disbelief, shock, and skepticism at the notion that plants can think while, at the same time, continually anthropomorphizing the creatures; this double-coding of the triffids paradoxically buttresses the reader\u2019s suspension of disbelief and presents a false conception of plant-thought that is really the projection of human self-conceptions and values. When the protagonist, Bill Masen, and his companion, Josella Playton, drive down the London streets, they witness triffids roaming in the wake of a human mob. Playton exclaims: \u201c\u2018Did\u2014did you see what that was? They were driving them\u2019\u201d (Wyndham 2003, p. 63). In the face of humans reduced to their animalistic instinct, Playton ascribes human motivations to the plants. However, this utterance simply reverses the hierarchy between human and plant, rather than offering a wholesale deconstruction of the notion of a center. Playton\u2019s use of the word \u201cdriving\u201d signals that language is an irremediably human artefact that, in its communication of human scale, dimensions, interests, and desires, renders the world intelligible as a set of systems of dominance and subjection, activity and passivity, absence and presence.",

            "text": "When we acknowledge the short circuit produced by the spectators\u2019 cynicism, the triffids\u2019 seemingly planned actions appear more akin to a set of built-in responses to stimuli. In the village of Steeple Honey, a man who had been concealed within a church runs out of the doorway towards the approaching car and is immediately assailed by a lurking triffid. Masen\u2019s new companion, Wilfred Coker, expresses incredulity at the sight:\u201cIt was\u2014no, damn it, it can\u2019t have been waiting for him?\u201d he said. \u201cIt must have just happened\u2026. It couldn\u2019t have known he\u2019d come out of that door\u2026. I mean, it couldn\u2019t\u2014could it?\u201d\u201cOr could it? It was a remarkably neat piece of work,\u201d I said. (Wyndham 2003, p. 152)Coker\u2019s incredulity paradoxically renders the attribution of intelligence to the plant more believable since his cynicism does the work of the reader\u2019s own skepticism, thereby disarming that reader\u2019s critical faculties. The characters are cynical, in other words, so that we do not need to be. The logic of cynical reason reaches its apotheosis when Masen contemplates the possibility that triffids can speak, right before claiming that \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of conspiracy not to believe things about triffids\u201d (p. 153). Rather than directly making the claim that triffids can speak, Masen implies it and thereby creates the illusion that the reader has reached this conclusion on their own. However, such considerations are little more than the projection of human attributes onto plant life, as demonstrated when Masen encounters two more triffids in a field: \u201cI waited until they paused and then decapitated both of them\u201d (p. 153). The use of the word \u201cdecapitation\u201d is an act of anthropomorphism since it specifically indexes cutting off a person\u2019s head, an anatomical part that triffids conspicuously lack. Plants, indeed, do not possess a center: their leaves, roots, and seeds are a combination of supplementary and superficial elements (Marder 2013, p. 81). Masen\u2019s description of the triffids, then, signals the difficulties involved in representing the ontology, capacities, and interests of non-humans\u2014as well as the uncertain limits of anthropomorphism.",

All human knowledge,\u201d Clark continues, \u201cmust needs be anthropomorphic in some way\u201d (p. 193). Rather than seeking to set limits to anthropomorphism, The Day of the Triffids leaves the question of whether plants think in abeyance and, instead, demonstrates how seemingly inconsequential word choices construct the non-human Other as a familiar reflection of ourselves.

For instance, the triffids consistently direct their stings at humans\u2019 heads, meaning that children and those who wear helmets frequently escape unscathed. This is not an intelligent assault based on the triffids\u2019 knowledge of human weaknesses, since they continue to sting their opponents even if they are wearing protective gear; instead, this is a response stimulated by external shifts in the environment. Masen notes that it \u201clooked as if the triffids only ambushed in places where there was soft earth for them to dig their roots into while they waited\u201d (Wyndham 2008, p. 188).1 Although the status of anthropomorphic language is ultimately irresolvable, the most logical conclusion to be drawn from this behavior would be that the triffids seek soft earth so that they can extend their roots and seek nourishment. By contrast, Masen reads the triffids as setting an ambush and waiting, and later presents them as \u201carmed\u201d (p. 62) usurpers of the Earth (Wyndham 2003, pp. 194\u2013195).

Throughout the novel Masen, Playton, and others speak in hushed tones when triffids are nearby despite the triffids\u2019 lack of hearing apparatus. Not only does such a gesture imply that the triffids can hear, but their actions also ascribe intelligence and understanding to the plants. When Masen does imagine plant-thought, he does not present an image of radical alterity but offers, instead, a simplistic inversion of human thought: \u201cFrom a triffid point of view, a city must be much like a desert, so I should think they\u2019ll be moving outward toward the open country on the whole\u201d (Wyndham 2003, p. 91). Masen\u2019s construction of a triffid\u2019s perspective does little more than theorize a reversal of the (human) population shift from the country to the city, reaffirming the validity of the urban-rural binary in the process. Furthermore, Masen deploys instrumentalist logic when he imagines that the city is barren to the triffids and therefore lacking the conditions that would normally sustain plant life. These assumptions about plant-thought display the structure and limitations of dialectics\u2014an oppositional logic blind to the diffuse and the impartial. The ascription of an autotelic nature to the vegetal points to the insufficiency of language in conceptualizing an alternative subject to the human.",

For instance, reference is made to Elspeth Cary\u2019s fictional history of the colony established by Masen and the other survivors. At the start of the novel, Masen explains in a direct address to the reader that his narrative will necessarily employ the language of the past (the reader\u2019s present) in order to describe his present (the reader\u2019s future): \u201cIt involves a great deal that has vanished forever, but I can\u2019t tell it any other way than by using the words we used to use for those vanished things, so they have to stand\u201d (Wyndham 2003, p. 19). In order to make the world of the triffids intelligible to a contemporary audience, Masen claims that it is necessary to use language reflective of the implied reader\u2019s situation, which suggests that Masen\u2019s conception of himself and the world has fundamentally changed. As we have seen, however, Masen struggles to present thought beyond the constraints of metaphysics. The question of whether the fault lies with Masen or the linguistic tools he is equipped with remains in abeyance. In this respect, the extended passage in which various members of the population attempt to determine a suitable designation for the triffids\u2014including names ranging from Trichots to Trippets and that draw on the Latin terms for walking or traversing (ambulans) and \u201cprojections that serve in locomotion\u201d (pseudopodia)\u2014once again indicates that language is irremediably anthropocentric (pp. 28\u201329).

Although these literary allusions are relevant to the novel\u2019s themes, they have little bearing on the survivors in the vegetal world of the future when such reminders of hubris and mortality are no longer necessary. Instead, the literary is presented as the language of the past, as a time when cognition was oriented along anthropocentric lines. Although to a contemporary audience the allusions challenge conceptions of the human as dominant, it is a challenge achieved only at the cost of emphasizing literature\u2019s redundancy within the alternative future of the triffids.",

The novel was published by Michael Joseph as part of a series edited by the novelist Clemence Dane entitled \u201cNovels of the Future\u201d (Wolfe 2003, p. 107), and yet it portrays a return to the rural past. Prior to the catastrophe, Custance worked as an engineer as part of the post-war project of reconstruction and urbanization, and the quest to reach his brother\u2019s farmstead signals a retreat to the organic community that pre-existed the Industrial Revolution. This retreat is a continuation of the trope established by Wyndham who named his protagonist Bill Masen, one letter removed from the word \u201cmason.\u201d In this respect, Wyndham\u2019s and Christopher\u2019s work constitutes a counter-narrative to the prospect of material prosperity and social opportunity promised by the nation\u2019s renewed commitment to and faith in scientific progress, technocracy, bureaucracy, and the rise of the expert in the post-war period. Where they differ is in their approach to the vegetal: Wyndham\u2019s novel is concerned with an overabundance of plant life, while Christopher depicts a world in which vegetation is notable for its absence.",

The virus emerges in China before spreading across the rest of the world, and, in scenes that echo the Great Chinese Famine of 1958\u20131961, which resulted in an estimated number of deaths ranging from fifteen to forty-five million, Custance and his family bear witness as starvation and chaos sweep across East Asia before the virus unexpectedly reaches British shores. In the novel the death rate is estimated by the United Nations to be over two hundred million people (Christopher 2009, p. 18). By comparison, in 1961, the population of China was just over six hundred million and that of the UK approximately fifty million. The novel\u2019s allusions to starvation on a global scale graphically illustrate humanity\u2019s reliance on vegetal life, which Marder (2013) terms \u201cthe most mundane and unobtrusive instance of alterity\u201d (p. 36). Prior to the catastrophe, plants are viewed in instrumental terms as either a resource to be harvested, or as something standing in the way of progress and development, yet, following the outbreak of the virus, Custance learns that the signifier \u201cgrass\u201d or gramineae is a homogenizing term that incorporates more than 10,000 domesticated and wild species and constitutes approximately twenty percent of the vegetation covering the Earth (Christopher 2009, p. 23). Whereas The Day of the Triffids demonstrates the ineluctable nature of anthropocentricity both in thought and in language, The Death of Grass highlights the invisibility, the assumed silence and, consequently, the subaltern status of plant life under the auspices of the Anthropocene.",

While characters repeatedly voice their sympathy for \u201cthe poor wretched Chinese\u201d (Christopher 2009, p. 12), they also self-consciously reflect on the limits of their philanthropic impulses, and, once the UK succumbs to the virus, they concede that despite their intentions, the demands of personal survival overrode the moral duty to care for others. When Custance\u2019s wife, Ann, comments on their own capacity for disavowal in the face of suffering\u2014\u201c\u2018we can talk and laugh and joke,\u2019 she said, \u2018in a land as peaceful and rich as this, while that goes on\u2019\u201d (p. 13)\u2014her comments index not only the effects of the fictional Chung-Li virus, but also the reception of stories of starving children reported in the Western media during the novel\u2019s composition. Although Ann and her family are aware of the famine in China and feel compassion for the victims, they feel powerless to change anything and treat the events as a memento mori that serves mostly to render them grateful for their own more fortunate circumstances. As Custance later remarks to his friend, Roger Buckley, who works as a Public Relations officer for the Ministry of Production, the subject of repopulating the now-barren lands of Asia has not been broached by either the government or the media. Buckley\u2019s cynical response is that \u201cwe try not to think of them too much, don\u2019t we? It\u2019s as though we had managed to chop off the rest of the world, and left just Europe, Africa, Australasia, and the Americas\u201d (p. 37). In this respect, the novel offers a commentary on Occidental responses to human suffering on the world stage. Buckley and other minor characters occasionally make racially insensitive comments and imply that the virus is a result of Communism, or instigated as a form of population control. This stance is sometimes but not always contested by Custance who, himself, becomes increasingly distanced from the suffering of others and eventually shoots his brother in order to claim the valley and secure the safety of his newly-formed tribe. Consequently, The Death of Grass demonstrates the ever-decreasing circle within which a duty of care for the Other is formed, depicting what happens when the politics of pragmatism steadily override moral considerations and the survivors adopt increasingly violent methods to survive.",

            "text": "In posing ethical considerations regarding the limitations of the duty of care for the Other, the novel employs the death of grass as a metaphor for human suffering, although, as I will later suggest, it is possible to reverse the metaphor and read the death of grass with the pathos we would normally reserve for the loss of human life. In Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, the population of the USA is simultaneously unified yet individualized by analogy to grass and soil. As Jerome Loving (1999) notes, the title is a pun: \u201cgrass\u201d refers to works of \u201cdubious value\u201d and \u201cleaves\u201d to the pages they are printed on (p. 179). Whitman\u2019s poem plays on the notion that \u201cgrass\u201d is of lesser value, yet also renders that notion ironically in a manner that informs Christopher\u2019s novel. Individual blades of grass are rarely seen as discrete plants; the word \u201cgrass\u201d is a mass noun, which suggests that each blade is merely a minor variation on a type. In this respect, The Death of Grass implies that the Western response to the famine in China was to regard human lives as a series of indistinguishable blades of grass, submerged in a homogeneous mass. Every signifier carries within it the trace of its opposite, and, in this respect, a country that possesses a landmass broadly equivalent to the USA but with four times the population bears with it not only the trace of the fecundity of life, but also the possibility of death on an unimaginable scale. This perspective is alluded to when Buckley refers to a set of unpublished photographs of central China:I hadn\u2019t understood properly before quite what a clean sweep the virus makes of a place. Automatically, you think of it as leaving some grass growing, if only a few tufts here and there. But it doesn\u2019t leave anything. It\u2019s only the grasses that have gone, of course, but it\u2019s surprising to realize what a large amount of territory is covered with grasses of one kind or another. (Christopher 2009, pp. 37\u201338)In this passage, the virus is depicted in terms that are reminiscent of the human exploitation of natural resources. It is bestial\u2014\u201cit was able to go ahead and show its teeth\u201d (p. 23)\u2014rendering it closer to human than plant life. Like the human, the Chung-Li virus consumes all forms of grass in an effort to sustain itself, while Buckley\u2019s surprise at the extent to which vegetation covers the land emphasizes the insignificance of the vegetal. In this respect, the novel primarily (but not exclusively) depicts appeals to protect the environment as predicated upon the notion that plant life is a resource subordinate to and serving human civilization, rather than as a life form worth preserving for itself.",

When the novel is situated within its historical context, the wastelands appear analogous to the mass graves of the two world wars, the effects of atomic weaponry, and the outbreaks of famine and disease that assailed humanity over the course of the twentieth century. If we reverse the analogy, though, and view the destruction of plant life with the same emotion that we would treat human life, the sheer impossibility of thinking what that would mean reveals the degree to which plant life is treated not as life, but as mundane matter. The stretches of bare earth, what had once been rich and blooming landscapes, evoke primarily sensations of familiarity: \u201cJohn looked out at what had been the lawn and was now a patch of brown earth speckled with occasional weeds. Already it had become familiar\u201d (Christopher 2009, p. 41). This familiarity signals the extent to which plant life (and its absence) blurs into the environment, becoming so mundane as to become invisible. The only voice of dissent is that of Custance\u2019s brother, who lives off the land and claims that plant life should be recognized as life in itself, independent from human needs and desires: \u201cFor years now, we\u2019ve treated the land as though it were a piggy-bank, to be raided. And the land, after all, is life itself\u201d (p. 41). Meanwhile, for Custance, the significance of the death of grass continues to lie in its catastrophic effects on human civilization; this instrumentalist perspective renders the specificity of the catastrophe opaque. Reading plant death as either a cause of or a metaphor for human death once again returns plant life to its subaltern status as the invisible Other against which humans derive their identity.",

As Augustin Berque (2013) argues in Thinking through Landscape, the landscape is all too often seen but not taken as an object of contemplation. I would suggest, moreover, that Marder\u2019s (2013) conceptualization of the absolute alterity of the plant bears similarities with Freud\u2019s description of the unconscious, especially when we consider that the radical core of Freud\u2019s thesis was lost through a process of cultural translation. When psychoanalysis was brought across the Atlantic, it was re-envisioned in the form of Ego psychiatry\u2014the professional attempt to reclaim the will in the face of the seemingly chaotic forces of unconscious desire. This instrumentalist view of the unconscious echoes the modern conception of plant life as it attempts to attribute use-value and foreclose the idea of plant life as life independent of human intervention. Both The Day of the Triffids and The Death of Grass suggest that human encounters with the vegetal only occur when plants are assigned a use-value as either fuel or as an ingredient for consumption, or alternatively when they become obstructive to human telos. In this respect, Marder (2013) detects a crucial similarity in the rhetoric of both industrialists and environmental campaigners: the \u201cinstrumental approach to plants synthesizes in itself the rationale for deforestation and the defense of forests as \u2018the lungs of the planet,\u2019 seeing that both arguments fail to take into account vegetal life as life, aside from the external ends it might be called to serve\u201d (p. 25). Treating the landscape depicted in The Death of Grass as analogous to the unconscious suggests the ways in which plant life may actually communicate, albeit in a manner that is typically imperceptible to human logos; in effect, the landscape speaks.",

            "text": "The depiction of the absence of vegetal life in The Death of Grass is highly evocative of the ways in which plants can be understood to speak through spatial extension, to which humans are typically indifferent. Marder (2013) conceives of this form of communication as \u201cthe spatial relations and articulations between beings, animate or inanimate\u201d (p. 75). Human indifference to spatial extension is keenly observed in the novel when Custance crosses the Pennines and recalls childhood memories of his surroundings: \u201cThere had been a sense of isolation about the pass even then, a feeling of being in a country swept of life, despite the road and the railway line that hugged it\u201d (p. 137). The personified actions of the man-made road and railway line contrast sharply with Custance\u2019s inability to perceive plant life as life. Instead, life is equated only with human life to the extent that even when the inanimate products of human life are imbued with vitality, plant life does not signify at all. We might also conceptualize the ways in which plants communicate by analogy to Plato\u2019s (1997) distinction between speech and writing. For Plato, writing is an impersonal and mechanical product in contrast to speech that supposedly offers direct access to the speaker\u2019s thoughts and that can be adapted in response to its reception. He argues that speeches are orphaned as soon as they are written: \u201cWhen it has once been written down, every discourse roams about everywhere, reaching indiscriminately those with understanding no less than those who have no business with it.\u2026 And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly,\u201d he continues, \u201cit always needs its father\u2019s support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support\u201d (p. 552). Plant life lacks speech organs and communicates instead through its materiality and its posture. Like Plato\u2019s definition of writing, however, such a form of communication cannot conceal itself, cannot respond to external stimuli, and cannot control its reception. For these reasons, plant \u201cspeech\u201d typically remains opaque to human observers.",

Plant life typically fails to signify as life in itself since it appears as a quotidian aspect of the landscape. The depiction of civilizational collapse in British post-war science fiction, however, highlights the interdependency of plant and human life. In The Day of the Triffids, the survivors ascribe intelligence to the vegetal monsters, which threatens to destabilize the primacy of the human. The survivors nonetheless fail adequately to conceptualize the alterity of plant-thought and seek, instead, to anthropomorphize the triffids, consequently rendering them merely receptacles for their unconscious desires. This procedure simply replaces the human with the triffid, rather than enacting a radical deconstruction of the metaphysical concept of margin and center. In other words, the survivors exhibit the logic of cynical reason that reaffirms the false conception of plant-thought as a mirror of human thought. With this logic in mind, the triffids\u2019 actions appear as instinctual responses to external stimuli rather than elements of an alien intelligence. The Day of the Triffids opens up the question of whether plants think and signals that such thought would not simply be the projection or inversion of human thought but, rather, a form of radical alterity that may exceed the limits of perhaps irremediably anthropocentric language.",
