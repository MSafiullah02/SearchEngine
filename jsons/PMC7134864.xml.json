The issue of infection control in ICUs has not been specifically addressed by the guidelines from WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A special infection-control policy has been implemented at our ICU to avoid transmission.",

During the outbreak, the unit is only open to patients with SARS to avoid infection of other patients. All staff and visitors are instructed to put on gowns, gloves, caps, and masks in a designated area before they enter the unit, which are discarded at the end of the visit. Designated \u201cpolice nurses\u201d are present at the entrance of the unit to ensure compliance. Regular spot checks are done to ensure the correct fitting of masks. Goggles and visors are worn during direct patient care, especially for aerosol generating procedures such as suction or intubation.4 Handwashing is important after contact with patients or their body fluids. Inanimate objects, such as pens, are kept within the unit. Every doctor's pager is protected with a plastic cover, discarded when leaving the ICU environment. Measures are enforced by unannounced twice-daily infection-control rounds to inspect staff compliance.",

Nebulisation and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is avoided for the same reason. For intubated patients, a high efficiency bacterial/viral filter is incorporated into the breathing circuit. A closed-suction system is important to avoid generation of aerosol.",
