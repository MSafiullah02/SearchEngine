The protein has two main functional subunits: a long N\u2010terminal S1 subunit and a relatively short C\u2010terminal S2 subunit. A 200 amino\u2010acid\u2010long RBD is stationed within the S1 subunit of the spike protein that is mainly involved in its interaction with ACE2 receptor.\n6\n, \n7\n, \n10\n Human ACE2 is an 805 amino\u2010acid\u2010long protein with two functional domains: N\u2010terminal peptidase M2 domain and C\u2010terminal collectrin domain. Partial structure of the ACE2 has been resolved (PDBid: 1R42) comprising peptidase M2 domain. Structurally, the peptidase domain has two catalytic subdomains with an active site sandwiched in between the two subdomains.\n24\n Cocrystal structures of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein complexed with human ACE2 (PDBid: 6LZG), SARS\u2010CoV with human ACE2,\n14\n and in vitro mutation analysis of human ACE2\n15\n have identified the critical residues that underpin the interaction between the RBD of viral spike protein and ACE2 peptidase domain. In this study, among the 345 and 242 natural ACE2 coding variants identified from Ensembl Genome Browser and gnomAD, respectively, 17 were found at positions that have shown to be important for the binding of ACE2 with the viral spike protein (Table S1). Allele frequencies of these variants range from 5.45E\u22126 (rs1299103394) to 3.88E\u22123 (rs4646116). To predict the potential pathological consequences rendered by ACE2 alleles, changes in the free energy of ACE2 variants were estimated. The results showed that amino acid substitutions in only three alleles rs73635825 (S19P), rs1299103394 (K26E), and rs766996587 (M82I) may adversely affect the stability of the encoded protein compared with the wild type (Table 1). However, to date, no pathogenic consequences have been reported in relation to these variants in humans. Moreover, except for rs73635825 (S19P), which was predicted to be damaging by only PolyPhen\u20102, different prediction tools designed to assess the functional impact of the mutations and/or single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms did not reveal any ensuing pathogenicity rendered by these variants (Table 1). Conversely, rs961360700 (D355N) and rs762890235 (P389H) were predicted to be detrimental by SIFT and Polyphen\u20102, whereas rs1396769231 (M383T) was predicted to be damaging by SIFT, Polyphen\u20102, and REVEL prediction tools. Nevertheless, no report of any functional impact was found in the literature for these allelic variants of ACE2 as well.",

Structurally, all ACE2 variants bear the characteristic two subdomains of peptidase M2 domain with active site cleft present in between. The overall protein architecture of ACE2 allelic variants is largely conserved with RMSD of C\u03b1 backbone that varies from 0.17 to 0.58 \u00c5, compared with the wild type (Table 1 and Figure 1A,B). Like SARS\u2010CoV, RBD of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein comprises two subdomains: core and extended loop. Cocrystal structures of SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike proteins complexed with ACE2 have demonstrated that the extended loop of RBD directly interacts with loops flanked by \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices and a \u03b2 hairpin loop between \u03b23 and \u03b24 sheets of ACE2.\n7\n, \n14\n The additional residues of ACE2 reported to affect its binding with the viral spike protein by mutation analysis\n15\n lies at C\u2010terminal to these regions. Though the C\u03b1 backbone of ACE2 allelic variants was found to be highly conserved, the spatial orientation of substituting residues varied noticeably compared with the wild type (Figure 1C,D). Therefore, it is possible that these variations in the orientation of amino acid side chain may, in turn, alter the intramolecular interactions in different allelic variants. This consequently may affect the orientation of other critical amino acids of ACE2, otherwise not substituted in the respective variants, but required for the interaction with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.",

All ACE2 variants were found to bind with the viral spike protein with topology nearly identical to the resolved ACE2\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 complex structure (PDBid: 6LZG) (Figure 2A). This is not surprising, as no major structural change was observed in the protein backbone of different ACE2 variants (Figure 1A,B). By and large, the nature and number of intermolecular contacts between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and humans ACE2 variants were found to be comparable (Figure 2B). However, some important variations were observed, for example, compared with a total of 70 interactions found in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and wild\u2010type ACE2 complex, 60 and 81 intermolecular interactions were observed between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and rs143936283 (E329G) and rs961360700 (D355N) variants of ACE2, respectively. Among the six compared types of interactions, the three most strongest, charged\u2010charged, charged\u2010polar, and charged\u2010apolar were found nearly identical between rs961360700 (D355N) and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein compared with the wild\u2010type ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein complex.

This implies that rs143936283 (E329G) in humans may confer some level of resistance against the attachment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to the receptor molecule. However, accounting for the dynamic nature of protein\u2010protein interaction, it is difficult to draw a fair conclusion from simply these observations. Therefore, inter\u2010residual interaction maps were developed for complexes between each ACE2 allelic variant and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.",

            "text": "The recent cocrystal structure of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein with ACE2 (PDBid: 6LZG) highlighted the interaction points of both the proteins (Figure 2C). Many of these interactions were also reported in a previously resolved structure of SARS\u2010CoV spike protein\u2010ACE2 complex (PDBid: 2AJF).\n14\n A representation of the comparison of these interactions for different ACE2 alleles is shown in Figure 2D. Briefly, the most conserved intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds) between different ACE2 variants and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein were found between Y41, H34, Y83, and K353 of ACE2 and T500, Y453 (except M82I), N487 (except T27A and D427Y), and G502 (except S19P and E329G) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, respectively. Similarly, hydrophobic interactions between K31 and K353 of ACE2 and Y489 and Y505 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, respectively, were also found to be conserved in complexes of all ACE2 variants with the viral spike protein. This implies that none of these ACE2 allelic variants offer complete resistance against the attachment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. However, some important variations are noteworthy to mention here. For example, Q42 of wild\u2010type ACE2 interacts with G446 and Q449 of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, but all ACE2 alleles\u2010spike protein complexes did not show any such interaction. The Q42 of ACE2 also interacts with Y449 of the spike protein and this interaction is also absent in ACE2 alleles corresponding to T27A, E35D, E37K, M82I, E329G, and M383T amino acid substitutions. A similar observation was made for the interaction between E35 of ACE2 and Q493 of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein (Figure 2D and Supporting Information Figures). This may suggest that ability of E35 and Q42 to interact with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein could be affected by its spatial positioning in ACE2 protein which may get affected by the change in the intramolecular interaction and/or electrostatic potential due to the substitution in the flanking residues with respect to the three\u2010dimensional conformation of ACE2. Conversely, K353 of ACE2 establishes hydrogen bond interactions with G496 and G502 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. Both these interactions were found to be absent in only the S19P (rs73635825) variant of ACE2. Moreover, the binding affinity of the S19P ACE2 variant for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein was also predicted to be lowest (\u221210.3) among all the alleles including the wild\u2010type ACE2. Similarly, E329G ACE2 variant which was predicted to have the second\u2010lowest binding affinity (\u221210.8) for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein also lacked K353\u2010G502 interaction in the respective complex. It is important to note here that K353 is one of the key residues of ACE2 that not only showed interaction with the spike proteins of both SARS\u2010CoV\n14\n and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but also its substitution in in vitro mutation analysis which has been shown to completely abolish the interaction between ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein.\n15\n Therefore it is likely that rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) alleles of ACE2 may offer some level of resistance against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 attachment with the human ACE2 receptor.",

In vitro assays have shown that expression of ACE2 is positively correlated with the SARS\u2010CoV infection.\n25\n Similarly, genetic variants in ACE2 have been proposed to affect the interaction of the receptor with the viral spike protein.\n15\n Conversely, a recent preliminary study predicts no such link between the human ACE2 variants and coronavirus infection.\n26\n The present study focuses to explore the variation in the binding of the protein encoded by ACE2 coding variants with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.",

Moreover, compared with the wild type, no significant change has been observed in the overall structural conformation of the ACE2 protein variants and the substituted amino acids which are located on one of the subdomains of peptidase M2, distant to the catalytic sites of ACE2.\n24\n Thereby, it is plausible to suggest that these variants of ACE2 may be under neutral selection. Protein molecular modeling and related bioinformatics tool could provide significant insights to predict the potential variations in the protein structures and complexes.\n29\n In the present study, a comparative modeling and molecular superimposition revealed important variations in the intermolecular interaction between ACE2 alleles and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. It is interesting to note that for two ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G), low binding affinity and lack of some of the key residues in the complex formation with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein could be suggestive of intrinsic resistance to some scale against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Therefore, it is conceivable that under new selection pressure as offered by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, these alleles may undergo positive selection. However, as protein\u2010ligand and protein\u2010protein interactions are dynamic,\n30\n therefore the implementation of molecular dynamic simulation could further validate the absence of some of the critical interactions between these ACE2 alleles and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. Consistently, empirical means of deducing binding affinity of intermolecular complexes could also provide important insights in this regard.\n31\n\n",
