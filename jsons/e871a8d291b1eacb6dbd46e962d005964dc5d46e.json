Defective forms of L RNA containing 'core polymerase region' were observed. The full length L RNA of PBNV was sequenced using overlapping cDNA clones. The 8911 nucleotide L RNA contains a single open reading frame (ORF) in the vc strand, and encodes a protein of 330 kDa. At the 5 and 3 termini of the v sense RNA there were 247 and 32 nt untranslated regions, respectively, containing an 18 nt complementary sequence with one mismatch. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence of the L protein of PBNV with other members of Bunyaviridae suggest that the L protein of PBNV is a viral polymerase. The L protein had highest identity in the 'core-polymerase domain' with the corresponding regions of other tospoviruses, tomato spotted wilt virus and impatiens necrotic spot virus.",

Membrane bound spherical virus particles (80-100 nm) encapsidate three species of RNA, small (S), medium (M) and large (L). Based on serological cross-reactivity and sequence homology of the nucleocapsid(N) protein, five serogroups have been recognized in the tospovirus genus. PBNV and the closely related watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMV) [33] represent serogroup IV and are antigenically distinct from other Tospoviruses: serogroup I=tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) [2] ; serogroup II=groundnut ring spot virus and tomato chlorotic spot virus [1] ; serogroup III=impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) [13] ; and, serogroup V=peanut yellow spot virus (PYSV) [26] .",

Further, we observe the presence of several defective L RNA (dL) species of both v and vc polarities in the nucleocapsids.

In initial studies, using RNA from purified PBNV nucleocapsids, we amplified parts of the genomic L RNA by RT-PCR with either v sense or vc sense primers. Specific PCR products were obtained with the sense primer, To demonstrate the v and vc sense forms of L RNA by northern analysis, strand specific digoxigenin labeled riboprobes were prepared from clone pb40 (Fig. 1) linearized with SmaI or XhoI prior to transcription with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase to generate v and vc sense transcripts, respectively. Blots shown in Fig. 2a showed both v (left panel) and vc (right panel) sense genomic length RNA (indicated by arrows). To confirm that the hybridizations were strand specific, an independent set of synthetic oligonucleotide probes were made to both v and vc sense strands. Two oligonucleotide primers, M-251and M-306 (Table 1) , were 3 end labeled and used as probes. The v and vc riboprobes and oligoprobes were equalized based on hybridization to respective PBNV cDNA clones. A similar pattern of hybridization observed with strand specific riboprobes was also observed with oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 2b , left panel, hybridization using v sense oligoprobe, 2b, right panel, hybridization using vc sense oligoprobe).",

These, smaller than genomic length RNAs indicated by arrow heads in Fig. 2a , 2b, probably represent defective species of the L RNA (dL) since they were not observed when hybridized with PBNV M RNA or S RNA specific probes (data not shown). Both v and vc forms of these RNAs were found in nucleocapsids. Defective RNAs have been reported for the M RNA of PBNV [24] and the L RNA of TSWV [20] , whereas defective RNAs specific for the S RNA have not been observed in tospoviruses. The dL RNAs of TSWV nucleocapsids, contain the 5 and 3 genomic termini with an internal deletion of 60-80% of the L RNA segment [21] . The dL RNAs observed in PBNV contained at least some of the middle portion of the L RNA since the strand specific riboprobes used in the northern analysis contained the core polymerase region. The presence of such dL RNAs suggests multiple deletions of internal sequences while maintaining portions or all of the 'core' region to create the observed defective RNAs. However, the precise nature of the dLRNAs observed in PBNV have not been confirmed since this can only be done by sequencing to map the junction sites. Several groups of RNA plant viruses possess defective RNAs which often interfere with the replication of the wild type virus and/or modulate the symptom expression [29] . The presence of the 5 and 3 RNA sequences and the maintenance of the ORF despite large internal deletions in TSWV [21] suggest that dL RNAs in tospoviruses interfere with replication by competing for the replication machinery and/or packaging of the wild type virus. The occurrence of the defective RNAs and the appearance of virus particles without the envelope resulted in the loss of transmission of PBNV by T. palmi (D. V. R. Reddy, pers. comm.).",

Since all genomic RNAs of tospoviruses contain conserved sequences at their termini, primers corresponding to the conserved sequences in the S and the M RNA of PBNV (Table 1) were combined with primers, M-256 and M-255 (Table 1) , to amplify the terminal sequences of the L RNA. In addition, clone pbM3 was obtained by RT-PCR using primers from the 5 sequence of pb21 (M-258) and the 3 sequence of pb40 (M-210) to fill the sequence gap between clones pb40 and pb21.

No other reading frame in v or vc sense contained ORFs of significant size. Thus the L RNA of PBNV appears to function as a negative sense RNA. The predicted size of the L protein was similar to those of TSWV (2 875 amino acids, 331 kDa) [3] and INSV (2 865 amino acids, 329 kDa) [31] . The predicted translation product of the PBNV L RNA appears to be the viral polymerase based on the similarities of sequence and size compared to the other tospovirus L proteins and the presence of conserved signature sequences in the 'core polymerase region' (GDX 1-3 K, GXXNXXS, SDD, FX 10-17 KK, EFXSXR) which are characteristic of the viral RNA polymerases of the negative stranded Orthmyxoviridae (influenza A virus) and Bunyaviridae (see below).",

            "text": "The putative viral polymerase of PBNV was compared with those of TSWV and INSV. The degree of conservation varied among the three tospoviruses. The highest level of identity was observed in the core polymerase region (60%) and the least identity occurred towards the ends of the protein (data not shown). Pairwise comparison of the L proteins of PBNV, INSV and TSWV using the GAP program of the Wisconsin GCG sequence analysis software package, indicated an overall identity of 45% (63.8% similarity) between PBNV and TSWV and 46% (65% similarity) between PBNV and INSV, while an identity of 69% (84% similarity) was observed between INSV and TSWV. These comparisons demonstrate that the L proteins of INSV and TSWV are more related to each other than to PBNV. The putative proteins encoded by S RNA and M RNA had similar patterns of relatedness between serogroups. For example, the N proteins were 55% identical between serogroups I and III [2, 13] and only 30-33% identical comparing TSWV and PBNV or INSV and PBNV [23] . In contrast, within serogroup IV (PBNV and WSMV) the relatedness of the N protein was much higher (> 80% identity) [33, 23] . The Clustering Phenogram of the L proteins of INSV, PBNV and TSWV constructed by progressive pair wise alignment with the PILEUP program of the GCG software package revealed that INSV clustered together with TSWV while PBNV represented a separate branch (data not shown). It is likely that PBNV and the closely related WSMV, both of which have been found only in the Asian subcontinent, have recently diverged.",

The two non-globular regions occupied amino acid residues 361-452 and 1 073-1 160. Non-globular elongated regions are common in large eukaryotic proteins where they are thought to serve as hinges connecting globular domains [32] . The three predicted globular regions in the L protein correspond to the three most conserved regions (regions 1, 2, and 3, [15] ). Region 1, located towards the amino terminus of the L protein (Fig. 3A) , contained two motifs conserved in tospo-, and selected bunya-and arenaviruses. The second globular region is nearly 700 amino acids downstream from region 1. Globular region 3 contains motifs A, B, C, and D that are also conserved in the L proteins of tospoviruses and bunyaviruses (Fig. 3B) . This globular region of the L protein contains a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain followed by another short conserved domain, which by a coiled-coil region might be involved in protein-protein interaction in vivo. Further, downstream in region 3, a long region moderately similar to the coiled-coil repeats in animal myosin was found (data not shown). Based on the superimposition on to the known threedimensional structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, motifs A, C, and D have been suggested to be directly involved in enzyme activity [15] .",
