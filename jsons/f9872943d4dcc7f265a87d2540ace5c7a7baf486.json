Recent efforts have expanded our knowledge of the true diversity of plant viruses by studying those viruses that infect wild, undomesticated plants. Those efforts have provided answers to basic ecological questions regarding viruses in the wild, and insights into evolutionary questions, regarding the origins of viruses. While much work has been done, we have merely scratched the surface of the diversity that is estimated to exist. In this chapter we discuss the state of our knowledge of virus diversity, both in agricultural systems as well as in native wild systems, the border between these two systems and how viruses adapt and move across this border into an artificial, domesticated environment. We look at how this diversity has affected our outlook on viruses as a whole, shifting our past view of viruses as purely antagonistic entities of destruction to one where viruses are in a mutually beneficial relationship with their hosts. Additionally, we discuss the current work that plant virology has put forth regarding the evolutionary mechanisms, the life histories, and the deep evolution of viruses.",

The variation we see within a single plant host has profound effects on the how the virus responds to selective pressures associated with new hosts, and factors such as the bottleneck events associated with cell-to-cell movement or vectoring. Additionally, with our ever increasing knowledge of the breadth of virus diversity, as well as advances in technology, questions of the deep evolutionary history of viruses and their relationship to their hosts are beginning to be answered.

            "text": "Agriculture is a human invention, and the cultivation of crops has propelled the human race to increasing cultural and technological advances, but with this advancement we have disturbed many natural systems throughout our history. Domestication of the earliest crops probably began about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago (Balter 2007) , presumably with their viruses experiencing a shift in selective pressure as well (Stukenbrock and McDonald 2008) . Densely spaced, monoculture crops have been increasingly favored due to the ease of production, but these conditions also are excellent for the spread and infection of viruses and other deleterious microbes within the crop (Thresh 1982; Power and Mitchell 2004) . To combat the yield loss associated with virus-induced disease, breeders have focused efforts on engineering disease resistant cultivars of crops. However, several forms of virus variation, such as the high mutation rates of RNA and some DNA viruses, recombination, and reassortment lead to resistance breaking (Duffy and Holmes 2008; McDonald and Linde 2002; Harrison 2002) . Although breeding of resistant cultivars has had some success, other methods such as increasing the plant species diversity in a given area, breaking the spatial and temporal components of the disease cycle, have been suggested (Ratnadass et al. 2012) . For example, genetic diversity (heterosis) induced tolerance to Turnip mosaic virus in wild cress (Lepidium sp.) hybrids, while plants that were selfed were more susceptable to disease, suggesting that small populations with low genetic diversity could lead to increased disease symptoms, and infection rates (Houliston et al. 2015) . Intercropping cowpea with cassava or plantains has reduced the incidence of viruses in Central America (Valverde et al. 1982) . These practices suggest that increases in plant diversity, either within a species or with diverse species, could lower the incidence or pathology of viruses (see Sect. 8.2.3) .",

Human movement of both the plants and vectors associated with pathogens has facilitated the spread of viruses. The effects of climate change in the form of CO 2 and ozone may change the impacts of viruses on their plant hosts (Trebicki et al. 2015) . While many pathogens move closer to the poles as climate change occurs, there is some evidence that viruses and nematodes are moving closer to the equator (Bebber et al. 2013) . This may be an analytical artifact as viral symptoms are often misdiagnosed.

Vector transmission mechanisms of plant viruses influence the effects the virus has on the plant host, with persistently transmitted viruses tending to either improve the host quality for the vector or mimic high quality, and nonpersistantly transmitted viruses lowering quality to facilitate the rapid dispersal of the viruliforous insect to neighboring plants (Mauck et al. 2012) . Host manipulation is seen in unrelated families of plant viruses, implying convergent evolution (Wu et al. 2014) . Barley yellow mosaic virus (BYDV) is persistently transmitted by the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Virus-free aphids have a feeding preference for BYDV-infected plants, while the reverse is true for BYDV-carrying aphids (Ingwell et al. 2012 ). Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a member of the Bromoviridae family, increases the release of volatiles that mimic healthy plants, attracting vectors despite the low quality of the plant for the aphids (Mauck et al. 2015b) . Additionally, CMV effects other non-vectoring insects, repelling some while attracting others, in the absence of aphids (Mauck et al. 2015a ). In mixed infections, competition can favor one microbe over another, as seen with the potyvirus, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) out-competing another potyvirus, Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). ZYMV and WMV are very similar viruses, in terms of genetics, hosts, and vectors. These similarities places them in direct competition with each other. One important difference is in vector manipulation; ZYMV manipulates the host-aphid relationship, while WMV does not. When co-infecting a plant, ZYMV will maintain its typical level of replication, while the replication of WMV is reduced. Despite this, WMV is still transmitted from a mixed infection, taking advantage of ZYMV host manipulation that attracts the aphid vectors (Salvaudon et al. 2013) . In an analysis of genetic turnover during transmission, several clones containing the same mutation leading to a premature stop codon was found within a plant. Further transmissions using this experimental isolate lost this mutation, but this suggests that ZYMV has the ability to complement defective ZYMV genomes in the aphid vector (Simmons et al. 2011) .",

We have already touched on the use of monoculture, and the effect of plant biodiversity on the diversity of viruses, in this section we look into how nearby systems can influence viruses. The intersection of wild and agricultural systems has been described as the agro-eco border (Roossinck and Garc\u00eda-Arenal 2015) . This border may be the source of new pathogenic plant viruses that can impact crops in spillover events ( Fig. 8 .1). In most cases these infections will be dead-end: either the virus is not competent for further transmission in the new host, it may not establish sufficient virus titer to allow transmission, or it may rapidly kill the host. Rarely, a spillover virus may develop the ability to be further transmitted to more similar hosts, resulting in an emerging virus infection Due to the relatively recent introduction of modern agriculture to Australia (in the past 200 years), considerable work has been done on this continent to look at the effect of agriculture across this border. Many of the native viruses in Australia have not been influence by agriculture. Three different new encounter events of legume-infecting potyviruses have been described in Australia. The interspecies genetic diversity of each virus differed, with the native viruses having greater diversity than the exotic viruses (Webster et al. 2007) .",

These viruses, that cause disease in crops, may be asymptomatic in other hosts. For example, Peanut stunt virus causes disease in peanuts, but is asymptomatic in clover (Sherwood 1997) . The presence of highly susceptible hosts in a plant community can increase the incidence of the virus across all susceptible species in the community (Power 2008) . Several scenarios can be seen where the spread of virus moves between an asymptomatic native host to cultivated plants (Jones 2014) . Emergent viral diseases may come from \"silent\" infections within a nearby wild population, and are driven by anthropogenic factors, such as food production or the introduction of vectors (Anderson et al. 2004 ). In Africa, there have been several emergent viruses in agricultural systems. While many changes in the pathogens themselves have promoted the emergence of disease, changes in agricultural practices have also promoted the introductions. Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV, in the genus Sobemovirus) infects Oryza sp. in both wild and agricultural systems. RYMV was first described in 1966 in Kenya and is currently an economically important plant virus. The rise of rice production in Kenya is thought to be the main driver of RYMV spread, as epidemics of the virus were not seen until after the intensification of rice production in the 1960s (Fargette et al. 2006 (Thresh 2006) .",

A lowered incidence of two begomoviruses was seen in wild peppers with decreasing levels of cultivation or management, suggesting a dilution effect with higher levels of biodiversity ). This correlation with biodiversity appears to hold true with CMV in wild plants, but not with CMV in crops (Sacrist\u00e1n et al. 2004 ). The loss of biodiversity appears to increase the movement of a virus across the agro-eco border, but a high degree of biodiversity can lead to a large number of viral species, which may serve as a reservoir for new infections (Keesing et al. 2010) . Opportunistic viruses quickly move into susceptible crops, decrease, then recover in the susceptible population, causing a rapid cycles of epidemics and decline (Harrison 1981; Thresh 1981) . In France, where ZYMV and WMV are both present, only WMV has significant natural reserviours, which explains the fragmented nature of ZYMV incidence across France (Lecoq et al. 2014) . In Spain, two strains of the potexvirus Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV-EU and PepMV-CH2) co-circulate among tomato crops, with the CH2 strain being the dominate strain. PepMV-EU primarily exists in coinfections with PepMV-CH2, and these coinfections allow for an extended host range of PepMV, thus extending the potential number of reservoirs. This has implications for coinfection effecting the emergence of PepMV in tomato plants (G\u00f3mez et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "Many wild plants host multiple viruses, in some cases up to seven different viruses were found co-existing in a single plant . In two studies in the United States and Costa Rica, over 50 % of the virus sequences found in wild plants belonged to three virus families: Partitiviridae, Chrysoviridae, and Totiviridae (Roossinck 2012b). These virus families, along with the Endornavirdae, have been described as persistent plant viruses (Roossinck 2010 (Roossinck , 2015a . Most of the persistent plant viruses are double stranded RNA viruses, although the Endornaviridae are likely single-stranded RNA viruses that are isolated as replicative intermediates (Roossinck et al. 2011) . Most interestingly, the persistent viruses are wholly transmitted vertically, with no known form of horizontal transmission. In fact, there is no cell-to-cell movement of persistent viruses, spreading throughout the host via cell division (Roossinck 2010 (Roossinck , 2012a . The Partitiviridae, Endornaviridae and Chrysoviridae infect both plants and fungi, while the Totiviridae also infect fungi and protozoa. While there is no observable effect of these viruses on their hosts, there have been multiple instances of integration of some persistent viral genomes into plant and fungal genomes (Liu et al. 2010; Chiba et al. 2011 ). This should not be surprising given the intimate symbiotic nature of the relationship. Currently the persistent viruses are understudied and many aspects of their nature are unknown (Roossinck 2015a) .",

Often, even when there are related viruses within a database, the curation is not in a state to be useful. There are few centralized databanks to store metadata collected during large biodiversity surveys, though attempts have been made. Metavir, a website service offering basic analysis of viromes, allows for viromes to be made public, and at the time of writing houses 368 different viromes from 67 different projects (Roux et al. 2014) . It is unclear how these potential viruses should be treated. In a recent virus survey in Costa Rica, 60 % of the sequence reads received no hit when searched against the GenBank database ). For viruses with no known relative, a cluster analysis can give structure to a population of unknown microbes, including viruses (Labont\u00e9 and Suttle 2013) .

The term quasispecies refers to a single replicating population, and is an \"individual\" that selection acts upon (Holland and Domingo 1998) . Do to the many different selective pressures an RNA virus experiences (different hosts, cell tropisms, vectors, etc.), a population that is more genetically robust, having a high degree of evolvability may have a selective advantage. This means in a fitness landscape, quasispecies that have a narrow fitness peak (less robust) experience a sharp decrease in fitness due to a single mutation, and are less likely to adapt rapidly to a new environment. Conversely, those with a wide fitness peak (more robust) will experience a small change in fitness, allowing for multiple mutations to accumulate for selection to act upon. This is known as the survival of the flattest (Wilke 2005) .",

However, in coronaviruses it is clear that error correction can occur (Denison et al. 2011 ). The quasispecies is effected by not only the mutation rate of the RdRp, but also by the mode of replication, logrithmic or stamping machine (Safari and Roossinck 2014) . While double-stranded RNA viruses replicate predominantly by the stamping machine method, the mode of replication of other RNA viruses is not clear. Although the mutation rate of RNA viruses are high, the level of variation within the quasispecies may be lower than expected (Garc\u00eda-Arenal et al. 2003) . This is due to both positive and negative selection; however, defective genomes are often carried in the population and can provide extended function in some cases. While there are significant genetic bottleneck during systemic infection (Li and Roossinck 2004) , as well as vector transmission (Ali and Roossinck 2010) , viruses probably recover their diversity rapidly.",

No tradeoff was found for becoming more of a generalist (Bedhomme et al. 2012; Elena et al. 2008) .

In the cucumoviruses experimental infections with interspecific reassortants have frequently led to recombinants in RNA 3, where the 3 0 end is exchanged with that of RNA 2, presumably to establish a minus strand promoter that is cognizant with the replicase (Aaziz and Tepfer 1999; deWispelaer et al. 2005; Pita and Roossinck 2013a) .

It was proposed three decades ago that animal and plant viruses have a common ancestor, likely an insect virus (Goldbach 1986) . Specific motifs in virus hallmark genes (genes which are unique to viruses and are found across many families of viruses) such as the RdRp were analyzed for similarity across a wide range of animal and plant RNA viruses, with positive, negative, and double-stranded genomes. Motifs in both the positive and double-stranded RNA viruses suggests that these groups are monophyletic, with the negative strand RNA viruses less likely to be monophyletic . Virus hallmark genes are shared with other selfish genetic elements, such as plasmids and transposons, suggesting that viruses have a deep lineage, which some suggest dates to a pre-cellular time (Koonin and Dolja 2014) . One can think of viruses as both an organism and a mobile genetic element, much as light can be thought of as both a particle and a wave. These entities evolve within their environment, and then move as genetic elements through higher organisms (Forterre and Prangishvili 2013) .

This suggests that the genetic histories of these genes are independent of each other (Pag\u00e1n and Holmes 2010) . Phylogenetic analysis of CMV genes implies that each of the viruses three RNA segments have unique histories (Roossinck 2002) . The extent of movement of genetic material across viruses can be seen with the recently named Amalgaviridae, a double-stranded RNA monopartite virus with 2 open reading frames, an RdRp and another gene. The RdRp most closely resembles that of another double-stranded RNA virus family, the Partitiviridae, while the other gene resembles that of the nucleoprotein of negative-stranded RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family . The iconic movement protein common and unique to plant viruses, may have been originally derived from the structural proteins used in the formation of the plasmodesmata (Lucas and Wolf 1993) .",

It is extremely difficult to extract preserved viral nucleic acid from more than a few decades ago, though it is possible (Roossinck, unpublished results) . Because of this difficulty, these rare integration events can be used to elucidate the life histories of the virus. Long before so many virus sequences were found in genomes, geminivirus sequences were found within the Nicotiana genome (Bejarano et al. 1996) . Begomoviruses have been described as being Old world or New world, with several distinct qualities associated with each group. Most notably, the New world begomoviruses are monopartite while the Old world are bipartite. Using the intergration events within Nicotiana, an estimate of 20-30 MYA was found for the Old/New world split, suggesting that this virus crossed the Beringian land bridge (Lefeuvre et al. 2011) . Cooperation of viruses in mixed infections may be the initial step towards multipartiate viruses. Two different monopartite viruses are known to cooperate, using each other's proteins for their own function. If the relationship of the two viruses becomes too dependent, essential gene loss can occur in one or both viruses that may remain viable due to the complementary gene of the other virus. This will eventually lead to merging the two species into a single species (Shirogane et al. 2013 ).",

Some ZYMV lineages have been shown to be no older than 800 years old, suggesting that humans had a role to play in there movement and diversification (Simmons et al. 2008) . Lueteoviridae diversification happened in three stages; The luteo/polerovirus split estimated at 2000 years ago, diversification of each genus estimated at 1000-5000 years ago, and the diversification of the species within the past 300 years (Pag\u00e1n and Holmes 2010) . The knowledge gained from extensive sampling including wild samples give us more insight into the life histories of viruses (Wylie et al. 2008) . Potyviruses have a large amount of diversity within and between their species. Yam mosaic virus (YMV) is thought to have been originated in Africa. High levels of recombination are found within natural populations of YMV (Bousalem et al. 2000) . The endogenization of Caulimoviruses distantly related to Rice tungro bacciliform virus into the rice genome have given us insight into the family's evolutionary history. The edongenization events occured before the divergence of the domestic rice progenitor Oryza rufipogon, placing this event at about 160,000 years ago (Chen et al. 2014 ).",

While the majority of viruses infecting crops cause disease, it appears that viruses in natural areas are neutral or may provide some small benefit to their hosts. This paradigm shift opens the door to many future applications, as well as exciting implications to the field of virology as a whole. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of movement across the agro-eco boundary, as well as an increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution, may provide us with methods of predicting future epidemics, or attenuating the outbreak of new crop pathogens. The modern era of genomics is revealing new and exciting areas of research into virus evolution, and studies on the origins of viruses will likely lead to an understanding of the very origins of life on earth.",
