Given the paucity of knowledge on ecosystem components, interactions and what drives their loss, we are usually aware of population and species declines and extinctions only after the fact, and often only after nothing can be done to meaningfully address or reverse the situation. For insects in particular, given the many knowledge shortfalls involved, the ever-increasingly important activity of insect conservation can seem overwhelming. This is also because it is hard to identify the main drivers of species declines in the various parts of the world, as well as the extent to which newly-discovered drivers are having an impact. Yet, it behoves researchers to do their best to raise alarms and find solutions at multiple places and scales, in a vast array of ecosystems, with a myriad of insects and their interactions, in all sorts of social contexts.",

These included the direct effects of 5G networks (Samways, 2020) and light pollution, and the indirect effects of CO2 increase (Aucott, 2020), human overpopulation and meat consumption. Some of these are common to all of biodiversity, while others are, if not exclusive, more prevalent for insects and other arthropods. Predictably, every single researcher found that the problem they were focusing on is one of, if not, the main driver of insect extinctions.",

The importance of each one depends on the spatial and temporal settings, with an overall solution for the entire world not being feasible or sensible. Extensive research programs with adequate funding are needed to comprehensively tackle the known unknowns, their importance, how they interact, and what are the most efficient solutions to deal with insect declines to avoid further population and species loss.",

Until recently, many of these issues were not an issue at all, as they either did not exist, or no one had looked at them. Among these, for example, is the microplastic contaminating aerial pathways to new environments and possibly affecting food chains (Al-Jaibachi et al., 2018). New threats are compounding old threats at a pace with which we are not able to keep up. It is difficult enough to research and act upon what we are aware of, but to create warning systems for invisible or future threats might be impossible. Only by extensively monitoring populations and looking at changes that cannot be explained by studied threats, might we be able to suspect what new adverse factors threaten natural ecosystems, so that we might act positively on them.",

Over recent decades, new diseases, from HIV to SARS and Covid-19, crossed animal species borders and have infected humans.
