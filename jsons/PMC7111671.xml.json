The virus replicates primarily in enterocytes of the small intestine causing villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhea which lead to electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis and death (Alvarez et al., 2015, Annamalai et al., 2015). The characteristic clinical signs of PEDV infection are watery diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and dehydration which are followed by high mortality rates (50\u2013100%) in suckling piglets or weight loss due to diarrhea in older pigs (Pensaert and Martelli, 2016).",

It is organized in a central coding region that is flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs). The first gene ORF1ab encompasses approximately 2/3 of the viral genome and encodes large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b), that are cleaved by viral encoded proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) (Huang et al., 2013). In addition, four structural proteins are encoded by ORFs2, \u22124, \u22125 and \u22126, including the S glycoprotein (180\u2013220 kDa), membrane (M; 27\u201332 kDa), envelope (E; 7 kDa), and the nucleocapsid proteins (N; 55\u201358 kDa), respectively.

The S protein is expressed as a 1386 amino acid (aa) precursor protein (180\u2013200 kDa) that is cleaved by host proteases into two major subunits: the S1 subunit (residues 20\u2013729) that mediates virus attachment to the cell surface receptor; and the S2 subunit (residues 730\u20131386) involved in virus and host cell membrane fusion. Like other coronavirus\u2019 S proteins, the PEDV S is a type I membrane glycoprotein that forms homotrimeric projections (spikes) on the virion surface and contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1\u201318), a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain (residues 1328\u20131350) and a short cytoplasmic tail (residues 1351\u20131386) (Li et al., 2016). The S1 subunit has been shown to have a modular architecture with four discrete domains, including an N-terminal domain (NTD; residues 19\u2013233) that exhibits sialic acid binding activity and a C-terminal domain (CTD; residues 477\u2013629) that can interact with protein receptor(s) (Li et al., 2016). The S2 subunit presents the typical structural features found in class I fusion proteins, including a hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP, residues 891\u2013908), two heptad repeat regions (HR1, residues 978\u20131117 and HR2, residues 1274\u20131313), and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1328\u20131350) (aa positions based on PEDV strain CO13 S sequence, GenBank accession no. KF272920) (Li et al., 2016). The homotrimeric S proteins on the virion surface are uncleaved and undergo proteolytic processing required for fusion during entry (Shirato et al., 2011, Wicht et al., 2014).",

Most importantly, at least four neutralizing domains have been identified in the S protein, including: 1) a domain recently mapped to the NTD/S0 region (Li et al., 2017), 2) a domain that is homologous to the collagenase resistant fragment (CO-26K) of TGEV S (Godet et al., 1994), thus being named \u201ccollagenase equivalent\u201d (COE) in PEDV (residues 499\u2013638) (Chang et al., 2002), 3) an epitope that has been mapped to the S1D region (residues 636\u2013789) and spans the S1-S2 junction region (Sun et al., 2008), and 4) an epitope mapped to C-terminus of the S protein (residues 1371\u20131377) (Cruz et al., 2008).",

The reactivity of select (n=11) mAbs was assessed by IFA against the prototype PEDV strain USA/Colorado/2013 (Marthaler et al., 2013) and the S-INDEL strain USA/Iowa106/2013 (Oka et al., 2014) (Fig. 1). Additionally, their neutralizing activity was assessed by fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) assay, with supernatants from nine hybridomas presenting neutralizing titers between 4 and 16 (data not shown). These hybridoma lines were subcloned by limiting dilution (10\u22121 to 10\u201312) and further characterized in our study. One additional hybridoma cell line (SD33-1; Fig. 1) secreting S-specific mAbs that did not neutralize PEDV and another line previously established at the SD Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (SD37-11) (unpublished data) were also included in our study. Following subcloning one-to-two clones of each primary hybridoma line was selected and subjected to ascites production (Envigo, Inc.). A summary of the properties and characteristics of the mAbs generated here is presented in\nTable 1.",

As shown in Fig. 5C eight mAbs recognized epitope 744\u2013759 (SD37-11, SD121-1, SD129-3, SD129-5, SD-131-3, SD137-90, SD138-108, and SD142-2), while only two MAbs recognized epitope 756\u2013771 (SD120-5 and SD129-5). A summary of the epitope specificity of individual mAbs is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 6. Notably, two mAbs specific to the S1-S2 region (SD37-11 and SD121-1) recognized only epitope 744\u2013759, four mAbs (SD131-3, SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2) recognized both epitopes 744\u2013759 and 747\u2013774, while two mAbs (SD120-1 and SD129-5) recognized epitopes 756\u2013771 and 747\u2013774 (Fig. 6; Table 2). These results indicate that the amino terminus of the S2 subunit protein contains highly antigenic, perhaps, immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of PEDV, and further suggest that epitope 744\u2013759 may represent a core neutralizing epitope within S1-S2 junction region (Fig. 6).",

            "text": "Given its critical functions in cell entry, the coronavirus S protein is the main target of host humoral responses. Neutralizing antibodies directed against the S protein likely play a key role on protection against PEDV infection. A recent study demonstrated that neutralizing activity against PEDV in colostrum and milk correlated with levels of IgA antibodies to the S protein (S1 and S2 subunits) (Song et al., 2016). Notably, at least four neutralizing regions have been identified in the S protein (Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2006; Cruz et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2007). Recently, a neutralizing domain was identified in the NTD/S0 region of the S1 subunit (Li et al., 2017), with other epitope(s) mapping to a domain in S1 that is homologous to the collagenase resistant fragment (CO-26 K) of TGEV S (Godet et al., 1994) (aa 499\u2013638; named \u201ccollagenase equivalent\u201d in PEDV, COE) (Chang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2017). A region spanning the S1-S2 junction (aa 638\u2013789) in PEDV S contains other neutralizing epitope(s) (Sun et al., 2007), with a well defined neutralizing epitope mapping to the carboxy-terminus of the S protein (aa 1371\u20131377) (Cruz et al., 2006, Cruz et al., 2008). Results here showing the specificity of ten PEDV neutralizing mAbs for these domains in the S protein confirm that epitopes located in these regions are indeed responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies against PEDV. The fact that these mAbs were generated by immunization of mice with whole virus preparations indicates that these regions are highly antigenic, further suggesting that epitopes within these regions may represent immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of the PEDV S protein.",

            "text": "While the amino-terminal region of S (S1, aa 1\u2013729) is involved in virus attachment to cellular receptors, the carboxy-terminal region (S2, aa 730\u20131383) undergoes conformational changes after the attachment of S1 to facilitate fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane, thus allowing entry of the viral genome into the host cell (Li et al., 2016). Notably, antibodies directed against both S subunits have been correlated with neutralization of PEDV infectivity (Song et al., 2016). Immunization of mice with inactivated whole PEDV virion preparations followed by somatic cell fusion here resulted in production of hybridoma cell lines secreting mAbs specific for the PEDV S protein and capable of neutralizing the virus infectivity in vitro (titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:640). Interestingly, epitope mapping ELISAs revealed that most mAbs developed here (ten of eleven) specifically recognized epitopes located within the S2 subunit (SD37-11, SD120-1, SD121-1, SD125-2, SD129-3, SD129-5, SD131-3 SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2), while only one mAb (SD131-3) reacted with the S1 subunit (Fig. 3C and D). While UV- or formalin inactivated PEDV virions likely do not retain the exact antigen conformation and architecture of infective PEDV particles, the data here suggest that the S2 subunit contains immunodominant antigenic determinants of PEDV. Results from a recent study showing higher levels of S2-specific IgG antibodies when compared to S1-specific antibodies in serum and colostrum of sows naturally infected with PEDV, further support this hypothesis (Song et al., 2016). Nevertheless, antibodies against the S1 subunit also play a critical role on immune responses against PEDV (Song et al., 2016), and immunization with the recombinant S1 protein subunit have induced neutralizing antibodies and passive protection against infection (Oh et al., 2014). Similar experiments, however, have to be performed with the S2 subunit to assess its immunogenicity and to determine the contribution of S2-specific antibodies on protection against PEDV.",

            "text": "Infection with PEDV induces neutralizing antibody responses within 14\u201321 days post-infection, with NA titers in convalescent polyclonal serum usually ranging between 1:20 to 1:320 (Chen et al., 2016; Clement et al., 2016). As shown in Fig. 3, most S-specific mAbs produced here (exception SD33-1) were capable of completely blocking PEDV infectivity (titers of 1:40 to 1:640), with a few of these mAbs (SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2) presenting markedly higher neutralizing activity (titers up to 1:640) (Table 2). Considering the highly stringent endpoint criteria used in the in vitro neutralization assays (90% reduction in fluorescent focus-forming units or 80% reduction in plaque forming-units), and the fact that these are monospecific antibodies these titers represent potent neutralizing activities. It is important to note, that while mAbs SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2 specifically recognized two overlapping epitopes located in the amino-terminus of the S2 subunit (aa 744\u2013759 and 747\u2013774), they did not react against epitope 756\u2013771, which is also contained within the neutralizing epitope aa 747\u2013774 in S2. Together these results indicate that these mAbs either recognize epitope 744\u2013759 or, perhaps, a smaller epitope within this region. These observations suggest that epitope 744\u2013759 might represent a core immunodominant neutralizing epitope of PEDV S. However, the possibility that these results reflect a higher avidity and/or affinity of these specific mAbs for their target epitope cannot be formally excluded.",

The S-INDEL variant strains contain aa insertions, deletions and/or substitutions mainly in the N-terminus of the S1 protein subunit (first 350 aa). Although a recent study has shown that there is significant serological and neutralizing cross-reactivity between two representative strains obtained in the US (Chen et al., 2016), significant antigenic differences have been demonstrated between PEDV strains by using mAbs against the S1 protein subunit (Li et al., 2017). Here we showed that ten of eleven mAbs recognized both prototype (CO13) and S-INDEL (Iowa106) strains in IFA and/or whole virus ELISAs (Figs. 1 and 3A and B), while only one mAb (SD125-2) did not react with S-INDEL infected cells. Most importantly, all mAbs that recognized prototype or US-INDEL infected cells also presented neutralizing activity against both PEDV strains. These results are consistent with the fact that the target neutralizing epitopes of these mAbs (744\u2013759, 747\u2013774 or 756\u2013771) are highly conserved (100% aa id; data not shown) between the two PEDV strains used in our study. The reactivity and neutralizing activity of these mAbs with other more diverse S-INDEL strains, however, may vary and awaits further experimentation.",

Given that most neutralizing mAbs developed here are specific for epitopes located within the S1-S2 junction region, we performed endpoint ELISA titrations with these mAbs using the recombinant S1-S2 protein (aa 630\u2013800) and assessed the correlation between ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers. Notably, a strong positive correlation between the ELISA titers and FFN titers was observed for all mAbs developed here. Similarly, neutralizing antibody titers detected on a convalescent swine serum sample used as positive control also matched the endpoint titers detected in the S1-S2 ELISA. These observations indicate the importance of the S protein as the major target of neutralizing antibody responses against PEDV, and highlight the S1-S2 junction as an immunodominant region with strong neutralizing activity within the S protein.",

Optimal assay conditions, including the amount of peptide, and secondary antibody dilution were determined by a checkerboard titration and conditions that resulted in the highest signal to noise ratio were used. Nunc\u2122 Immbolizer\u00ae amino plates (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were coated with individual peptides (744\u2013759, 80 ng/well; 756\u2013771, 133 ng/well; 747\u2013771, 200 ng/well and 1371\u20131377, 400 ng/well) in bicarbonate/carbonate coating buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate, 35 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) in alternate wells. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next, plate were washed four times with PBS tween 20 (PBS-T, 0.05%) and blocked 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with PBS-T 2% non-fat dry milk. Blocking reagent was removed and plates washed three times with PBS-T (300 \u00b5l). mAb incubations and reaction development were performed as above. OD values for each test and control samples were normalized to the OD value of uncoated wells and results expressed as OD values.",
