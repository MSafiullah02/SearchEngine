It has generally been considered a bacterial disease, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and/or Moraxella catarrhalis as the major causes. Therefore, the disease has generally been treated with antibiotic, making AOM the leading cause of antibiotic prescription in the United States and contributing to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

Although bacterial pathogens have been isolated in the majority of cases, cultures have still yielded negative results for pathogenic bacteria in \u223c12%\u201335% of cases [1]. Studies using more-sensitive culture techniques and PCR have shown increasing bacterial yield [2, 3]. Although Mycoplasma and Chlamydia species have been detected infrequently [4\u20136], presence of respiratory viruses in MEF samples obtained from children with AOM has become evident with the more-sensitive detection techniques used [7\u20139]. Even with the effort to identify more viruses in MEF in recent studies, 15%\u201325% of MEF samples still contain no identifiable pathogen. The major reasons for failure in detection of pathogens in MEF have been limited volume of MEF and limited availability of sensitive detection methods for a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, especially viruses.",

Attempts were made to detect a broad range of bacteria and viruses known to be associated with respiratory infections and/or AOM. Bacterial detection methods included routine culture, multiplex PCR (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, and Alloiococcus otitidis), and broad-range PCR. Viral detection methods included viral culture, viral antigen detection (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, and parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133), and PCR (rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus 229E and OC-40). In addition, PCR was performed on selected samples for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, coronavirus NL63, and human bocavirus, a newly recognized respiratory virus in the Parvoviridae family. The results showed bacteria and/or viruses in 96% of cases and both bacteria and viruses together in 66% of cases.",

            "text": "A few aspects of this study deserve particular consideration. First, the study population did not have intact tympanic membranes. However, otorrhea appeared acutely <48 h before study entry, implicating AOM in children with indwelling tympanostomy tubes; it is reasonable to assume that the microbiology of AOM in children with intact tympanic membranes would be similar. Second, bacterial and/or viral nucleic acids, as opposed to live bacteria and/or viruses, were detected in MEF specimens in this study. There has been ample evidence of live bacteria and viruses in MEF, and animal models have shown the ability of either bacteria, viruses, or combined bacteria and viruses to induce AOM [9, 11\u201313]. Last, results of virus typing showed a relatively high detection of picornaviruses (41% overall, with 20% rhinovirus, 11% nontypeable picornavirus, and 10% enterovirus) and relatively low detection of respiratory syncytial virus (14%). This may be explained by the following: the age of the children (median age, 21 months) is older than the peak age incidence of AOM (6\u201318 months); the study may have been performed during a low-activity respiratory syncytial virus season; and varying sensitivity of PCR assays for each virus may also affect the detection rate of various viruses. Additional studies with a larger number of children at the peak age incidence of AOM are needed to compare the relative importance of each respiratory virus in AOM.",

However, in the majority of cases when AOM is not a \u201cpure\u201d bacterial disease, response to antibiotic treatment can only be partial. Indeed, results of antibiotic treatment for AOM have varied from very effective to indifferent. Failure of antibiotic treatment in some cases of AOM could be attributed to such factors as inappropriate antibiotic, resistant bacteria, or biofilm formation [14]. Nevertheless, viruses are not the \u201cinnocent bystanders\u201d in the middle ear. In AOM cases for which both bacteria and viruses were detected in the MEF, results of antibiotic treatment were impaired compared with results of treatment of AOM associated with bacteria alone [13, 15]. Studies have shown that viruses have contributed to poor treatment outcome by increasing middle ear inflammation (as evidenced by increased levels of inflammatory mediators) [16, 17], decreasing neutrophil function [18], and decreasing antibiotic penetration into the middle ear [19].",

Recent trends of treatment of AOM have relied less on antibiotic, because many patients with AOM recover spontaneously without antibiotic treatment. This has led to the recent recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians to withhold antibiotic treatment in mild and selected AOM cases [20]. For severe AOM cases for which antibiotic is indicated, viral coinfection could lead to clinical failure even when appropriate antibiotic has sterilized the MEF. When one keeps in mind the possibility of combined bacterial and viral infections in AOM, expectations for antibiotic treatment of AOM will be more realistic, and a failed course of antibiotic treatment may not be promptly blamed on antibiotic-resistant bacteria, leading to continuous changes in antibiotic regimens. Watchful waiting after a treatment course may also become an alternative. Because antiviral drugs are not available to treat upper respiratory tract infection (except for influenza) in children, and because viral diagnosis is not generally performed, the use of antiviral drugs cannot be recommended for treatment of AOM at this time.",

Viruses impair host defense, including neutrophil function, and create the milieu to promote infection of the respiratory tract by pathogenic bacteria, which mainly colonize the nasopharynx. Increased bacterial attachment to epithelial cells and increased colonization of bacteria have been shown to result from viral infection [21\u201323]. Similar to AOM, it is possible that the virus can also enter sites such as paranasal sinuses and lungs, causing combined bacterial and viral infection. Effects of antibiotic treatment in \u201cpure\u201d bacterial versus combined bacterial and viral sinusitis and pneumonia deserve further study.",
