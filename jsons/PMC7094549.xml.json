This statistically significant and clinically important relationship has never previously been demonstrated.

A severe weather warning for icy roads is likely to also indicate icy pavements. We report a significant increase in the number of walking wounded, predominantly resulting from low energy slips and falls rather than high energy road traffic accidents. This highlights the importance of ensuring pavements are clear of ice, in addition to roads, during periods of extreme weather.",

However, the relatively short study period may preclude generalisability, and other possible confounders contributing to fracture burden such as an increase in steroid use in COPD sufferers were not explored.
