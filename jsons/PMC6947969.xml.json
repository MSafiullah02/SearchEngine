In humans, malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, of which Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the major contributors to human morbidity and mortality. An effective malaria vaccine would reduce deaths and could accelerate the systematic elimination of malaria. As a result, investigators worldwide have sought to develop malaria vaccines that either block infection altogether, block transmission, or control infection loads at the blood stage [2].",

Because these vaccines would target the sporozoite or liver stages, they are commonly referred to as \u201cpre-erythrocytic\u201d or \u201cpre-red blood cell\u201d (pre-RBC) vaccines. For the past several decades investigators have focused on pre-erythrocytic vaccines because of the radiation-attenuated sporozoite (RAS) paradigm [4\u201310]. Inoculation of RAS into humans by either mosquito bite or intravenous delivery protects humans from re-challenge with non-irradiated sporozoites [5, 9, 10]. This long-standing experimental vaccine paradigm suggests that it is possible to design a pre-erythrocyte vaccine that will provide complete sterile protection from malaria infection.",

Priming of antigen-specific effector T-cells by RAS in human and mouse infection models plateaus after the first immunization, [7, 15] suggesting that subsequent homologous RAS boost provides only minor gains in parasite-targeting T cell populations. RAS stimulates CD8+ T cells against liver stages by presenting pre-erythrocyte antigens through MHC Class I molecules on hepatocytes. After RAS sporozoites invade hepatocytes, parasite development stalls [16] resulting in degradation of a heterogeneous population of malaria pre-erythrocyte stage proteins. These are subjected to proteosomal degradation, and peptide cleavage products are subsequently loaded onto MHC class I molecules and presented on the hepatocyte surface. These degraded proteins undergo processing that is poorly understood, although preference for presentation via MHC Class I appears to favor parasite antigens containing a PEXEL domain [17].",

Identification of malaria proteoforms from liver stages would define putative antigens that induce the protective immunity afforded by RAS. Past studies by Tarun and Kappe successfully identified liver stage tryptic peptides from Plasmodium yoelii by enriching for fluorescently-labelled parasites [18]. More recently, Sinnis and colleagues characterized P. berghei merosome proteins released from HepG2 cells [19]. Discovery of the presented malaria liver stage antigens has remained elusive because malaria is a complex organism expressing > 5000 gene products [20], all of which can ultimately code for multiple different polypeptide species (proteoforms).",

Second, the segregation of the parasite vacuolar membrane from the host cytoplasm creates a barrier between the malaria proteoforms and host proteases. Hence the degree at which malaria proteoforms are digested and presented relative to host proteoforms has remained uncharacterized.",

Given past reports from human and animal models of live sporozoite challenge, it is clear that attenuated sporozoites can induce a population of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells targeting liver stage antigens [7]. The generation of these T cell populations has formed the basis for a model in which hepatocytes present malaria antigens on MHC class I. Also possible, but largely unexplored, is the idea that developing schizont proteoforms are digested by host or parasite proteases in a manner that does not resemble MHC Class I peptides (Fig. 1). These non-MHC Class I proteoforms could exist as random fragments with no potential for interaction with histocompatibility receptors or these fragments could be on-path for additional digestion and subsequent MHC Class I presentation (Fig. 1).\n",

Primary human hepatocytes were transplanted into FNRG mice which after several weeks became highly engrafted as seen by ~ 1 \u00d7 104 \u00b5g/mL human albumin level in the serum of transplanted animals (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The chimeric FNRG mice were subsequently injected with P. falciparum NF54 sporozoites to form liver stage parasites. PHHs were inoculated with P. falciparum NF54 sporozoites and subsequently stained at different time points with anti-P. falciparum-HSP70 antibodies. Seventy-two hours after sporozoite inoculation of PHHs, parasite schizonts were apparent and smaller than the hepatocyte nucleus (Fig. 2a). Eight days later the parasite schizonts exceeded the size of the hepatocyte nucleus, but merozoite formation was disorganized and the overall growth of the in vitro schizont was stunted (Fig. 2b). In contrast, infected hepatocytes from human liver chimeric mice inoculated with P. falciparum NF54 sporozoites via tail vein injection and stained with anti-P. falciparum-CSP had large, organized schizonts filled with merozoites that dwarfed the size of the hepatocyte nucleus 7 days after inoculation (Fig. 2c). The size of schizonts in human liver chimeric FNRG mice and PHH cultures were quantified (Fig. 3a). Schizonts from engrafted FNRG mouse livers were statistically larger (p = 0.0002) ranging from 260 to 385 nm2, while schizonts from PHH mono-cultures were 162 nm2 to 212 nm2 in size. In addition, there were statistically more numerous merozoites (p < 0.0001) per schizont in FNRG humanized mice ranging from 20 to 50 versus 5 to 18 in PHH mono-cultures (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that while the in vitro PHH model supports schizont development during the first few days after sporozoite inoculation, the chimeric humanized mouse liver model is a more supportive conduit for late liver stage development. This could be due to the fact that the latter human hepatocytes have a transcriptional profile more similar to what is observed in the human liver because they are in the three-dimensional context of the murine liver.\n\n",

Conserved proteins from infected chimeric mouse livers, (representing those that were sequenced in two or more samples), numbered 1930 (36% of total) among host proteins (Fig. 5a) and 20 (10.5% of total) among P. falciparum proteins (Fig. 5b). Among infected primary human hepatocytes, a total of 1339 total Human proteins (Fig. 5c), 39 total P. falciparum proteins (Fig. 5d), 573 (42% of total) conserved Human proteins (Fig. 5c), and two (5% of total) conserved P. falciparum proteins were identified across biological replicates (Fig. 5d). The four proteins identified among all infected humanized mouse livers were W7KN90 (an uncharacterized protein), W7K8P5 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit), W7JYB7 (Actin-2), and W7K9G1 (DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit A) (Table 1). Among infected primary human hepatocyte samples a single protein (W7K7Q9), encoding an uncharacterized protein, was sequenced in all three biological replicates (Table 2).\n\n\n",

Specifically, the parasite tubovesicular network can sequester host factors that damage the PVM [37].

In this study, mass spectrometry was used to identify host and malaria proteoforms from liver stages. Because an enrichment mechanism is lacking to specifically harvest schizont-containing hepatocytes, samples in this study likely contained uninfected cells, infected cells with aborted development, and infected hepatocytes with vegetative schizonts. Hence proteoforms sequenced in these studies could be derived from intact or aborted schizonts. Additionally, experiments using chimeric mouse livers that were frozen, thawed, and homogenized could generate degraded proteoforms that reflect degradation during sample preparation rather than parasite metabolic activity. Currently, these two forms cannot be distinguished.",

Thus, a majority of hepatocytes inoculated with sporozoites do not mount productive infections. MudPIT sequencing from infected hepatocytes resulted in the identification of both Human and P. falciparum proteins at a ratio of 34:1 (Human: P. falciparum). The P. falciparum species represent approximately 2.9% of the total protein population. Given that so few hepatocytes are infected with mature schizonts after 96 h (post-sporozoite inoculation), this result is surprising in that one might expect the ratio to be nearly 1000:1 (Human: P. falciparum proteins). Additionally, each schizont represents only a portion of the total hepatocyte mass. However, there are at least two likely reasons for this result. First, the initial parasite to hepatocyte ratio is 1:2 (during inoculation). In theory, a perfect infection, where each sporozoite gave rise to one schizont would result in 50% of hepatocytes harbouring schizonts. Inoculation only results in 0.1\u20130.2% of cells containing schizonts [26]. Hence, a majority of parasites must invade hepatocytes and then subsequently abort their development between 0 and 96 h post-inoculation. Proteins from sporozoites that fail to develop in hepatocytes are most likely degraded. Therefore, P. falciparum proteoform identifications from this study are likely derived from both mature schizonts and sporozoites that failed to develop. A second reason for observing an unexpectedly high number of P. falciparum peptides from these hepatocytes is mostly technical. During these experiments, the mass spectrometer isolates and fragments the most abundant peptides. After the first round of peptide isolation and fragmentation, the instrument selects for a lower abundance ion and continues to select for progressively lower abundance ions in a mode known as dynamic exclusion. Importantly, because the instrument in these studies employed dynamic exclusion mode, the number of P. falciparum proteoform identifications was enhanced.",

For example, the development of Tribrid instruments, containing three mass analysers in tandem are capable of identifying more spectra and are compatible with gas-phase separation techniques (such as high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry) (FAIMS). From a complex mixture of polypeptides, FAIMS can select proteoforms of interest that have specific size, charge, or shape characteristics [39\u201341]. This study and others that aim to isolate small polypeptides (similar in size to MHC Class I), often perform biochemical (often separation by MW) fractionation prior to mass spectrometry analysis [42\u201344]. During fractionation much of the low molecular weight polypeptides are lost. In future experiments utilization of FAIMS could circumvent the need for size separation prior to mass spectrometry and instead use gas-phase fractionation to sequence malaria and self-peptides from liver stages. This experimental modification should increase the number and depth of proteoforms identified from malaria liver stages by reducing sample loss experienced during off-line size fractionation and selecting for smaller proteoforms using the FAIMS device.",

For example, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is highly expressed in sporozoites and early liver stages, induces antibodies [3, 30, 45\u201349], induces immunodominant CD8+ T cells that confer protective immunity in na\u00efve mice [50], and protects humans from experimental malaria challenge [51]. Despite the strong expression and assumed MHC Class I presentation of CSP at liver stages, this study failed to detect these antigens as dominantly presented peptides. That MHC Class I restricted peptides from CSP are presented to CD8+ T cells during the course of malaria infection suggests that our approach has limitations in sensitivity. Additionally, P. falciparum CSP contains a repeating amino acid pattern of NANPN that accounts for 40% of the predicted protein sequence. Fragment ions from cleavage adjacent to proline ions dominate tandem mass spectra. The dominance of proline within CSP fragments could reduce the number of fragment ion matches resulting in a failure to match CSP spectra to the P. falciparum proteome. As a second possibility, malaria liver stage samples for these studies were taken at timepoints \u2265 96 h after sporozoite inoculation, where CSP expression could wane as the parasite transitions to late liver stages.",

Consistent with the recent characterization of P. berghei merosomes by Shears et al. [19], MSP7-like and MSP-8 proteoforms were observed in mature liver stage forms isolated from humanized mouse samples but not monoculture samples (Additional file 3: Table S2). These results support our observation that chimeric humanized mice support development of mature liver stages. The truncated schizont development observed in the monoculture system suggests that it should be considered for use in future studies aiming to characterize early liver stages whereas the chimeric humanized mouse model shows potential to be useful for analysis of early and late liver stages.",

Currently, approaches to prime and boost with sporozoites results in a plateau of T cell populations targeting parasites [7, 15]. Priming with a diverse population of genetically attenuated sporozoites followed by boost with an orthogonal immunization mechanism might enhance the breadth and depth of protection beyond what has been achieved in past human malaria challenge trials. Here, an approach was described to identify liver stage proteoforms from in vivo and in vitro parasite culture systems. These experiments provide an experimental proof-of-concept to identify liver stage antigens that serve as orthogonal immunization targets following attenuated sporozoite inoculation.",
