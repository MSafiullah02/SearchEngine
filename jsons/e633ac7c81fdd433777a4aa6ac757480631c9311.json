(which was not certified by peer review) Introduction COVID-19 was first confirmed in Wuhan, Hubei province in December 2019, and has rapidly become a global disease of epic scale in less than two months. As of to date, this pandemic has still not been well controlled, [1, 2, 3] Similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, apart from respiratory manifestations, a proportion of COVID-19 patients also develop GI symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting. [4, 5] Several retrospective studies have described the clinical symptoms, epidemiologic characteristics, and outcomes of the patients with GI symptoms, but these have mainly focused on the adult population. [6, 7, 8, 9] It is still not known whether children with COVID-19 have similar or different GI features as adults.",

[6, 7, 9] The reason for the higher rate of GI symptoms in children may be the difficulty in maintaining good hand hygiene in children who are more likely to touch their lips and mouth than adults. Supporting this, we found that infants (younger than two years old) were more likely to present with GI symptoms than older children.",

[17] A study focusing on GI symptoms in COVID-19 adults noted that GI cases had a significantly higher rate of fever and a higher tendency to have a more severe disease. [6] In the current study for children, the results further support the association with fever, but not in terms of severity. The difference may be due to a small sample size in children and the extremely low incidence of severe COVID-19 cases in children, which was only 1.65% in this cohort. The presence of GI symptoms in children did not translate to significantly longer length of stay.",

Whether it is related to the change of viral virulence or isolation policy remains to be further explored. Another observation is that most of the children were infected via family contact rather than community acquired. [16] In our cohort, 203 (83.1%) of 244 patients were infected by their parents or grandparents. As the epidemic progressed in Wuhan, diagnostic tests became more readily available leading to earlier disease detection through contact screening of family members before they became symptomatic. This observation could be useful for public health planning in countries still experiencing the early stage of the pandemic.",
