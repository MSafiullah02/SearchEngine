To check the adequacy of the mathematical model, the simulation results were compared with the spread of coronavirus in China, in a number of European and Asian countries, and the United States. The parameters of the logistics equation for Russia, Moscow and other large regions were determined in the interval [01.03 -08.04]. A comparative analysis of growth rates of COVID-19 infected population for different countries and regions is presented. Various scenarios of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Moscow and in the regions of Russia are considered. For each scenario, curves for the daily new cases and graphs for the increase in the total number of cases were obtained, and the dynamics of infection spread by day was studied. Peak times, epidemic periods, the number of infected people at the peak and their growth were determined.",

Although this parameter represents the maximum number of residents who can potentially be infected, it does not mean that all of them will get sick. In this model, as much as corresponds to the growth indicator \u03b1 will get sick in contrast to SI, SIR, and other models. The normalizing factor N depends on the nation's immunity to the virus, on the living conditions of the inhabitants (crowding, etc.), on the mentality of the nation, etc. It is calculated based on the agreement of calculated and actual data. Table 2 The parameter values have not been re-selected or changed since April 7. All scenarios up to April 7 described the actual data well, but by April 14 it became clear that the 3 rd and 4 th scenarios were lagging behind the actual data, especially the 4-th scenario with N = 3\u00d710 5 . Splitting of forecast data under four scenarios begins as the number of cases increases and approaches the peak (see Fig. 3, 4) . Table 5 suggests optimism that the second scenario of the epidemic will be held. But there is a chance that Moscow will follow the worst-case first scenario. Table 5 shows that scenarios 3 and 4 produce results that lag more and more behind the actual data every day. So, it was not possible to keep the milder scenarios of the epidemic development with a smaller number of cases. In recent days, the results of scenarios 1 and 2 have also started to lag behind the real data. It seems that the easing of already soft restrictive measures has led to an outbreak in some regions. This means that the growth rate parameter \u03b1 has changed, and it will need to be slightly increased and selected in the model. Which of the scenarios, the harder 1 st scenario or the less hard 2 nd scenario, is implemented will be clear in a few days.",

To model the epidemic in a number of European countries, such as Italy and Spain, we needed two logistic equations with different rationing factors. This is due to fluctuations with a large amplitude in the peak area and on a downtrend. The results of the logistics equation with a smaller multiplier described the actual data better before the peak. The model with a larger multiplier described the real data better after the peak.

The model was used to describe the dynamics of the spread and forecast of COVID-19 coronavirus infection in various countries and cities: Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Sweden, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and others. For each country, different model parameters were selected at the early stages of the spread of the epidemic and several scenarios for its further development were proposed. All scenarios described the actual data well at the beginning of the epidemic and produced very similar results. But as the extent of the epidemic increases, when the influence of the normalizing factor N begins to affect, the forecast scenarios for the development of the epidemic begin to differ greatly.
