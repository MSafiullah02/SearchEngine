The availability of accurate and robust epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data early in an epidemic is important to guide public health decision-making.1 Consistent recording of epidemiological information is important to understand transmissibility, risk of geographic spread, routes of transmission, and risk factors for infection, and to provide the baseline for epidemiological modelling that can inform planning of response and containment efforts to reduce the burden of disease. Furthermore, detailed information provided in real time is crucial for deciding where to prioritise surveillance.",
