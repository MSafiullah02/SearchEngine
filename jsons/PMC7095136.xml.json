It has been documented that diabetes was the leading cause of death accounting for 1.5 million death in 2012, whereas in 2014 around 422 million people suffered from it [1]. Diabetes complications include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), strokes, heart disease, fatigue, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic retinopathy, etc. [2]. Diabetes exists in two forms, i.e. diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Out of these two conditions, most of the people are suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2 or T2DM). The leading responsible cause of T2DM is a sedentary life style, genetic makeup, bad food habits, lack of physical activity and obesity. The prevalence of diabetes has been reported to be comparable in low versus high-income countries in 2018 [3].",

The carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins has several biological functions such as cell adhesion, development, immune responses, trafficking, host-pathogen interactions and signaling [5, 7\u20139]. N-glycosylation is essential in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related breakdown cascade, quality control and in protein folding mediated by lectin [10, 11]. Lysosomal enzymes are specific in recognizing and selecting the different abnormal substances over others due to the presence of Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-labelling as a marker [12, 13]. Recognition of glycoproteins displayed on the cell membrane surface is employed by pathogens in the modulation of the host immune response during viral and bacterial infections [14\u201318]. Furthermore, the progression of diseases like autoimmune and cancer disorders inhibit the process of glycosylation [19\u201321]. Interestingly, Monoclonal antibodies among other vital therapeutic proteins are glycosylated and their existence, as well as sugar chain structures, are essential for their stability and biological actions [22, 23]. Accordingly, comprehending the structure and functions of glycoproteins are very essential and inevitable. Therefore, this study aims to delineate the structure and biological roles of glycoproteins in diabetes mellitus emphasizing their involvement in the regulation of this disorder.",

However, a significant increase in the risk of developing T1DM is more in relatives of patients compared to the general population [27\u201329]. More interestingly, if a patient\u2019s parent has T1DM, the risk for developing T1DM is 5% and it becomes higher if, among the parents, the father is the diabetic patient [30]. Reports have identified more than 50 genetic risk loci related to T1DM [31] whereas gene variants occurring in a major locus named major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, also known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) [32] have similarly been reported to confer between 50\u201360% of genetic risk associated with T1DM development [33]. The genetic risk is linked with the expression of the gene by affecting the HLA protein ability to bind to antigenic peptides and their antigen presentation to T cells [34]. It has been reported that an additional 50 genes contribute as smaller effects to T1DM individually [35].",

It was documented that such mechanisms influence islet mRNA expression, function and thus potential risk of diabetes [41]. Studies had demonstrated that several candidate genes (GPX7, GSTT1, and SNX19) directly influence critical biological processes and functions including proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Approximately, 90% of the causal variants in T1DM are noncoding with estimated ~60% mapping to immune-cell enhancers and many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer associated RNA after immune stimulation [42]. In a study to explore the cellular and molecular changes in islets of pancreas and \u03b2 cells in response to immunological stressors (proinflammatory cytokines), it was reported that epigenetic modification (methylation of insulin DNA) may be a mechanism by which insulin gene expression is affected during the progression of T1DM in nonobese diabetic mice [43]. Moreover, to explain discordance of T1DM in identical twins through differential epigenetic variation it was reported that there is an enrichment of differentially variable CpG positions (DVPs) in T1DM twins as compared with other healthy co-twins and with healthy, unrelated individuals, thus hinting the role of epigenetic changes and their associations with the pathogenesis of T1DM [44].",

            "text": "Viral infection is another mechanism implicated in the occurrence of diabetes, however, there is no direct evidence reported as a particular strain of virus being link to cause T1DM [46]. Interestingly, it has been documented that exposure during fetal life to rubella has been shown to increase the incidence of T1DM and other autoimmune disorders [37]. Data from epidemiological studies have strongly suggested the involvement of coxsackievirus B (an enterovirus) in T1DM development as evident from the presence of RNA or proteins from such enteroviruses in pancreas and some other neighboring tissues from T1DM patients. Enteroviruses infect the \u03b2 cells and activate innate immunity and inflammation in the early phase of T1DM. Although as an antiviral protein, virus-induced interferon alpha acts as initiators towards autoimmunity directed against pancreatic \u03b2 cells and this can be deleterious. Moreover, enteroviruses can interact effectively with adaptive immune system by successive or through persistent infections [47]. Host genes, such as IFIH1 which encode melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), influence susceptibility of individuals to T1DM. Reports have shown that an upward activity of the IFIH1 protein activities may promote T1DM development. Once viral infection occurs, MDA5 proteins provoke the proliferation of mediators of the innate antiviral immune response, thus acting as a cytoplasmic sensor to viruses, more especially coxsackieviruses B [48, 49]. In a study to explore the relationship between autoimmunity, insulitis, viral infection, \u03b2 cell function and survival in T1DM, islets from six recent-onset T1DM patients were studied. Enterovirus was found to be able to infect \u03b2 cells in T1DM patients, which is associated with inflammation and functional impairment [50]. Viruses may also induce an autoimmune response by using mechanisms like molecular mimicry, a phenomenon involving the sharing of antigenic properties between \u03b2 cells and environmental agents. Thus immune responses are directed against autoantigens which resemble the actual viruses\u2019 antigens and results in their cellular destruction [37]. P2-C protein of Coxsackie B4 virus, for example, is significantly similar in their amino acid sequence to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) enzyme which is found in \u03b2 cells of endocrine pancreas [37].",

For example, a study documented that at early age administration of dairy products consumption and that of high milk during early childhood increase the levels of antibodies in cow's milk and that high IgA antibodies in cow's milk formula increase the risk of T1DM independently [50]. It was documented that a peculiar part of the albumin from cow\u2019s milk, called the ABBOS, which contain 17 peptides, can function as a self-reactive epitope because of its resemblance to another p69 protein found in at surface of pancreatic \u03b2 cells [51]. Moreover, the ingestion of plants based nutrient elements provided the notion of a link between T1DM and earlier exposures of cereals into the diet [52] and gluten [53]. Inadequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids has also been studied in association with T1DM [54]. Nitrate administration from water intake [55] and toxic doses of nitrosamine compounds may also result in diabetes via generation of some free radicals but it is unclear if dietary nitrate, nitrite, or nitrosamine exposure on human T1D could act in the same manner [56]. Many perinatal risk factors which are seen in childhood diabetes are also linked with T1DM [57] like maternal \u2013 child blood group incompatibility, pre-eclampsia, neonatal infections and respiratory distress, maternal age, gestational age, birth weight and order [58\u201361].",

Previous studies have reported that as healthy infants approach the toddler stage their microbiomes are seen to be healthier and even more stable. However, in children who are destined for autoimmunity usually develop a microbiome with less diversity and stability. Therefore, autoimmune microbiome identified with T1D may be specifically different from that existing in healthy children [62]. It has been known that dietary exposure is the regulator of the immunity and self-tolerance by changing gut microbiome [63]. Even the lack of contact between vaginal microbiome and interferon-induced helicase gene polymorphisms in the Caesarian section indicate the possible protective role during normal labor and vaginal delivery because such children show subsequent gut microbiota differences themselves [64].",

            "text": "Immunological factors could also contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetics mellitus. Disorders associated with routine immune mechanisms may result in autoimmunity that could lead to T1DM. Organ-specific autoimmune disease could cause an autoimmune response against host pancreatic \u03b2 cells. T1DM is similarly complicated often times with other autoimmune diseases and presence of anti-islet autoantibodies precede the clinical onset of disease. The occurrence of anti-islet autoantibodies (islet cell antibodies, ICA) in patients diagnosed with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome was first analyzed in 1974 [65]. Later, researchers reported target autoantigens against ICA, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and more recently against zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) [66\u201368]. Individuals exhibiting positivity for single autoantibody most often revert to negative, however, reversion is not common in people with multiple autoantibodies [69]. The risk of development of T1DM in children with HLA risk genotypes or with their relatives who have been diagnosed with T1DM, is said to occur in two or more islet autoantibodies at 75% within 10 years [70], where the risk increases with the increasing numbers of autoantibodies [70, 71]. The concurrent expression of two or up to three autoantibodies acts as the markers of progression into clinical T1DM [72]. Recently, a study into TEDDY (the environmental determinants of diabetes in the young) funded by the National Institutes of Health, look into individuals who had already established two or more autoantibodies. Krischer et al. suggested that the risk of progression from multiple autoantibodies disorders to T1DM was not seen different among those with or even without a family history of the disease. They also indicated that this was higher in female gender, when a few high-risk HLA-DR and HLA-DQ subtypes are present while their study indicated an inverse relationship to the age of first appearance of positive autoantibodies in the family [73]. The presence of islet autoantibodies illicit immune response on B- and T-cell to the antigens present on \u03b2-cell leading to their loss and function. This eventually leads to initiation of glucose intolerance, a stage prior to onset of diabetes clinical symptoms. \u03b2 cell destruction in T1DM occurs most probably via programmed cell death (apoptosis). Autoreactive T lymphocytes induce inflammatory reactions with the expression of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, INF-\u03b3 (interferon-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) within the islet that activates the caspase cascade. Moreover, other researchers suggested that apoptosis is induced directly from the contact of autoreactive T lymphocytes with \u03b2 cells through the Fas/Fas ligand interaction or perforating system [74, 75]. Chronic inflammation within the islets occurs involving T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells prior to the onset of T1DM that evolves over many months or years with asymptomatic and euglycemic patients. Clinical manifestation of the disease or symptomatic high glucose level (hyperglycemia) occurs after an extended latency period, which is reflected by the destruction of a large number of functioning \u03b2 cells [76]. It has been reported that mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene resulting from recessive Mendelian disorder autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS-1) and APS-1 patients develop multiorgan autoimmune diseases are included in T1DM. The expression of the AIRE protein is key to control the central tolerance induction in the thymus leading to the regulation of the expression levels of tissue-specific peripheral antigens, including insulin [77]. Viral infections can affect thymic epithelial cells and thymocytes. This can be seen with coxsackievirus B4 virus and some other enteroviruses resulting in abnormalities of the differentiation processes of T cells and their maturation [78].",

A population-based Cohort study of twins in Finland to access the concordance of diabetes mellitus has shown that probandwise and pairwise concordance rates for T2DM were found to be 34% and 20% among monozygotic twins and 16% and 9% among dizygotic twins respectively. They documented that the heritability for T1DM was greater than that for T2DM indicating that both environmental and genetic factors seemed to play a critical role [83]. Further studies on the effects of environmental and genetic factors indicated that genetic factors play roles that are more important in the pathogenesis of diabetic than environmental factors [84, 85].",

Such type of cases is reported to be resulted by the most common mutations in glucokinase (GCK) gene and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A (HNF1A) [87]. Unlike T1DM, the genetic component of T2DM involves interaction of multiple genes. Linkage studies have reported calpain 10 (CAPN10) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with T2DM.

On the contrary in T2DM, prolonged dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and increased oxidative stress that results in altered homeostasis could lead to epigenetic changes [97]. DNA methylation in the transcriptional coactivator PPARGC1A promoter (involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion) is elevated in islets of T2DM patients leading to decreased PPARGC1A expression [98] thus suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by human islets. Aging has also been linked to be associated with an increased risk of T2DM [97]. The epigenetic pattern could change during the lifespan affecting key respiratory chain genes such as part of complex four of the respiratory chain (COX7A1). COX7A1, an age-related DNA methylation target expression is decreased express in diabetic skeletal muscle [99]. COX7A1 in human skeletal muscle is associated with elevated in vivo glucose uptake and Vo2max. The data obtained from these studies demonstrate influence of age on gene expression, DNA methylation and their subsequently in vivo metabolism. Pancreatic islet \u03b2-cell proliferation may declines after birth, but proliferation of \u03b2-cell might play an important role in islets adaptation to increased insulin loads imposed by insulin resistance. It has been reported that an elevated expression of Ink4a/Arf (Cdkn2a locus) has been linked with reduced regeneration of \u03b2-cell [100]. The increased Ink4a/Arf expression in aged mice further concurred with reduced levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation at Ink4a/Arf and the histone methyltransferase (Ezh2), with correspondence decrease in Bmi-1 binding and expression of loss of H2A ubiquitylation at Ink4a/Arf [101, 102]. The common variant occurring at the CDKN2A locus is linked with increased risk for T2DM [103].",

The elevated methylation of genes Prdx2 and SCARA3 indicated their role in oxidative stress protection declines due to elevated methylation and might lead to T2DM complications.

Out of these factors, obesity is the major risk factor for T2DM [104, 105] with complex genetic and environmental etiology. The deposition of ectopic fat in the muscle and liver leads to Insulin resistance. The fats may also accumulate in the pancreas and significantly contribute to islet inflammation, decline in \u03b2-cell function and eventually \u03b2-cell death [106]. It has been reported that weight loss improves insulin sensitivity [107] and may prevent the accumulation of pancreatic fat [108]. Furthermore, the only three replicated loci namely MTNR1B, PREX1, and FTO have been found common in both obesity and T2DM. The Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARG (playing a role in adipogenesis) may modulate the risk of T2DM. Reports have shown that the expression of PPARG in adipose tissue of obese subjects is increased [109].",

It has been reported that there is a dose-dependent relationship between the serum concentration of organic pesticides and prevalence of diabetes [110]. Interestingly, obesity could serve as a storage house for such toxic organic pollutants due to their lipophilic profile, which induce insulin resistance and eventually T2DM in a dose- and time-dependent order [111, 112]. Exposure to air pollutants also is associated with higher incidence rates of T2DM [113], predominantly in women (higher risk) possibly by inflammation in adipose tissue and insulin resistance [114]. The highest exposure correlates with a >20% increase in T2DM prevalence after modifying for other risk co-factors which includes education, ethnicity, health insurance, income, indoor pollutant exposures, obesity, population density and smoking [115]. Other chemical contaminants in water or food and occupational exposures to an array of toxins have been reported to be linked with risk of T2DM and mortality. Due to limited number of studies, and small samples these data are still inconclusive [116]. Oxidative stress also contributes to the development of insulin resistance, as the inverse association which exists between plasma vitamin C, serum carotenoids and plasma tocopherol concentrations (as markers of vegetable, fruit intake or dietary supplements) with T2DM and impaired metabolism of glucose has been detected [117, 118]. Therefore, antioxidants might confer protection against T2DM [119].",

Furthermore, the majority of women diagnosed with GDM show \u03b2-cell dysfunction due to chronic insulin resistance already present before pregnancy [123]. Moreover, insulin signaling alterations, decreased expression of PPAR\u03b3 and decreased insulin-mediated glucose transport has also been reported in women with GDM [124]. Diabetes and obesity lead to post-receptor abnormalities in insulin signaling in placenta of women [125]. Since the fetus pose an antigenic load, it was proposed that its event triggers the development of GDM. Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) expression which functions to safeguard the fetus from possible immune attack which is achieved by down-regulating the responses of cytotoxic T cell to fetal trophoblast antigens, is postulated to also protect pancreatic islet cells. The interaction between nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and the HLA-G is suggested to play a key role in GDM development. [126]. Moreover, as in T1DM, defects associated with \u03b2-cell function could also result from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic \u03b2- cells responsible for production of insulin in GDM women and such occurrence in subjects could lead to rapid development in overt diabetes soon after pregnancy [127]. Additionally, mutations in genes which leads to several subtypes of MODY have been observed in women with GDM (account for less than 10% of all GDM cases) that include mutations in encoded genes for glucokinase, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 and insulin promoter factor 1 [124].",

The amide group of an Asn unit is co-translationally bonded to Dol-P-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 precursor. This co-translational addition of oligosaccharide takes place in the ER and this is seen to have an impact on protein folding and the requirement for the N-glycosylation is the sequence motif of Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr (where Xaa represents any amino acid except proline) [160]. While another rare sequence motif of Asn-Xaa-Cys has been indicated to behave as an acceptor site [161]. Some researchers reported that the Asn-Xaa-Ser acceptor motif is not well used compared to motif Asn-Xaa-Thr [162]. Moreover, oligosaccharyltransferase is the enzyme required for the addition of N-linked precursor to amino acids, it is situated in the ER, and this action is conserved process of evolution in eukaryotic organisms. A ring structure can be formed by an Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr by which the basic unit of the oligosaccharyltransferases can act upon [163]. Two \u03b1-linked core mannose units are found in the hybrid glycans, the high mannose has only GlcNAc core and mannose residue while the complex glycoproteins have altered digit branches. GlcNAc unit is found at least in each branch [163].",

For instance, N-glycoproteins biosynthesis in eukaryotes is carried out in several steps in the Golgi apparatus and ER compartment of cells. In the ER with several glycosyltransferases, a big oligosaccharide template (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is aligned on a lipid carrier called dolichol [177]. A multi-subunit oligosaccharyltransferase mediates the transfer of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide to amide group of Asn side on the ribosome and in a concerted sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr of a growing polypeptide. Subsequently, the template is processed to specific glycoform of monoglucosylate (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2) which is used in the protein folding linked associated with calnexin/calreticulin chaperone, which is responsible for the control of quality protein. Once the precursor (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is properly folded, it is further trimmed to Man8GlcNAc2-protein in the ER within its lumen and then transported to the Golgi bodies to produce several glycoforms including complex, high mannose and hybrid type glycotypes. In species-, proteins-, and/or cell type-site specific manner, several glycosyltransferases, and glycosidase catalyses the N-glycans processing. Diverse and different glycoprotein glycotypes are synthesized as a result of sensitivity of the physiological state of cells and differential expression of the enzymes involved [177].",

Protein components of glycoproteins are responsible majorly for their biological activities, while the carbohydrate components play key roles in the molecular stability [180]. Carbohydrate content of fibronectin, interleukin 5 (IL-5) and interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) play key role in their stability. Fibronectin is more sensitive to proteolysis without their carbohydrate, while IL-5 carbohydrate stabilizes its molecular conformation when exposure to heat. Similarly, carbohydrates are responsible for the decreased sensitivity of glycosylated IFN-\u03b2 compared to unglycosylated IFN-\u03b2 [198\u2013200]. The biological effects of carbohydrate in glycoproteins have also been demonstrated using glycoengineering. For instance, mucins are heavily O-glycosylated, and express an increase in their gel-like properties due to the presence of high sialic acid content. Additional of more carbohydrates through N-linkage to native sequence leptin through glycoengineering [201], increase the solubility of the resultant glycosylated leptin over several folds compared with the native leptin [180]. Another example has been demonstrated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on the role of carbohydrate in maintaining their molecular stability and protection from free radicals. Asialo-rHuEPO (without sialic acid) and fully deglycosylated rHuEPO lost them in vitro biological activities when heat-treated, however, glycosylated rHuEPO lose no activity upon same heat treatment [202]. Similarly, Unglycosylated rHuEPO are denatured easily by treatment with heat, pH, and guanidine-HCl while glycosylated rHuEPO remains soluble and displays reversible folding, unlike aggregates and precipitates formed from the previous treatment in unglycosylated rHuEPO [203, 204]. More so, the carbohydrate component of rHuEPO has been identified to protect peptide components from the adverse effects of free oxygen radicals [205].",

While DA and rHuEPO have similar conformation and stability, the addition of more carbohydrate to DA did not blunt the biological response from various intracellular signaling that were examined [201]. Similarly, the role of glycosylation of glycoprotein to enhance their in vivo activities is demonstrated by leptin. Leptins are nonglycosylated protein responsible for the regulation of body weight. Glycoengineered leptin analog which is rich in carbohydrates (GE-LeptinL4-58) administered to obese mice, caused more weight loss and maintained their reduced weight, which was observed for a longer period of time compared with unglycosylated recombinant human leptin [201]. In general, carbohydrate may influence the specific activities of glycoprotein by affecting the glycoprotein tertiary structures, or affect the ligand-receptors interactions through steric effects or perhaps through a charge effect related to the presence of sialic acids on the oligosaccharides of their ligands or receptors or both [208, 209].",

The orientation of the glycoproteins is such that it contains N-linked glycosylation site, several O-linked glycans, and a GPI-anchor. The N-linked glycoforms are highly heterogeneous, consisting of more than a hundred complex-types. The glycan seems to play major roles in affecting CD59 and binding affinity, indicating that the glycan affects cell surface packaging of proteins and prevents their aggregation on the cell surface. Hydrophilic type of glycan, are proposed to limit interaction of the protein with lipid bilayer and in turn facilitation their diffusion along cell membranes [220].

The motion of the amide nitrogen within the glycosylated sites are highly restricted. Residues around the glycosylation site also express considerable rigidity. Similarly, the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc1 is severely restricted compared with mobility of other amide nitrogens in the rigid polypeptide backbone. The study suggested that carbohydrate is essential to stabilize the region around the glycosylation site of CD2. hCG contains 92 amino acid residues with \u03b1-subunit in the \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimeric protein and glycosylated at Asn52 and Asn78. De Beer et al. NMR studies on free \u03b1-subunit of hCG and the influence of the \u03b2-subunit on conformation and N-glycosylation of the \u03b1-subunit indicated that Asn52 glycosylation site on the glycoprotein appears to implicate signal transduction and heterodimer association. Their studies further indicated that carbohydrate at the Asn78 plays critical roles in maintaining structure of the \u03b1-subunit. Aside from the critical stability role Asn78, no direct biological activity\u2019s role was observed, however, mutant lacking the Asn78 amino acid unit is poorly secreted and degraded rapidly in vivo [225]. Generally, carbohydrates contribute exclusively to entropic terms, while hydrophobic contacts established made between peptide residues contribute to enthalpic energy. Critical observation of the stability of glycoproteins in most cases, attributes their stability due to large entropic effects rather than enthalpy effects [220].",

One of these remedies is Cardiospermum halicacabum leaf, which has been used in Chinese medicine. In this study, Veeramani et al. investigated the protective effect of Cardiospermum halicacabum leaf extract (CHE) on plasma and tissue glycoproteins metabolism of male albino Wistar rats. The animals were made diabetic by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, then rats were divided into five groups of six rats each: Group I: Normal, Group II: Normal + CHE, Group III: Diabetic control rats, Group IV: Diabetic + CHE, Group V: Diabetic + glibenclamide. Diabetic rats exhibited an elevated level of blood glucose and treatment with CHE and glibenclamide showed a decreased level of blood glucose. This investigation also indicates that oral administration of Cardiospermum halicacabum leaf extract for 45 days significantly decreased plasma and tissue glycoproteins due to improved glycemic control [231].",
