This virus emerged in the human population in the final months of 2019 from a, so far unidentified, animal reservoir and has since spread across the globe [1]. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses an enormous burden on society, economic and healthcare systems worldwide, and various measures are being taken to control its spread. Many of these measures critically depend on the timely and accurate diagnosis of virus-infected individuals. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and therefore preferred [2,3]. Whereas many COVID-19 RT-PCR kits are currently commercially available, an independent assessment of these products is not yet publicly available and direly needed to guide implementation of accurate tests in a diagnostic market that is flooded with new tests. As of 11 April 2020, the FIND organization listed 201 molecular assays on their website as being on the market (www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that express their replication and transcription complex, including their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), from a single, large open reading frame referred to as ORF1ab [4]. The coronavirus structural proteins, including the envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) proteins, are expressed via the production of subgenomic messenger RNAs, which during certain stages of the replication cycle far outnumber (anti)genomic RNAs. The ORF1ab/RdRp, E, N, and S genes are the targets most frequently used for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR. For example, the \u201cCorman\u201d PCR, which was co-developed in our lab and is now routinely used for our in-house diagnostic work, targets a combination of the E-gene and the RdRp-gene [2]. In this set-up, the E-gene primer/probe set is specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses, and therefore detects both SARS-CoV-1 and -2. In addition, whereas the RdRp-gene primers are also specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses, two probes are used: one specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses and another specific for SARS-CoV-2. In this study we only used the RdRp probe that is specific for SARS-CoV-2.",

One of these kits (BGI) was recently also included in a comparative study of various SARS-CoV-2 primer/probe sets [5]. Most of the selected kits are CE-IVD certified and can be produced in large quantities. Using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 RNA we determine the 95% limit of detection (LOD95%) for each of these assays. In addition, a concise panel of clinical samples (n = 22) was run to provide a first indication of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Although some kits appeared to perform better than others at identifying clinical samples at very low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, all tests were able to identify positive samples with Ct\u226434.5 in our in-house E-gene PCR. Therefore, we conclude that all of the RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.",

Promising commercial kits were selected based on: 1) listing on the FindDx website; 2) responsiveness to requests; 3) accessible information (in English); 4) compatibility with different PCR platforms; 5) considerable production capacity. Notably, all of the PCR kits that we had selected for our analysis have in the meantime also been selected for the first round of independent evaluation by FIND (www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-molecular/, April 2020). All of the kits included in our analysis were provided free of charge and none of the manufacturers were involved in the assessment and interpretation of the results. The selection encompasses both kits that require transport and storage at \u221220 \u00b0C and kits that can be transported and stored at room temperature. Target genes for each RT-PCR kit were available in the assay documentation or upon request (for an overview, see Table 1). All PCRs were run on a LightCycler 480 II (LC480II, Roche) and performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use. Of note however, for some kits (BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene) settings for the LC480II were not provided and were therefore adapted from those provided for another machine.",

We determined the slope by linear regression in GraphPad Prism and defined the required levels for PCR efficiency (E) and R2 as >95% and >0.95, respectively. Next, we ran four replicates of a 2-fold dilution series (diluted in yeast carrier RNA in water) to determine the LOD95% by Probit analysis using SPSS Statistics (IBM, version 24). The limited range of the dilution series did not allow for determination of a confidence interval for the LOD95% for all assays, which should therefore be regarded as an approximation and not considered definitive. The starting concentration of the viral RNA (copies/ml) was determined by digital PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-gene and was specific for the positive sense genomic RNA [2].",

            "text": "From a selection of clinical samples with various concentrations of viral RNA (n = 13), all RT-PCR kits were able to positively identify the ten samples with the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct\u226434.5 in our in-house E-gene PCR). To provide an indication on clinical relevance of this finding: from our in-house diagnostic data on patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms, it appears that from all individuals testing positive for our in-house E-gene PCR (n = 416) the proportion of individuals with a Ct value >34.5 is approximately 3.6% (unpublished data). The R-Biopharm AG kit positively identified the highest number of clinical samples, i.e. 13 out of 13, comparable with our in-house PCR. Three kits were able to positively identify 12 out of 13 samples (BGI, KH Medical, Seegene). Notably, we performed our analysis using only a small number of clinical samples and we therefore advise that diagnostic laboratories in the field conduct additional and more extensive in-house clinical validations upon implementation of novel RT-PCR kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity towards a panel of other respiratory (corona)viruses, except for the expected cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. Since the latter virus is no longer known to be circulating in the human population, we consider this cross-reactivity acceptable.",

For the Seegene kit, one sample was \u201cinconclusive\u201d according to the manufacturer\u2019s guide for interpretation and was therefore counted as \u201cnegative\u201d, although a signal was observed for at least one target.
