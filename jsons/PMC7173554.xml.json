John Snow is called the father of modern epidemiology because he developed excellent quantitative methods while studying the source of a cholera outbreak at the Broad Street pump in London in 1849. Snow was followed by William Farr, who in the 1870s advanced the use of vital statistics and clarified many of the principles of risk assessment and retrospective and prospective studies. Their vision is reflected in the fast-changing science of epidemiology which is now supported by advanced computer technology, sophisticated statistical methods and very sensitive and specific diagnostic systems.",

Prevalence rate is the ratio of the total number of cases occurring in a population to the size of the population during a specified period of time.\nSeroprevalence rate relates to the occurrence of antibody to a particular virus in a population. Because viral antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies, often last a lifetime, seroprevalence rates usually represent cumulative experience with the virus. The term\ncase-fatality rate is used to indicate the percentage of subjects with a particular disease that die from the disease. All these rates may be affected by various attributes that distinguish one individual from another: age, sex, genetic constitution, immune status, nutritional status and various behavioral and medical care and patient management parameters.

In many cases, disruption of normal host defense mechanisms leads to entry that might otherwise be thwarted; for example, papillomaviruses may enter the deep layers of the skin via abrasions, acid-labile coronaviruses may enter the intestine protected by the buffering capacity of milk, and influenza viruses may enter the lower respiratory tract because a drug has dampened cilial action of the respiratory epithelium.",

Their relative frequency accounts for the difficulty of tracing chains of transmission, even with the help of laboratory diagnostics. Although clinical cases may be somewhat more productive sources of virus than subclinical infections, because the latter do not restrict the movement of the infected host, they can be most important as sources of viral dissemination. In most acute infections, whether clinically apparent or not, virus is shed in highest titers during the late stages of the incubation period, before the influence of the host immune response takes effect. Persistent infections, whether or not they are associated with episodes of clinical disease, also play an important role in the perpetuation of many viruses in nature. For example, prolonged virus shedding can reintroduce virus into a population of susceptibles all of which have been born since the last clinically apparent episode of infection. This is important in the survival of rubella virus in some isolated populations. Sometimes the persistence of infection, the production of disease and the transmission of virus are dissociated; for example, togavirus and arenavirus infections have little adverse effect on their reservoir hosts (arthropods, birds and rodents) but transmission is very efficient. On the other hand, the persistence of infection in the central nervous system, as with measles virus in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), is of no epidemiological significance, since no infectious virus is shed from this site.",

Highly virulent strains of the virus were found to kill rabbits so quickly that transmission did not occur, and naturally attenuated strains were found to produce minimal lesions that healed quickly and did not permit transmission. Virus strains at either extreme of this virulence spectrum were found not to survive in nature, but virus strains of intermediate virulence have circulated for many years.",

            "text": "It is self-evident that the long-term survival of a virus requires that it be continuously transmitted from one host to another. In general, for rapidly and efficiently transmitted viruses such as many respiratory viruses, local survival of the virus requires that the susceptible host population be very large. A virus may disappear from a population because it exhausts its potential supply of susceptible hosts as they acquire immunity to reinfection with the same virus. Depending on duration of immunity and the pattern of virus shedding, the critical population size varies considerably with different viruses and with different host species. The most precise data on the importance of population size in acute nonpersistent infections come from studies of measles.\nPersistence of measles virus in a population depends on a continuous supply of susceptible children. Analyses of the incidence of measles in large cities and in island communities have shown that a population of about half a million persons is needed to ensure a large enough annual input of new susceptible hosts, by birth or immigration, to maintain measles virus in the population. Because infection depends on respiratory transmission, the duration of epidemics of measles is correlated inversely with population density. If a population is dispersed over a large area, the rate of spread is reduced and the epidemic will last longer, so that the number of susceptible persons needed to maintain transmission chains is reduced. On the other hand, in such a situation a break in the transmission chain is much more likely. When a large proportion of the population is initially susceptible, the intensity of the epidemic builds up very quickly and attack rates are almost 100% (virgin-soil epidemic).",

Over 500 arboviruses are known, of which about 100 cause disease in humans and 40 in domestic animals; some of these are transmitted by ticks, some by mosquitoes and yet others by phlebotomine flies (sandflies) or Culicoides spp. (midges).\nArthropod transmission may be mechanical, where the arthropod acts as a \u2018flying pin\u2019, or more commonly, biological, involving replication of the virus in the arthropod vector. The arthropod vector acquires virus by feeding on the blood of a viremic person or animal. Replication of the ingested virus, initially in the arthropod's gut, and its spread to the salivary glands takes several days; the interval varies with different viruses and is influenced by ambient temperature. Virions in the salivary secretions of the vector are injected into animal hosts during subsequent blood meals. Most arboviruses have localized natural habitats in which specific receptive arthropod and vertebrate hosts are involved in the viral life cycle. Vertebrate reservoir hosts are usually wild mammals or birds; humans are rarely involved in primary transmission cycles, although the exceptions to this generalization are important (e.g. Venezuelan equine encephalitis, yellow fever and dengue viruses). Humans are in most cases infected incidentally, for example by the geographic extension of a reservoir vertebrate host and/or a vector arthropod. Ecological changes produced by human activities disturb natural arbovirus life cycles and have been incriminated in the geographic spread or increased prevalence of arbovirus diseases.",

With the development of computer-based mathematical modeling techniques, there has been a resurgence of interest in the population dynamics of infectious diseases. There has also been a resurgence in controversies surrounding the use of models: critics say \u2018for every model there is an equal and opposite model\u2019. Models are used to determine: (1) patterns of disease transmission; (2) critical population sizes to support the continuous transmission of viruses with short and long incubation periods; (3) the dynamics of endemicity of viruses that become persistent in their hosts; and (4) the variables in age-dependent viral pathogenicity. Computer modeling also provides useful insights into the effectiveness of disease control programs. Much attention has been given to modeling the future of the acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) epidemic in the United States and the rest of the world. Such models usually start with historical data on the introduction of the etiologic virus, HIV1, proceed to the present stage of the epidemic where the disease has become well established in many countries and in fewer subject to prevention and treatment strategies, and then proceed to project its course into the future. During the first 10 years of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, African countries and then in Asian countries most models underestimated developing trends; more recently models have become more accurately predictive.",
