This interval of care in the PICU begins with brain death and consent to donation and culminates with surgical organ procurement. It generally ranges from 12 to 48 h or longer and is related to the time required for repeated brain death declarations, consent discussions with the family, procurement logistics of donor/ organ evaluation, and donor/recipient matching. During this phase, risks for hemodynamic instability and compromise of end organ function are high (Table 38 .1 ). There is a significant opportunity for enhancing donor multi-organ function and improving organ utilization with appropriate medical management [ 1 ] . The brain dead organ donor is in a distinct and challenging pathophysiological condition that culminates in a state of multifactorial shock. The current level of evidence supporting practices in pediatric donor management is limited by the inherent lack of prospective trial data, and based largely on adult human and animal studies; however, donor management practice is of increasing importance [ 2 -5 ] . PICU care should be tailored by principles similar to the management of any patient with multifactorial shock. It is important to treat the donor as one would treat the transplant recipient. This can be accomplished by understanding the physiology of brain death coupled with aggressive and attentive PICU management. Figure 38 .1 shows the Canadian experience of organ utilization across all age groups, comparable to international rates [ 6 -8 ] . Utilization rates vary from region to region and transplant center to transplant center. Rates for heart and lung utilization have the greatest capacity for quantitative improvement. For the purposes of most international reports, a \"donor\" is one who has provided at least one organ that has been transplanted (Table 38. 2 ). Initial interventions to increase transplantation focused on identifi cation, referral, and consent of the donor, recent pursuit of organ yield has gained importance [ 9 ] . Pediatric investigators have reported rates of 3.6 organs per donor (of eight possible organs), but 22 % of consented pediatric donors failed to provide any transplantable organs primarily due to hemodynamic instability during the phase of PICU donor care [ 10 ] .",

            "text": "The deterioration of cardiovascular and pulmonary function associated with intracranial hypertension will vary with the rapidity of rise of intracranial pressure (ICP) [ 12 ] , time after herniation, and presence of coexisting forms of myocardial injury e.g., traumatic myocardial contusion, ischemia after cardiac arrest, shock, or hypoxemia [ 13 , 14 ] . In the face of markedly elevated ICP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) rises in an effort to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. As ICP rises further, cerebral herniation into the brainstem ensues, and brainstem ischemia is initiated in an orderly, rostral-caudal fashion. Initial apnea, bradycardia, hypotension and drop in cardiac output are mediated by vagal (parasympathetic) activation resulting from midbrain ischemia. Brainstem ischemia then progresses toward the pons, where sympathetic stimulation is superimposed on the initial vagal response, resulting in bradycardia and hypertension (the classic Cushing's refl ex) [ 15 ] . During this period, the ECG may be characterized by sinus bradycardia, junctional escape beats, and even complete heart block [ 16 ] . Further extension into the medulla oblongata occurs, at which point the vagal cardiomotor nucleus becomes ischemic, preventing tonic vagal stimuli. This results in unopposed sympathetic stimulation which may last for minutes to hours and manifests as arterial hypertension with elevated cardiac output with the potential for tachyarrhythymias [ 16 ] . This period of unopposed sympathetic stimulation is often termed the \"autonomic\" or \"sympathetic storm\" during which time cardiotoxicity occurs and severe vasoconstriction may compromise end organ perfusion [ 17 , 18 ] . Subsequent changes occur in oxygen consumption and delivery [ 19 ] . Herniation triggers an infl ammatory cascade that affects cardiorespiratory function, and hormonal regulation [ 20 ] . This cascade affects pituitary and hypothalamic function resulting in catecholamine, thyroid, and vasopressin abnormalities [ 21 -24 ] .",

Endogenous catecholaminerelated increases in peripheral resistance may result in a sudden increase in myocardial work and oxygen consumption leading to myocardial ischemia or infarction and subsequent elevation of cardiac troponin I and T [ 15 , 28 ] . Patients dying of acute intracranial events show scattered foci of transmural myocardial injury that are not seen in patients dying of noncerebral causes [ 29 ] . Myocardial necrosis after subarachnoid hemorrhage is a neurally mediated process that is dependent on the severity of neurological injury [ 30 ] . Brain dead cardiac donors with elevations in cardiac troponin I have been shown to have diffuse subendocardial myocytolysis and coagulative necrosis and a high incidence of graft failure after transplantation [ 31 ] . The magnitude of the rise of epinephrine after brain death and the extent of myocardial damage have also been shown to depend on the rate of rise in ICP in a canine model [ 12 , 32 ] . Dogs given a sudden rise in ICP demonstrated a higher epinephrine surge and poorly functioning donor hearts. Surgical sympathectomy [ 33 ] or pharmacologic sympathetic blockade in humans [ 34 ] and animals [ 35 , 36 ] effectively prevents the ICP-related catecholamine cardiotoxicity and the electrophysiologic, biochemical and pathologic changes characteristic of neurogenic injury in the heart. While the ICP-related sympathetic storm is characterized by myocardial injury and high systemic vascular resistance, it is soon followed by period of sympathetic depletion and a low SVR state. Brain dead patients become functionally decapitated and the sympathetic system is anatomically interrupted, similar to high spinal cord injuries [ 37 ] .",

Transient focal cerebral ischemia upregulates the transcriptional levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and other markers [ 44 , 45 ] . Rapid rises of ICP causes immune activation in peripheral organs resulting in enhanced immunogenicity [ 32 ] . In animal models, brain death has a detrimental effect on hepatic dysfunction related to immune activation and appears to be independent of hemodynamic instability [ 46 ] and magnifi ed by longer ischemic times [ 47 ] . In comparison to living related kidney donors, kidneys from brain dead donors have signifi cantly higher levels of pro-infl ammatory mediators on biopsy (endothelial E-selectin and proximal tubular expression of HLA-DR antigens, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) [ 48 , 49 ] . Delayed renal graft function and acute rejection in the recipient is correlated to higher indices of free radical mediated injury in the donor [ 50 , 51 ] . Evidence that neurogenic pulmonary edema may be alleviated with glucocorticoids also suggests that an infl ammatory component exists in this process [ 52 , 53 ] . Recent animal work suggests that this infl ammation is triggered by the acute hemodynamic effects of ICP-related neurogenic myocardial dysfunction, resulting in hydrostatic pressure based neurogenic pulmonary edema and rupture of the alveolar-capillary membrane [ 39 , 54 ] . Brain death is an important risk factor itself and infl uences graft outcomes, mediated by postischemic reperfusion injury and other nonantigen-dependent infl ammatory pathways [ 55 , 56 ] . Deleterious processes such as infl ammation and fi brosis occur in donor organs [ 57 ] potentiating graft immunogenicity and increases host alloresponsiveness organs, developing and contributing to reduced graft survival [ 58 ] . These fi ndings may used to introduce specifi c cytoprotective interventions in the brain dead donor to reduce the immunogenicity or the pro-infl ammatory status of the graft and better maintain or increase organ viability. Anti-infl ammatory therapies may be benefi cial on eventual graft status [ 45 ] .",

A contributing factor to this association may be the effect of starvation on the liver with depletion of glycogen stores.

However, the only human series of liver transplants that included donor nutritional status failed to identify an independent effect of donor nutrition on postoperative liver graft function [ 115 ] .

Other investigators were unable to demonstrate any improvement in echocardiographic function or organ retrieval rates with a similar hormone regimen [ 142 ] . Serum free T 3 concentrations in organ donors may not correlate with hemodynamic stability [ 118 ] but replacement of thyroid hormone (T3) has shown to reduce need for vasopressor support and may improve the likelihood of heart transplantations [ 143 -146 ] . There is equipoise for routine use since many other studies did not show improvement in cardiac and hemodynamic status [ 147 , 148 ] . T 4 infusion rather than T3 does not reduce vasopressor requirements or especially in pediatric donors [ 21 ] but this may be related to impaired peripheral conversion to T 3 . While there are numerous theoretical advantages of parenteral T 3 over T 4 (stability for iv infusion, does not require peripheral tissue conversion), it is extremely expensive in comparison to intravenous T 4 and may not be commercially available in many countries. In those UNOS patients receiving hormone therapy, T 4 was used in 93 % and T 3 in 6.9 % of cases, with insuffi cient numbers to discriminate any benefi t of T 3 over T 4 [Rosendale, Kauffman, personal communication]. Most studies for thyroid replacement in the context of the organ donor are of low quality with poor study design, thus limiting objective analysis [ 149 ] .",

Recovery of organs was most benefi cial to heart and lung transplantation [ 155 ] . Analysis of UNOS data suggests a substantial benefi t from hormone therapy with minimal risk. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of 18,726 brain dead donors showed signifi cant increases in kidney, liver and heart utilization from donors receiving three-drug hormonal therapy. Signifi cant improvements in 1-year kidney graft survival and heart transplant patient survival were also demonstrated [ 147 , 148 , 150 ] . More recently, however, in a prospective randomized study T3 and methylprednisolone did not add to the effect on cardiac index shown by vasopressin and aggressive cardiovascular support [ 156 ] .

While approximately 5 % of all donors will be bacteremic at the time of procurement, the routine use of broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime/ cefotaxime) in the recipient has been shown to prevent transmission of bacterial infection in organ recipients [ 164 , 165 ] . Importantly, donor infections do not show differences in acute mortality or graft survival. The current expansion of potential marginal donors has increased the risk of infection. One study quoted bacteremia rates in the donor up to 21 % [ 166 ] . Donors with ICU stays greater than 3 days, rescue CPR, and inotropic agents are at increased risk [ 167 ] . Though rates of infections in donors may be up, organs obtained from donors with positive cultures continue to be transplanted safely, likely due to vigilant screening and polymicrobial therapy given to recipients [ 168 , 169 ] . Other authors have described the successful transplantation of organs from donors declared brain dead from meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitides , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli without transmission to the recipient [ 170 ] . The fi nding of positive cultures does not preclude donation but may delay procurement until 24-48 h of treatment has been established. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy in the organ donor is generally not recommended. Viral infections in the donor can affect recipients especially with post transplant immunosuppression. However, many chronic infections such as hepatitis B and C virus no longer preclude donation.

Steroid administration may also reduce progressive lung water accumulation [ 101 ] . Prolonged ventilation in the supine position results in loss of alveolar expansion and microatelectasis. In an experimental rat model, donor lungs develop microatelectasis despite PEEP and a relatively short ventilatory period before organ procurement [ 218 ] . Prevention of alveolar collapse enhances post mortem preservation of pulmonary grafts in a rabbit model [ 219 ] . Recruitment maneuvers in the form of high sustained PEEP for short durations may be a useful adjunct to prevent alveolar stress and collapse [ 220 ] .

Vasopressin 0.0003-0.0007 U/kg/min (0.3-0.7 mU/kg/min) to a maximum dose of 2.4 U/h 3. Methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg (\u22641 g) iv q24h Indications: 1. 2D echocardiographic ejection fraction \u2264 40 %, or 2. Hemodynamic instability (includes shock unresponsive to restoration of normovolemia and requiring vasoactive support [dopamine >10 \u03bcg/min or any other vasopressor agent]) 3. Consideration should be given to its use in all donors Hematology 1. Hemoglobin (Hgb) optimal \u2265 100 g/L for unstable donors, lowest acceptable \u2265 70 g/L 2. Platelets, INR, PTT no predefi ned targets, transfuse in cases of clinically relevant bleeding 3. No special transfusion requirements Microbiology (baseline, Q24h and PRN) 1. Daily blood cultures 2. Daily urine cultures 3. Daily endotracheal tube (ETT) cultures 4. Antibiotics for presumed or proven infection Heart Specifi c 1. 12-lead EKG 2. Troponin I or T, q12h 3. 2D echocardiography a. Should only be performed after fl uid and hemodynamic resuscitation b. If 2D echo ejection fraction \u2264 40 % then repeat echocardiography at q6-12 h intervals Lung specifi c 1. Chest x-ray q24h and PRN 2. Bronchoscopy and bronchial wash gram stain and culture 3. Routine ETT suctioning, rotation to lateral position q2h 4. Mechanical ventilation targets: a. Tidal volume (Vt) 8-10 ml/kg, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm H 2 0, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) \u2264 30 cm H 2 O b. pH 7.35-7.45, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) 35-45 mmHg, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) \u2265 80 mmHg, oxygen (O 2 ) sat \u2265 95 % 5. Recruitment maneuvers for oxygenation impairment may include: a. Periodic increases in PEEP up to 15 cm H 2 O b. Sustained infl ations (PIP @ 30 cm H 2 O \u00d7 30-60 s) c.
