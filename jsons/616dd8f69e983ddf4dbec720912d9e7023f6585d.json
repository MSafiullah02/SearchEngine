The virus exists in many different genetic forms which made the disease control very difficult. The present study describes the development and validation of TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) targeting the S1 coding region of S gene characteristic for the GII-1 lineage (formerly the D1466-like variant) of IBV. These strains are quite different from other European IBV belonging to different lineages of the GI genotype. The developed method was 30-fold more sensitive than used so far for standard nested RT-PCR with detection limit of 56 RNA copies per reaction. The specificity of the assay was also evaluated with a panel of different poultry pathogens. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method was very high with coefficients of variation lower than 4%. One hundred and twenty-seven IBV-positive samples were tested by this method and GII-1 strains were detected in four of them (3\u00c115%) which indicate a decrease in the GII-1 IBV prevalence in Poland.

Infectious bronchitis virus belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) (Carstens 2010; Dong et al. 2007 ) and its genome consists of an approximately 30-kb-long single-stranded, positivesense RNA. The genome structure and the biology of the virus predispose for changes in IBV genome (Ovchinnikova et al. 2011; Woo et al. 2009 ). The most important are changes in the spike protein gene (S), especially in its S1 part which encodes extracellular protein subdomain since they may imply a change in the antigenicity or pathogenicity of the virus. So far, many genotypes, serotypes or protectotypes have been identified, depending on the method used for differentiation. However, even the most commonly used genotyping results were sometimes ambiguous because there were no standard rules that should be followed. That's why new classification based on S1 coding region sequence which distinguished and named 32 lineages arranged in six genotypes has been recently proposed (Valastro et al. 2016) . The GII-1 lineage (named also D1466 or D212 variant) of IBV was detected for the first time in the Netherlands in the late 1970s as an aetiological factor of problems connected with egg losses (Davelaar et al. 1984; de Wit et al. 2011) . Interestingly, the S1 coding region of this variant was different from other European IBV strains which resulted in its classification to the GII genotype together with Dutch V1397 strain (Valastro et al. 2016) . For many years the D1466 strains has been only occasionally recognized but results of a molecular survey conducted between 2005 and 2006 indicated increasing problems connected with this variant in most countries of Western Europe (Worthington et al. 2008) . In Poland this variant emerged in 2011 and subsequently has been identified in different parts of the country (Domanska- Blicharz et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 292, "text": "(Carstens 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 293, "end": 309, "text": "Dong et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 490, "end": 516, "text": "(Ovchinnikova et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 517, "end": 532, "text": "Woo et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1199, "text": "(Valastro et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1417, "text": "(Davelaar et al. 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1437, "text": "de Wit et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1628, "end": 1650, "text": "(Valastro et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1909, "text": "(Worthington et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2054, "text": "Blicharz et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "For IBV detection different molecular assays have been described including conventional reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Adzhar et al. 1996; Farsang et al. 2002) , labelled TaqMan probe-or SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR (real-time RT-PCR) assays or reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) (Callison et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2010; Fellahi et al. 2016; Jones et al. 2011; Meir et al. 2010) . The next step is identification of detected IBV strain, which relays on amplification, sequencing and BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Research Tool) or phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of S1 coding region. Recently proposed IBV classification is based on the sequence of the entire S1 part with a length of 1620 nt but this is only possible for highly specialized molecular laboratories (Valastro et al. 2016) . The main obstacle is the lack of universal primers and sometimes many primers should be tested before final strain identification which could be a very time and labour consuming. On the other hand, information about IBV circulating in the field should be quickly obtained as it is important for selecting suitable protective vaccine. The real-time RT-PCR assays seem to be effective tools for IBV-type identification and although S1 coding region is prone to mutations, methods aimed in this gene detection has been recently developed and used for GI-1 (Mass, Connecticut), GI-9 (Arkansas), GI-11 (SAI), G1-16 (ASAII) and GIV-1 (DE072/GA98) lineages (Acevedo et al. 2013; Marandino et al. 2016; Roh et al. 2014 Roh et al. , 2013 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 164, "text": "(Adzhar et al. 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 165, "end": 185, "text": "Farsang et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 347, "end": 369, "text": "(Callison et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 370, "end": 387, "text": "Chen et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 388, "end": 408, "text": "Fellahi et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 409, "end": 427, "text": "Jones et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 428, "end": 445, "text": "Meir et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 837, "end": 859, "text": "(Valastro et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1533, "text": "(Acevedo et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1556, "text": "Marandino et al. 2016;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1572, "text": "Roh et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1590, "text": "Roh et al. , 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "For detection of GII-1 (D1466-like) IBV lineage standard nested RT-PCR assay is commonly applied.

Here, we describe the development of a TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR for the detection of GII-1 (D1466-like) IBV lineage. We also describe the conclusions from the routine use of this method, which was implemented in our laboratory in 2014.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Optimizing of GII-1 real-time RT-PCR In the present work we have successfully developed a highly sensitive TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of GII-1 lineage of IBV. So far, standard nested RT-PCR assay was commonly used for this purpose (Cavanagh et al. 1999; Worthington et al. 2008) . Both methods target similar fragment of S1 coding fragment which is crucial for IBV-type determination. However, the primers and probe designed for real-time RT-PCR met single mismatches in nucleotide sequences of D1466-like IBV strains previously detected in Poland and they include some degenerative ones (two in the reverse primer and two in the probe) to avoid failure in this genotype detection. The standard curve and linear regression analysis were performed using serial dilutions of known quantity of GII-1 IBV RNA (Fig. 1) . C t values ranged from 17\u00c170 to 37\u00c103 cycles (Table 1) with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0\u00c1996. The slope of \u00c03\u00c1168 reveals a very high RT-PCR efficiency (106%). The limit of detection of the GII-1 IBV real-time RT-PCRs and universal for all gammacoronavirus were similar at the level of an approximately 56 copies of viral RNA. The sensitivity of the standard nested RT-PCR was almost 30-fold lower and detected the presence about 1500 copies of viral RNA (Table 1) . Moreover, the assay developed in the present study showed to be highly specific as no fluorescent signals were detected with other tested IBV lineages or chicken RNA viral pathogens. The intra and interassay precision of the new method were assessed using serial dilutions of D1466 IBV RNA ranging from 8\u00c12 9 10 6 down to 5\u00c16 9 10 1 copies.

In 2005, the average frequency of the D1466-like virus in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany was about 3-5%, and in 2006 the presence of this variant increased to 7, 10 and 16% respectively.

When testing field samples, the C t values obtained were relatively high (mean C t values of 32\u00c14 AE 3\u00c18) which address the mean amount of virus RNA about 1500 copies per reaction. The low number of GII-1 IBV RNA copies in most cases did not parallel the C t values obtained in universal real-time RT-PCR which were much lower. This was due to the presence of other IBV lineages in these samples. Subsequent applied assays aimed at the identification of other IBV lineages revealed the presence GI-1 (Mass-like), GI-13 (793B-like), GI-19 (QX-like) or GI-23 (Var2-like) in almost all of them. There was only one case where the C t values in both assays were equal indicating a low number of RNA copies (C t about 32). It seems that this variant replicates poorly in the tissues of chickens and its excretion with the faeces is also low. The poorly replicating viruses are unlikely to cause disease symptoms.
