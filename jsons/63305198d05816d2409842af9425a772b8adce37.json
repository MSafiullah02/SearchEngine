[1] [2] [3] The virus rapidly spread throughout China and then to other countries, leading to the declaration of a pandemic from the WHO on March 11, 2020. 4 We have learned from earlier pandemics, most recently H1N1 influenza in 2009, 5 that swift actions and preparation are critical for ensuring the best outcomes for patients and providers. In addition to public health interventions, such as social distancing, responsible handwashing, and sheltering in place to reduce the number of people infected, healthcare systems are preparing for extreme surges in the number of critically ill patients involved, given estimates that up to 20% of infected patients will require hospitalization and the in-hospital mortality rate could be as high as 28%. 6 The initial response to COVID-19 focused on containment; however, once there was known community transmission in the US, it was clear that this rapidly evolving pandemic would have a broad impact on clinical care and healthcare resources. The American College of Surgeons and the US Surgeon General recommended the reduction of surgical volume in anticipation of further spread of COVID-19. 7, 8 However, operational guidance with regard to how to prioritize patients, staff surgical services, and protect our surgical workforce in the operating room was left for local groups to determine.",

Community spread (ie COVID-19 developing in patients without travel exposure) came to light in Northern California on February 27, 2020, when a patient who had no noted COVID-19 exposure was diagnosed with COVID-19. This patient was treated in Sacramento, CA, about 75 miles north of UCSF. In this case, diagnosis was delayed and the patient was hospitalized for several days before being tested for COVID-19. Documented community spread in our area served as a bellwether, after which our health system developed an accelerated COVID-19 mitigation and surge plan. In parallel, our local government also responded swiftly, with the 5 counties in the San Francisco Bay Area initiating shelter-in-place orders, which went into effect on March 16, 2020 and are currently in place until May 1, 2020.",

This Taskforce developed a surge algorithm that was divided into 3 tiers driven by the number of COVID-19-positive patients both in the San Francisco area and at UCSF Health System, as well as staff shortages (Fig. 2) . On March 5, 2020, perioperative services and surgery representatives were added to the COVID-19 Surge Planning Taskforce after it was recognized that adjusting perioperative care would be a crucial step in managing available resources, including hospital beds, ventilators, blood products, and PPE.",

By March 13, 2020, it was apparent that the COVID-19 pandemic would drastically affect all 3 missions of the department, which include clinical care; fellow, resident and student education; and scientific research. To implement what would need to be drastic changes to the function of the department, a larger council was formed that encompassed all of the division chiefs (cardiothoracic, pediatric, plastic, transplantation, vascular, and general surgery, which includes the sections of gastrointestinal, endocrine, breast, colorectal, and surgical oncology), the vice chairs of education, research, faculty affairs, and diversity equity and inclusion, as well as the residency program leadership. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, there was a constant stream of new information, often leading to considerable fear and confusion. As a result, all meetings were changed from in-person to video conferences, and the Department replaced weekly grand rounds with relevant COVID-19 updates. The first COVID-19 grand rounds was presented by UCSF Division of Infectious Diseases on March 18, 2020, followed by weekly town halls on key COVID-19-related topics, including PPE, revised operating room protocols, epidemiology underpinning of a pandemic, and prediction modeling. Weekly digests from the Department of Surgery were sent to all faculty, staff, and learners to augment daily notifications coming from the health system and/or School of Medicine and to address surgery-specific issues.",

This was initially accomplished by not permitting additional cases to be added to the schedule for March 2 through 15, 2020.

All surgeons were required to document the status of new patients needing operations and patients already scheduled for operations, which has since become a routine part of case scheduling in the electronic health record. As we saw critical healthcare shortages in countries such as Italy and China, a more structured triage process was implemented. Elective surgical cases were prioritized by urgency, which was determined based on the following criteria: anticipated outcomes of delaying operation, such a disease progression; options for alternative nonsurgical treatment; and anticipated resource use (blood, ventilators, ICU, and hospital beds).",

The disaster staffing plan identified core competencies that would be required to maintain basic general and cardiovascular services at the hospital, as well as the candidate faculty and fellows who could provide those services. This core group was preserved for the Department of Surgery and those faculty who were not comfortable providing those services were identified as potential faculty to redeploy to other work areas, such as the inpatient units and emergency department. This strategy was developed across all 3 main sites the department faculty staffdZuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco VA Medical Center, and UCSF Health. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital is the only Level I trauma center for the entire county. Therefore, core faculty from the other sites, not normally on the trauma service, who were comfortable with trauma, were identified and credentialed at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital in the event of a major workforce shortage. Fellows were planned to be redeployed as faculty.

The Department of Surgery requested and received representation on all COVID-19 working committees (ie PPE, virtual communication, clinical, and COVID-19 hospital planning), and became a resource for the greater surgical community with regard to details around the rationale for the recommendations, as well as the basics of COVID-19 (ie symptoms, employee-screening process, and testing approach). Importantly, the leadership group rapidly facilitated addressing the department's questions (such as management of COVID-19-positive faculty) with the local experts when needed. This was essential in a very complex and rapidly changing landscape to dispel falsehoods, address real concerns, and escalate issues to hospital leadership. 8, [15] [16] [17] In addition, as part of all communication, including phone calls, grand rounds, and town halls, trust was emphasized. Surgeons are notoriously competitive, but we emphasized that in this time of uncertainty, we are all in this together and we need to develop a new level of trust with our colleagues, in both our small (section and division) and larger (department and campus site) communities. For example, within divisions, because of the restricted hospital-based staffing, some patients were reassigned to other surgeons who had similar skill sets. Throughout the department, it was essential that there was a level of trust between providers that everyone was prioritizing what was right for the patients and staying within the parameters of the case triage system. Time was too short to review every case at an institutional level.",

Today, most academic departments encompass faculty that perform operations at many hospitals. As a department comes together in a crisis like this, it is essential that the leadership is sensitive to the unique policies and microenvironments in which our faculty and learners practice. For us, this was highlighted with the PPE policy. UCSF Health was a day or 2 ahead of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco VA Medical Center with regard to PPE use standardization. This caused a sense of inequity and concern around potentially increased exposure for faculty based at the latter 2 sites. After this lesson learned, when developing a guideline around the use of laparoscopy in the era of COVID-19, the leadership team was sensitive to develop one that would work in all 3 practice environments, where there are variations in supplies, equipment, and vendors.",

With the healthcare landscape changing in the setting of daily (even hourly) updates to our understanding of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that we come together as a surgical community to efficiently disseminate high-quality information based on experience and data.

Dashboards have been developed to transparently monitor the backlog of patients awaiting surgical treatment. It is anticipated that working through this backlog will be complex as COVID-19 anxiety continues to heighten and evolve. Even today, many patients are uncertain whether they should undergo a lifesaving operation with the concomitant risk of acquiring COVID-19 in the hospital; payors are questioning the need for operations; and staff are constantly assessing their workplace risk. The future is uncertain and with no signs of abatement, understanding the repercussions of our actions and the COVID-19 on surgery will be critical in the learning process.",
