In the same year, e-commerce sales accounted for 41.6% of all retail sales growth [15]. For some entertainment products such as movies, books, and music, online retailers have long outperformed traditional in-store retailers. One of the driving forces of this success is the ability of online retailers to collect purchase histories of customers, online shopping behavior, and reviews of products for a very large number of users. This data is driving several machine learning applications in online retail, of which personalized recommendation is the most important one. With recommender systems online retailers can provide personalized product recommendations and anticipate purchasing behavior.\n",

The latter was coined sentiment analysis and is concerned with machine learning approaches that map written text to scores. Nevertheless, even the best sentiment analysis methods cannot help in determining which new products a costumer might be interested in. The obvious reason is that costumer reviews are not available for products they have not purchased yet.",

Some of these novel methods extend latent factor models to leverage review text by employing an explicit mapping from text to either user or item factors. At prediction time, these models predict product ratings based on some operation (typically the dot product) applied to the user and product representations. Sentiment analysis, however, is usually applied to some representation (e.g. bag-of-words) of review text but in a recommender system scenario the review is not available at prediction time.\n",

TransRev learns vector representations for users, items, and reviews jointly. The crucial advantage of TransRev is that the review embedding is learned such that it corresponds to a translation that moves the embedding of the reviewing user to the embedding of the item the review is about. This allows TransRev to approximate a review embedding at test time as the difference of the item and user embedding despite the absence of a review from the user for that item. The approximated review embedding is then used in the sentiment analysis model to predict the review score. Moreover, the approximated review embedding can be used to retrieve reviews in the training set deemed most similar by a distance measure in the embedding space. These retrieved reviews could be used for several purposes. For instance, such reviews could be provided to users as a starting point for a review, lowering the barrier to writing reviews.",

Given the user and item embeddings, and without further constraints, it allows to distinctively compute the approximate review embedding via Eq. (6). Another popular knowledge graph embedding method is DistMult [16]. In applying such modeling assumption to this problem one would obtain the approximate review embedding by solving the following optimization problem: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{\\mathbf {h}}_{\\mathtt {rev}_{\\mathtt {(u,i)}}} = \\max _{\\mathbf {h}} (\\mathbf {e}_{\\mathtt {i}} \\circ \\mathbf {e}_{\\mathtt {u}}) \\mathbf {h}$$\\end{document}, where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\circ $$\\end{document} is the element-wise multiplication. The solution to that problem would be any vector with infinite norm. Therefore, one should impose constraints in the norm of the embeddings to obtain a non-trivial solution. However, previous work [11] shows that such constraint harms performance. Similarly, most of the knowledge graph embedding methods would require to impose constraints in the norm of the embeddings. The translation modeling assumption of TransE facilitates the approximation of the review embedding without additional constraints, while its performance is on par with, if not better, than most of all other translation-based knowledge graph embedding methods [11].",

            "text": "The first research theme related to TransRev is knowledge graph completion. In the last years, many embedding-based methods have been proposed to infer missing relations in knowledge graphs based on a function that computes a likelihood score based on the embeddings of entities and relation types. Due to its simplicity and good performance, there is a large body of work on translation-based scoring functions [5, 13]. [14] propose an approach to large-scale sequential sales prediction that embeds items into a transition space where user embeddings are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. The associated optimization problem is formulated as a sequential Bayesian ranking problem [28]. To the best of our knowledge, [14] is the first work in leveraging ideas from knowledge graph completion methods for recommender system. Whereas TransRev addresses the problem of rating prediction by incorporating review text, [14] addresses the different problem of sequential recommendation. Therefore the experimental comparison to that work is not possible. In TransRev the review embedding translates the user embedding to the product embedding. In [14], the user embedding translates a product embedding to the embedding of the next purchased product. Moreover, TransRev gets rid of the margin-based loss (and consequently of the negative sampling) due to the joint optimization of Eqs. (2) and (4), whereas [14] is formalized as a ranking problem in a similar way to [5]. Subsequently, there has been additional work on translation-based models in recommender systems [25, 33]. However, these works cannot incorporate users\u2019 feedback other than ratings into the learning, which has been shown to boost performance [21].",

The methods differ in the unsupervised objectives, some of which are tailored to a specific domain.

Second, we compute a 2-dimensional representation of the words by applying t-SNE [20] to the 16-dimensional word embeddings learned by TransRev. Figure 4 depicts these 2-dimensional word embedding vectors learned for the Amazon Beauty data set. The corresponding rating scores are indicated by the color.",

We then retrieve the review text with the most similar review embedding. We investigate the quality of the tentative reviews that TransRev retrieves for the Beauty and Digital Music data sets. The example reviews listed in Table 3 show that while the overall sentiment is correct in most cases, we can also observe the following shortcomings: (a) The function f chosen in our work is invariant to word ordering and, therefore, cannot learn that bigrams such as \u201cnot good\" have a negative meaning. (b) Despite matching the overall sentiment, the actual and retrieved review can refer to different aspects of the product (for example, \u201cit clumps\u201d and \u201cgives me headaches\u201d). Related work [37] extracts aspects from reviews by applying a number of grammatical and morphological analysis tools. These aspects are used later on to explain why the model suspects that a user might be interested in a certain product. We think this type of explanation is complementary to ours, and might inspire future work. (c) Reviews can be specific to a single product. A straightforward improvement could consist of retrieving only existing reviews for the specific product under consideration.\n",
