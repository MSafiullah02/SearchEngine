A unique conjugate (one for each of the three pathogens) was then added to the relevant wells for each sample and the plate was held at room temperature for 30 min. Following a final wash, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for a further 10 min. A stop solution (0.5 mol/L H2SO4) was added and the optical densities were measured at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Labsystems Multiscan Biochromatic; Labsystems, Basingstoke, UK). The ELISA reader optical density data was transformed, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, to calculate the sample to positive (S/P) ratios.

The assay described by Decaro et al.\n15\n was compared with our TaqMan\u2010based assay and produced very similar results, but the assay used here sometimes had slightly higher analytical sensitivity (Kirkland, unpubl. data) Guiterrez\u2010Aguierre et al. were the first to describe a real\u2010time TaqMan qRT\u2010PCR for the detection of both human and animal rotaviruses.\n22\n Both the rotavirus and coronavirus qRT\u2010PCR assays used in the present study were found to be invaluable and provided the capacity for relative quantification of the amount of viral RNA in the samples. Evidence of high viral load in samples tested using qRT\u2010PCR gives the clinician more confidence that the virus identified is likely to be involved in the disease process. This does not exclude the possibility that lower concentrations of RNA may be significant, as the concentration can be influenced by factors such as the stage of disease, the quality of the sample collected and appropriate storage and handling during transport. The RNA extraction and qRT\u2010PCR technologies used also allow large numbers of samples to be tested in a short time and, as a result of the relatively low labour input, can be conducted at much lower cost than conventional RT\u2010PCR.",

The qRT\u2010PCR assays for rotavirus and coronavirus both detected a higher proportion of positive faecal samples. Similar findings have been reported by others comparing qRT\u2010PCR and ELISA, and were not unexpected.\n22\n Although it is possible that the discrepant results were related to false positives in the qRT\u2010PCR assays, we consider that this is unlikely, especially considering the high viral load detected in some of the samples. Further, it is known that, for rotavirus, qRT\u2010PCR\u2010positive/ELISA\u2010negative samples in this study did contain viral RNA as demonstrated by further sub\u2010typing PCR assays (Kirkland, unpubl. obs.).",

Contradicting this argument, a proportion of the ELISA\u2010negative/qRT\u2010PCR\u2010positive samples had low Ct values, indicating a high viral load. However, the different analytes that are detected by these assays should not be overlooked and it is possible that the relatively stable double\u2010stranded RNA of rotavirus may persist under adverse conditions for longer than the protein viral antigens. The rotavirus ELISA assay used in this study targeted the VP7 outer capsule protein. Degradation of the outer virion protein has been described as a cause of false negatives in rotavirus ELISA assays,\n27\n and stabilisation of the outer capsid can be achieved by including calcium chloride.\n28\n False\u2010negative results may also reflect the presence of complexing antibodies, high concentrations of faecal material, decreased affinity of detecting antibodies or the presence of proteases.\n5\n, \n9\n, \n21\n, \n29\n, \n30\n\n",

According to the manufacturer (Bio\u2010X\u00ae Diagnostics; Jemelle, Belgium), the reported sensitivity and specificity of the rotavirus LAT when tested against double\u2010stranded RNA electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel was 96% and 100%, respectively.

The higher prevalence of rotavirus infection in the population sampled provided for a higher positive predictive value (81.4%) of the rotavirus LAT when compared with qRT\u2010PCR, but given the high population prevalence and prior probability of infection, the test provided little additional diagnostic information. The negative predictive value of the rotavirus assay was also extremely low (8.9%) when compared with qRT\u2010PCR, providing essentially no diagnostic value. Recently, Klein et al. evaluated a commercial rotavirus and coronavirus dipstick using faeces from 180 calves (98 with diarrhoea) aged 1\u201342 days against a RT\u2010PCR assay.\n38\n The coronavirus assay in that study showed a greater sensitivity (60%), specificity (96.4%), positive (91.3%) and negative predictive values (79.1%) than the coronavirus LAT assay examined in our study.

Further studies are warranted to develop a better understanding of the clinical relevance of the different levels of viral RNA detected by qRT\u2010PCR assays.
