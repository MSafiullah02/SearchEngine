Pathogens were identified in 1031 patients; of these, 725 and 306 were bacterial and viral cases, respectively. Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella were the dominant bacteria, and Caliciviridae and Reoviridae were the dominant viral families in the local area. The acute gastroenteritis epidemic peaks appeared in August and January, which represented the active peak periods of bacteria and viruses, respectively. Logistic regression analyses with sex stratification showed that abdominal pain, fever and ingestion of unsafe food at restaurants were independent factors more frequently associated with bacterial gastroenteritis irrespective of sex; red cell-positive fecal matter was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.28 only in males; and white blood cell count was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an OR of 1.02 only in females. Pathogen stratification showed that age, vomiting and red cell-positive fecal matter were associated with males with ORs of 0.99, 0.61 and 1.71, respectively, in bacterial gastroenteritis; and the migrant ratio was higher in males with an OR of 2.29 only in viral gastroenteritis. In conclusion, although bacterial and viral gastroenteritis shared many features, epidemiological and clinical factors differed between sexes and pathogens.",

Although viral gastroenteritis manifests abruptly with vomiting and watery diarrhea, often accompanied by low-grade fever and abdominal cramps, these clinical manifestations are always shared by bacterial gastroenteritis 6-8 . Thus, further evaluation of differences in sex, infection source, transmission route, symptoms as well as clinical laboratory tests between viral and bacterial gastroenteritis has clinical significance. In addition, Shanghai is an international metropolis that had 24.2 million residents and 320 million tourists in the year of 2017, and high population density is a major factor promoting acute gastroenteritis epidemics 2,3,9-12 . So far, long-term acute gastroenteritis surveillance data with a large sample size from Shanghai are still scarce.

Bacterial detection is a vital part of the acute gastroenteritis control and prevention strategy established by the local health administration department. Bacterial identification is the systematic work of a multisectoral collaboration in China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it is difficult to detail all processes in this report. Briefly, detection was carried out via classic bacterial isolation, culture, and identification in combination with molecular diagnostic strategies 2 . In addition, bacterial samples were subjected to VITEK \u00ae 2 Compact (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) for simultaneous microbial identification. The above technologies covered the most common diarrhea-related bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio parahemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and others 2 . To learn the pathotypes of diarrheagenic E. coli, suspected E. coli colonies on SMAC or MacConkey plates were further analyzed by PCR using primers targeting the genes eae, bfp, stx1, stx2, ipaH, pCDV, eltA and estA. A first PCR detection was performed with stx1/ stx2 and eae primers focusing on the identification of STEC or EPEC. Positive eae and negative stx1/stx2 samples were then examined by PCR with bfp primers to differentiate tEPEC from aEPEC. Negative eae and stx1/stx2 samples were further screened by PCR using pCVD432 primers for plasmidic EAEC sequences, ipaH primers for detecting invasion plasmid antigen genes of EIEC, and detection of the eltA and estA genes of ETEC labile and stable enterotoxins 18, 19 . The diagnosis of epidemic dysentery and cholera was performed according to the Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization 5 .",

Detection of viral pathogens. Viral detection is another vital part of the acute gastroenteritis control and prevention strategy established by the local health administration department. Gastroenteritis virus detection was performed according to methods reported by other peers 2,10,12,20,21 . Briefly, fecal specimens were prepared as 10% (w/v) suspensions in distilled water and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10000 g in a 1.5 ml collection tube www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (Biovisualab, Shanghai, China) to remove debris. Viral DNA and viral RNA were extracted from the suspensions using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The virus panel was established with routine diarrhea surveillance data that were accumulated by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by reference to information from peers [20] [21] [22] [23] . Rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, mimiviruses, aichivirus, bocavirus, parechovirus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, coronaviruses, picornaviruses, toroviruses, and other enteroviruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR using primer sets, as reported previously 2,10,12,20-23 . Statistical analysis. Continuous variables are presented as the means \u00b1 standard deviations (SDs); differences between groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies (percentage); differences in frequencies were evaluated using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact probability test. To identify independent factors and to distinguish factors associated with pathogen or sex, logistic regression analyses were applied in 1031 subjects with known pathogens. To identify factors that tended to be associated with pathogens, the dependent variables were defined as viral case = 0 and bacterial case = 1, and the multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed by sex. To identify factors that tended to be associated with sex, the dependent variables were defined as female = 0 and male = 1, and the multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed by viral and bacterial gastroenteritis. Potential independent variables were selected by univariate analyses; factors with P < 0.10 were introduced into the starting model of the multivariable logistic regression analyses and then eliminated manually using the backward step-by-step approach, depending on the largest p-value. All analyses were performed using SPSS software for Windows (ver. 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and the significance level (alpha) was set at 0.05.",

The noninflammatory gastroenteritis is mostly caused by viral infection with milder disease; while, inflammatory gastroenteritis is more severe and always resulted from infection of invasive or with toxin-producing bacteria 1,24-26 . In addition, fever and abdominal pain are two common symptoms in acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella infection 24 ; our data showed that 22.2% identified bacterial cases were Salmonella infection (Fig. 2) . Thus, higher prevalence of fever and abdominal pain in acute bacterial gastroenteritis were observed. Ingesting unsafe food at restaurants was a common transmission route for both sexes and was more frequently associated with bacterial gastroenteritis; which is consistent with that bacterial infections are more often associated with foodborne transmission [24] [25] [26] and acquired easily at places with high population mobility 27, 28 .

In bacterial gastroenteritis, age and vomiting were associated with males with ORs of 0.99 and 0.61, respectively; for ease of understanding, these associations were translated to females, and age and vomiting were associated with females with ORs of 1.01 and 1.64, respectively, meaning that with a 1-year old increase, the female/male ratio will increase 1.01 times, and vomiting is more frequently associated with female patients. The age quartiles of female and male bacterial cases are 27.6, 36.9 and 57.2; and 28.1, 34.9 and 49.9 years old respectively; the 2 nd and particularly the 3 rd quartiles of female age were older; which is why female/male ratio will increase 1.01 times with a 1-year old increase. Red cell-positive fecal matter remained an independent factor that was more frequently observed in males with OR of 1.71 (Table 4 ); in addition, the above sex stratification analysis showed that red cell-positive fecal matter was an independent factor that was more frequently observed in bacterial cases only in males with OR of 3.28 (Table 3) . These two analysis methods mutually confirmed that red cell-positive fecal matter is common in males with bacterial infections. Bacteria, such as Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella, predisposing to cause inflammatory infections with bloody stool [24] [25] [26] , which could be used to explain why bloody stool is more frequently observed in bacterial infections, but could not interpret gender difference. Since the proportions of Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella infections were similar between males (49.9% and 52.5%) and females (50.1% and 47.5%), higher bloody stool rate in male cases should not be caused by differences in rates of bacterial infection. Although we could not give a reasonable explanation to partial gender differences; these evidences have clinical significance and will guide translational study to interpret a pathological mechanism. In fact, gender differences exist widely in clinical medicine and have been paid more and more attention in recent years 30 . In viral cases, only domiciliary register remained an independent factor associated with males; the migrant/local resident ratio was 2.29 times higher in males than in females, suggesting the prevalence of viral gastroenteritis is relatively higher in migrant workers.",

            "text": "Acute gastroenteritis caused by viral infections was dominated by rotavirus and norovirus 31, 32 . Rotavirus always causes severe gastroenteritis in young children 33, 34 , while norovirus causes most outbreaks of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis in all age groups 35 . Recently, some scholars reported that the rotavirus predominance of acute gastroenteritis has been replaced by norovirus due to the wide implementation of rotavirus vaccination 9 . Our data showed that Caliciviridae (norovirus GII and GI) and Reoviridae (rotavirus A) constituted more than 80% of viral infections. Since a norovirus vaccine is still under development 36 , rotavirus vaccination needs to be implemented in local areas. Bacteria are the second leading cause of acute gastroenteritis; Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli, pathogenic Vibrio, Yersinia, and Clostridium difficile are the most commonly reported bacteria correlated with acute gastroenteritis 1,2 . Our data showed that Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella were the dominant bacteria identified in the local area, and these findings are consistent with those of a previous study with a small sample size 2 .",

Second, based on our sampling rates, pathogens were only identified in 9.2% (1031/11243) of patients, and more effort should be made to improve the representative accuracy of our results. Third, in the stratified and logistic regression analyses, we only considered mixed viral cases and mixed bacterial cases and did not subgroup the subjects by bacterial classification, virus classification or by multiple infections due to the restrictions of sample size. Since all of the above factors might influence the symptoms and clinical examinations of acute gastroenteritis, our analyses may be influenced by related bias.",
