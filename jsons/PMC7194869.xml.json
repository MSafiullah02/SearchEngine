Several models have been developed to study the potential trajectories of resource use during this pandemic. Although these models focus on acute care resources, they provide a reliable resource to help predict the range of potential impacts on the post-acute care sector as well. Using the total number of inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in Ontario, Barret et al.\n8 have examined three potential scenarios (Figure 2\n). In the worst-case scenario, which assumes a growth rate of 33% in daily cases (similar to that in Italy), the number of available hospital beds in Ontario could fall to 0 by early-to-mid April 2020, without recovery through mid-May. In another scenario, assuming an initial growth rate of 25% in daily cases (similar to that initially seen in Ontario) until the of end March, followed by a 10.74% decrease to account for successful public health measures (school closure, social distancing, testing, and isolation), the maximum impact on inpatient acute hospital care would occur in early April, followed by a sustained recovery. Finally, in a third scenario which assumes an initial 15% daily increase, with a similar subsequent 10.74% decrease, the overall impact would be reduced; however, the timing of patient influx to post-acute care would likely be unchanged. The post-acute care sector will play a key role in alleviating pressures on hospitals; however, these facilities and programs themselves will face challenges as they attempt to reduce care fragmentation.",

Post-acute care facilities will be increasingly challenged by a rising influx of patients with serious, incompletely resolved cardiac problems. Fortunately, as a large country with a significant rural population, Canada has experience with various alternative models for post-acute cardiac care. In fact, several cardiac rehabilitation programs in the country already deliver home-based programs, which have been shown to have similar clinical outcomes, cost, and completion rates compared to clinic-based programs.9 The maximization of these services, in order to treat patients at home, will be an extremely important component of managing resources during COVID-19. To accomplish this, open communication between cardiac rehabilitation centres will be needed for knowledge exchange, allowing centres not currently offering home-based programs to quickly learn from other centres where this practice has been successfully implemented.",

In the context of this pandemic, telehealth technology can be leveraged to reduce the need for in-person care, for apporopriate patients. Specifically, this technology can be applied to patient follow-up after discharge, to perform remote cardiac monitoring, and to administer cardic rehabilitation curriculums remotely. Digital health interventions -such as the Virtual Care Program from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (https://pwc.ottawaheart.ca/programs-services/virtual-care)- provide services such as self-monitoring tools, reminders, and notifications, as well as peer support groups for those undergoing remote curriculums. Healthcare systems that will leverage these technologies to manage the upcoming influx of patients could see a reduction in in-person care needs and be in a better position to serve their patients. These technologies will play a particularly important role in filling gaps present in areas with limited access to current cardiac rehabilitation care.",
