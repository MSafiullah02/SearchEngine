A socio-ecological network consists of intertwined human-centric networks (e.g., a railway network, a public transit system, an air route network) and natural networks (e.g., a river, a conservation corridor, a bird migration route). While operating to primarily serve human needs, these component networks also benefit (or obstruct) other beings, including germs that are detrimental to human health. The coronavirus is only a most recent \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of this kind. As such, the essence of the lockdown strategy is to lock down all the nodes on a socio-ecological network, preventing this deadly virus from transmitting from node to node. When strictly implemented, the strategy should work theoretically; in practice, it did work well in China this time.",

The links and nodes (i.e., corridors and habitats) of an ecological network operate coherently to provide the target species a fitting environment for survival, reproduction, and flourishing. As cities, towns, and even countryside become more urbanized, ecological networks in the traditional sense are increasingly intertwined with human-centric networks\u2014biological, cultural, digital, economic, political, social, and technological\u2014that operate to serve human needs. Together, they form an emergent socio-ecological network whose component networks interact with each other to serve primarily human needs as well as the needs of other beings (e.g., the target species).",

In the past several months since December 2019, it first violently attacked Wuhan, the populous unban center in central China; through an extensive citywide socio-ecological network, it readily ignited a devastating outbreak among the 11 million unprepared people throughout the Three Towns of Wuhan; later via a widespread countrywide socio-ecological network on which Wuhan is a hub, it extended the pernicious assault comfortably to other parts of the country, causing a deadly pandemic among the 1.4 billion people (Fig. 1).2",
