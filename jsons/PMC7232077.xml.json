            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of about 30 kb and a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae (Kocherhans et al., 2001). PEDV can cause an enteric disease (PED) with high mortality of up to 100% in neonatal piglets. There are at least two genogroups with PEDV with classical genogroup 1 and newly emerging genogroup 2 (Huang et al., 2013; Jung and Saif, 2015). Genogroup 1 PEDV has circulated among countries in Europe and Asia since the early 1980s (Huang et al., 2013). In 2010, new highly pathogenic Chinese PEDV strains emerged and classified into Genogroup 2(Li et al., 2012). The first US outbreak with genogroup 2a PEDV occurred in 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013) and subsequently in Canada and Mexico (Anastasia et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Pasma et al., 2016), resulting in the death of 7 million pigs during one year epidemic period (Cima, 2014). Moreover, there are several reports that the US PEDV strains (genogroup 2) caused outbreaks in European (Grasland et al., 2015; Hanke et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2015) and Asian countries (Lee and Lee, 2014; Lin et al., 2014; Van Diep et al., 2015), which raised significant economic and public health concerns worldwide (Schulz and Tonsor, 2015).",

            "text": "Coronavirus genome encodes four major structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (Duarte et al., 1994). Among them, N protein is an abundant structural protein present at all stages of infection. The coronavirus N protein is composed of multiple domains including N1 (or N-terminal domain), N2 (or C-terminal domain) and N3 with spacers between them (Hurst et al., 2013). Both N1 and N2 are very basic and interact with viral RNA genome and/or N protein (Hurst et al., 2013). N3 is the carboxy-terminal part (\u223c45 aa) with an excess of acidic residues and known to interact with M protein (Hurst et al., 2005; Verma et al., 2006). The primary role of N protein is to act as an essential architecture component in coronavirus assembly through the interactions with N, M and viral RNA (Cavanagh and Cavanaugh, 1997). In addition to its primary role, N protein appears to perform multiple functions in the viral replication cycle and pathogenesis (McBride et al., 2014). Some previous research suggests that the N protein correlates with optimal coronavirus RNA transcription and/or replication, by acting as RNA chaperones to assist the template-switching steps (Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2007; Zuniga et al., 2010), and participating in the replicase components for efficient RNA synthesis (Hurst et al., 2013; Hurst et al., 2010). In several studies, N protein was also shown to be involved in host cell signaling and immune responses to facilitate viral replication (Cao et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2013).",

The N protein cleavage was implied for playing roles in efficient viral replication and pathogenicity (Diemer et al., 2008; El\u00e9ou\u00ebt et al., 2000). For PEDV N protein, Jaru-Ampornpan et al. demonstrated that virally-encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) cleaves N protein during virus replication and the cleavage is associated with viral adaptation in cell culture (Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2017). Previously, we reported two forms of N protein from the protease independent PEDV 8aa strain, while only one form from the protease dependent PEDV KD strains (Kim et al., 2017). We hypothesized that the two forms of N protein are generated by a post-translational modification by host or cellular protease(s) during the replication of PEDV 8aa strain. Here, we demonstrated that the N protein of PEDV 8aa strain is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis of Vero cells. The PEDV N protein was cleaved by caspase 6 or 7 between D424 and G425 near the C-terminal of N protein. Furthermore, N protein was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells regardless of N protein cleavage. Our results demonstrated characteristics during the replication of PEDV 8aa, which provides valuable information to understanding the PEDV biology.",

L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin and Leupeptin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Furin inhibitor I was purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Enzo (Farmingdale, NY). Recombinant human Caspase 3 and 6 were purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA) and recombinant caspase 7 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MIN). The synthesis of a coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, was previously described (Tiew et al., 2011).

As shown in Fig. 1B, the N protein cleavage was abolished by the addition of Z-VAD-fmk (36 and 48 hpi). However, furin or trypsin inhibitors did not block N protein cleavage (Data not shown). Because activation of the caspase family plays central roles in cellular apoptosis, we analyzed the occurrence of apoptosis in PEDV infected Vero cells using TUNEL staining and DNA fragmentation assay. At 48 hpi, 8aa infected cells became TUNEL-positive with a typical cellular feature of apoptosis and the percentage of TUNEL-positive 8aa infected cells was 35%, which was statistically significantly higher than that of mock-treated cells, (Fig. 2\nA and B). The treatment of Z-VAD-fmk, however, blocked the progression of apoptosis in 8aa infected cells. KD infected cells started to show cell-to-cell fusion from 12hpi and showed extensive cell-to-cell fusions and syncytium formations at 24hpi, but no TUNEL positive cell was observed at 12 and 24hpi. To confirm the progress of apoptosis in 8aa infected cells, the DNA fragmentation assay was conducted. As expected, the low molecular weight DNA from the 8aa infected Vero cells showed a typical feature of apoptosis, fragmentation of DNA (Fig. 2C), whereas the mock-infected cells did not show any sign of DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of caspase by the addition of Z-VAD-fmk led to significantly increased PEDV 8aa replication compared to mock-treated(DMSO) cells (Fig. 3\n).",

TGEV N protein is cleaved by caspase 6 and 7 during replication in HRT18 cells, which resulted in 22 amino acid fragment from the C-terminal of N protein (El\u00e9ou\u00ebt et al., 2000). SARS-CoV N protein is also cleaved by caspase 6 and potentially by caspase 3, and the possible cleavage site is located at residues 400 and 403 on the C-terminal of N protein (Diemer et al., 2008). The biological significance of the virus-induced apoptosis and N protein cleavages is still unclear, but it is suggested to be involved in the pathogenicity (Diemer et al., 2008; El\u00e9ou\u00ebt et al., 2000). In this study, we demonstrated similar findings to TEGV and SARS mediated apoptosis in protease independent PEDV 8aa strain. The cleaved N band (N\u2019) appeared at the late stage (after 36 hpi) of 8aa infection (Fig. 1A) and required caspase activities because the N\u2019 product was abolished by the addition of pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk) (Fig. 1B). This cleavage was closely associated with the virus-induced apoptosis evident with TUNEL staining and the DNA fragmentation at 48 hpi (Fig. 2). However, the N protein of PEDV KD was barely cleaved during virus replication (Fig. 1A). Because PEDV KD, a trypsin-dependent strain, causes extensive cell fusion formation with lysis at 24hpi without cellular apoptosis(Fig. 2), there were significant differences in the virus-induced cell death by these two different PEDV strains.",

In a host defense point of view, apoptosis curtails the use of cellular machinery necessary for viral protein synthesis and facilitates the elimination of viral proteins through caspase-mediated proteolysis, resulting in the reduction of viral replication and spread (Danthi, 2011; Yan et al., 2010). Thus, viruses in diverse families encode anti-apoptotic proteins (Clem et al., 1991) to limit apoptosis. On the other hand, viruses can take advantage of the apoptosis of host cells to facilitate virus replication. Various viruses have utilized caspases to cleave their viral proteins for successful replication, which is aborted when the caspase cleavage sites on the viral proteins are eliminated (Best et al., 2003; Moody and Laimins, 2009). In this study, the replication of 8aa was slightly but significantly increased in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3), suggesting the apoptosis is not favorable for viruses. Of note, the replication of PEDV KD in the presence of trypsin induced extensive fusions with cell lysis starting 12 hpi, and the addition of Z-VAD-fmk in the medium did not affect virus replication (data not shown).",

Because domain 3 is not involved in N-N interaction and RNA binding, the cleavage may not affect these functions of N protein. However, the cleavage resulted in the reduction of 8aa replication (Fig. 3) probably because domain 3 interacts with M protein to plays an important role in coronavirus replication (Narayanan et al., 2000) and the N cleavage disrupts the N-M interaction. Interestingly, we observed that both forms of N proteins were present in the concentrated (purified) PEDV 8aa virus at the ratio of 1:1 (Kim et al., 2017) suggesting that the cleaved form of N protein could still integrate into virions at the similar rates as the uncleaved form.",

In this study, we used a specific 3CLpro inhibitor (GC376) to investigate whether the N protein of PEDV 8aa is cleaved by 3CLpro or not. The treatment of GC376 did not abolish N protein cleavage for PEDV 8aa (Fig. 6). 3CLpro-mediated N protein cleavage may dependent on the different PEDV strains.",

            "text": "A nucleus localization of N protein has been reported for several coronaviruses including PEDV, TGEV, Murine Hepatitis Virus(MHV), SARS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Diemer et al., 2008; Hiscox et al., 2000; Shi et al., 2014; Wurm et al., 2001). Shi et al. (Shi et al., 2014) reported nuclear localization of PEDV N protein in Vero E6 cells after transfection with N genes. Amino acid 71-90 region sufficiently mediated nuclear localization of the N protein and R87 and R89 were crucial for its function. This 71-90 region is almost conserved N protein of 8aa and KD strains with a single mutation (G84-to-A84). The N protein of 8aa and KD also poses two potential nuclear localization signals (NLS) that are composed of \u201cpat 7\u201d NLS sequences at 261-PKKNKSR-267 and 381-PQRKKEK-387. However, during the examination of Vero cells with 8aa, KD infection or N transfection using confocal microscopy, N proteins were exclusively localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7). he cytoplasmic localization of N protein was consistently shown when it was examined at different time points for both PEDV 8aa and KD (data not shown). It is possible a minor population of N protein (with or without N protein cleavage) may be localized to the nucleus, and there could be variations among strains. To further elucidate the functional role of N protein and its cleavage, we are currently investigating the cleaved (and uncleaved) N protein in viral assembly and replication.",
