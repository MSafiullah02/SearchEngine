            "text": "The A(H1N1) 2009 influenza pandemic brought into focus the need for reliable estimates of mortality associated with seasonal influenza in order to be able to assess the potential impact of the pandemic. Several factors need to be accounted for when such estimates are being made. The diagnosis of influenza is usually based on typical symptoms and signs, rather than laboratory confirmation [1], and other viruses may ultimately be the causative agent, such as respiratory syncytial virus [1\u20134]. Furthermore, since death from influenza frequently results from secondary bacterial pneumonia or a general deterioration due to pre-existing cardio-respiratory diseases [1, 5\u20137], the preceding influenza-like-illness either is not suspected as an underlying cause of death or is simply not mentioned on the death notification. As a consequence, estimates of influenza-associated mortality have usually been made on the basis of excess mortality from all-causes, respiratory and circulatory diseases, or pneumonia and influenza [1, 2, 8\u201311]. The use of these surrogate measures can be confounded by excess mortality that tends to occur during the colder months of the year [12], in particular for deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which may result from extreme climatic conditions or changes in temperature [13, 14].",

This translates into an average of about 36,000 deaths per year. Estimates from other countries have varied according to the underlying cause of death chosen (all-causes, respiratory and circulatory diseases, or pneumonia and influenza causes of deaths). The estimate was similar in Hong Kong, where the average annual excess death rate associated with influenza was estimated at 12.4 per 100,000 based on cardio-respiratory conditions [2].",

Influenza virus circulates mainly in the winter months during which time temperatures are low; thus, some deaths attributed to influenza may in fact be related to the lower temperatures during the winter [12\u201314]. When computing the influenza-associated mortality rates, we deducted average excess mortality in two baseline years with little influenza activity in order to remove the effect of winter mortality unrelated to influenza. However, during those \u201cbaseline\u201d years, there was also some influenza activity. Thus, we may have underestimated the excess influenza mortality. We used the underlying cause of death reported in the death notifications, as has been used by other researchers [1, 2, 24, 25]. The use of information on multiple causes of death could produce more accurate estimates, since the analysis would be less sensitive to coding choices for the underlying cause of death, as suggested by Dushoff et al. [18]. However, multiple causes of death data were not available.",

While the estimates vary from year to year, the averages are strikingly similar to those obtained for the USA. In general, about 90% of influenza-associated deaths, from respiratory and circulatory diseases, occur in the age group 65+ years, and about 1% in the age group <50 years. This information underscores the major impact of the 2009 pandemic on the age group <50 years, and the importance of targeting the correct population for influenza vaccination programs. Deaths related to seasonal influenza were negligible among people <50 years, and although some countries recommend vaccinating this group, it should be emphasized that the vaccine will not have a significant impact on mortality; rather, it will have an effect on morbidity, preventing other age groups from being infected with the disease, and an economic impact (this group includes the working force of a community).",
