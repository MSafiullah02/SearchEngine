Unlike bacteria, fungi, and parasites which are capable of independent growth, the viruses require the host cell for the multiplication. Whenever there is a state of misfunctioning of any immune components because of genetic defects or because of acquired disease as acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) caused by human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2), the immune system is not able to respond naturally to infectious agents.

The symptoms are due to potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, which affects relaxation of muscles causing muscle spasms.

In most patients with genital HPV, the infection is asymptomatic, subclinical, or unrecognized. The disease may be diagnosed by clinical assessment or biopsy of the lesion.
