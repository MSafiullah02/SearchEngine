Therefore, your fear of dying should be tempered with facts. Most importantly, as a physician who cited the Hippocratic oath at graduation, you have sworn to solemnly serve your patient as your first consideration before your own interests.3 You are therefore ethically (because of professionalism, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, and dignity) and morally bound to perform your duty when called upon, especially in a medical crisis, as we are presently living through. Additionally, there is an American Academy of Dermatology Code of Medical Ethics that states, \u201cIt is \u2026unethical for a dermatologist \u2026to refuse the management of a patient because of medical risk, real or imagined (page 18, section 1C).\u201d4 Subsequently, in the current pandemic, it is a dermatologist's duty to treat patients in the clinic, in the hospital, in the emergency room, and in the intensive care unit if called upon.",

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, reports of exponential increases of confirmed cases; the rising death toll; and limited resources for testing, treatment, and personal protective equipment can cause an overwhelming sense of anxiety, even for health care workers. Health care workers in Italy make up approximately 9% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in that country as of March 10, 2020.5 There is no question that physicians are at high risk of exposure and infection. However, as already noted, the cases of infection in adults younger than 65 years have been less severe, resulting in significantly fewer intensive care unit admissions and case fatality rates in the United States, ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 in patients 20 to 44 years old.6 Thus, you need to behave professionally and do whatever is required in our joint effort to mitigate this outbreak.",
