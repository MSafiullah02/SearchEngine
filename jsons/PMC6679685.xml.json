The subjects included in the study were patients with laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) infection diagnosed from 1 April 2013 to 1 March 2017. The study subjects were expanded from the cohort of 288 hospitalized A(H7N9)-infected patients with pneumonia during April 2013\u2013March 2015 that was previously analyzed to assess the impact of corticosteroids upon mortality and A(H7N9) shedding [20]. The electronic medical records of patients were sent to a data collection center in Beijing, China. Demographic data, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings at admission, virological test results, and treatments were reviewed by a trained team of physicians and medical students and entered in duplicate into a computerized database. As noted previously, the collection of data from A(H7N9)-infected patients was determined to comprise public health surveillance in China, and institutional review board assessment was waived [20, 21].",

To identify risk factors associated with prolonged duration of A(H7N9) RNA shedding, we performed a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for baseline covariates.

For this analysis, we censored patients if they never cleared A(H7N9) RNA or, if they were discharged alive before they had cleared A(H7N9) RNA, at hospital discharge. Analysis was performed using a marginal structural Cox proportional hazard model [23]. Candidate variables considered for analysis of prolonged duration of A(H7N9) shedding were sex, age, comorbidities, smoking, time from illness onset to starting antiviral treatment, and specific antiviral NAI. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the cumulative A(H7N9) RNA\u2013negativity rate and the stratified log-rank statistic to compare the difference of A(H7N9) clearance between different 2 groups (ie, patients who survivors vs those who died, patients who started NAI treatment <5 days from illness onset vs those who started NAI treatment \u22655 days from illness onset, patients who received oseltamivir vs those who received a combination of oseltamivir plus peramivir, and patients who received standard-dose oseltamivir vs those who received double-dose oseltamivir).

A systematic review reported that progressively longer shedding duration of A(H1N1)pdm09 in patients was correlated with disease severity when studies were stratified into community (range of mean and median values, 2\u20139 days), hospital (range of mean and median values, 6\u201310 days), and intensive care (range of mean and median values, 13\u201320 days) settings [18].

In addition, our previous observational study that used propensity-score matching showed that use of high-dose corticosteroids was associated with a fatal outcome among patients with pneumonia and A(H7N9) infection [20]. Our results are in accordance with the above findings that corticosteroid treatment, not only high-dose corticosteroid dosing, is associated with prolonged viral shedding duration and that prolonged viral shedding is associated with a fatal outcome.

Hu et al [28] reported the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant virus with the Arg292Lys (R292K) mutation in the gene encoding viral neuraminidase in 2 A(H7N9)-infected patients during NAI treatment, which was temporally associated with a rebound in the A(H7N9) load and treatment failure. The R292K mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir and highly reduced inhibition to peramivir and zanamivir in vitro, suggesting that NAI treatment would not be effective in treating infection with viruses containing the R292K mutation. Of concern, the prevalence of the R292K mutation has increased since the first human infections with A(H7N9), in 2013, and was reported to be approximately 11% among sequenced viruses from A(H7N9)-infected patients during the fifth epidemic [4]. Recently, Ke et al [29] described the detection of the R292K mutation as early as 2 days after starting oseltamivir treatment in a patient with highly pathogenic A(H7N9) infection.",

            "text": "Our study is the first to assess the impact of different NAI regimens, including combination treatment, and different dosages of oseltamivir on viral shedding and clinical outcome in patients with A(H7N9) infection. Our finding that double-dose oseltamivir did not provide an additional virologic benefit as compared to standard-dose oseltamivir treatment is consistent with results from controlled trials in outpatients [30] and inpatients with seasonal influenza [31] and from observational studies in hospitalized patients with A(H5N1) [32] or A(H1N1)pdm09 [33] infections. Previous studies suggested reasons for these observations [31, 34]. Oseltamivir is generally well absorbed and rapidly converted to the active compound, oseltamivir carboxylate, with a bioavailability of >80% [35]. Blood concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate associated with single- or double-dose therapy in patients with influenza both exceed the median inhibitory concentration (ie, 0.7\u20132.2 ng/mL [36]) of influenza viruses. Exceeding these concentrations might not produce additional clinical or virological effect [37]. In addition, it may be that delayed antiviral treatment, when severe disease is already present, may reduce any potential benefit of double-dose oseltamivir. A retrospective analysis from a limited number of patients with A(H7N9) infection reported that oseltamivir plus peramivir was not superior to oseltamivir monotherapy in clinical or virological outcomes [38]. Clinical data, including a randomized trial of combination oseltamivir and zanamivir treatment, compared with either monotherapy alone, for seasonal influenza have not substantiated a potential advantage in using combinations of NAIs [30]. Rather, the data appear consistent in showing that use of combinations that target the same protein do not show an additive or synergistic effect against influenza virus infection [39].",

Second, not all of the patients with laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) infection in mainland China could be included in this study. However, we were able to include patients managed at 96 different hospitals. Third, owing to the small number of patients who initiated NAI treatment 2\u20133 days of illness onset, we were not able to assess the effect of early versus later initiation of NAI treatment. Fourth, genetic sequencing was not performed on specimens from patients with prolonged duration of A(H7N9) RNA shedding, to assess the frequency of emergence of antiviral resistance. It was therefore not possible to analyze the relationship between antiviral resistance and prolonged A(H7N9) shedding. Since paired upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were not collected prospectively from all patients, we could not directly compare differences in viral shedding between upper (ie, nasopharyngeal swab specimens) versus lower (endotracheal aspirates) respiratory tract specimens. However, we did not find any significant difference in the duration of A(H7N9) shedding between nasopharyngeal swab specimens and endotracheal aspirates.",

These results reinforce guidance that NAI treatment should be started as soon as possible in patients with suspected A(H7N9) infection and suggest that corticosteroids should be avoided except in clinical situations where they have proven benefit. Although a prospective, randomized, controlled study is needed to definitely assess the clinical and virologic benefit of combination NAI therapy or higher dosing of oseltamivir, our findings in this observational study suggest that there is no benefit of higher oseltamivir dosing or use of multiple NAIs for treatment of A(H7N9)-infected patients. The increased frequency of emergence of resistance to NAIs during treatment and the high case-fatality proportion indicate an urgent need for improved antiviral treatment strategies, including drugs with different mechanisms of action than NAIs or those used in combination with NAIs, in hospitalized patients with A(H7N9) infection. Ideally, when available, new drugs should be evaluated in the context of randomized, controlled trials in A(H7N9)-infected patients.",
