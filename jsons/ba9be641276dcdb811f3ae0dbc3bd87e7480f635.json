All suspect and confirmed cases seen were admitted for purposes of isolation to airborne infection isolation rooms, in line with a national containment strategy to limit community transmission. As the number of cases requiring admission increased, there was a need to develop a triaging algorithm to determine who could be discharged pending a confirmatory result. We describe a Swab-and-Send-Home (\"SASH\") strategy implemented on 7 February during this outbreak that has helped to reduce hospital admissions.",

In the SASH group, one nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was taken immediately. Patients were sent home with surgical mask, standard advisory to observe personal hygiene, given seven days of hospitalization leave and asked to return if unwell. A clinic appointment five to seven days later was scheduled if SASH patients had acute respiratory illness with travel to areas of heightened vigilance or other countries with outbreaks, close contact with confirmed cases, prolonged ARI or visits to other hospitals overseas without pneumonia. No appointments were given for low risk patients. If the PCR result was positive, the patient was recalled immediately for direct admission to NCID. If the PCR result was negative, clinicians conducted a tele-health consult with patient via phone call after 4 to 6 days to assess resolution or persistence of symptoms. If symptoms had improved or resolved, and no other reasons for medical review, the scheduled appointment was cancelled.",

Capacity to evaluate, test, admit or isolate persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 depend on healthcare resources available and case-loads which will vary from country-to-country and the degree of transmission in each. A \"SASH\" strategy followed up with a tele-health consult via phone call may be an effective intervention to optimize limited hospital resources. Nonetheless, given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19 outbreak response and differing national resources, the SASH algorithm would need to be contextualized and may need to be modified to meet changing needs.
