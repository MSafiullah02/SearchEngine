A biology sequences visualization scheme based on cellular automata is developed in this study. Features such as alleles of a DNA sequence were extracted and mapped into a grid in a twodimensional plane, creating an initial pattern. Then, two-dimensional cellular automata were iteratively executed according to predefined rules and turned the initial pattern into a two-dimensional pattern, forming the fingerprint of the sequence. This fingerprint can be served as a representation of the sequence and can be used to make sequences comparing.",

If the cells with the state 0 were marked as white and the cells with the state 1 were marked as black, a group of STRs would form a mosaic pattern in the plane, and an initial image was created.

Appropriate visualization methods can help understand the various features of a sequence by revealing the characteristics and rules hidden in the sequence. DNA sequences can be highly similar to each other except in the polymorphism sites, which may indicate significant functional differences. Most existing visualization methods display an entire sequence, but the approach in this study is able to extract features from the sequence, and use these features as a characteristic fingerprint of the original sequence. Our scheme involves a step to map the biological characteristics into a two-dimensional plane using iterative process according to cellular automata rules. Different sequences would produce distinctive mapping results, which can act as a sequence icon, a much more informative way to represent a sequence. The salient patterns on the images can be used to compare sequences and make important features such as differences in genotypes stand out. It is also necessary to hide the original genetic information when the right to privacy is involved. Our approach can be considered as an encryption method and visualization of biological inheritance information. Each feature in the original DNA sequence is mapped to a different plane's location, and then participates in an iterative process of cellular automata. Although the final image is derived from the original genetic information, the original sequence cannot be readily reconstructed from the final image. Visualization can assist understanding large scale and complex data such as biological sequences. We have developed an approach to visualize important biological sequence features, by generating images from the original sequences based on cellular automata. We have demonstrated that through an iterative process, important sequence features such as short tandem repeats or single nucleotide polymorphism in a pair of biological sequences can be converted to a pair of images with visually easy to identify patterns, offering a new way for sequence visualization and comparison. When different rules were used in the process, or different times of iteration were run, the result could be distinctively different. In fact, other features such as bases distribution, motif interval can also be visualized by our method.",

The state of each cell takes discrete values from a finite set. The state of a cell at time t is a function of the states of a finite number of neighborhood cells at time 1 t \u2212 . Cellular automaton includes five parts: cell space, states, neighborhood structure, update function, and boundary condition. A cellular automata system A can be represented by: is the cell arrangement lattice of some cellular automata, where d is the dimension of the cellular automata. S is the discrete state of each cell. N is the collection of all cells in a neighborhood of a center cell. If a neighborhood has n cells, they form a vector function, is a rule that defines the state for each cell at time t as a function of the state of the neighborhood cells at time 1 t \u2212 . Usually, it is denoted by a table containing neighborhood cell's states and cell's new state. B is the boundary condition describing the boundary cell's state conversion criteria.

The total states combination number of all the five cells is 2 5 =32, since each cell has only two states of 0 and 1. The state of the middle cell in time t is determined by the states of all the 5 neighborhood cells in time 1 t \u2212 . A truth table of 32 rows with five input cell states and one output cell states can describe the state transformations. When the output value permuted according to the value of input, a 32bit binary string can be formed. For example, if the string is 01101101101101101111101011001000, it means when the states of up, down, left, right cells and middle cells is 00000 in time 1 t \u2212 , the state of the middle cell is the first bit in the 32-bit string, which is",
