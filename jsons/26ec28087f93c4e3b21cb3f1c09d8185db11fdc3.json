Tan Tock Seng Hospital was the epicenter in the coordination and management of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. Now, together with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital is taking the lead in Singapore's efforts to navigate this pandemic. In dealing with COVID-19, given the scale of the pandemic, surgeons and surgical teams all around the world face unique challenges to daily operations, having to fulfill alternate nonsurgical roles while reducing attrition. We hope to share our experience from the perspective of the Division of Surgery, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, on our actions in responding to this challenge, in the hope that it may benefit others during this global crisis.",

            "text": "On January 23, 2020, Singapore became one of the first countries outside China to report a case of COVID-19. 1 In early February, the World Health Organization reported that Singapore had the most cases of COVID-19 outside China. 2 This, however, was not the first time Singapore faced such a grave pandemic. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic spread to 28 countries, and Singapore was severely affected. Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) was at the epicenter of the fight against SARS in Singapore. Being one of the largest acute care hospitals in Singapore, providing multispeciality care with high volumes of emergency department (ED) visits and trauma cases, daily operations at TTSH were severely disrupted during SARS. Born out of the need to bolster Singapore's response to pandemics, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) was built and recently inaugurated in 2019. NCID is a 330-bed, purpose-built facility designed to augment Singapore's capabilities in infectious disease management and prevention. It houses a screening center (SC), isolation and cohort wards, ICU wards, independent laboratories, radiology imaging facilities, endoscopy capabilities, and operating theaters (OTs). NCID is closely annexed to TTSH, and relies upon TTSH as a multispeciality general hospital for a full range of clinical and logistic services. In peacetime, many of the NCID resources are in standby mode. In the COVID-19 pandemic, since February 2020, NCID has been resourced for outbreak response by reducing TTSH business-as-usual work proportionately. To enhance NCID capabilities to respond to COVID-19, TTSH staff were deployed to NCID in various capacities. Division of Medicine staff were primarily engaged to cover the expanding number of isolation wards; the Division of Surgery staff were primarily engaged in providing screening services in clinical suspects at the NCID SC. As countries around the world, especially in Europe, struggle to control the pandemic, we would like to share the experience of the surgical division of TTSH in the hope that it might benefit other healthcare institutions during this challenging period.",

All staff who were unwell were encouraged to report to the hospital's occupational health clinic or NCID SC, depending on their exposure risk. All staff working in TTSH had N95 mask fitting done at the time of their recruitment; however, to close any gaps, additional mask fitting sessions were organized with collaboration from the Infection Control department on very short notice. Each staff was fitted with at least 2 different models of N95 so that the staff could continue to work safely even if 1 model became unavailable due to supply issues. For relevant staff, just-intime training was conducted on the use of the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) and donning of personal protective equipment, with videos made available via several hospital e-learning platforms. All staff pantries' seating arrangements were redesigned, including in OT, to allow for adequate social distancing and with staggered mealtimes to reduce crowding.",

The pandemic has brought back tragic memories of SARS, which affected 238 patients, causing 33 deaths, including TTSH healthcare workers. 4 There has been more widespread proliferation of mobile usage and social media usage now compared with the SARS period. While facilitating ease of information dissemination, inaccurate and false reporting has also been repeated and perpetuated through these digital media, causing further panic and anxiety. To counter this, timely, accurate, coordinated, honest, and responsible reporting from hospital leadership is necessary to allay the concerns among healthcare workers in a time of uncertainty. Messages of support and gratitude from hospital leadership and community are important to bolster the resolve and morale of the healthcare workers. Leave policies initially called for cancellation of all leave for all staff; however, given the likely protracted nature of the pandemic, to sustain morale over the longer-term, this was relaxed to allow for local leave, with the caveat that staff must be contactable at all times to return to the hospital if necessary.",

Regular engagement with the staff by leadership, either in person or via teleconferencing, was also important for communicating information and updates on strategic direction. Nonessential overseas leave was also suspended to reduce the risk of overseas importation of COVID-19; this included pre-planned holidays, workshops, and conferences. Staff who had to travel overseas required approval from senior hospital leadership and were placed on a 14-day leave of absence on return to mitigate any risk of importation of COVID-19.",
