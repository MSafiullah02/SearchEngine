The data so far suggest, however, that about half of all infections occur before the dreaded symptoms of fever or a persistent cough appear. It is therefore not enough to quarantine people only after they show symptoms. To reduce infections, one would need to act quickly when a person is diagnosed with COVID-19 to find all people this person was in close proximity with. The risk of infection is highest if one has been within 1.5-2 m of an infected person for at least 10-15 minutes. If it could be determined who had been in such close proximity, then one could ask freshly infected, presymptomatic people to self-isolate and thus stop them from infecting more people. Mathematical models of the pandemic [6] show that fast contact tracing combined with a large-scale virus-testing program might be able to not just delay the epidemic but to stop it entirely. This would also mean that the lockdown measures currently in place around the world could be slowly loosened up again. However, such fast contact tracing is not possible manually. Only a digital, largely automatic solution would help.",

After all, this is about saving the lives and preserving the health of as many people as possible. Weakening data protection might be preferable to the far-reaching restrictions of personal freedom and to the economic costs of the current lockdown. In keeping with this, many countries have started tracking their citizens\u2019 phones and using location data to monitor the spread of the virus as well as to enforce both lockdown and early isolation restrictions. The most prominent example of this is China [7], where entry to many public places is restricted to people who can show a green health code on their smartphones and thus demonstrate they have not been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. However, countries like Israel [8] or South Korea [9] use location data as well\u2014in the former case, to enforce quarantine rules and notify the contacts of an infected person, and in the latter to warn people before they enter \u201chigh risk\u201d zones. However, even in the face of an existential threat, we should interfere with fundamental rights as little as possible. Among the effective approaches, we should choose the one that least compromises fundamental rights. In particular, we believe that swift and efficient contact tracing is possible without collecting extensive amounts of data in a central database.",

Be it on the bus or at work\u2014what matters is proximity to a contagious person. This means that particularly sensitive location data, such as GPS or radio cell data, is actually neither necessary nor useful. Instead, the only data that matters is whether two people have come into close enough contact to risk an infection. One example of this would be contact tracing based on \u201ccontact points\u201d as suggested by Yasaka et al [10]. The smartphone app they propose would allow users to create \u201ccheckpoints\u201d by generating a QR code that can be scanned by all other app users when joining their checkpoint. If checkpoints were created for any social interaction, be it among friends and family or in public spaces like a restaurant, then the app could use both this information and voluntary notifications from users should they be diagnosed with the virus to compute transmission graphs. These graphs in turn could let every user know if there were any possible transmission paths leading up to the checkpoints they visited and thus their risk of being infected. The app would not need any location data and in fact wouldn\u2019t even require users to register. It would, however, require the active participation of users who would need to either create or join a checkpoint whenever they get close to someone outside their household. Thus, this approach relies on high levels of vigilance and willingness to participate among at least a majority of the population\u2014not only initially but also as the pandemic continues.",

The general drawback of Bluetooth\u2014that it can only reach across a few meters\u2014becomes an advantage here. The tracking itself would work as follows: as many people as possible voluntarily install the app on their phone. The app cryptographically generates a new temporary ID every half hour. As soon as another phone with the same app is in close proximity, both phones receive the temporary ID of the respective other app and record it.

The server is not able to decrypt this information in a way that allows for the identification of individuals. However, it is able to notify all affected phones. This is because the server does not need any personal data to send a message to someone\u2019s phone. The server only needs a so-called PushToken, a kind of digital address of an app installation on a particular phone. This PushToken is generated when the app is installed on the user\u2019s phone. At the same time, the app will send a copy of the PushToken, as well as the temporary IDs it sends out over time, to a central server. The server could be hosted, for example, by the Robert Koch Institute for Germany or by the National Health Service for the United Kingdom.

There is reason to believe that the level of support can be increased by opting for a data-minimizing solution. A representative survey [11] across the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and France shows that about 70% of respondents would install an app like the one described above on their phones (disclosure: co-author JA was also the lead author of the survey study). The reason most frequently brought up against an installation is the worry that the government could use the app as an excuse for greater surveillance after the end of the epidemic. If the government wants as many people as possible to install the app, it should take these concerns seriously and refrain from using location data. Contact tracing works without it.",
