The annual return of the disease is driven by the antigenic variability of the influenza virus; two or three amino acid changes in the haemagglutinin (HA) protein on the virus surface can greatly reduce the effectiveness of existing antibodies, leaving people vulnerable to repeated influenza infections throughout their lives. In addition to this gradual change in the influenza virus, which is known as ANTIGENIC DRIFT, influenza A viruses can acquire novel surface proteins against which existing antibodies are ineffective2. When this kind of ANTIGENIC SHIFT occurs, up to one-third of the population can become ill in an explosive global pandemic3,4.",

Second, influenza A viruses can infect many animal hosts, including wild waterfowl, poultry, pigs and horses. Under circumstances that have not yet been fully characterized, influenza strains can cross between species. The ability to reassort and the existence of several reservoirs of influenza virus provide many possibilities for the generation of novel influenza virus strains2.",

The genetic composition of the viruses responsible for the 1957 and 1968 pandemics is known; these viruses seem to have been generated by reassortment between an avian influenza strain and the strain then circulating in humans. In the 1957 H2N2-SUBTYPE pandemic virus, both influenza surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase (NA), and one internal protein, polymerase B1 (PB1), were closely related to Eurasian wild waterfowl influenza proteins6,7. In 1968, the H3N2 pandemic virus contained novel HA and PB1 proteins, also apparently of Eurasian wild waterfowl origin7,8. Although it is not known exactly how these reassortant viruses were generated, pigs can be infected with both avian and human influenza strains and this species has been suggested as a potential 'mixing vessel' for the generation of pandemic viruses2,9.",

In addition to a death toll that is several times higher than that of other influenza pandemics, the 1918 H1N1 virus took its greatest toll on young adults instead of the very old and very young who are usually most affected by influenza12,13,14,15,16. Recently, isolation of the genetic material of the 1918 strain from formalin-fixed and frozen case material has made it possible to determine the genetic sequence of this virus. Five of the eight genome segments have been sequenced17,18,19,20,21,22. Analyses of these sequences are underway to try to understand whether the 1918 pandemic strain was generated by the same pattern of reassortment as the 1957 and 1968 strains. It is possible that the unusual characteristics of the 1918 pandemic were, in part, due to an unusual origin. Even if this is not the case, it is important to know whether there is another pathway for the generation of pandemic strains so that surveillance for emerging strains can be optimized.",

The 1918 NP sequence is placed within the mammalian clade whether total, SYNONYMOUS or NON-SYNONYMOUS substitutions are analysed. However, a BLAST search of the 1918 NP protein reveals that the amino acid sequences to which it is most closely related are avian. It differs from the A/Duck/Bavaria/2/77 (H1N1) strain by only eight amino acids, compared with 11 amino acid differences from the A/Swine/Iowa/15/30 (H1N1) strain and 16 from the A/Wilson-Smith/33 (H1N1) strain (an early human virus). Conversely, the 1918 NP gene differs from the A/Duck/ Bavaria/2/77 NP sequence by 193 nucleotides (87.1% identity), from the A/Swine/Iowa/15/30 sequence by 67 nucleotides (95.5% identity) and from A/Wilson-Smith/33 by 65 nucleotides (95.6% identity).

Avian sequences vary from each other at many synonymous sites, but they are all similarly distant from the avian consensus sequence. Therefore, if the 1918 virus acquired its NP from an avian virus that is similar to current avian strains, it should have a similar number of synonymous changes compared with the avian consensus sequence. One would also expect the 1918 strain to be more similar either to the Eurasian or the North American consensus sequences, as is true of the avian strains that have been sequenced so far. Table 1 and Fig. 1 show that this is not the case. The NP sequence of the 1918 virus differs by 173 nucleotides from the overall avian consensus sequence, by 187 nucleotides from the North American avian consensus sequence and by 179 nucleotides from the Eurasian avian consensus sequence. So, it is only slightly more closely related to the consensus sequences than it is to individual strains, and no more closely related to one avian clade than the other. By contrast, individual avian sequences are more closely related to the avian consensus sequences than they are to each other, and much more closely related to the consensus of their own clade than to the consensus of the other clade (Table 1).",

So, although the HA gene of the 1957 pandemic strain is not a perfect match for any of the avian sequences in the database, with only 60 nucleotide differences from the avian consensus it is clear that it could have come directly from a Eurasian wild waterfowl. Similarly, within the H3 subtype, North American avian strains differ from Eurasian avian strains by >130 nucleotides and 16 amino acids, and one Eurasian strain can differ from another by as many as 60 nucleotides and seven amino acids. Again, the H3 gene of the 1968 pandemic virus is sufficiently similar to the known wild waterfowl sequences to have reassorted directly from this source. By contrast, in the H1 avian clade, strains from North American birds differ from Eurasian bird strains by an average of 92 nucleotides and 13 amino acids, and the differences are even smaller within the two avian subclades. The HA sequence from the 1918 pandemic H1 strain has more than twice as many differences from the avian consensus than any avian sequence.

The earliest swine H1 isolate from the outbreak of avian H1N1 influenza in European pigs27,28, the A/Swine/Arnsberg/ 6554/79 (H1N1) isolate, has 40 nucleotide and 19 amino acid differences from the Eurasian avian HA1 consensus sequence \u2014 which is comparable to the number of differences between the H2 and H3 pandemic HAs and their avian consensus sequences. Twenty years later, the swine H1 lineage had accumulated 67 nucleotide and 36 amino acid differences (using A/Swine/Belgium/1/98 (H1N1) as an example). So, after 20 years in swine, the avian-derived H1 has acquired as many amino acid differences from the avian consensus as the 1918 strain, but it has fewer than half as many synonymous changes (67 compared with 174 in the 1918 strain). Again, preliminary results indicate that adaptation in an intermediate host such as the pig is unlikely to explain the large number of synonymous differences and the high S/N ratio between the 1918 sequence and avian sequences that have been characterized so far.",

Within the Eurasian avian clade, sequences differ by as many as 25 nucleotides and six amino acids (comparing A/Chicken/Victoria/1/85 (H7N7) and A/Chicken/Hong Kong/220/97 (H5N1), for example). Within the North American avian clade, sequences differ by as many as 16 nucleotides and two amino acids (comparing A/Pintail/Alberta/119/79 (H4N6) and A/Gull/Delaware/475/86 (H2N2)). Given this diversity, as the 1918 NS1 sequence differs from the most closely related avian sequence, A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 (H2N2), by 24 nucleotides and four amino acids it seems possible that the 1918 NS segment was acquired directly from an avian strain. Eighty years later, the human NS1 lineage (using A/Shiga/25/97 (H3N2) as an example) had accumulated another 39 nucleotide and 33 amino acid differences from the 1918 strain, consistent with the hypothesis that the 1918 NS had not circulated in humans for a long time before the pandemic.",

Since 1918, modern human NS2 sequences (again using A/Shiga/25/97 (H3N2) as an example) have accumulated another 26 nucleotide and six amino acid changes. So, the 1918 NS2 gene sequence is also consistent with a recent origin for the NS segment at the time of the pandemic.",

Several of the gene segments \u2014 HA, NA and NP \u2014 have so many synonymous changes from known sequences of wild-bird strains that it seems unlikely that they could have reassorted directly from an avian strain similar to those that have been sequenced so far. This is especially apparent when one examines differences at four-fold degenerate sites, which should be subject to little selective pressure. At the same time, the 1918 sequences have too few amino acid differences from wild-bird strains to have spent many years adapting in a human or swine intermediate host. One possible explanation is that these gene segments were acquired from a reservoir of influenza virus that has not yet been sampled. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that strains from this unidentified host could form a subclade within the avian clade, similar to the subclades that are formed by the Eurasian and North American waterfowl sequences.",

The M1 gene, in its pattern of synonymous and non-synonymous differences from avian sequences, resembles the genome segments listed above, consistent with an origin in a novel host. At the same time, the four amino acid changes in the extracellular domain of the M2 protein might indicate that this genome segment was retained from the previously circulating human strain. As the two genes are encoded by a single genome segment, and therefore must have a common origin, more information will be required to determine the origin of the 1918 MA segment.",

Proof of the hypothesis that the virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic had an origin markedly different from the viruses responsible for the 1957 and 1968 pandemics would require both the discovery of a sample of the human influenza strain that was circulating before 1918 and the discovery of influenza strains in the wild that more closely resemble the 1918 sequences. At present, it is only possible to assert that the sequences of the 1918 pandemic virus do not seem to be consistent with an origin similar to that of the 1957 and 1968 pandemic viruses. Enhanced sampling and surveillance of wild-animal populations to find additional influenza reservoirs could be a prudent course of action30,31,32, given the consequences of missing the emergence of a pandemic strain like that of 1918.",
