All these advancements were aimed to increase average human life span and to decrease the child mortality rate. A signifi cant step taken in this regard was the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) launched by WHO in 1980s in which children all over the world are vaccinated against six deadly diseases (BCG, OPV, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles) with the aim of immunizing 80 % of all children by 1990. However, even after all these efforts 20 % of infants are still left unimmunized; responsible for approximately two million unnecessary deaths every year, especially in remote and impoverished parts of the globe ( Langridge 2006 ) . Moreover, immunization remains an unfi nished agenda with an estimated 19.3 million children were not reached with three doses of DTP vaccine in 2010. Those who are not immunized -about every Fifth Child -are mostly among the poorest and the most vulnerable.",

            "text": "Vaccination is an important tool for prevention of many diseases. It is the administration of vaccine to produce immunity to a disease. Vaccination involves the stimulation of the immune system to prepare it for the event of an invasion from a particular pathogen for which the immune system has been primed (Arntzen 1997 ) . On recognizing the foreign substance (live/ weakened microbes, antigen or proteins) which enters the body through vaccine, the immune system activates, producing antibodies to destroy the invader. Not only this but this attack leaves behind the 'memory' T and B cells which guards body in case of any future attack by that pathogen. Some vaccines provide lifelong protection; others (such as those for cholera and tetanus) must be re-administered periodically (Langridge 2006 ) . Classically, this has been achieved by presenting the immune system with whole viruses or bacteria that have been killed or made too weak to proliferate much. However, these conventional vaccines poses threat of actually acquiring the infection from weakened or attenuated pathogenic strains. Thus newer approach uses sub unit vaccines and recombinant vaccines. These vaccines consist of specifi c macromolecules that induce a protective immune response against a pathogen rather than administering the whole pathogen in the body. A \"subunit vaccine\" refers to a pathogen-derived protein (or even just an immunogenic domain of a protein, i.e. \"an epitope\") that cannot cause disease but can elicit a protective immune response against the pathogen. Very often the subunit-vaccine candidate is a recombinant protein made in transgenic production-hosts (such as cultured yeast cells), then purifi ed, and injected as vaccines to immunize against a specifi c disease (Mor and Arntzen 2002 ) . These sub-unit vaccines increases vaccine safety by circumventing the need to use live viruses or microbes and has thus made them the preferred approach for vaccine manufacturers (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 1998 ).",

Although these vaccines have an undue advantage over traditional conventional vaccines but they are expensive and their storage and transportation pose a problem as many of them require refrigeration. This is a disadvantage in many of the developing countries where the vaccines were needed most. Thus, to ensure a successful global immunization a whole new idea of plant edible vaccines was presented by Arntzen and co-workers in 1992 , by introducing the concept of transgenic plants as a production and delivery system for subunit vaccines (Mason et al. 1992 ; Mason and Arntzen 1995 ) .

This idea was quite promising in terms of providing a successful tool for mass immunization in developing countries where till now vaccination is hampered by high cost of production and delivery of vaccines. Basic concept of edible vaccines involves the production of plants containing antigens required to stimulate the immune response in human body. Thus by simply eating the plant product people will get vaccination against diseases. However the concept sounds quite simple but its development was equally complex. To produce edible vaccine, plants are engineered to contain desired gene of interest which codes for the antigen. This process is accomplished by transformation and the altered plant containing foreign gene is called transgenic plant. Thus, the process remains the same as with subunit vaccine preparation because it contains only desired antigen and not the whole pathogen. These vaccines basically work in the same way as the injected DNA vaccine, since a peptide sequence similar to an infectious part of a pathogen is synthesized, by itself, and is used to prime T and B cells in the body. The big difference in this case is that the protein sequences are encoded in a plant to form the desired protein. This protein is then ingested, as the plant or its fruit is eaten. One becomes immune against the ingested protein, as T and B cells become stimulated to proliferate and differentiate (Mor et al. 1998 ). Expression of vaccines in plant tissues eliminates the risk of contamination with animal pathogens, provides a heat-stable environment, and enables oral delivery, thus eliminating injection-related hazards (Walmsley and Arntzen 2000 ) .",

            "text": "Edible vaccines are mucosal-targeted vaccines that stimulate both the systematic and mucosal immune network, activating the fi rst line of defense of human body through mucosa. The mucosal surfaces are found lining the digestive tract, respiratory tract and urinoreproductive tract. Mucosal immune system (MIS) is the fi rst line of defense and the most effective site of vaccination, nasal and oral vaccines being the most effective (Mor et al. 1998 ; Korban et al. 2002 ) . Before understanding the mechanism of action of edible vaccines it is important to understand the functioning of MIS. Induction of a mucosal immune response starts with the recognition of an antigen by specialized cells called M-cells. These cells are localized in the mucosal membranes of lymphoid tissues such as Peyer's patches within the small intestines. The M-cells channel the antigen to underlying tissues where antigenpresenting cells internalize and process the antigen. The resulting antigenic epitopes are presented on the APC surface, and with the assistance of helper T cells activate B cells. The activated B cells migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes where they mature into plasma cells and migrate to mucosal membranes to secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) A. On passing through the mucosal epithelial layer towards the lumen, the IgA molecules complex with membrane-bound secretary components to form secretary IgA (sIgA). Transported into the lumen, the sIgA interacts with specifi c antigenic epitopes and neutralize the invading pathogen (Walmsley and Arntzen 2000 ) . When edible vaccines are eaten they degrade majority of the plant cells in the intestine as a result of the action of digestive and bacterial enzymes. This degradation results in the release of antigens present in the plant product. The whole process occurs near the Peyer's patches (Rudzik et al. 1975 ) where M cells recognize the released antigen and lead to the production of IgA antibodies in mucosal lymphoid tissues through the above mentioned mechanism. These IgA antibodies get transported across the epithelial cells into the lumen where they interact with released antigens depicting immunogenic response.",

In this case gene gun eliminates the requirement of vector by directly bombarding the target gene in plant tissue, through the technique known as bolistic method. Second strategy involves the use of plant viruses as vectors which results in transient expression of the foreign gene. The effect of the added genes is to make the plant or plant virus produce antigens which are normally found only on the surfaces of the pathogen.

Electroporation First method involves the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a carrier or vector system for introduction of antigen producing gene in plant genome. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil bacterium responsible for producing crown gall tumor in plants via its Ti (tumor inducing) plasmid. A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes has the property to integrate their plasmid DNA with nuclear genome of host (plants) cells. This property is exploited for introducing foreign gene in plants and the process is called 'transformation' while the plants produced through this process are 'transgenic plants'. During transformation the bacterial plasmid is fi rst disarmed by removing tumor inducing gene and the target gene for a selected immunogen is introduced. Along with the target gene, antibiotic resistance genes were also added in the plasmid which acts as marker genes to identify the transformed plant tissues containing bacterial plasmid. The bacterium is then co cultivated with the wounded plant tissues so that the bacterial DNA penetrate the plant cells. Following this the target gene randomly incorporates in the plant nuclear genome. After selection through antibiotic resistance successfully transformed plant tissues are identifi ed and regenerated into whole plants under in vitro conditions. These transformed plant lines show varying degree of expression for introduced gene thus producing varying amount of desired antigen (Shah et al. 2011 ) . Plant line showing highest expression is identifi ed and propagated on large scale to be used as edible vaccine. The drawback of this method is that it gives low yield and the process is slow. It requires about 6 weeks to18 months for whole plants to be formed through this process depending on regeneration ability of various plant species under in vitro conditions. This method is more successful in dicotyledonous plants like potato, tomato and tobacco which are easy to transform through Agrobacterium in comparison to monocotyledons.",

In this method selected DNA sequences are precipitated onto metal microparticles and bombarded against the plant tissue with a particle gun at an accelerated speed. Microparticles penetrate the walls and release the exogenous DNA inside the cell where it will be integrated in the nuclear genome through mechanisms that have yet to be clearly understood (Mishra et al. 2008 ). This method is quite attractive because DNA can be delivered into cells of plant which makes gene transfer independent of regeneration ability of the species. But the chief limitation is the need for costly device particle gun (Shah et al. 2011 ) .",

            "text": "Another approach of plant edible vaccine production utilizes plant viral expression systems which addresses the low yield issue of transformation approach. The rationale of this approach is based on the notion that during viral replication, gene copy number becomes amplifi ed, resulting in a much higher level of transgene expression than observed with stable transformation. Among the potential advantages of transient viral expression of transgenes over stably transformed transgenic plants are the shorter time for cloning of foreign genes in the viral genome as compared with the time required to transform plants, the ease at which antigen production can be scaled up, and the wide host range of plant viruses that allows the use of multiple plant species as biofactories (Koprowski and Yushibov 2001 ) . Capsid proteins of many types of viruses can assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). Devoid of the viral genetic material, VLPs often resemble the native virions in their morphology, antigenic properties and stability. These VLPs are genetically engineered to express the desired peptides/proteins. Two techniques namely 'Overcoat technology' and 'Epicoat technology' are used to design VLPs that contain antigen DNA on their surface. Some plant viruses like CPMV (cowpea mosaic virus), alfalfa mosaic virus, TMV (tobacco mosaic virus), CaMV (caulifl ower mosaic virus), Potato virus X and tomato bushy stunt virus can be used effectively for this purpose. Overcoat technology permits the plant to produce the entire protein, whereas epicoat technology involves the expression of only foreign protein (Lal et al. 2007 ). The recombinant virus is then inoculated into the host plant which produces several antigenic proteins (Mor et al. 1998 ). These particulate antigens generally elicit stronger mucosal immune responses than soluble antigens, which can often repress the immune response by inducing immunotolerance (Garside and Mowat 1997 ) . However, each single antigen expressed in plants must be tested for its proper assembly and can be verifi ed by animal studies, Western blot; and quantifi ed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Haq et al. 1995 ) . This method offers rapid onset of expression, and the systemic spread of virus so that protein is produced in every cell (Desai et al. 2010 ) . VLPs are therefore predicted to make excellent mucosal vaccines (Estes et al. 1997 ) .",

Also the subsequent plant generations do not inherit the foreign gene as it is not incorporated into the plant genome.

Before administration, chimeric virus particles are often purifi ed from host-plant tissues that are unpalatable, containing toxins or are not practical for direct consumption. Nevertheless, the high level of foreign protein expression (up to 2 g/kg of plant tissue) within a short period (1-2 weeks after inoculation) makes this an attractive alternative for vaccine production (Walmsley and Arntzen 2000 ) .",

(e) As edible vaccine can be administered orally, they elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity which is not observed in traditional vaccines.

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of chronic viremia in humans (Purcell 1994 ) . The hepatitis B virus is estimated to have infected 400 million people throughout the globe, making it one of the most common human pathogens. Since immunization is the only known method to prevent the disease of Hepatitis B, any attempt to reduce its infection requires the availability of large quantities of vaccine, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (Malik et al. 2011 ) . Mason et al. 1992 demonstrated the expression of HBsAg at levels equal to 0.01 % of total soluble protein in tobacco. However, The low level of expression of the HBsAg in transgenic tobacco (0.01 % of soluble protein) and the alkaloids present in the crude plant extract prevent direct feeding studies. Thus, Mason et al conducted further studies with tobacco-derived recombinant HBsAg (rHBsAg) protein that was recovered from leaf extracts as a VLP with an average size of 22 nm, which are similar to those found in the sera of infected humans and in the commercial vaccine (Cabral et al. 1978 ) . These plant-derived VLPs mimic the appearance of recombinant yeastderived HBsAg particles (Scolnick et al. 1984 ) , which is the material that is used in commercially available recombinant vaccine for hepatitis B (Recombivaxm; distributed by Merck, Sharpe, and Dohme) and can be injected as vaccinogen directly. In addition, the plant-derived material had similar buoyant density and antigenicity to human and yeast-derived HBsAg, indicating faithful preservation of protein folding characteristics in the plant system'. Thus a crude extract of rHBsAg from plants was used in parenteral immunization studies with mice (Thanavala et al. 1995 ) . The extract caused an immune response that was similar to the one achieved with Recombivaxm, So the studies concluded that the rHBsAg from plants demonstrate that B-and T-cell epitopes of HBsAg are preserved when the antigen is expressed in transgenic plants, and that the recombinant antigen is produced as a VLP that mimics the currently available commercial vaccine. Subsequently many papers were published characterizing the recombinant product which assembled into virus like particles (VLPs), and could invoke specifi c immune responses in mice upon parenteral delivery. Further studies were made by Arntzen group to prove that plant-derived HBsAg can stimulate mucosal immune responses via the oral route, for which they employed potato tubers as an expression system and optimized it to increase accumulation of the protein in the plant tubers (Richter et al. 2000 ) . The resulting plant material proved superior to the yeast-derived antigen in both priming and boosting of immune responses to oral immunogen in mice (Kong et al. 2001 ; Richter et al. 2000 ) . The HBsAg has also been expressed in banana (May et al. 1995 ) and lettuce (Kapusta et al. 1999 ) . Recently Kumar et al. ( 2005 ) transformed embryogenic cells of banana with the 's' gene of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using Agrobacterium mediated transformation. The expression levels of the antigen in the plants grown under in vitro conditions as well as the green house hardened plants were estimated by ELISA. Maximum expression level of 38 ng/g F.W. of leaves was noted in plants transformed with pEFEHBS grown under in vitro conditions, whereas pHER transformed plants grown in the green house showed the maximum expression level of 19.92 ng/g F.W. of leaves. HBsAg obtained by them from transgenic banana plants was found to be similar to human serum derived one in buoyant density properties. Kumar et al. ( 2005 ) advocated that although expression levels of the antigen are low in banana fruits, the expression levels of the vaccine antigens can be increased by the use of promoter of abundant pulp protein (Clendennen et al. 1998 ) , or promoters of the proteins found in abundance in the ripe banana fruits (Peumans et al. 2002 ) . McGarvey et al. ( 1995 ) have reported the expression of rabies virus (RV) glycoprotein in transgenic tomatoes. Although McGarvey et al. did not reported on the immunogenicity of the tomato RV glycoprotein, Yusibov et al. ( 1997 ) have reported the induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice that were parenterally vaccinated with a peptide of RV glycoprotein fused to a plant virus coat protein. antigen-capsid fusion is one of the alternative strategies of producing a plant-based vaccine where plants are infected with recombinant viruses carrying the desired antigen in viral coat protein. The infected plants have been reported to produce the desired fusion protein in large amounts in a short time. It should, however, be kept in view that recombinant viruses need to be highly purifi ed for parenteral administration or partially purifi ed for oral administration. Modelska et al. ( 1998 ) reported that immunization of mice intraperitoneally or orally by gastric incubation or by feeding of plants infected with the recombinant alfalfa mosaic virus (AIMV) carrying rabies peptide CPDrg showed local as well as systemic immune response. After immunization, 40 % of the mice were protected against the challenge with a lethal dose of the virus. This report also demonstrated stronger immune responses in mice that consumed the chimeric viruses in planta rather than after purifi cation (Modelska et al. 1998 ). Recently, Loza-Rubio and coworkers developed transgenic maize expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein of the Vnukovo strain and they evaluated its immunogenicity in mice by the oral route. Animals were fed once with 50 \u03bcg of protein and challenged 90-days later with a rabies virus isolated from vampire bats. The edible vaccine induced viral neutralizing antibodies which protected mice 100 % against challenge (Loza-Rubio et al. 2008 ).",

Cholera is a devastating diarrheal disease that has caused recurrent pandemics throughout the world since 1871 (Yu and Langridge 2000 ) . The heatlabile enterotoxin (LT) of ETEC is closely related to cholera toxin (CT). Haq et al. ( 1995 ) proved that a bacterial antigen (LT-B) could be expressed in edible tissues of transgenic plants and could assemble into pentameric ring structures (as shown by its ability to bind gangliosides). In addition, and most importantly, LT-B expressed in plants was shown to induce the production of both serum and mucosal antibodies in mice fed with transgenic potato tubers. However, the low level of expression of LT-B in potato tubers, implied that people would have to eat an unreasonably large amount of tuber to receive the desired dose. Mason et al. ( 1998 ) improved expression levels of LT-B in transgenic plants by the construction of a 'plant-friendly' synthetic LT-B gene. The protein product of this synthetic gene accumulates to ~0.15 % of the soluble protein, which is .10-fold higher than the best levels obtained previously by Haq et al. ( 1995 ) . These higher expression levels have allowed this 'edible vaccine' to be tested in humans, representing the fi rst human clinical trial of a plant-derived vaccine where 100 g of raw potato tubers expressing LT-B of ETEC in three doses had to be consumed in order to overcome digestive losses of the antigen and to elicit a signifi cant immune response (Tacket et al. 1998 ) . These results showed, for the fi rst time, that food plant-based vaccines are immunogenic in humans.",

Norwalk virus capsid protein (NVCP) from the diarrhea causing Norwalk virus, expressed in transgenic tobacco and potato with 0.23 % of total soluble protein, also assembled VLPs and stimulated serum IgG and gut IgA specifi c for NVCP when fed to mice (Mason et al. 1996 ) . The clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development with NVCP potatoes ( Tacket et al. 2000 ) . Twenty adults ingested either two or three doses each of 150 g raw potato containing 215-750 lg NVCP. Nineteen of twenty adults showed signifi cant increases in the numbers of specifi c anti-NVCP antibody-secreting cells of the IgA subtype, and six developed increases in IgG antibody secreting cells. This study proved that orally delivered plantexpressed VLPs could stimulate immune responses and further that GM1 binding activities not required for oral immunization. These results suggest a new strategy for the development of plant vaccines. Individual soluble protein antigens are relatively ineffective for oral immunization because of intestinal digestion and lack of antigen tropism for GALT (gut associated lymphoid tissues). In contrast, VLPs are stable in the acidic environment of the stomach and resistant to enzyme digestion in the small intestine. Most important, VLPs preserve conformational epitopes located on the surface of viral particles, which are recognized by the host immune system. Compared with other viral antigens, the plant-produced VLP may be the more effective antigen for protection against infectious enteric viral diseases (Yu and Langridge 2000 ) . Attempts are underway to engineer bananas and powdered tomatoes expressing norwalk virus.",

As a result of malarial-infection, an estimated three million lives are lost annually, among them are over one million children (majority under 5 years of age).The world malaria situation has become signifi cantly worse in recent years as the main forms of malaria control, spraying programmes and chemotherapy, becoming less effective in the development of vector and parasite resistance. In a study by Beachy et al. ( 1996 ) a 13-amino-acid epitope of zona pellucida , ZP3, protein and another epitope from malarial sporozoites have been expressed as fusion proteins with TMV capsid protein with the idea of developing anti-fertility and anti-malarial vaccines. The antigenicity of the products has been found to be positive. Currently, three malarial antigens are under investigation for the development of plant-based malaria vaccine, merozoite surface protein (MSP) 4,MSP 5 from Plasmodium falciparum, and MSP 4/5 from P. yoelli. Wang et al. ( 2004 ) has demonstrated that oral immunization of mice with recombinant MSP 4, MSP 4/5 and MSP1, co-administered with CTB as a mucosal adjuvant, induced antibody responses effective against blood-stage parasite. The study however involved complexity as the protein was expressed in E. coli and protection was only evident when high dose antigen was administered. Thus it is still uncertain if the oral delivery of a plant-derived malaria vaccine would induce signifi cant immune responses in humans. It has been suggested that antigen expression level in plants are so low that an unrealistic quantity of plant material would have to be consumed to achieve meaningful immunity. For this approach to become realistic improve antigenic expression has to be achieved. Moreover, due to high levels of antigen anticipated to be necessary, it is likely that strong adjutants will also be required (Wang et al. 2004 ). Hence, appropriate adjuvants have to be identifi ed and tested. Finally, in the face of reports showing induction of tolerance or immunity through comparable oral immunizations vaccination regimens must be rigorously tested in preclinical studies (Arakawa et al. 1998 ).",

Autoimmune diseases include arthritis, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. It was established by Arakawa et al. ( 1998 ) that food plants are feasible production and delivery systems for immunotolerization against autoimmune diseases. They found cholera toxin B to be useful as a carrier molecule for specifi c targeting to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). A cholera toxin B-insulin fusion protein produced in transgenic potato plants successfully protected non obese diabetic mice from development of autoimmune diabetes mellitus type I. Ma and Jevnikar ( 1999 ) expressed glutamic acid dehydrogenase in potatoes and fed them to non-obese diabetic mice, in which the reduced pancreatic islet infl ammation suggested immuno-tolerization of cytotoxic T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. An optimal oral dose of a plant-derived auto antigen can potentially inhibit development of the autoimmune disease (Carter and Langridge 2002 ; Sala et al. 2003 ) . Edible vaccine development for the prevention or treatment of cancer is diffi cult since tumor antigens are also auto-antigens (Zhang et al. 1998 ). Recently, a poly-epitope isolated from a human melanoma tumor was integrated into the nuclear and chloroplast DNA of tobacco in an attempt to develop a plant-derived melanoma vaccine (Sala et al. 2003 ) . McCormick et al. ( 1999 ) expressed a scFv antibody fragment of the immunoglobulin from a mouse B-cell lymphoma in tobacco with a viral vector and showed that mice injected with this vaccine were protected from challenge by a lethal dose of tumor. Another scFv fused to the potato virus X coat protein generated protection against lymphoma and myeloma (Savelyeva et al. 2001 ).",

Some of them were answered in the course of successive development in this fi eld while some still remain unanswered. Even after all the research and developments made in plant derived edible vaccines, there are some limitations and issues which are still to be addressed. A major impediment in the successful application of these vaccines is the low expression level of antigen and uncertain dosage. In all the studies mentioned above the expression level of antigen in plant tissue was not of practical utilization as to achieve the required immunity very large amount of plant product is need to be consumed. In addition, not all vaccine candidate proteins are highly immunogenic in plant tissues and secondary metabolites found in plants may compromise the ability of the vaccine candidate protein to induce immunity (Teli and Timko 2004 ) . Two solutions to overcome this limitation are being explored. First, techniques to enhance antigen accumulation in plant tissues are being explored. A number of factors, including genes encoding vaccine antigens can be optimized for plant codon use; plant promoters can be engineered to increase transcription levels; RNA splice sites and intron sequences can be removed codon usage, the type of 5\u2032-untranslated sequence incorporated, the presence of specifi c intra-and extracellular targeting or compartmentalization sequences present, the site of gene integration into the genome, etc. affect transgene expression and ultimately vaccine epitope accumulation in plants. Optimization of coding sequences of bacterial or viral genes for transient expression, as well as defining the best subcellular compartment for product accumulation to obtain optimal quantity and quality, is also being studied (Teli and Timko 2004 ) . To enhance the immunogenicity of the orally delivered antigens, the use of carrier proteins may also be required, especially for small, non-particulate subunit vaccine antigens (Walmsley and Arntzen 2000 ) . Another approach is to use bacterial enterotoxins such as CT or LT , mammalian and viral immunomodulator, or plant-derived secondary metabolites (Yu and Langridge 2001 ) . Although the constitutive expression of foreign genes may lead to the accumulation of foreign proteins to levels toxic in the plant, inducible promoters, which stimulate gene expression at specifi c points in plant development, may not only prevent accumu lation of toxic levels of the foreign gene product but may conserve the plant's photosynthate for generation of maximum plant growth, resulting in higher yields of recombinant proteins (Arakawa et al. 1997 (Arakawa et al. , 1998 . Thus, temporal and organ-and tissue-specifi c promoters activated in fruit, tubers, or seeds must be explored (Fiedler and Conrad 1995 ) .",

The addition of xylose and change from a b1!6 to a b1!3 linkage of fucose are typical in plants. A signifi cant difference with transprotein production in plants is their inability to add sialic acid to glycoproteins (Lerouge et al. 1998 ) . This sugar has been implicated in longer clearance times for proteins in the blood and therefore is a major factor for a select group of pharmaceutical proteins. However, plant glycan patterns may not represent a problem in terms of human health; they may affect conformational epitopes, or clearance of plant derived antibodies (Bakker et al. 2001 ; Ma et al. 2005 ) . This potential problem is likely to be overcome as we learn more about the requirements for these processes in both plant and animal cells (Bakker et al. 2001 ) .",

Also there will be a challenge in controlling transgene escape as the identifi cation of \"vaccine\" fruit vs a normal fruit would be diffi cult. Fruit vaccines should be easily identifi able to avoid the misadministration of the vaccine, which may lead to complications such as immunotolerance. Also the oral vaccines are complicated by the need to protect the antigen from the effects of the acidic and proteolytic environment of the gut. Hence, to be effective, oral subunit vaccines generally require higher doses than oral replicating vaccines (Walker 1994 ; Mestecky et al. 1997 ) Allergic reactions to plant protein glycans and other plant antigens is a challenging issue. It has been suggested that plant derived recombinant proteins or antibodies may have increased immunogenicity or allergenicity as compared to mammalian counterparts (Ma et al. 2005 ; Penney et al. 2011 ) . This is well explained by the fact that a state of tolerance or energy has been gained by the daily consumption of plant glycolproteins in our food (Ma et al. 2005 ) .",

Environmental concerns about mixing genetically modifi ed pollen with other crops or weeds have been continually raised (Stokstad and Vogel 2003 ) . This objection may be partially addressed by engineering the foreign gene into the chloroplast DNA (Ruf et al. 2001 ) . As chloroplast genome is maternally inherited it does not follow Mendelian pattern of inheritance (Zhang et al. 2003 ) so gene pollution caused by transgene escape through pollen can be controlled. Even if the pollen from plants that exhibit maternal inheritance contains metabolically active plastids, the plastid DNA is lost during pollen maturation and is not transmitted to the next generation . Therefore, the chloroplast expression system is an environmentally friendly approach. Chaperones present in chloroplasts facilitate correct folding and assembly of monoclonal antibody in transgenic chloroplasts ) and also result in fully functional human therapeutic proteins, as seen in interferon alpha and gamma (Falconer 2002 ; Leelavathi and Reddy 2003 ) . Chloroplasts have the ability to process eukaryotic proteins, including correct folding of subunits and formation of disulfi de bridges (Daniell et al. 2001b ). Chloroplast-synthesized cholera toxin-B subunit binds to the intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor, thereby confi rming the correct folding and disulfi de bond formation through functional assay (Daniell et al. 2001a ; Molina et al. 2004 ) .",

De Cosa et al. ( 2001 ) for the fi rst time expressed a complete bacterial operon in transgenic chloroplasts, resulting in the formation of stable cry2Aa2 crystals. This should facilitate expression of polyvalent vaccines or multisubunit proteins in transgenic chloroplasts (Chebolu and Daniell 2009 ).

Inspite of higher expression level gene silencing was not observed in transgenic chloroplast derived plants (De Cosa et al. 2001 ) . Chloroplasts can be a good place to store the biosynthetic products that could otherwise be harmful when accumulated in cytosol (Bogorad 2000 ) . This was demonstrated when cholera toxin B subunit was accumulated in large quantities in transgenic chloroplasts and it had no toxic effect (Daniell et al. 2001a ) , whereas when accumulated in the cytosol in very small quantities, CTB was toxic (Mason et al. 1998 ) .

Zera\u00ae (\u03b3-Zein ER-accumulating domain) is the N-terminal proline-rich domain of c-zein that is suffi cient to induce the assembly of PB formation. Fusion of the Zera\u00ae domain to proteins of interest results in assembly of dense PB-like, ER-derived organelles, containing high concentration of recombinant protein. To confi rm this, they expressed F1-V antigen protein from Yersinia pestis (causal pathogen of plague) in three plant models ( Ncotiana benthamiana , Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Nicotiana tabacum NT1 cells) with and without a fused Zera\u00ae domain. They found that F1-V protein with fused Zera\u00ae domain showed three times more accumulation in plant cells than F1-V protein alone.",

By a transient expression assay, the authors determined not only that L1 protein was capable of assemble into VLPs, maintaining its immunological properties, but that a human instead of a plant codon usage and the protein-direction to the chloroplast, were the best conditions to achieve high yields of recombinant L1 protein (11 % of TSP in transgenic tobacco). These results showed an effi cacious way of producing VLPs onward HPV vaccine, maybe a cheaper one than the new HPV vaccine produced in insect cells. Immunizing experiments are needed to better prove this hypothesis. Obregon and coworkers showed a new strategy for increasing recombinant protein production in HIV by improved the stability of p24 core protein. This stable protein formed dimmers that were retained within the cell resulting in an enhanced expression, apparently related to protein folding processing and assembly, subcellular targeting and protein stability (Obregon et al. 2006 ) . Recently, Saejung et al. ( 2007 ) reported, for the fi rst time, the production of a dengue vaccine in plants. Takagi et al.

Tomato fruits containing the TBI-HBS antigen were fed to experimental mice and, on days 14 and 28 post-feeding, high levels of HIV and HBV-specifi c antibodies were present in the serum and feces of the test animals. Intraperitoneal injection of a DNA vaccine directing synthesis of the same TBI-HBsAg antigen boosted the antibody response to HIV in the blood serum; however, it had no effect on the high level of antibodies produced to HBV. Although no plant-based edible vaccines are currently commercially available, a secretory antibody vaccine was approved in the EU, a poultry vaccine against Newcastle disease was approved by the USDA, and a hepatitis B virus vaccine using a tobacco plant has been approved in Cuba (Kim and Yang 2010 ) . Vaccines for diarrhea, hepatitis B and rabies, and antibodies for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer and dental caries, have been submitted for phase I or phase II clinical trials in humans (Ma et al. 2005 ). Korban and colleagues at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign, Ill.) have reported a plant-based oral vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in tomato fruit (Korban et al. 2002 ) with the ultimate aim of moving the product into apple. HSV is a viral pathogen that causes respiratory diseases and is a leading cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children worldwide. Aziz et al.

Apart from many advantages of these vaccines there are some very relevant social, environmental and ethical issues concerning them which are need to be addressed. Besides future research is needed to overcome limitations like low expression, immunotolerance, glycosylation, immunogenicity, and stability of the transproteins if the practical application of these vaccines is to be realized. One very important point is the proper coordination between academia and industry to help these vaccines reach people. Both technical and regulatory hurdles have to be overcome. It will be a challenge to create a positive public perception regarding safety and effi cacy of these vaccines after all the fuss created over the safety issues of transgenic crops during last few years. Lastly timely funding for this research and participation of corporate giant will certainly help in making this dream a reality soon.",

            "text": "). The study aimed to express a surface protein (spaA) from Streptococcus mutans in tobacco plants to a level of approximately 0.02 % of the total leaf protein. The gene for spa production was introduced in tobacco through Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Mice when feeded on this transgenic tobacco tissue showed oral immunogenicity to spaA protein. However these mice were not further challenged directly with the pathogen but the antibodies recovered from the mice serum demonstrated biological activity against intact S. mutans . However much needed impetus to plant derived vaccine research was given by Arntzen and co workers in 1992 by presenting the concept of plant edible vaccines. In same year an important research paper was published by Mason et al. on the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in tobacco plants",
