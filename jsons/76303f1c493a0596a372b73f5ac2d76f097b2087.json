The constraints associated with COVID-19 are a source of isolation for these persons, of remoteness for their families, and of moral constraints for health personnel committed to providing them with a satisfactory quality of life. The induced moral suffering should not be underestimated.",

However, given the sum of uncertainty that remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the population, it is difficult to anticipate the end of the crisis and the implementation of deconfinement proves to be very delicate. The simplistic temptation to manage this episode by age groups (a hypothesis already rejected by the Academy [2] ) and to impose on the elderly remaining confined in the name of their own protection is unsatisfactory.",
