Oxidative stress increases susceptibility to viral infections and successfully shown that it can be attenuated by pre-treating these deficient cells with lipoic acid (antioxidant).17 Considering that it is the most common enzymatic deficiency worldwide and in light of COVID-19, this provides a strong rationale for future studies.",
