Moreover, those that have been published, focus on subsets of FDI. This review systematically examines the empirical as well as theoretical research on FDI through an analysis of 500 articles published during the last five decades. Theoretical models, methods, context, and contributions to scholarship were reviewed. We strive to highlight the key theories, paradigms, and articles and provide directions for future research. We conclude that FDI has evolved as the most significant area of international business.",

However, most reviews of the FDI literature do typically focus on a specific subset of FDI only (e.g., Buckley & Casson, 2009; Chan, Makino & Isobe, 2006; Meyer, 2003; Blonigen, 2005; Fetscherin, Voss, & Guglier, 2010; Klier, Schwens, Zapkau, & Dikova, 2017; Paul & Benito, 2018) . For instance, Meyer (2004) surveyed the research on FDI spillovers in the context of emerging market economies. Chan et al. (2006) examined the interdependencies between FDI and MNE foreign-market-entry strategies. Blonigen (2005) reviewed past research on host-country-specific determinants of FDI. Buckley and Casson (2009) analyzed the progress of FDI research and internalization theory. Fetscherin et al. (2010) conducted an interdisciplinary literature review on FDI in China.",

In this context, our goal is to come out with the most comprehensive review of the MNE-FDI literature. We focused on FDI that occurs when MNEs invest in assets in foreign countries and establish some form of a subsidiary to execute market-seeking, strategic asset-seeking and/or efficiency-seeking activities (Dunning, 1993 (Dunning, , 1998 . With coverage of all topics under FDI, our review highlights specific gaps in the extant literature and offer directions for future research.",

Dominant theories applied were identified -including the eclectic OLI (Ownership, Location, Internalization) paradigm and internalization theory, amongst othersand provide a path to contrast the more established theories with those more recently introduced such as Conservative, Predictable and Pacemaker (CPP) model. Further, we provide a citation analysis of the most impactful articles and authors in the last five decades of research. Next, we identify the most widely used variables in FDI research such as IFDI and OFDI, locations and determinants, economic growth, FDI spillover effects, entry modes, MNE strategy, etc. Afterward, we report dominant research methodologies including statistical approaches. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research regarding theories, content, and methodology. The value of this review lies in its breadth and the exhaustiveness of the literature identified. It complements the focused sub-analysis of the past and therefore represents a valuable base reference tool for future MNE-FDI research.",

Next, we performed a keyword search across selected online databases, including Business Source Premier, JSTOR, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and Google Scholar for the articles on FDI published during the last five decades. Keywords included Foreign Direct Investment, FDI, Inward FDI, Outward FDI, Multinational Enterprise, MNE, and Foreign Subsidiary. In the first phase, we incorporated empirical papers that used at least one statistical technique based on primary or secondary data. However, based on feedback from experts, we then also included selected high-impact theoretical articles (based on citation counts-minimum 500 citations) to identify key contributions to theory.",

The time period was divided with a break in 1999 because several agencies made the online data available for researchers by the late 1990s.

Hennart (1982 Hennart ( , 1986 ) developed the internalization model further by extending it along with vertical and horizontal integration of MNE-FDI activities. This has spurred recent studies to draw on internalization theory to explain FDI in the context of regionalization and global value chain disaggregation (Rugman & Verbeke, 2003; Pak & Park, 2004; Rugman, 2010; Verbeke & Kano, 2016) .",

            "text": "OLI Paradigm: Dunning's OLI paradigm (e.g., 1988 , 2000 has been the most widely used lens in MNE-FDI research. This paradigm explains the way firms leverage resourcesnamely ownership advantages (O), location advantages (L), and internalization advantages (I) to compete in foreign locations (Dunning, 2001) . The use of the OLI paradigm remains in effect in contemporary FDI research. Over 30 studies in our sample were framed either along all three OLI dimensions or were focused on one of the dimensions in finer-grained approaches. For instance, Delevic & Heim (2017) stated that home market deficiencies are compensated by the host country's location advantages, and Cook, Pandit, Loof, & Johansson (2012) , using a geographical clustering approach for global cities, built on the L-advantages notion and found that more experienced MNEs and those with stronger home-country resource positions are more likely to engage in OFDI. One reason for the prevalence of the OLI paradigm might be that it forms a grounded starting point for developing other theories/frameworks that explain the evolving MNE-FDI phenomenon. Also, the OLI paradigm even if not represent a theory but allows linking international business phenomena with other theories -such as including transaction cost economics and the resource-based view -and also with other fields like economic geography. Despite the relevance of the OLI paradigm and its refinements, Dunning (2006) admitted that the unique context of OFDI from EMNEs could require a revision of some of its premises. Barkema, Chen, George, Luo, & Tsui (2015) pointed towards the difficulty of testing Western theories with Eastern constructs by discussing the properties of equivalence, salience, and infusion, and provided directions for creating new theories and paradigms. In addition, the OLI paradigm might not be suitable for explaining FDI patterns of new-generation firms (e.g., Cannon & Summers, 2014; Ross, 2016) such as Google, Uber, Airbnb, and Bitcoin, which are asset-light and often virtual in their internationalization approach.",

As per this theory, firms undertake exports before thinking about production abroad in the form of FDI. The PLC theory suggests that capitalintensive and technologically sophisticated innovations are typically developed for the domestic market and progress through various stages in which production shifts to other (mainly) developed countries and, finally, to developing countries; such as Contractor, Dangol, Nuruzzaman, & Raghunath (2019, p.2 ) that indicate that \"multinational companies are willing to take the risk by investing in a country with a lower institutional quality at one stage of the investment's life-cycle in exchange for a more developed institutions, or easier regulations, at another stage of the life cycle\". The scope of PLC theory is not limited to FDI research. It is being applied in other fields as well, such as marketing, where PLC theory was particularly popular in the 1980s and 1990s (Calvet, 1981; Boddewyn, 1983; Kim & Lyn, 1987; Trevi\u00f1o & Daniels, 1995) .",

Ghoshal (1987) was one of the pioneers in applying RBV to international business. The proponents of the RBV argue that firms should look internally to find the sources of competitive advantage instead of searching for it in the external competitive environment. In this approach, resources are classified as either tangible or intangible. One of the key factors is that intangible resources (such as intellectual property rights and brand equity) are the main sources of sustainable competitive advantage (Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991) . Some researchers have applied RBV in the context of OFDI from EMNEs (Cui & Jiang, 2009; Cook et. al, 2012; Lin, 2016; Gaur, Ma, & Ding, 2018) .",

With the LLL framework, Mathews (2002 Mathews ( , 2006 extended the OLI framework to EMNEs with strategic asset-seeking FDI. The LLL framework explains the way EMNEs from peripheral countries in the Asia-Pacific region established themselves successfully in more developed countries. Mathews (2002) suggested that FDI, in pursuit of new capabilities, requires a different perspective than FDI meant to exploit existing capabilities. EMNEs can develop capabilities to the maximum, such that they can globalize (Hobdari, Gammeltoft, Li, & Meyer, 2017) and, also, EMNEs engaged in OFDI from emerging countries, often, enter late to already developed markets and thus principally exhibit catch-up strategies. EMNEs frequently exhibit accelerated or even leapfrogging internationalization patterns. Most researchers have used the LLL model in the context of the internationalization of Asian firms -particularly Chinese firms. For instance, Ge and Ding (2007) applied the LLL model to demonstrate how Chinese firms, such as Galanz Group, developed unique competitive strategies that helped them succeed in foreign markets. On the other hand, Narula (2006) argued that the tenets of the LLL model are interesting, but it proposed modifications, in comparison to the OLI paradigm, seem less than convincing. Luo and Tung's (2007) Springboard Perspective explains why and how EMNEs will systematically and recursively use international expansion as a springboard to acquire critical resources for competition in their home markets with foreign MNEs from developed markets. This is a very useful tool for researchers, particularly those who examine different aspects of OFDI from EMNEs -which still lacks widespread attention. The authors have developed a general theory of springboard MNEs based on amalgamation, ambidexterity, and adaptation advantages that differentiate springboard EMNEs from more established MNEs from developed countries (Luo and Tung, 2018) . Ghemawat's (2001 Ghemawat's ( , 2003 ) CAGE (Cultural, Administrative, Geographic, Economic) Distance Framework, while being applicable to both developed and emerging country contexts, seems especially useful to understanding the internationalization processes of EMNEs. It is surprising that the CAGE framework is widely recognized but not yet widely applied. One reason for this could be that the original article did not offer easy-touse measures. However, some researchers have used the CAGE framework in their studies to analyze distance factors and MNEs' FDI (Goodall & Roberts, 2003; Rugman & Verbeke, 2004; Mudambi, 2008; Malhotra, Sivakumar, & Zhu, 2009; Juasrikul, Sahaym, Sean, & Liu, 2018) . The CAGE distance calculator has introduced a decade ago (Ghemawat, 2007) , and we expect more researchers to use this measure in the future.",

Chari (2013) found a positive relationship between business group affiliation and OFDI overall, in the case of firms from developing countries using Indian data as well as between business group affiliation and OFDI into advanced countries.

Going forward, new theory development should be at the core of future FDI research, to recognize the changes and developments in the phenomenon and taking into account potential, path, process, pattern, process and problems associated with the MNEs and FDI. These changes are driven by developments at the country level, inter-country level and, most importantly, MNE level. This seems particularly necessary, considering that prior empirical FDI research suffered to a significant extent from statistical robustness issues of the main variables.

Therefore, we call for new and novel theories to use in this area of research.

Dunning's work and Vernon's PLC theory were developed based on OFDI by MNEs from the developed world and mostly from traditional (and often manufacturing) industries, which creates only limited relevance for the aforementioned emerging phenomena. Further, research on EMNE-OFDI has so far looked at a limited number of determinants and is based on EMNE data from a very limited number of home countries (mainly China). We suggest that for EMNE research, in particular, the LLL (Mathews, 2006) , Springboard Perspective (Luo & Tung, 2007) and ADO framework (2018) Another interesting outcome from this review is that only a limited number of studies (e.g., Andersson, Forsgren, & Holm, 2002) have investigated how entry modes influence the evolution of post-FDI strategy. We suggest that utilizing contingency models from the strategy domain might create an opportunity to more accurately connect country-level and firm-level FDI research with the literature on MNE strategy. Another area of opportunity lies in comparative analyses in the context of FDI from developed countries and developing countries while drawing on existing models, including the CAGE framework (Ghemawat, 2001 (Ghemawat, , 2003 . Previous theory development has been based on the notion that most MNE-FDI is directed toward predictable markets (markets with similar features in terms of cultural, administrative, geographical, and economic distance). This notion is likely a result of firms avoiding dealing with any liability of foreignness issues, problems arising from cognitive biases, and resource constraints. Today's level of economic development of emerging markets and the level of developed market-bound investments by EMNEs (Mathews, 2006; Luo & Tung, 2007; Demirbag et al., 2009) should provide ample opportunities for such research. It is also worth extending the institutional theory and RBV in such studies. For instance, there are opportunities to develop theories and frameworks and extend the available theories to explain the FDI phenomenon of emerging market firms -in particular, Asian firms. This is true especially considering that Asia has emerged as a strategically important region. There are opportunities to develop separate frameworks to analyze the path, process, pace, pattern, problems, and potential of MNE investment concerning the past, present and future all within the context of strategy. For example, there is scope for developing theories that explain the pace of internationalization regarding entry mode switch from exporting to FDI.",

FDI hostcountry effects range from positive to insignificant, to negative -depending on the conceptual lens or the contextual setting deployed in a specific research project (e.g.Alvarez & Marin, 2013;Asiedu, Jin, & Nandwa, 2009).With the large scale emergence of EMNEs, research has gathered momentum in this area. For example, Kedia, Gaffney, and Clampit (2012) posited that an EMNE strategic orientation predicts its propensity to engage in knowledge-seeking FDI and that the type of knowledge sought predicts location choice and entry mode. In recent years, OFDI characteristics related to MNE home countries have attracted increasing attention amongst scholars(Sauvant, 2005; Kedia et al., 2012). Here, research on EMNEs is experiencing a particularly strong surge (e.g.Filatotchev et al., 2007;Bhaumik & Driffield, 2011;Cui & Jiang, 2009, 2012. Several focused journal issues and summary papers have now begun to discuss the characteristics of EMNE internationalization processes -shedding more light on the subject (e.g.,Kearney, 2012;Gray, Kumar & Mudambi, 2014;Cuervo-Cazurra, Inkpen, Musacchio, & Ramaswamy, 2014).The ratio of developing countries in global OFDI to both developed as well as other developing countries has increased considerably since 2000(UNCTAD, 2015). Outward investments by EMNEs based in developing Asia increased every year during the last 10 years. This growth was widespread, encompassing all the major Asian economies, which made developing Asia the world's largest outward investor region. EMNEs have undertaken international expansion through greenfield investments as well as cross-border acquisitions.However, it is worth noting that MNEs from the United States (US) have remained dominant in generating FDI outflows on a home-country basis(UNCTAD, 2015), which is also reflected in the number of research studies that draw on U.S. -based MNE-FDI data.",

Would they confine to Predictable markets(Paul &   Sanchz-Morcillo, 2019)  in the post-COVID-19 period?5. CONCLUSIONThe literature on MNE-FDI is quite substantial, though arguably heterogeneous, in nature. In an attempt to review 50 years of MNE-FDI research, we have provided a near-exhaustive catalog of the extant literature (See Tables 10 onwards given as online supplement). We systematically reviewed 500+ journal articles, which as a whole can be considered representative of the present body of knowledge on MNE-FDI. The review summarizes past and contemporary FDI research in the context of developed as well as developing countries.Such a large-scale approach is justified, and necessary, as existing reviews have only provided subsets without integrating the overall body of research.We identified the most commonly used theories, variables, statistical methods employed, home/host countries, and primary outlets for FDI research. We have also listed different approaches and variables used in FDI research to show their impacts on home/host countries. The most insightful and most-cited studies have developed either hypotheses or propositions about only one or two critical dimensions of FDI. These dimensions include antecedents, characteristics, and outcomes of FDI undertaken by MNEs. They also focus on the following aspects of FDI: FDI potential, path, process, pace, problems, and performance.Most authors of these most influential studies deployed advanced approaches to test hypotheses. However, the ever-greater availability of micro-level data should help future research move beyond our current state of knowledge.Overall, we found that, despite the long history of FDI research, there has been a considerable rise in academic interest and publications since 2000. This validates the notion that globalization has increased not only in momentum but also in its characteristics during the last two decades. Thus, continued pursuit of FDI research could generate meaningful contributions to scholarship, practice, and policy.From the point of view of scholarship, comparative research should identify new generalizable patterns across firms, industries, or countries: leading to the development of robust new theories. In practice, FDI research can provide better insights for decision-makers.For instance, research using firm-level data and information would help managers to make intelligent decisions on entry modes such as equity joint ventures or subsidiaries, or on formulating their strategic choice between greenfield investments or acquisitions. For policymakers, findings in new research at the country level and industry level may help in identifying the best and most appropriate policies in support of IFDI or OFDI, as well as how to cope with the increasingly difficult management of MNEs that are less home-country centric but truly transnational.",
