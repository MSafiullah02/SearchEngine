Since there are currently no effective treatments or vaccines to prevent COVID-19, focus is placed on infection prevention through social distancing and quarantine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have set forth recommendations to prevent infections in healthcare settings by decreasing or eliminating non-urgent office visits. Telehealth refers to any healthcare process that occurs remotely, including provider training or team meetings, whereas telemedicine specifically describes using technology to connect a patient to a provider. To enable patients to retain access to healthcare, many countries have revised regulations to allow health care providers to use telemedicine and receive appropriate reimbursement [1]. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the USA have broadened access to, and reimbursement for, telemedicine services, allowing Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) providers the opportunity to provide continuity of care to existing patients who would otherwise remain disconnected.",

We grouped these scenarios into diagnoses that would (1) likely require different treatment with telemedicine compared with in-person treatment or (2) would utilize accepted behavioral counseling and not deviate from current management paradigms. Expedited literature reviews were performed for four scenarios in which virtual management of patients would differ from direct visits [telemedicine in FPMRS patients, pessary management, urinary tract infection (UTIs), and urinary retention]. For scenarios in which the management via telemedicine would be similar to traditional conservative management (urinary and fecal incontinence, prolapse, defecatory dysfunction, and fecal incontinence), established algorithms and existing systematic reviews of conservative management were reviewed and summarized. Finally, expert consensus compiled and summarized the following; FPMRS conditions that are amenable to telemedicine management, urgent situations requiring in-person visits, symptoms that should alert FPMRS providers for possible COVID-19, and what FPMRS providers should consider when caring for patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19.",

            "text": "Based on review of the literature (60 articles) and expert consensus:Telemedicine with empiric antibiotic therapy is effective and lowers costs, but results in more prescribing and therefore may negatively impact antibiotic resistance [5, 8, 6, 57\u201360, 76].The symptoms of dysuria, worsening frequency or urgency, gross hematuria, and lack of vaginal symptoms are significantly predictive of the presence of a UTI [44, 61].Prior culture results within the past year correctly correspond to subsequent cultures and sensitivities and thus should be used to guide empiric therapy, even in neurogenic bladder patients [47, 48, 52, 62].Patient factors such as age (> 65 years), immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, catheter use, UTIs in the last year, and recent exposure to antibiotics should be assessed during telemedicine visits as these factors predict resistance to first-line antibiotics [45, 63, 51, 54, 64]. Fever and diabetes are risk factors for more severe infections or bacteremia and might guide treatment decisions about triage in person [43]. Providers should bear in mind that fever and various atypical symptoms may also indicate COVID-19 infection.Empiric treatments with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or nitrofurantoin are cost-effective choices [42, 56, 85\u201388]. Uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with one of the following empiric antibiotic strategies as supported by cost guidance, guidelines, and antimicrobial susceptibility: (1) TMP-SMZ 160/800 mg orally twice daily for 3 days where antibiotic resistance does not exceed 20%, (2) nitrofurantoin monohydrate macrocrystals 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days in patients with normal kidney function (CrCl > 30 ml/min), particularly if there are contraindications or high resistance to TMP-SMZ, (3) fosfomycin 3 g once, or (4) pivmecillinam 400 mg twice daily for 5 days [36, 40, 46, 50, 62, 64, 65, 38, 55, 81, 89, 53, 66, 77].Antibiotic durations of 3\u20137 days are advisable and have better efficacy than single-dose therapy (with the exception of fosfomycin, which is an efficacious single dose regimen) [67, 72, 90].Fluoroquinolone therapy should be reserved for higher-risk patients, locales where antibiotic resistance to alternative agents (particularly TMP-SMZ) exceeds 20%, or when poor kidney function is known in the patient [39, 41, 68, 78\u201381, 91].Complicated UTIs in the current pandemic merit empiric treatment with a broader spectrum systemic fluoroquinolone antibiotic course to decrease hospital admissions, with plans to proceed to admission for parenteral antibiotics if severe symptoms occur or lack of response to oral antibiotics (e.g., intolerance to oral intake, high fever, severe pain, disorientation) [49, 69, 70, 92].Elderly patients and patients with diabetes should be given broader spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins or fluoroquinolone therapy) for longer durations (7 days vs. single dose vs. 3 days) [53, 66, 71\u201373, 82, 83].Relief of symptoms can be used as a surrogate for UTI resolution in this pandemic (EC).Other strategies to avoid antibiotics could include fluid hydration, cranberry supplements, or bladder soothants (e.g., phenazopyridine) (EC).Laboratory alternatives include over-the-counter urine dipstick products, urine PCR [74], or utilizing remote laboratory locations to minimize exposure in hospital settings (EC).Strategies to avoid UTIs that do not require in-person visits include vaginal estrogen or use of D-mannose 1000 mg twice daily [75] (EC).Recurrent UTI patients may be offered patient-initiated treatment based on past urine cultures, as supported by grade C evidence in the AUA/CUA/SUFU guidelines. They further recommend culture with every episode but this may be suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic when the risk of healthcare exposure outweighs the need for culture [65] (EC).",

            "text": "Based on review of the literature (23 articles) and expert consensus:Chronic urinary retention (PVR > 300 ml for > 6 months) puts patients at risk of upper urinary tract injury. Imaging and/or laboratory evaluation along with appropriate catheterization should be considered [111].Factors that suggest a patient is at low risk for postoperative urinary retention (following pelvic surgery) include: voiding > 200 ml after being retrograde filled with 300 ml, voiding > 50% of the retrograde-filled volume, and women who subjectively feel that the postoperative force of their urinary stream is at least 50% of their baseline force of stream [102, 108, 112].Regional anesthesia is unlikely to substantially increase the risk of postoperative urinary retention and can be considered for vaginal surgery in an effort to decrease the potential risk of aerosolization of COVID-19 with general anesthesia [113] (EC).Clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) may be preferable to an indwelling catheter for urinary retention when possible [104, 107, 108]. Risk factors that predict poor success with CISC include obesity, poor dexterity, cognitive impairment, and pain with catheterization [105\u2013107].When patients call with symptoms of possible urinary retention, consider instruction in behavioral modification prior to recommending CISC. This includes encouraging the patient to create a relaxing environment with adequate time for voiding while taking slow deep breaths and relaxing their pelvic floor muscles [94]. Patients could also be instructed to double or triple void [116] or in the use of the Crede maneuver (expert consensus).If behavioral modifications fail, patients should be given the option of CISC. A prescription for catheters can be called into a pharmacy (delivery may be available), and remote teaching of the CISC technique can be attempted. If video conferencing is available, patients could be taught to use a clean technique with a mirror. Initially, the patient lies down and inserts a small-gauge (e.g., 10, 12, or 14 French) catheter. When proficient with the mirror, she can be instructed to insert the catheter by feel in the sitting or standing position. Online instructional videos are also available (https://vimeo.com/261183016) [95, 117] and online patient handouts are available as well (https://www.yourpelvicfloor.org/media/Intermittent_Self_Catheterization.pdf) [13] (https://www.voicesforpfd.org/assets/2/6/ISC.pdf) [13, 14] (EC).Patients with postoperative urinary retention who need indwelling catheterization can be instructed regarding safe removal of the catheter on postoperative day 7 at home without an office visit by cutting the balloon port and/or desufflating the catheter balloon. Consider having the patient remove the catheter early in the day to allow for an in-person office visit later on the same day if necessary [114].While antibiotics may reduce the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria during short-term catheter use, there is no strong evidence supporting the use of prophylactic antibiotics after hospital discharge in women being catheterized for postoperative urinary retention [96, 97].Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely used in patients with long-term catheterization, and there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about routine catheter change (e.g., every 2\u20134 weeks) in patients with long-term indwelling transurethral catheterization [115].There is no strong evidence supporting the use of oral medication (e.g., alpha-adrenergic antagonists) in the treatment of voiding dysfunction or urinary retention in women [93, 99, 100].",

When a provider is considering the necessity of an in-office visit, they must weigh the risks of COVID-19 exposure taking into account the current status of the outbreak in that specific region, the severity of the patient complaint, as well as the age and comorbidities of the patient. It appears that older age, diabetes, and immunosuppression increase the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection [138]. As there are no guidelines on clinic visits during a pandemic for this specialty, group consensus was obtained, and a list of reasons that may require an in-person visit was generated (Table 2). Providers should also consider a clinic visit if there is a reasonable chance a physical examination or office diagnostic testing may change the course of treatment for an urgent complaint. One must also consider that the course of the COVID-19 pandemic will change over time, which might impact these recommendations.",

A brief review of perioperative considerations for non-elective cases including COVID-19 positive cases was generated (Table 3) [141, 142]. When discussing surgical intervention with patients negative for COVID-19 infection, surgeons should discuss the unique risks of nosocomial COVID-19 infection during the consent process, including the efforts undertaken to protect the patient and the challenges of preventing contamination. Also consideration should be placed on ERAS and same-day discharge to decrease risk and exposure to patients.",
