Till August 7th in 2003, the epidemic has been dispersed into 34 countries and regions within the short period of 6 months. The number of the cumulative suspected cases reached 8347. 916 people were dead. In that period, the freedom of travel for most people was restricted. The activity of economy and trade was severely affected. Take the Far East as an example, the estimated economic loss reached 30 billion dollars [1].",

After evaporation, they will become aerosols with smaller diameter, i.e., the so-called airborne droplet nuclei. When they enter into the flow stream of recirculation air, the complexity and risk of transmission for Coronavirus will be increased. Therefore, it is necessary to control the exhaust air in the long distance, such as the influence of exhaust air from sewerage at Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong. It is also necessary to isolate in short distance or take primary isolation measures, which can be proved by the reality that most medical personnel close to SARS infected patients got infected.",
