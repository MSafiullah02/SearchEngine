Bats, camels (direct contact or by camel milk), and close contact with an infected person has been identified as a mode of transmission of the virus. Other animal reservoirs are not excluded from the possibility of being the host (Elbur et al. 2016). Dromedaries and camels are still considered as the main animal reservoirs due to their high prevalence in the Arabian Peninsula (Memish et al. 2014). Human-to-human transmission in healthcare workers, due to overcrowding, has a role in disease transmission. The disease spreads through large respiratory droplets (\u226510 \u03bcm in diameter), fomites, and hand contamination (Seto et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific drug treatment or vaccination. Therefore, infection control measures are essential for the prevention of its spread in healthcare facilities, as well as in the community (Joshi 2013). Several studies in KSA were conducted among healthcare workers and medical students for measuring the awareness of MERS-Cov according to their sociodemographic states (Al-Mohrej and Agha 2017; Kharma et al. 2015; Alsahafi and Cheng 2016; Khan et al. 2014). Moreover, awareness towards MERS-CoV was not acknowledgeable among the Saudi population. A previous study on the disease was limited due to the insignificant number of participants (Kharma et al. 2015). Unfortunately, although Al-Jouf region has been considered as one of the most vulnerable areas, suspected to be due to the abruptness of MERS-CoV outbreaks, there was a lack of previous studies detecting the degree of awareness among the Al-Jouf population. Hence, we can say that the assessment of public awareness in Al-Jouf region through this survey is reasonable. So, the goal of this research was to assess (to the best of our knowledge), for the first time, the current level of awareness towards MERS in relation to sociodemographic states among the Al-Jouf region population through a well-designed multistage questionnaire (supplementary material 1).",

The possible responses regarding disease knowledge were classified as \u2018correct\u2019, \u2018incorrect\u2019, and \u2018I do not know\u2019. A correct answer was given 1 point, while both incorrect and \u2018I do not know\u2019 responses were assigned 0 points. The higher the score, the greater the expected knowledge the respondent had. The results of the test were represented as follows: 21\u201325, excellent knowledge; 16\u201320, good knowledge; 11\u201315, moderate knowledge; 6\u201310, fair knowledge; and 0\u20135, poor knowledge. The questionnaire was validated for its reliability, resulting in a statistical value of 0.90 (Cronbach\u2019s alpha). The questionnaire was reviewed and validated by three experts in the microbiology, internal medicine, and biostatistics fields. A pilot study (tested with a group of 15 people) was done to ensure applicability of the questionnaire and to estimate the time frame needed to complete it. The questionnaires were handed out by the investigators at the site personally and collected from the respondents after they had been completed individually and anonymously. All questionnaires were attached with a greeting letter detailing the purpose of the study and informed the participants that their participation is optional, with the right of withdrawal at any stage of the study.",

As it was difficult for female researchers to reach these areas, due to conservative customs and traditions of the Al-Jouf community, we thought of sending the questionnaire by mail. However, it would have been troublesome, considering that the questionnaire might be misplaced during delivery and that many of the rural villages do not have postal systems.Difficulty in obtaining the full patient data at the hospital in Al-Jouf prevented the researchers from assessing the relationship between corona disease and other risk factors to determine a cause\u2013effect relationship.",

However, the university medical campaign has an unremarkable role in increasing MERS-CoV awareness in the future.Although the Al-Jouf public awareness level is generally good, it is less than expected, especially in regards to the modes of transmission by bats and domestic animals, incubation period, and epidemiology of the disease (especially to the neighboring countries of Jordan and Lebanon), which is still weak and insufficient, so we suggest increasing the level of awareness towards them.Public health education programs have confirmed their value in increasing the awareness of MERS-Cov disease. Consequently, the Ministry of Health should expand its awareness role through providing the media, schools and health centers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations with adequate and sound information and educational materials about the disease features and preventive measures. In addition to this, cooperation with the university medical research centers to invent new preventive and control agents is necessary.Health workers can provide public awareness and reach target groups through public health campaigns. So, improving their skills through an orientation training course about MERS-CoV disease might help to control disease outbreaks.Despite some limitations posed by this investigation, the results provided useful inputs and knowledge that would help the government in planning, designing, and initiating programs to help in MERS-CoV disease control and prevention.",
