In addition to the Cyps, two other families of proteins, FKBPs and parvulins (Fig. 1), have been described with similar PPIase activity.8 Inhibition of the PPIase activity of FKBPs by either FK506 or rapamycin was shown to be required for the immunosuppressive activity of these compounds.9 The parvulins are responsible for the cis-trans isomerization of PO3H2Ser (PO3H2Thr)-Pro bonds; however, they are much less well studied.10 One key member of the parvulin class, Pin1, interacts with phosphoproteins involved in the cell cycle of some cancer cells;10 however, the lack of potent and selective inhibitors for parvulins has limited research in this area.10, 11\n",

A resistance mutation to the Cyp inhibitor Alisporivir, occurring near the cleavage site of the NS5A\u2013NS5B polyprotein, resulted in delayed processing of the protein and impaired replication activity.24b This suggests that CypA may be required to allow the NS5A\u2013NS5B protein to achieve the required conformation to allow effective cleavage. The virus may escape the need for CypA at a specific location by mutation of residues close to the cleavage site that introduce more conformational flexibility, however this comes at a cost to the virus of impaired replication capacity. The high barrier to resistance to a Cyp inhibitor may result from the need for multiple virus mutations to appear to escape the need for all CypA mediated reorganizations, with each mutation incurring a replication \u2018fitness\u2019 cost.",

Modifications to residues in the CN binding domain (4, 5, 6, and 7), on the other hand, influence Cyp binding indirectly through effects on conformation, but often exert a more profound affect on CN binding. The (4R)-4-[(E)-2-butenyl]-4-methyl-l-threonine (MeBmt) group at position 1 is unique in that it resides in the Cyp binding domain, yet its sidechain drapes across the CsA scaffold and ultimately into the CN binding domain (Fig. 4\n). In general, modifications to MeBmt tend to decrease Cyp binding. Removing or altering the stereochemistry of the 2-methyl group reduces activity, as does introducing a second methyl group at this position.54 Likewise, removing, replacing, or capping the 3\u2032-hydroxy as an ester also reduces potency.55 One case in which Cyp binding is actually improved is when the C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC double bond is replaced with a bioisosteric sulfur atom (\u2018MeThiaBmt\u2019), which was found to bind to Cyp with 178% of the affinity of CsA itself.54b\n",

Host Cyps are clearly hijacked by several viruses to enable effective replication, and Cyp inhibition offers a promising new approach to antiviral therapy. The additional finding that Cyp inhibition plays a role in uncloaking a virus (HCV) to immune surveillance is potentially exciting; however, discovery efforts in this field are likely to be challenging, as many in vitro virus infection screening systems are successful due to an immunological defect that renders the host cell permissive to viral infection.",

As the biology of Cyps continues to unfold, the challenges to medicinal chemistry will be to discover compounds that can selectively inhibit members of the Cyp family, and to use these tools to validate the role of Cyps in disease states and as leads for drug discovery efforts. While CsA has served admirably as the starting point for Cyp research, little selectivity within the Cyp family has been described for derivatives of this compound. New inhibitory templates are beginning to appear that may deliver improved selectivity; however, the application of fragment-based screening, with the aid of available structural data to support the location of binding, should allow inhibitors to be designed that exploit regions of the Cyp protein that differ among family members.",
