Furthermore, the patient should be scheduled as the last one of the day, in order to avoid cross infection. All patients and accompanying persons must wear a protective mask during the entire examination. It is important to try to shorten the examination time and limit the patients' activities.",

If special treatments (such as sputum aspiration and specimen collection) are performed in an emergency, upgraded protections for respiratory and eyes are necessary [7] .

In our department, patients are required to perform chest CT and RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, to exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19 before radiopharmaceutical imaging. In non-endemic areas, it is also necessary to recognize and classify all patients, verify the history and clinical symptoms of every patient. We hope our experience could help to safely conduct the nuclear medicine work, reduce the risk of disease transmission, and guarantee the medical quality and safety.
