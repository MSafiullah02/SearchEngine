In most cases, estimates and actual probabilities remained close to each other, affirming the law of power-law distribution. However, in the cases of property damage caused by natural disasters, the model in this research tended to overestimate the probability of a major-scale natural disasters' occurrence than that of the reality. The collections of overestimated events showed linear relations on two sections of the log-log graph, thus showing the pattern of a double power-law distribution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 161, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 169, "end": 175, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 180, "end": 187, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 260, "end": 266, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 431, "end": 437, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 581, "end": 587, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 709, "end": 715, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Power-Law Distributed Disasters"}, {"text": "The estimated \u03b1-value from the power-law distribution indicates the extent of inverse proportion between the probability of disaster occurrence and the magnitude of disaster damage. The larger the \u03b1-value, the less likely a disaster of a given size is to occur; it may suggest that the \u03b1-value shows how vulnerable a nation is to large scale disasters. In Korea, the \u03b1-value in the power-law function of the death toll and the probability of occurrence of natural disasters was 1.97. For future study, it is worthwhile to compare it to the \u03b1-values of other regions and countries listed in Becerra et al. (2006) (i.e., world average \u00bc 1.73, North America \u00bc 2.13, South America \u00bc 1.68, Asia-Oceania \u00bc 1.69, Africa \u00bc 1.66, and the European Union \u00bc 1.73). According to Becerra and others' (2006) result, most of \u03b1-values lie between 1.6 and 1.75. The high \u03b1-value of 2.13 of North America are inferred to be due to the relatively low number of observations for North America or high incomes and low population density (Becerra et al. 2006 ).
