The virus is also implicated in respiratory tract infections of growing calves and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle (Saif, 2010, Storz et al., 2000). Some BCoV virus strains may also be responsible for simultaneous enteric and respiratory tract infections (Decaro et al., 2008a). Although BCoV infections have a high morbidity that may reach 100%, it rarely causes death. However, the economic losses are substantial in dairy and beef farms due to sudden and dramatic reduction in milk production and loss of body weight (Svensson et al., 2003, Traven et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The current measures used for BCoV diagnosis consist mostly of the detection of viral RNA by conventional and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amer and Almajhdi, 2011, Decaro et al., 2008b, Takiuchi et al., 2006). Samples collected from animals in the field are sent to the laboratory for testing as mobile real-time PCR is rarely available, complex technically and expensive. Therefore, a portable, simple, rapid nucleic acid detection test, and accurate as PCR is needed to detect the virus at the site where infections occur. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification and detection technology (Piepenburg et al., 2006). In contrast to PCR, amplification depends on a specific combination of enzymes and proteins (recombinase, single strand binding protein, and strand displacing DNA polymerase) used at a constant temperature (Euler et al., 2012a, Euler et al., 2012b). Real-time detection of the amplification process is contingent on RPA exo probes and the fluorescence signal is measured in real-time via a simple point-of-care scanner weighing only 1.2 kg including a laptop computer (ESEQuant Tubescanner device, QiagenLake Constance GmbH, Stockach, Germany). In this report, the development of a real-time RT-RPA assay for rapid, simple and portable detection of BCoV in field samples was described.",

The diagnostic difficulty of BCoV is exaggerated by its fastidious growth in cell culture and the relative inaccuracy of most utilized serological assays (Clark, 1993). Molecular approaches including conventional gel-based, nested/semi-nested, and real-time RT-PCR have proved extremely expedient for BCoV detection (Amer and Almajhdi, 2011, Decaro et al., 2008b, Fukuda et al., 2012, Park et al., 2007, Takiuchi et al., 2006, Zhu et al., 2011). However, they require expensive high-precision instruments, considerable expertise, complex optimized experimental setup and specific well-equipped laboratories. Therefore, these assays are not suitable for field use and point-of-care applications.",

As they maintain the higher sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR, the use of isothermal amplification approaches in on-site screening could improve the diagnostic procedures for acute infections. Established isothermal amplification methods include transcription mediated amplification, nucleic acid sequence based amplification, strand displacement methods as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification methods, helicase dependent amplification, hybridization chain reaction and RPA (Chang et al., 2012, Gill and Ghaemi, 2008, Kim and Easley, 2011). These methods differ in terms of complexity (number of enzymes, primers and/or probes), sensitivity, specificity, speed, contamination risk, portability, and commercial availability. Compared to other isothermal amplification techniques, RPA requires no initial heating for DNA denaturation and the target is amplified exponentially at a constant low temperature (37\u201342 \u00b0C). Together with the availability of assay reagents in a dry pellet form and the use of a battery-charged portable instrument (ESEQuant tubescanner), RPA may be the most applicable approach for field diagnosis of infectious diseases.",

It was designed to target the nucleocapsid (N) gene, which is highly conserved among BCoV strains and of which the subgenomic RNA is the most abundant in coronavirus-infected cells (Spaan et al., 1988). The assay showed a distinct specificity, reproducibility and an analytical sensitivity of 103 copies of the DNA plasmid standard. In this study, an RT-RPA assay for the detection of BCoV was developed targeting the same gene. RNA standard was generated for better evaluation of the assay performance. While real-time RT-PCR assay maintained the same analytical sensitivity (103 copies) using the RNA standard, RT-RPA achieved an improved analytical sensitivity (Fig. 1A and B) of 19 molecules detected as determined by probit regression analysis (Fig. 1C). The assay was shown to be reproducible throughout 8 test runs and linear over a range of 7 orders of magnitude, from 101 to 107 RNA copies (Fig. 1A). The diagnostic applicability of the developed RT-RPA assay under field conditions was further validated by testing 30 bovine clinical samples as compared to real-time RT-PCR. The results of both assays were similar for all samples and the values of threshold time (in RT-RPA) and threshold cycles (in real-time RT-PCR) were highly compatible expect for only one sample (Fig. 2).",
