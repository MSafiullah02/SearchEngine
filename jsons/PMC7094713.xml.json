Also noted were new mild reticulonodular opacities. No evidence of enlarged thoracic lymphadenopathy or lung masses was observed. A left thoracentesis revealed 200 mL of pale yellow exudative fluid without evidence of lymphocytosis. Cytology of the pleural fluid did not reveal malignant cells. Because of these negative results, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung biopsy was performed (Figs 2\nA-C).",

The donor in this case was younger than 20 years of age and had no risk factors for malignancy. The recipient, however, had a 30 pack-year history of smoking. The native lung explant originally showed no evidence of cancer and was reviewed again with the same conclusion; therefore, this adenocarcinoma most likely originated in the recipient after lung transplantation. The patient and his family opted for comfort care measures once the diagnosis was made and the patient was transferred to hospice services. He died 2 days later.",

Differential diagnoses in lung transplant recipients include a broad range of opportunistic infections, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and malignancy (from pulmonary and nonpulmonary origins). A high index of suspicion is required given the rapid progression of malignancy in these immunosuppressed patients and the associated poor clinical outcomes.\n3.\nLymphangitic carcinomatosis is a rare primary presentation of lung cancer and is generally seen in an advanced disease state. Diagnosis of lymphangitic carcinomatosis is challenging in lung transplant recipients, and differential diagnoses may include acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection, pulmonary edema, CMV pneumonitis, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, malignancy (from a pulmonary or an extrapulmonary source) and, rarely, recurrence of the primary lung disease (eg, sarcoidosis). Tissue biopsy via bronchoscopy or thoracoscopy is often required to establish the diagnosis.\n\n",
