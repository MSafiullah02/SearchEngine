SUMOylation requires a consensus sequence in substrates (\u03c8KXE), where \u03c8 is a hydrophobic residue and X is any amino acid. SUMOylation of transcription factors generally results in transcriptional repression, but it can also affect nuclear import and export of proteins [14]. ISG15 is a potent antiviral molecule, which is produced after interferon signaling [17]. It is conjugated co-translationally to newly synthesized proteins to inhibit viral replication, however it also likely has anti-inflammatory effects [18], [19]. General functions of all UBLs are listed in Fig. 1C [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].",

            "text": "Not only conjugation of ubiquitin and UBLs regulates innate immune responses, deconjugation is also a critical component of the system. Approximately 100 ubiquitin and UBL deconjugating enzymes (DUBs) have been identified in the human genome [29]. DUBs are required for generating the mature forms of ubiquitin and UBLs by cleavage of precursor proteins, thereby exposing the C-terminal glycine residue required for conjugation. Additionally, DUBs function in the reversion of regulatory ubiquitin and UBL conjugation (Fig. 1C). They are often specific for a certain UBL, the ubiquitin chain topology and the substrate [29]. DUBs are therefore an integral part of the regulation of the signaling cascades in which ubiquitin conjugation plays a role, which includes several innate immune response pathways. Several classes of DUBs have been recognized [30], and in the case of innate immune regulation, the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) DUBs seem to play a major role. Among them are DUBA, OTUB1, OTUB2 and A20 [31], [32], [33]. Another DUB that is critical in the regulation of the innate immune response is CYLD, which belongs to the USP DUB class [34]. Since so many enzymes are involved in the conjugation and deconjugation, post-translational modification by ubiquitin and UBLs allows for precise and dynamic adjustment of signaling pathways and their ultimate effect in the (infected) organism.",

            "text": "Although the ability to effectively mount an immune response during infection is critical for survival, prolonged or excessive-activation of the innate immune system can have detrimental effects. For example, highly pathogenic influenza virus strains, such as the 1918 H1N1 \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 virus and several highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, are potent activators of pro-inflammatory genes. The resulting \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 during infection is thought to contribute to the high mortality associated with these viruses [52]. In addition, regulation of the innate immune system is important to prevent the development of auto-immunity. Several immune disorders, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's Disease, Blau syndrome, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, have been linked to dysregulation of the innate immune system [53], [54]. Only for a few of these diseases some aspects of the underlying immune dysregulation have been identified. For example, a link between mutations in the cytosolic NOD2 sensor and susceptibility for developing Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome has been found [53], [55]. Also, increased levels of IFN-\u03b1 have been detected in SLE patients, which correlated with severity of the disease [56]. Onset of type I diabetes could be delayed in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, which spontaneously develop type I diabetes, by blocking the IFNAR, suggesting that IFN signaling plays a role in determining type I diabetes onset and progression [57]. In these mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the pancreatic draining lymph nodes produced higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 compared to control mice, which led to activation of CD4 T Cells and subsequent development of disease [57]. Determining what activates the type I interferon system and why it has adverse effects involved in these diseases will help in the development of new, more specific treatments with less side-effects than current immunosuppressive drugs used to treat some of these diseases.",

The regulatory domain can recognize the 5\u2032-triphosphate on viral RNA, after which this domain is ubiquitylated by Riplet with a K63 chain (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) [41], [58]. This leads to a conformational change in the RIG-I molecule followed by exposure of the N-terminal CARD domains. TRIM25 subsequently binds to the first CARD domain via its SPRY domain and is required for downstream signaling [59].

One possibility to explain this apparent discrepancy could be that ubiquitin chains covalently attached to K172 facilitate the binding or synthesis of unanchored ubiquitin chains, and therefore both observations may not be necessarily mutually exclusive to describe the mechanism of RIG-I regulation by ubiquitin. Mutation of K172 decreased RIG-I ubiquitylation [60], which is seemingly more consistent with a model of covalent ubiquitin conjugation to this lysine in RIG-I. Apart from the suggested role of TRIM25 in the ubiquitin conjugation to K172 [60] however, also Riplet was reported to conjugate K63-chains to K154, K164 and K172 in the CARD domains of RIG-I, which was required for downstream signaling [64], and which could therefore also explain the loss of ubiquitylation after K172 mutation.",

TRAF6 is anchored to the TLR signaling complex at the plasma membrane by IRAK proteins and by TRAF3, which in that case has a role as a scaffolding protein distinct from its E3 ligase functions (Fig. 2) [81].

A20 also possesses E3-ligase activity, which specifically modifies RIP1 with a K48 chain targeting it for proteasomal degradation, providing an interesting dual function of both E3-ligase and DUB to serve two complementary roles in negatively regulating TAK1 activation [82].

Since free chains do not \u201cencode\u201d any other signal than the linkage specificity, the question arises: what makes chains from TRIM25 activate RIG-I and chains from TRIM5a activate the TAK1 complex? One possibility is that these free chains are very volatile signals that can rapidly activate a signaling complex and are subsequently degraded by the DUBs present in the cytosol. Since in vitro most DUBs can efficiently break down purified free ubiquitin chains (depending on chain topology in some cases) it is likely that free K63 chains are degraded rapidly after synthesis and present a very dynamic mechanism for signaling complex activation [84]. Since DUBs have been reported as integral components of large ubiquitylation complexes, it is also not unconceivable that ubiquitin chains function within the complexes they were synthesized in and do not \u2018float\u2019 around free in the cytosol where they could engage unintended targets. Along those lines, one would predict that the number and activity of the conjugating and de-conjugating enzymes within those complexes establish an equilibrium between continuous synthesis and degradation of ubiquitin chains. Such an equilibrium could be very transiently and rapidly shifted \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 by modifying the number and the activity of the different enzymes in the protein complex or disengaging the intended target of the ubiquitin chains.",

Since IKK is activated by phosphorylation of the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 subunits and TAK1 is capable of phosphorylating those subunits in vitro (a catalytic mutant was unable to do so), a model was proposed in which TAK1 phosphorylates IKK\u03b2 [71]. In contrast, activation and auto-phosphorylation of the IKK complex by binding of free ubiquitin chains to NEMO has been proposed based on in vitro studies [13]. Contrary to the requirement of K63 chains for TAK1 activation, the activation of IKK was independent of K48 or K63 linked ubiquitin. Moreover, the E2-enzyme involved was identified as UbcH5 (instead of Uev1A-Ubc13), which forms chains of various linkages. This suggested that distinct ubiquitin chain types could be involved. Moreover, due to the ability of NEMO to both bind and be modified by linear ubiquitin chains, it is possible that chains bound to one NEMO subunit are recognized by another and then oligomerize due to this interaction. This could then lead to auto-phosphorylation of the bound IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 subunits similarly to how TAK1 can activate itself in vitro\n[13].

One caveat to this approach is that it obscures the role of NEMO and the IKK complex in other parts of the signaling cascades controlling innate immunity. Most knowledge about the activation of the IKK complex is inferred from the canonical pathway, yet the exact functions of NEMO in each different pathway remain unclear. It is not unlikely that as a results of multiple signaling cascades culminating in the activation of the IKK complex (TNF\u03b1, TLR signaling, CD40, IL-1, etc.), each pathway differs slightly in its method for activating the IKK complex. Due to the promiscuity of the interaction of NEMO with different ubiquitin chain linkages, as well as the various modifications of the protein itself, different ubiquitin signals could provide an interesting angle for differential and dynamic IKK complex activation.",

However, functions specific for either TBK1 or IKK\u025b have been discovered since [49], [94]. For example, results from IKK\u025b knock-out mice have suggested a predominant role in the activation of STAT1 following IFNAR signaling [94]. While TBK1 has been linked to selective autophagy of intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella [95]. How the functions of IKK\u025b and TBK1 relate to each other and how their respective functions fit together remains to be elucidated. For downstream signaling, TBK1 also requires K63-ubiquitylation by mind bomb proteins after dsRNA signaling and by Nrdp1 after LPS signaling [96], [97]; yet the major activator for IKK\u025b is still unknown (Fig. 3C).

Taken together, LUBAC has so far been found to positively regulate NF-\u03baB signaling (Fig. 2), but negatively regulate antiviral signaling (Fig. 3A and C). These findings indicate that LUBAC is involved in directing the innate immune response to a more pro-inflammatory instead of antiviral response. An E3 ligase that has the opposite effect is Nrdp1, which activates TBK1, but targets TLRs for degradation by K48-linked ubiquitylation [96].

Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 can form homo- or heterodimers, each of which has different promoter specificity. IRF3 homodimers are created when there is a low supply of IRF7 (so in the absence of ISG expression) and initiate production of chemokines such as CXCL10 to attract innate immune cells. Conversely, IRF3/IRF7 dimers potently activate type I interferon production, but this can only occur in innate immune cells or cells already stimulated with type I interferon [50].

Studies using TRIM21 knockout mice found that loss of TRIM21 increases NF-\u03baB dependent cytokine expression in embryonic fibroblasts, yet no effects were observed in vivo\n[106]. The net result of TRIM21 activity is therefore still uncertain, and variations in cell types used or different isoforms of TRIM21 might explain its different functions.

Both IRF3 and IRF7 contain SUMO consensus sequences, which have been shown to be SUMOylated during viral infection, thereby providing a mechanism for post-activation attenuation by transcriptional repression [107]. TRIM28 was identified as the E3-ligase for IRF7 SUMOylation, yet a SUMO E3 ligase for IRF3 has hitherto not been identified [108]. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT\u03b3 (PIAS\u03b3) was also found to inhibit the transcriptional activity of both NF-\u03baB as well as transcription factors binding the ISRE (IRF7 and ISGF3) [109]. Members of the PIAS protein family are SUMO E3-ligases and are involved in the regulation of a variety of innate immunity transcription factors [110]. The PIAS proteins were identified as inhibitors of STAT proteins, possibly by prohibiting interaction of STAT with DNA or other co-factors through protein\u2013protein interactions. However, the biological relevance of the SUMO E3-ligase function of the PIAS proteins remains unclear. Since the exact mechanism by which SUMO functions as a transcriptional repressor is not yet fully understood, more factors affecting SUMO-dependent regulation of IRF3 and IRF7 are likely to exist.",

Ectopic expression of these viral DUBs increases global ubiquitin and ISG15 deconjugation, however, it remains to be determined how the promiscuous activity of these enzymes is regulated during infection. Viral proteases of arteriviruses are able to inhibit RIG-I activation by deconjugating the K63 chains required for RIG-I activation [116], and more targets within the innate immune response cascades are likely to exist. Other examples of viral proteins interfering with the function of E3-ligases exist, such as Influenza A Virus NS1, which specifically binds TRIM25 thereby inhibiting RIG-I activation [117]. Some large DNA viruses, such as herpes- and poxviruses even encode their own E3 ligases. Herpesviral E3s target the cellular E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168 for degradation, which has been proposed to facilitate reactivation from latency [118], [119].
