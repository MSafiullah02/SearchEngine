The RV genome comprises a structural (VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1) and non-structural (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) region flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) [1,2]. Recently, a genotypic classification of RVs based on the VP1 sequence was proposed. According to this classification, more than 160 types of RVs have been classified into three species (A, B, and C) (available online: http://www.picornaviridae.com/) [3]. Receptors of RV-A and -B are intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family members [4,5], whereas those of RV-C comprise the recently identified human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3), expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells [6,7].

To date, it has been reported that RV-C can be propagated in sinus organ culture, air\u2013liquid\u2013interface (ALI) cultured differentiated human airway epithelial cells, and commercially available three-dimensional (3D) human upper airway epithelia reconstituted in vitro [14,15,16,17]. These systems have provided an important tool for RV-C research. However, isolation of a sufficient number of sinus organs for culture and the stable culture of differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells are difficult. In addition, commercially available 3D human upper airway epithelial cells are costly, and only a few clinical isolates, RV-C2, -C7, -C12, -C15, and -C29, have been isolated using this method; of these, only RV-C7 and -C29 have been passaged and re-propagated [17]. Therefore, the isolation of RV-Cs from clinical specimens in order to gain a better understanding of their biological properties and pathogenesis requires stable and inexpensive culture systems.",

Briefly, the 10 \u03bcL assay contained 5 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer, 0.4 \u03bcL of 25\u00d7 RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 1.4 \u03bcL of primers/probe mix, 0.2 \u03bcL of water, and 3 \u03bcL of template RNA. The primer/probe mix was prepared to contain 0.6 \u00b5M of each primer and 0.1 \u00b5M of the probe. To prepare the RNA transcript control, the 5\u2032UTR region of RV-A16 was amplified by RT-PCR, and the resulting PCR product containing the T7 promoter was then transcribed in vitro. The 5\u2032UTR region was amplified by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with paired primers (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTACWCTRKTAYTMYGGTAMYYTTGTACGCC and AGWGCATCKGGYAAYTTCCA). RNA was transcribed using the T7 RiboMAX\u2122 Express Large-Scale RNA Production System (Promega) and treated with TURBO\u00ae DNase to degrade the template DNA. The dNTPs and NTPs were removed using MicroSpin G-25 Columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The transcribed RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and the absorbance value was used to calculate the copy numbers of the transcribed RNA. The integrity of the transcribed RNAs was assessed via a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).",

In this study, HBEC3-KT and HSAEC1-KT cells were cultured under ALI conditions using Transwell Permeable Supports and PneumaCult ALI medium and differentiated into pseudostratified epithelia with cilia and goblet cells (Figure 1). Although no obvious morphological differences were observed between HBEC3- and HSAEC1-ALI cultures, RV-C9, -C53, and -A16 propagated well in HBEC3-ALI cultures (Figure 2A\u2013C), whereas only RV-A16 propagated well in HSAEC1-ALI cultures (Figure S1A\u2013C). Considering these results, the different RV-C growth properties between HBEC3- and HSAEC1-ALI cultures were not dependent on cell morphology, and therefore other unknown host cell factor(s) might be responsible for the differences. Further studies are needed to elucidate such discrepancies.",

The mean RNA copy numbers of RV genome in the 11 clinical specimens from which the viruses were successfully isolated was 7.07 log10 copies/inoculation (Figure 4). Considering that RNA copy numbers in the 11 specimens from which the viruses were successfully isolated were significantly higher, it is surmised that we failed to isolate RV-Cs from the other 12 clinical specimens partly because they contained lower concentrations of RV-C. The clinical isolate 47-SGH-JPN-2015 was isolated from the same clinical specimen as that of RV-C9 using ALI-cultured HBTE cells. Similarly, 4-SGH-JPN-2015 was isolated from the same clinical specimen as that of RV-C53. It was shown that there were no differences between the VP1 sequences of RV-C9 and -C53, as determined by NGS (accession numbers, LC428175 and LC428176) and between those of 4-SGH-JPN-2015 and 47-SGH-JPN-2015, as determined by Sanger sequencing (accession numbers, LC428172 and LC428173). These results suggest that our established HBEC3-ALI culture did not affect the VP1 sequence. Moreover, it is speculated that the same strain might be isolated from a clinical specimen using either HBEC3-ALI culture or ALI-cultured HBTE cells.",
