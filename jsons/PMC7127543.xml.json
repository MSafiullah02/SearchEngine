These receivers were connected to the hospital's local area network (LAN). The system worked in such a way that temperature readings and RFID numbers transmitted by a sensor were received by one or more wireless receivers in the vicinity of the sensor and transferred through the LAN to a personal computer that was also connected, by wired means, to the LAN. This computer was located at the nursing station. Web-based application software designed for use with the wireless system and installed on the computer was used to configure the computer to receive, store, and display the temperature and RFID data.

This thermometer is designed for use at the axilla and uses a thermistor as the sensing element. It has two modes of operation: the predictive measurement mode and the direct measurement mode. In the predictive mode, the microprocessor in the thermometer analyzes the rising curve of the temperature detected by the sensor and predicts the body temperature after about 90 seconds, giving a beep upon completion of the measurement. If the thermometer remains in the axilla after this beep, it will switch to the direct mode, in which the thermometer will measure the temperature directly like a standard mercury thermometer and give the temperature reading along with a second beep after about 10 minutes from the start of measurement. The following specifications were obtained from the manufacturer and the instructions for use: measurement range, 32\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C; operating ambient temperature range, 10\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C; accuracy, \u00b10.2\u00b0C (95% confidence interval) for predictive mode, \u00b10.1\u00b0C for direct mode, both with respect to a standard mercury thermometer; display resolution, 0.1\u00b0C; measurement time, about 90 seconds in predictive measurement mode, about 10 minutes in direct measurement mode; power source, 3-V lithium coin-cell battery; battery life, approximately 10,000 measurements; dimensions, 126 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 10 mm; weight, 10 g with battery; applicable accuracy standard, EN 12470-3.",

Agreement between the paired readings was assessed using mean difference statistics (Bland and Altman, 1986, Bland and Altman, 1995) and a nonparametric method that uses the percentages of differences within certain limits (O'Brien et al., 1993, O'Brien et al., 2002). The range, mean, standard deviation, p value (two-tailed), and distribution of differences for these three groups of data were then determined. In this analysis, the repeated measurements for each subject were treated as independent measurements. Although this might underestimate the true standard deviations of the differences, the effect was expected to be clinically insignificant because the number of repeated measurements (maximum of two) was considerably lower than the number of subjects (Bland & Altman, 2007). To assess the validity of this approach, the standard deviations of differences were also computed using a modified Bland\u2013Altman method that takes into account repeated measurements (Bland & Altman, 2007, \u201cMethod where the true value varies\u201d section, pp. 575\u2013578). Bland\u2013Altman plots were used to graphically illustrate agreement between the paired readings for the main groups. In addition, a post hoc statistical power analysis based on the computed mean difference statistics for the main groups of readings was performed to assess the adequacy of the sample sizes.",

First, the first measurement was taken just before a shift change and the second measurement just after. Second, the second measurement was taken shortly after the first for verification purposes. For one patient, the interval between the second and third measurements was 5 hours. A total of 271 TT readings were used for analysis.

Because of this, the range of normal temperatures and that for fever thresholds must depend on the same. The definition of fever appears to be arbitrary, depending on the clinical setting and patient condition (American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies Committee, & American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies Subcommittee on Pediatric Fever, 2003, Chamberlain and Terndrup, 1994, Chamberlain et al., 1995, Hughes et al., 2002, Kaul et al., 2006, O'Grady et al., 2008, Ryan and Levy, 2003). The American College of Emergency Physicians (2003) defines fever as a rectal temperature higher than 38\u00b0C for children aged 1 day to 3 years presenting to the emergency department. The American College of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America suggested that a core temperature of 38.3\u00b0C or higher should be considered a fever (O'Grady et al., 2008) but noted at the same time that a variety of arbitrary definitions are acceptable, depending on the desired level of sensitivity in fever detection. The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines fever for neutropenic patients with cancer as a single oral temperature of 38.3\u00b0C or higher or a temperature 38\u00b0C or higher for 1 hour or longer (Hughes et al., 2002). At KK Women's and Children's Hospital, the fever threshold is 37.8\u00b0C for ET and 37.5\u00b0C for AT. Comprehensive ranges for normal body temperatures by site have been established (Chamberlain and Terndrup, 1994, Chamberlain et al., 1995): axillary, 34.7\u00b0C to 37.3\u00b0C; oral, 35.5\u00b0C to 37.5\u00b0C; rectal, 36.6\u00b0C to 38.0\u00b0C; ear, 35.8\u00b0C to 38.0\u00b0C. Although the average ThermoSENSOR readings in this study lie between the corresponding average ear and axillary readings (Table 2), separate studies using a wider range of subjects and temperatures are required to establish the range of normal temperatures based on the sensor.",

This suggestion is also evident in the increasingly negative mean differences at higher reference temperatures (Table 2). However, this relationship is not conclusive because the correlation coefficients for the regression lines were rather low (0.309 for TT\u2013ET readings and 0.218 for TT\u2013AT readings). Further studies using more data in the higher and lower temperature ranges are required to characterize the relationship between difference and magnitude. For the TT\u2013AT readings (Figure 5), the gentle slope (+0.032\u00b0C/\u00b0C) and low correlation (0.047) suggest that the ET\u2013AT difference might be independent of magnitude, but this relationship needs to be confirmed by further studies.",

For the outlier (low AT reading) for Patient 26 (Figure 5), we suspect that the Terumo thermometer might not have been properly placed in the axilla.

As with most thermometers, ambient temperature can affect temperature measurement. We have, however, observed from laboratory tests that the sensor will give stable readings as long as it is properly attached to the skin, it is given sufficient time to warm up, and both the sensor and its surrounding region are not subjected to any localized heat or cold. When the ThermoSENSOR disc is in close contact with the skin, its sensing element, being at the center of the disc (Figure 1), is not directly exposed to ambient temperature but lies at the center of a relatively large region that is exposed to skin temperature. We believe this design helps to minimize the effect of ambient temperature. We recommend using the ThermoSENSOR within the specified ambient temperature range of 10\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C, which is easily met in a hospital environment. Although we have not specifically tested the effect of clothing covering the sensor on the accuracy of TT readings, we anticipate that any effect will be minimal. Further studies are, however, needed to characterize the effects of ambient temperature on ThermoSENSOR readings.",

First, the protocol can be modified to allow for simultaneous or almost simultaneous measurement of all the temperatures, so as to minimize the effect of physiological variations. Because the ear thermometer takes only 3 to 7 seconds to complete a measurement whereas the axillary thermometer requires a much longer time of about 90 seconds, the AT could be taken first followed by the ET, and the time of completion of the AT measurement could be recorded and used later to identify the next ThermoSENSOR reading that is closest in time to this recorded time. We recognize that this revised procedure may not work out if the child refuses to have the ET taken immediately after the AT is taken, in which case the axillary measurement may have to be repeated. Second, the study can be improved by exercising better coordination to reduce the number of cases in which the sensor is not given sufficient time to warm up to body temperature, is inadvertently not attached to the patient, or is already removed before reference temperatures are taken (Table 3). Third, the study can be extended by evaluating the thermometer against other temperatures such as oral and rectal temperatures. Last but not least, the base of test subjects should be expanded to include more temperatures in the lower and higher ranges to better assess the ability of the ThermoSENSOR to measure a wide range of temperatures (Table 1). In addition, standardized protocols for evaluating clinical thermometers should be developed that stipulate, among other things, a minimum sample size based on sound statistical considerations, age groups, temperature ranges, the minimum percentage of readings in each range, the method of analysis, and accuracy criteria for clinical use. One such protocol is being developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as part of a comprehensive standard on the performance of clinical thermometers (ISO, 2008). Standardized protocols, which have long been used for evaluation of blood pressure monitors (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), 2003, European Committee for Standardization (CEN), 2004, O'Brien et al., 1993, O'Brien et al., 2002), not only help ensure that devices meet minimum performance standards but also facilitate comparison of one device with another.",

First, for babies aged between 6 months and 1 year, we found the sensor somewhat bulky because it covered a relatively large area of their small abdomen. This problem can be mitigated by using a sensor that is smaller and thinner. Second, for these babies, we also found that wet diapers tended to loosen the adhesive film dressing. This problem can perhaps be mitigated by using an adhesive dressing that provides stronger adhesion to the skin or by changing the adhesive dressing periodically. Third, we encountered toddlers who simply refused to have a foreign object pasted on their body. We anticipate that this kind of refusal is likely to happen in practice, especially for young children, but think that a smaller and thinner sensor that is also easier to attach to the skin may make it easier for a child to agree to using it. The manufacturer has been requested to consider such a design for young children.",

Studies have shown that skin temperature itself in general neither reflects nor correlates with body temperature (Thomas, 2003, Thomas et al., 2004). Theoretically, any of several noninvasive methods of measuring body temperature could be used for wireless temperature monitoring, including the regular infrared ear thermometry (Chamberlain and Terndrup, 1994, Chamberlain et al., 1995), infrared ear thermometry using the arterial heat balance method (Loveys et al., 1999, Powell et al., 2001), infrared skin-contact thermometry at the temporal artery using the arterial heat balance method (Hebbar et al., 2005, Kistemaker et al., 2006, Kimberger et al., 2007, Roy et al., 2003), other types of skin-contact thermometry (Thomas, 2003, Thomas et al., 2004), and non-skin-contact infrared thermometry (De Curtis et al., 2008, Osio and Carnelli, 2007). However, skin-based thermometry appears to be more suited for wireless monitoring because the human body has a large skin surface, and more options are available for selecting an area that would make the sensor easier to install, less obtrusive, and more aesthetically appealing.",

The ThermoSENSOR, when used with the associated application software, enables nurses and clinicians to view patients' readings and receive alerts for abnormal readings not only from computers at nursing stations but also from portable wireless devices that are connected to the hospital's LAN, as well as from mobile telecommunication devices if the server is configured to communicate with such devices (Figure 2). Because of its use of RFID technology, the ThermoSENSOR also functions as a location sensor, which can be used for contact tracing during outbreaks of contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza (Eames and Keeling, 2003, Klinkenberg et al., 2006). In addition, the ThermoSENSOR can potentially be used in nonclinical settings that require a person's temperature and location to be tracked in an ambulatory manner, such as at home, in a nursing home, or in the workplace.",

            "text": "Notwithstanding its advantages, wireless physiological monitoring requires several technical considerations. First, wireless devices are subject to loss of signals caused by distance and physical obstructions between the sensor and the receiver (Molisch, 2005). In this study, the sensor was transmitting a reading every 30 seconds on average, so the first TT reading after the recorded measurement start time should have always occurred within the first minute. As the results show (Results section and Table 3), this did not always happen. This signal reception problem can be mitigated by installing more receivers distributed in the vicinity of the patients. Second, wireless devices are also subject to loss of signals caused by electromagnetic interference from electromagnetic signals emitted by other devices in the neighborhood if the emitted signals include the radio frequencies used by the wireless devices (Ashar and Ferriter, 2007, Bit-Babik et al., 2007). Last but not least, signals emitted by wireless devices can potentially interfere with the normal functions of other devices in the neighborhood if these other devices share the same frequencies as those of the wireless devices (Bit-Babik et al., 2007, van der Togt et al., 2008). For this reason, the ThermoSENSOR is not recommended for use on patients with an implanted cardiac device such as a pacemaker or an internal cardioverter-defibrillator (Dyrda and Khairy, 2008, Sweesy et al., 2004, Yerra and Reddy, 2007). Because of all these technical characteristics, installation of the ThermoSENSOR system or any other wireless physiological monitoring system in any location must take into consideration the physical structures of the location and the electromagnetic compatibility characteristics of other devices\u2014wireless and nonwireless\u2014that are used or will be used in and around the location. With proper site survey, planning, and system design and installation, the undesirable effects of these technical characteristics can be mitigated, and the benefits of a wireless monitoring system will outweigh the costs of setting up and running the system.",
