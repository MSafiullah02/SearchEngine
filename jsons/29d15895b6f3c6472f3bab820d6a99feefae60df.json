These infection control interventions include early identification of cases and their contacts, avoiding close contact with people with airway symptoms, appropriate hand washing, and enhanced standard infection prevention, and control practices in the healthcare setting. 47, 48 Uncertain issues Although information on COVID-19 has increased rapidly since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, many issues remain unresolved. First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier state to severe pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality rate was high. 12e14 Subsequent to the publication of the studies of patients with only ARD or mild pneumonia, we found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased, children or neonates could contract COVID-19, and the mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports. 8, 11 However, whether children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear. 49 In addition, most studies, especially those with a large patient population, were conducted in China, and the study of asymptomatic carriers was limited. More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Second, Zou et al. reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients; however, the viral loads from patients with severe diseases were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate presentations. Moreover, higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat. 50 As there is a concern of virus spread due to severe cough induced by performing a throat swab, nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of patients with COVID-19. However, this study involved a population of only 18 patients, including one asymptomatic patient. 49 In addition, every test has its own limitation and sensitivity/specificity; however, the studies investigating the performance of current diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2 among different COVID-19 populations, including asymptomatic carriers, ARD, and pneumonia, are lacking. The false positive and negative rates of each diagnostic tool among patients with COVID-19 presenting varying degrees of severity of the disease remain unknown. This type of information is important for screening patients with COVID-19 and to aid isolation and infection control strategies. Finally, since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the asymptomatic individual, the prophylactic or pre-emptive use of effective anti-viral agents to reduce the viral load and decrease the risk of virus spread from asymptomatic carriers may help to control the spread of COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 515, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 516, "end": 518, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1262, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1265, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1418, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2082, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2404, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Image"}, {"text": "This review provides updated information about COVID-19.
