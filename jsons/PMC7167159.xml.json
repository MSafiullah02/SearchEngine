            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease that began in Guandong, China in November 2002, and has caused serious infection in Asia, Europe and Canada.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The SARS coronavirus (CoV), which is a pathogenic virus of SARS, is a single\u2010strand RNA virus. It is known that this virus infects animals other than humans.6, 7, 8 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mortality for patients afflicted with SARS is about 15% on average, and can be 50% or higher in the case of patients aged 65 and over.9 SARS\u2010CoV is an enveloped and positively single\u2010stranded RNA virus with a typical genome size 29.7 kb, encoding a RNA directed RNA polymerase and structural proteins including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.10, 11, 12 The N protein is a 422\u2010amino\u2010acid alkaline protein with a short lysine\u2010rich region suggested to be the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA.13 The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases.14 Since SARS broke out in 2003, researchers have made great efforts in the development of fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis.15, 16, 17, 18, 19\n",

Therefore, SARS\u2010CoV N protein has long been thought an ideal target for the detection of SARS. The monitoring of SARS\u2010CoV N protein has been of considerable interest in the development of simple and reliable methods for the detection of SARS for applications in diagnostic medicine. At present, the most widely used method of diagnosing SARS is the detection of anti\u2010SARS antibodies using a screening enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on recombinant proteins from the genome of SARS.18, 19 Although it is highly specific, this assay has limitations. For example, it cannot detect viruses during the early stage of an infection, at a time when antibodies against SARS antigens are not produced. In addition, the ELISA method sometimes generates false\u2010positive or false\u2010negative results. In addition, using antibodies creates problem such as being temperature\u2010sensitive, specific reactions conditions and requiring secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme and fluorescent dyes.",

Preferential binding of QDs\u2010conjugated RNA aptamer for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV N protein was determined by analyzing the fluorescence intensity measured by confocal microscopy. As illustrated in Fig. 4(B), the QDs\u2010supported RNA aptamer conjugates showed high fluorescence signals on the chip. No fluorescence signal was detected with BSA protein, due to its lack of affinity (Fig. 4(A)). The signal of QDs\u2010conjugated RNA oligonucleotide for BSA protein binding affinity was very similar to the background signal. Figure 4(C) and 4(D) shows that QDs\u2010conjugated RNA aptamer is selective against SARS\u2010CoV N protein due to protein concentrations. The binding affinity was examined by confocal assay with varying concentrations of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein. It was observed that the signal intensity of the QDs\u2010conjugated RNA aptamer could be detected even at the lowest concentration (0.1 pg mL\u22121).
