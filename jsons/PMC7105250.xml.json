            "text": "One of the purposes of proteomics is to identify unknown biologically active proteins and use this information to develop novel drugs. Some active proteins occur at very low levels in the human body and thus have to be produced by biotechnology. Escherichia coli is one of the mostly used host cell in biotechnology. But when proteins are expressed in E. coli, they often form inactive protein aggregates called inclusion bodies. A step necessary in recovering active proteins from E. coli is protein refolding (it is simply called protein folding here) or protein renaturation; it is usually the key step during the production of therapeutic proteins by biotechnology, especially at the industrial scale. The yields from refolding by traditional methods are usually very low, typically 5\u201320%. Application of liquid chromatography (LC) to protein folding is one of the most interesting and exciting methods to develop in recent years. When it is used in protein folding, the bioactivity recovery increases, the folded protein can be easily separated from misfolded forms, protein concentration after refolding is relatively high, and it is easy to scale up and automate, therefore it is regarded as an efficient, and close to ideal refolding method [1], [2]. Additionally, it has the potential to be used at an industrial or large scale, today it has become a very popular technique for protein folding.",

Therefore, the target protein must be further processed using coarse fractionation and fine fractionation. In addition, using the usual dialysis method for protein folding, it typically takes 24 h to refold a protein, with numerous changes of buffer during dialysis. This method can remove most of the denaturants, but cannot completely remove them, and cannot separate the target protein from contaminant proteins.",

They reported that denatured proteins have a much larger Stokes radius than denaturants, so the former move much faster than the latter and result in a gradual decrease in denaturant concentration around denatured protein molecules, causing protein folding step by step, and as this happens their Stokes radius decreases gradually. When protein folding is accomplished, their Stokes radius is constant, and the protein is eluted out in its native state. They thought that their dispersion rate decreased when the denatured protein molecules entered gels, which reduced aggregation. They further tested the above mechanism using high performance SEC [9].",

In regular LC, only adsorption (P\n(N,mo,a)) and desorption (P\n(N,mo,d)) of the native protein in a monomeric state with the stationary phase involving the usual LC and any separation depends on the partition coefficient of proteins between these two phases, while protein folding in the usual buffer is mainly controlled by the primary structure of the protein. During protein folding in buffer, on the one hand, a series of aggregation processes, such as unfolding of the monomer, P\n(U,mo,d) to dimer, trimer, multimer, until protein precipitates may form, being unfavorable protein folding. On the other hand, the denatured state P\n(U,mo,d), can also be converted to its native state, P\n(N,mo,d) under a suitable conditions, being favorable protein folding. However, with PFLC, the stationary phase (see Section 2.2.2) makes chemical equilibrium move from precipitate and/or its polymers to its monomer in the unfolded state, P\n(U,mo,d) to fold to its monomeric native state, P\n(N,mo,d), until finally it elutes out of the column.",

            "text": "The mechanism of protein folding by HIC was presented in 1992 [10] and reported in detail in 2002 [3], [11], [12]. The unfolded protein molecules are pushed by hydrophobic interaction forces from the mobile phase at a high salt concentration to move forward to stationary phase of HIC (STHIC) and tightly contact the STHIC with apolar region of amino acid sequence residues to form a stable complex and the hydrophilic parts of the unfolded protein molecules face to the mobile phase. Thus, the unfolded protein molecules cannot aggregate in this circumstance. The unfolded protein molecules take enough energy at the molecule level from the STHIC and simultaneously carry out three functions: (i) The STHIC can recognize a specific hydrophobic region of a polypeptide. (ii) Squeezing out water molecules in a hydrated state from both the hydrated unfolded protein and the STHIC. (iii) The microdomains of the protein molecules on the STHIC are formed. The unfolded protein molecules desorb from the STHIC as the salt concentration decreases, or as the water concentration in the mobile phase increases. Protein molecules with incorrect microdomains would be corrected by the microdomains spontaneously disappearing in the mobile phase due to their unstable thermodynamics. After many rounds of adsorption and desorption of the protein during gradient elution, the incorrect microdomains would decrease, while the protein molecules with correct microdomains would increase, resulting in the protein attaining complete refolding. The complete refolded protein can be separated from its stable intermediates, or its incompletely refolded forms. Several unfolded proteins can be simultaneously refolded and, at the same time, separated from each other.",

            "text": "SEC is most often applied to PFLC due to its ease of operation, easy scale up and suitability to the refolding of a wide range of proteins. In 1992, one of the authors [10] used SEC to refold three kinds of standard proteins. In 1994, Werner et al. [13] prepared recombinant human ETS-1, bovine ribonuclease A and integration host factor (IHF), and increase the capacity of the technique to the mg scale. In 1996, Batas and Chaudhuri [8] used Sephacryl S 100 as SEC gel, and refolded hen egg white lysozyme and bovine carbonate anhydrase (CAB) at an initial protein concentration of 80 mg/mL, their bioactivity recovery was 63% (a specific bioactivity recovery of 104%) and 56% (a specific bioactivity recovery of 81%), respectively, they investigated the SEC refolding method in detail. In order to provide a wild environment for protein folding, Gu et al. [14] reported urea gradient SEC, in which a gradually decreasing gradient of urea concentration from top to bottom was initially formed in the SEC column, denaturants were removed linearly by this method and good results were obtained for denatured proteins with a high protein concentration. For denatured/reduced lysozyme at an initial concentration of 17 mg/mL, a bioactivity recovery as high as 90% could be obtained in 40 min. In addition, they developed a SEC refolding method with dual gradients of pH and urea concentration, the results were relatively good. Dong et al. [15] combined SEC and the artificial molecular chaperone, they used cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a detergent and \u03b2-cyclodextrin as a stripping agent (i.e., eluent), denatured/reduced lysozyme with an initial concentration of 80 mg/mL was refolded using this method. The results showed that this method is favorable for protein folding under conditions of high flow rate of the mobile phase. Chaperone solvent plug SEC proposed by Liu and Chang [16] could obviously reduce precipitates formed before denatured protein entered the top of the column, and relatively high mass recovery was obtained. Schlegl et al. [17] reported a continuous matrix assisted protein folding system based on SEC refolding and continuous annular chromatography (CAC), it forces denatured proteins to refold to their native states quantitatively and continuously. Recently, simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB) in SEC mode was also used to refold proteins [18], [19], this gave new inspiration to the development of SEC. Table 1\nshows some examples of protein folding by SEC.",

In 1997, HIC was applied to the refolding and purification of several HIV protease mutants by Du-Pout-Merck Co. [31], [32]. So far, many proteins, such as recombinant human interferon-\u03b3 (rhIFN-\u03b3) [10], [33], [34], [35], bovine insulin [36], lysozyme [37], recombinant bovine prion protein [38] were successfully refolded using HIC, and good results were obtained. Additionally, in 2004 and 2006, the refolding with simultaneous purification of rhIFN-\u03b3 [34] and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) [39] were reported, respectively, downstream processes for their production in biotechnology were simplified greatly. Li et al. [40], [41] refolded the originally denatured lysozyme and recombinant staphylococcus aureus elongation factor G (EF-G) separately using HIC with several urea gradients. Recently, they refolded consensus interferon (C-IFN) using HIC with a dual-gradient of decreasing guanidine hydrochloride concentration and increasing PEG concentration [42]. Compared with dilution refolding, the gradient HIC process, in the presence of PEG, gave about 2.6-folds of increase in specific activity, 30% increase in soluble protein recovery. Urea denatured recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF) produced by E. coli were renatured with simultaneous purification using a high performancehydrophobic interaction chromatographic (HPHIC) column packed with packing materials with an end group of PEG400 [48]. The refolded rhSCF had a good bioactivity and a high purity. Table 2\nshows some examples of protein folding by HIC.",

            "text": "Protein folding by IEC was introduced by Creighton [49], [50] in 1986, he used a refolding system consisting of three buffers, in which a decreasing gradient of urea concentration was used to refold protein, then an increasing gradient of salt concentration was performed to elute the refolded protein. Suttnar et al. [51] used 0.01 mol/L NaOH solution to solubilize the inclusion body of papilloma virus HPV16 E7MS2 fusion protein, and successfully refolded the solubilized target protein using Mono Q strong anion exchange chromatographic column. Stempfer et al. [52] fused a polycation tag containing hexa-arginine onto \u03b1-glucosidase, and refolded this fusion protein by IEC with a polyanionic support. This method provides a novel protocol for proteins with very few charges, but the fusion and cleavage of the tag was relatively complex. Kweon et al. [53] refolded cyclodextrin glycocyltransferase fused with 10 lysine residues at the C-terminus (CGTK10ase) using strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) with SP Sepharose gel, the refolded yield was approximately 100% and the protein concentration after elution was 2.5 mg/mL, the initial protein concentration was 7.5 mg/mL. This method is similar to that introduced by Stempfer et al. [52]. Li et al. [54] improved the refolded yield of lysozyme using urea and pH dual gradient SCX with soft gel SP Sepharose. In 2002, Cho [55] used Expanded bed adsorption chromatography (EBA) packed with a weak anion exchange resin to refold proteins, it simplified the production procedure for proteins in inclusion bodies. In 2005, Machold et al. [56] used preparative continuous annular chromatographic (P-CAC) packed with DEAE Sepharose to refold \u03b1-lactalbumin continuously. Liu et al. [57] recently proposed a relatively versatile refolding method using IEC with a silica-based weak cation exchanger, very high mass and bioactivity recoveries were obtained for denatured lysozyme. In this method, 4.0 mol/L urea was a constituent of the equilibration and elution buffers, and ammonium sulfate which is good for maintaining the stability of native proteins was selected as the elution agent. A similar method was also applied to rhG-CSF [58], [59]. Lu et al. [60] refolded recombinant dual human stem cell factor using IEC similar to Creighton's method, the target protein obtained had a purity of 90%, and a refolded yield of 19.46%. Denatured/reduced bovine serum albumin (BSA) which contains 17 pairs of disulfide bonds was renatured using strong anion exchange chromatography (SAX) with a Q Sepharose column [61]. BSA was eluted after an incubation of 40 h in the SAX column, its refolded yield and mass recovery were 55 and 67%, respectively, this is one of the most complex proteins refolded by LC. Examples for protein folding by IEC are listed in Table 3\n.",

AFC applied to protein folding can be classified into three types according to their ligands: immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), immobilized liposome chromatography (ILC), and immobilized molecular chaperone chromatography (IMCC). In 1994, Phadtare et al. [69] immobilized the molecular chaperone GroEL on the surface of a stationary phase and used this column on tublin and glutamine synthetase. In 1997, Altamirano et al. [70] immobilized histidine-fused GroEL (191\u2013345) with 17 amino acid residues at the N-terminus on Ni-NTA resin through a chelating interaction, and used the column packed with this modified resin to refold indole 3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) mutants IGPS (49\u2013252) denatured by 8 mol/L urea, its mass recovery was 92%, and the refolded protein had a bioactivity of 100%. They also used this affinity column to refold cyclophilin A, its mass recovery was 84% and its bioactivity recovery was 98%. In 1999, they immobilized molecular chaperone/disulfide isomerase/proline PPI on agrose resin and formed a tri-component stationary phase, they used this column to refold scorpion toxin Cn5 [71], which could not be refolded at all using other methods. Its mass recovery was 87% and its bioactivity recovery was near 100%, and thus they called this method as refolding chromatography. They also used this method to refold another recombinant protein [72]. Gao et al. [73] refolded rhIFN-\u03b3 using an immobilized molecular chaperone fragment. Guan et al. [74] immobilized mini-molecular chaperone sht GroEL (191\u2013345) on activated Sepharose Fast Flow gel and used a column packed with this modified gel to refold rhIFN-\u03b3, the results showed that this method was very useful for the refolding of rhIFN-\u03b3. When 100 \u03bcL of rhIFN-\u03b3 solution with a protein concentration of 17.8 mg/mL was injected into the column, the mass recovery of the target protein was 74.25% and its bioactivity was 6.74 \u00d7 106\n IU/mL.",

For the refolding of Ykt6p SNARE by IMAC, its mass recovery was 88%, and its purity was 94% [78]. Aequorin was adsorbed onto Ni-NTA agarose in batch mode, after that the agarose beads were packed into column, then the adsorbed aequorin was refolded by IMAC [75], crowding of denatured proteins on the top of the column was avoided in this manner, and aggregates decreased. Tien and co-workers [79] used the octapeptide repeated sequence in recombinant bovine prion as a natural affinity tag, and refolded the protein by Ni-NTA IMAC and the target protein with correct structure was obtained, its mass recovery was 11%. Wild rhG-CSF without any affinity tag was also refolded successfully using IMAC [80].",

When aggregates formed, the back pressure of the column would increase significantly, even blocking the column. Additionally, mass and bioactivity recoveries of the target protein would decrease. This problem is more important in large scale PFLC. Geng and co-workers [92], [93] designed and manufactured in a series of units for simultaneous renaturation and purification of proteins (USRPP), also called chromatographic cake, its length is very short, only 1.0\u20135.0 cm, but its diameter is up from 2.0 to 50 cm or even larger. Its cross section is very large, so the increase in the column back pressure is not obvious when a few precipitates accumulate on the filter or on the top of column bed. This unit has very good resolution for proteins in laboratory (Fig. 2a) and large scales (Fig. 2b), it has been applied to the refolding of many proteins, and was used for the refolding with simultaneous purification of rhIFN-\u03b3 [34] and rhG-CSF [39] at an industrial scale. When the USRPP with a size of 10 mm \u00d7 200 mm i.d. was used, rhIFN-\u03b3 with a purity of more than 95%, and a specific bioactivity of 8.9 \u00d7 107\n IU/mg can be obtained by using USRPP within 2 h, bioactivity recovery can reach 24-fold that of traditional methods, the time it takes was only half that of the traditional method. When using the USRPP with a dimension of 10 mm \u00d7 300 mm i.d., 700 mL of rhIFN-\u03b3 solution extracted by 7.0 mol/L GuHCl containing 2.0 g of total protein could be processed in one run with a flow rate of 120 mL/min [34]. And the USRPP was also used to refold rhG-CSF with simultaneous purification at large scales [39].",

Based on the fact that the retention of biopolymers in LC is dominated by the contact surface area between biopolymers and the stationary phase employed [7], [94], [95], [96], a short column packing with small particles (i.e., less than 10 \u03bcm) should theoretically have an identical resolution to that of a longer column packed with the same kind packing with large diameter particles (i.e., 50\u2013100 \u03bcm), but the latter is much cheaper than the former. Thus, a series of simple and cheap columns were manufactured [3], [39], [97], in which large particulates were packed and the HPHIC column packing materials are silica-based, it is much cheaper than the USRPP. Compared to Fig. 2a, although it still has a good resolution for protein (Fig. 3\n), its resolution is a little worse. It can be used either for investigating chromatographic conditions in laboratory scale, or as a pre-column for other uses.",

It can allow sampling and separation to be performed continuously, and it is a very important preparative chromatographic technique. Schlegl et al. [17] reported a continuous matrix assisted protein folding system based on SEC refolding and continuous annular chromatography (CAC). This system consisted of a preparative CAC and an ultrafiltration system, the CAC was used for protein folding and separation, the ultrafiltration was used to recover protein aggregates formed during protein folding, and then the recovered aggregates were re-injected into the CAC for refolding again. This system can help make denatured proteins be refolded into their native states quantitatively and continuously. When using Superdex 75 PrepGrade as a gel to refold bovine \u03b1-lactoalbumin, a refolded yield of only 30% was obtained by using the normal batch SEC, but the refolded yield was increased to 41% by using the continuous system when the recycle rate was 65%. If the aggregates could be quantitatively solubilized and recycled to the sample solution, the refolded yield might have a potential to achieve nearly 100%. Lanckriet and Middelberg [100] also refolded lysozyme by using CAC. Machold et al. [56] refolded \u03b1-lactoalbumin in continuous operation mode using a preparative continuous annular chromatographic (P-CAC) column packed with DEAE Sepharose resin. A solution containing 2 mol/L GuHCl was used to dissolve protein aggregates and precipitates in the column during refolding. The re-dissolved proteins were recovered by ultrafiltration and were re-injected into the chromatographic system for refolding again; the refolded yield was enhanced to a certain extent. Continuous operation of protein refolding by IEC was achieved in this method, and it represents a very good idea for recovery of protein precipitates during PFLC. However, P-CAC is not stable, especially its flow rate is unstable, its peak wiggle, and it is not easy to operate.",

It has some advantages such as high reproducibility, low solvent cost, low product dilution ratio, therefore, its operational cost is relatively low, but its one-off investment is relatively high. For separation at preparative and productive scales, low operational cost is in the highest flight compared to high one-off investment, therefore, the separation cost of SMB is lower than batch chromatography [101]. This technique has been used for large scale separation in many fields. Park et al. [18], [19] used four-zone SMB in SEC mode to refold denatured/reduced lysozyme continuously, both its bioactivity and mass recoveries were more than 90%. During the process, the productivity was high, cost of refolding buffer was low and support use rate was high. Compared to batch SEC, the concentration of lysozyme obtained by SMB was high, and the cost of adsorbents was low.",

Urea is the mostly commonly used denaturant added to mobile phases. Muller and Rinase [22] refolded platelet-derived growth factor by using SEC, it was found that aggregates increased from 10 to 60% when the mobile phase changed from 0.5 mol/L GuHCl to 0.5 mol/L NaCl. Liu et al. [57] found that bioactivity recovery increased and then decreased with increasing urea concentrations during the refolding of lysozyme by high performance weak cation exchange chromatography (HPWCX), with the highest recovery at 4.0 mol/L urea. Little bioactivity recovery was obtained when the urea concentration was less than 1.0 mol/L. Similar results were obtained for the refolding with simultaneous purification of rhG-CSF using SAX with Q Sepharose FF gel, but the most suitable urea concentration is 3.0 mol/L [58], [59]. It can be seen that urea concentration is very critical for the PFLC, especially for those proteins susceptible to aggregation, but different urea concentrations are required for different proteins.",

Fahey et al. [25] found that the types of stationary phase had a significant effect on the refolding of urokinase plasminogen activator by SEC. It was thought that the fraction range of the stationary phase was responsible for the refolding results. Gu et al. [26] obtained results similar to those above. Wang et al. [38] refolded a recombinant bovine normal prion protein fragment [rbPrP (104\u2013242)] with simultaneous purification using a HPHIC with three different types of stationary phases (phenyl, PEG600 and tetrahydrogen furfural), the results indicated that the types of stationary phase had a significant effect on the mass recovery and purity. Denatured lysozyme was also refolded by HPHIC using the above three types of stationary phase [37], it was found that the highest refolded yield was obtained when PEG600, which has the weakest hydrophobicity, was used as the stationary phase. Geng et al. [34] found that types of stationary phase also had a very significant effect on the refolding of rhIFN-\u03b3, the best results were achieved when using PEG200 as the stationary phase, which has the weakest hydrophobicity among the seven investigated types of stationary phase. Results obtained by Li et al. [40] indicated that ligands with strong hydrophobicity were susceptible to causing misfolding of EF-G, thus resulting in irreversible adsorption and lower refolded yields. Machold et al. [66] found that various refolded yields were obtained with different anion exchangers for denatured \u03b1-lactoalbumin, and the refolding time was much different with these exchangers. It also indicated that refolded yields of lysozyme depended significantly on the types of stationary phase during its refolding using HPWCX [102]. Various proteins have various structures and characteristics, they require different stationary phases for their refolding, and therefore a suitable stationary phase should be selected from various stationary phases. Additionally, stationary phases with new structures and characteristics should be developed to broaden the types of stationary phases, thereby accelerating the maturation of the PFLC technique.",

It can also affect the rate of denatured protein molecules entering into the column and the rate of decreasing the denaturant concentration, thus resulting in different refolded yields. Harrowing and Chaudhuri [103] investigated the effect of flow rates on the refolded yields of \u03b2-lactamase by SEC, it was found that the mass recovery increased with increasing the flow rate. Fahey et al. [23] found the same phenomenon during the refolding of urokinase plasminogen activator using SEC. But Gu et al. [26] found that aggregates reduced and the bioactivity recovery increased with a decrease in flow rate. Guan et al. [74] refolded rhIFN-\u03b3 using gels immobilized with mini-molecular chaperone sht GroEL (191\u2013345), they found that both mass recovery and specific bioactivity increased with a decrease in the flow rate. Liu et al. [29] thought that it was the key for protein folding using SEC to reduce aggregates before denatured protein entered the column and to make protein stay for enough time in the column. They used higher flow rates during the process when the protein was moving from injection valve to the top of column, then lowering the flow rate to make the protein stay long enough in the column, the results demonstrated that the aggregates were reduced significantly and that the refolding results were very good. Liu [102] refolded lysozyme using HPWCX, they found that the bioactivity recovery increased somewhat with an increase in the flow rate, approaching the highest refolded yield at a flow rate of about 2.0 mL/min, but stayed static after that. Li et al. [54] found that bioactivity recovery increased initially and then decreased with an increase in the flow rate during the refolding of lysozyme using IEC. Geng et al. [34] found that the lower flow rate was favorable for improving mass of rhIFN-\u03b3 during its refolding using HPHIC. It can be seen that the effects of flow rate on the refolded yield is not consistent, this may have something to do with refolding methods, but it is affirmative that flow rate has an important effect on PFLC.",

A suitable concentration of glycerol could also benefit the refolding of rhG-CSF using IMAC or SEC [30], [80].

            "text": "Similar to protein folding by dilution method, the injected total mass of unfolded protein can also affect protein folding. It was found that the refolded yields decreased by increasing the initial protein concentration during the refolding of carbonate anhydrase and urokinase plasminogen activator by using SEC [23], [26]. Guan et al. [74] obtained a similar result during the refolding of rhIFN-\u03b3 by using AFC. Li et al. [54] found that the bioactivity recovery decreased by increasing the injection mass during the refolding of lysozyme using IEC, the bioactivity recovery decreased from 100 to 62% as injected mass increased from 2 to 30 mg. Liu et al. [57] found that the bioactivity recovery increased gradually by increasing the initial protein concentration when the initial protein concentration was relatively low, but decreased by further increasing the initial protein concentration, this is consistent with the results obtained by Stempfer et al. [52]. Langenhof et al. [61] found that both refolded yield and mass recovery decreased by increasing the injection mass during the refolding of BSA using IEC. This is because the higher injected mass of protein would affect the adsorption of the denatured protein molecules by the stationary phase, thus resulting in increasing aggregation of the partially refolded protein molecules. Partial refolded intermediates also form at higher local protein concentration during elution process. But protein concentrations after elution and production efficiency would improve as injected protein mass increased; however, protein purity would decrease to a certain extent. Therefore, several factors, such as refolded yield, production efficiency and protein purity must be considered together when investigating injection mass.",

            "text": "PFLC is a newly developed method which enables many biochemical and physicochemical processes, and performs protein folding which was originally in normal buffer by liquid chromatography. It has many advantages compared with other methods for protein folding, but it is not as simple to operate as LC. Actually, many technical difficulties and theoretical problems must be overcome. Although the presence of the stationary phase in an LC system brings many advantages for protein folding, because the mechanism of protein folding carried out in the usual buffer has not been fully understood yet, much more complicated theoretical problems stemming from PFLC are required to be solved. Thus, PFLC is only at the starting point of its development cycle. However, because it has so many advantages, such as easy operation, high automatization, easy scale up, refolding of proteins at higher concentrations and also purifies target proteins simultaneously during protein folding, scientists may be encouraged to pay more attention to develop new theories and explore new technologies to facilitate this method. Thus, it can be expected that PFLC will have a very bright future. However, a lot of difficult problems are encountered during the folding of a denatured/reduced protein. It involves both thermodynamic problem (correct forming of many disulfide bonds existed in a protein molecule) and kinetic problem (rapid forming of disulfide bonds). An approach is to synthesize new chromatographic packing materials with good properties (having good capability of refolding and separating proteins) and low costs, such as to prepare stationary phases binding to a pair oxidized/reduced agents, such as glutathione in oxidation form (GSSG) and its reduced form (GSH) to make the forming of disulfide bonds during chromatographic process. Because ligands of many kinds of LC including HIC, IEC, AFC, have hydrophobic region, the presence of hydrophobic region of an amino acid sequence can help to form a correct microdomain, resulting in each thiol, or at least most of thiols approaching a right place for subsequential thiol pairing. If a suitable catalyst can be found to accelerate the oxidation of each thiol, whole refolding of the protein can be accomplished during the process of elution. If several thiols existed in a denatured/reduced protein, some of these thiols could be rapidly oxidized to form correct disulfide bonds on a column, because a corrected domain has thermodynamically stable structure, the remaining thiols cannot freely move and can be permitted to stand enough time to continuously perform oxidation, or refolding for several hours, even overnight after being eluted out of column. An appropriate regenerization method for these types of stationary phase to make the GSSG column regeneration should be established. It is also important to find out fast and low-cost disulfide pairing methods for industrial production, to avoid use of expensive agents, such as glutathione, molecular chaperones, and enzymes for protein folding. To find out more effective ways to dissolve the deposit formed by aggregates/precipitates on the packing bed, resulting in recovering the target protein and regenerating chromatographic column. Further broadening the applications of PFLC to various standard proteins and recombinant proteins in inclusion bodies, especially those that have large molecular weight or more than four disulfide bonds, and to investigate factors effecting PFLC to provide more data for the optimization of protein folding, to thoroughly develop PFLC for the industrial scale, to investigate and to summarize rules for scaling-up PFLC; to design a new and cheap equipment and to facilitate PFLC, and to combine PFLC and other refolding methods such as artificial molecule chaperones to develop new PFLC methods. We do believe that PFLC has a bright future.",
