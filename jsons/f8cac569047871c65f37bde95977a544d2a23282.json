            "text": "Innovation in institutional mechanisms is a fundamental issue in effectively dealing with public health emergencies. In the wake of the 2003 SARS Epidemic, China initially established a public health emergency management system and an emergency organization and management network, placing emphasis on \"government leading, unified command, local management, responsibility on all levels, management by classifications, and inter-departmental coordination,\" which strengthened the existing health emergency preparation system. The state also implemented overall arrangements and various measures concerning health emergency management and these efforts boosted the country's capabilities in dealing with public health emergencies. Facing the global Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, China played to its socialist strengths by \"bringing together forces to accomplish big things\" and by establishing a joint prevention and control mechanism spearheaded by the government. Roles and responsibilities were defined, and collaboration and communication between departments were strengthened. This mechanism provided the Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control efforts with organizational guarantee, systematic support, and process specifications. Taking into consideration domestic realities and conditions, this chapter provides an analysis of the establishment and operation of Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control mechanisms, and of the social involvement of these mechanisms at national and local levels. Some reflections are presented based on experiences and lessons learned from this pandemic, in the hope of providing ideas for innovation in future emergency management institutional mechanisms.",

Some provincial emergency management offices insisted that for an emergency event like the ongoing Influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, a joint prevention and control office should be located in a specialized department so as to leverage the department's expertise and increase response flexibility, convenience and efficiency. In this scenario, the provincial emergency management office would be tasked with solving issues that the specialized department could not. On the other hand, some provincial health department's emergency offices argued that if the office was located in the local government, the joint prevention and control office would enjoy greater authority and more efficient collaboration.",

These departments and mechanisms should have been employed upon the onset of the Influenza A (H1N1) Epidemic. However, most provinces established completely new leading groups only after the central government established Joint National Prevention and Control Mechanism. In one example, a provincial health department already had a permanent public health emergency operations center, but, after the central government established the Influenza A (H1N1) Joint National Prevention and Control Mechanism, this province created an entirely new prevention and control leading group and a port leading group. At the same time, the Health Department also established new eternal mechanisms, including: the provincial CDC established an emergency response department with leaders from major sections like emergency management and vaccination planning (starting in 2005, this provincial CDC implemented a \"3 in 1\" meeting system with participation from emergency management, disease control, and the disease monitoring department).",

There was also a lack of coordination and standardization between central-level ministries' policy documents for Influenza A (H1N1) countermeasures. For example, in regards to content standardization, the health authorities felt that using the temperature of 37.3\u00b0C as the sole standard for sending people to the hospital was unreasonable and would cause an unnecessary burden on hospitals. In regards to time standardization, on December 2nd, 2009, one province stipulated that only patients with a temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher must be sent to a hospital, and it took the country two more weeks to follow suit. In regards to inter-departmental work, port laboratories in some provinces had begun testing in the early days of epidemic, but stopped after provincial health departments decided that ports were not fit for such work. Obstacles also arose in horizontal coordination and collaboration between local departments. A lack of information communication between local departments due to the unavailability of complete information in the early stages of prevention and control made it nearly impossible for effective collaboration.",

Some felt that the central government should not have made Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control an issue of political significance but should have been objective in understanding the differences between executive leadership and scientists' opinions. While the main duty of administrative leaders should have been to organize and mobilize social resources needed to cope with the epidemic, scientists should have been the ones to handle technical issues such as epidemic analysis and response measures. At the same time, more efficient communication should have been present between central and local departments tasked with specific operations. For example, some local management departments felt that the entire process was quite political, making some documents difficult to fully implement; in the two most volatile months that lasted from April 28th to June, documents were issued frequently, and in some cases were in conflict with one another and lacked integrity and continuity. In regards to adjustment of prevention and control strategies, some regions' health departments reported the following issues: higher-level departments frequently adjusted technical guidance and strategies for prevention and control, there was a wide variety of information reporting methods and they were constantly in flux, different departments formulated their own response requirements, and differences occurred in measures and standards; all of which greatly complicated local response operations.",

In January 2005, Premier Wen Jiabao chaired an Executive Meeting of the State Council where the National Overall Contingency Plan for National Contingency Plan for Nuclear and Radiation Accidents, and others. The State Council organized the drafting and revision of such health emergency response plans such as the National Contingency Plan for Medical and Health Rescue, the Contingency Plan for Community-level Public Health Emergencies, and the Contingency Plan for Food Poisoning Emergencies. Local governments and health departments also formulated health emergency response plans in accordance with their local conditions. In preparation for an influenza pandemic, the MOH formulated the Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan of the Ministry of Health (Tentative), which was issued on September 28th, 2005. On July 12th, 2006, the MOH issued the Emergency Response Plan for Highly Pathogenic Human and Avian Influenza, which, as a departmental contingency plan under the National Overall Contingency Plan for Public Health Emergencies, provided systematic organization and leadership against an influenza pandemic, and it outlined important factors for response efforts including division of labor, preparedness, emergency response, and supervision. 4.1.2.2 The Establishment of Public Health Emergency Management Bodies As arranged by the State Council, in March 2004 the MOH set up the Health Emergency Office (Public Health Emergency Operations Center) which became responsible for the organization and coordination for managing emergency preparations and countermeasures. The MOH Health Emergency Office (Public Health response training and exercises; keeping records and plans on the national stockpile and providing recommendations on their usage; managing the National Expert Advisory Committee on Public Health Emergencies as well as public health emergency experts; directing and organizing preparation and response measures against acute infectious diseases; organizing medical rescue efforts in case of serious natural disasters, terrorist incidents, food safety emergencies, and nuclear radiation accidents; organizing and coordinating health emergency response services for major national events; organizing health emergency research and health education programs; responsible for the organization and coordination of domestic implementation for the International Health Regulations; coordinating the implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention in the health industry; and carrying out routine work for the Office of the MOH Leading Group for Disaster Relief and Disease Prevention. At the same time, a health emergency management system was established, which included the following seven subsystems-Emergency Response Security, Command & Decision-making, Emergency Response Workforce, Monitoring & Alert, Emergency Response Management, Risk Communication, and Science, Technology & Education (Fig. 4.2).Currently, health departments (bureaus) in 30 provinces (autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government) have established health emergency response offices and the China CDC along with some provincial CDCs also have established special emergency management departments. For example, Beijing established a public health emergency operations center in March 2006, and Shanghai did as well in early 2009 to strengthen its capacity for pubic health emergency management.
