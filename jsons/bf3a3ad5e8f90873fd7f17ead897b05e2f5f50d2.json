            "text": "Viral enteritis in piglets is usually associated with Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus or with Porcine Rotavirus. In 1978, a new coronavirus-like agent was detected in the intestinal contents of piglets with diarrhoea (1 1). The agent was shown to differ antigenically from the porcine coronaviruses Transmissible Gastro-enteritis Virus and Haemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus. The clinical aspects of the disease and the virological aspects of the causative agent have been described (2) . The morphogenesis of the virus is also characteristic for a member of the coronaviridae family (1 5) . Histopathological, histochemical (COUSSEMENT et al., to be published), ultrastructural (DUCA-TELLE et al., to be published) and immunofluorescence studies (DEBOUCK et al., to be published) of the intestine in caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets have been done. These studies have shown that the lesions and the distribution of the viral antigen are similar to Transmissible Gastro-enteritis Viral infection, although with some restrictions: the lesions are slightly less severe, and the virus also replicates in the colonic epithelium but without causing any histological lesions.",

Desquamation could also be seen with SEM, leaving small areas on the villi completely denuded (Fig. 4) . Large amounts of cell debris and mucus were present between and adhering to the villi. The villi were severely distorted and shortened, almost completely losing their transverse foldings. At higher magnification of the desquamated areas, pores could sometimes be observed in the basal membrane (Fig. 5) . In the duodenum, ileum and colon lesions werc not seen with SEM at the time of onset of diarrhoea. Also later on the duodenum had no significant lesions, except some villous shortening. In the ileum moderate shortening and stunting of villi was seen about 6 h after the onset of clinical signs. Desquamation could sometimes be observed, leaving occasional denuded areas on the villous surface (Fig. 6) . The lesions were less and were of variable intensity as compared to the middle of the jejunum. In the colon alterations of the mucosal surface were not observed. Nevertheless at 6h after the onset of clinical signs, cellular debris, occasional erythrocytes, and small pseudomembranes could be seen covering the colonic epithelial surface (Fig. 7) .",

The presence of large amounts of cell debris and detritus between the villi in the early phase of diarrhoea is in contrast with the findings in porcine rotavirus infection (6) . The presence of this cell debris probably reflects the in wiwo situation more closely, since in the present study the intestine was not washed out during the preparation of the tissue specimens. Also these masses of debris in the intestinal lumen may account in part for the \"explosion-like\" distribution of immunofluorescence-positive material in the first 6 h after the onset of diarrhoea (DEBOUCK, personal communication).",

It was not observed in the present control material from newborn colostrum-deprived piglets. Also, in the period arround 60h after the onset of clinical signs, villous fusion in the jejunum was very severe, taking an aspect similar to the description of Three Weeks Enteritis of piglets (8) . The morphogenesis of these fused villi could not unequivocally be established in the present sequential study. Nevertheless, some indications were found that they were initiated as a narrow side-by-side synechia between adjacent villi, as has been suggested in man (12) . It was not possible to check whether this initial fusion was complete, as is suggested in colibacillosis of calves (IO), or whether it started as a bridge, as it appears in light microscopy.",

Desquamation of epithelial cells was most severe on jejunal villi at the time of onset of clinical signs. It was also seen at 6h after the onset of clinical signs in the ileum. Duodenum and colon remained normal. From 24h after the first clinical signs onwards, villous fusion was seen. The alterations of the mucosal surface are compared to those seen in other enteropathogenic conditions of pigs. ",

Bei Auftreten der ersten klinischen Symptome sowie sechs Stunden danach war die Desquamation der Epithelzellen des Jejunums am ausgepragtesten. Ab 24 Stunden nach der Infektion wurde eine Verschmelzung der Zotten untereinander beobachtet. Die Veranderungen der Schleimhautoberflache werden mit denen bei anderen enteropathogenen Prozessen verglichen.
