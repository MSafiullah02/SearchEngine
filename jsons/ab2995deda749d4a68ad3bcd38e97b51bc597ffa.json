Failure of immune tolerance and induced autoimmune processes are involved in MS immunopathogenesis. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play an important role in maintaining peripheral tolerance and immune homeostasis. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low/\u2212 Treg cells in MS patients. Methods: The study population was composed of 25 healthy controls (HCs), 35 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 25 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). Frequency of CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low/\u2212 Treg cells in RRMS and PMS patients was compared with HC by flow cytometry. Results: Treg cells frequency in PMS patients was significantly higher compared to RRMS patients (P < 0.001) and HCs (P < 0.001). It was lower in RRMS patients than HCs (P = 0.005). A Significant direct correlation between Treg cells frequency and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in PMS patients (P = 0.001, r = 0.6) was observed. Reverse correlation between Treg cells frequency and EDSS in RRMS patients was found (P = 0.01, r = \u22120.4). Conclusion: More detailed clarification of the role of Treg cells in MS patients could provide a basis for development of Treg cells-mediated therapeutic strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common autoimmune debilitating neurologic diseases that is characterized by demyelination and chronic inflammation of the CNS (Trapp and Nave, 2008) . There are two main categories of MS: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). RRMS, the most common type, is typified by irregular relapses followed by month-andyear-periods of relative quiet without symptoms. Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which does not fulfill the MS criteria, is frequently its starting point. PMS includes three types: secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) (Hawkes and Giovannoni, 2010; Confavreux and Vukusic, 2006) . The etiology of MS is not clearly but genetic, environmental, immunological factors and some viruses, e.g. EBV, CMV, HBV, HSV, human herpetic viruses 6 and 7, measles viruses, coronaviruses, may have a role in the occurrence of MS (Sospedra and Martin, 2005) . Myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers will be damaged in MS (Jiang and Chess, 2006; Dendrou et al., 2015) . The major immune cells involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS are T cells, especially TCD8 + , Th1 and Th17. Amounts of Th1 and Th17 cells and their associated cytokines, e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), have been shown to be increased in MS patients (Raphael et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014) . In recent years, it became clear that Treg cells also participate in immunopathogenesis of MS (Buc, 2013) . Treg cells are essential for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2019.100456 Received 2 July 2019; Accepted 11 July 2019 maintaining peripheral tolerance against self antigens through a variety of soluble mediators including IL-10, IL-35, TGF-\u03b2, and cell surface molecules such as CD25, and CTLA-4 (Tai et al., 2012; Collison et al., 2010) . There are multiple Treg subsets and a variety of suppressive mechanisms . Treg cells decrease activity and expansion of conventional T cells by suppressing their biological activities such as inhibition of proliferation and blocking the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Liu, 2006; Lan et al., 2005) . Quantitative or functional defect of Treg cells is associated with many autoimmune diseases, including MS, rheumatoid arteritis (RA), and Type 1 diabetes (T1D) (Sakaguchi et al., 2006; Long and Buckner, 2011) . The role of Treg cells in MS is controversial. While several studies reported a decrease in Treg cells frequency in MS patients (Huan et al., 2005; Haas et al., 2007; Venken et al., 2008a; Kouchaki et al., 2014) , a number of studies reported the same frequency compared to healthy subjects (Venken et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2005; Feger et al., 2007; Viglietta et al., 2004; Frisullo et al., 2009) . Moreover, other studies indicated a functional defect in Treg cells (Venken et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2005; Feger et al., 2007; Frisullo et al., 2009; Venken et al., 2008b) . Further studies are needed to understand the potential of Treg-based therapies in MS patients.

Consistent with this observation, may due to the clonal or functional exhausting and more migration of the most potent suppressor cells in RRMS patients to inflammatory sites, the function and frequency of Treg cells is lower in RRMS patients rather than PMS patients (Venken et al., 2006) .
