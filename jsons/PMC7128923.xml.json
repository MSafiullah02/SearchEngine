Only a few cases have been reported outside the Middle East [4], [5], [6], and no epidemic event outside the Middle East was seen before 2015. However, that year, the largest single-nation outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia occurred in South Korea over 45 days, with 186 confirmed MERS patients including 38 deaths (http://www.mers.go.kr/mers/html/jsp/Menu_C/list_C4.jsp) [7]. Because the main mode of transmission of MERS is respiratory droplet and most MERS transmission occurs in the nosocomial setting, healthcare workers (HCWs) in contact with confirmed MERS patients are at high risk of MERS infections [3], [8], [9]. In South Korea, among the 186 laboratory-confirmed MERS patients, 39 cases (21.0%) occurred in medical professionals or HCWs [9], [10].",

Therefore, it was suspected that asymptomatic or undetected MERS infection may present in some of the HCWs who had been involved in managing confirmed MERS patients. One previous study reported that 25% of MERS coronavirus (CoV) PCR-positive patients were asymptomatic, and among these, 64% were HCWs [3]. Moreover, the period in which MERS-CoV is present in respiratory specimens is unknown because the virus shedding mechanism is still ambiguous even in confirmed MERS patients, and the PCR positivity rate of asymptomatic patients remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG in HCWs exposed to MERS patients and to calculate the incidence of MERS affected cases in HCWs. Furthermore, we aimed to identify risk factors of MERS infection in HCWs.",

In general, isolation gown and gloves are recommended as a contact precaution, and surgical mask is recommended as a droplet precaution [16]. Although MERS is known to be transmitted by droplet and by direct contact, use of appropriate PPE, including an N95 respirator and an isolation gown, has been emphasized in preventing MERS infection (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/downloads/MERS-Infection-Control-Guidance-051414.pdf) [11], [12], [13]. In our study, only participants who were exposed to MERS patients without appropriate PPE had IgG antibody against MERS-CoV. This was also found in PCR-confirmed MERS-infected HCWs. Among the 39 PCR-confirmed MERS-infected HCWs (http://www.mers.go.kr/mers/html/jsp/Menu_C/list_C4.jsp) [10], we reviewed the 15 patients who were affiliated with our study's participating hospitals (data not shown). We found that 14 of these patients were exposed without using an N95 respirator. Therefore, in our participating hospitals, almost all MERS-infected HCWs were related to not using appropriate PPE. There were two exceptional cases; they had used isolation gowns and N95 respirators following the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/downloads/MERS-Infection-Control-Guidance-051414.pdf), but they were eventually infected with MERS. Both were exposed to AGP, intubation of a MERS patient (seropositive case in our study) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a MERS patient (PCR-confirmed MERS case). Although the fitting test was not performed in either case, we guess that the N95 respirator is less efficient in AGP for high-virus-burden patients. Consequently, appropriate use of PPE is important in protection of MERS, and when performing AGP, more efficient respirators might be necessary [11].",

M\u00fcller et al.\n[14] reported that only 10% of samples that received positive ELISA results for antibody to S1 antigen were positive in the neutralization assay. In their study, however, the IIFT was well correlated with the neutralization assay. Their report showed that ELISA alone was useful in screening for the presence of MERS-CoV IgG but not in confirming it, whereas the IIFT could substitute the neutralization assay. In another recent report, the correlation of MERS-CoV ELISA and neutralization assay was strong in PCR-confirmed MERS patients [18]. Therefore, our protocol, composed of screening by MERS-CoV S1 ELISA and confirming by IIFT, may be robust to detect truly seropositive samples.",

Secondly, two hospitals where large clustered cases developed did not participate in our study, and the incidence of MERS-affected cases in these hospitals may be higher than others. These hospitals included one that was visited by the first Korean MERS-infected patient and another at which the largest superspreading event occurred. In those hospitals, HCWs were not prepared for such a high risk of infection, and appropriate PPE was not used during the management of patients in the early period of outbreak.
