Turkey coronaviral enteritis is characterized by anorexia, watery droppings, marked dehydration, and decreased body weight gain (Gonder et al., 1976). Infection with TCV causes rapid histopathologic changes in the mucosa of the intestinal tract of turkeys. The major changes are the granularity of the epithelial cells, loss of microvilli, margination of chromatin in the nucleus, and increased cellularity of the lamina propria. These altered physical conditions of the mucosal cells cause failure of absorption, loss of appetite, and accumulation of fluids and gases in the intestinal tract, resulting in diarrhea (Deshmukh et al., 1974, Gonder et al., 1976).",

Even at the present time, it remains a serious threat to the turkey producers in North Carolina. The estimated loss was reflected by mortality, decreased feed efficiency, stunting, and medication cost. The clinical signs of the turkey poult enteritis usually appear at 7\u201328 days of age and include inappetence, wet droppings, ruffled feathers, decreased weight gain, growth depression, and uneven flock growth. Analysis of intestinal contents from affected turkeys by electron microscopy (EM) at Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Purdue University, often revealed the presence of coronavirus. The clinical signs of turkey poults with acute enteritis and the continuing finding of coronavirus were very similar to TCV-induced bluecomb disease of turkeys encountered in Minnesota in 1960 and 1970s. The purpose of the present study was to identify TCV isolate from the intestinal contents of turkey flocks with outbreaks of acute enteritis and characterize its morphological, serological, and molecular properties.",

Inoculation with the virus-containing filtrate from the intestinal homogenate did not kill turkey embryos. The intestinal tract of inoculated turkey embryos was more distended than that of normal turkey embryos. The intestinal contents were watery, gaseous, and greenish.

The major protein bands of the purified materials were grouped and compared to those reported for Minnesota or Quebec isolates of TCV (Dea and Tijssen, 1988a). The clear band close to 50 kDa may represent the N phosphonucleoprotein and the 200 kDa and a faint 100 kDa band may be the non-split and split form of the S peplomeric glycoprotein. The triplets of bands around 26, 30, and 32 kDa correspond to M protein. A diffuse band can be deduced between 52 and 60 kDa which may represent the monomeric form of the HE glycoprotein. The HA activity of purified TCV with rabbit erythrocytes was comparable to a previous report (Dea et al., 1985).",

Because there were no BCV or HCV-OC43 in the laboratory during the present study, the opportunity of contamination with either BCV or HCV-OC43 was very unlikely. The positive RT-PCR reaction and sequence of the PCR product should reflect the nature of the isolated TCV instead of contamination of BCV or HCV-OC43. Nevertheless, a single nucleotide substitution from G to A was seen. Spike protein of coronavirus has been known to be important for receptor binding and penetration of target cells during the infection process. The single nucleotide substitution from G to A at position 482 may be involved in the mechanisms of different host tropism. Further study on molecular analysis of full-length S gene of TCV is required to elucidate such information as well as the genetic relationships among TCV, BCV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).",
