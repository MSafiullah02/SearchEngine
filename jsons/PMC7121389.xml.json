            "text": "C-type lectins are characterized by a common structural C-type lectin domain (CTLD) that can bind glycan and non-glycan ligands in a Ca2+-independent manner; CTLDs that bind glycans in Ca2+-dependent manner are known as \u201ccarbohydrate recognition domains\u201d (CRD) (Zelensky and Gready 2005). The myeloid C-type lectin CLEC5A (also known as MDL-1) (Bakker et al. 1999) is a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled type II membrane protein comprising a C-terminal CTLD and a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Among the 15 groups of C-type lectins, CLEC5A falls into Group V (the NK cell receptor family) (Hsieh 2016), which includes CLEC7A (Dectin-1), CLEC5A, CLEC2, CLEC1, NK receptors (such as NKG2D, the NKRP1 family, the NKG2 family, CD69 and CD94), mast cell-associated functional antigen (MAFA), osteoclast inhibitory lectin (OCIL), and CD72. Similar to NKG2D, CLEC5A signals via the ITAM-containing DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12) when it is phosphorylated by Src upon activation (Hsieh 2016). However, the role of DAP10, a DAP12-related adaptor protein associated with NKG2D, in CLEC5A-mediated signaling remains unclear.",

The transmembrane domain contains a positively charged amino acid, Lys-58, which recruits DAP10 and DAP12 to associate with CLEC5A after activation. CLEC5A is mainly expressed by myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Chen et al. 2008), and is further upregulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)(Joyce-Shaikh et al. 2010). In addition, CLEC5A expression is under the control of the PU.1 transcription factor, which is a central regulator of myeloid cell differentiation (Batliner et al. 2011). Recent studies further demonstrate that CLEC5A expression is upregulated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (Cheng et al. 2016), suggesting CLEC5A is regulated by oxidative stress.",

The ligand for CLEC5A was unknown until it was shown to interact with glycan moieties on dengue virus (DV) (Chen et al. 2008), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (Chen et al. 2012) and type A influenza virus (IAV) (Teng et al. 2017). In addition, CLEC5A has been found to interact with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides on gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) (Chen et al. 2017). Moreover, CLEC5A has a critical role in the inflammatory responses associated with collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (Joyce-Shaikh et al. 2010) and Concanavalin A-induced liver inflammation (Cheung et al. 2011). Most recently it was demonstrated that CLEC5A interacts with exosomes released from activated platelets (Sung et al. 2019), though the ligand responsible has not been identified yet. In this review, we will discuss protective and pathogenic role of CLEC5A in viral and bacterial infections, and how CLEC5A collaborates with other C-type lectins in the recognition of various antigens.",

            "text": "It has been shown that host cells contain abundant endosomal sensors (such as TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) and cytoplasmic sensors (such as RIG-I, MDA5, cGAS) that detect the nucleic acids of DNA and RNA viruses (Schlee and Hartmann 2016). After endocytosis, viruses release nucleic acids that trigger receptor- and sensor-mediated signaling pathways to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons. These nucleic acid receptors and sensors nicely demonstrate how virus-infected cells produce interferons and inflammatory cytokines to limit viral replication and spreading. However, it is hard to explain how some viruses (such as dengue virus, H5N1 virus, SARS-Coronavirus, Ebola viruses etc.) trigger massive cytokine release from leukocytes (known as cytokine storm), thereby causing systemic permeability change and hemorrhagic shock. For example, dengue virus (DV) infection frequently causes high fever (>40 \u00b0C), rash, thrombocytopenia, back pain, retroorbital pain and joint pain (Wilder-Smith and Schwartz 2005), but can give rise to more severe symptoms, i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, due to elevated systemic vascular permeability and activation of platelets (Wilder-Smith and Schwartz 2005). In contrast, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with low-grade fever and persistent viremia, leading to fibrotic changes and hepatocellular carcinoma (Ganem and Prince 2004). These observations suggest that each virus must be able to trigger a distinct pathway in addition to nucleic acid receptor-/sensor-mediated signaling to modulate host immunity, thus resulting in various clinical symptoms and outcomes.",

Even though the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope is derived from host cell membranes, the envelope also contains proteins encoded by the viral genome. One of the best-studied viral envelope proteins is the E protein of dengue virus, which has two N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-67 and Asn-153 (Pokidysheva et al. 2006), where the terminal sugars include mannose, fucose, and GluNac (Modis et al. 2003). While the glycosylation site at Asn-153 is conserved in most flaviviruses, glycosylation at Asn-67 is unique for DV serotype 2 (DV2) (Heinz and Allison 2003). It has been shown that dengue virus interacts with the C-type lectin DC-SIGN via Asn-67 (Tassaneetrithep et al. 2003), while JEV interacts with DC-SIGNR via Asn-163 (Shimojima et al. 2014). In addition, E protein is a viral structural protein and is immunogenic; thus we speculated that this glycosylated viral envelope protein could be regarded as a \u201cvirus-associated molecular pattern\u201d (VAMP) that triggers host immune responses.",

DC-SIGN is shown to interacts with dengue virion via Asn-67 (Mondotte et al. 2007), thus dengue virion seems interacting with DC-SIGN and CLEC5A via Asn-67 and Asn-153, respectively. Furthermore, the affinity of the CLEC5A-DV interaction is much lower than that of the DC-SIGN-DV interaction, and colocalization of CLEC5A and DC-SIGN on macrophages was detected upon engagement with DV (Lo et al. 2016). All these observations suggest that DV form a multivalent hetero-complex with CLEC5A and DC-SIGN to activate macrophages via Syk-coupled CLEC5A. Because DC-SIGN is crucial for virus entry into dendritic cells and other DC-SIGN-positive myeloid cells (such as macrophages), DV2 is more efficient than other DV serotypes (DV1, DV3, DV4) and flaviviruses at infecting and replicating in dendritic cells and macrophages. On the other hand, CLEC5A recognizes all flaviviruses via the conserved Asn-153, supporting the notion that CLEC5A is a pan-pattern recognition receptor for all the flaviviruses. These observations suggest that viruses activate host defense mechanisms not only via nucleic acids (denoted as virus-associated molecular pattern-1, VAMP-1), but also activate innate immune receptors via their surface glycans (denoted as virus-associated molecular pattern-2, VAMP-2) (Fig. 3.2). While nonmyeloid cells are only activated by VAMP-1, macrophages and other myeloid cells are activated by both VAMP-1 and VAMP-2 via nucleic acid receptors/sensors and Syk-coupled C-type lectin, respectively; this enhances NFkB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine release to induce a severe cytokine storm. This dual activation pathway provides an explanation for why viruses capable of activating or replicating in macrophages (such as dengue virus, Ebola virus, Bunya virus, H5N1 IAV) frequently cause cytokine storms.\n\n",

While knockdown of DC-SIGN inhibits DV entry into macrophages with mild impairment on cytokine production, blockade of CLEC5A attenuates the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MIP1-\u03b1, IL-8, and IP-10 dramatically, without affecting IFN production. There is evidence (Chen et al. 2008) that all four serotypes of dengue virus (DV1-4) bind and activate CLEC5A to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, CLEC5A is also responsible for enhanced inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages incubated with immune complexes containing antibodies to DV E protein and DV pre-membrane protein (an in vitro system to mimic antibody-dependent enhancement of DV infection). This observation demonstrates that DV can activate dual receptor pathways; i.e., endosomal TLR7 and other nucleic acid sensors via viral RNA (VAMP-1), and CLEC5A via glycans and proteins on the viral envelope (VAMP-2). Thus, it should be possible to attenuate virus-induced inflammatory reactions without suppressing IFN-mediated anti-viral immunity. This was confirmed in vivo using an anti-CLEC5A mAb to treat DV-infected mice. Compared to isotype control, anti-CLEC5A mAb inhibited DV-induced plasma leakage, as well as subcutaneous and vital-organ hemorrhaging, thereby reducing mortality by about 50% in STAT1-deficient mice. Thus, blockade of CLEC5A offers a novel strategy for alleviating tissue damage and increasing survival rate in patients suffering from dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome (Chen et al. 2008).",

In addition, CLEC5A expression is much higher in GM-CSF-derived macrophages (GM-M\u03d5), compared to M-CSF-derived macrophages (M-M\u03d5) (Gonzalez-Dominguez et al. 2015). We found that DV activates CLEC5A to induce the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, leading to abundant release of IL-1\u03b2 from GM-M\u03d5 (Wu et al. 2013). Moreover, blockade of CLEC5A by an antagonistic mAb inhibits DV-induced NALP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion.

Therefore, dengue fever is also known as \u201cbreak-bone\u201d disease. However, the underlying mechanism for the pain experienced by dengue patients is still unclear. Because increased osteoclastic bone resorption is associated with pain, we asked whether DV infects osteoclasts and increases their osteolytic activity. We found that osteoclasts are highly susceptible to DV infection and that they produce high levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 following infection. In contrast, osteoclasts are resistant to WNV and JEV infection, and do not produce detectable proinflammatory cytokines in response to these viruses. Furthermore, DV activates NFATc1 to upregulate osteolytic activity via CLEC5A, and DV infection causes bone tissue inflammation and disturbance of bone homeostasis in stat1\u2212/\u2212 mice. While CLEC5A-induced proinflammatory cytokine release is via DAP12-mediated signaling, CLEC5A-induced osteolytic activity requires the formation of a CLEC5A/DAP12/DAP10 tri-molecular complex (Inui et al. 2009). Nevertheless, blockade of CLEC5A is able to suppress DV-induced bone inflammation and osteolytic activity in vivo (Huang et al. 2016), confirming the critical role of CLEC5A in osteoclast activation. It would be interesting to explore whether blockade of CLEC5A is able to reduce pain in dengue patients in the future.",

While the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IP-10 was downregulated in Clec5a\u2212/\u2212 mBMDM, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production was upregulated. Since mice lack orthologues of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, which are involved in IAV infection of human macrophages, the differential responses of mouse and human macrophages to IAV infection can be attributed to the presence or absence of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR. Nevertheless, Clec5a\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from the sublethal challenge of H5N1 virus by reducing the level of proinflammatory cytokine in the lungs, suggesting activation of CLEC5A plays a pathogenic role in IAV infection.",

It has been shown that free radical production is required for NET formation; however, TLR-mediated signaling does not contribute to ROS production (Gantner et al. 2003).

While TLR2 binds to teichoic acids, CLEC5A binds to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides of the Listeria cell wall. Thus, engagement of Listeria by neutrophils is associated with co-activation of TLR2 and CLEC5A to induce ROS and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, Clec5a\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to infection than Tlr2\u2212/\u2212 mice after intravenous inoculation with Listeria monocytogenes; Clec5a\u2212/\u2212Tlr2\u2212/\u2212 mice are extremely susceptible to infection with all mice dying within 5 days. These observations suggest co-activation of CLEC5A and TLR2 is critical to host defense against Listeria and Staphylococcus infections. Moreover, CLEC5A deficiency is associated with impaired production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and reduced the numbers of IL-17A-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which are critical for immunity to L. monocytogenes (Romagnoli et al. 2016) as well as contributing to autoimmune diseases (Papotto et al. 2018; Akitsu and Iwakura 2018). Therefore, CLEC5A/TLR2 activation is not only central to bacteria-induced inflammatory responses, but may also play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",

Immunofluorescent staining revealed that CLEC5A colocalizes with mannose receptor (MR) and DC-SIGN in the presence of DV infection, where both MR and DC-SIGN display higher binding affinities for DV compared to CLEC5A (Lo et al. 2016). This observation suggests that CLEC5A and other C-type lectins form a hetero-multivalent receptor complex to engage with DV (Fig. 3.3a). This model is in accord with our observation that dengue virions bind to DC-SIGN/CLEC5A via N-linked glycans associated with Asn-67 (mannose) and Asn-153 (fucose) on DV E protein (VAMP-2), thus activating CLEC5A to trigger downstream signaling. In addition, dengue virus enters macrophages via DC-SIGN and activates TLR7 by interaction with viral RNA (VAMP-1). Co-activation of CLEC5A and endosomal TLR7 leads to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine release from DV-infected macrophages (Chen et al. 2008). These observations suggest that viruses are captured by high-affinity receptors such as DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, and form a hetero-multivalent receptor complex with the low-affinity receptor CLEC5A via fucose on the viral envelope. This model is consistent with our observations in flaviviral and H5N1 viral infections and also predicts that CLEC5A on macrophages and dendritic cells will be activated by other microbes that harbor mannose and fucose moieties on their surfaces.\n",

The authors studied the association between susceptibility to severe dengue fever and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in candidate genes, including TNF, IL-10, MIF, DC-SIGN, CLEC5A, NOD2, CCR5 and MRC1. The most significant association was found between the TT genotype of CLEC5A (rs1285933 C > T) and severe dengue susceptibility (OR = 2.25; p = 0.03). In addition, the authors measured the serum levels of TNF, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3 at a critical disease phase in patients with different rs1285933 genotypes. Those with CT or TT genotypes exhibited higher levels of serum TNF than CC individuals, suggesting that CLEC5A variants might increase the risk of disease susceptibility and serum TNF level in dengue patients. In a subsequent analysis, the control cohort was divided into groups according to their IgG status, where IgG+ implied recent infection with mild to no symptoms and without hospital admission; here, only borderline significance was reported for the association between rs1285933 genotype and dengue severity (Xavier-Carvalho et al. 2013, 2017). To validate their findings and to decipher the role of CLEC5A genetic variants in dengue viral infection, Xavier-Carvalho et al. conducted a follow-up study. They recruited 213 hospitalized dengue patients and investigated the association of rs1285933 with disease severity. Consistent with their previous study, T carriers at rs1285933 were associated with a more severe manifestation in dengue fever. Furthermore, to investigate the role of CLEC5A after DV infection, the authors collected monocytes from healthy individuals and treated the cells with DV. The DV-infected monocytes showed increased CLEC5A mRNA and protein expression after infection. Among the groups, monocytes from CC genotype individuals showed higher CLEC5A protein expression 24 h after infection. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between TNF concentration in supernatants and CLEC5A protein 48 h after infection. However, there was no difference in dengue viral load or TNF expression among the different genotypes. Moreover, the authors observed only borderline significance for the association between CLEC5A mRNA levels in patients with mild dengue infection and the CC genotype; TNF mRNA expression showed no variation among mild dengue patients with different genotypes (Xavier-Carvalho et al. 2017).",

It is interesting to note that CD11b+Ly6G+CLEC5A+ cell numbers are increased after arthritis induction, and that injection of an agonistic anti-CLEC5A mAb further increases CD11b+Ly6G+CLEC5A+ cell infiltration into joint and aggravates disease severity.

These observations suggest that activation of CLEC5A can enhance the pathogenic effect of CD11b+Ly6G+CLEC5A+ cells in autoimmune arthritis (Joyce-Shaikh et al. 2010). This argument is supported by the observation that CLEC5A is highly upregulated in monocytes of rheumatoid arthritis patients (Chen et al. 2014). In addition, Concanavalin A-induced hepatitis is associated with infiltration of CD11b+GR1+Ly6G+Ly6C+CLEC5A+ immature myeloid cells into the liver, and activation of this cell population by an agonistic mAb activates eNOS leading to high levels of NO and TNF-\u03b1, thereby resulting in shock syndrome in this mouse model (Cheung et al. 2011).",

Moreover, CLEC5A is involved in the pathogenesis of aseptic inflammation, suggesting that it may also recognize various fucosylated endogenous danger signals. Blockade of CLEC5A attenuates inflammatory reactions, but without downregulating antiviral immunity (since it does not influence TLR-mediated IFN production), thereby protecting the host from virus-induced systemic inflammatory reactions. In addition to infectious diseases, CLEC5A+ cells mediate aseptic inflammation, e.g., in the contexts of collagen-induced arthritis and cigarette smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); blockade of CLEC5A inhibits the onset of arthritis and COPD. Thus, CLEC5A is a potential therapeutic target for various inflammatory diseases, and blockade of CLEC5A and associated TLRs may provide a means of protecting against both septic and aseptic inflammatory diseases.",
