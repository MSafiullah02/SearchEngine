When administering a vaccine to pregnant women, safety evidence must encompass the mother, the developing fetus, and subsequently the neonate, infant, and the child. Accumulating this safety data with the ability to reliably measure potential adverse events of interest is improved by standardization of definitions of potential adverse events and data collection in a manner that is applicable across all resource settings.",

The selection of criteria for inclusion or exclusion of subjects in the study is among the more critical study design decisions. In early phase clinical trials, it is common to enroll the healthiest populations to minimize risk. As the product profile is better defined in later stage studies, a broader group of individuals are generally enrolled. By Phase 3, study participants more closely mirror the target population for the vaccine and are enrolled in larger numbers, and it is typical to have fewer exclusion criteria.",

The selection of subjects and the selection of the risk threshold that is acceptable will depend on the type of vaccine being used, the phase of the clinical study, and various other factors such as the perception of risk and potential real risks in a given population. We sought to catalogue and provide specific data on adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with the more commonly utilized exclusion criteria, to guide the use of obstetric risks for the selection of participants in clinical trials of maternal immunization. Adverse outcomes may occur in normal low risk pregnancies without interventions. These obstetric risks do not imply an increased risk of vaccination. Therefore, a better understanding of obstetric risks may facilitiate not only a more informed choice of inclusion and exclusion criteria in these clinical studies of vaccines in pregnant women, but also a tailored use of obstetric risk criteria based on the phase of development of the vaccine.",

Because of obstetrics risks and the complexity of the maternal-fetal dyad, pregnant women have been considered a vulnerable population, excluded from participation in experimental trials of vaccines and drugs, particularly when these are not intended for the management of obstetric conditions. To facilitate inclusion of pregnant women in studies and research on immunizations targeting pregnant women, bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institues of Health have addressed and published guidance on inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials. Topics addressed have included ethical and consent consideration,[49] and development of standards for laboratory and physiologic parameters in pregnant women to assist in evaluation of outcomes in pregnant women participating in clinical trials.[50], [51], [52], [53], [54] General guidance on the conduct of research in pregnancy has been developed by the National Institutes of Health after conducting clinical trials of licensed and experimental vaccines since the 1980\u2019s, and global experience has been growing as more studies funded by industry and other organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are being pursued in all resource settings in the last decade.[1] Consensus statements, such as PREVENT, advocating for inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine trials are now published.[55] The exclusion of pregnant women and their infants from the benefits of potentially life-saving drugs and vaccines through clinical trials is no longer considered acceptable.[56], [57] At present, vaccines specifically for use in pregnant women against at least two pathogens: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS), are in clinical development. Active evaluation of these and other vaccines for women during or prior to pregnancy is ongoing (eg. Pertussis, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Hepatitis E).",

In clinical studies where there is a placebo or comparator group, similar frequency of obstetric adverse events is expected to occur in both groups. For Phase III trials, ideally the study population should mirror the target population. Exclusion criteria based on selection of women with low risk for obstetric complications can be too restrictive and limit the ability to assess safety of the vaccine in the populations who need it the most. Additionally, exclusion criteria may act indirectly to alter study results by excluding participants who would otherwise be at increased risk for a condition. For example, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is considered an important cause of stillbirth and preterm labor globally. Eliminating pregnant women with a prior stillbirth or prior preterm labor from participation in clinical research on GBS may also impact efficacy results of an intervention and may add bias to the study.[58], [59] In fact, inclusion of \u201chigher risk\u201d populations may better allow the ability to demonstrate differences between vaccine and control and potentially make a vaccine available to women sooner.",

While the assessment of exclusion criteria presented in this article does not differentiate obstetric risks from vaccine risks, the quantitation of risk may facilitate trialists\u2019 ability to consider appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria that reaches a balance between minimizing risk to participants and enabling inclusion of relevant populations. Its use may facilitiate not only a more informed choice of inclusion and exclusion criteria in these clinical studies of vaccines in pregnant women, but also a tailored use of these criteria based on the phase of development of the vaccine. Having more granular information about the obstetric risks, as provided in Appendix 3, may help trialists to anticipate the potential obstetric risks in each trimester. For instance, with spontaneous abortion risks mostly in the first trimester, or pre-eclampsia in the third trimester, a trialist could have a more accurate estimation of magnitude of adverse events, and consider these combined these considering the expected (background) risk in the studied population, the known or anticipated product safety profile, and the timing of the intervention (trimester of exposure) in pregnancy.

It is not designed to replace the clinical acumen and knowledge base that is offered by involving experienced obstetric providers and vaccine evaluators in trial design of vaccines in pregnancy. However, given that a standardized approach to the selection of participants in studies of vaccines in pregnancy is necessary, this information may serve to help clinical researchers reassess how conservative they need to be as a product progresses in development. The balance between deciding exclusion criteria and choosing a study population that mirrors the general population is complex. As clinical trials for vaccines specifically designed for an indication in pregnant women are novel, initial early phase trials may have more strict exclusion criteria. However, ongoing reassessment of criteria for inclusion in these and other protocols where pregnant women are study subjects will be imperative as data on background rates of expected obstetric events and safety information from epidemiologic studies and maternal immunization trials become more widely available.",
