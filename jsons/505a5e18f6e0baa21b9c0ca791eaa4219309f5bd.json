The JCI has been calling for action at all government levels to address the shortage and protect those who work heroically to care for infected patients with COVID-19. We can confirm that in Mexico, there have been \"hospital outbreaks\" with 329 HCPs who have been infected with COVID-19 throughout the country. Planning an adequate distribution of PPE to health workers and developing appropriate strategies in clinics can diminish the impact of this pandemic on HCPs. ",
