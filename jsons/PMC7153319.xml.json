            "text": "This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. As is the case with other species, rats are susceptible to a variety of injuries and diseases that can cause distress, morbidity, or mortality. Any facility that houses rats must develop monitoring programs designed to rapidly identify health-related problems, so they can be communicated to appropriately qualified veterinary or animal care personnel to be resolved. These programs generally consist of multiple components, some of which are directed toward individual animals, and others that assess the health status of rat populations as a whole. Relevant aspects of medical management of rat colonies include (1) individual animal monitoring for signs of illness and distress, (2) colony monitoring for morbidity and/or mortality trends, (3) microbiological monitoring of sentinel animals and/or the environment for the presence of monitored or excluded agents, (4) quarantine of incoming animals of unproven status, (5) screening of biological research materials brought into the colony, (6) diagnostic support for microbiological culture, serology, molecular diagnostics, necropsy, and histopathology, and (7) management of disease outbreaks.",

The persons given the responsibility for this observation need to have had sufficient training or previous experience with rats to adequately detect abnormalities that might be present. Grossly visible trauma or lesions may not always be present in ill rats, but subtler behavioral clues might be present. For this reason, it is important to be familiar with the normal range of behavioral patterns observed in healthy captive rats, which has been described (Saibaba et al., 1995). Methods in which rats are videotaped and later evaluated for facial conformations that are correlated with pain or distress, i.e., the Rat Grimace Scale, have been used as a research tool (Sotocinal et al., 2011), and similar use of these facial clues might have utility for real-time evaluation of rats for signs of pain or distress (Leung et al., 2016). Other research tools such as automated activity tracking may also have utility for identifying illness-related abnormal behaviors, even in social groups in some innovative housing environments (Brenneis et al., 2017).",

A very common constellation of findings indicative of pain, distress, or illness is piloerection, decreased activity, an ungroomed appearance, and often a hunched posture (National Research Council, 1992). Chromodacryorrhea (red staining and crusting around the eyes) is an accumulation of porphyrin-containing secretions that is sometimes associated with illness as a result of increased production due to stress or disease as well as decreased self-grooming behavior due to distress. Weight loss is another nonspecific finding, but since weight determination is a simple, rapid, objective, and noninvasive technique, it is commonly used to assess the general health status of an animal placed under observation. It should be realized that stress is not always manifested as an absolute weight loss in a growing animal, so it may be necessary to take into account the normal weight gain of young rats to document a variation.",

Because both the disease state and the use of xenobiotics (antibiotics, analgesics, antiinflammatory agents, etc.) can affect the physiology of animals in a way that is difficult to control within the experimental design and could invalidate a study (Lipman and Perkins, 2002), ill rats are often euthanized rather than treated. However, the situation surrounding the incident should be carefully considered to determine whether it is prudent to gather appropriate antemortem diagnostic samples and to submit the carcass for necropsy evaluation even if the animal is euthanized. Likewise, a process to monitor animal mortality records and to perform necropsy on animals whose death is suspicious is quite important, because in some cases such an evaluation can allow early detection of a problem that otherwise would reoccur and eventually affect a much larger group of animals.",

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe particular pharmaceutical dosages and treatment indications, but the reader can be directed elsewhere in this volume for disease-specific recommendations. Well-referenced and comprehensive formularies that include rat-specific drug dosages are also available, written for veterinarians in both the laboratory animal and \u201cexotic\u201d pet specialties (Carpenter and Marion, 2017, Hawk et al., 2005). When bloodwork is indicated for diagnosis of a rat health issue, small-volume sample collection and automated analyzers can provide useful data. However, dilution of samples should be done only when such methods have been validated, because dilution does not always lead to predictably proportional results (Johns et al., 2018, Moorhead et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Despite the fact that some infectious agents (for example, virulent strains of rat coronavirus) can induce readily identifiable abnormal physical signs, most infectious agents encountered in laboratory rat populations cause only subclinical disease. Such conditions can only be detected and identified via sensitive and comprehensive testing protocols (National Research Council, 1991). Despite the lack of observable morbidity or mortality, these subclinical infections pose a significant risk to the research conducted with affected animals because they can alter the background physiology of experimental subjects or cause variation and alteration in specific experimental responses. These adverse effects have been summarized in a number of reviews (National Research Council, 1991, Baker, 1998, Baker, 2003, Nicklas et al., 1999, Lipman and Perkins, 2002), and more recent studies continue to add to the list of potential adverse implications (Besselsen et al., 2008). Two of the physiologic processes that have specifically been shown to be altered by the presence of these infectious agents in rodents include immune function and neoplasia, which are quite relevant because immunology, transplantation, and cancer biology are three of the disciplines that have historically depended heavily upon the use of rats (Gill et al., 1989). As a result, one of the primary aims of a rat colony health-monitoring program is to document the presence or absence of particular infectious agents irrespective of any observable disease state. A term that is generally synonymous with colony health monitoring and is often used to convey this emphasis is microbiologic monitoring (Fujiwara and Wagner, 1994, Waggie et al., 1994).",

Because a comprehensive colony health-monitoring program is so vital in protecting the validity and reproducibility of experimental research data, it must be given appropriate priority in terms of budget, personnel, and other resources.

Terms that are less useful without detailed additional information include specific pathogen free (SPF) and conventional. In general use, SPF refers to animals that are (1) considered to be free of major pathogens and some or all opportunists, (2) maintained under housing and use conditions designed to protect this high-quality status by excluding infectious agents, and (3) monitored closely to assure that there is no undetected introduction of excluded agents. Conventional animals are usually considered to be those that originate from uncontrolled colonies that are not subjected to routine health monitoring, or those in which some degree of monitoring occurs but there is no action taken if infectious agents are found. However, these terms are not really descriptive or representative enough to use when assigning risk to animals proposed for introduction to monitored, disease-free animal facilities. For example, animals from an institution that experienced an outbreak of rat coronavirus and decided not to undertake the steps needed to eliminate the agent from the facility can still be considered to be \u201cSPF\u201d, since by definition this status is only defined by the particular list of agents of which the animals are specifically free. The term conventional also suffers from some ambiguity, since it can be used to refer not only to animal health status but also to facility design. For example, a facility that allows direct staff entry into rat rooms without changing out of street clothes would be termed a conventional facility rather than a \u201cbarrier\u201d in the purest sense, but if microisolators and high-efficiency particulate air-filtered changing hoods have been used to successfully institute pathogen exclusion at the cage level, the animals themselves might possess a high-quality health status that is far from \u201cconventional.\u201d In practice, it may be more effective to communicate the specific panel of agents for which the animals have been tested rather than assigning generalized quality descriptions.",

            "text": "Health monitoring is often performed on representative residents removed from the colony for specific testing. When selecting animals for screening, there are certain points to keep in mind. Animals to be sampled should be taken from rack and shelf locations spread throughout the room to maximize the possibility of detecting an isolated focus of contamination. If multiple stocks or strains are present, an attempt should be made to sample representative rats from each of these subcolonies. It is also desirable to test both young and old animals (avoiding geriatric animals) if they are available, since parasite burdens may be higher in the young (National Research Council, 1991), while the old would have had the best chance of seroconverting to agents that may have not yet affected younger animals. In a breeding colony, ideal choices might be retired breeders and surplus weanlings. Immunodeficient animals are a good choice for detecting parasites and bacterial contamination, since they may have a lowered resistance to such agents and as a result support higher burdens. However, it is important to remember that serology will be subject to false-negative results if performed on an animal with a genetic or induced immunosuppression that may impair the antibody response. The purpose of health surveillance is generally not to accurately determine the specific prevalence of infection or disease in an area, but rather to accurately identify its presence by finding at least one positive animal in an endemic colony (National Research Council, 1991). The minimum number of animals from a population that need to be tested to identify one positive animal can be viewed as a statistical exercise in random sampling. Probability theory can provide the equation necessary to determine the sampling size needed, based on the assumption that one is dealing with an ideal population (i.e., 100 or more animals, where all animals have an equal opportunity for pathogen exposure) and calculated based on variables such as the prevalence of infection (often estimated at 30%) within the population and the degree of confidence required in the result (Clifford and Clifford, 2001). These equations have been used to prepare charts that have been published to assist in the selection of sample size (Small, 1984, DiGiacomo and Koepsell, 1986, National Research Council, 1991). For example, if an infectious agent affects 25% of the rats in a population, one would only need to test 15 randomly selected individuals to have a 99% probability of detecting the agent. These calculations have the most robust application when dealing with large populations of animals held under conditions that provide little or no barrier to cage-to-cage transmission (e.g., an open shoe box or suspended caging with no filter tops) because, under those circumstances, agents are fairly uniformly distributed and would be expected to have a prevalence of 30% or higher. Under those circumstances, even if a room holds 1000 rats, it would still only be necessary to sample 8 of them to be 95% sure that an agent is not present. Many vendor quality assurance programs are based on this type of calculation.",

            "text": "Alternatives to a random sampling approach are needed because a large percentage of rats in contemporary research colonies are housed under circumstances that do not result in a uniform distribution of transmissible agents, due to the popularity and utility of cubicles (segregating fewer than 100 animals into functional groups) and/or systems that provide a barrier at the cage level, such as static microisolators or ventilated rack caging. These housing systems are beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of disease transmission, but they also make it harder to detect infectious agents based on random screening protocols because the agent distribution is not uniform and the prevalence of infection may be far below 30%. Another problem with random screening techniques is the impracticality of selecting and testing animals from active research colonies without disrupting the ongoing research. For this reason, it is common to place sentinel animals into a colony for the sole purpose of health status testing. These animals are not assigned to any particular study, and under ideal circumstances they will be exposed to the same agents as the principal animals actually being used for research or breeding. Because they exist solely for the screening program, sentinels can be bled, sampled, or removed for nonsurvival testing at the discretion of the colony management without interfering with ongoing experiments.",

The use of aged rats should be avoided if possible, because these animals may be more prone to false-positive seroreactivity (Wagner et al., 1991). Selection of a particular stock or strain of rat to be used as sentinels will vary, and there is no single correct choice. Using the same stock and source as the principals that are being monitored may be ideal because it eliminates the additional risk of contamination that would occur if animals were imported from another source specifically to be used as sentinels (National Research Council, 1991). For closed breeding colonies, this can be done by setting aside some of the animals bred locally to be used as sentinels, and if animals are commercially obtained, extra animals can be ordered along with the principal shipment. However, this approach is not always practical in nonclosed colonies consisting of animals of varying backgrounds from multiple sources, so it is common for facilities to order separate animals from a reliable commercial source to be used specifically as sentinels. In this case, a readily available outbred line is often chosen for sentinel use, since they are inexpensive and will generally mount a robust antibody response. Inbred lines can also be used, but it is important to consider any strain-specific limitations of disease susceptibility or immune responses, since these may affect their utility as sentinels. Occasionally, sentinels will be chosen specifically so that they have a coat color that differs from the principal animals to minimize the possibility that they will be mistaken for experimental animals and inadvertently used in experiments or for breeding.",

It is desirable to place them in a consistent spot on each rack so that husbandry and research staff can anticipate their location. If a single cage is used, it is customary to place it on the bottom shelf, since it is assumed that the concentration of aerosolized agents and particulate fomites will be highest near the floor. There are no firm guidelines for the relative density of sentinels, but for logistical reasons at least one sentinel cage should be in place on each rack or in each cubicle. The placement of one sentinel cage on each side of a cage rack (holding \u223c25\u201336 cages) has historically worked well in most situations. Other approaches can be taken, such as allocating sentinel cages to each breeding or experimental subgroup, placing multiple cages on each rack to increase the theoretical sensitivity of the program, etc. Depending on the specific design of the program, each sentinel cage may contain either a single animal or a small group of rats. When multiple sentinels of the same age are kept in a cage, it is rarely useful to sample more than one at any time, since the microbiological status of cohabitating animals is generally uniform. The use of sentinels in pairs does offer two advantages in that the other sentinel in the cohort can be used to confirm positive results found in the rat initially submitted for testing, and this also gives sentinel animals an opportunity for social contact. However, use of pairs does increase the numbers of animals utilized so this should be considered as well.",

This is done to increase the exposure of the sentinels to environmental contamination that might be transmitted by either true aerosols or small particulate fomites that are generated and dispersed within the room as part of routine rodent care and use. However, it should be noted that, in this type of situation, the subpopulation of rats with the highest cumulative risk of becoming infected with an agent (for example, the sentinel cages receiving a constant flow of dirty bedding) are not being held with the same degree of cage-level containment as the principal animals, and if they do become infected, the amount of environmental contamination and subsequent cross-contamination to other cages in the home room or elsewhere may be increased. Since other open sentinel cages in the room would be at highest risk for secondary transmission, it also may become more difficult to determine the point of origin of an agent within a room if sentinels are becoming infected, not from their assigned principal cages, but from other sentinel cages. This can essentially give a type of false-positive result (Weisbroth et al., 1998). During the sentinel program planning process, the benefit of a potential increase in the sensitivity of open-caged sentinels to detect an agent needs to be balanced against these potential adverse effects.",

The specific procedures utilized for the collection of soiled bedding and the transfer to sentinel cages vary widely as a result of the different types of cage/rack/hood configurations that are used and because they must integrate with the specific procedural methods being used for overall cage changing. However, to ensure that the transfer of bedding is having a net positive impact on colony health (by aiding in the detection of excluded agents) rather than a net negative impact (by increasing the cage-to-cage transmission between principal cages) this practice should be standardized and incorporated into both written procedural descriptions and employee training programs. It should be realized that dirty bedding transfer may not reliably transmit all agents of concern in rodent colonies. For example, studies in both mice and rats suggest that coronavirus infections may be relatively easy to detect, but the respiratory mucosa-associated Filobacterium rodentium (previously known as CAR bacillus) may be difficult to transmit via transferred bedding and fecal pellets (Dillehay et al., 1990, Artwohl et al., 1994, Cundiff et al., 1995, de Bruin et al., 2016).",

The time it takes a sentinel to be exposed to endemic infection would be expected to vary depending on specifics such as (1) the relative density of sentinels, (2) the frequency of cage changing and soiled bedding transfer, (3) the percentage of principal cages that have bedding sampled at each change, (4) the caging system in place, (5) the prevalence and transmissibility of the infectious agent present, and (6) possibly the macroenvironmental characteristics of the room, such as relative humidity and ventilation. Once a sentinel is exposed, there will be an additional delay until the development of an immune response ascends to levels that can be detected by serologic means. Experimentally, it has been shown that sensitive antibody determination tests can identify seroconversion in a period as short as 1 week postexposure for rats infected with agents such as the rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus (RCV/SDAV) (Smith, 1983) and the rat virus (RV) parvovirus (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002). However, a more \u201caverage\u201d timeframe is within the range of 2\u20133 weeks, and it is felt that the utility of testing results will be greatest if a period of 21\u201328 days is allowed for seroconversion. For this reason, sentinels should generally not be sampled before they have had at least 1 month of exposure. It cannot be assumed that an agent will make its way into a sentinel cage during the first week or two, so many programs allow for an exposure period longer than 1 month (for example, utilizing 2\u20133 months of exposure as part of a quarterly monitoring schedule). Of course, with the increasing use of PCR in screening programs, it is possible to directly assay for the presence of nucleic acids signifying the presence of viral, bacterial, or parasitic contamination in samples such as fecal pellets, skin scrapings, or plucked hair.",

Sampling of animals that are euthanized immediately upon arrival can provide confirmation of the health status of the animals as maintained by the vendor, although it should be recognized that serology would generally not be expected to consistently identify animals infected less than a week previously. PCR testing, bacterial culture, and direct examination for parasites can identify contamination over a shorter period of time, but there may still be a latent period. If the intent is to fully evaluate the status of all animals delivered, this testing must be repeated for each breeding unit of animals accepted from the vendor, and it should also account for the fact that vendors may produce the same strain in multiple, physically distinct breeding or holding areas (Small, 1984). Such a program might be feasible for facilities with a very limited list of vendors and a small number of strains in use, but is often impractical for facilities that serve large, multidisciplinary institutions. In this situation, a more limited and targeted vendor surveillance program might be useful (for example, surveying animals when a new vendor is under consideration, or getting more information if there are specific concerns about the status of animals from a particular vendor for some reason). Occasionally, the status of the vendor's production colony is not in question, but possible contamination during transport and delivery is suspected. If that is the case, incoming vendor animals for testing should not be killed upon arrival, but should be placed in a quarantine facility that provides for not only containment but also exclusion of infectious agents (to eliminate confounding cross-contamination within the facility). They can then be given time to fully colonize with and/or seroconvert to agents they were exposed to in transport, and tested on a schedule similar to other animals subjected to quarantine.",

Room-level isolation would be ideal, but often there are space constraints when dealing with small shipments of rodents, and the common procedure is to utilize flexible-film isolators, cubicles, or ventilated cabinets of some type to partition a quarantine room (Small, 1984). In contemporary colonies, the introduction of a novel, noncommercial rat strain is a much less frequent occurrence than the transfer of a mutant mouse line. However, if this activity increases in the future, it may be necessary to consider programs similar to those described for mouse quarantine that group multiple shipments into a single cohort for batch testing (Rehg and Toth, 1998). The availability of microisolator-type caging, either as static units or within ventilated racks, has also allowed programs to be designed that are not all-in-all-out but still allow functional isolation and segregation of multiple shipments within the same room (National Research Council, 1996, Otto and Tolwani, 2002). Although this option will provide more flexibility and may reduce the space requirements for quarantine, appropriate operational procedures are extremely important, since the whole system is reliant upon proper technique.",

Recent experiences have shown that even cell-free biologicals have the potential to introduce agents to rodent colonies when imported (Lipman et al., 2000). Similar to the procedures used for mouse tissues, a rat antibody production (RAP) bioassay can be performed, whereby na\u00efve animals held in quarantine are inoculated with a representative aliquot of the suspect material and tested 4\u20136 weeks later for seroconversion to excluded agents (Small, 1984; Johnson, 1986).

Although rarely encountered in rat colonies maintained at a high health status, some institutional veterinarians choose to monitor for Seoul virus and the bacterial agent Streptobacillus moniliformis, because they can cause a zoonotic disease and could be a marker for wild rat contamination (Bleich and Nicklas, 2008, Eisenberg et al., 2016a, Eisenberg et al., 2016b, Firth et al., 2014, Cross et al., 2014, Kerins et al., 2018, Mc et al., 2017, McElhinney et al., 2016, Verner-Carlsson et al., 2015, Easterbrook et al., 2008).

One approach to health monitoring is to group agents that pose a similar biosecurity risk based on prevalence in the population. For example, relatively prevalent agents such as coronavirus, parvoviruses, RatPyV2, rat theilovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, Helicobacter spp., Rodentibacter pneumotropicus, Rodentibacter heylii, Rodentibacter ratti (formerly Pasteurella pneumotropica biotype Jawetz, Heyl, and Taxon B), and pinworms might be tested for on a quarterly basis, while more infrequently detected agents such as Seoul virus, adenovirus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), reovirus, Sendai virus, Salmonella spp., and S. moniliformis could be surveyed on a semiannual or annual basis (Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Liang et al., 2009).",

An ideal test is one that in all cases clearly distinguishes between infected and uninfected animals (Weisbroth et al., 1998). Diagnostic tests can be appraised via several parameters [Table 11.3\n(Bellamy and Olexson, 2000)]. In general, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are of greatest importance when designing a health monitoring program. Tests with high sensitivity will generate a very low percentage of false-negative results, whereas tests with high specificity will generate a low percentage of false-positive results. Tests with high (>90%) sensitivity and specificity (for example, serology) should be used when available. For those tests that lack sensitivity or specificity (for example, histology), results must be interpreted accordingly. Other parameters, such as positive and negative predictive values, may also be of value in interpreting results; however, these parameters can be affected by agent prevalence. For example, when agent prevalence in a population is low, the calculated negative predictive value is high; conversely the positive predictive value may be misleadingly low (Lipman and Homberger, 2003). In other words, for an agent with low prevalence in the population, a negative test result confidently rules out the presence of disease, whereas a positive test result may be due to a false positive rather than a true positive. While highly sensitive and specific tests are available, it should be realized that no test is 100% sensitive or 100% specific. To this end, all unexpected results should be confirmed either using corroborative testing platforms, testing of cohort animals, or both. In no case should a decision about colony status be made based on a single positive result.",

Recognition of clinical signs is especially important in the early detection of outbreaks of disease and documenting emerging diseases. However, because most agents that infect rats cause subclinical disease, observation is a very insensitive means of screening for infectious disease. As a result, sentinel and colony monitoring programs have been developed. For health monitoring, animals may either be euthanized and a necropsy examination performed, or samples may be collected from live animals such as blood for serology, feces for molecular diagnostics, swabs of the oral cavity for microbiological culture, or perianal tape test samples for pinworms.",

Proper conduct of the necropsy is critical because there is only a single opportunity to conduct the procedure. Although there are many variations of necropsy technique, one should use systematic examination to ensure that all lesions and specified target tissues for collection are thoroughly examined macroscopically, as well as collected for subsequent experimental evaluation such as histopathologic analysis. The actual necropsy technique used depends on the objectives of the procedure. Most rat necropsies are conducted within the following categories: (1) diagnostic necropsy for determination of cause of clinical outcome, (2) rodent health surveillance, (3) complete necropsy for experimental purposes, and (4) target organ collection or evaluation. The methods used for these differing purposes will vary quite substantially and have been reviewed (Feldman and Seely, 1988).

Artifacts can be produced by a number of conditions, including excessive tissue manipulation, improper dissection technique, poor instrumentation, osmotically injurious moistening fluids, autolysis, and poor fixation. Excessive digital manipulation and improper use of instruments, such as the use of dull instruments, can easily lead to injury of fresh tissue with distortion of normal tissue architecture. This is particularly true with rats, in which small tissues are easily distorted by poor handling, such as crush injury resulting from improper scissor use. It is important to optimize dissection technique. For example, stretching the optic nerve during removal of the globe from the skull can lead to extensive artifacts such as retinal detachment. Artifacts can result from the drying of tissues or the contact of tissues with fluids that are not osmotically compatible. These changes can be reduced by the use of physiological saline as a moistening fluid and the avoidance of tissue contact with water. Artifacts of autolysis can be minimized by the proper use of fixatives and by ensuring rapid mucosal contact with fixatives. The need for rapid fixation means that it is important to flush rat nasal passages with fixative and to infuse fixative intraluminally into bowel segments.",

One must carefully consider the ancillary tests that will be performed on samples taken at necropsy, and this may dictate the order of collection and the necropsy methods that are chosen. For example, animal health and sentinel rat necropsies used to determine the pathogen status of colonies might necessitate aseptic technique and methods to acquire proper tissue samples for microbiological analysis. The specific types of organisms that might need to be cultured and the proper media to have available should also be considered in advance. Similarly, samples might need to be analyzed for the presence of macroscopically visible ecto- or endoparasites using special methods.

There are situations in which individuals each having a particular necropsy task are preferable to the use of multiple stations in which each individual performs a complete necropsy. One must carefully determine the need for randomization of animals across study groups at the terminal sacrifice. Sometimes randomization is warranted; at other times it might be useful first to necropsy controls before experimental animals to allow easier determination of macroscopic observations. Whenever multiple prosectors are used, careful records need to be kept about who is responsible for individual prosections or individual organs. It is important to have individuals work across experimental groups to prevent operator-specific tissue handling artifacts from being confused with experimental outcomes.

Some prosectors favor corkboards or disposable or Styrofoam boards because they allow the use of pushpins to fasten rodents to the surface. In general, the surface should be easily cleaned between animals. If cork is used it must be covered with disposable paper, which is changed between animals, and the board must be thoroughly scrubbed at the end of the day. Lighting and magnification are important factors to consider during the design of the rat necropsy station because both tissues and lesions can be quite small.",

Poor choice of instruments or instruments that are dull and soiled will cause tissue artifacts despite otherwise good dissection technique. An example includes large scissors, 15\u201318 cm in length, with sharp/blunt points that are suitable for the initial cutting through the skin and opening up the body cavities. For dissection of internal organs, various smaller, 10\u201313-cm long scissors, either straight or curved with blunt/sharp or sharp/sharp points, are adequate. Scalpels with no. 11 or no. 22 blades for trimming tissues are useful and may be used to prevent artifacts related to tissue compression from scissors. Various straight and curved forceps are used during the rodent necropsy, and \u201crat-toothed\u201d forceps are helpful for gripping surrounding tissues, although great care must be used to prevent injury to target tissues.

Fixatives are chemicals or physical processes that are used to \u201cfix\u201d in time the relationships among cells, cellular components, and extracellular matrix (Jones, 2001). Unfortunately, each combination of fixation, processing, and staining is a compromise as to the best representation of the living tissue. Thus there is no ideal fixation protocol, and one must bear in mind the purpose and needs of the study and the endpoints being studied. Chemical fixation is a complex topic for which there are many excellent reviews (Eltoum et al., 2001, Jones, 2001). The advent of molecular pathology has increased the need for a prospective consideration of fixation protocols. One should always avoid \u201coverfixation\u201d in aldehyde-based fixatives such as the 10% neutral buffered formalin used as the most common fixative in the laboratory. Overfixation can impair certain histological analyses such as immunohistochemistry. For routine histology, tissue specimens are fixed by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for 24\u201348 h. Many research necropsy procedures, such as those that involve nervous tissue examination or special target organ studies, will involve intravascular perfusions of fixative using flow and pressure control. The best way to avoid overfixation is to fix for a specified amount of time and then transfer tissues to 70% alcohol or buffer or to process quickly to paraffin.",

For rapid and uniform fixation, tissues should not be more than 3\u20135 mm thick. Other commonly used fixatives for rats include Bouin's solution for reproductive and fetal tissues, Davidson's fixative for ocular and male reproductive tissues, and Zenker's solution for eyes. For ultrastructural studies using electron microscopy, glutaraldehyde and Karnovsky's fixative are commonly used on very small pieces of tissue. Many of these fixatives entail hazardous agent handling and special waste-handling considerations.

Sample types suitable for serological testing include serum, plasma, and dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. DBS sampling involves the collection of a single drop (\u223c25 \u03bcL) of whole blood onto filter paper. The DBS sample, once dry, is very stable and amenable to a variety of quantitative and qualitative analyses. DBS sampling was first introduced in 1963 as a means to measure phenylalanine levels for the diagnosis of phenylketonuria in newborns (Guthrie and Susi, 1963). Since that time, DBS samples have been implemented in newborn metabolic disease screening, molecular testing for infectious disease diagnosis, therapeutic drug monitoring, and preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic testing in rodents. Serology offers several advantages: (1) samples can be obtained from a euthanized, anesthetized, or restrained rat; (2) multiple tests can be performed on a single sample; (3) antibodies (IgM followed by IgG) are detectable 1\u20132 weeks following exposure to the infectious agent; (4) serum antibody is long lasting (months), so the organism does not need to persist in the host for the infection to be detected; and (5) the antigens used in serologic assays can be highly purified, rendering these tests very sensitive and specific (Hsu et al., 2007, Livingston and Riley, 2003).",

It is classically constructed by coating a 96-well microtiter plate with the antigen of interest and detection of the analyte is achieved through enzyme-mediated amplification of the signal. In contrast, MFI utilizes a microsphere array as the solid phase for antigen coating and detection of analyte is accomplished with a fluorescent reporter. MFI offers several advantages over traditional ELISA, including: (1) simultaneous detection of antibodies to as many as 100 different antigens in a single reaction well; (2) as little as 1 \u03bcL of undiluted serum is required per reaction well, regardless of the number of different microsphere\u2013antigen complexes in the reaction well; (3) multiple antigens for a single agent can be evaluated simultaneously, offering internal confirmation of exposure to that agent if antibodies are detected in the sample; (4) compatibility with various sample types (serum, plasma, and DBS); and (5) the fluorescence reporter provides a greater dynamic range of detection and generally greater sensitivity (Hsu et al., 2007, Khan et al., 2005, Ravindran et al., 2010, Schmidt et al., 2017). MFI is also adaptable to automation; thus a large number of samples can be rapidly screened. The workflows for ELISA and MFI are similar. In general, indirect serological tests utilize antigen bound to a solid phase (ELISA, 96 well plates; MFI, microspheres). The specimen is then incubated with the solid phase and if antibody to the antigen is present, it will bind in a specific manner. Antibodies not specific for the antigen are removed in subsequent washing steps. Following the wash steps, conjugated (ELISA, enzyme; MFI, biotin) antirat immunoglobulin secondary antibody is added. These bind to rat antibodies that were bound in the first step. The last step involves the addition of a reporter (ELISA, enzyme substrate; MFI, streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin). The intensity of the reporter signal (ELISA, colorimetric; MFI, fluorometric) is proportional to the concentration of agent-specific antibody present in the specimen.",

Briefly, bacteria or virus-infected cells affixed to wells of a glass slide are probed with a test specimen. Following a wash step, fluorescent dye-conjugated antirat immunoglobulin secondary antibody is added, washed, and slides are read with an epifluorescence microscope. The added advantage of the IFA is that the cellular location and pattern of fluorescence can be evaluated to differentiate specific and nonspecific reactivity. For example, predominant cytoplasmic or nuclear fluorescence may be consistent with certain viral infections as opposed to diffuse fluorescence, which may indicate a nonspecific reaction. IFAs are relatively inexpensive, but more expensive than ELISA and MFI. The major disadvantages of IFA are that it is labor intensive and interpretation is dependent on the expertise of the diagnostician. The choice between ELISA, MFI, and IFA is based on personal preference of the laboratory. These tests are often used in combination, with the ELISA and/or MFI serving as the primary test modality and the IFA serving as a confirmatory test.",

Serological surveillance has provided a bulwark against the spread of infectious agents for several decades and has performed a central role in improving the health standard for rodent research models. The major advantage of serology is that agent-specific antibodies persist for months to years despite the transience of the agent. This footprint of infection provides a large window of opportunity to diagnose infections; however, serologic testing at a single time point cannot distinguish active from prior infections. Although serology has few limitations, it is unreliable in the diagnosis of infections in immunodeficient rodents (Compton and Riley, 2001, Livingston and Riley, 2003). MFI, ELISA, and IFA are subject to nonspecific reactivity, which can lead to false-positive results. This is especially true in bacterial serological assays due to the complexity and abundance of potentially cross-reactive bacterial antigens. With improvements in antigen production and reagents, false-positive results are uncommon. However, because of this possibility, a single positive should always be confirmed with additional testing. Nonspecific reactivity may also occur in serum from aged rodents over 6 months old (Wagner et al., 1991), strains subject to autoimmunity, animals whose immune systems are nonspecifically stimulated because of injury, neoplasm, other noninfectious disease processes, or other types of antigenic stimulation (Wagner et al., 1991, Weisbroth et al., 1998).",

The use of highly purified subunit antigens may increase specificity as cross-reactive impurities are not present. However, the use of these subunit antigens may negatively impact sensitivity (Compton and Riley, 2001). This happens because the host response is polyclonal, with many antibodies being produced to different antigenic epitopes on the infectious agent. Highly purified subunit antigens may lack the immunodominant epitopes to which antibodies have been produced and result in a test with decreased sensitivity when compared to one that utilizes crude protein preparations. Moreover, agents may express different epitopes during different stages of disease. Therefore an assay that uses an antigen that is only expressed at certain stages may miss some infections. In practice, a balance is sought so that purified preparations of multiple antigens are used, resulting in very sensitive and specific assays.",

Culture is especially useful when clinical evidence of bacterial infection is present (e.g., peritonitis, pyometra, and abscessation). Culture is most effective during the height of infection, and prior to administration of antibiotics or the development of an immune response (Compton and Riley, 2001). Culture may also be used as a screening tool for pathogens or agents capable of causing opportunistic infections. In the latter scenario, mucosal sites of the intestinal tract (for example, the cecum) and respiratory tract (for example, the nasopharynx) are cultured on broad spectrum or selective media. Culture has the advantage of determining whether a live agent is present, as opposed to potentially nonviable DNA remnants or antibacterial antibodies from a past infection. Culture does have some drawbacks. For example, agents colonizing the mucosal surface may be present in low numbers or sequestered in areas not accessed by routine procedures (for example, the deep recesses of the nasal turbinates). Moreover, fastidious organisms may not grow well unless conditions are optimized, or their growth may be hindered by the growth of more vigorous bacteria. Some agents may take several days to grow into identifiable colonies, while some agents such as F. rodentium and C. piliforme have yet to be cultivated on cell-free media. Collection of samples for submission to diagnostic laboratories may also be problematic in that some bacteria, notably the Pasteurellaceae, do not survive well in transfer media.",

More recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has emerged as a revolutionary tool for microbial identification (Singhal et al., 2015, Goto et al., 2012). MALDI-TOF MS is based on laser-induced ionization and desorption of microbial proteins and peptides. The protonated ions are accelerated in a vacuum containing a fixed high-voltage electric field. The time required for the microbial proteins to reach the detector is a direct function of the mass to charge (m/z) ratio, creating a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). The PMF pattern, representative of highly abundant ribosomal proteins, is unique for each species and is used to speciate microorganisms by matching the PMF pattern of an unknown specimen with the PMF patterns of highly characterized microorganisms contained in the database. Fig. 11.5\nshows the PMF of Staphylococcus aureus. MALDI-TOF MS improves the precision and rapidity of microbial identification compared to traditional methodologies. Culture and subsequent biochemical or MALDI-TOF MS analyses are very specific for most agents and can be supplemented with molecular techniques where precise speciation or strain identification is desired.",

Double-stranded sample DNA is denatured into two single strands. Oligonucleotide primers specific for the agent (complementary to the specific microorganism genome and typically situated approximately 100 base pairs apart) are added and allowed to anneal to target sequences in the sample DNA. A polymerase (for example, Taq polymerase), an enzyme that functions in DNA synthesis, is added along with nucleotide bases and new DNA strands of a specific size are created. After \u201cn\u201d cycles of this three-step process of denaturation, annealing, and synthesis, the target sequence is amplified 2nth times (30 cycles = 230\n = 1,073,741,824 copies of DNA). RNA (RNA viral genomes) may also be detected by PCR. In this case, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is utilized. With RT-PCR, RNA is converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the enzyme, reverse transcriptase. The cDNA then becomes the template for PCR. The PCR product may then be subjected to gel electrophoresis, and if a targeted sequence is amplified, it will migrate to a specific location in the gel based on its molecular weight. Real-time PCR assays using fluorescently labeled sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes are commonly used for rodent health monitoring (Feldman and Feldman, 2001, Besselsen et al., 2002, Besselsen et al., 2003, Drazenovich et al., 2002, Uchiyama and Besselsen, 2003).

PCR is an ideal primary test for the detection of active or persistent infections (for example, infections by parvoviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Mycoplasma pulmonis, Helicobacter spp.) or those agents for which other diagnostic tests are of poor sensitivity (for example, the culture of Helicobacter spp.). In contrast, detection of infections where colonization is transient (many viral infections) is possible for only brief periods of time. In the latter case, PCR may serve as an adjunct test. In this scenario, infections may be detected by a primary test such as serology. To confirm infection, additional rats of appropriate target age (an age at which colonization or shedding is expected) are selected and target specimens are tested by PCR. This two-methodology approach provides very convincing evidence of infection. Moreover, although PCR cannot distinguish between live and dead organisms, results from PCR testing can provide valuable information about the current status (actively shedding, free of colonization) among individual animals or groups of animals. The use of exhaust air debris environmental samples as an alternative/adjunct to sentinel and direct experimental animal sampling has been studied primarily for health monitoring of mice. These studies demonstrated that PCR testing of exhaust air debris environmental samples from racks with unfiltered exhaust air flow reliably detected the presence of fur mites, pinworms, Helicobacter spp., R. pneumotropicus, and protozoa (Bauer et al., 2016, Brielmeier et al., 2006, Jensen et al., 2013, Kapoor et al., 2017, Manuel et al., 2017, Miller et al., 2016, Zorn et al., 2017, Compton et al., 2004). While it is tempting to extrapolate these findings, further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of variables such as rack type, air flow, bedding type, and prevalence of infection on sample reliability specifically for rats.",

For ectoparasites, the pelage can be collected and examined for mite or louse infestation. Most protocols suggest allowing the sample to cool to encourage mites to venture to the tips of the hair shaft in search of a warmer host. Alternatively, Scotch tape tests may be effective for detecting mites or mite eggs attached to hair shafts. The latter can also be utilized in the live animal.",

Detection of helminths in gross specimens may be enhanced by the use of a dissecting microscope. Incubation of a section of intestine in saline for a short period of time may also facilitate detection by allowing worms to migrate out of the dark fecal matter into the more transparent saline. Pinworms of the genera S. muris also deposit ova on the perineum and can thus be detected by perineal tape testing. For this test, a piece of clear cellophane tape is applied to the perineal skin, placed on a microscope slide, and examined for typical banana-shaped ova. This test offers the advantage of being usable in live animals. As an alternative, fecal flotation may be used to detect pinworm or cestode ova.",

Microscopic and gross examinations for parasites are advantageous in that they are relatively simple, straightforward techniques; some (tape tests, fecal flotation) can be performed on live animals and they are relatively specific. The disadvantage of these tests is that they lack sensitivity for detection of light to moderate infection and are thus quickly being replaced by more sensitive PCR (Jackson et al., 2013, Gerwin et al., 2017). Indeed, some contemporary health-monitoring programs routinely employ PCR for parasite screening. Infectious agents that are not efficiently transmitted to sentinel rats via dirty bedding (e.g., endoparasites and fur mites) are more reliably detected in samples taken directly from colony rats. Optimal sample types include feces for the detection of endoparasites (e.g., Entamoeba sp., Giardia sp., pinworms, Rodentolepis sp.) and fur swabs or cage swabs for the detection of mites (e.g., Ornithonyssus bacoti and Radfordia ensifera). PCR testing of large numbers of samples is costly. To offset the cost, individual samples are routinely pooled. PCR offers exquisite sensitivity, detecting as few as 1\u201310 template copies (Compton and Riley, 2001); therefore individual samples may be pooled in groups of \u226410 with little concern for loss of diagnostic sensitivity.",

These profiles almost invariably include serologic examination for antibodies to viral and bacterial agents and may include gross necropsy examination, parasite examination, examination for enteric or respiratory pathogens using culture or molecular techniques, and histologic examination of target tissues. The design of these testing profiles requires consideration of several factors as outlined in earlier sections of this chapter. Tiered testing strategies are very economical and are becoming commonplace (Laber-Laird and Proctor, 1993). With these strategies, the most prevalent agents are tested for on a frequent basis via inexpensive high-throughput tests, while testing for agents of low prevalence or screening of animals for indication of emerging diseases occurs on a less frequent basis. For example, rats may be screened for endoparasites, ectoparasites, C. piliforme, Helicobacter spp., M. pulmonis, R. pneumotropicus, R. heylii, R. ratti, parvoviruses, PVM, RTV/Boone cardiovirus, and RCV/SDAV on a quarterly basis, whereas less prevalent agents such as Corynebacterium kutscheri, F. rodentium, S. moniliformis, adenovirus, LCMV, reovirus, Sendai virus, and Seoul virus are tested for once a year (Nicklas et al., 2002, Mahler et al., 2014, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009).",

            "text": "There are several approaches to test interpretation. First, results should be interpreted in the context of the entire colony and the health monitoring program. Decisions about rodent health should rarely if ever be made on a single positive result and the latter should be assumed to be a false positive until verified (Laber-Laird and Proctor, 1993, Compton and Riley, 2001, Livingston and Riley, 2003). Verification may include testing a sample (serum) using an alternative test platform, testing a second sample from the affected animals using an alternative test platform (for example, through PCR), or testing cohort animals (Livingston and Riley, 2003, Weisbroth et al., 1998). As discussed earlier, there are three primary serologic testing platforms: ELISA, MFI, and IFA. These platforms can also be used as adjuncts for each other. In most diagnostic laboratories, the MFI and/or ELISA serves as the primary serological test, and borderline or solitary positive results are confirmed by IFA. Confirmatory testing may also involve the use of different testing platforms. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for F. rodentium, the lungs may be tested by PCR or examined with a silver stain to detect the presence of the organism. Often, only serum is collected for health monitoring, so samples for confirmatory testing by other platforms may not be possible. In these cases, testing of cohort animals may be warranted and a diagnostic plan to test with different testing platforms should be designed. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for a rat parvovirus, additional animals from that colony may be tested by serology and their mesenteric lymph nodes may concurrently be tested by PCR for rat parvovirus. Testing of cohort animals is also warranted in the case where very few animals are seropositive. This scenario may indicate an early outbreak or a false-positive result. If an early outbreak is occurring, cohort animals will have additional time to seroconvert and the percentage of positives should increase.",

            "text": "As discussed earlier, when laboratory testing suggests a change in colony status for a particular agent, it is important to verify the information. Once confidence in the initial lab result is obtained, the positive sample should be tracked back to confirm its origin by comparing the date of testing, or cage or animal identification numbers, etc., to the monitoring schedule and sampling documentation. Based on this information, if an excluded agent appears to be present, the room should be quarantined to prevent further spread throughout the facility while the situation is being further assessed. Scheduled incoming shipments should be diverted to other areas and transfers out of the room should be canceled or approved only after specific risk assessment of where the animals are to be taken and for what purpose. Changes to standard practices that have the potential to affect cross-contamination should be considered, such as the room entry order, the handling and transport of soiled cages, the protective clothing and disinfectants used in the room, and the amount of personnel traffic allowed. A follow-up plan should be implemented to establish whether the agent truly does exist within the room by performing additional confirmatory testing on remaining sentinels or principal animals. It may be useful to draft a generic initial response plan for suspected contamination events in advance, so that these initial steps can be instituted promptly and efficiently.",

It is also prudent to include key individuals from the administration or upper management (since there may be a significant fiscal impact) and the institutional animal care and use committee. In some cases, there will be no question what the follow-up response to contamination will be (for example, eradication of the agent), but in others the potential costs and benefits of the available options may need to be considered. Regardless of the decisions made, the plan must be documented and distributed so that the goal is very clear to all involved and the sequence of events and projected timeline are evident.",

            "text": "There are a variety of methods that can be used to eliminate an infectious agent from an area, and careful professional judgment is needed to determine the most appropriate course of action. If the animals are replaceable and the primary consideration is to return the room to normal use, complete depopulation followed by environmental decontamination can be performed. Attempting partial depopulation by removing positive animals (via test and cull) may not be the most productive approach for many rodent colony disease outbreaks due to the large numbers of animals often involved, the delay between exposure and seroconversion (although PCR testing can be used to minimize that concern), and the possibility that the disease will be further spread during the handling and sampling procedures needed to test the entire population. As an alternative approach, if the agent does not establish persistent infection, it may be useful to test and remove the negative animals. Fully immune populations should pose little risk of shedding to na\u00efve animals after infection by agents such as coronavirus or Sendai virus. By retaining only previously exposed seropositive animals to reestablish a breeding program, it is possible to produce seronegative offspring (Brammer et al., 1993). A related approach to break the chain of transmission and repopulate an area without determining the serologic status of each individual rat allowed to remain is the cessation of breeding method, also known as burnout or stop-breeding schemes. By eliminating the introduction of na\u00efve animals from outside and eliminating all internal breeding for a period of time (6\u20138 weeks is recommended), coronavirus can be eliminated from a population (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985, Jacoby and Gaertner, 1994). Reciprocal transfer of soiled bedding between all cages during the early weeks of a burnout period is an optional step that theoretically can help assure that all animals have had equivalent exposure to the agent. Of note, these techniques may not work in immunodeficient rats and should be used with caution in genetically engineered rats.",
