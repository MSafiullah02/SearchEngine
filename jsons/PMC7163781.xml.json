            "text": "Protected areas are geographic areas set aside and managed for conservation of nature, ecosystem services and cultural values (IUCN, 1994). They are a key tool used to conserve biodiversity and are central to virtually all national and international conservation efforts (Gaston et al., 2008). The successful contribution of protected areas to biodiversity conservation is globally recognized, and every year billions of U.S. dollars are spent to maintain, improve and develop protected areas (Balmford, Gaston, Blyth, James, & Kapos, 2003). In 2011, there were approximately 160,000 protected areas worldwide, covering an estimated 12% of the earth's land surface (IUCN, 2011). One of the Aichi targets specifically aims to increase this to 17% by 2020 (United Nations, 2013), testament to protected areas' perceived importance for conservation of the world's biodiversity.",

            "text": "Most protected areas are developed and maintained to conserve particular species or habitats. For example, the Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa was designed to conserve elephants (Swemmer & Taljaard, 2011), or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia was designed to protect corals and associated marine communities (GBRMPA, 2009). A substantial body of work examining the effect of protected areas on biodiversity confirms that these parks are effective at conserving the target species or habitat (Geldmann et al., 2013; Owen\u2010Smith, Kerley, Page, Slotow, & van Aarde, 2006; Watson et al., 2011). However, it is not clear whether protected areas are generally also effective at protecting non\u2010target species. Despite some keystone species or focal habitats benefiting within large, national protected areas, some of the remaining biodiversity may decline (Craigie et al., 2010; Hoekstra, Clark, Fagan, & Boersma, 2002; Watson, Dudley, Segan, & Hockings, 2014). For example, the Maasai Mara National Reserve is a wildlife sanctuary situated in the south of Kenya and was inaugurated in 1961. Its primary conservation goals include conserving mammalian wildlife, specifically, endangered carnivores. This goal has largely been achieved as lion densities have remained high since the onset of conservation programmes (Ogutu & Dublin, 2002), although other non\u2010target species have declined in density, such as wildebeest (Newmark, 2008; Ottichilo, De Leeuw, & Prins, 2001), vultures (Virani, Kendall, Njoroge, & Thomsett, 2011) and ungulates (Ogutu, Owen\u2010Smith, Piepho, & Said, 2011). Thus, managing an area for protection of one group or species does not necessarily protect all wildlife species, nor does it ensure the presence of specific species or taxa (van Jaarsveld et al., 1998). This suggests that there are still critical gaps in knowledge of how effective protected areas are at protecting biodiversity in general.",

            "text": "In this study, we use bird abundances to explore the broadscale ecological effectiveness of protected areas on avian biodiversity. Birds are good group to study because they are easily monitored, widespread, well\u2010studied and occupy many niches (Furness & Greenwood, 1993). Furthermore, they are mobile and easily travel between areas with different land uses, which should allow them to react more quickly to changes in habitat quality. We consider common, resident bird species over the study area. Common species tend to be abundant, widespread, and in general, drive patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functionalities such as community assemblages, species richness, primary productivity and nutrient cycling (Gaston & Fuller, 2008; Lennon, Beale, Reid, Kent, & Pakeman, 2011; Winfree, Fox, Williams, Reilly, & Cariveau, 2015). Even slight declines in common species can have disproportionately negative effects on ecosystem functioning and indicate significant losses of ecosystem health (Gaston, 2010; Winfree et al., 2015). Therefore, monitoring how well common species fare in protected areas can give insight into the ecological health of protected areas. Here, we examine how the abundance of common species is affected by protected areas. If protected areas are beneficial for avian biodiversity in general, we expect higher bird abundances within protected areas relative to non\u2010protected areas.",

Gauteng is the most densely populated province in South Africa with average human density of 675.1 people per km2 (Statistics South Africa, 2012). This ensures the study area was well atlassed, and that our data were of sufficient volume for our analyses (see below) and accurately represented the bird community. The study area covered approximately 35,000 km2, of which 6.4% (approximately 2,240 km2) is protected (South African National Biodiversity Institute, 2009), either privately or publicly. The proportion of protected areas per pentad ranges from 0 to 1. The study area incorporates 81 protected areas, ranging in size from 0.08 km2 to 816.70 km2, at an average of 27.65 km2.

This is especially true for birds because they are a very mobile species and can travel easily between multiple land uses within a landscape. Our study primarily comprised of protected areas, urban and agricultural land use types. The level of protection provided by protected areas to a species may depend on the degree to which the species is able to adapt to neighbouring land use types (or, to habitats disturbed due to human\u2010related activity). Group 1 includes many species recorded to adapt poorly to disturbed habitats (including human\u2010modified landscapes), or are habitat specialists (Chace & Walsh, 2006; Greve et al., 2011; Rayner, Lindenmayer, Wood, Gibbons, & Manning, 2014; Santos, Pino, Rod\u00e0, Guirado, & Ribas, 2008; Thomas et al., 2012). Thus, for these species, protected areas play an important conservation role, as they provide natural and undisturbed habitat in which they may persist. For example, in our case, these include ground\u2010feeder species such as cape rock thrush (Monticola rupestris,\n\u03b2^1 = 4.23), sentinel rock thrush (Monticola exploratory, \u03b2^1 = 3.56), plain\u2010backed pipit (Anthus leucophrys, \u03b2^1 = 2.13); vegivores including the cape bunting (Emberiza capensis, \u03b2^1 = 2.40) and red\u2010winged francolin (Scleroptila levaillantii, \u03b2^1 = 2.21); predators including African grass owl (Tyto capensis, \u03b2^1 = 2.02), jackal buzzard (Buteo rufofuscus, \u03b2^1 = 1.96), rock kestrel (Falco rupicolus, \u03b2^1 = 1.82); hawkers including rock martin (Ptyonoprogne fuligula, \u03b2^1 = 0.87), fiery\u2010necked nightjar (Caprimulgus pectoralis, \u03b2^1 = 0.81); and finally, frugivores including yellow\u2010fronted tinkerbird (Pogoniulus chrysoconus, \u03b2^1 = 1.11) and dark\u2010capped bulbul (Pycnonotus tricolor, \u03b2^1 = 0.61). Generally, our results indicate that protected areas play an important role to the persistence of many species within group 1.",

            "text": "Conversely, granivores were more abundant in pentads with lower proportions of protected areas (group 3, Table 1). Granivores can be opportunistic, adapt quickly to new environments (Beissinger & Osborne, 1982; Chace & Walsh, 2006) and benefit from additional food sources and variety of nesting and roosting spots available in urban and agricultural land use types (Chace & Walsh, 2006; Gaston & Evans, 2004). Thus, our study suggests granivores favoured the conditions offered in urban and agricultural land use types over those provided by protected areas. Indeed, granivores with the most negative \u03b2^1 included the village indigobird (Vidua chalybeate, \u03b2^1 = \u22122.63), scaly\u2010feathered finch (Sporopipes squamifrons, \u03b2^1 = \u22121.93), red\u2010headed finch (Amadina erythrocephala, \u03b2^1 = \u22121.86) and red\u2010capped lark (Calandrella cinereal, \u03b2^1 = \u22121.55), all of which have been shown to adapt well to agricultural land use types in South Africa (Barnard, 1997; Dean, 1997; Herremans, 1997a, 1997b). Gleaners, on the other hand, were on average as abundant within pentads with a high proportion of protected areas as they were in those with low proportions (group 2, Table 1). This is probably because gleaners may eat insects that are attracted into urban gardens (Chace & Walsh, 2006). For example, species in this group such as the black\u2010chested prinia (Prinia flavicans, \u03b2^1 = \u22121.27), grey\u2010headed bush shrike (Malaconotus blanchoti, \u03b2^1 = 0.55), tawny\u2010flanked prinia (Prinia subflava, \u03b2^1 = 0.49) and southern boubou (Laniarius ferrugineus, \u03b2^1 = 0.89) are commonly observed in gardens of suburban areas (Berruti, 1997a, 1997b; Parker, 1997a, 1997b). Furthermore, in some cases, agricultural practices may increase the abundance and species richness of insects (although this depends on the intensity of farming, and the type of crop planted; Benton, Bryant, Cole, & Crick, 2002; Newton, 2004), which may support relatively dense populations of gleaning species in agricultural lands. Thus, the ecological benefit provided by protected areas to gleaning species appears to depend strongly on the land use types surrounding protected areas.",

An alternative explanation for our findings could be that protected areas were in areas that can naturally sustain high abundances of birds, for example, if they were located in areas with higher productivity. However, productivity is less likely to have a direct influence on our findings as protected areas are generally placed in areas of low economic value and in unwanted space, and productivity is not a major factor in the establishment of protected areas (Joppa & Pfaff, 2009). Furthermore, our study consisted of 81 protected areas of varying sizes, scattered over the landscape matrix (as opposed to just one, large protected area), and we accounted for vegetation as one of the most important drivers of avian diversity in our area.",

The next step in further understanding the role played by protected areas is to gain insight into the mechanisms by which they are able to sustain higher abundances of common species. This can be done by examining local colonization and extinction dynamics using dynamic occupancy models. As we suggest here, land use types neighbouring protected areas may affect significantly the conservation performance of protected areas. A further consideration, then, is to understand carefully the ways in which neighbouring land use types affect the ability of protected areas to host large abundances of common species. Additionally, the conservation performance of protected areas can be significantly affected by management practices. Future studies should quantify how differences in management influence performance. Tackling these concepts will considerably increase our general understanding of the conservation role played by protected areas, and the value they provide to biodiversity.",
