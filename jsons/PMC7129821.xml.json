All age groups are affected by influenza infection, but serious complications occur much more frequently in young children (<1-year-old) and the elderly (>65 years old), (Sczucs, 1999). In young children, influenza infection leads to significantly increased antibiotic prescription, outpatient visits and hospitalisation (Neuzil et al., 2000), while elderly nursing home patients with culture proven influenza A or B infection show significantly increased mortality (Drinka et al., 1999). Other at risk groups also suffer considerable morbidity and significant mortality (Neuzil et al., 1999, Nicholson, 1996).",

Rapid diagnosis of influenza will be required to enable early treatment. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a more sensitive and specific method for the detection of influenza infection than virus isolation or direct immunofluorescence and can be used for rapid diagnosis (Magnard et al., 1999, Pregliasco et al., 1998, Stockton et al., 1998, Wallace et al., 1999). Our data (unpublished) demonstrate that RT-PCR can detect up to twice as many influenza positive samples than virus culture and direct immunofluorescence combined. Multiplex PCR has been used to monitor the influenza outbreak in England and Wales (Ellis et al., 1997). As respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was shown to be a significant cause of influenza-like illness (ILI), in a wide age range of patients, during the winter respiratory season (Zambon et al., 2001), it is therefore essential to make a virological diagnosis to effect appropriate treatment.",

RNA was extracted from samples using an adapted protocol for the High Pure Viral RNA Extraction Kit\u2122 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany); 400 \u03bcl of the VPSS sample was loaded directly onto the spin-column and then the manufacturer\u2019s instructions were followed. RNA was eluted in a volume of 50 \u03bcl. cDNA was synthesised by reverse-transcription as previously described (Wallace et al., 1999). Nested PCR was performed using primers which amplified regions within the genes for: (i) the influenza A matrix protein (Zhang and Evans, 1991); (ii) the influenza B haemagglutinin (Stockton et al., 1998); (iii) the N and P regions of the RSV genome (Stockton et al., 1998) and the FI subunit of fusion F glycoprotein (Henkel et al., 1997); (iv) the picornavirus 5\u2032NCR (Andeweg et al., 1999). TaqStart\u2122 antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) was used to increase sensitivity and product specificity in both rounds of PCR (Wallace et al., 1999). cDNA (20 \u03bcl) was amplified in a reaction volume of 100 \u03bcl containing each of the four primer pairs at 5 pmol/\u03bcl and 3.5 mM MgCl2. PCR was performed in thin walled 0.2 ml tubes on a PE9700 thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). After an initial denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C, 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 45 s were followed by a final extension of 2 min at 72 \u00b0C. The second round of amplification was performed using an increased annealing temperature of 60 \u00b0C with nested primers (at 25 pmol/\u03bcl) in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl containing 2 \u03bcl of first round product. PCR products were analysed on 2% (3:1 Nusieve\u00ae agarose, FMC Bioproducts, USA) gels containing 0.2 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide. Product sizes of 767, 401, 334, 290 and 183 bp were expected for influenza B, influenza A, RSV A, picornavirus and RSV B, respectively.",

This is especially important when there is circulation of a non-vaccine strain in the community which adds extra burden to health care providers. Also, additional information on the cause of illness is available when multiplex PCR is performed; picornavirus infection was identified as the cause of around 4% of influenza-like illness over the season. A proportion of patients presenting with ILI do not have an influenza infection; 15% of patients were influenza A PCR negative even at the height of the influenza season. In a community-based study, Zambon et al. (2001) have shown that RSV is an important cause of ILI in all age groups, however this was not found in the sample group in this study. PCR assays are being developed for other respiratory pathogens, including parainfluenza, coronavirus, including the virus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, Drosten et al., 2003), human metapneumovirus (van den Hoogen et al., 2001), Mycoplasma and Chlamydia species, to assess the contribution of these agents to community influenza-like illness.",
