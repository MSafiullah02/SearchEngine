The burden of TB is alarmingly high in developing countries, where diagnosis latent TB infection (LTBI), Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), HIV-associated TB, and paediatric TB is still a challenge. This is mainly due to delayed or misdiagnosis of TB, which continues to fuel its worldwide epidemic. The ideal diagnostic test is still unavailable, and conventional methods remain a necessity for TB diagnosis, though with poor diagnostic ability. The nanoparticles have shown potential for the improvement of drug delivery, reducing treatment frequency and diagnosis of various diseases. The engineering of antigens/antibody nanocarriers represents an exciting front in the field of diagnostics, potentially flagging the way toward development of better diagnostics for TB. This chapter discusses the presently available tests for TB diagnostics and also highlights the recent advancement in the nanotechnology-based detection tests for M. tuberculosis.",

The situation becomes critical by the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) forms of M. tuberculosis, that is, resistance to both isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) and now, extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains, that is, MDR TB strains plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable secondline drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) that is virtually untreatable (CDC 2006) . It has been estimated that almost billions of peoples will be newly affected with TB between 2000 and 2020. WHO estimated 10.4 million new cases and more than 1.3 million deaths in 2016 (WHO 2017) . Among the estimated 10.4 million incident cases, 10% were children and 35% were female. In 2016, 153,119 cases of multidrug-resistant TB and rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) globally (WHO 2017) . Most of the TB cases reported in 2016 occurred in Asia (56%) and the African Region (29%). The smaller proportions of cases were reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (8%), European Region (4%), and the Region of the Americas (3%).",

However, it requires longer duration to obtain the results and also specific laboratory facilities, which may be unreachable by resource-limited or poor countries. Immunological approaches, such as the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and IFN-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) have been developed for the detection of TB/latent TB infection (LTBI) (Lagrange et al. 2013 (Lagrange et al. , 2014 Pai et al. 2004 ).

First, M. tuberculosis is a slow-growing bacterium, and therefore it cannot provide direction for on-site patient care. Second, the PTB patient do not develop symptoms at the early stage of infection, which lead to delays in seeking patient care (Parsons et al. 2011; Kritski et al. 2013) . Third, even the active PTB cases often exhibit low bacteria count of sputum thus making it difficult to detect with smear microscopy and other commonly used POC diagnostic tests in the developing world. Fourth, use of sputum and other invasive body fluids in the diagnosis (2008) A. K. Gupta et al. of TB with existing techniques is more complex compared to blood and urine samples . The unavailability of accurate and validated biomarkers (for Active TB and LTBI infection) either derived from host or pathogen are due to inadequate knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction, pathogenesis, and protected immune response generated by M. tuberculosis during infection, which limited utility of rapid diagnostic test of TB (Goletti et al. 2016) .",

The nanoscale size and high surface-tovolume ratio of nanoparticles makes this field superior and indispensable in multifield of human action. The unique properties of nanomaterials or nanostructures deliberate the nanodiagnostic platforms and ability of rapid detection by utilizing very small volumes of clinical samples (Jackson et al. 2017) . The technology itself is variegated, and several options are available, for instance, nanosuspensions, nanoemulsions, niosomes (nonionic surfactant-based vesicles). Therefore, nanodiagnostic approaches have strong potential to be cost-effective, user-friendly, and robust (Azzazy et al. 2006; Kumar et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2017 ). The significant progress has been made in the field of nanotechnology in the last two decade, which showed its wide potential and advantageous applications in the field of biomedicine, biotechnology, human and animal health including nanodiagnostics and nanomedicines. Majority of the nanodiagnostic work has been carried out in the field of cancer diagnostics, but this technique has also been contributed significantly to the diagnosis of various infectious diseases presently (Kumar et al. 2011; Yukuyama et al. 2017 ). Most of the infectious disease-causing agents such as bacteria (M. tuberculosis), virus (SARS), and fungi may sometimes cause an epidemic outbreak, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality (Mathuria 2009; Nasiruddin et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018) . Thus, initiation of nano-based diagnostic platforms in a clinical setting is gaining importance these days. This is because of the ability of nanodiagnostics to achieve consistency, quick conclusions with simple and movable devices by using various body fluids, such as blood, sputum, or urine samples from patients (Banyal et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2017) .",

The optical property of AuNPs with antibody or antigen and other biomolecules enable their utility in the diagnosis of various pathogens. Moreover, AuNPs do not disturb the functional activity even after antigen immobilization (Choi and Frangioni 2010; Sonawane and Nimse 2016) . The antibody-antigen reaction is enhanced by the surface functionalization of gold nanoparticles, thereby increasing immunoassay signals, which ultimately increase the test sensitivity (Kim et al. 2018) . It offers an easy, low-cost assay, which allows simultaneously numerous sample testing. The assay has been found to be very specific and produce reliable results even with tiny amount of mycobacterial DNA. The colorimetric detection of target gene/sequence from test DNA samples via AuNP probes (thiol-linked single-stranded DNA, or ssDNA, modified gold nanoparticles) offer a low-cost alternative method for detection (Chandra et al. 2010; Cordeiro et al. 2016) .",

Principally, at wavelength 526 nm, if the complementary DNA is present, the nanoprobe solution remains pink in colour (no DNA probe aggregation), while the solution turns purple (due to nanoprobe aggregation at a high NaCl concentration) in the absence of complementary DNA in the samples. The method is more accurate when compared to other diagnostic methods, that is, InnoLiPA-Rif-TB, which gave 100% concordance (Baptista et al. 2008) . The test was proved to be more sensitive than smear microscopy and can be simply visualized for detection. The major advantage of this method is that the chances of contamination is very less (carried out in a single tube reducing contamination), rapid (takes approximately 15 min per sample).",

The method is based on the real-time monitoring of changes happening in the surface refractive index, formed by association or dissociation of the molecules from the sensor (Khan et al. 2019 ). The major advantage of the SPR-based test is its optical sensor sensitivity making it capable of detecting even tiny amount of disease-specific analyte from the complex fluid without any specific procedure (Masson 2017; Nguyen et al. 2015; Wang and Fan 2016) . Due to these advantages, SPR has emerged as a powerful optical tool, which can provide valuable data in the analysis of biomedical and chemical analyses. The SPR-based CFP-10 antigen detection system was developed in clinical samples by Yang et al. (2014) , which showed reputable usefulness in TB diagnostics (Hsieh et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014) . Zhu et al. (2017) developed AuNPs modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode for the direct detection of M. tuberculosis using genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated directly from clinical samples. The method utilized two probes: capture probe and gold nanoprobe coupled with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme as detection probe. First, ITO probe is activated via capture probe, then activated probe is immersed in the gDNA containing hybridization buffer to form double strand DNA (dsDNA) via hybridization of probe and target nucleotide sequence. Finally, ITO is placed as electrode in the buffer containing detection probe to generate hybridization sandwich. The electric signals are then recorded using voltametry (Zhu et al. 2017 ).",

Also, it can identify multiple targets at the same time, which makes it a much sought after application in the identification of various pathogens in single clinical samples (Rizvi et al. 2010) . The hybrid detection system (Quantum dots and magnetic beads) uses M. tuberculosis-specific molecular probes for TB detection. One probe binds to the 23S rRNA gene of the mycobacterium very precisely and the second probe precisely recognizes IS900 conserved sequence in mycobacterium, which was treated on sulphurous acid chromium quantum dots. Subsequently, sandwich is formed after hybridization with target gene sequences of mycobacterium DNA, isolated from suspected samples of TB patients. Then, quantum dot-magnetic bead conjugates are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, which emits red fluorescence (visible to the naked eye).",
