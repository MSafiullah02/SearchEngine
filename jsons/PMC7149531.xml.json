Others have defined it more specifically as the study of diseases that may be transmitted via the respiratory route (Dimmic and Akers, 1969). Despite the variations in definition, this evolving area is becoming increasingly important in many aspects of diverse fields including public health, environmental science, industrial and agricultural engineering, biological warfare and space exploration.",

Bioaerosols in general range from 0.02 to 100 \u03bcm in diameter and are classified on the basis of their size. The smaller particles (<0.1 \u03bcm in diameter) are considered to be in the nuclei mode, those ranging from 0.1 to 2 \u03bcm are in the accumulation mode and larger particles are considered to be in the coarse mode (Committee on Particulate Control Technology, 1980). As shown in Figure 5.2\n, particles in nuclei or accumulation mode are considered to be fine particles and those in coarse mode are considered coarse particles.Information Box 5.2Possible Modes of Respiratory Transmission of Influenza ADirect ContactTransmission occurs when the transfer of microorganism results from direct physical contact between an infected or colonized individual and a susceptible host.Indirect ContactTransmission occurs by the passive transfer of microorganisms to a susceptible host via inanimate contaminated object or fomite.DropletTransmission occurs via large droplets (\u22655 \u03bcm diameter) generated from the respiratory tract of the infected individual during coughing or sneezing, talking or during procedures such as suctioning or bronchoscopy. These droplets are propelled a distance of less than 1 m through the air, and are deposited on the nasal or oral mucosa of the new host or in their immediate environment. These large droplets do not remain suspended in the air and true aerosolization does not occur.AirborneTransmission occurs via the dissemination of microorganisms by aerosolization. Organisms are contained in droplet nuclei (airborne particles less than 5 \u03bcm that result from the evaporation of large droplets), or in dust particles containing skin cells and other debris that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. Microorganisms are widely dispersed by air currents and inhaled by susceptible hosts.See also Section 5.6.2 and Case Study 5.2.\n",

This information is derived from particle size analysis experiments, which indicate that the average diameter of airborne bacterial particles is greater than 5 \u03bcm (Fengxiang et al., 1992).

Transport of bioaerosols can be defined in terms of time and distance. Submicroscale transport involves short periods of time, under 10 minutes, as well as relatively short distances, under 100 m. This type of transport is common within buildings or other confined spaces. Microscale transport ranges from 10 minutes to 1 hour, and from 100 m to 1 km, and is the most common type of transport phenomenon. Mesoscale transport refers to transport in terms of days and distances up to 100 km, and in macroscale transport, the time and distances are extended even further. Because most microorganisms have limited ability to survive when suspended in the atmosphere, the most common scales considered are the submicroscale and microscale.

Diffusion is the scattering and/or dissipation of bioaerosols in response to a concentration gradient as well as gravity, and is generally aided by airflow and atmospheric turbulence. The amount of turbulence associated with airflow, and thus the relative amount of diffusion that may occur in association with particulates such as bioaerosols, can be estimated using the method of Osbert Reynolds. Reynolds found that factors associated with mean wind velocity, the kinetic viscosity of the air and the relative dimension of the interfering structures could provide an indication of the amount of turbulence associated with linear airflow. Without turbulence, airborne particles from a point source would travel in a concentrated stream directly downwind.

What does this mean? For an instantaneous point source under the influence of a mean wind direction, spread would be a standard spatial deviation from a linear axis (x) extending from the source (origin) in the mean direction of wind flow, with diffusion caused by turbulence occurring in the lateral (y) and vertical (z) axes (Figure 5.4). The standard deviation of particulate diffusion cannot be considered constant over a particular spatial orientation, but is instead dependent on the time taken to reach the particular distance. Mathematical models that attempt to estimate the transport of airborne particles use this basic premise as a foundation for predictions. To picture this concept, imagine standing at the door of a room, where someone is holding a smoking candle. If there is no air current in the room the smoke will still eventually reach you at the door, but it will be very diffuse as it is also spreading in every other direction. However, if there is a fan behind the person holding the smoking candle and this fan is pointed at the door, then the smoke from the candle will be carried by this air current. It will travel the same distance as it did before, but it will travel faster, undergo less diffusion and as a result be more concentrated when it reaches you. This is the principle of time-dependent diffusion as indicated by Tayler\u2019s theory.",

Rainfall deposition occurs as a condensation reaction between two particles (raindrop and bioaerosol), which combine and create a bioaerosol with a greater mass, which settles faster. This can be described mathematically using the Stokes equation. In the example presented in Information Box 5.1, a clostridial spore alone has a calculated terminal velocity of 0.016 cm/sec. The same spore (bioaerosol), if it condensed with another particle such as a water droplet, has a greater mass and thus a greater terminal velocity. For instance, if the clostridial spore were to condense with a water droplet that doubled the bioaerosol density from 1.3 to 2.6 g/cm3, the terminal velocity would be increased from 0.016 to 0.032 cm/sec. The overall efficiency of rain deposition also depends on the spread area of the particle plume. Larger, more diffuse plumes undergo stronger impaction than smaller, more concentrated plumes. Rain deposition is also affected by the intensity of the rainfall. The heavier the rainfall, the greater the overall rates and numbers of the condensation reactions, and the greater the subsequent increase in rain deposition.",

Wells and Riley (1937) were among the first to show this phenomenon, indicating that as the relative humidity approaches 100%, the death rate of Escherichia coli increases. In general, it has been reported that most Gram-negative bacteria associated with aerosols tend to survive for longer periods at low to mid levels of relative humidities, with enhanced decay at relative humidities above 80% (Brooks et al., 2004). The opposite tends to be true for Gram-positive bacteria, which tend to remain viable longer in association with high relative humidities (Theunissen et al., 1993). Thus, the ability of a microorganism to remain viable in a bioaerosol is related to the organism\u2019s surface biochemistry. One mechanism that explains loss of viability in association with very low relative humidity is a structural change in the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane. As water is lost from the cell, the cell membrane bilayer changes from the typical crystalline structure to a gel phase. This structural phase transition affects cell surface protein configurations and ultimately results in inactivation of the cell (Hurst et al., 1997). In general, Gram-negative bacteria react unfavorably to desiccation, whereas Gram-positive cells are more tolerant of desiccation stress (Mohr, 2001).",

It is believed that the pandemic began in Haskell County, Kansas, before spreading rapidly to Europe. Estimates of the total number of deaths range from 50 to 100 million worldwide with 500,000 to 675,000 deaths in the U.S.A. (Barry, 2004).\n",

The abundance of culturable bacteria and fungi in clouds varies with the season, with greater numbers occurring in the summer and fall. While only 1% of the bacteria and 50% of the fungi in clouds are culturable, studies suggest that the majority are metabolically active (Delort et al., 2010). Bacterial numbers range from 103 to 104/ml compared to fungal numbers of 102 to 104/ml. The cloud environment is a harsh environment with UV light irradiation, desiccation, low temperatures and other factors potentially adversely affecting microbes (Figure 5.8\n).

Major pathogens of such crops are the wheat rust fungi. These spore-forming fungi cause some of the most devastating diseases of wheat and other grains. In 1993, one type of wheat rust (leaf rust) was responsible for the loss of over 40 million bushels of wheat in Kansas and Nebraska alone. Even with selective breeding for resistance in wheat plants, leaf rust continues to have major economic impacts. The high concentration of wheat in areas ranging from northern Texas to Minnesota and up into the Dakotas makes this whole region highly susceptible to rust epidemics.Information Box 5.3Examples of Airborne Plant Pathogens\n\nThe figure shows the airborne spread of late blight of potato that caused the 1845 epidemic known as the Irish potato famine.

The airborne spread of rust disease has been shown to follow a predictable trend, which starts during the fall with the planting of winter wheat in the southern plains. Any rust-infected plant produces thousands of spores, which are released into the air (Figure 5.9\n) by either natural atmospheric disturbance or mechanical disturbance during the harvesting process. Once airborne, these spores are capable of long-distance dispersal, which can cause downwind deposition onto other susceptible wheat plants. The generation time of new spores is measured in weeks, after which new spores are again released from vegetative fungi into the AMB pathway. For example, during the harvest of winter wheat in Texas, the prevailing wind currents are from south to north, which can allow rust epidemics to spread into the maturing crops farther north in Kansas and up into the young crops in the Dakotas (Figure 5.10\n). This epidemic spread of wheat rust and the resulting economic destruction produced are indicative of the impact that airborne microbial pathogens can have on agriculture.",

This is because many pesticides have long half-lives and their residence in an ecosystem can be extremely harmful. Therefore, instead of using wheat rust fungicides, attempts are being made to breed strains of wheat that are more resistant to the fungi. Another method used for controlling phytopathogenic (plant pathogenic) fungi is spore monitoring as a disease control strategy. In this approach, the life cycle of the fungi, especially the release of spores, is monitored, and fungicide application is timed to coincide with spore release. This approach minimizes use of harmful chemicals. Thus, efficient aeromicrobiology pathway sampling, monitoring, detection and modeling have the ability to aid in the control of airborne pathogens.",

The occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease is an example of the importance of bioaerosols in the spread of airborne disease (Case Study 5.3\n). It has long been thought that bioaerosol spread is linked primarily to respiratory pathogens, but there is growing evidence that gastrointestinal pathogens are also important in airborne transmission of disease among animals. One example of bioaerosol spread of a gastrointestinal pathogen is transmission of Salmonella typhimurium among calves that are housed individually in small pens (Hinton et al., 1983). The potential for bioaerosol spread of this pathogen was recognized because the initial symptoms resembled those of pneumonia and appeared randomly within these animals, two factors that are not characteristic of oral transmission. Oral transmission generally occurs sequentially from one pen to the next, whereas aerial transmission can carry organisms past nearby pens, infecting calves randomly. Furthermore, Wathes et al. (1988) showed that S. typhimurium could survive for long periods in an airborne state, and calves and mice exposed to aerosolized S. typhimurium developed symptoms, proving that gastrointestinal pathogens could be spread by aerosolization. Finally, Baskerville et al. (1992) showed that aerosolized Salmonella enteritidis could infect laying hens. These hens showed clinical symptoms and were shedding the test strain of salmonellae in their feces within a few days. Thus, the aeromicrobiology pathway can be important even in the spread of diseases for which pathogens are not normally considered airborne.Information Box 5.4Examples of Airborne Animal Pathogens\n\nCase Study 5.3The United Kingdom Foot and Mouth Crisis 2001Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease have occurred worldwide including multiple occurrences within the U.S.A.

The 2001 U.K. outbreak was due to a type O pan-Asia strain that was thought to have arisen from infected meat illegally imported into the U.K. Transmission of the virus can occur via direct contact or via bioaerosols (Grubman and Baxt, 2004).

            "text": "One of the primary methods for the disposal of biosolids and manure is agricultural land application. The major concern associated with the aerosolization process in relation to waste disposal operations is the exposure of waste disposal workers to pathogenic microorganisms (occupational risk). In addition, nearby population centers are also potential exposure risks (community risk). The potential for aerosolization of pathogens from land application of biosolids has become a nationally debated issue. A major national study on aerosolization from land application in the United States was conducted by Brooks et al., 2005a, Brooks et al., 2005b. This study showed that occupational risks of infection from bioaerosols was greater than for offsite communities, where risks were minimal (Brooks et al., 2012) (Case Study 5.4\n). Baertsch et al. (2007) used DNA-based microbial source tracking to measure aerosolization during land application.Case Study 5.4Occupational and Community Risks of Infection from Bioaerosols Generated During Land Application of BiosolidsIn 2002, the National Research Council (NRC) issued a report titled, Biosolids Applied to Land: Advancing Standards and Practices. One of the recommendations of this report was the need to document and evaluate the risk of infections from bioaerosols generated during land application. In response to this the University of Arizona conducted a national study to evaluate occupational and community risks from such bioaerosols. Overall, more than 1000 aerosol samples were collected and analyzed for bacterial and viral pathogens (Tanner et al., 2005; Brooks et al., 2005b).The study was undertaken in two parts. First, the emission rate of pathogens generated during loading of biosolids from trucks into spreaders, and also during land application of biosolids, was evaluated. This was assumed to be direct exposure to biosolid workers on-site, that is, occupational risk, since there was no pathogen transport required to for exposure. For community risk, fate and transport of pathogens was taken into account, since residents live off-site, allowing for natural attenuation of pathogens due to environmental factors such as desiccation and ultraviolet light.Based on exposure data gathered on-site during land application, occupational risk of infection from Coxsackie virus A21 was determined using a one-hit exponential model: Pi\n=1\u2212exp(\u2212rN), where:Pi\n=the probability of infection per work day,\nr\n=parameter defining the probability of an organism initiating infection=0.0253 for Coxsackie A21, and\nN=number of pathogens inhaled per day\nThe annual risk of infection can be calculated from the daily risk usingPyear=1\u2212(1\u2212Pi)dwhere d=number of days exposed per year.Occupational Risk of InfectionAnnual risk of infection for Coxsackie virus A21 during loading operations was 2.1\u00d710\u22122.This risk suggests that approximately 1 worker per 50 is likely to be infected with Coxsackie virus A11 working on-site over the course of 1 year.Community Risk of InfectionRisk was calculated for a distance of 30 m from a land application site assuming 6 days of land application annually, and 8 h exposure duration.Annual risk of infection for Coxsackie virus A21 during loading was 3.8\u00d710\u22125.Annual risk of infection for Coxsackie virus A21 during land application was 2.1\u00d710\u22125.These data imply that community risks of infection are minimal. As a comparison, for drinking water a 1:10,000 risk of infection per hear is considered acceptable (Haas et al., 2014).",

Due to the ubiquity of Gram-negative bacteria, especially in soil, LPS is considered by some to be the most important aerobiological allergen. LPS (Figure 5.15\n) has three major components: a lipid A moiety, which is a disaccharide of phosphorylated glucosamines with associated fatty acids; a core polysaccharide; and an O-side chain. The lipid A moiety and the core polysaccharide are similar among Gram-negative bacteria, but the O-side chain varies among species and even strains. It is the O-side chain that is responsible for the hyperallergenic reaction. There are many sources associated with the production of high levels of LPS, such as cotton mills, haystacks, sewage treatment plants, solid waste handling facilities, swine confinement buildings, poultry houses, and even homes and office buildings. LPS is liberated when Gram-negative bacteria in these environments are lysed but can also be released when they are actively growing.",

How can growth and spread of Legionella spp. be avoided? Several strategies can be used. In the maintenance of hot-water plumbing systems, operating temperatures should be greater than 50\u00b0C. All potential places where water can stagnate in water pipes should be avoided. For cooling towers, the recommendations involve the installation of ozonization units, dry convective heat exchange designs and the avoidance of any design that could potentially mix the wet system with the supply air.

Ventilation is considered one of the least effective methods for controlling airborne pathogens, but is still very important. Ventilation relies on mixing of intramural air with extramural air to reduce the concentration of airborne particles. However, in some cases the addition of extramural air can actually increase airborne particles. For example, one study showed that hospitals in Delhi, India, that relied on ventilation alone contained airborne fungal loads that were higher inside the hospital than those outside. This indicates that ventilation alone may not be sufficient to significantly reduce circulating bioaerosols.

Some filters, for example, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are reported to remove virtually all infectious particles. These types of filters are commonly used in biological safety hoods. However, because of their high cost, they are not often used in building filtration systems. Instead, other filtration systems that rely on baghouse filtration (a baghouse works on the same principle as a vacuum cleaner bag) are used. Typically, air filters (baghouse, HEPA, etc.) are rated using the dust-spot percentage, which is an index of the size of the particles efficiently removed by the filter, with higher percentages representing greater filtration efficiencies. The typical rating for the filters used in most buildings is 30 to 50%. Studies have shown that a 97% dust-spot rating is required to effectively remove virus particles from the air. Other factors that influence filtration efficiency are related to the type of circulation system and how well it mobilizes air within the building, the type of baghouse system used and the filter material chosen (nylon wound, spun fiberglass, etc.) as well as the filter\u2019s nominal porosity (1 \u03bcm\u20135 \u03bcm). All these factors combine to influence the efficiency of the air filtration and removal of particles including bioaerosols.

UVGI has been shown to be able to control many types of pathogens, although some microbes show various levels of resistance. The control of contagion using UV irradiation was tested in a tuberculosis (TB) ward of a hospital. Contaminated air was removed from the TB ward through a split ventilation duct and channeled into two animal holding pens that contained guinea pigs. One pen received air that had been treated with UV irradiation; the other received untreated air. The guinea pigs in the untreated-air compartment developed TB, but none of the animals in the UV-treated compartment became infected. The American Hospital Association (1974) indicated that, properly utilized, UV radiation can kill nearly all infectious agents, although the effect is highly dependent on the UV intensity and exposure time. Thus, major factors that affect survival (temperature, relative humidity, UV radiation, ozone) in the extramural environment can be used to control the spread of contagion in the intramural environment.",

Room air is also drawn into the cabinet through the top of the unit, where it joins the circulating air and passes through the HEPA filter and into the work area. About 70% of the air circulating in the work area is then removed by passing it through the rear grill of the cabinet, where it is discharged into the exhaust system. The remaining 30% is passed through the front grill, essentially recirculating in the cabinet (Figure 5.17). Laboratory personnel require special training in order to properly use Class II cabinets and to ensure proper containment of bioaerosols. One of the major hazards associated with Class II cabinets is the potential for the disruption of the negative airflow. Many mechanical actions can disrupt the protective airflow, such as repeated insertion and withdrawal of arms, opening or closing of doors in the laboratory, or even someone walking past the cabinet while it is in use. Any of these actions can potentially allow the escape of bioaerosols from the cabinet.",

Class III cabinets use complete isolation to protect workers. All air entering the cabinet is filtered using a HEPA filter, and the air leaving the cabinet is filtered by two HEPA filters in series. The exhaust may also include biocidal treatment such as incineration following the HEPA filtration to further ensure complete biological inactivation. In addition to these safeguards, Class III cabinets are connected with airtight seals to all other laboratory equipment (such as incubators, refrigerators and centrifuges) that is needed for working with the pathogens while using the cabinet.
