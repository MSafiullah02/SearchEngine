Nearly one-half of all children with pneumonia will develop parapneumonic effusions, but fewer than 5% of these effusions progress to empyema. However, the incidence of empyema complicating community-acquired pneumonia is increasing, which causes significant childhood morbidity (6). Progression of a pleural effusion to empyema is through a three-stage evolution: (1) exudative, (2) fibrinopurulent, and (3) organization. Most commonly pleural effusions do not progress beyond the exudative phase and resolve with antibiotics alone (4, 7). The second stage is heralded by the arrival of bacteria, by pleural invasion from the contiguous pneumonic process. Progression occurs with polymorph accumulation and fibrin deposition; membrane formation occurs and the developing empyema may become compartmentalized or loculated. The chemistry profile of pleural fluid is characterized by a decrease in pH and glucose concentrations and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDH). The most common organisms encountered in pleural fluid in children are S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes (1\u20135). If a fibropurulent pleural effusion is not adequately treated, then the third organizing phase develops. Fibroblasts grow into the exudate from the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces. An inelastic membrane is formed, which and may encase the lung and pleura, with the potential to restrict respiration. The thick exudate may drain spontaneously through the chest wall or into the lungs, causing a bronchopleural fistula. Other infectious complications of empyema include bacteremia and pericarditis by direct extension or bacteremic seeding, and pneumothorax.",

It is arbitrary to designate larger cavities by the term lung abscesses and smaller, multiple cavities with similar histology by the term necrotizing pneumonia. Necrotizing pneumonia is an acute fulminating infection of the lung parenchyma, characterized by vascular thrombosis and rapid tissue breakdown leading to multiple thin-walled cavities. Pulmonary abscess is a more chronic thick-walled cavity in the lung, usually encountered in patients with chronic debilitating states. Anaerobic bacteria and S. aureus are most frequently implicated with the formation of a lung abscess. Complications of lung abscess include rupture into adjacent compartments, which occurs more frequently with S. aureus. Localized bronchiectasis may also occur as a complication.",

In the United States, 20 million hospitalizations in the pediatric population occur, although many are of viral etiology (8). Each year in the developed nations, 5\u201310% of children under the age of 5 years will develop pneumonia (5). The incidence of pneumonia in children is approximately 34\u201340 per 1,000 (9). Approximately one-half of children younger than 5 years with community-acquired pneumonia require hospitalization (10). Complicated pneumonia such as necrotizing pneumonia and abscess formation has been noted to increase in incidence over the years between 1990 and 2005 (11, 12). Parapneumonic effusions complicate pneumonia between 36 and 56% of cases with an incidence between 0.4 and 0.6 per 1,000 cases (13). Empyema complicates an estimated 0.6% of all childhood pneumonias, resulting in an incidence of 3.3 per 100,000 children (6). Unlike in the adult population, most pediatric patients recover without mortality whereas in adults, the mortality rate has been reported to be up to 20% (6, 11). There has been an emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in pediatric pneumonia, originally thought to be mainly hospital acquired (14). An aggressive infection, MRSA pneumonia, has been reported to present with high fever, leukopenia, rapidly progressing respiratory distress, development of multilobar infiltrates with effusions, and empyema (15, 16). Intravenous antibiotics are first-line therapy and surgical treatment may be needed in patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema (15).",

Virkki et al. performed a study in 254 children admitted with diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia to evaluate the role of chest radiography, total white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (30). They found that 71% of children with lobar opacities demonstrate laboratory evidence of a bacterial infection, but interstitial opacities were seen with approximately equal frequencies in viral and bacterial pneumonias. Of children less than 2 years, 38% had bacterial infections and 60% viral, whereas in older children bacterial pneumonias were more prevalent (49%) than viral (22%), the remainder being of mixed etiology. Likewise, Korppi et al. performed a study of 61 children treated for radiologically and microbiologically confirmed viral or bacterial pneumonia (31). Chest radiographs were independently reviewed by two radiologists, and they found that 74% of the patients with alveolar and 62% with interstitial pneumonias had bacterial infection. An interstitial pattern of pneumonia on chest radiographs is therefore non-specific: it could be due to viral (26%), bacterial (30%), or mixed (44%) etiologies. Hence, distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonias in pediatric patients remains problematic, given the number of clinical and radiographic findings that overlap.",

            "text": "Several studies (43\u201350) have demonstrated that CT can often add information to the diagnosis, particularly in fungal infections and in complicated pneumonia cases. In a case series of 42 immunocompetent children, chest radiography was suboptimal in detecting abscesses, bronchopleural fistulae, fluid loculations, and parenchymal involvement when compared to CT (51). Chest radiograph accuracy rates were reported as follows: fluid loculations (42%), abscess formation (40%), bronchopleural fistulae (33%), and parenchymal involvement (84%). A limitation of this study is the lack of reported sensitivity and specificity values. Donelly and Klosterman performed a study of 56 patients with complicated pneumonia who were not responding to treatment. Chest CT was compared to a chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day. CT scans were evaluated for the presence of cavitary necrosis, abscess, bronchopleural fistula, cavitation, loculated pleural effusions, malpositioned chest tube, pericardial effusion, or bronchial obstruction (50). All 56 CT scans demonstrated at least one of the above findings that were not seen on chest radiographs (50). A total of 110 findings were seen on CT and not on chest radiography, with an average of approximately two findings per CT scan. Parenchymal complications totaled 40 and pleural complications 37. In another retrospective analysis of 17 children who underwent both CT scanning and chest radiography, evidence of cavity necrosis is often seen on CT before or in the absence of findings on chest radiographiy (52).",

            "text": "In the high-risk immunocompromised patients, it is absolutely critical to have a high sensitivity, as failure to detect results in failure to treat and subsequent high mortality (45). CT has been shown to have higher accuracy than plain radiography for early detection of pneumonia in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients (45, 48). For example, in a series of 48 patients (median age of 11 years and range of 2\u201319 years), chest radiographs and CT were rated independently by three experienced radiologists and subsequently correlated with biopsy or bronchoscopic washing results. CT was shown to identify more true-positive cases of bacterial and fungal pneumonias than radiography (91 versus 85%). Unfortunately, no detailed numbers of sensitivity and specificity were cited (45). In 87 adult patients with febrile neutropenia (median age 47, range 18\u201380 years), CT detected pneumonia 5 days on average earlier than chest radiographs and was more sensitive in the detection of poorly defined opacities, ill-defined nodules, consolidation, ground-glass opacities, pleural effusions, cavitations, and bullae (53). For the evaluation of children who are severely ill or immunocompromised for fungal infections and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), CT can add value. Janzen et al., in a retrospective review of 45 children who underwent both CT and chest radiography, found that the first-choice diagnosis was correct in 44% on chest CT and correct in 30% on chest radiography (p < 0.05) (49). Equivocal or normal chest radiographs are common, reported up to 39% in patients with PCP infection and up to 10% of patients with known pulmonary disease (17). CT can aid in the detection of fungal infections via identification of nodules, cavitation, ground-glass opacities, and halo effect (45\u201347). CT can play an important role such as in evaluating pulmonary aspergillosis and candidal pneumonias (45). In another study to evaluate if CT adds information to chest radiography, 33 cases were reviewed retrospectively (54). It was found that in 16 cases CT added no additional useful information, but in 17 cases CT added confidence and changed management (biopsy, changing antibiotics, bronchoscopy).",

There are several studies evaluating the prognostic implications of the use of ultrasound versus CT and the implications for treatment decisions. Ultrasound can be helpful in both prognosis and treatment decisions. It is a low-cost test, widely available, portable, does not use ionizing radiation, and rarely requires sedation. This has to be contrasted to CT, which has a relatively high radiation dose, in the order of 100 times that of a chest radiograph. Ultrasound is effective in demonstrating \u201chigh-grade\u201d effusions containing septations, fronds, loculations, and debris. US depiction of the thickness and number of these septations predicts the success of chest tube drainage (55). CT assists in providing a global assessment for pre-therapy planning, including the ability to demonstrate size, possible loculations, and the extent of lung involvement, including abscess formation or necrosis (51). Kearney et al. demonstrated in a retrospective review of 50 patients who underwent both US and CT that, although both US and CT have effective roles, neither technique reliably identified the stage of pleural effusions or predicted whether patients would require surgical intervention (56).",

Operative therapy included video thoracotomy, open decortication, or pleural debridement, and non-operative therapy included antibiotics alone with or without thoracentesis or chest tube placement. When the ultrasound detected high-grade effusions (evidence of organization such as fronds, septations, or loculations), the hospitalization stay was shorter (8.6 days) for patients eventually treated operatively, compared to those who were not (16.4 days). In non-operated patients in whom ultrasound revealed low-grade effusions, there was no significant difference in hospital stay length between patients treated with antibiotics alone and chest tube drainage (55). In another study, ultrasound has also been shown to be quite effective in identifying empyemas (59). In this prospective study of 1640 febrile patients admitted to the ICU, 94 patients underwent 118 ultrasound-guided thoracenteses for pleural effusions, identified by chest radiography and ultrasound. In 11/31 studies where a complex septated pattern and in all four where a diffusely hyperechoic pattern was reported, empyemas were confirmed with thoracentesis.

            "text": "As pleural effusions evolve, antibiotic therapy alone may not be sufficient. More aggressive intervention is often required. Beyond antibiotics, minimally invasive therapy with image-guided thoracentesis or chest tube drainage may be necessary. Thoracentesis is a standard procedure for the management of pleural effusions in adults. However, in children, thoracentesis is not easily performed as this procedure requires cooperation and frequently sedation. Patients treated with thoracentesis have been reported to require additional interventions due to recurrence (4, 6, 60). For example, Tu et al. found in 94 ICU patients with a pleural effusion suspected to have empyema that additional interventions were often needed; a total of 118 image-guided thoracentesis procedures were performed in this group (59). A prospective study of 67 patients with empyemas found that single chest tube placement versus repeated thoracentesis had no significant difference in outcome, thereby supporting that in children early thoracotomy tube drainage is preferred to thoracentesis, in order to avoid repeat interventions (61). In this study, the patients were prospectively divided into two treatment arms: chest tube placement (32 patients) and ultrasound-guided thoracentesis (35 patients). As assessed by chest radiography, the amount of fluid drained, the number of days that the patient was febrile, and the duration of antibiotic therapy, no statistical differences were found between both treatment arms.",

Separate subgroup analysis of proven loculated/septated effusions suggests a potential overall treatment benefit with fibrinolytics, but these results should be treated with caution. In children, fibrinolytic therapy has been reported in three studies with about 64 cases (63). There were no in-hospital deaths. The aggregate data revealed a failure rate of 9.3% and a complication rate of 12.5%. One of the studies was a 10-center randomized prospective study of urokinase undertaken by the British Paediatric Respiratory Society Empyema Study Group (64). They reported a slight reduction in length of stay in hospital compared to the saline group (7.4 versus 9.5 days). However, a major surgical concern with this therapy is that patients may be more likely to fail rescue VATS, as it has been suggested that urokinase causes intrapleural adhesions to become very adhesive (6).",
