PR causes substantial economic losses to the global swine industry [1], but has been largely controlled for at least 30 years using the Bartha-K61 vaccine. However, a novel PRV variant has emerged in China, and the Bartha-K61 vaccine has failed to provide complete protection [3,4,5,6]. Full-length genomic sequencing demonstrated that the PRV variant causing the outbreak belonged to a novel genotype [7]. Given the urgency of the outbreak and the need for a new vaccine, additional studies of PRV variants are critical. ",

Both traditional methods have considerable drawbacks. For example, the frequency and efficacy of the expected recombination by HR is quite low; and BAC mutagenesis is only available for virus isolates for which a useful BAC has been produced. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 can be applied to new isolates as they emerge in nature, with the only delay being the need to have sequence data for design of guide RNAs. In addition, inserting drug selection markers or parts of BAC plasmids into the viral genome may affect viral function [10]. However, genetic manipulation is essential for identifying gene function and for vaccine development.",

These approaches use a nuclease to specifically target a gene, cleaving the DNA to induce double-stranded breaks at the target site. The DNA break triggers cellular DNA repair mechanisms, including error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) [13]. Customizing gene disruption using either ZFNs or TALENs requires the design of specific proteins to target each dsDNA site [14,15], which requires several weeks and is labor and time intensive. However, gene knock out or gene knock in recombinants can be obtained within a short period by simply transfecting the CRISPR/Cas system, which is both efficient and convenient [16,17,18]. ",

Then, site mutagenesis was utilized to insert the 5\u2032 BamHI and 3\u2032 NotI sites that flank the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, sites for EcoRI, SalI, and XhoI were created followed by an SV40 poly(A) signal sequence. Next, BamHI and NotI were used to remove the EGFP gene from the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech, PaloAlto, CA, USA) and used to replace the neomycin gene (Tang-EGFP vector). The firefly luciferase gene was then amplified from the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and cloned into the Tang-EGFP vector between the NheI and PmeI sites. The right and left homologous arms were cloned from the PRV HeN1 strain by PCR and inserted between the CMV promoter and SV40 poly (A) signal. The final plasmid was termed the Tang-Luc-EGFP-HR vector. sgRNAs involved in this study were designed using the online CRISPR Design Tool [23], and target the gE, US2, US3 and US9 genes open reading frames. A human codon-optimized SpCas9 and the chimeric guide RNA expression plasmid PX330 were gifts from Feng Zhang [17,24].

To determine whether the expression of firefly luciferase and EGFP influenced the replication of the PRV-Luc-EGFP virus, one-step growth curves were performed for PRV-HeN1 and PRV-Luc-EGFP.

In short, effective CRISPR/Cas9 constructs would disrupt the PRV genome and inhibit viral replication, thereby decreasing luciferase activity. To test the designed sgRNAs, Vero cells were transfected with the CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, infected with PRV-Luc-EGFP 12 h later, and then luciferase activity was measured 24 hpi. As shown in Figure 2A, the sgRNAs US3-L3, US2-3, and US9-2 significantly reduced the amount of luciferase activity. To confirm the reduction in viral replication, we also assessed the effects of the sgRNAs on viral protein expression by Western blot. Consistent with the luciferase assay results, the cells transfected with the sgRNAs US3-L3, US2-3, and US9-2 had significantly decreased levels of US3 (Figure 2B). DNA breaks trigger the NHEJ repair pathway, which sometimes result in the introduction of crippling mutations and then inactivates gene expression. We next tested whether the sgRNAs would inactivate specific PRV genes. PRV-HeN1 treated with US3-L1, US2-3, and US9-2 was collected for plaque purification. Five (5) purified plaques were randomly selected to determine whether they had been inactivated based on US3 expression, and of these 60% (3/5) had reduced or no US3 expression (Figure 2C). No disruption was observed in the gI proteins, indicating the target specificity of sgRNA (Figure 2C). One of the plaques lacking US3 expression (plaque 4) was sequenced and found to be lacking two base pairs in the US3 region (Figure 2D). PRV strains lacking expression of US2 and US9 were generated using similar methods (Figure 2E,F). These results indicated that PRV-Luc-EGFP was a powerful tool for effectively screening for CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA.",

Chloroquine has been showed to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication [29], and may inhibit PRV may by same mechanisms, but this remains to be confirmed. CsA is a fungal metabolite that exerts profound effects on the immune system and is potentially a selective immuno-suppressive agent [30].

CsA has been reported to inhibit replication of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 [33], Hepatitis C Virus [34,35], PRRSV, and Equine arteritis virus [31]. With regard to herpes viruses in particular, CsA has been shown to inhibit HSV-1 replication [36,37]. Interestingly, in our study, CsA did not show any inhibitory activity against PRV in Vero cells.
