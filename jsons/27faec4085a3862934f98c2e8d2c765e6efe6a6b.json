[70] [71] [72] Recently, the OPTINIV trial compared the combination of HFNC 431 and NIPPV to NIPPV alone for preoxygenation in ICU patients requiring intubation for 432 hypoxemic respiratory failure. 73 The intervention group (HFNC + NIPPV) continued to receive 433 apneic oxygenation via HFNC while the NIPPV group alone received no further oxygenation 434 after the standardized 4-minute preoxygenation period. Authors found that the intervention 435 groups had higher minimum SpO 2 during intubation (100% vs 96%) and fewer episodes of 436 desaturation SpO 2 <80% (0% vs 21%) than the control group. 73 It is important to note that these preoxygenation strategies are effective in those requiring 443 intubation due to respiratory infections. In the study by Baillard et al, 65-70% of included 444 patients had a diagnosis of pneumonia. 67 Additionally, 35% of study participants in the 445 FLORALI-2 trial had primary respiratory failure due to infection. 68 Though discussion of airway 446 management for patients with novel COVID-19 is beyond the scope of this paper, in the midst of 447 a respiratory illness pandemic appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne 448 precautions, careful donning and doffing of PPE, and use of negative pressure rooms should be 449 employed to reduce the risk of disease transmission. If a negative pressure room is not available, 450 a private room with a closed door is recommended. If COVID-19 is suspected, video 451 laryngoscopy is recommended. Viral filters must also be appropriately utilized.

The inspiratory pressure can be increased 224 depending on the patient's response and tolerance, 49 usually not exceeding a peak inspiratory 225 pressure of ~20 cmH 2 O to avoid gastric insufflation. 15,54 When patients with obstructive lung 226 disease fail usual aggressive medical treatment and NIPPV, have a contraindication to NIPPV 227 (i.e. severely depressed mental status, inability to cooperate, etc.), or intolerance to NIPPV, 228 intubation and mechanical ventilation are needed. NIPPV may still be used to provide 229 preoxygenation and assistance with ventilation by \"delayed sequence intubation\" while preparing 230 for intubation as described by Weingart et al. 14 While the airway operator is maintaining the 231 mask seal and opening the airway, the NIPPV machine or a ventilator can be used to provide 232 breaths, with a safely set peak inspiratory pressure (i.e. <20-25 cmH 2 O) and a backup rate during233 induction. 15 Pearl: Trial and titrate NIPPV, along with aggressive medical management, in an attempt to 235 avoid intubation in those with obstructive lung disease. 236 237 Pitfall: Not anticipating the hemodynamic risk of a high intrathoracic pressure and decreased 238 venous return. 239 When choosing the induction agent in those with obstructive lung disease, clinicians should 240 consider comorbid conditions (i.e. heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, etc.) and the presenting 241 hemodynamic profile. A fluid bolus can be considered in this population due to the risk of 242 decreased venous return leading to hypotension, particularly in those at high risk for 243 hyperinflation or receiving NIPPV prior to intubation. 24,37 Ketamine may assist with 244 bronchodilation in those with bronchospasm from obstructive lung disease. 53,55,56 Ketamine also 245 allows for the maintenance of the respiratory drive if used in a delayed sequence strategy for 246 preoxygenation and ventilation with NIPPV. 14,15,25 247 Pearl: Ketamine may have bronchodilatory effects and is an ideal induction agent in 248 obstructive lung disease. 249 250 Pitfall: Inappropriate post intubation mechanical ventilation settings leading to breath 251stacking. 252Post-intubation mechanical ventilation places patients with obstructive lung disease at risk for air 253 trapping and dynamic hyperinflation, caused by incomplete exhalation before the next breath is 254given.28,49,53  This may lead to cardiovascular collapse by high intrathoracic pressure impairing 255 venous return to the right heart or barotrauma and pneumothorax. 24,49 Continued bronchodilator 256 therapy and aggressive medical management should continue while intubated.

            "text": "285 Pearl: Assess for air trapping on the ventilator. Air trapping from a high respiratory rate can 286 lead to hemodynamic collapse; a patient with a high spontaneous respiratory rate may require 287 deep sedation with or without neuromuscular blockade. The plateau pressure should be 288 assessed and maintained at < 30 cm H 2 O. 289 High airway resistance on pressure waveform. 291 Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Heart Failure, and Pulmonary Embolism 292 Pitfall: Failure to identify a patient with pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure. 293 Induction for intubation and positive pressure mechanical ventilation in those with pulmonary 294 hypertension (PH) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is risky, and improper management 295can lead to cardiovascular collapse. RV dysfunction is defined by abnormal RV filling or 296 contraction, while RV failure is defined by impaired RV function along with symptoms of heart 297 failure.57  In the ED this may be encountered as a chronic comorbidity with an acute insult (i.e. 298 sepsis, pneumonia, etc.) or as an acute process in the case of a pulmonary embolism (PE) or RV 299 infarction. Chronic elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure lead to chronic RV dysfunction or 300 failure and may result from underlying causes such as idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, 301 congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, left-sided heart disease, chronic pulmonary 302 emboli, and others. 57,58 A suggestive physical examination (i.e. JVD, peripheral edema) or 303 reported history of pulmonary hypertension or RV failure along with review of the patient's 304 medications, medical record, prior echocardiogram, or a point of care ultrasound, may help 305 identify these patients so that adverse events can be mitigated prior to an intubation attempt and 306 post intubation mechanical ventilation challenges can be anticipated.58  A bedside ultrasound with 307 RV dilation and enlargement > \u2154 the size of the left ventricle in the apical view or flattening of 308 the interventricular septum causing a D shape is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension or RV 309 dysfunction. 12,58 310 Pearl: Identify those with RV failure and pulmonary hypertension using history, physical 311 examination, and prior echocardiogram or point of care ultrasound to anticipate their 312 complex physiology. 313 314 Pitfall: Not anticipating and preparing for the hemodynamic challenges of pulmonary 315 hypertension, right heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. 316 The pulmonary vascular system is usually a low resistance circuit with a thin walled RV acting 317 as the pump against a low afterload, with a mean right sided pressure much lower than the 318 systemic left-sided pressure. 58,59 The RV has limited capacity to adapt to an acute rise in 319 afterload, and acute elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) may worsen RV 320 dysfunction and precipitate RV failure and hemodynamic collapse. 12,57,58 Based on 321 interventricular dependence, RV dilation and pressure overload may lead to bulging of the 322 interventricular septum and compromise left ventricular function and cardiac output. 57-60 Acute 323 hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction, and these precipitants 324 of an acute rise in PVR should be aggressively avoided in the failing RV. 57,58,61 The patient must 325 be preoxygenated, and during induction, hypercapnia and hypoxemia should be avoided. 49 Pearl: Avoid and manage precipitants of increased PVR including hypoxia, hypercapnia, and 327 acidosis. 328 329 Pitfall: Not treating hypotension, leading to an under perfused and ischemic right ventricle. 330 The RV is perfused during systole and diastole because of the typically low RV pressure and low 331 ventricular wall tension. 58,59 When the pulmonary artery (PA) pressure exceeds systemic blood 332 pressure, RV perfusion decreases, resulting in RV ischemia and a potentially deleterious cycle of 333 refractory RV failure, low cardiac output, hypotension, and hemodynamic collapse. 57,58 Pre-334 induction systemic hypotension or hypotension during an intubation attempt, particularly in 335 combination with an increase in PVR from hypoxemia or hypercapnia during an apneic period, 336 may precipitate this deadly cycle. 12,57 Norepinephrine can be used to maintain systemic blood 337 pressure in the patient with RV failure; phenylephrine should be avoided, as the pure alpha 1 338 effects will cause pulmonary vasoconstriction and an increase in PVR. 12,58 The induction agent 339 and dose should be carefully planned, favoring hemodynamically neutral agents such as 340 etomidate. 12 Those with RV failure and pulmonary hypertension are sensitive to changes in 341 preload. Volume overload may worsen RV dilation and ischemia, while hypovolemia will 342 decrease the cardiac output. 57 Unfortunately, the normal physical examination and ultrasound 343 findings of volume responsiveness are unreliable in this patient population. 12,57,58 If the history 344 suggests hypovolemia, a 250-500 mL fluid challenge can be administered, followed by a close 345 assessment for improvement. If the patient does not improve hemodynamically, further fluid 346 boluses are not recommended. 57,58 347 Pearl: Aggressively treat systemic hypotension with norepinephrine or cautious 250-500 mL 348 boluses only if the history suggests hypovolemia and use hemodynamically neutral induction 349 agents. The combination of a high PA pressure and low systemic blood pressure leads to RV 350 ischemia and risk of irreversible hemodynamic collapse. 351 352 Pitfall: Inappropriate mechanical ventilation settings leading to high intrathoracic pressure 353 post intubation 354 High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or NIPPV with low end expiratory pressures can be trialed in 355 an attempt to improve the respiratory failure and prevent invasive mechanical ventilation. These 356 non-invasive measures have the advantage of being easily removed should the positive pressure 357 cause hemodynamic compromise. 12,58 If preventative measures fail and the patient must be 358 intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, post intubation ventilation strategies should 359 focus on normalizing PaCO 2 , pH, and oxygenation while maintaining low airway pressure. 58,61 360 The positive pressure decreases RV preload and increases PVR, potentially exacerbating RV 361 failure and hemodynamic compromise. A strategy of a low plateau pressure, low tidal volume 362 (i.e. 6 mL/kg PBW), and low PEEP (i.e. 5 cm H 2 O) is recommended. 58,61 363 Pearl: The mechanical ventilation strategy in those with RV failure and pulmonary 364 hypertension includes normalizing PaCO 2 , pH, and PaO 2 with a low-pressure strategy using 365 low PEEP (i.e. 5 cm H 2 O) and a low tidal volume. 366 367 Pitfall: Failure to treat a pulmonary embolism prior to induction and mechanical ventilation. 368 PE is a common, acute cause of RV pressure overload. 57 The normal RV has difficulty acutely 369 generating > 40 mm Hg of pressure in the case of PE, causing an acute pressure overload. 57 370 Systemic thrombolytic therapy is recommended in the hemodynamically unstable patient and is 371 suggested either systemically or catheter directed in select cases of the intermediate-high risk 372 category with low bleeding risk (i.e. poor gas exchange, RV dysfunction, myocardial injury, 373 etc.). 62 If indicated, systemic thrombolytics should be administered prior to intubation; 374 thrombolysis may prevent the need for intubation or at the very least decrease the risk of peri-375 intubation cardiac arrest. If the patient with an acute PE must be intubated, the same 376 considerations of low pressure as previously discussed apply. 377 Pearl: In the patient with acute RV failure from PE, treatment with thrombolysis in the 378 unstable patient prior to intubation is recommended. 379 380 Advanced treatment considerations in those with RV failure or pulmonary hypertension with 381 post-intubation refractory shock or hypoxemia include inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (i.e. 382 inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol) and mechanical support devices, including extracorporeal 383 membrane oxygenation. Such complex cases should be discussed with the pulmonary 384 hypertension specialist center and critical care physician. 58 385 Pearl: Consider transfer to a specialty center for the intubated patient with known RV failure 386 and/or pulmonary hypertension. 387 Severe Hypoxemia 388 Pitfall: Failure to adequately preoxygenate prior to intubation. 389 Hypoxemic respiratory failure from pneumonia and other causes is a common indication for 390 intubation in the emergency department and ICU. However, despite being a necessary and life-391 saving procedure in critically ill patients, intubation can have deleterious consequences, 392including worsening hypoxemia and cardiovascular collapse. Severe hypoxemia during 393 intubation is associated with adverse outcomes and is a risk factor for intubation-related cardiac arrest. 13,34 Not surprisingly, oxygen saturation at induction and hypoxemic respiratory failure as 395 the indication for intubation are among the strongest predictors of hypoxemia during 396 intubation. 63 Pre-intubation hypoxemia and lack of preoxygenation were also found to be major 397 predictors of intubation-related cardiac arrest in ICU patients undergoing emergent intubation. 13 398Pearl: Pre-intubation hypoxemia and lack of preoxygenation are predictors of adverse events. 399Pitfall: Not using NIPPV or appropriate positioning during preoxygenation. 400Preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation are the two primary interventions that should be 401 employed to improve pre-intubation pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) and reduce the risk of desaturation, 402 with its subsequent complications, during intubation. Positioning during preoxygenation is 403 important in all patients, particularly in those that are obese, with a semi-upright or reverse 404Trendelenburg preferred. 64-66 Traditionally performed using a non-rebreather mask, several 405 studies have shown improved preoxygenation using NIPPV or HFNC in hypoxemic patients 406 requiring emergent intubation.67-69 Baillard et al. found that in severely hypoxemic patients 407",

Some call this approach \"resuscitative sequenced intubation\". 36 Volume resuscitation is recommended if hypovolemia is suspected. 165Hypotension from hypovolemia will be exacerbated by the decreased venous return with positive 166 pressure ventilation.24  Though beneficial for some, volume therapy should not be used167 indiscriminately. A recent study suggests a routine 500 mL fluid bolus prior to induction does 168 not prevent cardiovascular collapse. 37 In those with hypotension despite appropriate volume 169 resuscitation, an infusion of a balanced vasopressor such as norepinephrine with beta 1 adrenergic 170 activity to increase cardiac contractility and alpha 1 adrenergic activity to cause vasoconstriction 171 is recommended. 35,38 Epinephrine should be considered if there is bradycardia or if the patient is 172 unstable and in a pre-arrest state. 35 Phenylephrine is another option though less desirable in those 173 with a primary low output cardiogenic shock, as it is a pure alpha 1 vasoconstrictor and may result 174 in decreased cardiac output through an increase in afterload. 35,38,39 Furthermore, a significant rise 175 in afterload may be detrimental in those with myocardial ischemia causing cardiogenic 176 shock. 35,38,39 Bolus or push-dose vasopressors risk dosing errors and lack a proven benefit over 177 vasopressor infusions. 35,40 A vasopressor infusion should be initiated early, with adequate 178 volume resuscitation.
