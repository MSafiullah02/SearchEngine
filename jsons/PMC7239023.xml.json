In particular, there are hardly any studies on the current COVID-19 pandemic. For example, it was assumed that people with pre-existing health anxiety or hypochondriasis would be particularly vulnerable to anxiety and adverse behaviors during pandemics such as COVID-19, but there is little empirical research on this (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020).",

It was hypothesized that trait health anxiety moderates the level of virus anxiety (i.e., a stronger increase in virus anxiety when there is a stronger pre-existing health anxiety) and the relationship between cyberchondria and the current virus anxiety. Regarding emotion regulation, we assumed that dysfunctional emotion regulation has a positive relationship and adaptive emotion regulation a negative relationship with the current virus anxiety. In terms of favorable coping with the pandemic, we expected that the combination of favorable factors (feeling well informed and adaptive emotion regulation) should be associated with low virus anxiety (i.e., adaptive emotion regulation as a moderator in the relationship between being informed and current virus anxiety).",

Two subscales are distinguished: (a) health anxiety and the feared likelihood of becoming ill (14 Items) and (b) the feared negative consequences if the illness occurs (4 Items). This study used a validated German version of the SHAI (Bailer et al., 2013). The SHAI has shown good reliability and validity in previous studies (Alberts, Hadjistavropoulos, Jones, & Sharpe, 2013; Bailer et al., 2013; Salkovskis et al., 2002). In a meta-analysis of the SHAI (Alberts et al., 2013), an average total score (18 items, item coding: 0\u20133) of M = 12.41 (SD = 6.81) was found in non-clinical samples (n = 10 studies) and an average total score of M = 32.58 (SD = 9.57) in samples with patients with hypochondriasis (n = 5 studies). In the current study, the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was \u03b1 = .87 for the total scale, \u03b1 = .87 for the subscale of health anxiety and feared likelihood of illness, and \u03b1 = .69 for the subscale of negative consequences of illness.",

In previous studies, the subscale \u201cmistrust\u201d tended to be a separate construct, so that this subscale was excluded in the present study as well as in previous studies (Fergus, 2014; McElroy et al., 2019; Norr, Allan, Boffa, Raines, & Schmidt, 2015). This version with four subscales is also equivalent to the English short version with 12 items (CSS-12; McElroy et al., 2019). For the current study, the items have been slightly modified so that the Internet research refers to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., \"I panic when I read online that a symptom I have might be related to the coronavirus pandemic\"). The statements are answered using a five-point Likert scale from 1 = never to 5 = always. The CSS proved to be reliable and showed a positive correlation with the mSHAI (r = .57, p <  .001, Barke et al., 2016). Barke et al. (2016) found no association of CSS with age, but women showed higher values than men on the subscales excessiveness (Mwomen = 2.7, SD = 0.8; Mmen = 2.4, SD = 0.9), reassurance (Mwomen = 2.3, SD = 0.8; Mmen = 2.0, SD = 0.9), and distress (Mwomen = 1.8, SD = 0.8; Mmen = 1.6, SD = 0.7; no gender difference for compulsion: Mwomen = 1.5, SD = 0.6; Mmen = 1.4, SD = 0.7).

The role of trait health anxiety for the virus anxiety course was investigated using a repeated measures analyses of covariance (rANCOVA) with the centered covariate trait health anxiety. For checking the hypotheses on moderation, we used the PROCESS macro in SPSS (Hayes, 2017), including bootstrap method with 5,000 reiterations. In the moderation analyses, the total scores of the self-report measures were used (for health anxiety, the main subscale with 14 items). For all tests, the alpha level was set at .05 (5 %). Partial eta-squared (\u03b72\np) was calculated as effect size for rANOVA and rANCOVA (\u03b7\u00b2 \u2265 0.01 small effect; \u03b7\u00b2 \u2265 0.06 medium effect; \u03b7\u00b2 \u2265 0.14 large effect) and Cohen's d for (post-hoc) t-tests (d \u2265 0.30 small, d \u2265 0.50 medium, d \u2265 0.80 large). For correlation analyses, the effect size conventions are: r \u2265 |.10| small; r \u2265 |.30| medium, r \u2265 |.50| large (Cohen, 1992).",

It is possible that participants in the COVID-19 pandemic may have reported higher scores in the SHAI, as the self-report also covers the last 6 months. Alternatively, previous studies in non-clinical samples have been conducted almost exclusively on student samples that differ from the sample examined here in terms of socio-demographic variables (e.g., younger average age, higher average educational level), which could possibly also explain (smaller) differences in the SHAI scores. In comparison to an earlier study on cybechondria in the German general population (Barke et al., 2016), we found higher average scores in the subscale \"compulsion\" and lower average scores in the subscales \"excessiveness\" and \"reassurance\". Because we have adapted the CSS for the pandemic (e.g., search for symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), the results are only comparable to a limited extent. It is possible that due to the current media presence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Gao et al., 2020), during the pandemic people may be more often distracted from their activities and occupations by this topic, which could explain the increased scores in the subscale \"compulsion\". With regard to the subscales \"excessiveness\" and \"reassurance\", the lower levels found here could be explained by the fact that possible symptoms of an infection are searched online less often compared to other topics of the pandemic, and that during the COVID-19 pandemic doctors are visited less often (Mehrotra, Chernew, Linetsky, Hatch, & Cutler, 2020).",

As in the study by Moghanibashi-Mansourieh (2020), middle-aged people (in this study: 30-59 years) reported a stronger anxiety associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, possibly because this age group is facing greater family and job concerns (e.g., financial worries). At first glance differing from previous studies (Lai et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020a), this study found that people who work in the health care sector report less virus anxiety. However, to date, hardly any studies have directly compared health care workers with employees in other sectors, and in contrast to other studies, this study has broadly defined the health care sector (e.g., including psychology, nutrition, physiotherapy) and specifically asked about the fear of the virus rather than more general anxiety symptoms. The result of this study could be explained by the fact that healthcare workers are more accurately informed about the virus and the pandemic and are confronted with this issue in their daily work, which could possibly lead to a habituation-like effect.",

            "text": "Concerning the links among trait health anxiety, cyberchondriaPandemic, and virus anxiety, we found consistently significant positive correlations. The positive correlation between health anxiety and cyberchondria is consistent with cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety and previous findings (Brown et al., 2019; McMullan, Berle, Arn\u00e1ez, & Starcevic, 2019). In addition, this study showed that excessive Internet use in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular, the resulting stress are also positively related to health anxiety. Furthermore, we found for the first time that the stronger the cyberchondria, the higher the current virus anxiety. This could also confirm the more frequently assumed assumption that excessive media consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased anxiety (Garfin et al., 2020). Even though we have examined state anxiety (\"today\"), and cyberchondria refers to a longer period of time, we cannot draw any causal conclusions with our study design. The relationship with the subscale \u201cseeking reassurance\u201d was very weak (r = .09/.12, p <  .001) in contrast to the other subscales of cyberchondriaPandemic (r = .19\u201348, p <  .001). The items of this subscale refer to the fact that the Internet search leads to a doctor's visit or that the results of the Internet search are discussed with the doctor, which is likely to be less relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., a tendency to avoid visits to the doctor by recommending to visit a doctor only in urgent cases or with clear symptoms, or fears of being infected related to the visit to the doctor). The perception of being informed about the pandemic was consistently negatively correlated (albeit rather weakly correlated) with current virus anxiety, health anxiety, and cyberchondria. Feeling well informed thus seems to have a buffering and beneficial effect on the emotional state; on the other hand, people who feel well-informed seem to conduct less excessive and burdensome Internet research. This finding is also in line with current models of cyberchondria (Brown et al., 2019; Starcevic & Berle, 2013). Excessive Internet searches may have started in the hope of gaining information and relief (e.g., positive meta-beliefs such as \u201cI need the Internet research during the pandemic to be better prepared\"), but more often, on the contrary, result in a wealth of (often ambiguous) information and increased anxiety.",

As expected, this increase was significantly stronger for individuals with increased health anxiety. This also corresponds to cognitive-behavioral models (Williams, 2004; Witth\u00f6ft & Hiller, 2010) that trait characteristics (such as trait anxiety) represent a vulnerability to health concerns. Specifically for the context of pandemics, it seems to confirm assumptions that pre-existing health anxiety can be a risk factor for increased anxiety during pandemics (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020). Cyberchondria might also play a relevant role in this relationship. We also found that when health anxiety and high cyberchondria are combined, virus anxiety is strongest (health anxiety as a moderator)\u2014i.e., when these two factors come together, people suffer from severe anxiety about SARS-CoV-2. In accordance with our hypotheses, the higher the maladaptive emotional regulation, the higher the virus anxiety, and the higher the adaptive emotional regulation, the lower the virus anxiety (although the last correlation was very weak). Additionally, it was found that a combination of adaptive emotion regulation and the perception of being informed about the pandemic is associated with little or no virus anxiety (adaptive emotion regulation as moderator, Fig. 2). In particular, acceptance (to accept what has been experienced and what has happened) and putting into perspective (to put into perspective and compare with worse events, e.g. that there are worse things in life) proved to be favorable emotion regulation strategies. This is consistent with previous studies, which also found negative correlations between acceptance and putting into perspective, and anxiety (Garnefski, Legerstee, Kraaij, van den Kommer, & Teerds, 2002; Martin & Dahlen, 2005). Concerning interventions, it was also shown that acceptance-based strategies are effective in reducing anxiety and somatoform complaints (Kelson, Rollin, Ridout, & Campbell, 2019; Kleinst\u00e4uber, Gottschalk, Berking, Rau, & Rief, 2016; Twohig & Levin, 2017).",

In terms of risk factors, it should be easier to reduce them with regard to cyberchondria, such as by educating and recommending behavior for the population (e.g., that excessive use of the Internet can increase anxiety; recommending reputable sources; basic help to reduce cyberchondria) and that recommendations should also be followed in media reporting (e.g., concrete/accurate, reputable information, avoiding fear-inducing language). This is also linked to the finding that feeling informed can have a buffering effect on anxiety and shows the importance of accurate and confident information and effective communication (Garfin et al., 2020). In the age of digitalization and online intervention, it is also conceivable that interventions to reduce health anxiety and/or promote adaptive emotion regulation strategies in the form of evaluated online tools could be a promising way to reduce anxiety during virus pandemics.",

Although the study covers a large sample, it is not representative of the German general population in terms of socio-demographic variables (79.8% female, M\nage = 33.36 years, 39.4% students). In addition, the type of recruitment (including social media) as well as the online nature of the study probably appealed more to people with an Internet affinity. It is possible that persons with a higher affinity for the Internet and online activities also show higher overall values in cyberchondria. Compared to the study by Barke et al. (2016), however, the sample of this study showed lower values in two subscales (and a higher and a comparable value in another subscale each). Concerning the information on the pandemic, the subjective evaluation of being informed was assessed, as it was assumed that the subjective experience is more associated with anxiety than with objectively assessed knowledge (e.g., through a quiz). However, it would have been interesting to examine whether the subjective evaluation is related to the objectively assessed knowledge and how the latter is related to anxiety. The virus anxiety in December 2019 and end of January 2020 was retrospectively recorded. This data could be influenced by memory bias, by interpretations depending on the current context (e.g., \u201cCurrently the pandemic is much stronger, I was hardly worried at all at an earlier time\u201d), or by assumptions about a possible course. Overall, it would be promising for future studies to conduct longitudinal studies (e.g., ecological momentary assessments) to assess anxiety during virus outbreaks in order to be able to draw causal conclusions. Since the implementation of this study, three standardized self-report measures have been published that were specifically designed to assess anxiety and distress during the coronavirus pandemic, the \u201cCOVID Stress Scales\u201d (CSS; Taylor et al., 2020; e.g., \u201cI am worried about catching the virus.\u201d), the \"Fear of COVID Scale\" (FC-19S; Ahorsu et al., 2020; e.g., \"I am most afraid of coronavirus-19.\"), and the \"Coronavirus Anxiety Scale\" (CAS; Lee, 2020; e.g., \"I had trouble falling or staying asleep because I was thinking about the coronavirus.\"). Due to the heterogeneity of measurement methods and individual, non-validated, questions in previous studies, it would be essential for the comparability and validity of studies on anxiety and distress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that these instruments continue to be tested and are increasingly used in future COVID-19 studies.",

Regarding potential buffering effects on anxiety, the study found negative correlations between the perception of being informed and the virus anxiety. Current virus anxiety was particularly low when individuals feel well informed and when they use adaptive emotion regulation strategies (acceptance and putting into perspective). These findings may indicate starting points for interventions in times of a virus outbreak, such as the reduction of cyberchondria, providing and disseminating accurate information about the pandemic and effective communication through the media, as well as the promotion of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.",
