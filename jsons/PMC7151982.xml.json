Travelers may be at increased risk of certain respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to travel itself (mingling and close quarters in airports, airplanes, cruise ships and hotels, and risk of influenza, legionella, and tuberculosis) and due to unique exposure at travel destinations (melioidosis, plague, Q fever, and coccidioidomycosis). Travel-related respiratory infections can lead to importation and secondary transmission, as occurred during the global SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003, and have occurred repetitively with influenza and tuberculosis.5, 6 This chapter reviews causative agents, clinical manifestations, and management approaches for travel-related RTIs.",

Acute laryngitis is characterized by hoarseness of voice with a deepened pitch, with possible episodes of aphonia. Often these signs are associated to those of coryza and pharyngitis. Common causes of laryngitis include parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Less frequently, laryngitis can be caused by bacteria including Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pharyngitis is also most commonly viral in origin, although streptococcal disease accounts for a significant minority. Other causes of pharyngitis include Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",

Approximately 35% of all RTIs were characterized as lower tract infection, with 35% of these classified as pneumonia and over 50% being classified as bronchitis.16 Prolonged travel, travel involving visiting friends and relatives, and travel during the northern hemisphere winter increased the likelihood of influenza and lower respiratory tract infections in this cohort.16\n",

No additional diagnostic procedures are required and treatment is usually supportive. The diagnosis of laryngitis is also clinical, and treatment is usually supportive. Although the diagnosis of pharyngitis is also clinical, it is important to identify individuals with pharyngitis caused by group A streptococcal infection from other causes to lessen the likelihood of subsequent sequelae, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. Bacterial pharyngitis is reportedly associated with more severe pharyngeal pain, odynophagia, and higher fever, with grayish-yellow exudate on the tonsils and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, clinical criteria are unreliable to identify bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis because a typical presentation occurs in <50% of cases. Rapid antigen detection tests are available with a specificity >90% and sensitivity of 60\u201395%, and should generally be performed in patients ill enough to seek medical care for pharyngitis, especially in young children, in whom the risk of streptococcal disease is highest. The need to perform a bacterial culture if a rapid test is negative is debated. A treatment course with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is appropriate to treat pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes. Diphtheria is a rare cause of pharyngitis, with a potentially fatal outcome. It is characterized by a thick and gray pharyngeal and tracheal membrane that bleeds upon attempted removal. Diagnosis is based on clinical recognition and culture isolation of a toxigenic strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The mainstay of therapy is diphtheria antitoxin, associated with antibiotic treatment with penicillin or macrolides. Vaccination effectively eliminates the risk of travel-related pharyngeal diphtheria.",

Examination usually discloses pulmonary crepitation, rhonchi, and adventitial sounds. Chest imaging should be used to further characterize and define pulmonary involvement. Complications of pneumonia include pulmonary cavitation, pneumothorax, and empyema formation. In many facilities, it is now standard to collect nasopharyngeal swabs or washings from patients with severe RTIs and pneumonia, and to apply rapid antigen tests to assess for common respiratory viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and metapneumonia virus. Although the majority of cases with radiologic evidence of pneumonia may still have a viral infection, the proportion of cases due to bacteria is high enough to usually warrant systematic antibacterial treatment, especially if a viral screen is unrevealing. The chest film is not helpful in making a specific etiologic diagnosis; however, lobar consolidation, cavitation, and large pleural effusions support a bacterial cause. Pneumococcal disease is often characterized by abrupt onset of fever, cough, rapid respiration, and lobar consolidation on chest film. Atypical pneumonias caused by M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may be characterized by gradual onset of symptoms, cough progressive from dry to productive, chest film worse than symptoms, and normal peripheral white blood cell counts. Overall, however, the clinical presentation is not specific enough to make an etiologic diagnosis, and effective methods to recognize the causative agent of pneumonia are not available. The sputum Gram stain is a simple, quick, and inexpensive procedure, but its helpfulness in establishing a specific etiologic diagnosis is uncertain. The utility of the sputum culture is also unclear, since the procedure is insensitive: only half of patients with pneumonia produce sputum and contamination occurs in one-third. An advantage of routine sputum Gram stain and culture is that these procedures would capture rare causes of pneumonia such as tuberculosis and melioidosis in travelers. Because the cause of pneumonia cannot be determined on the basis of any specific clinical, radiographic, or laboratory parameter, antibiotic therapy is usually begun empirically. Treatment should be effective on S. pneumoniae, the most frequently responsible agent, and on agents of atypical pneumonia: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionella infections.",

H5N1 has resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred recognized human cases, and a high case-fatality rate. Human cases continue to accumulate. Currently, avian influenza H5N1 virus continues to circulate in poultry in some countries, especially in Asia and northeast Africa. In June 2011, Egypt and Indonesia confirmed their 150th and 178th human cases of avian flu, respectively. Of the 150 cases confirmed in Egypt, 52 have been fatal, compared to 146 of 178 in Indonesia.43 Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings shed by infected birds. Transmission requires direct contact with birds or their droppings. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead birds or birds showing signs of disease. Human-to-human transmission has fortunately been very sporadic thus far, and limited to very close contacts. However, should the virus mutate to become steadily transmissible in the human community, a new deadly pandemic influenza could emerge. Human cases of avian influenza are characterized by severe pneumonia, which is frequently rapidly fatal. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably oseltamivir, can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival.44\n",

The presenting symptoms are non-specific, with mild fever, malaise, and a non-productive cough. After a period of a few days in which the patient's condition apparently improves, a second phase begins with high fever, respiratory distress, cyanosis, and subcutaneous edema of the neck and thorax. Crepitant rales are evident on auscultation. Inhalation anthrax is almost invariably fatal with a very short time between the onset of the second phase, mediastinal signs, and death. The diagnosis of inhalation anthrax is extremely difficult outside of epidemic conditions. Direct examination and Gram stain of the sputum specimen are unlikely to be positive. A serologic ELISA test is available, although a significant increase in titer is usually obtained only in convalescent subjects who survive. The most useful bacteriologic test in case of suspicion, however, is a blood culture demonstrating B. anthracis. Treatment of inhalation anthrax should be as early as possible and usually involves a carbapenem, penicillin, doxycycline, and fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.

This rate is very similar to that of native populations in the visited countries, and much higher than the 0.01% yearly risk in The Netherlands.72 Abubakar et al. recently provided the first evidence in the UK that travel to countries with high levels of TB infection may be an independent risk factor for acquiring LTBI. This effect was not mitigated by BCG vaccination.73 A recent systematic review using tuberculin skin testing (TST) conversion as a surrogate for LTBI calculated the cumulative incidence of LTBI in long-term (median 11 months) travelers to be 2%, which is what could be expected among local populations in many developing countries.74 Other factors identified for increased TB risk among travelers were: being a healthcare worker, a longer cumulative duration of travel, and a longer total time spent in TB-endemic countries.72\n",

Travelers represent the primary vehicle of the yearly spread of influenza around the globe, and are critical to the global spread of new pandemics. Effective anti-influenza vaccines exist, and all travelers should receive yearly influenza immunization and be instructed in hand-washing and cough/sneeze hygiene. All travelers should also be up to date for other vaccines, including those that prevent RTIs, including measles, pneumococcal diseases, Hib, diphtheria, and pertussis. Clinicians caring for an ill returned traveler with an RTI should characterize the illness as upper or lower tract RTI, and consider the travel itinerary, exposure history, clinical manifestations, incubation period, and host-specific conditions.",
