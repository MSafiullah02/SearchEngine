            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and comprise three of its genera: Influenza virus A, B, and C (IAV, IBV, and ICV, respectively). ICV is commonly associated with fever, coughing, and rhinorrhea in children, and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in infants (Matsuzaki et al., 2006). In addition to humans, swine infection with human ICV has been reported in China (Guo et al., 1983). In 2011, a novel influenza virus was reported in swine from Oklahoma (Hause et al., 2013) with 50% protein sequence identity with ICV but no cross-reactivity with human ICV generated serum. This virus was provisionally defined as influenza D virus (IDV) (Hause et al., 2014). IDV is a single-strand, negative sense RNA virus with 7 genome segments that are predicted to encode 9 proteins, including glycoprotein hemagglutinin\u2013esterase fusion (HE), polymerases PB2, PB1, and P3, nucleoprotein, matrix proteins (M1 and CM2), and nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NEP). To date, bovine IDV has been reported in United States, France, and China (Ducatez et al., 2015, Hause et al., 2013, Jiang et al., 2014). In the United States, IDV has been reported in cattle population in Texas, California, and in Midwestern states, such as Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma, suggesting, based on serological investigation, that cattle are the natural host reservoir of this new virus (Hause et al., 2014). Furthermore, metagenomic analysis showed that IDV is one of the common microbes identified via metagenomics sequencings of Californian dairy calves diagnosed as bovine respiratory diseases (BRD) from single farm (Ng et al., 2015), suggesting a correaltion of IDV with BRD.",

Thirteen of the 16 positive specimens from sick calves and both of the positive specimens from healthy calves were succesfully isolates in cell culture. Two samples had signs of myotic contamination due to lack of anti-fungal in the transport media, but filtration after primary passage made it possible to isolate one of these two contaminated samples.",

The higher rates of detection we observed might be due to our targeted sampling of six to eight-month old calves that were immunologically na\u00efve, comingled, and recently weaned. Although we were unable to document active infection among the 65 calves at arrival to the order-buying facility, active infections were observed 1 week after arrival in two of the 24 calves sampled. Seroprevalence was 21.5% on arrival and did not appear to change within the first week following arrival among healthy calves. This data suggests the transmission of IDV occurred after arrival in this population of highly stressed, comingled, and immunologically na\u00efve calves based on the proportion of IDV positive respiratory swabs among calves with respiratory disease being greater than healthy calves. However, an epidemiological study is needed to test the hypothesis that IDV infection would be associated with BRD. Sick calves that were IDV positive had been at the facility for 19.4 days (\u00b17.5), suggesting that active infection could occur as early as one week post-entry to the order-buying facility. The two apparently healthy calves that were IDV positive had both been maintained in the same lot, but had only been at the facility for seven days.",

A metagenomics analysis of the respiratory specimens from 50 dairy calves with BRD demonstrated that contig reads of bovine adenovirus 3, bovine rhinitis A virus, and IDV were identified among in 62% of these specimens, either alone or altogether (Ng et al., 2015).

The half-life of passively acquired IgG is typically 21.2\u201335.9 days; therefore, calves maintain passive immunity for roughly three to four months (Fulton et al., 2002). However, the dynamics of maternal antibodies are pathogen dependent. Our results demonstrated that 94% of neonatal cattle sampled in 2013 and 2014 obtained maternal immunity against IDV via maternal colostrum, which appeared to decrease with age. At the age of six to eight months, only 3.7\u201311.5% of calves were seropositive. Thus, after six months, many cattle were likely susceptible to IDV infection. Furthermore, when we look at the seroprevalence from youth to one year, we found an increase from 11.7% at 8 months (n=188) to 66.7% at 1 year (n=42). It is understood that management style can affect cattle overall health. In our study, we found that six to eight-month old healthy calves held in an order-buyer facility had a seropositive rate of 21.5% at entry (n=65) and 25.0% at one week (n=24); whereas six to eight months calves in a cow-calf operation had a seropositive rate of 5.8% (n=484). We attribute these differences to the fact that cattle held at the order-buyer facilities were all weaned, transported, auctioned, and comingled among cattle of similar ages and similar susceptibilities.

Sanger sequencing was performed by Eurofin (Huntsville, AL) using publically available primer sequences (Ducatez et al., 2015). The GenBank accession numbers are KT581409 to KT581418.",

            "text": "Hemagglutination assay (HA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assayHA and HAI assays were performed according to the World Health Organization manual on animal influenza diagnosis and surveillances (http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/influenza/WHO_manual_on_animal-diagnosis_and_surveillance_2002_5.pdf) using 0.5% turkey red blood cells in U-bottom 96 well plates (USA Scientific, Ocala, FL). Sera were treated 1:3 with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 37 \u00b0C for 18\u201320 h, followed by heat inactivation at 55 \u00b0C for 30 min. Inactivated serum was diluted to a final concentration of 1:10 with 1\u00d7PBS. The assay was conducted at room temperature for detection of D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014 specific antibodies. HAI results were confirmed by HAI for D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 specific antibodies for a subset of serum samples. A serum with a HAI titer \u22651:40 was defined as seropositive.Cell line and viral isolationHuman Rectal Tumor cells (HRT-18G) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were propagated in 1x DMEM (Gibco\u00ae Life Technologies) with 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco\u00ae Life Technologies) and 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco\u00ae Life Technologies). IDV isolates were recovered from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs in 90\u201395% confluent HRT-18G cells in T-25 cell culture flasks. Cells were gently washed twice with sterile PBS and media was replaced with 5 mL of 1x Opti MEM cell culture media (Gibco\u00ae Life Technologies) with 8% of Bovine Serum Albumin (Gibco\u00ae Life Technologies), 1% of Pen/Strep (Gibco\u00ae Life Technologies), and 1:2000 TPCK-trypsin. Swab media (120 \u03bcL) was incubated at 4 \u00b0C with 80 \u03bcL Pen/Strep and 800 \u03bcL media for one hour to reduce bacterial contamination prior to addition to the culture flask, at 1:50 the total volume. Culture was maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 and virus was harvested 5 days post infection. Subsequent viral passage was performed at 1:50 inoculation and were screened by HA prior to confirmation of positive isolates by PB1 gene based quantitative RT-PCR. Four isolates, which includes the isolate D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014 to be used in HAI assays, were further tested at the Mississippi Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Pearl, MS, for common BRD including bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (PI3), adenovirus, coronavirus, bovine herpesvirus (BHV), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). The goals of these tests were be sure the HA positive isolates were clear of coinfection after cell culture prior to application in downstream experiments. No swabs or other IDV isolates was subjected to these tests.Molecular characterization, phylogenetic analyses, and statistical analysesSequence assembly was conducted using Lasergene version 8.0.4. Multiple sequence alignments were conducted by the MUSCLE software package (Edgar, 2004). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed by using GARLI version 0.96 (Zwickl, 2006) and maximum-likelihood with bootstrap resampling analyses with 1000 runs by using PAUP* 4.0 Beta (Swofford, 1998) with a neighbor-joining method as previously described (Wan et al., 2008). Geometric mean titer (GMT), standard deviation, and percent positive were calculated using Microsoft Excel. For GMT, only positive samples were used in the calculation.",
