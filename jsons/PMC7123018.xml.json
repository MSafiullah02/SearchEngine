Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and can infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Influenza A virus subtypes are classified on the basis of the antigenicity of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [1, 2] into 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes, and all of these subtypes have been found to infect birds [2, 3]. Waterfowl and shorebirds are the natural reservoirs of AI viruses.",

An influenza virus with a novel HA and/or NA can be introduced into the human population by direct spread from either wild birds or domestic poultry, as was seen when an H5N1 AI virus infected humans in 1997 [6].

The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is derived from influenza viruses that were circulating in pigs rather than birds.

In this chapter, we discuss the main features of the animal models used for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, their advantages and disadvantages, and their contribution to research on vaccines against influenza in humans. We also discuss the role of animal models in the development of vaccines against pandemic influenza.

Antigenic drift results from point mutations in and around antibody-combining sites in the HA and NA proteins. Influenza virus vaccines are unusual in that one or more of the components of the trivalent vaccine formulation may have to be changed annually to keep pace with antigenic drift of the virus, but as long as a licensed manufacturing process is used, the change in composition of the vaccine is considered a strain change and is not treated as a new vaccine. Approval of seasonal influenza vaccines for use in humans requires limited testing in animals, and an evaluation of immunogenicity in humans is required in Europe but not in the United States.",

Extensive pre-clinical characterization of these new vaccines in animals will be necessary. Many researchers are engaged in efforts aimed at developing \u201cuniversal\u201d influenza vaccines that can protect against both epidemic and pandemic strains by targeting the more conserved antigens of the virus, such as nucleoprotein (NP) or the matrix protein (M), thus eliminating the need for having to constantly update the composition of the annual seasonal influenza vaccine. The immune responses to candidate universal vaccines are entirely different from those elicited by the currently licensed seasonal inactivated influenza virus vaccines, where protective immunity is based mainly on neutralizing antibodies produced against the HA protein.

Shortly after the first human influenza virus was isolated from ferrets in 1933 by Wilson Smith and colleagues at the National Institute for Medical Research in London [17], it was discovered that human influenza viruses would cause disease in mice only if they were first adapted to the species by serial passages in the lungs [18]. This was subsequently found to be true for all human influenza virus isolates. One of the most commonly used human influenza viruses in mice is influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), an H1N1 virus with a complex passage history, including several passages in ferrets, and hundreds of passages in eggs and mice (CB Smith, CDC, Atlanta, GA, personal communication). This virus is well adapted to mice and causes a lethal infection. The need for adaptation through serial passage of human influenza viruses is one of the major drawbacks of using mice in influenza research, because many mutations can arise during adaptation to the murine host; [19\u201322] these can alter their replication kinetics, and can result in the ability of the virus to escape the host innate immune responses [23].",

Depending on the strain of virus used, mice may become lethargic, anorexic, develop ruffled fur, and may also exhibit neurological symptoms of infection, in addition to weight loss, which is often the primary objective measure of the severity of infection. Body temperature is not a useful measurement in mice because hypothermia can occur following infection with mouse-adapted viruses. Irrespective of whether an influenza virus induces morbidity or mortality in mice, the level of replication of influenza viruses in the lungs is the most informative endpoint for efficacy studies in mice since even a modest reduction in titer of infectious virus in the lungs can be associated with survival from lethal infection [24, 25]. Mice immunized with influenza viruses or vaccines develop serum HAI and neutralizing antibodies, the titers of which correlate with protection from subsequent challenge. Studies by Virelizier [26] demonstrated that antibody alone could protect against influenza infection in mice. Passive transfer of immune serum to naive mice resulted in a reduction in the replication of virus in the lungs and protected the recipient mice from lethal influenza pneumonitis, but did not prevent tracheitis or replication of virus in the upper respiratory tract [27]. The observation that passively transferred serum antibodies can reduce pulmonary viral replication but not viral replication in the upper respiratory tract is not unique to influenza A. Similar observations have been reported with influenza C virus [28], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [29] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections [30]. Measuring the amount of virus in various tissues in cases where high levels of serum antibody are present, for example, when vaccines are administered with adjuvant, should be done by quantitative molecular methods to rule out the possibility of ex vivo neutralization by serum antibody during tissue preparation. Such ex vivo neutralization has been shown to account for a reduction of up to 300-fold in detectable virus in the lungs of mice that had undergone passive transfer of immune serum against SARS-CoV [30]. The use of nasal and bronchiolar wash samples, instead of tissue homogenates, for viral quantitation was also employed as a solution to this issue [28].",

Sadowski and co-workers reported that intranasal administration of human influenza virus to lightly anesthetized, outbred young adult cotton rats resulted in virus replication in the respiratory tract, the production of pulmonary lesions and a strong immune response [46]. In recent years, there has been some renewed interest in the cotton rat as a laboratory animal model for human influenza virus infection. Species-specific reagents that permit more detailed analysis of viral pathogenesis and immune responses in this species have been developed [45] and inbred cotton rats are now available. The advantages of this model include the fact that cotton rats can be infected by non-adapted human influenza viruses, inbred animals are available, the virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract, some clinical parameters can be measured, and viral infection results in histopathological changes in the lungs that are similar to those seen during natural infection of humans [47].

Ferrets can be infected with non-adapted human influenza virus isolates. Influenza virus infection in ferrets is primarily an upper respiratory tract infection, and infected ferrets exhibit clinical signs of infection similar to those seen during human influenza including fever, rhinitis and sneezing. The disadvantages of the ferret as a model for studying influenza vaccines include expense, special housing requirements, a limited number of suppliers, difficulties in obtaining animals that are seronegative for influenza virus, their exquisite sensitivity to other respiratory pathogens and ease of acquiring infection from their handlers, and the lack of species-specific reagents, although this last point does not present an obstacle for the evaluation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses.

From a practical standpoint, these animals are expensive and they have not proven to be the best model for the study of vaccines for influenza.

It was determined early in the days of the study of influenza virus biology that non-human primate species were not as susceptible to human influenza viruses as their human relatives. Burnet reported in 1941 [48] that clinical signs of infection were only apparent in cynomolgus macaques when they were infected via the intratracheal route as opposed to the intranasal route. Interestingly, mortality was observed in animals inoculated with the \u201cW.S. Egg\u201d strain, which was a mouse-adapted human influenza virus that had been passaged in eggs. Burnet reported that pathological changes consistent with those seen in human influenza infection were observed in the lungs of infected monkeys. The observation that intratracheal infection in monkeys might be required to achieve clinical signs of infection was supported by studies conducted by Saslaw and colleagues [49] in Rhesus macaques. Intratracheal infection of Rhesus macaques with a lung filtrate from mice infected with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus resulted in clinical signs of illness on day 2 post infection (p.i.), which resolved by day 4 p.i., whereas no signs of illness were apparent in monkeys inoculated with the same virus preparation intranasally, although both groups of animals showed hematological and serological evidence of infection.",

Eight of ten animals inoculated intratracheally with the A/New Jersey/76 (H1N1) virus had mild upper respiratory tract illness, but only one of ten animals shed virus.

However, the use of chimpanzees as animal models in research is logistically difficult. They are extremely expensive animals that require long-term care and stringent isolation since they are susceptible to several human pathogens. Chimpanzees have been used for some studies of influenza [54, 56, 57]. Influenza A and B viruses replicated to high titer in seronegative chimpanzees, but viral replication was not associated with illness. The advantages of studying influenza in this species include the fact that chimpanzees have the same body temperature as humans, their lower respiratory tract can be repeatedly sampled safely, they display permissiveness for vectored vaccines, similar to humans (for example, vaccinia-based vaccines), they are evolutionarily close to humans, and this may mean that similar host-range restrictions for replication of viruses may be present which could facilitate the selection of live attenuated candidate vaccines for testing in humans.",

Researchers began to address this question in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the infant rat was extensively investigated as a model to predict the restriction in the replication of live attenuated influenza vaccines in humans [42\u201344].

            "text": "Although vaccine safety can only be fully assessed when a vaccine is administered to human subjects, regulatory authorities usually recommend standard tests for pre-clinical evaluation of the safety of new canidiate vaccines. The primary safety concern for inactivated influenza virus vaccines is reactogenicity, and for live attenuated influenza vaccines, it is their level of attenuation and their genetic stability. Standard toxicology tests on new vaccine candidates are often performed in rabbits, although current WHO guidelines for nonclinical evaluation of vaccines recommend that toxicology studies be performed in an animal species that most closely reflects the immune response to the vaccine in humans, or is \u201csensitive to the biological effects of the vaccine\u201d, and use the same dose and route of administration to be studied in clinical trials [58]. The design and results of such studies should be reviewed with special attention to experimental details such as the route of administration, volume and quantity of virus in the inoculum, and whether or not anesthesia was used, particularly for live attenuated vaccines, because each of these factors can influence the outcome. Toxicity following administration of very high doses of live influenza virus to animals via a variety of routes has been reported in the literature. For example, administration of 109 EID50 of influenza virus administered intranasally resulted in complete pulmonary consolidation and death in mice, and this pathology occurred despite restricted replication of virus in lung tissue [59]. Henle and Henle [60] reported inflammation in the gut, damage to the liver and spleen, and death in mice given high doses of influenza virus intraperitoneally. Similar findings were observed in rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. Lung inflammation was observed in ferrets administered high titer live attenuated influenza viruses intranasally [61] and systemic signs of illness were reported in human volunteers who received attenuated influenza viruses at doses that exceeded 107 TCID50 [62\u201364]. In these studies, signs of clinical illness, including fever and other systemic signs, appeared within 48 h of administration of the virus, which is more rapid, in general, than the appearance of symptoms associated with a productive influenza virus infection. The systemic symptoms did not correlate with the titer of virus shed in respiratory secretions, or with the occurrence of respiratory symptoms. The occurrence of systemic illness in humans following administration of high doses of influenza virus in the absence of high levels of virus replication may be explained by the innate immune response to an abortive infection of epithelial cells.",

Limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the guinea pig as a model to study immunity to influenza virus. Phair and colleagues [39] demonstrated that infection of guinea pigs with unadapted human influenza viruses resulted in resistance to challenge with a homologous virus, and that passive transfer of hyperimmune serum to naive guinea pigs also conferred protection against infection. However, the levels of HAI antibody detected in the serum following infection were lower than those observed in ferrets or hamsters, and infected guinea pigs did not produce detectable levels of local antibody in their nasal secretions. In addition, high levels of nonspecific inhibitors of hemagglutination were present in guinea pig sera, making measurement of specific HAI antibodies problematic [39].

However, killed vaccine, administered with an adjuvant to naive ferrets, provided partial protection against infection [79]. Thus, immune responses, in the ferret, to vaccination with inactivated virus vaccines against human influenza viruses do not appear to be identical to those seen in humans, since humans do not generally require an adjuvant to achieve protective levels of HAI antibodies. In contrast to the findings with inactivated influenza viruses, immunization with live influenza virus resulted in protection against subsequent challenge [78]. An explanation for this difference may be that in ferrets, influenza infection is primarily an upper respiratory tract infection, and adjuvant is required to elicit higher levels of serum antibody needed to restrict replication of virus in the upper respiratory tract. Several studies have demonstrated that higher levels of serum antibody are required to provide protection against respiratory viruses in the nose of animals than in the lungs [27\u201329].",

Heterosubtypic immunity against influenza has been demonstrated in a number of studies in mice but the precise mechanism of this immunity is not clear [24, 80\u201382].

A statistically significant reduction in respiratory rate was seen following challenge with A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) in cotton rats that had been immunized with either the homologous virus or with a virus of a different subtype, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), 4 weeks earlier, compared to non-immunized animals. This reduction in respiratory rate correlated with a statistically significant reduction in virus titers in the lungs and nasal tissues in immunized animals. Cotton rats that were immunized with the heterosubtypic A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus had the same extent of alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia and airway debris as non-immune, infected animals, and, like the cotton rats that were immunized with homologous virus, they had more severe early peribronchiolitis than was observed during primary infection. This peribronchiolitis could be indicative of a memory response in the heterosubtypic immune animals. However, the heterosubtypic-immune cotton rats had less bronchiolar epithelial damage than those animals immunized with homologous virus.",

In the case of candidate universal vaccines for influenza, new animal models and assays that can measure antibody and cellular responses to viral antigens other than the HA and NA are needed.

These viruses varied for their ability to cause disease and death in BALB/c mice and generally fell into two distinct groups \u2013 those that were highly virulent, and those with low virulence for mice \u2013 and one virus (A/HK/156/97) was of intermediate virulence in two of the studies [101, 102]; however, Gao et al. [100] found this isolate to be one of the most highly virulent in this model. The 50% lethal dose of H5N1 viruses that were highly virulent for mice was 10\u20131,000 times lower than that of low virulence strains, they replicated to titers that were up to 1,000 times higher in the lungs of mice early in the course of infection, and they replicated in extrapulmonary sites, including the brain. Viral antigen was observed by immunohistochemistry in the lungs of mice infected with A/HK/483/97 (H5N1), a highly virulent strain, and A/HK/486/97 (H5N1), a less virulent strain, and was associated with necrotic bronchi. Viral antigen was also observed, in both glial cells and neurons, in the brain of mice infected with the highly virulent influenza A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) virus, a finding also reported by Gao et al. [100]. In addition, Gao et al. reported the presence of viral antigen in cardiac myofibers of mice infected with the highly virulent influenza A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) virus. The ability of the H5N1 viruses to replicate and cause disease and death in mice did not correlate with their ability to kill chickens [102], and the relevance of replication of these viruses in extrapulmonary sites in mice to the disease in humans is not clear, although a general correlation between the level of virulence in mice and the severity and outcome of disease in humans was observed with 11 of 15 viruses evaluated [101]. Dybing and colleagues [103] reported that infection of mice with highly pathogenic H5 AI viruses that were isolated from Scotland [influenza A/ck/Scotland/59 (H5N1)], Italy [influenza A/ck/Italy/1485-330/97 (H5N2)], Queretaro [influenza A/ck/Queretaro/7653-20/95 (H5N1)] and England [influenza A/tk/England/91 (H5N1)], caused little or no disease in BALB/c mice. HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from humans in Asia in 2004 caused weight loss, ruffled fur, listlessness and pronounced leukopenia, and were lethal in mice without prior adaptation, and replicated outside the respiratory tract [104]. In the same study, HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from birds, and a single human isolate, were less virulent for mice.",

They found that two doses of inactivated vaccine were required to elicit HAI antibody responses of a magnitude that would be protective in human influenza in the majority of vaccinated animals, and that the addition of an alum adjuvant resulted in higher levels of HAI antibody and a greater seroconversion rate. These findings generally agreed with the observations made in humans when a similar vaccine was tested in clinical studies: two doses of vaccine were necessary to achieve acceptable levels of antibody, and the addition of adjuvant, in this case MF59 (instead of alum used in the studies in mice), increased the magnitude of the antibody response as well as the seroconversion rate [105\u2013107]. The efficacy of this vaccine in mice was determined by measuring the level of virus replication in the lungs and protection against lethal challenge with an H5N1 isolate that was highly virulent for mice.",

H5N1 vaccine candidates, bearing the modified HA and the NA from various HPAI H5N1 human isolates and the six internal protein genes from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold-adapted (ca) donor virus, were restricted in replication in the lungs of mice compared to the corresponding wild-type virus, were found be immunogenic and conferred protection against challenge with homologous and heterologous wild-type viruses, although two doses of the vaccine virus were required to fully protect mice against replication of homologous wild-type viruses in the lungs [66]. Another live attenuated cold-adapted candidate H5N1 vaccine, a 7:1 reassortant virus which derived the HA from the low pathogenicity virus A/duck/Potsdam/86 (H5N2) and the remaining genes from the A/Leningrad/17/57 (H2N2) cold-adapted virus that is the donor virus for the seasonal live attenuated vaccine used in Russia, was evaluated in mice [112\u2013114]. Only a single dose of this live vaccine virus was evaluated, but similar findings were reported: it was restricted in replication in the respiratory tract of mice and was immunogenic. The ability of the live attenuated H5N2 virus to elicit local IgA antibody responses in nasal washes has been demonstrated in mice. Modest levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected 6 weeks after a single dose of the H5N2 live attenuated vaccine, and the vaccine conferred protection against lethal challenge with a wild-type HPAI H5N1 virus. The predictive value of the mouse model for the evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines is discussed below in the section entitled \u201cClinical Evaluation of Live Attenuated Candidate Vaccines for Pandemic Influenza\u201d.",

[117] reported that intranasal infection of mice with the non-adapted HPAI A/Netherlands/219/2003 H7N7 virus, that was isolated from a fatal human case, resulted in severe illness, as indicated by weight loss, lethargy, ruffled fur, and lethality. The rate of loss in body weight was similar over a range of doses of virus between 3 \u00d7 103 and 3 \u00d7 106 EID50. The virus was detected in the spleen, liver, kidneys and brain, as well as in the lungs of mice. This model was used for the evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate H7 influenza vaccines [117]. A single dose of an ISCOM vaccine and two doses of a subunit vaccine failed to protect mice against lethal infection with the A/NL/219/2003 (H7N7) virus, with one exception. Mice vaccinated with two doses of 1 \u03bcg or 5 \u03bcg ISCOM vaccine exhibited a small temporary loss in body weight but otherwise appeared healthy after challenge. Vaccination with two doses of the ISCOM vaccine resulted in at least a 1,000-fold reduction in virus replication in the lungs, and near-complete reduction of extrapulmonary replication of the challenge virus. However, in all vaccinated mice, virus was still present in the lungs at high titers.",

The influenza A/NL/219/2003 virus replicated to a titer that was more than 1,000-fold higher compared to the titer in the lungs of mice infected with the influenza A/NL/33/2003 virus, and it was isolated from the brain, spleen, liver, and kidney of all infected animals. Influenza A/NL/33/2003 virus was isolated from the brain of only one out of three mice, and was not detected in the other organs examined. Histopathological findings in all mice infected with influenza A/NL/219/2003 virus included necrosis and inflammation throughout the respiratory tract that was pronounced in the trachea and became progressively milder in the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. In contrast, lesions in the respiratory tract were only observed in one out of four mice infected with the influenza A/NL/33/2003 virus, and were characterized as mild to moderate cell necrosis, with neutrophil infiltrates in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Lesions were not observed upon histopathological examination of the brain, heart, spleen, liver or kidneys of mice infected with either virus. Viral antigen expression was limited to the tissues of the respiratory tract in mice infected with either virus, but was more abundant in mice infected with the influenza A/NL/219/2003 virus. Rigoni and colleagues [119] reported that HPAI H7N1 viruses isolated from chickens and ostriches could infect and replicate in mice without adaptation, and were associated with disease signs of varying severity. Bronchitis, tracheitis, alveolitis, and brain lesions were observed in mice infected with three HPAI H7N1 influenza viruses. However, the influenza A/ostrich/2332/00 virus caused more severe lesions and spread more rapidly in the lungs and brain than the other two viruses (influenza A/ostrich/984/00 and influenza A/ck/5093/99) [119].",

In mice, the vaccine virus did not cause weight loss, and was restricted in replication in the lower respiratory tract compared to the low pathogenicity wild-type parent virus and an antigenically related HPAI H7N3 wild-type virus, and it appeared to have delayed replication kinetics in the upper respiratory tract compared to the wild-type parent virus. A single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine virus was immunogenic in mice and provided complete protection against lethality and pulmonary replication following challenge with H7 influenza viruses of the North American lineage. Two doses of vaccine were required to confer protection against H7 influenza viruses of the Eurasian lineage.",

            "text": "Human infections with H9N2 AI viruses were first reported in 1999 [125, 126] and, although the illness in the infected individuals was relatively mild, there is still concern over the pandemic potential of H9 viruses because viruses of this subtype are highly prevalent in birds [127\u2013131]. The pathogenicity of human and avian H9 influenza viruses in mice has been studied by several laboratories, with a view of establishing an animal model that can be used to study strategies for prevention of pandemic influenza, including vaccines and antiviral drugs. Some H9 influenza viruses replicate in the respiratory tract of mice without prior adaptation [128, 132\u2013134], but serial passage of the A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) virus in mice resulted in an increase in the virulence and in the extrapulmonary spread and lethality of this virus in intranasally infected mice [132, 133]. Data from different laboratories that have used the same H9N2 virus to infect mice are not consistent. Some of the factors that can influence the outcome of infection are anesthesia, dose, volume and route of virus administration, and passage history. It is difficult to compare studies when complete information is not provided. For example, in studies reported by Lu et al. [134], the human influenza A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) virus replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice but failed to cause death or signs of disease, significant weight loss or to spread to extrapulmonary sites. However, Leneva et al. [132] reported that infection of mice with this virus resulted in 40% mortality and significant weight loss in the surviving mice. In these discordant studies, mice were anesthetized with CO2 [134] or with metofane [132], were infected by the same route using virus that had been propagated in embryonated eggs, at approximately the same dose (106 EID50), but inoculum volumes used were not stated in either study, so it is not clear why this virus was lethal in one study and not in the other. Similarly, a lethal challenge of mice with the human influenza A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) virus was reported as part of a study to determine the efficacy of an M2 liposome vaccine [135], although this virus did not cause disease or lethality in the hands of other investigators [134, 136, 137]. All laboratories delivered virus intranasally to anesthetized mice. However, in the study reported by Ernst et al. [135], mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine/xylazine, whereas in the other two studies, inhalational anesthesia was used, which may have resulted in a lighter state of anesthesia.",

Fourteen temporally and antigenically diverse H6 AI viruses of various NA subtypes, from both the Eurasian and North American lineages, were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Following intranasal inoculation of 105 TCID50 of virus, replication of varying efficiency was observed in the respiratory tract of mice. Eleven of the 14 viruses replicated in the lower respiratory tract, ten in the upper respiratory tract; only one of the viruses failed to replicate to detectable levels in mice. Higher titers of the viruses were observed in the lungs of mice compared to the nasal turbinates. Two viruses from Hong Kong, A/teal/W312/HK/97 (H6N1) and A/quail/HK/1721-30/99 (H6N1) caused significant weight loss, illness, and death in mice, but their replication appeared to be limited to the respiratory tract. H6 AI viruses that replicated well in the lungs elicited high neutralizing antibody titers in infected mice, but the immunogenicity of H6 viruses did not correlate with their efficiency of replication in the respiratory tract. The cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies was not an accurate predictor of protection. Live attenuated, cold-adapted candidate vaccines were generated from three of the H6 AI viruses studied [146]. Immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccines were evaluated in mice. A single intranasal dose of each vaccine virus elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibody, and fully protected mice against replication of the wild-type parent H6 AI virus in the lower respiratory tract. Cross-reactive antibody titers against heterologous H6 viruses were significantly lower than against the homologous parent virus. A second dose of vaccine in mice boosted the antibody titers, and improved cross-protection against the heterologous H6 AI viruses. As had been seen in the initial studies in mice, the level of neutralizing antibody elicited by the H6 candidate vaccines was a poor predictor of their ability to cross-protect against antigenically distinct H6 AI viruses. A candidate A/teal/HK/97 (H6N1) cold-adapted vaccine elicited the broadest cross-protective response, and this vaccine virus is currently undergoing evaluation in human clinical trials.",

            "text": "The ability of a limited number of AI subtypes to replicate and cause disease in ferrets has been investigated, and not surprisingly, the behavior of H5 subtype viruses has been the most studied. Zitzow and colleagues [147] demonstrated that two H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from human cases of infection in Hong Kong in 1997 were capable of replication not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the brain, spleen and intestines of ferrets. Virus replication was associated with clinical signs of disease such as severe lethargy, sneezing, rhinitis, hind limb paresis and, in some cases, diarrhea, and some H5N1 viruses were lethal to ferrets. However, the hierarchy in the severity of disease seen with the different H5N1 1997 isolates upon infection of mice, was not observed in ferrets: influenza A/HK/483/97 and A/HK/486/97 were equally virulent after intranasal infection of ferrets, whereas the A/HK/483/97 virus was more virulent in mice than the A/HK/486/97 virus was in several studies [100\u2013102, 148]. As with mice, the significance, with respect to humans, of disease signs and the extrapulmonary replication of H5N1 viruses in ferrets is not clear, particularly since, in the same study, Zitzow et al. reported the isolation of a human H3N2 influenza virus from the brain of ferrets following intranasal infection. Similar studies have been conducted using human and avian H5N1 viruses isolated in 2004\u20132005 [104, 149]. Govorkova et al. [149] evaluated four human H5N1 influenza isolates and nine avian H5N1 isolates from Asia from 2004. A wide spectrum of infectivity, severity of disease and lethality was observed in ferrets inoculated with these viruses. The H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and two of the avian isolates caused severe disease in ferrets with some lethality. However, it is difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the behavior of these viruses in this model because of the small numbers of animals used (only two animals per group for all but one of the viruses tested), and the variability in infectivity of the viruses examined. For example, although the influenza A/Vietnam/3046/2004 virus caused severe disease in two out of two the inoculated ferrets, it was lethal in only one animal, and virus was only recovered from the nasal washes. In contrast, the influenza A/Vietnam/3062/2004 virus, which was also lethal in one out of two ferrets inoculated, was recovered from the lungs, brain, spleen, and intestine of these animals. Similarly, Maines et al. [104] evaluated H5N1 isolates from Asia from 2004 using the ferret model. Although the viruses used in this study were different from those used by Govorkova et al. (with the exception of A/Vietnam/1203/2004), similar findings were reported: the human isolates caused severe disease, with some lethality, in ferrets. Again, small numbers of animals were used (three per group for most of the isolates tested) and some variability in infectivity and severity of disease was observed. In the study conducted by Zitzow et al., gross pathological changes observed in ferrets infected with highly virulent HPAI H5N1 viruses included focal areas of redness in the lungs, consolidation of the lungs and rare discoloration of the liver, petechiae on the liver and lesions on the intestines and kidneys [147]. Maines et al. [104] reported the presence of hemorrhage in the adipose tissue surrounding the liver, kidney and bladder in two-thirds of infected ferrets. Histopathological findings in the lungs of infected ferrets included acute bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia with suppurative exudates in the bronchi, bronchioles and adjacent alveolar spaces, prominent epithelial necrosis and marked intraalveolar edema by day 3 p.i., and bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia observed on days 6\u20137 p.i. [104, 147, 149]. Inflammatory changes were also evident in the brain of ferrets infected with highly virulent HPAI H5N1 viruses at days 5\u20136 p.i., including in the glial nodules with perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the brain parenchyma, neuronophagia and lymphocytic infiltrates in the choroid plexus [147, 149]. Viral antigen was observed by immunohistochemistry in neurons in the same areas of the brain as the inflammation [104]. Govorkova et al. [149] reported histopathological changes in the liver, including diffuse vacuolization of the hepatocellular cytoplasm, mononuclear infiltrates, periportal hemorrhage, and hepatocellular necrosis. Generally, the viruses isolated from avian species caused less severe disease than those isolated from humans.",

Inactivated H5N1 vaccines were immunogenic and protective in the ferret model [150, 151]. However, inactivated H5N1 vaccines that were tested in clinical trials were suboptimally immunogenic [109, 110]. The attenuation of cold-adapted live attenuated H5N1 vaccines has been demonstrated in ferrets. These vaccine candidates were also immunogenic and protective against challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 wild-type viruses in ferrets [66]. Protection from lethal H5N1 infection and the level of replication of the challenge virus in the lungs and other tissues are the endpoints used for evaluation of efficacy in this model. Van Riel et al. [152] demonstrated that the pattern of attachment of H5N1 influenza human isolates in the respiratory tract of ferrets was similar to that seen in the human respiratory tract; the virus attached predominantly to type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and nonciliated cuboidal epithelial cells of the terminal bronchioles in the lower respiratory tract and became progressively rarer more proximally, i.e., towards the trachea. This pattern of H5N1 virus attachment, predominantly in the lower respiratory tract, is thought to be related to the distribution of \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors [153]. However, other investigators found that H5N1 influenza viruses were able to infect ex vivo cultures of the human upper respiratory tract, i.e., nasopharyngeal, adenoid and tonsillar tissues, despite the lack of \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors in these tissues [154]. The tropism of H5N1 influenza viruses in the respiratory tract of humans and other species remains equivocal and further studies, in which a number of different isolates are evaluated in larger numbers of animals, are needed.",

Human isolates of highly pathogenic H7N7 influenza viruses replicated to higher titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets than low pathogenicity H7N2 influenza viruses isolated from humans. The H7N7 viruses also replicated in non-respiratory tissues [115]. The H7N7 isolate A/NL/219/2003 caused severe illness, including significant weight loss, caused neurological symptoms and was lethal in 2 out of 3 ferrets inoculated. Another highly pathogenic H7N7 AI virus, A/NL/230/2003, and the low pathogenicity H7N2 viruses evaluated in this study, did not cause severe disease and were not lethal in this model. Joseph et al. [116] demonstrated that the pattern of antigenic relatedness of H7 subtype AI viruses, determined using post-infection ferret sera, was similar to that observed in mice. The ferret model was used to evaluate attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of the H7N3 ca live attenuated vaccine virus [124]. The vaccine virus was restricted in replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and did not replicate to detectable levels in the lungs or in the brain. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of ferrets immunized with a single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine 4 weeks after immunization, and a second dose of vaccine provided a boost in the antibody response. Two doses of vaccine significantly reduced the replication of homologous and heterologous highly pathogenic H7 influenza viruses in the lungs of ferrets and prevented their spread to the brain and the olfactory bulb.",

[155] demonstrated that AI viruses of the H2, H3, H6, H7, and H10 subtypes, as well as an H7N7 virus isolated from a seal, replicated in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, but elicited low or undetectable levels of antibody. None of these AI isolates tested caused any signs of disease in infected ferrets. Replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity of AI viruses of the H6 subtype were evaluated in the ferret model. Following evaluation in the mouse model of infection, four AI viruses of the H6 subtype that replicated to varying degrees in mice were studied in ferrets [145]. As in mice, the viruses replicated to lower titers in the upper respiratory tract than in the lungs, although the difference in titers was much less than in mice (~10-fold lower titers in ferrets vs. 10\u20131,000-fold difference seen in mice). All four viruses replicated to a peak titer of about 107 TCID50/g in ferret lungs, although the peak titer occurred at different timepoints post-infection. Transient weight loss and fever were observed in ferrets infected with the A/teal/HK/97 and A/quail/HK/99 viruses that were lethal in mice, but also in ferrets that received the influenza A/mallard/Alberta/85 (H6N2) virus, which caused no signs of illness in mice. Ferrets infected with influenza A/duck/HK/77 (H6N9) did not exhibit weight loss or fever, but, unlike mock-infected ferrets, they failed to gain weight during the period of observation. Antibody responses elicited by an infection in ferrets generally correlated with those seen in mice, but, as in the mouse model, the antibody responses did not correlate with virus replication. In the ferret model, live attenuated, cold-adapted H6 AI candidate vaccine viruses were attenuated compared to the corresponding wild-type H6 virus. None of the vaccine viruses caused signs of illness in ferrets, nor did they replicate in the lungs. A single intranasal dose of the vaccine viruses elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibodies in ferrets, and, as in mice, conferred complete protection in the lower respiratory tract following wild-type virus challenge. The levels of neutralizing antibody induced in ferrets by these vaccine viruses did not accurately predict the outcome of challenge with heterologous H6 viruses. The H6 AI viruses generally behaved in a similar fashion in ferrets and in mice, but species-specific differences in the cross-reactive antibody responses were observed.",

Clinical signs, including significant elevation in body temperature, decreased activity, conjunctivitis and labored breathing were seen in cats experimentally infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected chicks [10]. Similar disease symptoms were observed in sentinel cats that became infected from being housed with cats that had been infected intratracheally. Illness in contact cats became apparent about 3 days later than in the cats infected via the intratracheal route. Peak viral titers in the throat swabs of the intratracheally infected cats were ~104.5 TCID50/ml, whereas the peak titers observed in nasal swabs ranged from 102.5 to 105.0 TCID50/ml [159]. The virus was also recovered from rectal swabs of cats infected by feeding on infected chicks, but the titers of virus in these samples varied widely. In addition, cats infected through feeding had lesions in the intestines. In animals infected intratracheally or by feeding, the virus was also recovered from extra-pulmonary tissues, most often from the brain, liver, kidney and heart. Infected sentinel cats did not have detectable virus in tissues outside the respiratory tract; however, pathological changes were observed in the adrenal glands in one of the two sentinel cats infected in this manner. These studies demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 viruses are capable of extrapulmonary spread in cats, and can cause severe disease and even death in animals infected intratracheally or by feeding on infected bird carcasses. These observations also raise the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract may serve as a source for HPAI infection in cats.",

Vaccinated animals developed a fever, but it was of a lower grade and of a shorter duration than that observed in the control animals, and shedding of challenge virus occurred in vaccinated animals, but it was for a shorter duration than in the control animals.

The H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in small numbers of volunteers [166]. The vaccine was evaluated at two different dose levels, and two doses were found to be safe and immunogenic in 47\u201355% of subjects.

The reasons for the superior immunogenicity of the H5N2 ca vaccine virus, compared to the H5N1 vaccines based on the A/AA/6/60 ca in these small clinical studies, are not fully understood. It is possible that the donor cold-adapted H2N2 virus used to generate the H5N2 ca vaccine virus is less attenuated than the A/AA/6/60 ca donor virus, resulting in a vaccine virus that replicates more efficiently, however, this cannot be confirmed since replication of the H5N2 ca vaccine virus in humans was not reported. Given the poor predictive value of the mouse and ferret models with respect to the replication and immunogenicity of clade 1 live attenuated H5N1 vaccines in humans [66, 168], it will be interesting to see how the A/Anhui/2/2005 cold-adapted vaccine described by Fan et al.

Maines et al. reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) isolate was highly infectious in the mouse model, with a 50% mouse infectious dose (MID50) of between 100.5 and 101.5 plaque forming units (PFU), but this virus and two other isolates (A/Texas/15/2009 and A/Mexico/4108/2009) were not lethal in mice; whereas Itoh and co-workers reported that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus was lethal in mice at an LD50 of 105.8 PFU, and that mortality was also observed in mice infected with another isolate, WSLH34939 (LD50 of 104.5 PFU). In both studies, weight loss was observed in mice following infection with A/California/04/2009, but the disease was far more severe in the study conducted by Itoh et al. In both studies, the peak virus titer in the lungs at day 3 post-infection was similar (between 105.8 and 107.8 PFU), and virus replication was restricted to the respiratory tract. Higher levels of virus replication and more severe pathological changes were observed in the lungs of mice infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus compared to those inoculated with a recent seasonal human H1N1 influenza virus. Prominent bronchitis and alveolitis, with positive staining for viral antigen were observed on day 3 p.i. in mice infected with A/California/04/2009, with signs of regeneration present by day 6 p.i.

Interim data from human clinical studies demonstrated that a single dose of 7.5 \u03bcg of HA, administered with MF59, did indeed elicit serum antibody responses that were predictive of protection, according to the criteria for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [174]. However, data from recipients of the same vaccine administered without adjuvant were not reported [174]. Interim data from clinical trials of an inactivated pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine suggest that, surprisingly, a single dose of unadjuvanted vaccine is sufficiently immunogenic to meet the criteria established for the licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines [175]. The preliminary data from clinical trials of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine show evidence of immunologic priming to the novel H1N1 virus.

The lungs of ferrets inoculated with the seasonal H1N1 virus A appeared mostly normal, whereas A/California/04/2009-infected ferrets had more severe bronchopneumonia with prominent expression of viral antigen in the peribronchial glands and in a few alveolar cells. Similarly, ferrets inoculated with a pandemic H1N1 isolate from the Netherlands had mild to moderate, multi-focal, necrotizing rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis on day 3 p.i. with viral antigen observed in many cells in the nasal cavity, trachea, bronchus, and bronchioles while the pathologic changes and the presence of viral antigen were limited to the upper respiratory tract and were less extensive, respectively, in ferrets inoculated with seasonal H1N1 influenza [176].

Itoh and colleagues studied the infection of cynomolgus macaques with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus [171]. As with the previous studies of avian H5N1 influenza viruses in this model, multiple routes of inoculation were used to establish infection: animals were inoculated with a total dose of 107.4PFU via the intratracheal, intranasal, ocular and oral routes. Macaques inoculated with the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus experienced a greater increase in body temperature than animals that received a recent seasonal H1N1 virus, but they exhibited no other clinical signs of infection.

This could be particularly problematic for live attenuated AI vaccines, since experience with seasonal live influenza vaccines indicates that serum antibody levels do not correlate with the efficacy of such vaccines. Results from clinical trials conducted so far with live attenuated AI vaccines suggest that the measurement of immune responses other than serum HAI and neutralizing antibody, for example, serum IgA levels in pre-clinical studies, may be of value. Efficacy studies in animal models, although not an absolute requirement, may at least provide evidence that biologically relevant immune responses are elicited by candidate vaccines.",

Such approval requires much more limited testing of the candidate vaccines in animal models. In the European Union, manufacturers are required to submit information on the production and pre-clinical testing of a \u201cmock-up\u201d pandemic vaccine. In the event of a pandemic, a vaccine made in the same way as the mock-up vaccine, but based on the nascent pandemic virus, will be produced and will be subject to limited pre-clinical characterization, including immunogenicity studies in animals on at least one batch of the product [179]. Efficacy studies of the actual pandemic vaccine formulation in animals are not required. However, extensive pre-clinical testing of the vaccine candidate is required for new vaccine modalities and formulations, including formulations of approved vaccines with adjuvants.",

This regulation stipulates that, in cases where efficacy of vaccines in humans cannot be definitively determined, marketing approval for a vaccine may be granted based on \u201cadequate and well-controlled animal studies\u201d, provided the basis for vaccine efficacy is reasonably well understood, and that the animal responds to the vaccine in a manner that is predictive of the response in humans. Studies in more than one animal species would typically be required, unless a single animal model is available that can faithfully predict the efficacy of a vaccine in humans. It is unclear, at this time, whether this rule will eventually be applied to vaccines for pandemic influenza. In any event, it is critical that the predictive value of the available animal models for immunogenicity and efficacy of pandemic influenza vaccines be determined systematically using the same vaccine formulations that are progressing into clinical studies.",

Some animal models are more suitable than others in predicting the attenuation of live virus vaccines, or more closely reflect the human immune response to vaccines. Animal models certainly play a crucial role in the evaluation of influenza vaccines, but the limitations of the models must be taken into account when decisions regarding which vaccine candidates should move forward into clinical trials are made.",

It is critical that the behavior of AI viruses with pandemic potential be characterized in a range of animal models. Even from limited observations, it is clear that replication of AI viruses and their ability to cause disease in animals depends on the host species, and is subtype and even strain specific. To date, the level of replication and the immunogenicity of live attenuated AI candidate vaccine viruses seen in animal models have not accurately predicted the behavior of these vaccine viruses in humans. Therefore, pre-clinical safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from animal studies must be carefully considered in the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines.",
