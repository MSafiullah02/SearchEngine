The translocation of apo B100 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its subsequent assembly into lipoprotein particles is of particular interest as the protein is both very large (relative molecular mass 512,000) and insoluble in water. It has been proposed that apo 8 translocation occurs in discrete stages and is completed post-translationally 1 \u2022 Several sites of arrest of translocation were reported to be present in apo B15 (the Nterminal 15% of the protein). We have re-examined this question by in vitro translation coupled with translocation into microsomes, and find no evidence for transmembrane segments in truncated apo 8 proteins. Translocated apo 817 is strongly associated with the membrane\u00b7 of the ER, being only partially releasable with alkaline carbonate, and remaining bound to the microsomes following disruption with saponin. The efficient binding of short segments of apo 8, despite the absence of transmembrane domains, suggests that apo B is cotranslationally inserted into the inner leaflet of the ER. This will obviate problems caused by the size and insolubility of apo 8100, because the growing hydrophobic protein chains will never exist in a lipid-free form during translocation. From the inner leaflet, apo B in association with membrane-derived lipid can bud into the lumen of the ER to form nascent lipoprotein particles.",

The EMCV-apo B transcripts encode MetAia before the apo B prepeptide sequence, but the extended signal still functions efficiently. Thus, apo B7 and B9 ( Fig. 1 a, b ) increase in size after translation in the presence of microsomes owing to glycosylation 5 , and apo B9 is protected from trypsin digestion when translated with microsomes ( Fig. la) . When apo B7 is translocated in the presence of the competitive glycosylation inhibitor N-acetyl-AsnTyrThr-carboxyamide6, the principal product (unglycosylated apo B7) migrates faster than pre-apo B7, consistent with cleavage of the signal sequence (Fig. lb) . Cleavage (-90%) was confirmed by radiosequencing of processed apo Bl5 (results not shown).",

            "text": "Association of apo B with the ER membrane could either involve amphipathic binding to the inner leaflet, or the presence of transmembrane regions. We observed that after translation in reticulocyte lysates for either 40 min (when protein synthesis is ongoing) or for 90 min at 30 \u00b0C, both apo B 15 and apo BI 7 are protected from trypsin or proteinase K (Fig. 3a, b; and data not shown), thereby excluding the presence of transmembrane domains. To ensure reproducible inactivation of proteinase K , it was necessary to centrifuge the membranes out of the digestion mixture, but this protocol precludes the controls of post-translational addition of microsomes or total disruption with detergent to verify proteinase K susceptibility of apo BI 7. Instead it was shown that apo B 17 becomes susceptible to proteinase K after the membranes are permeabilized with saponin ( Fig. 3b ). Although we did not find transmembrane domains in apo B, we confirmed that E 1 glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein ( Fig. 3c ) 10 . Finally we determined whether generation of transmembrane domains resulted specifically from wheat-germ ribosomes. Reduced expression of some transmembrane domains in reticulocyte lysates relative to wheat-germ lysates has been reported 11 \u2022 12 , although the topology of proteins expressed in mammalian cells is better predicted by translation in reticulocyte lysates 12 . But we find no evidence for transmembrane domains when apo B 15 is translated in wheat-germ lysates and the microsomes are digested with trypsin (results not shown) or proteinase K (Fig. 3d) . Using densitometry to quantitate full-length chains after digestion we find ( 1) 71 % \u00b1 13 s.d . ( n = 9) recovery of apo B17 in reticulocyte lysates with trypsin and (2) 86% \u00b131 s.d. recovery ( n = 7) of apo BI 5 in wheat-germ lysates with proteinase K. In contrast, we find 0% (n = 4) recovery of apo 815 or B 17 in saponin-disrupted microsomes after proteinase K digestion. Although we routinely included the membrane stabilizer tetracaine 13 in digestion mixtures, we cannot detect transmembrane domains when tetracaine is absent but Ca2+ is present (results not shown)1; in contrast, substantially reduced levels of putative intermediates have been observed with tetracaine present (S. L. Chuck and V. R. Lingappa, unpublished), which suggests that the data in ref. 1 may be a result of overdigestion.",

In tracks 6, 0.1 % Triton X-100 (Tx) was included during the digestion. b, Apo 817 was translated in the presence of microsomes and then aliquots were left undigested (tracks 1 and 4) or were digested for 60 min with proteinase K (PrK) (tracks 2, 3) in the presence(3, 4)  or absence (1, 2) of 0.05% saponin (Sa). Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation. The results show that apo 817 is protected from proteinase K if cotranslationally translocated into microsomes, but not if the microsomes are disrupted with saponin during digestion. e, E1 glycoprotein transcripts were t ranslated in reticulocyte lysates in the presence of microsomal membranes and digested with trypsin (tracks 1, 2) or proteinase K (tracks 3, 4) for O min (tracks 1, 3) or 90 min (tracks 2, 4). E1 glycoprotein (E1gp) was cleaved from a protein of apparent M, 23.5K to a major product (FA) of 22K and a minor product (F8) of 19.5K (ref. 10), which migrates here at < 18K. The 22K product is generated by cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of E1gp. The smaller product is generated by cleavage of both the cytoplasmic and luminal domains 1 0 . d, Apo 815 transcripts were translated in wheat-germ lysate in the presence of microsomes for 60 min, and then the membranes were",

Some partial synthesis products are present in all tracks but no new bands are generated by protease digestion. METHODS. Apo 815 capped transcripts were prepared by linearizing construct GB15 with Sa/I and transcribing with T7 polymerase in the presence of 0.5 mM GTP with 5 mM 7-methyl GpppG (Pharmacia), and fractionated on a Sephadex-G25 spin column (Pharmacia). Fractionated wheat germ lysate (Amersham) was reconstituted to 120 mM K+, with a 1 mM mixture of unlabelled amino acids excluding Met. Proteinase K digests were diluted with 2 volumes of 250 mg mI-1 BSA in 0.15 M NaCl with 5 mM PMSF. Membranes were collected in an airfuge and washed 3 times with NaCl solution before dissolving in SDS loading buffer plus 5 mM PMSF for SDS-PAGE. In some instances membranes were disrupted with 0.05% saponin before protease digestion. Proteins were resolved on 8-15% or, for c, on 7-17% SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gradient gels. Subcloning: The 50-nucleotide 5' UTR of human /3-globin containing the natural Nea l site at the first A TG of the coding sequence 20 was synthesized as oligonucleotides with a 5' Sstl site and a 3' Sstll site to enable it to be cloned into the polylinker of plasmid pKS. Pre-apo 815 was constructed by ligation of Neal\" Hindlll (2,279) fragments of cDNA to generate plasmid GB15.",
