            "text": "Tonsils and adenoids are lymphoid organs located at the entrance way to the respiratory and alimentary tracts. Their location makes them ideal as the first line of defense against inhaled and/or ingested viruses and bacteria. The list of respiratory viruses known to cause upper airway infections is long and includes such common agents as adenoviruses (AdV), Boca virus, coronaviruses (CoV), enteroviruses (EV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza viruses (InfV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinoviruses (RV). Each of these viruses along with cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpes viruses (HHV) 6\u20138, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papilloma viruses (HPV), human parvovirus B19 and polyomaviruses (PoV) have been detected in tonsillar and adenoidal tissues of asymptomatic individuals [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. As many as 97% of tonsils and adenoids reportedly contain a detectable virus [7], [8], [13], [18]. Co-infections with multiple types of virus have been observed. Approximately 80% of adenoidal tissues may contain multiple viruses while lower rates have been reported in tonsillar tissue ranging between 59% and 68% [7], [8], [13], [18]. The rate of detection of viruses varies dependent on the diagnostic technique utilized, age of patient, virus type as well as season of year in which specimens were collected. It is almost certain that the number of microbes detected will continue to increase over time with improvements in the diagnostic tools employed. The effects of asymptomatic infections on tonsils and adenoids remain largely unknown.",

The study was open to children undergoing surgical removal of adenoids and/or tonsils for various reasons, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. The tonsils were removed by monopolar cautery by two the surgeons and by the microbipolar technique by the third surgeon. In contrast all three surgeons used curettage to remove the adenoids. Children with craniofacial abnormalities and bleeding disorders were excluded. Data recorded included date of birth, gender, height, weight, BMI, weights of tonsils and adenoids and reason for surgery. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing was a clinical diagnosis; however, the degree of airway obstruction was estimated by the Brodsky scores for the tonsils and percentages of airway obstruction for adenoids. None of the children exhibited symptoms consistent with an acute respiratory illness at the time of surgery.",

Paired t-test was used to assess differences between the number of virus types between tonsils or adenoids. Pearson correlation was used to assess the association between age and total virus number types present.

Adenovirus remains latent predominantly in T lymphocytes while EBV remains latent predominantly in B lymphocytes [11], [23]. Lymphocytes latently infected with adenovirus can evade destruction by internalizing surface receptors recognized by the immune cells of the surveillance system [24]. The infection state of the virus remains unclear but is presumably chronic or latent given the high rate of detection of non-replicating virus and the absence of symptoms [1], [8], [15], [25]. Latency in large DNA human pathogenic viruses has been associated with latency-associated transcripts and other evidence of a different replication state to either symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. Such investigations were beyond the scope of the present study.",

In tonsils, the presence of EBV was associated with higher Brodsky scores and in adenoids, the presence of PIV, CoV, AdV or EBV was associated with greater percentages of airway obstruction. Higher detection rates of viruses in hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids compared to non-hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids from children has been documented in several other reports [13], [21]. The present study provides substantial evidence suggesting that chronic stimulation of both tonsils and adenoids is associated with obstructive airway disease in a quantitative manner. The actual number of different viruses in obstructive tonsils and adenoids remains unknown but is most certainly greater than those identified in the present or previous reports. The current study was limited by the number of microbes tested as well as by the number of children enrolled. Also, the absence of age-matched controls without adenoidal or tonsillar disease makes the interpretation of the findings in this report, as well as in other studies, more complicated. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying the persistence of asymptomatic viral infections in tonsils and adenoids in individuals with and without airway obstruction.",
