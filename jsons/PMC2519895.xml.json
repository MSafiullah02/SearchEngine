Pseudotyped retroviruses containing S protein mutants were first generated using a global site-directed mutagenesis and then Ala-scan of aromatic amino acids in the Trp-rich region to determine the positional importance of each Trp, Phe or Tyr. To restore the aromaticity of Ala-mutants, we performed rescue experiments using a Phe-scan. The results show that global substituted mutants, tri-, tetra- and penta-substitution with Ala (WYF5A, WY4A, and W3A) completely abrogate infectivity, while single- and double-substitution with Ala (W2A-4/6, W2A-4/9, W2A-6/9, W1194A, W1196A, Y1197A, W1199A, and F1202A) substantially decrease infectivity by >90% (Table 3\n). On the other hand, Phe-substituted mutants are able to restore 10\u201325% infectivity comparing to the wild-type (Table 4\n).

The cryoEM structures of HIV and SIV reveal that the Trp-rich region forms the \u201cfeet\u201d of a tripod-like structure of the spike proteins [22], anchoring the legs (HR1 and HR2 regions) firmly on the lipid rafts of viral surface. In the post-fusion state, the two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) form a 6-helix bundle, positioning the fusion peptide closely to the Trp-rich region to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and cell membranes. Because of their similarity in fusion mechanism of SARS-CoV and HIV, we hypothesized that the highly conserved Trp-rich region in SARS-CoV S protein plays a similar role in viral entry as in HIV by anchoring the tripod-like structure of S protein on a lipid rafts-like environment on the viral surface. Such a mechanism of anchoring S protein promotes clustering of S proteins, an effect which facilitates docking of host receptors, and subsequently membrane fusion by merging the cholesterol-enriched microdomains of both virus and host membranes.",

The role of the Trp-rich region in participating in the clustering of gp41 monomer within the HIV-1 envelope has been shown by Saez-Cirion et al. [23]. They reported that the Trp-rich region of EboV glycoprotein predicted to bind the membrane interface, adopted a \u03b1-helical structure. This pre-transmembrane sequence might target membranes inherently prone to destabilization of the membrane. This group also reported that sphingomyelin and cholesterol promote HIV-1 gp41 Trp-rich region surface aggregation and membrane restructuring [24]. Furthermore, Guillen et al. [25] identified three membrane-active regions of SARS-CoV S protein using a 16/18-mer peptide scan; one of them is located in the Trp-rich region. Peptides corresponding to this region exert a dramatic effect on leakage for different model membranes, suggesting that this region might be involved in the promotion of the membrane destabilization required for fusion, as well as in fusion pore formation and enlargement.",

New predictive approaches including computation of interfacial affinity and the corresponding hydrophobic moments also suggest that this region is functionally segmented into two consecutive subdomains: one amphipathic at the N-terminal side and one fully interfacial at the C-terminus [26]. The N-terminal subdomain would extend \u03b1-helices from the preceding carboxyl-terminal heptad repeat (HR2) and provide, at the same time, a hydrophobic-at-interface surface. Saez-Cirion et al. [23] reported that gp41 Trp-rich peptides have the ability to oligomerizes and insert into the viral membrane interface. In our study, mutation of three or more aromatic residues in this region that functions as \u201cfeet\u201d in pre-fusion state would irreversibly change its hydrophobic moments and its ability to anchor stably on the membrane to support the fusion process. Mutation of one or two aromatic amino acid residues in this region partially affects the \u201cfeet\u201d-like conformation and virus infectivity.",

[20], [27], [28], [29], [30] reported that a consensus sequence found in a group of proteins that sequester to cholesterol-rich regions of membranes has the pattern \u2013L/V-(X)(1\u20135)-Y-(X)(1\u20135)-R/K-, in which (X)(1\u20135) represents 1\u20135 residues of any amino acid. This sequence can induce formation of cholesterol-rich domains. The HIV-1 fusion protein gp41 has a LWYIK motif, consistent with this consensus sequence for this protein sequestering into cholesterol-rich domains and promoting membrane fusion. The SARS-CoV S protein Trp-rich region Q Y I K W P W Y V W L G F I I also has a similar motif. Our former data [21] show that lipid rafts are involved in the virus entry, which also supports the notion that the Trp-rich region may interact with lipid rafts in triggering the aggregation of lipid rafts and destabilizing the host cell membrane to promote membrane fusion, furthermore the aromatic amino acid residues in the Trp-rich region play crucial roles in viral infectivity.",
