Eventually, the fall in incidence leads to a fall in prevalence because infections are \u2018lost\u2019 from the population (due to recovery, death or emigration) faster than they are replaced by the spreading of infection. In the longer term, the infectious agent may be able to persist in the population (i.e. become endemic) if there is a high-enough rate of resupply of susceptible individuals due to birth, immigration, recovery from infection (if there is no lasting immunity) or waning of immunity (if applicable); otherwise the infectious agent will go extinct locally.",

A related quantity is the basic reproduction number R\n0,18 which is defined as the mean number of new infections caused by a typical infected individual in a population of wholly susceptible individuals, i.e. R\n0 is what the value of R(t) would be if the population were totally-susceptible. It is important to understand that R(t) is specific to the particular infectious agent in the particular population at the particular time, and can be changed by interventions. R(t) depends upon the average rate of transmission from an infectious individual and the average duration of infectiousness. An epidemic requires that R(t)>1, so that the prevalence of infection increases because more than one new infection arises from the average infected person before that person is \u2018lost\u2019 from the infected population. In the typical epidemic described above, depletion of the \u2018supply\u2019 of susceptible individuals causes R(t) to fall, even though R\n0 does not change. In fact, R(t) falls even as incidence rises; the initial increase in incidence is driven by the increase in prevalence, with the proportionate increase in prevalence being greater than the proportionate reduction in transmission from the average prevalent case, caused by the reduction in the number who remain susceptible.",

Generally, the higher the value of R\n0, the harder an infection will be to control. In a homogeneous population (one where everyone has the same average risk of acquiring and transmitting infection) the relationship between R\n0 and R(t) is R(t) = R\n0\u00d7s where s is the proportion of the population that is susceptible. To prevent an epidemic by vaccination requires that s be reduced so that R(t) <1 (i.e. that s be reduced below 1/R\n0), hence the greater the value of R\n0 the smaller s must be. The critical vaccination threshold is the proportion of the population that must be successfully immunized to prevent an epidemic; for childhood infections such as measles, which have high typical R\n0 values, this is typically >90% or even >95%.",
