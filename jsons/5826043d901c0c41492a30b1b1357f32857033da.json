As industrial, and accompanying residential, development encroaches on the English countryside, gardens become increasingly important as refuges for wildlife, particularly insects. Most gardens are small, some are very large, but collectively they occupy an area of more than 40()0()() ha, more than the area set aside as national parks and nature reserves.

Casual introduction of native plants, i.e. weeds, together with planned planting programmes result in continual addition of new plants, but this is countered by weeding and management decisions as to what to grow, Gardens are therefore maintained in a state of permanent succession, and not only is the resulting plant diversity high, but the composition of the flora changes from year to year. The average gardener demands much from a small patch of land: a display of colourful flowers, a supply of vegetables and other produce, space to sit or for children to play, somewhere to stroll, a pleasing view from the house, a screen from neighbours or traffic, and often a display site for his or her skills and tidiness. This produces, in even the smallest garden, a patchwork of shaded and open places, so close-packed that the garden becomes a system of ecotones, each micro-habitat grading into another on all sides. Consequently, even a small garden can accommodate a wide variety of insects, simply because the garden habitat encompasses a multitude of ecological niches.",

The netting \"roof of the trap is highest at one end where a collecting jar filled with 70% alcohol is attached. Insects flying in through the open sides and striking the central baffle tend to fly upwards, and ultimately fall into the collecting jar at the apex. The trap is particularly suitable for sampling flying insects, such as hoverflies, because it is in operation continuously, day and night, in all weather conditions, and uses no attraetant, capturing only those insects that have independently entered its air space. The trap samples an area of about 2.6 m^ to a height of 1.1m, and therefore removes from the garden only those flying insects that enter 2.9 m-* of air space. This is unlikely to affect the size or composition of the garden fauna; even if insects enter the garden to fill the space created by removing some, both removal and replacement are effectively rand(\u00bbm.",

The larvae, however, vary considerably in their food and feeding places, and hence in their positions in garden food webs. Five categories (derived from Colyer and Hammond 1968) can be recognised: consumers of living roots, bulbs, stems or fungi; predators of aphids and other Homoptera; dwellers in (and presumably feeders on) rotting wood or sap from tree wounds; dwellers in (and hence feeders on) soft, or liquid decaying organic material; and scavengers in the nests of ants, bees or wasps, Members of most groups are probably opportunist feeders: aphid-feeders occasionally attack other insects and each other; larvae associated with tree sap may eat small insects attracted to the sap; and scavengers in Hymenoptera nests occasionally eat live larvae and pupae.

Gardens can obviously accommodate species with aphid-feeding larvae, and to a lesser extent those whose larvae inhabit decaying organic material, bulbs and Hymenoptera nests; but those whose larvae feed on tree sap or rotting wood are less likely to find egg-laying sites. The spatial complexity of gardens is important, for adult females show habitat preferences when egg-laying; for instance, Syrphus ribesii females are more often seen lapping honeydew and laying eggs on aphid-infested plants oi Epilobium angustijolium in the sun than in the shade.",
