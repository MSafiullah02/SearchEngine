            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for COVID-19, a global pandemic with catastrophic consequences for healthcare systems and populations around the world. SARS-CoV-2 was initially described in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. The virus rapidly escalated and on March 11, 2020; the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), the virus responsible for MERS [2]. Following the SARS epidemic, researchers extensively investigated the pathophysiologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection, including the interaction of the virus with the heart and lungs. Based on these studies, researchers believe that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, located on alveolar epithelial cells, serves as a high affinity receptor and co-transporter for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the lungs [3]. Medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), block ACE2 receptors, which may predispose or protect against COVID-19 infection. This editorial summarizes the current scientific evidence surrounding this subject in order to guide clinical practice.",

First, the kidneys secrete renin, which metabolizes angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. Next, the kidneys and lungs secrete ACE, which converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Finally, angiotensin II stimulates vasoconstriction, cardiovascular response, and aldosterone and ADH production; this ultimately increases blood pressure and body fluid volume through sodium, potassium, and free water resorption [3]. ACE2 receptor, a homolog of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) receptor, is a type I transmembrane aminopeptidase with high expression in heart and lung tissue [4], but which is also expressed in the endothelium and kidney (see Fig. 1, illustrating the RAAS activation pathway). Discovered in 2000, ACE2 receptor appears to counter-regulate RAAS activation by degrading angiotensin II [5]. The RAAS system is widely implicated in DM, hypertension, and heart failure. ACEI and ARB drugs, based upon strong evidence of efficacy, are commonly used in the management of hypertension, heart failure, post myocardial infarction care, and to slow progression of renal disease associated with diabetes.",

A recent commentary published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine hypothesizes that the use of ACE2 receptor increasing drugs is at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. ACEI initially inhibits ACE leading to decreased angiotensin I levels, causing a possible negative feedback loop that ultimately upregulates more ACE2 receptor to be able to interact with the decreased angiotensin I substrate available [13] (see Fig. 1.). This ACE2 receptor upregulation results in increased binding sites for SARS-CoV-2, leading to preferential COVID-19 infection. This is particularly observed in patients with diabetes and/or hypertension, since they are usually taking ACEI or ARB [12]. This comment was released before the findings published by Peng et al. [9]. An editorial response by Sommerstein et al. [14], based on the findings by Ferrario et al. showing a 5-fold increase in ACE2 levels with lisinopril and 3-fold increase in ACE2 levels with losartan [15], was published in the British Medical Journal.",

Li et al., for example, proposed that ACEI inhibition of ACE may stimulate a negative feedback (given the lack of angiotensin II, upregulating ACE2 receptors and decreasing overall inflammation [16]). Sun et al. argued that ACEI use im pairs the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin-1 receptor pathway, therefore, impairing the integrity of the ACE2/angiotensin 1\u20137/MAS (MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor). A disruption of the ACE2/angiotensin 1\u20137/MAS pathway could lead to decreased production of ACE2, decreasing chances of SARS-CoV-2 entering the cell [17]. Some RAAS inactivated animal models demonstrate symptom relief in acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, through vasoconstriction mechanisms [17]. Recent findings also demonstrate that patients on the ARB olmesartan had increased secretion of urinary ACE2, likely from an upregulation mechanism, although unclear [18]. Despite this hypothesis of ACE2 upregulation, a causal relationship decreasing mortality has not been demonstrated.",
