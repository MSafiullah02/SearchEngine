While agents have their initial preferences on a series of issues, they may interact with each other, be fully motivated to influence others, and, accordingly, be influenced by others, consequently changing their preferences and ultimately their choices on these issues in the process of decision-making [32]. The influence on preferences or choices is achieved via the exchange and diffusion of information among agents and across issues. The information that agents exchange can be from other agents\u2019 observable (decision-making) behaviors [32] or from others agents\u2019 declared or shared preferences (underlying their choices) [25].",

For example, in international politics, the decision-making process of the United Nations (UN) Security Council entails various influences among member states, including both positive influences among allies and negative influences among opponents. Each member state in the UN Security Council has full motivation to convince and influence other member states\u2019 votes in order to gain desired voting results and maximize its own state interests. Member states in the same alliance usually support each other, therefore positively influencing each other. For instance, the United Kingdom usually casts the same votes as the United States. However, member states from confronting camps usually oppose each other, thereby negatively influencing each other. For instance, the former Soviet Union1 and present-day Russia usually veto the draft resolutions proposed by the United States.",

When an agent is making decisions on a series of issues, it is natural for him/her to refer to his/her own choices regarding the same or similar issues in the past. Namely, an agent\u2019s preferences/choices on later issues are usually dependent on (or affected by) his/her own choices on prior issues. There are both positive and negative dependencies among issues. An agent will positively reference (usually, make the same decision as) his/her satisfactory choices in the past but will negatively reference (usually, make the opposite decision to) his/her regrettable choices from the past. For example, in international politics, the United States always used its veto power on the draft resolutions to punish Israel in the UN Security Council, not only for its own state interests but also for its reputation in the international community and particularly in the mind of its allies (a great power should be constant and trustworthy regarding its attitudes toward critical issues and provide a stable expectation for its allies).",

The Council has made decisions on thousands of draft resolutions since the establishment of the UN. Moreover, there are many draft resolutions frequently addressing the same subject (such as the Israel-Palestine issue, Iraq issue and Syria issue). Usually, the votes of a given member state on later draft resolutions would be affected by (refer to) its own votes on former draft resolutions with the same or similar subjects, which means that there are dependencies (represented as the vertical directed links shown in Fig. 1) among issues (draft resolutions). The typical framework describing the dependency among issues is the CP-nets [2, 3, 18, 36, 38, 39].",

For instance, a vote of China may be influenced by Russia, the United States and some other states at the same time. As such, how do we address the multiple sources of influence and determine the resulting preference or choice, especially in light of contradictive influencing directions (such as a positive influence from Russia and a negative influence from the United States) and diversified influencing weights (such as a stronger influence from a great power and a weaker influence from a small country)?

If you like, you can instantly communicate with others overseas. Keeping in touch with friends who are far away is no longer a problem in the sense of space, time and environment. Thus, current studies in decision-making should typically involve a very large number of agents interacting with each other and making decisions on a series of issues as opposed to restricted cases consisting of a few agents making decisions on a single issue, or a few issues decided by a single agent. In this context, not only should the preference/choice of each single agent for each single issue be discussed, but also the interaction and influence among different agents on different issues should be fully investigated, which makes the study of psychology and behavior of a decision-maker, the mechanisms and dimensions of influence, and the aggregation for collective preference/choice in group decision-making much more complicated.3\n",

Agent 1 is a friend (ally) in the mind of agent 3, thus, agent 1\u2019s preferences/choices on current issue Z and on former issue X produce positive influences (with weights of influence respectively as: 3 and 1) on agent 3\u2019s preference/choice on issue Z. Agent 2 is an enemy (opponent) in the mind of agent 3, thus, agent 2\u2019s preferences/choices on current issue Z and on former issue Y produce negative influences (with weights of influence respectively as: \u22122 and \u22121) on agent 3\u2019s preference/choice on issue Z. Furthermore, agent 3\u2019s preference/choice on current issue Z is influenced by (dependent on) his/her own preferences/choices on former issue X and Y (with weights of influence respectively as: 3 and 4).\n",

What\u2019s more, it is quite common that people will be influenced not only by others (such as friends and allies, or enemies and opponents) surrounding them but also by themselves [25]. The latter oneself will inevitably be influenced by the former oneself, and the weight of one\u2019s own influence is usually positive [25]. Only in some extreme cases, assume a person encounters serious setbacks and totally loses his/her self-confidence, then his/her own influence could change from strong to weak, and even from positive to negative [25]. Such setup of one\u2019s own influence can explain why some people are hard to be influenced by others while some other people are easy to be changed because the former kind of people\u2019s self-influences may have higher weights than the latter [25].",

Though agent 3 faces complicated multiple influences across both agents and issues while making a decision on issue Z, which is the same case as in Example 6, he/she will just follow the influencing decision-making variable with the highest priority of influence (namely, the highest absolute value of the weight of influence here), which is just the preference/choice of himself/herself on former issue Y. This way to address multiple sources of influence is just like ignoring all other influences except the most predominant one, in mathematics, as if resetting all other influencing preferences/choices\u2019 weights to zero (compared with Fig. 4).\n",

In future work, the two approaches could be detailed and improved, and many other promising analytic frameworks and feasible mathematical models could be tried and discussed, particularly considering the case of multiple issues not similar to each other (namely, with different sets of alternatives).\n",
