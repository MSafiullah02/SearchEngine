In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as responsible for the flu syndrome and severe pulmonary complications, the COVID-19. Its origin, still uncertain, is probably related to a mutation in the coronavirus that infects bats, breaking the genetic barrier to adapt to a new species. The original site of transmission was a seafood and live animal market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first cases were linked to individuals who frequented this market. Later, the virus infected family members and, in geometrical progression, nearby provinces, expanding to several countries in all continents.\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n\n",

Estimates indicate that an infected person can transmit the virus to two to four people.\n1\n The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found in the lower respiratory tract of humans, has been identified as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and spread of the virus. The S-glycoprotein on the surface of the coronavirus can bind to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of cells, especially lung cells, rich in ACE2 receptors. The ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the viral genome is released inside the cell, starting the encoding of structural and accessory proteins, with subsequent release of new viruses. This process results in the release of cytokines with intense inflammatory response, leading to respiratory failure, shock, and thromboembolic phenomena related to disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n3\n\n,\n\n4\n\n",
