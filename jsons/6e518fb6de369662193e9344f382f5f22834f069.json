Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specifi c functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and infl ammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specifi c functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM . Finally, we review chemical biology-based experimental approaches for identifying autophagy regulatory pathways that may have implications for the development of therapeutics.",

One of the particularly exciting results from these studies was the identifi cation of autophagy as an unanticipated player in determining risk of IBD. This pathway, long considered to be a relatively nonselective process of bulk cytoplasmic degradation by the lysosome, is thought to have evolutionary roots as a mechanism to maintain metabolic homeostasis in response to decreased nutrient levels [ 1 ] . However, studies over the last 10 years have expanded the functions of autophagy to include roles in organelle clearance, antigen presentation, cell death, development, and the degradation of intracellular pathogens, among others. The role of autophagy in immune-related processes [ 2 -4 ] was particularly unexpected and has served as a guide in many studies seeking to connect human genetics to mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis [ 5 -7 ] .",

We begin by examining the idea of the intestinal mucosa as a physiological system wherein homeostasis is particularly vulnerable to disruptions in autophagy. We then present a basic overview of the molecular events involved in autophagy, followed by discussions of how autophagy may function as a selective process with critical roles in IBD-related immunity. These roles include (1) degradation of intracellular pathogens (xenophagy), (2) mitophagy, (3) antigen presentation, (4) secretion, and (5) infl ammasome regulation. In the cases of xenophagy, mitophagy, and antigen presentation, we present detailed evidence of how autophagy functions in these pathways. Next, we review results from studies of two particularly well-examined CD risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2241880 (ATG16L1, coding variant T300A) and rs13361189 (IRGM). Finally, we discuss approaches from the fi eld of chemical biology that may be used to identify autophagy regulatory pathways with possible implications for therapeutics development.",

One major point of intersection between these processes is their critical importance in the intestinal mucosa. This complex environment must maintain a delicate balance of immune responses, which are continuously stimulated by metabolic stresses and antigens from food. Microbes also play a major role in this milieu, which carries the highest bacterial load in the body. This tissue, therefore, may be especially susceptible to disruption in autophagy, with consequent alteration of homeostatic processes. For example, mice with conditional knockout of Atg7 in intestinal epithelial cells show increased severity of colitis when exposed to the infectious pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , while mice with defi ciency in the core autophagy gene Atg16l1 in hematopoietic cells show increased susceptibility to chemically induced models of colitis [ 20 , 21 ] .",

The membrane elongates and expands to encompass its cargo, eventually fusing to form a double-membrane structure known as an autophagosome. The outer autophagosomal membrane then fuses with the lysosomal membrane, forming a degradative autolysosome. It should be noted that the source of the autophagosomal membrane is still a highly debated topic and the existence of multiple sources cannot be excluded. In the case of the ER, a novel \u03a9 (omega)-shaped vesicle called the omegasome has been identifi ed, which resides on the ER and might precede the appearance of the isolation membrane [ 24 ] .",

The complex is recruited to sites of autophagosome formation, where it likely acts to recruit and disassemble other ATG protein complexes [ 27 -30 ] . ATG9, a transmembrane protein, shuttles between autophagosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and late endosomes in a cycling process that may involve the ULK complex. ATG9 is of special interest to studies of xenophagy, since a recent report suggested that ATG9 is essential for the formation of the isolation membrane in anti-Salmonella autophagy in mouse embryonic fi broblasts (MEFs) [ 31 ] . In mammals, the Vps34 complex is likely required for the recruitment of several autophagy proteins to sites of autophagosome formation. This complex plays a critical role in supplying phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) to the growing autophagosome, where it acts as an essential driving force in autophagosome assembly [ 32 -36 ] . Furthermore, depending on the identity of its protein components, some alternative versions of the Vps34 complex may serve regulatory roles in autophagosome maturation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion [ 32 -34 , 37 -39 ] .",

The ATG12-based conjugation system is initiated by the E1-like ATG7, which activates and transfers ATG12 to the E2-like ATG10. ATG12 is then subsequently conjugated to ATG5 [ 40 , 41 ] . ATG5 and ATG12 then bind with ATG16L1, forming a complex that is essential for autophagosome formation [ 42 ] . In addition to a key role in autophagosome formation, the second ubiquitin-like conjugation system may play additional roles in cargo recognition [ 43 ] . In this system, ATG8 is activated by the E1-like ATG7, is transferred to the E2-like ATG3, and is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through the E3-like action of the ATG5-ATG12 complex. The conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine to ATG8 allows subsequent incorporation of ATG8 into the inner and outer membranes of autophagosomes [ 44 -46 ] . Mammals appear to have two families of ATG8 homologues, known as LC3s and GABARAPs. While all ATG8 homologues can be incorporated into the autophagosomal membrane, the incorporation of LC3s and GABARAPs might occur at different stages, with LC3s acting at the stage of biogenesis and GABARAPs playing a more important role in autophagosome maturation [ 47 ] . Given that ATG8 remains associated with autophagosomes even after their fusion with lysosomes, tracking ATG8 and its homologues allows for localization of autophagosomes. Furthermore, since the inner membranes of autophagosomes are degraded upon formation of autolysosomes, tracking ATG8 enables the measurement of autophagic fl ux as refl ected by ATG8 degradation [ 44 , 45 ] .",

Autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis appear to be transcriptionally coregulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB) [ 52 ] . Overexpression of TFEB induces autophagy, while a block of TFEB expression by RNAi decreases autophagy. Interestingly, TFEB action is implicated in basal as well as starvation-induced autophagy, and therefore TFEB might represent a transcriptional master regulator of the autophagy pathway. Furthermore, translocation of TFEB from the cytosol to the nucleus is strongly enhanced upon removal of nutrients, suggesting that TFEB function is sensitive to nutrients and growth factors. Under fed conditions, phosphorylation on serine 142 of TFEB can be mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and might be suffi cient to retain TFEB in the cytosol. A comprehensive analysis of 51 genes with known functions in the autophagy pathway sheds some light on transcriptional regulation of autophagy in the context of starvation and TFEB function. Strikingly, TFEB-dependent transcription patterns generally correlate with starvation effects, further emphasizing the role of TFEB as an autophagy regulator that can directly or indirectly sense nutritional status [ 52 ] . However, the transcription of the majority of genes is not signifi cantly affected by starvation or TFEB expression levels [ 52 ] , suggesting that transcription factors other than TFEB control the expression of most autophagy and autophagy-related genes, possibly in a nutrient-insensitive fashion.",

The environment of the SCV promotes bacterial survival and replication. The SCV protective niche is established by effectors of two type III secretion systems (T3SSs) encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SP-1 and SP-2). The secretion and activity of T3SS components is highly regulated both temporally and spatially. For example, pH sensing regulates the transition from translocon protein secretion and pore formation to effector secretion [ 53 ] . Once secreted into the host cell, the activity of effectors can be modulated. For example, the T3SS SP-1 effectors SopA, SopE, SptP, and SopB are all ubiquitinated shortly after infection by the host cell machinery [ 54 ] . The phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of SopB regulates several processes that promote internalization and survival of S . Typhimurium, including cytoskeletal rearrangements that promote invasion, SCV biogenesis and maturation, and prosurvival Akt activation [ 54 ] . The ability of SopB to regulate these functions is dependent upon its ubiquitination status [ 54 , 55 ] . A SopB mutant that cannot be ubiquitinated has a number of defects, including a failure to relocalize from the plasma membrane to SCVs, disrupted recruitment of Rab5 to SCVs, and perturbed S . Typhimurium replication [ 54 ] . Thus, ubiquitination-dependent relocalization of SopB to SCVs promotes the establishment of SCVs as a niche environment for replication. This is due in part to the ability of SopB to reduce the net negative charge of PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine lipids on SCV membranes, thereby disrupting maturation and fusion with lysosomes [ 55 ] .",

Therefore, the mechanism of xenophagy, which relies on ubiquitination events on or around intracellular bacteria, might differ from other ubiquitin-dependent selective autophagy events. Interestingly, nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52), in addition to p62, has been implicated in the recognition of ubiquitin-coated invasive bacteria, but not in other forms of selective autophagy [ 57 ] . NDP52 contains a putative LIR motif at its N terminus, can directly bind ubiquitin through a C-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc fi nger, and can form homo-oligomers via its coiled-coil domain [ 57 -59 ] . p62 and NDP52 appear to act cooperatively in the recognition and killing of S .

Upon loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane [ 77 , 78 ] . This step is accompanied by stabilization of PINK1 protein and may involve a membrane potential-dependent block of PINK1 proteolysis by the mitochondrial inner membrane protease presenilin-associated rhomboidlike protein (PARL). This protease is effective in healthy mitochondria but impaired in damaged mitochondria [ 77 , 79 ] . PINK1 then recruits Parkin1 to damaged mitochondria, which results in Parkin1-dependent ubiquitination of some mitochondrial proteins such as voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and mitofusins [ 80 -83 ] . p62 accumulates around ubiquitin-decorated damaged mitochondria and PB1-domain-mediated oligomerization of p62 results in mitochondrial clustering, eventually leading to autophagic degradation of mitochondria [ 80 ] . It should be noted that the mitochondrial ubiquitination event required for mitophagy may involve multiple substrates and/or may be cell type-specifi c, as p62 recruitment to damaged mitochondria and mitophagy is not impaired in VDAC1-defi cient MEFs [ 78 ] . In addition, activating molecule in beclin 1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1), an autophagy-regulating protein initially identifi ed in neuronal cells [ 84 ] , is recruited to damaged mitochondria in a Parkin1-dependent fashion [ 85 ] and knockdown of Ambra1 expression results in impairment of mitophagy. Interestingly, Ambra1 recruitment most likely involves direct binding to Parkin1, but Ambra1 is not a substrate for Parkin1-mediated ubiquitination [ 85 ] . Thus, Parkin1-mediated mitophagy relies at least in part on effects other than ubiquitination.",

MHC class I antigens are derived from proteasomal degradation of cytosolic proteins. In contrast, MHC class II antigens are delivered to the lysosome before transfer to the MHC class II loading compartment and transport to the cell surface. Delivery of these antigens to the lysosome can occur either via endocytosis of protein antigens from the extracellular space or by autophagy of cytoplasmic material [ 86 -88 ] . Autophagy also plays an important role in the presentation of pathogen antigens by dendritic cells (DCs). Mice lacking Atg5 specifi cally in DCs show impaired CD4 + T cell priming following infection with herpes simplex virus, an impairment that is due to a decreased ability of Atg5-defi cient DCs to process and present antigens for presentation on MHC class II molecules [ 89 ] . Furthermore, these cells show delayed fusion of phagosomes to lysosomes. Autophagic degradation may also combine with vesicular traffi cking to facilitate presentation of citrullinated self-peptides by DCs to CD4 + T cells. This fi nding is particularly relevant to IBD, since immune responses against citrullinated self-proteins are associated with autoimmunity [ 90 , 91 ] .",

Patients carrying the CD-associated variant of this gene (ATG16L1 T300A), as well as Atg16l1 hypomorphic (Atg16l1 HM ) mice, were found to show abnormalities in specialized epithelial cells called Paneth cells. These cells play a central role in innate immunity and are an important source of antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine, serving to prevent microbial invasion and control the composition of the gut microfl ora [ 93 ] . ATG16L1 T300A patients and Atg16l1 HM mice exhibit decreased numbers of granules and diffuse staining for lysozyme in their Paneth cells, raising the possibility that autophagy plays a key role in secretion in these cells [ 94 , 95 ] . Supporting this hypothesis, mice lacking Atg5 or Atg7 in intestinal epithelial cells also show Paneth cell defects [ 96 ] . Interestingly, the Paneth cell phenotype in Atg16l1 HM mice can be infl uenced by exposure to a pathogen, since the cellular defects can be eliminated by maintaining mice in a virus-free environment [ 94 ] . Paneth cell defects have also been observed in mice lacking other CD-associated genes, including Nod2 and Xbp1 [ 97 , 98 ] . More recently, a role was reported for Paneth cells in sensing nutrient availability, demonstrating that caloric restriction reduces Paneth cell-specifi c signaling by mTORC1, a regulator of autophagy [ 99 ] . Taken together, these reports suggest that Paneth cell homeostasis and function are intimately linked to autophagy. However, whether autophagy directly regulates vesicular traffi cking and secretion remains unknown, since the molecular mechanisms by which ATG16L1 might regulate these cellular functions are poorly understood.",

The site of the T300A polymorphism is near a WD-repeat domain, which is present in mammalian ATG16L1 but absent in yeast Atg16. This domain is not required for autophagy, consistent with the fi nding that the T300A polymorphism does not affect classical autophagy [ 42 , 67 ] .",

Interestingly, the CD-associated risk allele Another role for autophagy in secretion is suggested by observations in macrophages, in which secretion of active IL-1\u03b2 (as well as active IL-18, not shown) upon LPS stimulation is regulated by autophagy at two levels. In this pathway, loss of ATG16L1 expression is associated with increased cytokine secretion. ( b ) Autophagy can also act as a sensor for bacterial products. In dendritic cells, activation of NOD2 by MDP induces autophagy that leads to MHC class II antigen presentation. This pathway appears to be altered in the context of CD-associated SNPs in ATG16L1 and NOD2 . ( c ) Autophagy plays a role in targeting bacteria and bacterial products for degradation/killing. In one pathway, observed in primary blood mononuclear cells, activation of NOD2 by MDP induces autophagy that leads to production of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and secretion of active IL-1\u03b2. The CD-associated variant ATG16L1 T300A is associated with increased amounts of active IL-1\u03b2 upon MDP stimulation. Autophagy can also directly degrade bacteria. In epithelial cells, bacteria become ubiquitinated and targeted for autophagic degradation in a process that requires the CD-associated genes ATG16L1 and IRGM appears to have different effects on these functions depending on the cell type examined [ 42 , 67 ] . It is perhaps not surprising, then, that T300A has also been associated with defects in antigen presentation increases in IL-1\u03b2 production and abnormalities in Paneth cell secretion in patient samples [ 23 , 95 , 103 ] . In addition, antibacterial autophagy of Salmonella is affected by the presence of the ATG16L1 CD risk allele [ 67 ] , and patients with the T300A allele show increased susceptibility to infection by Helicobacter pylori [ 105 ] . These fi ndings illustrate that disease genes are likely to have specifi c functions in specifi c cell types, and researchers must consider the cell type-and stimulation-specifi c contexts used to examine disease-associated phenotypes.",

Many autophagy and autophagy-related proteins have been characterized, and distinct autophagic complexes with functions in autophagosome assembly and maturation have been identifi ed and analyzed in great detail. The current picture suggests a stepwise process, but the precise regulation of autophagy in changing environmental settings-including fl uctuations in growth factor supply, cytokine signaling, and the presence of pathogens-likely involves complex cross talk between pathway components. Behrends and colleagues recently used an approach which might be described as \"pathway proteomics\" to investigate the network organization of the human autophagy system [ 108 ] . In doing so, they provided a basis for understanding the autophagy network on a protein level. In brief, interaction partners for 32 epitope-tagged stably expressed proteins, representing core autophagy as well as autophagy-related processes, were identifi ed using mass spectrometry following immunoprecipitation of the respective tagged protein. A subset of proteins interacting with primary baits were used as baits in secondary screens, leading to the identifi cation of 751 high-confi dence candidate interactions between a total of 65 baits and an additional 409 proteins. A high coverage of known interactions, a high level of validation (reciprocal immunoprecipitations and in vitro assays), and validation of autophagy functions of network components via RNAi allow for the designation of these results as a true autophagy protein interaction network. Interestingly, different autophagy subnetworks such as the ULK complex, Vps34 complex, ATG8 conjugation system, and PI3P signaling members were revealed to have an underappreciated high level of interconnectivity. Novel interaction partners for the mammalian ATG8 homologues were also identifi ed. These interactors may be shared among all ATG8 homologues, specifi c for LC3 or GABARAP subfamily members or specifi c for individual ATG8 homologues. However, differential cellular abundance of distinct ATG8 homologues could in part account for different effi ciencies with respect to the co-immunoprecipitation of ATG8 interaction partners [ 108 ] . Nevertheless, differences in LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif composition among different ATG8 homologues can affect binding to p62, NBR1 [ 109 ] , and possibly control differential requirements of LC3 and GABARAP subfamily members in early or late phases of autophagosome biogenesis [ 47 ] . In addition, it will be interesting to see if some of the novel ATG8 interactors might function as receptors for certain types of selective autophagy. Good candidates might be recovered by a comparison of ATG8 interactors identifi ed by these proteomics studies and a list of proteins predicted to combine LIR and ubiquitin-binding motifs (Kay Hofmann, unpublished data in [ 110 ] ).",

L-NAME triggers functional autophagy in a variety of cell types as measured by LC3 processing, the accumulation of RFP-LC3 puncta, and the ATG5-dependent clearance of mutant huntingtin aggregates [ 118 ] . While NOS inhibitors such as L-NAME decrease NO, complementary experiments to increase NO levels using NO donors and NO synthase overexpression revealed an inhibitory role for NO in autophagy [ 118 ] . The MOA of NO was found to involve two different mechanisms of inhibiting autophagy. First, S-nitrosylation of JNK1 impairs phosphorylation of BCL2, leading to increased BCL2-belin 1 interaction. Second, S-nitrosylation of IKK\u03b2 promotes the TSC2-dependent activation of mTORC1 [ 118 ] .",

Mitochondrial stress mediated by rotenone, a small molecule that inhibits complex I in the electron transport chain, led to mitophagy that was facilitated by HMGB1 and its transcriptional target HSPB1. HMGB1 and HSPB1 were found to control mitochondrial homeostasis, as knockdown of either HMGB1 or HSPB1 resulted in perturbed morphology, glycolysis, ATP production, and mitochondrial fragmentation [ 51 , 119 ] . Furthermore, rotenone-induced mitophagy was disrupted by cytochalasin D, suggesting a role for the actin cytoskeleton in HMGB1-HSPB1-mediated mitophagy [ 51 ] .",

To gain insight into developing VPS34 selective inhibitors, the structures of VPS34 in complexes with 3-MA, PIK-90, PIK-93, and PI103 were solved [ 122 ] . By employing structure-based design, Miller and colleagues were able to synthesize PT210, an analog of PIK-93, with tenfold more selectivity for VPS34 than for class I p110\u03b3 [ 122 ] . Improved VPS34 inhibitors will be useful to probe the role of VPS34 in autophagy with more selectivity and without confounding effects of class I p110\u03b3 inhibition.",

In particular, studies of the microbiome may be critically important in understanding the relationship between xenophagy, immunity, and IBD.
