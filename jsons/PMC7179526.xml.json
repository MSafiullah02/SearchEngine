By the time the scientific community was alerted, the epidemiological data suggested that the virus had already spread to other regions of mainland China, as well as foreign cities with close transport links to the original epicenter [2]. The world initially answered by divergent responses. Two months on, we are experiencing a devastating pandemic with local outbreaks across all continents.",

It makes perfect sense to recommend to abstain from use of public transport and to use individual transport to and from dialysis facilities. However, not all patients have the capacities to drive themselves. Some rely on relatives, while others (e.g., the majority in most Belgium and Italian units) rely on shared organized transport. We analyzed individual patient's transportation means case-by-case. We motivated all patients to use private transportation as much as possible. For those relying on shared transport, we reduced the number of patients per vehicle. Those with proven infections were excluded from shared transport. Patients tend to arrive in groups, as the dialysis units typically have a number of fixed time slots. We therefore adapted the waiting room. Chairs were put 1.5-2 meters apart, thus extending from the waiting area into the hallways. Patients were asked not to close in on each other. Although center practices may differ, in our units surgical masks are used during connection of the dialysis tubing to the arteriovenous fistula, loop graft, or tunneled central line. Patients were asked not to remove the surgical masks during the dialysis procedure, and to keep their masks for transport to and from the unit. Drivers of organized transport were instructed not to transfer patients, unless masks were worn. Adherence to this was excellent. Further logistics was implemented where possible: patients coming with shared transportation where located in the same area of the dialysis center and treated by the same nurse(s) in order to eventually make possible to trace contacts of patients becoming positive.",

The goal is to detect possible cases early, preferably outside of the dialysis ward, and to isolate proven cases from the other dialysis patients. Suspicion may arise at 3 different moments (in yellow). Ambulatory patients (Left yellow diamond) are stimulated to proactively communicate with the dialysis unit as soon as they have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (coughing, shortness of breath, fever, unusual abdominal complaints, etc.). We aim to have a diagnostic workup as soon as possible, preferably via the general practitioner, or, if not possible, via a scheduled visit to the emergency room. Second, we triage patients upon arrival at the dialysis unit (middle yellow diamond). Temperature is taken from all patients upon arrival. We use a rule-in strategy (i.e., temperature above 38\u00b0C equals suspected case, whereas normal body temperature does not rule out COVID-19). Suspected cases are deviated toward the emergency room. For those patients, we also take an electrolyte panel to see whether dialysis is immediately needed, or that this can be postponed until the results of the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction and computer-aided tomography of the chest are known. Finally (right yellow diamond), we scrutinize patients during stay on the dialysis ward. Temperature is taken from all patients multiple times during dialysis. In case we have identified a maintenance dialysis patient as being infected by SARS-CoV-2, we consider the clinical condition (stable enough to be treated as ambulatory patient), home situation (alone, or with vulnerable household contacts?), transportation means (possibility of organized isolated transport). If possible, we opt for continuation of ambulatory care. If not, patients are hospitalized based upon clinical needs on a regular COVID-19 ward, or the intensive care unit.
