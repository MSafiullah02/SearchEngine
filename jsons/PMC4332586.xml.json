Flaviviruses are small, single stranded 5\u2032 capped RNA viruses with genomes of approximately 11 kb in length. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein which is co-translationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins C, prM and E and eight nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B and NS5) (Lindenbach et al., 2007). An uncapped negative-strand copy of the genomic RNA is generated early in the replication cycle, which is used as a template for synthesizing 5\u2032 capped positive strand genomes late in infection that support further protein production, interfere with cellular processes, or are packaged into virions (Hussain et al., 2011, Moon et al., 2012, Silva et al., 2010).",

Invaginations of the ER membrane form structures referred to as vesicle packets or replication compartments in which NS3 and NS5 replication complexes assemble to replicate positive strand viral RNAs (Chu and Westaway, 1992, Gillespie et al., 2010). The interior of the replication compartments is contiguous with the cytoplasm and has generally been thought to be a reducing environment. The outer surface of the replication compartments is exposed to the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen (Csala et al., 2010). The cytoplasm is considered to be a reducing environment, and cellular proteins such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase are responsible for keeping the cytoplasm from becoming too oxidizing and forming aberrant disulfide bonds, although disulfide bonds can form in some instances (Saaranen and Ruddock, 2012). Oxidative stress occurs when insults to the ER, such as induction of the unfolded protein response during infection or disruption of ER membrane integrity, causes an imbalance of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as oxygen ions and peroxides between the ER and cytoplasm. Maintaining this homeostatic balance between the oxidizing ER and reducing cytoplasm is critical for the well-being of the cell, and oxidative stress or changes in cellular redox conditions can lead to cell death due to damage of cytoplasmic components and induction of apoptosis.",

Several studies have demonstrated that modulating oxidative stress can alter flavivirus replication. Treatment of infected cells with antioxidants to relieve oxidative stress in mammals or mosquitoes appears to improve disease outcomes (Chen et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2011, Nazmi et al., 2010, Pan et al., 2012). Conversely, oxidation by the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) attenuates infection and appears to suppress negative strand RNA synthesis in vitro (Charnsilpa et al., 2005, Takhampunya et al., 2006).

We observed that oxidative stress positively affects viral RNA replication. Conversely, we demonstrate that antioxidant treatment can significantly impair viral RNA replication and alters the amount of capped viral RNA present in cells. Oxidation significantly enhances the guanylyltransferase activity of the flavivirus NS5 RNA capping enzyme which appears to be partially attributable to cysteine residues and disulfide bond formation in the capping enzyme. Oxidation of the conserved methionine residue Met 219 also appears to be involved in modulating NS5 guanylyltransferase activity in vitro and during viral replication. Alphavirus replication also showed reduced viral replication in the presence of antioxidant and enhanced alphavirus nsP1 capping enzyme activity in the presence of oxidizing agent. These findings suggest that positive sense RNA viruses may use oxidative stress during infection to help regulate their genomic RNA replication.",

At 72 h post infection we collected media and determined viral titers using plaque assays (Fig. 1C).

After 48 h of treatment with different concentrations of BHA, Renilla luciferase expression from the DENV-2 replicon was assessed as a measure of DENV-2 RNA replication. We multiplexed these assays with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability system to monitor cellular viability and ensure that changes in Renilla luciferase activity were not due to BHA toxicity (Stahla-Beek et al., 2012). BHA treatment reduced DENV-2 replicon luciferase signal dramatically at 200 \u03bcM BHA, indicating that BHA treatment interfered with viral RNA replication (Fig. 1D). Importantly, we observed minimal cell toxicity with BHA concentrations less than 400 \u03bcM (EC50=150 \u03bcM; CC50=420 \u03bcM; therapeutic index=2.8), demonstrating that BHA-mediated changes in replicon signal at concentrations less that 400 \u03bcM were not directly caused by BHA toxicity. We therefore used 200 \u03bcM BHA for the remaining flavivirus cell culture experiments because that concentration showed about 90% reduction in viral replication while not negatively affecting cell viability compared to controls.",

RNA was extracted from infected cells and positive and negative strand RNA levels were quantified using a KUNV RNA strand-specific qRT-PCR protocol (Ambrose and Mackenzie, 2013). In accordance with our previous findings that viral replication was diminished upon BHA treatment, we found that the overall levels of both positive and negative strands of KUNV RNA were lower upon BHA treatment. Average positive strand RNA values were 6.6\u00d7105 and 8\u00d7104\n PFU equivalents/ml for DMSO and BHA treated samples, respectively. Average negative strand RNA values were 2.9\u00d7104 and 1.3\u00d7103\n PFU equivalents/ml for DMSO and BHA treated samples, respectively. We observed that the positive-to-negative strand RNA ratio was approximately 24:1 in DMSO treated samples, whereas treating cells with 200 \u03bcM BHA consistently reduced the ratio to approximately 5:1 (\nFig. 2A). These data indicated that BHA treatment significantly reduced the abundance of viral positive strand RNA as compared to negative strand RNA.",

We treated purified wildtype DENV-2 NS5 capping enzyme with H2O2 and assessed the proportion of methionine sulfoxide and methionine sulfone produced by Orbitrap mass spectrometry. We observed that treatment with H2O2 increased the amount of both methionine sulfoxide and sulfone species present on purified protein (\nFig. 5A), indicating that oxidation could induce the formation of each of these species. We then tested the effects of Met219 oxidation on guanylyltransferase activation using mutational analysis. Met219 was mutated to Ile (mimicking non-oxidized methionine), Gln (mimicking hemi-oxidized methionine sulfoxide), or Glu (mimicking fully oxidized methionine sulfone) as previously described (Drazic et al., 2013). Each mutant displayed approximately wild-type levels of guanylyltransferase activity in the absence of H2O2, but treatment with H2O2 resulted in attenuated activation with Met219Ile and hyperactive activation with Met219Glu (Fig. 5B).

To address this question we determined if blocking oxidative stress with BHA affected the replication of Sindbis virus (a prototypical alphavirus). Treatment of BHK cells infected with a luciferase-expressing Sindbis virus (SINV) with increasing amounts of BHA resulted in a significant reduction of luciferase signal indicative of repressed SINV propagation (\nFig. 6A). To ensure that this effect was not a result of a non-specific inhibition of luciferase activity by BHA, we also infected BHK cells with an mCherry-expressing SINV treated with either the oxidant H2O2 or the reducing agent BHA and observed a significant reduction of mCherry fluorescence in each case (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that alphavirus replication is also sensitive to oxidative stress conditions similar to flaviviruses and that a sensitive oxidation balance is required for efficient viral replication. We then examined if the activity of the alphavirus RNA capping enzyme nsP1 is enhanced under oxidizing conditions in a similar manner as the flavivirus NS5 protein. We expressed and purified an N-terminal His-tagged nsP1 protein from the related alphavirus Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus. Incubation of the VEE nsP1 protein with GTP results in the formation of the guanylated intermediate as seen with NS5, demonstrating that VEE nsP1 has guanylyltransferase activity (Fig. 6C). To determine if the guanylyltransferase activity of nsP1 could be affected by oxidation, we monitored nsP1 activity in the presence of increasing levels of the oxidant diamide. Increasing diamide concentrations resulted in increased nsP1 guanylation activity, indicating that VEE nsP1 is sensitive to oxidative conditions and that alphavirus RNA capping may also be responsive to oxidative stress during infection.",

We present data indicating that antioxidant treatment can significantly reduce viral RNA replication and that antioxidant treatment preferentially reduces positive strand RNA synthesis during infection. We show that antioxidant treatment can alter the amount of capped positive strand viral RNAs whereas cellular mRNAs are unaffected, indicating that antioxidant treatment specifically interferes with viral RNA cap formation. Biochemical analysis of the effect of oxidation on the flavivirus NS5 capping enzyme demonstrated that oxidation significantly increases the guanylyltransferase activity of NS5, and our data indicate that the increase in activity may be at least partially attributable to disulfide-bond mediated protein dimerization and oxidation of a conserved methionine residue within the NS5 capping enzyme. Finally, we found that replication of alphaviruses also appears to be sensitive to oxidation and that the alphavirus RNA capping enzyme activity is enhanced by oxidation.",

This raises the question of why oxidative stress would be useful to viruses as means to help regulate viral RNA replication. Our hypothesis is that using oxidative conditions to control RNA capping and positive strand RNA synthesis provides a mechanism to temporally control the RNA replication cycle. During flavivirus infection, negative strand RNA synthesis occurs early after entry of the viral genome into cells and is not thought to occur within membranous replication compartments. The cytoplasmic environment would be reducing at this point and based on our data RNA capping would be minimal. It has previously been reported that treatment of cells and in vitro RNA replication assays with the oxidant SNAP to produce nitric oxide reduces negative strand DENV-2 RNA replication (Charnsilpa et al., 2005, Takhampunya et al., 2006), indicating that negative strand synthesis is more active in a reducing environment than an oxidizing environment. Therefore, limiting oxidative stress with antioxidants will likely block positive strand RNA synthesis and bias replication towards negative strand synthesis. These effects would manifest as changes in the ratio of RNA species produced during infection. We observed that treatment of infected cells with BHA reduced the levels of both positive and negative strand RNAs, but positive strand RNA accumulation was affected to a greater extent than negative strand accumulation. As viral RNA replication is cyclic and newly synthesized positive strand RNAs serve as templates for synthesis of the next round of negative strand RNAs, the change in proportions of positive strand capped RNAs suggests that blocking oxidative stress interferes with positive strand RNA synthesis and RNA capping, which corresponds well with results of our in vitro assays.",

The prevailing rationale for forming these membranous replication compartments is protection of their dsRNA intermediates from cellular antiviral defense mechanisms such as Toll-like receptors and RNAi. Formation of these replication compartments would also provide a unique microenvironment that the virus could modulate during the course of infection. Once the replication compartments are formed, reactive oxygen species could permeate the replication compartment from the ER lumen and modify viral replication enzymes (either by forming disulfide bonds or inducing methionine oxidation) and/or lipids within the replication compartment. Therefore, in our current model, a reducing environment early in infection biases towards negative strand RNA synthesis whereas increasing cytoplasmic oxidation later in infection biases replication towards positive strand synthesis.",

            "text": "There are several possibilities for how oxidation affects viral RNA replication. Oxidative activation of the NS5 guanylyltransferase is reminiscent of an oxidative switch, where redox sensitive cytoplasmic proteins are activated by ROS-mediated oxidation of amino acid residues. Recent examples of oxidative activation of enzyme include methionine oxidation of the Escherichia coli HypT transcription factor (Drazic et al., 2013) and activation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase, which is activated upon oxidative stress by ROS-induced disulfide-bonded dimers (Guo et al., 2010). The reduction in oxidative activation observed with the NS5 Cys140 mutant suggests that flaviviruses may use cysteine oxidation and disulfide-bond mediated dimerization as a mechanism to activate their enzymes. The molecular architecture of the flavivirus RNA replication complex within the membranous replication compartments is not yet known, but a potential consequence of disulfide bond formation within or between replication proteins could be the stabilization of the RNA replication complex as a whole. Although our data support the hypothesis that disulfide bond formation is likely contributing to enhanced viral RNA capping rates, the Cys140S mutant DENV-2 NS5 protein showed reduced but not complete oxidative activation as compared to wildtype NS5 protein, indicating that other mechanisms may be involved in the process. Oxidation of NS5 Met219 appears to enhance guanylation activity as demonstrated by decreased in vitro activity with the Met219Ile mutant and increased activity with the Met219Glu mutation. Mutating M219 to either Ile or Glu completely disrupts replication, whereas mutating M219 to Gln partially restores replication, suggesting that the Ile mutation biases towards negative strand synthesis while the Glu mutation biases towards positive strand synthesis. These data correlate well with the cyclic nature of viral RNA replication, as a defect in one part of RNA replication will adversely affect the other parts. If the Met219Ile mutant is strongly biased towards negative strand synthesis, positive strand synthesis would not be able to occur. Met219Glu biasing towards positive strand synthesis may inhibit negative strand synthesis. In either case the RNA replication cycle is aborted. Met219Gln, which shows similar oxidative activation as wild-type protein, may be able to switch between negative and positive strand synthesis more effectively than the Ile and Glu mutants and allow the replication cycle proceed, albeit less efficiently than the wild-type protein. These data suggest that modulating the oxidation status of Met219 may significantly contribute to the flavivirus RNA replication cycle. Methionine sulfone has a similar structure to a phosphorylated residue, and it is possible that Met219 sulfone (and Met219Glu) act like a phosphorylation event that alters protein conformation and alters NS5 enzymatic function. Using this logic Met219Ile would be analogous to an un-modified residue and Met219Gln would be analogous to a partially phosphorylated residue. Therefore, methionine oxidation could act as a redox sensitive switch that alters NS5 enzymatic activity as a function of oxidation status. We are currently pursuing experiments to ascertain the oxidation status of Met219 and other residues during infection by mass spectrometry to better understand the kinetics of the process.",

The flavivirus NS5 polymerase contains a conserved cysteine pair at Cys449 and Cys451 with a very similar structure to the CxxC redox switch found in thioredoxin (Andersen et al., 1997). Additionally, a disulfide bond is observed between conserved residues Cys733 and Cys852 in the WNV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) crystal structure near the GDD active site loop (Malet et al., 2007), suggesting that disulfide bonding could take place within the NS5 RdRP protein and affect enzymatic activity. The effects of these potential disulfide bonds within NS5 on viral RNA replication have not yet been assessed. We also speculate that part of the effect on viral RNA replication observed with BHA treatment is due to changes in disulfide bonding within NS1, which is a luminal ER protein that contains several disulfide bonds and is known to be involved in RNA replication (Blitvich et al., 2001, Youn et al., 2013). However, our data demonstrates that oxidation directly affects the function of the NS5 RNA capping enzyme, so the effect of oxidation on viral replication appears to be complex and proteins other than just NS1 appear to be sensitive to oxidative conditions. We are currently examining how antioxidant treatment affects NS1 localization and disulfide bond formation to better define the effect of NS1 oxidation status on viral RNA replication.",

Experiments to examine if disulfide bonds are formed within and between flavivirus and alphavirus nonstructural proteins during replication will be critical for further definition of the effects of oxidation on flavivirus RNA replication. Methionine oxidation during viral infection has also not been examined and represents a new line of inquiry into how changing intracellular conditions affect viral RNA replication. There are, however, several technical hurdles in assessing the status of methionine oxidation in proteins isolated from the cell. Simple lysis of the cell or disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum can lead to methionine residues becoming non-specifically oxidized during purification, and methionine sulfoxide is routinely observed during mass spectrometry analysis due to oxidation during ionization (Morand et al., 1993), complicating the identification of intracellular oxidation events. Additionally, only a small fraction of total NS5 produced during infection is thought to be found in positive strand RNA replication complexes, and the remaining NS5 protein is present in the cytoplasm interacting with cellular proteins (Fischl and Bartenschlager, 2011, Khadka et al., 2011) or is in some cases translocated to the nucleus (Pryor et al., 2007). Late in infection viral polyprotein translation is ramped up to increase the amount of structural proteins available for virion formation, and the nonstructural proteins are produced in excess. Therefore the challenge becomes purifying replication complex-associated NS5 in a manner that maintains natural disulfide bonds or methionine oxidation. We are currently in the process of developing protocols to determine the oxidation status of flavivirus non-structural proteins during infection.",

            "text": "How do flaviviruses induce oxidative stress during infection? There is currently no definitive data on this topic, but several tantalizing possibilities exist. Japanese Encephalitis virus infection down-regulates thioredoxin expression (Yang et al., 2010), which would increase cytoplasmic oxidation and interfere with homeostatic redox balance during infection. Dengue virus infection can induce autophagy, which is used to support virus-induced membrane remodeling (McLean et al., 2011). Autophagy can induce a release of ROS, although this may not be a common mechanism, as WNV does not appear to utilize autophagy during replication (Vandergaast and Fredericksen, 2012). An interesting candidate for inducing oxidative stress is NS2A. NS2A is a transmembrane ER protein and is involved in RNA replication and evasion of the interferon response (Jones et al., 2005, Mu\u00f1oz-Jordan et al., 2003). NS2A is partially responsible for the cytopathic effect produced during viral infection (Rossi et al., 2007). Furthermore, NS2A can induce interferon-independent apoptosis (Melian et al., 2013), and oxidative stress is well known to induce apoptosis. Two cell-adapted mutants in the NS2A protein, D73H and M108K, increase cellular viability and reduce RNA replication during infection (Rossi et al., 2007). A recent topology study of NS2A localizes D73H and M108K to transmembrane regions of NS2A (Xie et al., 2013), which raises the possibility that NS2A possesses channel or pore-like activity that allows ROS into the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. Indeed, NS2A possesses pore-like activity when expressed in E. coli (Chang et al., 1999). These results support the hypothesis that NS2A could alter the cellular redox balance late in infection and support a switch from negative strand to positive strand RNA synthesis.",

Many RNA viruses replicate their RNA on modified intracellular membranes with different environmental conditions on either side, and our findings with the flavivirus and alphavirus families may have broad implications for many different types of positive strand RNA viruses. Further analysis of how RNA viruses use oxidation and other environmental conditions to control RNA replication will help increase our understanding of how these pathogens usurp cellular resources to control the replication of their genomes and provide novel points of intervention that may be exploited for antiviral or vaccine development.",

West Nile virus (subtype Kunjin) and luciferase expressing Sindbis virus (Steel et al., 2011) were used for viral infection studies. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and DMSO were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); an equal volume of DMSO was used as a control in experiments with BHA. KUNV RNA was collected from culture media and extracted using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). KUNV plaque assays and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assays (qRT-PCR) were performed as described (Stahla-Beek et al., 2012). Strand-specific qRT-PCR was performed using the protocol described by Youn et al. (2013). Dengue virus type 2 replicon assays were performed using persistent DENV-2 replicon cells expressing Renilla luciferase (Whitby et al., 2005). Renilla luciferase activity and cellular viability were determined using Viviren Live Cell Renilla Luciferase substrate and CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability Assay (Promega), respectively, on a Victor X5 Multi-Mode plate reader as previously described (Stahla-Beek et al., 2012, Whitby et al., 2005).

Mutant West Nile virus replicon plasmids that express firefly luciferase as a function of viral positive strand RNA abundance were transfected into BHK cells, and luciferase activity was determined 24 h later on a Victor X5 platereader. A pairwise t test with Bonferroni correction yielded a significant difference for each mutant compared to the wild type with p<0.001 in each case. Additionally, each mutant was significantly different than M219Q with p<0.001. (n=3).",

BHK cells treated with the indicated concentrations of BHA were infected with firefly luciferase expressing Sindbis virus for 24 h. Firefly luciferase activity was detected in infected cell lysates on a Victor X5 platereader as a measure of viral propagation (n=3). (B) Oxidants and antioxidants agents alter Sindbis virus mediated mCherry expression. BHK cells were treated with DMSO, 200 \u03bcM BHA, or 200 \u03bcM H2O2 and infected with mCherry expressing Sindbis virus. At 24 h post infection fluorescent images were collected. (C) Alphavirus nsP1 guanylyltransferase is activated by oxidant treatment. 3 \u03bcM recombinant VEEV nsP1 protein was incubated with 1 \u03bcM GTP-ATTO 680 in the presence of the indicated concentration of diamide for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels. A representative gel is shown. (n=3).",
