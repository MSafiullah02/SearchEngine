Besides the planning of intensive care resources, the lack of evidence-based therapy options is a particular problem for the treating physicians. General statements on the typical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be made reliably at present. Disease patterns are unspecific, diverse, and vary widely, from asymptomatic courses to severe complications, such as pneumonia with lung failure, cardiovascular and cerebral manifestations, and ultimately death. Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath as well as neurological and cardiac manifestations [1] . Risk groups are mainly older people (with a steadily increasing risk of severe courses from above 50-60 years of age), smokers, and patients with certain preexisting conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and weakened immune system [2, 3] ). Therefore, standardized and coordinated data collection on a large scale is of pivotal importance to learn about the natural course of the disease, to accelerate knowledge on the role of preexisting comorbidities in the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify factors associated with outcomes.",

We look forward to obtaining additional data on the short-and mid-term course of the disease with prospective follow-ups of hospital survivors in the COVID-19-RLP as well as in the CA-PACITY-COVID registries with specific focus on cardiovascular and neurological outcomes. COVID-19-RLP in addition will also collect data on the yet-unknown consequences for mental health and the psychosocial outcomes of survivors of COVID-19.",
