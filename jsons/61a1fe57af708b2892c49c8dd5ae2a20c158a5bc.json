Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by an interval from the day SARS-CoV-2 positive confirmed to the day SARS-CoV-2 returned to negative in these 137 COVID-19 patients. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. Findings The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range: 4 days ~ 45 days) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.658, p = 0.017], not severe patient (HR = 0.653, p = 0.076), higher count of lymphocytes (HR = 1.464, p = 0.033), eosinophils (HR = 1.514, p = 0.020) and CD8+ T cells (HR=1.745, p=0.033), and lower IL-6 (HR = 0.664, p = 0.036) and IL-10 (HR = 0.631, p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis with covariables adjusted results showed that the count of CD8+ T cells (HR=2.376, p=0.114) was a predominant risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration. Interpretation Our findings firstly provided early laboratory parameters such as count of CD8+ T cells, as risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which have significance in control and prevention of the disease.",

Importantly, dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in asymptomatic patients has been reported to be similar to that in the symptomatic patients [13] . In this scenario, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration could have importance for evaluation of transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. In this study, our findings revealed that COVID-19 patient characteristics such as age, disease severity, count of total lymphocyte, CD8+ T cells and eosinophils, levels of cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were markedly related to the viral positivity duration. Host antiviral immune status including immune cells and cytokines can play critical roles in virus clearance and outcome of infectious diseases [14] . Immune cells CD8+ T cells and eosinophils have been reported to be critical for viral clearance in acute infections such as coronavirus [15, 16] . As our findings revealed, count of CD8+ T cells at early stage of the COVID-19 is a predominant risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration, which is in line with a study by Shin et al. that extraordinarily high frequencies of MERS-CoVreactive CD8+ T cells were observed in most of the MERS patients at the acute stage prior to the detection of humoral and CD4+ T cell responses [17] .",
