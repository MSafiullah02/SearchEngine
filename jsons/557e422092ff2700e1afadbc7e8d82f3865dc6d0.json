            "text": "The performance of tracheotomy is a common procedural request by critical care departments to the surgical services of general surgery, thoracic surgery and otolaryngology -head & neck surgery. A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology -Head & Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head & neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main body: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any nonemergent procedure. Conclusion: The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible. Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy. The safety of healthcare professionals who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating is paramount.",

Non-fenestrated, cuffed tracheotomy tube of appropriate size, with balloon inflated sufficiently to avoid cuff leak/avoid aerosolizing the virus. Careful attention to avoid damaging the endotracheal tube cuff during insertion. Initial advancement of the endotracheal tube could be performed to ensure the cuff is distal to the tracheotomy incision [17] (to prevent airflow through the surgical tracheotomy). If possible, pause ventilation during tracheal incision and ensure the cuff is still intact/inflated before reinitiating ventilation [17] . Stop ventilation before insertion of tracheotomy tube and confirm rapid and accurate tube placement with early inflation of the cuff (generous inflation of cuff to ensure seal against tracheal wall). Attach anesthetic circuit to the tracheostomy tube and manually ventilate gently with the aim of minimizing an airway leak. Ideally, confirm placement with end tidal CO2 measurement. [19] Confirm the absence of a cuff leak Secure the tube to avoid ANY chance of accidental decannulation. Connect the Heat and moisture exchanger (HME) directly to the tracheotomy tube [14, 17] to reduce aerosolization of the virus if the anaesthetic tubing is disconnected. Avoid disconnecting HME, but if necessary, disconnect distal to HME [17] . Avoid/minimize use of open suction in the airway prior to insertion of tracheotomy as this may be aerosol generating. If available, suction into a closed circuit system is recommend. We caution the use of bronchoscopy as detailed above. If required, utilize a video bronchoscope and appropriate connectors to minimize aerosol generation. Limit the presence of staff in the room to the bare minimum.",

The task force expects this information and recommendations will aid in the discussions with health care leadership as to the importance of this equipment to safely perform tracheotomies as outlined in these recommendations.

This is a time of uncertainty and we want to take every opportunity to aid in maximizing the safety of healthcare professionals performing tracheotomies using best available evidence and recommendations at this time. The information available continues to evolve and it is essential to remain up to date with newly available data, guidelines and other valuable online tools [12, 17, [19] [20] [21] .
