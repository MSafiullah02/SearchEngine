In this paper, we present WifiTrace, a network-centric approach for contact tracing that relies on passive WiFi sensing with no client-side involvement. Our approach exploits WiFi network logs gathered by enterprise networks for performance and security monitoring and utilizes it for reconstructing device trajectories for contact tracing. Our approach is specifically designed to enhance the efficacy of traditional methods, rather than to supplant it with a new technology. We design an efficient graph algorithm to scale our approach to large networks with tens of thousands of users. We have implemented a full prototype of our system and deployed it on two large university campuses. We validate our approach and demonstrate its efficacy using case studies and detailed experiments using real-world WiFi datasets.",

In contrast to client-side approaches that depend on the use of Bluetooth and mobile apps a network-centric approach does not require data collection to be performed on the device or apps to be downloaded by the user on the phone. Instead, users use their phone or mobile device normally and the approach uses the network's view of the user to infer their location and proximity to others. Our approach is based on WiFi sensing [24, 43] and leverages data such as system logs (\"syslogs\") that are already generated by the enterprise WiFi networks for contact tracing. Although our approach does not require the use of WiFi location [30] , such techniques, where available, can further enhance the efficacy of our approach. Our network-centric approach to contact tracing offers a different set of trade-offs and privacy considerations than Bluetooth-based client-centric methods; one of the goals of our work is to carefully analyze these tradeoffs.",

Consider a student who visits the university health clinic and is diagnosed with an infectious disease. The university health clinic officials decide to perform contact tracing and seek the consent of the student for network-based contact tracing. Since the user could have transmitted the disease to others over the past several days it is important to determine what campus buildings and specific locations within each building were visited by the student during that period and which other users were in the proximity of the student during those periods. The health officials input the WiFi MAC address of the student's phone into the network-centric contact tracing tool. The tool analyses WiFi logs generated by the network, and specifically association and dissociation log messages for this device, at various access points on campus to reconstruct the location(building, room numbers) visited by the user. It further analyzes all other users who were associated with those access points at those times to determine users who were in proximity of the user and for how long. This location and proximity reports are used by health officials to assist with contact tracing. Additional reports for each impacted user can be recursively generated.",

The manual process is challenging to scale up to larger numbers of users, especially for larger outbreaks of disease. Phone-based Contact Tracing: Since smartphones are now ubiquitous, the use of phone-based sensing for contact tracing has emerged as a key technology to automate and scale the contact tracing process [2, 9] . The most common method involves the use of Bluetooth to transmit a unique (and often anonymized) identifier from each phone. A phone also listens for such identifiers from other phones in its proximity. Thus, the device can determine which other users/phones are in its proximity at each time instant. When a particular user contracts an infection, their device id is used by others to determine if they have been in the proximity of the infected user.",

Many standalone contact tracing apps have also implemented this approach, which also involves having each phone upload its collected data to a server for contact tracing analysis [1, 3, 4, 6, 9] . We note that such a client-centric approach requires a user to first download a mobile app before contact tracing data can be gathered-users who have not downloaded the app (or have opted in) are not visible to other phones that are actively listening for other devices in their proximity. Thus the overall effectiveness of the approach depends on the level of user adoption. This is seen as a key hurdle from the experience of Singapore's TraceTogether app [6] , which has seen only 1.1million downloads despite needing a critical mass of 4million active users (around two-thirds of the population) to be effective [5] .",

In contrast, network-centric WiFi sensing involves using the network's view of one or more devices to perform analytics. The approach has been used for monitoring the mobility of WiFi devices by analyzing the sequence of the access points that see the same device over a period of time [24] .

The key premise of the approach is that the mobility of a user's phone is visible to the network through the sequence of WiFi access point associations performed by the device as the user moves, which allows the network to determine the locations visited by the users' device and other co-located devices that were present at those locations by virtue of being associated with those APs. Thus, the approach relies on passive WiFi sensing by passively observing devices as they move through the network. There are some key advantages of such an approach over a client-centric approach, Unlike a client-based approach that needs a critical mass of users to opt-in or download an app before proximity can be effectively determined, the wireless network can \"see\" all devices that are connected (associated) to it at all times. Hence, a network-centric method is easier to deploy and scale to large numbers of users without any initial deployment hurdles.",

This is because this method relies on syslog of network events, SNMP reports, or RTLS events that are routinely logged by many enterprise networks for purposes of performance and security monitoring.

Coarse-grain proximity sensing can increase false positives, and hence the approach uses the duration of proximate co-location as an indicator of risk of infection and the duration of proximate co-location can be determined accurately (same as Bluetooth). Moreover, since we designed our approach to enhance traditional contact tracing, rather than replace it, coarse-grain proximity information, along with co-location duration, is still useful to health professionals for identifying users who should be subjected to traditional contact tracking checks. 1 WiFi-based contact tracing only works in areas with WiFi coverage -which are largely indoor spaces and a few key outdoor spaces. This method does not work outdoors where no WiFi coverage is available. In contrast, Bluetooth methods work \"everywhere\"-both indoors and outdoors-since they involve listening to other devices and do not depend on a network.

To manage such a large network, enterprise WiFi networks uses controller nodes that have the capability to administer and manage the APs and the network traffic, along with detailed logging and reporting capabilities. As a user moves from one location to another, their mobile device (typically a phone) associates with a nearby access point. Since the locations of APs (building, floor, room) is known, the sequence of AP associations over the course of a day reveals the trajectory of the user and the visited locations. To reconstruct this trajectory we assume that the WiFi network logs contain association and disassociation events as seen by each AP. Typically this information is of the form: timestamp, AP MAC address, Device MAC, optional user-id, event-type, where event-type can be one of association, disassociation, reassociation, authorization, and unauthorization. Typically when a device switches to a new AP due to user mobility, this is visible to the network in the form of disassociation with the previous AP and an association with a new AP.",

There are two approaches to handling this problem. First, we recommend that operational control of the tool be in the hands of the organization's IT security group. Recall that the approach is based on WiFi network monitoring data that is already routinely gathered by IT departments for network performance and security monitoring. For example, our campus uses such data to track down compromised devices that are connected to our WiFi network and may be responsible for DDOS attacks from inside. Another example is tracking down student hackers, since the hacking of university computers (e.g., to change course grades) is a common exploit on university campuses. Audit and compliance laws in many regions also necessitate gathering network logs for subsequent analysis and audits. To address these issues, IT departments routinely collect detailed network logs and use them for optimizing performance or handling security incidents.",

For instance, larger outbreaks of disease may require allowing direct access to health officials who are performing contact tracing. In this case, we can address privacy concerns by not storing user identities or real MAC addresses with the tool itself. Instead, user names and device MAC addresses are anonymized by a cryptographic hash (eg SHA-2 hash). All queries on the tool are done using hashed identities and not the real ones. The actual mapping of user names and device MAC addresses to their hashed values is stored separately from the tool, and this information is accessible only to a small trusted group. To perform contact tracing on an individual, this trusted person needs to authorize it (e.g., once user consent is obtained) by releasing the mapping of the actual name of the user and their device MAC to the hashed values. The tool can then be queried using the hashed values of that user's information. Similarly, once proximity reports are generated, they can be sent to the trusted person, who can then deanonymize that information using the mapping table. In this manner, it is not possible to query the tool to track activities of an arbitrary user, unless first authorized, which prevents misuse. Our current campus deployment uses this anonymized data approach for additional safety.",

Figure 5 (a) shows the confusion matrix, with a precision of 0.93, recall of 0.94, and a high F1-score of 0.93. As can be seen, the inferred location matches the ground truth location with high accuracy. The errors mainly occur when a user is walking (in all cases, these involved short session of tens of seconds to 3 minutes). When a user is in transit between locations, their mobile device makes AP transition by disassociating from previous AP and associating with a more proximate AP. The threshold for switching APs and aggressiveness of these switches varies across mobile phone makes, models and manufacturer. This results in some mobile phones that stay connected with an earlier AP even through there is a nearby AP with better connectivity; this can result in a location error where the ground truth location is a bit further away from that shown by the more distant AP. In almost all cases, it the user stays at the new location for more than a few minutes (2 to 3 minutes in our observations), their phone switches to the closer AP which has a stronger signal. Hence, for very short sessions during walks, the true location may be off from the inferred location by up to one AP \"cell. \" Figure 6 depicts the accuracy of the inferred location for varying session lengths observed across four of the devices (namely, iPhone, Samsung, Motorola and LG phones) used in our user study. As can be seen, once the session length exceeds around 3 minutes, the accuracy rises to 100%. For contact tracing, we are typically interested in locations that visited by a user for a few tens of minutes; as shown in the figure, the approach provides high accuracy for such cases. Figure 5 (b) shows a scatter plot of session duration as reported by our tool and the ground truth. As can be seen, there is good match between the actual and ground-truth of session durations; the small errors occur at location entry or exit due to the lag in the mobile device switching to the nearest AP.",

This is the same data that would be used by health professionals for their contact tracing, except that we use a fully anonymized version of this data for our experiments. Table 3 depicts the characteristics of the WiFi logs. The US university has an Aruba network of 5500 APs deployed across 230 buildings. It has 38000 users comprising 30000 students and 8000 facultystaff (figures are rounded to the nearest thousand). The dataset spans Jan 2020 to May 2020, which includes the COVID-19 lockdown that began during Spring break (mid-March). The Singapore university has a mixed Aruba and Cisco network comprising 13,000 APs deployed across 240 buildings. It has 50,000 users comprising 40,000 students and 10,000 faculty/staff. The dataset spans Feb 2020 to May 2020 and also includes the COVID19 quarantine which was progressively announced by the government, ending with a full lockdown like the US University. We randomly choose a user from our dataset and assume they are infected with one of the above diseases and use our tool to compute the number of locations visited by the user over that period and the number of co-located users. We perform contact tracing assuming \u03c4 = \u03c9 = 10 mins and \u03c4 = \u03c9 = 30 mins, which implies location visited for at least 10 (or 30) minutes and co-location of at least 10 (or 30) minutes. For each disease, we repeat each contact tracing experiment for 50 randomly selected students, and then 50 randomly chosen faculty or staff users. Figure 8 depicts our results. As can be seen, the number of locations visited by an infected user grows as the duration of contact tracing grows from 2 days for Flu to 10 days for Measles. We find that the number of location visits is insensitive to \u03c4 beyond \u03c4 > 10 mins (as discussed in more detail in the next section). A student visits \u2248 37 locations per day while a faculty/staff user is somewhat less mobile and visits \u2248 15 locations per day. Figure 9 depicts the proximity results from our contact tracing experiment. As shown, \u03c4 = 10 min yields a large number of colocated user, 500 colocated users for Flu over a 2 day period, rising to over 800 users for MEasles over a 10 day period for a student. For \u03c4 = 30 min, the number of colocated users is lower-but still high -300 for flu and 400 for Measles. The colocation count is lower for facultystaff users (Figure 10 (b) ) but is still quite high (200 to 500) for \u03c4 = 10 and substantially lower (between 100 and 200) for \u03c4 = 30 mins.",

While users visited 20-80 locations per day for \u03c4 = 10 mins during the normal period, after March 25 th , the number of AP locations visits drops sharply for all users due to lockdown policies. This will significantly alter contact tracing results fro our tool for users who become ill during such lockdown.

Searching the co-locators using linear search requires complete scan of the entire dataset sequentially, resulting a high overhead across all runs irrespective of the number of observed co-locators of device. Additionally, as the number of nodes increase, the search overhead also increases. In contrast, our graph algorithm efficiently identifies relevant edges and nodes relevant to the specified query, thereby reducing the search space overhead Also, adding the constraint of \u03c4 results in further pruning of edges resulting in reduced search space reducing the time and space complexity of our algorithm. This behavior is depicted in Figure 12 that compares the execution overhead of the two approaches for our campus dataset.

A key consequence of this result is that device count seen by an AP does not equal user count. While all WiFi logs log device association information not all of them provide user ownership information. If such information is missing, RADIUS authentication logs should be additionally used to map devices to owners to avoid double counting devices as separate users. Figure 13 shows the number of unique devices seen by APs in different types of campus buildings and the corresponding user count (eg ARUBA syslogs provide both types of information). As shown locations like dorms and classrooms see between 1.5X to 2X difference in unique devices and unique users (since users may connect a phone and a laptop to the network), Only dining areas (cafeteria) see low over counting since users are likely to carry only their phone when eating. This result highlights the importance of considering device ownership to avoid over counting users by only considering connected devices.",

[12] has shown that authenticity attacks can be easily performed on Bluetooth based contact tracing apps. Such attacks can result in forging the location visited and creating a fake history of a user introducing risk to the society as shown in [12] . Bluetooth apps suffer from privacy issues as noted in [16, 38] . As a result, privacy issues for Bluetooth-based contact tracing has received significant attention [10, 11, 22] . Privacy-preserving methods include the use of homomorphic encryption for determining contacts [8] and the use of private messaging to notify possible contacts [40] , to name a few.",

While bluetooth-based contact tracing method using phones have become popular recently, these approaches suffer from the need for a critical mass of adoption in order to be effective. In this paper, we presented a network-centric approach for contact tracing that relies on passive WiFi sensing with no clientside involvement. Our approach exploits WiFi network logs gathered by enterprise networks for performance and security monitoring and utilizes it for reconstructing device trajectories for contact tracing. Our approach is specifically designed to enhance the efficacy of traditional methods, rather than to supplant it with a new technology. We presented an efficient graph algorithm to scale our approach to large networks with tens of thousands of users. We implemented a full prototype of our system and deployed it on two large university campuses. We validate our approach and demonstrate its efficacy using case studies and detailed experiments using real-world WiFi datasets. Finally, we discussed the limitations and privacy concerns of our work and have made our source code available to other researchers under an open-source license.",
