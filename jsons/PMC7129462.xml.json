A large outbreak of MERS occurred in Korea from May to July 2015 [3], [4]. Although the country had advanced medical systems with reliable public health monitoring capabilities, the outbreak, which started with a single case, caused massive public fear, affecting various aspects of civil life. Inappropriate initial responses and insufficient information were believed to cause unnecessary social chaos [5], [6], [7]. Because of worries about infection, the majority of the public refrained from performing normal social and economic activities [8], [9], [10]. For example, owing to a sharp decrease in Chinese tourists, the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) reported that the number of tourists in June decreased by 41% compared with the previous year [11]. As a result, the country had to experience lower economic growth than originally estimated before the outbreak, even though the Korean government declared a de facto end to the MERS outbreak on July 28, 2015, approximately 10 weeks after the first confirmed case [12].",

In Korea, in addition to Twitter and Facebook (two widely used social networks world wide), short-text comments on news articles are extremely popular and often provide a common medium for expressing personal emotions and thoughts about social phenomena. The machine learning challenges in sentiment analysis using Twitter and Facebook data (such as short text lengths and semantic heterogeneity) would remain the same for mining the short-text comments we collected.",

We developed a machine-learning engine for sentiment analysis of a large population. Our approach utilized information-theoretic and machine-learning techniques (such as topic modeling and word embedding) and included an effective method for extracting emotions from texts that hold sentiments (such as emoticons and so-called Internet slang). For comparative analysis, we additionally collected and analyzed articles and comments data for the H1N1 influenza epidemic in Korea in 2009 and the Ebola hemorrhagic fever reports in Korea in 2014.",

It was first isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and has since spread to the Middle East, Africa, Europe, the United States, and Asia including Korea [1], [16]. As of January 10, 2017, World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1,879 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 659 deaths associated with MERS-CoV [17]. 27 countries have been affected by an outbreak of MERS-CoV, but the majority of cases (>85%) have been reported from Saudi Arabia [17]. Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are known to be the natural source of infection in human, and consumption of contaminated milk, urine, or meat as well as direct contact with infected camels is the suspected transmission route [16]. In addition, human-to-human transmission through close contact of an infected individual with family members and health care workers was also confirmed [18], [19]. For example, Chen X. et al. [20] reported that 94.1% of MERS-CoV cases in the 2015 outbreaks in Korea had a history of contact in hospital facilities, and six cases (3.2%) were infected with MERS-CoV through community contacts.",

Various attempts have been made to develop vaccines against MERS-CoV, and they are based on inactivated or attenuated viruses, viral vectors, virus-like particles, DNAs, or recombinant viral proteins [26]. In particular, subunit vaccines containing Receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral S protein has been shown to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice, representing a great potential for effective MERS-CoV vaccine development [27], [28]. In addition, RBD is an attractive therapeutic target of anti-MERS-CoV drugs [26]. The RBD binds to CD26 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) expressed on epithelial cells and initiates infection of the host cells [29]. Furthermore, viral proteases such as PLpro and 3CLpro, and viral accessory proteins are also potential targets for antiviral agents [30], [31], [32].",

After removing stop words, we deleted the words that occurred less than 20 times. Finally, we obtained a total of 18,589 unique words. Then, we used the EM algorithm to determine the Dirichlet and conditional multinomial parameters for a 3-topic LDA model. The top words from some of the resulting multinomial distributions are illustrated in Fig. 6(b). In the LDA, these distributions are expected to capture underlying topics in the corpus. We grouped the words in the corpus according to these resulting distributions of individual word, and then we named each group based on the words in the group (disease, government/politics, and economy). In step B4, we computed the daily fraction of each topic to draw Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 10(a).",

We then computed the TE values from these time series to generate the results shown in Fig. 4. This was to quantify the information transfers between the variables.

Due to the high death rate, mass media reacted excessively (Fig. 9b), which then triggered an unnecessarily high level of fear among the public (as indicated by the edge with 0.53 TE in Fig. 4b). Such a high level of reaction to news articles was likely to make the reporters write more and more MERS-related articles (as predicted by the edge with 0.52 TE in Fig. 4b). Accordingly, a positive feedback loop was created between the mass media and public emotion variables, thus creating an overreaction to MERS.

Second, our approach for extracting emotion from a text word was effective in increasing the number of emotion-bearing words in social media corpora, which typically consist of short texts, making it difficult to perform sentiment analysis. For instance, by the proposed emotion separation technique, we could increase the number of emotion-bearing words from 582,448 to 1,010,945 (out of a total of 25,934,307 words in the short-text comment data), yielding a 73.6% increase.",

To provide a plausible explanation of the public overreaction to MERS observed in Korea, we focused on the interplay between the disease, mass media, and the public emotions, discovering an intriguing loop of information transfers between the media and the public. Moreover, using our methodology, we reported various in-depth analysis results that would be helpful for alleviating the unnecessary fear and overreaction of the public regarding infectious diseases occurring in the future. In this regard, we anticipate that our approach will provide an efficient way of rapidly monitoring the reaction of the public to a nation-scale infectious disease, revealing useful information for timely control of the disease.",
