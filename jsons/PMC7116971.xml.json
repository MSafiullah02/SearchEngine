            "text": "People spend 85%\u201390% of their time indoors, motivating the need to control indoor pollutants, and prevent or reduce indoor health risks [1,2]. Natural ventilation is generally considered to be an effective solution for reducing indoor pollutants but must be carefully examined to determine its effectiveness. For example, natural ventilation may cause pollutant transmission between multistory households [3], which can be adversely affected if they are adjacent to households with high levels of indoor pollutants [4]. Moreover, the airborne transmission may contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, as demonstrated during the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [[5], [6], [7]]. The SARS virus was detected in rooms where the occupants did not carry the virus, suggesting that natural ventilation was responsible for the cross-transmission [8]. Clearly, additional efforts should be dedicated to investigate the mechanisms of pollutant cross-transmission through natural ventilation. In that regard, single-sided natural ventilation through windows that are flush with a building facade significantly increases the potential for pollutant transmission between multistory households and motivates our study [9].",

These forces considerably impact the pollutant transmission between households in multistory buildings [9,10]. Pollutant transmission with either buoyancy- or wind-driven airflow has been extensively studied. The methods primarily included full-scale experiments, small-scale experiments, multi-zone simulations, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Lim et al. [11,12] used full-scale experiments and multi-zone simulations to investigate pollutant cross-transmission in a hospital. Pollutants expelled by patients on the lower floors re-entered upper floors via buoyancy-driven airflow; hence, inhibiting cross-transmission was proposed as a preventative measure. Mu et al. [13,14] utilized wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations to evaluate the impacts of the wind direction and source location on pollutant cross-transmission via wind-driven ventilation in a multistory building. The results indicated that the cross-infection risks in leeward conditions were not always lower than those in windward conditions. Other similar studies based on experiments and simulations have examined airflow paths and the corresponding pollutant cross-transmission, as impacted by balconies [[15], [16], [17]], mechanical exhaust systems [18], and the characterization of a global Reynolds number for indoor and outdoor airflow [19].",

            "text": "Pollutant cross-transmission driven by a single force is not realistic because buoyancy and wind typically act together to transport pollutants between households in buildings. Wu et al. [20] applied full-scale experiments to compare the contributions of buoyancy and wind forces during pollutant transmission between households on the same floor in a residential building. The experiments revealed that the wind force was dominant and produced more noticeable effects on the cross-transmission. The spread of pollutants from the released location to other spaces was shown to be enhanced by the ambient wind. Mao et al. [21] utilized multi-zone simulations to study the spread of pollutants via a combination of buoyancy and wind on the same and different floors. The indoor-outdoor temperature difference, ambient wind, building tightness, and source location collectively affected the pollutant cross-transmission in high-rise buildings. The pollutant concentration was reduced by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude on the floors above the pollutant source. Gao et al. [22] used CFD simulations to assess if wind exacerbated or suppressed the upward pollutant transmission. The results indicated that low-speed winds induced pollutants to enter upper floors, whereas high-speed winds formed an air curtain near the building facade and restricted pollutant transmission between floors. Furthermore, Mu et al. [23] used CFD to simulate the effects of solar radiation on the facade of a high-rise building and determined the impact of the facade's direction (sun-side or shade-side) on the re-entry of pollutants into the upper floors.",

It has been shown that some openings serve as a barrier (e.g., a partially opened tilt window) and effectively restrict pollutant transmission between floors, even under active ventilation conditions [4]. Gao and Lee [24] applied full-scale experiments to identify the ventilation performance of three window types and found that the performances varied based on the window types and locations. Heiselberg et al. [25] and Grabe et al. [26,27] used small-scale experiments to further study the characteristics of jets and stratified airflows through typical windows and compared the ventilation rates and airflow resistances. Wang et al. [28] utilized CFD simulations to characterize wind-driven ventilation through three window types and developed semi-empirical models to predict ventilation rates. Furthermore, Wang et al. [29,30] numerically investigated single-sided ventilation using six window types, based on buoyancy alone and a combination of buoyancy and wind. The building thermal conditions and window ventilation depended on the window type, even when the window opening areas were identical. Recently, Larsen et al. [31] developed a new formula for predicting the airflow rate for single-sided natural ventilation, which was more accurate than the existing equations. However, the new model underestimated airflow rates compared to the CFD predictions.",

Fig. 2\nillustrates the window types: each window is 1.23 m (w) \u00d7 1.48 m (h). The open area A and gap \u03b4 of each window type, which correspond to a typical window opening, are summarized in Table 1\n. The open gaps were not identical to ensure the same open area for each window.",

The combined force that drives the airflow through the building was induced by the indoor-outdoor temperature difference and ambient wind. When the outdoor temperature was below 23 \u00b0C, the mean thermal sensation could be controlled within \u00b10.5 \u00b0C [35]. Therefore, to ensure meaningful results, an outdoor temperature of 20 \u00b0C was specified. In accordance with guidelines from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, if the outdoor temperature is 20 \u00b0C, the maximum acceptable indoor temperature is 27.5 \u00b0C [35]. Hence, an indoor temperature of 28 \u00b0C was specified, and the 8 \u00b0C temperature difference between the interior and exterior of the building was consistent with our previous study [4].",

The RANS equations govern the transport of averaged flow quantities, with an appropriate turbulence model for representing a range of turbulence scales. Compared with large eddy simulation and detached eddy simulation models, the RANS-based modeling approach significantly reduces the required computational power and resources [34,37]. Several studies have successfully employed RANS models to predict indoor and outdoor airflows in windward and leeward conditions [23,39]. The baseline k-\u03c9 turbulence model, which is a two-equation eddy-viscosity model, was also found to yield satisfactory accuracy and stability when modeling an indoor airflow [40]. Moreover, studies have indicated that the baseline k-\u03c9 model performs better for solving flow over a back-step, which is a similar configuration to flow around a building, as compared with other two-equation eddy-viscosity models [38]. The use of the RANS and baseline k-\u03c9 models to predict the turbulent airflow will be validated in the study.",

The discretization error for the medium-to-fine mesh was 4.25% using the grid convergence index [43], demonstrating that the solutions were not grid-dependent. The final mesh used the medium resolution for the building interior and the coarse mesh for the building exterior, for a total of 740\u2013760 million cells for the different window cases. The computations ran on dual-node 2.6-GHz Intel Xeon processors with 64 GB of RAM.

The internal turbulent airflow was driven by a temperature difference created by cold (left surface) and hot (right surface) walls, corresponding to a Rayleigh number of 1.43 \u00d7 106. The air velocity and temperature profiles in the cavity were measured by laser Doppler anemometry and K-type thermocouples [44], and Fig. 3(b)\u2013(g) compare the profiles with our CFD simulations at each vertical location. Between the cavity walls, the velocity profiles demonstrated that the air descends near the cold wall and rises near the hot wall, corresponding to the changes in temperature and thus density. In general, the CFD predictions for the air velocity and temperature were in excellent agreement with the experimental data.",

The temperature difference between the test chamber and the environmental chamber was kept as 5 \u00b0C, whereby the indoor (chamber) environment was warmer. Due to the temperature difference, air in the test chamber moved through the open window and exhausted via two small openings in the ceiling of the environmental chamber. The fiber shield was used to prevent the warm air from the test chamber mixing with the supply air. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was chosen as the tracer gas, which was uniformly distributed in the test chamber. Perino and Heiselberg [45] also performed a CFD analysis employing the RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model, and compared the prediction for airflow rate in terms of air change rate per hour (ACH) with their experiment. As shown in Fig. 4(b)\u2013(c), the ACH and CO2 concentration decreased as time progressed. Perino and Heiselberg [45] reported that their CFD simulation under-predicted the experiment for ACH; however, our CFD predictions are in better agreement with their experiments. Furthermore, our CFD predictions for CO2 concentrations were in good agreement with the experiments [45]. Therefore, the results provided further evidence that the CFD models were credible to solve the tracer gas transmission via buoyancy-driven airflow.",

Fig. 6\nshows the airflow pattern for the VSW case at a wind speed of 5 m/s in the windward condition. As shown in Fig. 6, the airflow can be divided into a downward circulation region (A), a stagnation region (B), an upward separation region (C), and a recirculation region (D) consisting of a large vortex [49,50]. The flow separation and vortex development demonstrate the complex nature of the flow around a building. As the dominant driving forces change, the airflow patterns become more complex. Moreover, with windows located in different regions relative to the airflow, the ventilation can vary significantly from one configuration to the next. Hence, the transmission of pollutants can fluctuate significantly between different floors.",

            "text": "The air change rate per hour is used to quantify the ventilation rate, which is defined as the ratio of the volume flow rate through a room to the volume of the room in a 1-h period. The volume flow rate was calculated by integrating the velocity perpendicular to the window opening based on the steady airflow field provided by the RANS-based model [18,51,52]. The air velocity near the opening should be carefully examined to eliminate false contributions by short-circuiting flows or turbulence-induced ventilation. Notably, the method for determining the ACH used herein is reasonably valid for steady airflow conditions. The impacts of time-dependent dynamics caused by the fluctuating ambient wind on heat and mass transfer were not considered. In addition, it has been reported by Mu et al. [23] that the ACH calculations were slightly higher than the tracer gas decay method, while the results approximated those predicted by empirical models [23]. Nevertheless, the calculation of ACH based on the steady flow field from the RANS-based model was still widely used, in view of the desirable computing efficiency and detailed information that can be provided [18,23,52]. Fig. 7\npresents the relationship of the ACH and wind speed for windward (left column) and leeward (right column) conditions for each floor. In the windward conditions, the wind could either assist or oppose the buoyancy force to ventilate the building, depending on the wind speed. The buoyancy force was dominant when the wind speed was low, whereas the wind force became dominant as the wind speed increased. When the dominant force switched from buoyancy to wind, the ACH first decreased and then increased with increasing wind speed. After that, the wind dominated the building ventilation, and the ACH generally increased with increasing wind speed in the windward conditions (and was more substantial than that in the leeward conditions). ACH was the largest for the first floor, moderate on the second floor, and increased slightly on the third floor. This was due to the airflow patterns in front of the building, and the higher ACH on the third floor was also caused by the flow separation above the building.",

The HPW, VPW, and TILT types create openings that effectively direct ambient wind into a building. In contrast, the other three window types impede the wind from entering the building, whereby the window panes block the airflow path. In leeward conditions, changes in the ACH with wind speed and building floor were less prominent than in the windward conditions. By comparing the ventilation rates for each window, the TILT type was found to provide better ventilation performance across all flow conditions, whereas the other window types were similar to each other (Fig. 7(b), (d), and (f)). Overall, greater ventilation was achieved as more air entered the buildings. Notably, the ventilation performance of the HPW type varied significantly with the floor level.",

The average concentrations fluctuated with increasing wind speeds because the buoyancy and wind forces counteracted one another. The wind suppressed the airflow, and the buoyancy induced the airflow; once the forces matched intensity, minimal air was allowed through the windows, and the pollutants remained indoors. The pollutant concentration fluctuation was more evident on the first floor. Further discussion on the counteracting phenomenon of the buoyancy force and wind force was provided in our previous work [30].",

The location of the pollutant source in a multistory building is another critical factor affecting cross-transmission. When the source was situated in the first floor room, the pollutant transmission to the upper floors was more significant for each window configuration in leeward conditions. When the source was in the second floor room, more pollutant was transported to the lower floor in windward conditions. In contrast, the pollutant transmission to the upper floor became more substantial in leeward conditions for all window types except the AW. When the source was located in the third floor room, the pollutant concentration on the first floor was minimal, as the first floor was far from the source. Overall, the VSW and AW types were the most effective in reducing pollutant transmission. The airflow driven by the buoyancy force transported the pollutant to the upper floors, whereas the wind-driven airflow created a bidirectional transmission because of the different flow patterns forming near the facade. Consequently, the pollutant transmission to the upper and lower floors caused by the coupled effects of buoyancy and wind depended on the location of the source.",

The selected wind speeds are related to Ar; hence, three cases are shown: Ar = 2.5 (buoyancy-dominant), Ar = 1.0 (buoyancy and wind), and Ar = 0.1 (wind-dominant). When the infector released the virus on the first floor, the infection risk in the leeward conditions was higher when the buoyancy force was dominant, as shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b). With increasing wind speeds, the infection risk in the windward conditions was higher with comparable buoyancy and wind, as shown in Fig. 13(c) and (d). With higher wind speeds, there were no obvious differences in the infection risks for the windward and leeward conditions. Moreover, the infection risk was significantly reduced once the wind became dominant, as shown in Fig. 13(e) and (f). If the infector released the virus on the second floor, the infection risks on the first floor in the windward conditions and on the third floor in the leeward conditions were higher, as shown in Fig. 13(a)\u2013(d). Once the wind exceeded the buoyancy, the infection risks on the first and third floors in the leeward conditions were higher, as shown in Fig. 13(e) and (f). When the infector released the virus on the third floor, the variances in infection risks versus wind directions were opposite to those in the first floor scenario, as shown in Fig. 13(a)\u2013(d). If the wind speed was large enough, the infection risk became higher in the leeward conditions, as shown in Fig. 13(e) and (f). Furthermore, the infection risk when the virus was released on the second or third floor was reduced by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude compared to the infection risk on the virus-released floor. Therefore, an infector releasing a virus on the central floor of a building may pose a more severe threat, owing to the cross-transmission by upper and lower airflows between floors. Furthermore, the performances of the various windows in controlling the infection risks were inconsistent. Overall, the VSW type led to the highest infection risk when the virus was released on lower floors, whereas the AW type led to the highest infection risk when the virus was released on the upper floors. Moreover, the infection risks with the various window types on floors further from the virus release location were reduced when the ambient wind was sufficiently strong. Therefore, it was essential to combine the driving force and source location to evaluate the performances of the various windows in reducing the infection risk.",

In the windward conditions, the HPW, VPW, and TILT window types provided better ventilation. In the leeward conditions, the TILT type showed better ventilation behavior, whereas the other window types were similar to each other. When the pollutant source was situated on the first floor, the average concentration caused by cross-transmission fluctuated with increasing wind speeds in the windward conditions. The AW and TILT types showed the best and worst abilities in restricting the pollutants from entering the upper floors, respectively. In the leeward conditions, the average concentration decreased when the wind speed increased. During low wind speed conditions, the AW and VSW types had the best and worst performance in preventing pollutant cross-transmission, respectively. The HPW and TURN types performed better with increasing wind speed, and the TILT and VPW types were worse.",

The re-entry of air may increase the risk of infection during an outbreak of a pandemic virus. The infection risks varied depending on whether the cross-transmission was dominated by buoyancy or wind. Moreover, the virus release location had a significant influence on the infection risk. Overall, the infection risk on the floor closest to the virus location was the highest. The performances of the various windows in controlling the infection risk were not consistent. When the flow conditions were changed, the abilities of the various windows to restrict the virus infection varied. Therefore, the driving force and source location should be considered together when evaluating the performances of various window types in reducing infection risk.",
