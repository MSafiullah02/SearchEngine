HL7-message routers are commercial off-the-shelf products supplied by many vendors (there is an open-source HL7-message router called Jengine available at http://www.jengine.org/ and an HL7 listener, which can receive messages from a hospital HL7-message router, at openrods.sourceforge.net).

The data include patient chief complaints, dictations, results of laboratory tests, and results of radiological examinations. The information systems send these data to the HL7-message router in real time, and the HL7-message router can forward these data to biosurveillance organizations without delay. If a computer in a biosurveillance organization is temporarily incapable of receiving the data, the HL7-message router will queue the data for up to a week until the computer becomes available. Second, an HL7-message router can support bidirectional, real-time communication between computers in a healthcare system and computers in a biosurveillance organization by using the query message type.4\nFor these reasons, HL7 messaging is a core element of emerging biosurveillance IT standards, as we discuss in Chapter 32. It is worthwhile to point out that HL7 defines a communications protocol at the application layer and does not address the transport layer (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, RS-232). Therefore, it is possible for two systems to speak HL7 at the application layer but still not be able to physically communicate.",

This process may introduce a several-day delay between the time the patient is seen and the diagnoses are available in a billing system.

Fortunately, the vast majority of clinical laboratories in the United States are highly automated, using computers to perform tests, store results, and communicate results. Test results are generally available electronically very soon after the tests are performed. Results are available not only directly from the laboratory information system but may also be transmitted to an HL7-message router and to an enterprise data warehouse or a POC system (described below). There are many examples of hospitals that send laboratory data electronically to health departments, although these hospitals represent but a tiny fraction of the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the United States (Effler et al., 1999; Overhage et al., 2001; Hoffman et al., 2003).",

He promulgated the use of standards for the naming of laboratory tests and the reporting of their results (discussed in detail in Chapter 32). Until these standards are more universally used in health care, however, the construction of biosurveillance systems that collect laboratory data from hospitals will be time-consuming and expensive (the monitoring of laboratory test results and orders from national laboratory companies is far more feasible at present, as we discuss in Chapter 8).",

HL7-message routers represent unique resources for the present. POC systems enable collection of symptom and sign data in coded format. Their decision support capabilities can support real-time bidirectional interactions among front-line clinicians and biosurveillance organizations. They can support computer-based case detection and case reporting. The RHIO component of the NHII movement is also important, if it is supported, to the future of biosurveillance.
