Beam detection and resonance usually are obtained using piezo-electrics or optical levers. In static mode, the detection is monitored resulting in a force image, while in dynamic mode the resonance behaviour monitoring allows for a force gradient image. Rudnitsky et al. used MFM to sense the location of magnetic particles that were tethered to a substrate [117] , while others have used MFM to examine the magnetic domain structure of thin films under imposed strain and examine electron spin configurations resulting in a claimed sensitivity of two electron spins [118, 119] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 522, "end": 527, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 731, "end": 736, "text": "[118,", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 737, "end": 741, "text": "119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Magnetometry"}, {"text": "A relatively new application of tipped micro-cantilevers is in the field of data storage. The tip is scanned over a polymeric film and at desired locations it is heated (usually by subjecting it to a bias voltage), pressed in to the polymer film, and removed leaving a small pit impression in the film. In the \"write\" mode the cantilever makes numerous such pits at certain locations to define the zeros and ones, which define a data set [120] . In \"read\" mode, the pits are scanned over, basically using the cantilever as an AFM [121] . Finally, in \"erase\" mode, the pits are produced very close to each other, and this results in leaving behind a polymer film surface that is only mildly disturbed from the initial state, a surface undisturbed enough so that it can be \"rewritten\" upon [122] .

The advent of inexpensive, mass-produced micro-cantilever sensors, promises to bring about a revolution in detection of terrorist threats. Extremely sensitive and highly selective sensors can be developed for the detection of chemical, biological and radiation threats using micro-cantilever platform. Micro-cantilever resonance such as resonance frequency, deflection, and Q-factor undergo variation due to extremely small changes in external stimuli. Cantilever geometry determines sensitivity while selectivity is governed by analyte-substrate interaction mechanism.
