RVFV first identified in Rift valley in Kenya in 1930 as a member of the Bunyaviridae family, which is transmitted to the human through infected mosquito vectors as well as through aerosolization, but the initial transmission of the virus to human is thought to be via mucous membrane revelation or inhalation of viral particles during the management of infected animals (Anyangu et al., 2010, Daubney et al., 1931, Hartman, 2017, Ikegami and Makino, 2011).",

The L segment encodes a single protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), while the M segment codes for the precursor for two glycoproteins (Gc and Gn), as well as two major non-structural proteins, the 78-kDa NSm1 and the 14-kDa NSm2. The S segment encodes a structural protein, the nucleocapsid protein (N), as well as a nonstructural protein (NSs) (Ikegami et al., 2005, Won et al., 2006, Won et al., 2007). Both L and N proteins are indispensable for viral RNA replication and transcription, while Gc and Gn protein make up the protein component of the viral envelope as a glycoprotein. The nonstructural proteins, NSs play a key role in the pathogenesis of the diseases and have been recognized as a virulence factor because of its ability to inhibit the host's immune response by thwarting the antiviral interferon (IFN) response (Billecocq et al., 2004, Bouloy et al., 2001, Ikegami, 2009).",

So, the most conserved target that stimulates both cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies against RVFV is indispensable for an effective vaccine development. Epitopes are mostly recognized as the antigenic determinants that represent the immunogenic portion of the protein antigen and provoke precise immune responses (Shi et al., 2015, Vivona et al., 2008). Several research findings revealed that epitope-based peptide vaccine could efficiently elicit defensive immune responses against miscellaneous pathogens, such as malaria (Oyarz\u00fan and Kobe, 2016), influenza virus (Stanekov\u00e1 and Vare\u010dkov\u00e1, 2010), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (Firbas et al., 2006, He et al., 2015, Sominskaya et al., 2010), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) (Jin et al., 2009). However, In spite of the availability of the genome sequence in the GenBank database for emerging infectious pathogen, like RVFV, the immunity accompanying with protection is now largely unknown to the researchers. So, the development of a vaccine against this infectious pathogen is more difficult and challenging work. Therefore, immunoinformatics study could be an effective approach for the screening of dominant immunogens from the available genome sequence data for effective vaccine design against emerging infectious and neglected tropical disease (Terry et al., 2015).",

The SMM-align predicts peptides and their core sequences binding to 5 Human HLA-DP, 6 HLA-DQ, and 15 HLA-DR alleles. For the identification of CD4 + T-cell epitopes and corresponding HLA class-II alleles with good affinity, the threshold value for IC50 (minimum inhibitory concentration of a biological substance) was taken as < 250 nM in the SMM-align method.",

Immunogenicity is mainly associated with vaccine development and it is considered as the center of the vaccine adeptness (Leroux-Roels et al., 2011). So, the immunogenicity of the predicted CD8 + T-cell epitopes was observed by the MHC I immunogenicity tool of IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/) (Calis et al., 2013). Conserved epitope identification is an essential criterion in epitope-based vaccine design due to the broader protection against several strains of the selected species. Due to the greater importance of epitope conservancy, the CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes were subjected to the IEDB conservation across antigen tool (http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) for epitope conservancy prediction (Bui et al., 2007). The allergenicity was anticipated through the AllerHunter web-server (http://tiger.dbs.nus.edu.sg/AllerHunter/). AllerHunter is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and pairwise sequence similarity based cross-reactive allergen prediction program (Muh et al., 2009).",

However, the predicted crystal structure was in a complex form with protein and an epitope. So, the Discovery Studio (version 16.1.0.15350) was used to simplify the complex structure. After the separation, the protein molecule and the peptide (epitope) were then converted to PDBQT format through the AutoDock tools. For the identification of binding energy at the binding groove of HLA-C*12:03 with an epitope, the space box center was set at 7.890, 30.823, and 76.726 \u00c5 in the X, Y and Z axis, respectively. The size was set at 88, 46 and 64 \u00c5 in the X, Y and Z dimensions, respectively, and these analyses were done in 0.314 \u00c5 spacing parameter. These parameters were set for all the selected CD8 + T-cell epitopes. Finally, the docking simulation was performed by using the AutoDock Vina. Another docking study was performed as a control for the critical evaluation and scientific acceptance of our docking study. The docking method and parameters were set just like as previously mentioned parameters so that we can easily compare between sample and control. In the control section, the docking simulation was completed between human natural killer cell receptor (epitope-GAVDPLLAL) and HLA-C*12:03 protein molecule.

Next step analyses were continued with the CD8 + T-cell epitopes that exhibited interaction with \u2265 5 MHC-I alleles, had the positive immunogenicity score, \u2265 0.5 combined scores, and \u2265 0.5 antigenicity score. So, the analyses revealed that among 146 CD8 + T-cell epitopes only 40 epitopes (3 N and 37 G protein) fulfilled the above-mentioned criteria. The epitopes, their position, combined score, antigenicity, and immunogenicity score are presented in Table 2\n. Herein, we found G protein epitope 882FTNWGSVSL890 as the highest antigenic with a 2.0756 VaxiJen score, whereas the epitope 134IAMTVLPAL142 was considered as the lowest antigenic for its lowest, 0.5100 score among all the 40 N and G protein CD8 + T-cell epitopes. On the other hand, we got the G protein epitopes, 625TAFIRWVYK633 and 948LRAPNLISY956 as the highest (0.46351) and the lowest (0.00046) immunogenic, respectively for their immunogenicity score in IEDB tool (Table 2). In this study, we identified 34 MHC class I binding alleles (15 HLA-A, 9 HLA-B, and 10 HLA-C alleles) for 37 CD8 + T-cell epitopes of G protein, whereas 9 alleles (1 HLA-A, 3 HLA-B, and 5 HLA-C alleles) were found for the 3 epitopes of N protein. Among them, the N protein epitope 144MMHPSFAGM152 interacting with 7 HLA alleles possessing the maximum number of alleles, while the G protein epitope 882FTNWGSVSL890 interacting with maximum 10 HLA alleles which is followed by 2 epitopes (625TAFIRWVYK633, 1158KTILLICLY1166) with 9 alleles, 2 epitopes (134IAMTVLPAL142, 1142FFDWFSGLM1150) with 8 alleles, and 3 epitopes (144VFALAPVVF152, 1167VALSIGLFF1175, 1169LSIGLFFLL1177) with 7 HLA alleles. Interestingly, the HLA-C*12:03 was identified as the most conserved MHC class I binding allele for both 3 N and 37 G protein epitopes (Table 2).",

Over the past thirty-five years, about thirty viral pathogens have emerged due to their human affecting nature. Most of these pathogens are zoonotic and their origins are ominously correlated with ecological, environmental, and socioeconomic factors (Dye, 2014, Nii-Trebi, 2017).Top priority emerging infectious diseases such as Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg haemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah, and Lassa fever are caused by the viral pathogens which are highly pathogenic to the human (Nii-Trebi, 2017). The immunity associated with protection from these pathogens remains largely unknown to the researchers. So, the vaccine development against these newly emerging infectious diseases is demanding and challenging work (Terry et al., 2015). Therefore, the genome sequence screening of viral pathogens could be the potential step for the identification of vaccine target against the newly emerging infectious diseases.",

Therefore, T-cell epitope-based vaccination could be a distinctive process of eliciting a robust immune response against the infectious pathogens, such as viruses (He et al., 2015, Jin et al., 2009, Stanekov\u00e1 and Vare\u010dkov\u00e1, 2010). According to the Xu et al. (2013) N protein of RVFV is an effective human T-cell immunogen which is able to stimulate comprehensive and potentially protective immunodominant CD8 + T-cell responses. On the other hand, Dodd et al. (2013) demonstrated that, CD4 + T-cells are essential for strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that mediate RVFV clearance from peripheral tissues. The researchers also revealed that CD4 + T-cells are responsible for the regulation of immune responses to RVFV infection as well as play a vital role in averting the onset of neurologic disease (Dodd et al., 2013). On the contrary, the researchers Bird and McElroy (2016) reviewed that the contribution and function of CD8 + T-cells and CD4 + T-cells are considerably less known in endorsing and maintaining proper immune control of RVFV infection. However, we screened and identified the promiscuous CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells epitopes (Tables 2 and S3) using in silico approaches for further research in developing epitope-based peptide vaccine in the near future.",

However, the small peptide vaccine could be rejected due to the MHC restriction, lack of helper activity, and also weak presentation of antigen by antigen presenting cell (APC), but this rejection may be overcome by using compound peptide vaccines, which include both CD8 + T-cell and CD4 + T-cell epitopes or longer peptides with CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes (Lohia and Baranwal, 2014, Naylor et al., 2011). The overlapping CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes have been identified as the vaccine candidates against the cancer Metadherin protein (Dhiman et al., 2016) and H1N1 influenza virus protein (Lohia and Baranwal, 2014, Lohia and Baranwal, 2015). Herein, we identified overlapping CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes for peptide vaccine design (Table 4). It is noteworthy that the CD8 + T-cell epitopes, 597IICLAILYK605, 596AIICLAILY604, and 625TAFIRWVYK633 were found as the core sequence of the CD4 + T-cell epitopes, but they contained the conservancy score of 10.00%, 35.00%, and 95.00%, respectively. So, these epitopes could not be the vaccine target. Since, both humoral (Th2) and cellular (Th1) mediated immune response produced protective immunity for RVF VLP (Virus like particle) vaccinated animals (Mandell et al., 2010), predicted CD4 + T-cells epitopes were analyzed for Th1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3 and Th2 cytokine, IL-4 production using in silico tools. The experimental study showed that splenocytes from VLP-vaccinated mice secreted IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 which is stimulated by the RVFV-specific antigen, consistent with both humoral and cellular immune responses (Chung et al., 2008, Kortekaas et al., 2012, Mandell et al., 2010). An in silico approach has been used for the identification of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 induced promiscuous epitopes from Leishmania donovani antigen (Kashyap et al., 2017). Therefore, only those CD4 + T-cell epitopes of G and N protein were selected which were found to be IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 inducers in in silico analysis (Table 4). The results revealed that although the CD4 + T-cell epitopes, 619NPLMWITAFIRWVYK633, 597IICLAILYKVLKCLK611, and 596AIICLAILYKVLKCL610 are IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 inducers, they could not be the potential vaccine candidates due to the low conservancy score of 95.00%, 5.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. In addition, the primary and secondary humoral immunity inducer B-cell epitopes were also predicted and the results demonstrated that two of the G protein B-cell epitopes, \u201cGVCEVGVQAL\u201d and \u201cRVFNCIDWVH\u201d overlapped with the CD8 + T-cell epitopes, \u201cVCEVGVQAL\u201d and \u201cRVFNCIDWV\u201d and all the B-cell epitopes were non-allergenic to the human. The researcher Lal and his coworkers reported that superimposition or overlapping of CD8 + T-cell epitopes with B-cell epitopes would confirm good T-cell response with precise T-cell memory and will be advantageous for the design of the epitope-based vaccine (Lal et al., 2006). So, these epitopes have the potentiality in making an effective vaccine or diagnostic kit.",

            "text": "The severe RVFV outbreak have been recorded in human with high fatality rates for the year 2000 to 2016 in different countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Africa, Namibia, Mauritania, Egypt, Senegal, Niger and Uganda (Balkhy and Memish, 2003, Hartman, 2017, Hassan et al., 2011, M\u00e9tras et al., 2012, Monaco et al., 2013, Nguku et al., 2010, Sow et al., 2014, Sow et al., 2016). According to the Mansfield et al. (2015) an incursion may occur in Europe due to the geographical range and emergence of RVFV in the northern Egypt and Middle East. So, the higher population coverage in these regions or country is essential to make an effective vaccine against RVFV. In this study, the combined coverage showed that Saudi Arabia, Brazil (Mixed), Uganda, Kenya, and Senegal covered about 98.98%, 98.12%, 90.32%, 89.85%, and 89.00% population, respectively (Table S5). The population coverage for Europe was identified as 99.01% in combined coverage, while the coverage was 98.01% for the World. South Africa covered only 0.4%, but in South African (other) the coverage was found at 91.28% (Table S5). Finally, the results revealed that the epitopes of RVFV G protein would be the effective vaccine target for epitope-based peptide vaccine design. Moreover, molecular docking simulation was performed to explore the binding interaction of the predicted CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes of the G and N protein. 3D structures of the HLA-C*12:03 and HLA-DRB1*01:01 were available in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession id 1EFX and 2FSE, respectively. The docking simulation was performed for those CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes which were overlapped or superimposed with each other. Herein, the CD8 + T-cell epitopes \u201cAVFALAPVV\u201d, \u201cLAVFALAPV\u201d, \u201cFALAPVVFA\u201d, and \u201cVFALAPVVF\u201d overlapped with both CD4 + T-cell epitopes \u201cLPALAVFALAPVVFA\u201d and \u201cPALAVFALAPVVFAE\u201d, while the rest of the other CD8 + T-cell epitopes, \u201cMMHPSFAGM\u201d, \u201cIAMTVLPAL\u201d, \u201cFFDWFSGLM\u201d, and \u201cFLLIYLGRT\u201d overlapped with \u201cHMMHPSFAGMVDPSL\u201d, \u201cGIAMTVLPALAVFAL\u201d, \u201cGSWNFFDWFSGLMSW\u201d, and \u201cFFLLIYLGRTGLSKM\u201d, respectively and bound with their respective HLA-alleles with significant binding affinity and variable number of hydrogen bonds (Table 7 and Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). So, these epitopes could be the possible vaccine candidates for epitope-based RVFV vaccine design.",

Furthermore, selected CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes have high binding affinity to their respective HLA-alleles and the allele frequency of these epitopes are high in endemic as well as in many non-endemic regions.
