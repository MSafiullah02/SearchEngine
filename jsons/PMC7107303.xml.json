This study was approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. A definite diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was made if the patient met at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) culture positive for C. neoformans from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), (2) positive result of CSF India ink smear of centrifuged sediment for Cryptococcus, and (3) compatible histopathological findings (5\u201310-\u03bcm encapsulated yeasts observed in brain tissue). Probable cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in patients who presented with the clinical syndrome of meningitis and positive cryptococcal antigen titer in CSF, albeit without microbiological or pathological documentation. A positive result of testing of undiluted CSF with use of the latex-cryptococcus antigen detection system (Immuno-Mycologics) was considered to be diagnostic. The API 20C AUX system (bioM\u00e9rieux Shanghai) was used for identification of isolates. CD4+ T lymphocyte count <300 cells/mm3 with no immunocompromising conditions was considered to be idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia. Predisposed hosts were defined as patients with immunocompromising diseases (cirrhosis, chronic kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus, solid malignancies, hematologic malignancies, splenectomy, and solid organ transplantation), corticosteroid, other immunosuppressive medications, or idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia. Patients without identifiable risk factors were considered to be immunocompetent.",

Data from America, France, and Thailand series all showed a relatively low proportion of previously healthy hosts (range, 17%\u201332%),with the majority of patients having some underlying conditions [1,22\u201328]. However, a high percentage of previously healthy hosts among HIV-uninfected patients with cryptococcal meningitis have been reported from other regions [29\u201332]. Our recent epidemiological study revealed that up to 54.4% of patients without AIDS with cryptococcal meningitis were without predisposing factors [33]. Although the role of ethnic factors in the susceptibility of this disease is still unclear; the previously healthy patients with cryptococcosis in our country renders an opportunity for us to study the genetic susceptible factors in this disease. Our results showed that the homozygous variant genotype O/O was associated with the risk of cryptococcal meningitis, and the proportion of deficient MBL-producing genotypes in patients with cryptococcal meningitis was significantly higher than that in the control group, indicating that MBL deficiency may be one of the predisposing factors of cryptococcal meningitis that has not been reported. Admittedly, this predisposition was present in only 7.8% of HIV-uninfected patient with cryptococcosis. The difference was also present in the subgroup of patients (11.5%) without immunocompromising factors. Therefore, the genetic defect in MBL may provide one of the answers to the mystery why apparently immunocompetent patients develop cryptococcal meningitis. Eisen et al [10] found no statistically significant difference between the proportion of MBL genotypes LAX/O and O/O (associated with deficient plasma MBL levels) and other MBL2 genotypes in noncompromised patients with cryptococcosis and normal control subjects (7 of 35 vs 38 of 236). In addition, the authors did not find an increased proportion of patient with cryptococcosis with plasma MBL levels <500 ng/mL (11 of 36 vs 69 of 236). Apart from the relatively small sample size, the difference in ethnic population (Australian versus Chinese) and Cryptococcus strains may explain the inconsistent results of the 2 studies, because patients with cryptococcal meningitis were infected with both Cryptococcus gattii and C. neoformans in Australia and predominantly C. neoformans in China [34, 35]. A validation study is needed to further examine the results of the current study.",

MBL can modify the efficiency of uptake and the expression of other phagocytic receptors. Researches over the past decade have indicated that MBL provides a distinct third pathway of complement activation by which MBL plays a role of host defense [36]. Pathogenic strains of the fungus C. neoformans are known to be resistant to MBL binding because of the protection by polysaccharide capsule, and soluble MBL binds acapsular C. neoformans only [37\u201339]. Panepinto et al [40] also demonstrated that MBL can bind only to C. neoformans mutant defective in cell integrity, but not to the encapsulated wild-type strain in vitro observations. Acapsular mutants of C. neoformans appear to have a surface MBL-binding mannoprotein that is not present on the encapsulared cell surface. However, it was suggested that solid phase MBL increased binding of encapsulated C. neoformans to monocytes, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived macrophages, although the biological significance of solid-phase MBL and its mechanism of improving C. neoformans binding to phagocytes remained unclear [38].",
