Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SAFV is closely related to the theilovirus species, which consists of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), Theiler's rat virus, and Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus.4 Since then, SAFV has been isolated from nasal and stool specimens of children with respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms in many countries.3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 To date, 11 genotypes of SAFV have been identified on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene2 with SAFV\u20102 and SAFV\u20103 having high seroprevalence.6, 11\n",

            "text": "Saffold virus is a non\u2010enveloped single\u2010stranded RNA virus, with an icosahedral capsid of approximately 30 nm in diameter.7 The RNA genome is approximately 8050 nucleotides consisting of a single polyprotein coding region flanked by 2 UTRs at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, with a variable length of poly (A) tail located at the terminus of the 3\u2019 Untranslated region (UTR). The polyprotein region is divided into the leader (L) protein, the precursor P1, which encodes capsid proteins (VP1 to VP4), and precursors P2 and P3 regions, which encode 7 nonstructural proteins (2A\u20102C and 3A\u20103D)3 (Figure 1A). Similar to known picornaviruses, SAFV has a 5\u2019 UTR of about 1040 nucleotides, containing internal ribosome entry sites that enable the initiation of translation through binding of canonical initiation factors and internal ribosome entry site\u2013specific trans\u2010acting factors.19, 20 The L protein located at the N\u2010terminal portion of the polyprotein is thought to be highly important in the pathogenesis of the virus. The TMEV, a virus that is structurally and functionally similar to SAFV,21 has been extensively studied because of its unusual phenotype.2 TMEV is divided into 2 subgroups on the basis of their neurovirulence22; highly virulent strains (GDVII and FA) that cause acute fatal encephalomyelitis, and low virulent strains (DA and BeAn), which cause milder encephalomyelitis with chronic progression to a demyelinating syndrome similar to multiple sclerosis (MS).2, 23 The L protein of TMEV has been shown to play an essential role in the differences seen between the 2 TMEV subgroups.24 The typical characteristics of the L region of TMEV, and indeed other similar cardioviruses, contain a well\u2010conserved zinc\u2010finger motif, an acidic region and a serine/threonine\u2010rich domain.25 Interestingly, the serine/threonine\u2010rich domain of L protein is partially deleted in SAFV.7 On analysis, the homology of L between SAFV and TMEV DA strains is 78%.16 In certain strains of TMEV (such as the DA strain), an alternative translation initiation site downstream from authentic initiation site is able to synthesize a small out\u2010of\u2010frame 18\u2010kDa protein referred to as L*.26 The SAFV lacks the AUG initiation codon required to translate L* protein, although it is unclear if the ACG present in that region of SAFV is used to produce a truncated L* protein.2\n",

The VP1 is the most exposed immunodominant protein and the most surface\u2010accessible capsid protein. The EF and CD loop structures are located in the VP2 and VP1 proteins, respectively, and are associated with host cell tropism and pathogenesis in cardioviruses.27, 28 The CD and EF loops are unique for each genotype of SAFV and are highly divergent among cardioviruses. Importantly, in addition to L protein, the CD loop of VP1 and the EF loop of VP2 have also been found to be important in virus persistence and host demyelination in TMEV.28, 29 We have previously suggested these are potential areas of study regarding SAFV.16\n",

Further, they constructed chimeric SAFV cDNA clones by replacing the VP1 and/or the VP2 gene of SAFV with those of TMEV of DA or GDVII strain. However, they were unable to rescue the recombinant viruses, even after 3 blind passages. Similarly, Shimizu et al31 generated chimeric SAFV and TMEV by replacing L protein of SAFV with that of TMEV DA strain and vice versa and studied their effects on interferons. Very recently, our laboratory generated an infectious cDNA clone of SAFV under the control of a human RNA polymerase 1 (hpol1) promoter (Figure 1B).16 In this method, the genomic viral cDNA is transcribed into an exact SAFV\u2010like RNA by hpol1 inside the cells. Compared to T7 polymerase\u2010driven reverse genetics systems, our approach has eliminated the need for troublesome in vitro RNA transcription from cDNA clones. It also eliminates the need to add extra bases during in vivo transcription at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of viral transcripts.32 Overall, studies using chimeric SAFV containing TMEV L have shown that the L protein is at least partially responsible for differences in suppression of interferons, cell tropism, pathogenicity of the virus, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking.16, 31, 33\n",

            "text": "The use of animal models provide an effective way of studying virus infections at a systemic level. However, finding an appropriate model for SAFV infection has proven to be a challenge.2 To our knowledge, the first published research article on using an animal model of SAFV was by Hertzler et al15 They found that ic inoculation of SAFV\u20102 to FVB/n (an inbred mouse strain commonly used for non\u2010clinical drug discovery) mice causes neuropathological changes consistent with acute encephalomyelitis. While the study above had started to uncover the pathogenesis of SAFV, hinting at invasive CNS infection, little progress was made thereafter. In 2016, however, 3 separate groups published work done on various mouse models, directly showing SAFV CNS infection.16, 61, 62 The first accepted paper was from our laboratory, which used SAFV\u20103 on BALB/c mice and AG129 mice (mice with an intact immune system, but lacking alpha/beta interferon (IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2) and IFN\u2010\u03b3 receptors63). We showed that BALB/c mice infected ip with SAFV\u20103 showed neither clinical symptoms nor detectable viral titre in the CNS. Previous studies on TMEV using inbred 129Sv mice lacking IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors developed severe encephalomyelitis (acute TMEV infection), whereas mice lacking IFN\u2010\u03b3 receptors were highly susceptible to persistent infection in the white matter of the brain, causing demyelination.64, 65 We hence reasoned that the use of AG129 mice, lacking both IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 receptors,63 would permit both acute and persistent infections if possible. We found that ip infection of SAFV and chimeric SAFV in 2\u2010week\u2010old AG129 mice initially caused ruffled fur, hunched posture, and subsequently progressed to hind\u2010limb paralysis and death.16 Interestingly although, 3\u2010 to 4\u2010week\u2010old mice did not die to paralysis nor death, and fully recovered showing no further symptoms.16 This was later supported by Sorgeloos et al62 when they demonstrated that infection of interferon receptor deficient (IFNAR\u2010KO) 129/sv mice permitted infection of the brain, spinal cord, heart, pancreas, and spleen. At the same time, Kotani et al61 showed that ic inoculation of SAFV causes non\u2010fatal infection of neonatal and 6\u2010week\u2010old ddY and BALB/c mice. They further showed demyelination in the spinal cord of infected neonatal ddY mice spine in one of their strains, but not in adult mice. It should be noted that while Kotani et al61 showed demyelination, they attributed it to a TMEV infection rather than an effect of SAFV. Both our laboratory16 and Sorgeloos et al62 have also shown that it is highly unlikely that SAFV causes demyelination, and similarly in humans, Galama et al66 suggested that an association between SAFV and MS is highly improbable.",

This is further highlighted by Ito et al52 who suggested an association between acute pancreatitis and SAFV in humans. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that several viruses from the Picornaviridae family, such as coxsackie\u2010B virus, have been associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (which involves the destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas).2, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 However, a longitudinal study of children carrying HLA genotype (associated with high risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus) found no significant association between SAFV and diabetes.72 Overall, more work is needed to understand the pathogenesis of SAFV in the pancreas, and further work on recently established models could provide a means of doing so.",

Importantly, the structural capsid proteins of TMEV, which has been shown to be important for receptor binding,76 are completely different from that of SAFV and could explain the reason for low infectivity rates of macrophages. This low infectivity of macrophages is a potential reason for the lack of persistence despite the presence of TMEV DA L,16 as persistent TMEV DA infection is thought to be a result of infected macrophages crossing the blood\u2010brain barrier.77 However, it should be noted that the activation or differentiation state of macrophages have been suggested to play an important role in TMEV infection78 and hence the possibility of macrophage infection in vivo, while highly unlikely, cannot be completely ruled out.",

The 3\u2010 to 4\u2010week\u2010old AG129 mice infected with SAFV only develop mild clinical symptoms between 7 and 10 dpi, but subsequently recover from the symptoms and show no further observable symptoms up to 35 dpi.16 They thus provide a model to study demyelination in SAFV viral persistence. Our laboratory,16 congruent with Kotani et al,61 failed to demonstrate persistent infection. This suggests that the pathological mechanism underlying the demyelination processes of SAFV and TMEV may be different.",

In vitro, SAFV has been shown to infect multiple cell types, including neurons, which result in apoptosis.14 Sorgeloos et al62 further showed SAFV's preference for astrocytes over neurons in mixed mouse primary neuron\u2010astrocytes cultures. In vivo, Kotani et al61 showed infection of glial cells, but not neurons, in both early adult (6\u2010week\u2010old) and neonatal brains of ddY and BALB/c mice. Sorgeloos et al62 however showed infection of both neuronal and glial cells. The possibility of acute infection of neurons could explain the ability of SAFV to cause sudden death in infected patients.18, 79 Two laboratory test results have demonstrated death and/or severe neurological symptoms in young interferon\u2010deficient mice infected with SAFV (within neurons).16, 62 However, the absence of neuronal infection in neonatal and 6\u2010week\u2010old ddY and BALB/c mice conferred survival from SAFV infection.61 One however needs to be cautious in interpreting the results in this fashion, as CNS is not the only location of SAFV infection, and coinfections with other viruses is not uncommon in human studies of SAFV (reviewed above). Overall, while results on neuropathogenesis seems varied between groups highlights CNS infection by SAFV differs depending on strain, age of infection, and breed of infected animal (and hence genetic makeup).",

The availability of an infectious cDNA clone of SAFV16, 30 could provide a powerful tool for this, allowing us to conduct reverse genetics studies and to understand the differences between SAFV and related viruses.
