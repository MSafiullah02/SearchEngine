RSV is an enveloped, single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Pneumovirus of the Paramyxoviridae family. Based on its reactions with monoclonal antibodies and on the genetic characteristics of the attachment protein (the protein G), RSV can be divided into the subgroups A and B [Mufson et al., 1985]. Although RSV\u2010A and \u2010B can co\u2010circulate in children in a community, the prevalence of each subgroup may shift yearly and can vary among different communities [Coggins et al., 1998; Scott et al., 2004; Arbiza et al., 2005; Sato et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2006; Zlateva et al., 2007; Shobugawa et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010].",

The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Clinical specimens were collected from patients with acute respiratory infection when they first sought medical care (prior to their being admitted to a specific unit of the hospital) at the Fever Clinic of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, a large comprehensive hospital for medical treatment, teaching, and scientific research in Beijing. According to the regulations for management of acute respiratory infection in China, all patients with acute fever must be screened at a Fever Clinic before being received by a specific medical department in a hospital. A total white\u2010blood cell count less than 10 \u00d7 109/L may suggest the presence of viral infections [Ruuskanen et al., 2011]. Thus, to exclude typical bacterial infections and include potential viral infections, patients \u226515 years old were included in this study if they presented with: (1) acute fever (body temperature \u226538\u00b0C); (2) white\u2010blood cell count \u226410 \u00d7 109/L; and (3) respiratory symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. On average, about 22 patients met these criteria each day during the study period. Every day during the study period, physicians blindly collected specimens from 5 to 10 patients meeting the enrollment criteria, without considering age, sex, ethnicity, and other symptoms. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from each patient, and both swabs were pooled in one tube containing virus transport medium (VTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy). Sampling was performed every day from May 2005 to April 2010, except in July and November 2005. The samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to being analyzed.",

Primers targeting the highly conserved fusion protein gene were used for RSV typing as described previously [Coiras et al., 2003]. RSV\u2010A and \u2010B were distinguished by the size of PCR products: 363 bp for RSV\u2010A and 611 bp for RSV\u2010B. Specific amplification of the fusion protein genes was confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR products.

This is the first study that characterizes the incidence of RSV subgroups in Chinese adults with fever and respiratory illness. The results of this study indicate that RSV\u2010A accounts for more cases of RSV infection (55.8%) than RSV\u2010B (44.2%) in the study population. The ratio of RSV\u2010A in this study is lower than that reported in Chinese children, in whom RSV\u2010A accounts for 73.7% of the RSV infections in Beijing [Deng et al., 2006] and for 79.5% of the RSV infections in Chongqing [Zhang et al., 2010]. Two factors may account for this disparity: (1) the subjects recruited in this study were adult outpatients, whereas those in other studies were mainly hospitalized children [Deng et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010]; and (2) samples were collected during different time periods. Zhang et al. [2010] collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from April 2006 to March 2009, whereas Deng et al.

Similar rhythms have been observed in children from Beijing, China [Deng et al., 2006] and Chile [Avenda\u00f1o et al., 2003]. The dominance of RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B has also been reported to alternate biennially in Japan [Sato et al., 2005]. A pattern in which RSV\u2010A predominated for 2 years and RSV\u2010B predominated for 1 year was reported in Chongqing, China [Zhang et al., 2010], Belgium [Zlateva et al., 2007], the United States [Coggins et al., 1998], and Kenya [Scott et al., 2004]. In Uruguay, two to four consecutive years of RSV\u2010A predominance were followed by 1 year of RSV\u2010B predominance [Arbiza et al., 2005]. Similarly, RSV\u2010B predominance for 1 year was followed by 4 years of RSV\u2010A predominance in Japan [Shobugawa et al., 2009].",

It has been shown that RSV\u2010A is more likely than RSV\u2010B to cause severe disease in hospitalized infants in two previous studies [McConnochie et al., 1990; Walsh et al., 1997]. In contrast, this study indicates that the clinical manifestations of RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B are very similar in Chinese adults with fever and respiratory illness. All of the RSV\u2010positive patients identified in this study had mild acute respiratory infections. The disparity may be attributed to the subjects recruited. Hospitalized infants, who had severe respiratory infection even requiring mechanical ventilation, were recruited in the two previous studies [McConnochie et al., 1990; Walsh et al., 1997], whereas only adult outpatients with fever and acute respiratory illness were investigated in this study.",

The use of multiplex PCR rather than singleplex PCR to detect RSV in adults may not be optimal, as viral titers are considerably lower in adults than in infants. Limitations in the study population should also be considered. Because the outpatients could not be traced, patients who deteriorated due to worsening RSV infections may have been missed in the study, possibly resulting in an underestimate of disease severity. Additionally, due to the small number of RSV\u2010positive patients in this study, a larger cohort of patients is needed to characterize the clinical manifestations of infections by each RSV subgroup. Although these points might be worth noting, they do not detract from the overall conclusions of this study.",
