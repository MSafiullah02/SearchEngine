The testis of the rhesus monkey responds rapidly to LH; increased concentrations of serum testosterone (T) are evident within 30 minutes, with maximum concentrations achieved by 1 hour (Toivola et al., 1978, Wickings and Nieschlag, 1980a, Wickings and Nieschlag, 1980b). Administration of human CG (hCG; a molecule with analogous functions to LH) for a 3-day duration results in a 10-fold increase in serum T concentrations in the adult rhesus macaque (Wickings et al., 1986). Treatment of adult cynomolgus (or long-tailed) macaques (Macaca fasicularis) with hCG for 16 days results in a 163% increase in the number of Leydig cells and a ninefold rise in plasma T concentration (Teerds, et al., 1989). Correspondingly, T is an important regulator of LH secretion, exerting negative feedback to reduce the frequency of LH and presumably GnRH pulses (reviewed by Tilbrook and Clarker, 2001). The T-mediated feedback in nonhuman primates occurs primarily through brain cell populations, although not through direct effects on GnRH neurons that appear to lack receptors for the sex steroids \u2013 androgens, estrogens, and progesterone (Saltzman et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The ovarian cycle in nonhuman primates, as in other species, is governed by a complex interplay among the gonads, the gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary, and the GnRH pulse generator in the medial basal hypothalamus (reviewed by Johnson and Everitt, 2000, Messinis, 2006, Zeleznik and Pohl, 2006). During the follicular phase, LH and FSH are released in low-amplitude, circhoral pulses, reflecting negative-feedback effects of estrogens on pulse amplitude but not frequency. At midcycle, estrogens trigger positive-feedback surges in GnRH, LH, and FSH, eliciting increases in pulse frequency and/or amplitude. Fully developed gonadotropin surges in women require the presence of small amounts of progesterone (P4); however, no such effect is seen in rhesus macaques (Zeleznik and Pohl, 2006). The luteal phase, following ovulation, is characterized by low-frequency, high-amplitude LH pulses, reflecting negative feedback primarily by P4. In addition to ovarian steroids, inhibins secreted by granulosa and luteal cells possibly exert negative feedback specifically on FSH release; however, the precise role of inhibins in nonhuman primate ovarian cycles is not yet clear (Zeleznik and Pohl, 2006, Randolph, 2008). Interestingly, FSH concentrations are elevated during the luteal phase in squirrel monkeys, suggesting that development of antral follicles may occur during this period, possibly permitting the extremely short (~5-day) follicular phase of these species (Yeoman et al., 2000).",

Negative feedback effects occur at both the level of the hypothalamus and the pituitary (Mizuno and Terasawa, 2005). A variety of experimental approaches have suggested that positive feedback by estrogens at the pituitary alone is sufficient to generate preovulatory LH surges, although GnRH plays an obligate permissive role. Nonetheless, other studies have indicated that hypothalamic release of GnRH increases in response to sustained elevations of estrogens. Negative feedback effects of P4 on GTH pulse frequency are assumed to occur at least partly within the central nervous system and are mediated at least in part by endogenous opioids. In addition, negative feedback effects of both estrogens and P4 at the level of the brain appear to be mediated in part by kisspeptin (Kp) (Plant et al., 2009).",

Gonadarche in male nonhuman primates is characterized by dramatic elevations in circulating concentrations of LH and to a lesser extent, FSH, reflecting primarily an increase in secretory pulse amplitude. These GTH increases, which are thought to reflect a concomitant amplification of pulsatile GnRH release from the hypothalamus, stimulate an increase in testicular volume (associated with growth of the seminiferous tubules, maturation of Sertoli cells, and proliferation of germ cells), development of Leydig cells, secretion of high levels of gonadal androgens, and initiation of spermatogenesis (Plant and Witchel, 2006). The primary androgen formed by the testis is T, which is responsible for the normal development of male structures, including secondary sexual characteristics such as facial and genital coloration (e.g. mandrill, Mandrillus sphinx) and specialized facial or body hair (e.g. baboon, Papio hamadryas hamadryas) as well as sexual behavior (Dixson, 1998). Testosterone may also be responsible for programming regions in the central nervous system (CNS) that regulate testicular function and male behavior. Normal differentiation requires the presence of T, but the prostate and external genitalia require DHT for appropriate development (Wilson et al., 1970).",

An early hypothesis \u2013 that the timing of puberty is governed by an endogenous \u201cpubertal clock\u201d in the CNS that initiates puberty at a specific age \u2013 is not widely accepted. Instead, the timing of puberty has long been thought to be governed by a putative \u201csomatometer\u201d that measures some index of somatic growth. The somatometer hypothesis is supported by compelling evidence. It has been noted that dietary restriction can result in a decline in both body weight and circulating gonadotropins when food intake is reduced in castrated males (Dubey et al., 1986). The observed decreases in FSH and LH were, however, restored by an infusion of GnRH. It has been suggested that insulin or amino acids could provide the link between nutritional status and reproductive function by influencing the synthesis of neurotransmitters critical for maintaining GnRH secretion (Steiner et al., 1983). Studies with M. fascicularis have shown that long-term administration of amino acids and glucose stimulates adult-like LH/FSH, presumably through the release of GnRH (Cameron et al., 1985a, Cameron et al., 1985b). It was concluded that blood-borne metabolic cues that specifically sustain glucose-induced elevation of insulin can stimulate the activity of GnRH-secreting cells and that these factors may be responsible for mediating maturational events within the brain (Cameron et al., 1985a, Cameron et al., 1985b).",

            "text": "Finally, a number of environmental factors are known to modulate the timing of puberty in humans and nonhuman primates. Social influences can advance or delay puberty, as described below. In seasonally breeding species, aspects of pubertal maturation may be gated by seasonal cues such as photoperiod. Rhesus males show seasonal increases in sexual behavior during the second and third year prior to the rise in plasma T. This species has shown a rise in both LH and T during the third year of life, with rapid decreases in the fall months, which coincides with the breeding season (Mann et al., 1989). In the seasonal Japanese macaque (M. fuscata), the process of maturation occurred over a 2-year period, with full maturity achieved at \u2265 6.5 years of age. It was concluded that based on testis size, plasma T, and seminiferous epithelium, gonadal activity developed rapidly during a short period of time and although spermatogenesis started during the mating season at 4 years of age, full sexual maturation was attained 2 years later. Similarly, in squirrel monkeys, the onset of ovulatory cyclicity in young females and the first T surge in young males are restricted to the breeding season, presumably in response to photoperiodic cues (Coe et al., 1981). Thus, seasonality \u201cimposes a quantum effect\u201d on pubertal timing such that gonadarche is more closely dependent on the number of breeding seasons elapsed since an individual\u2019s birth than on age per se (Plant and Witchel, 2006). Importantly, seasonally related cues do not necessarily govern maturation of the neural processes underlying pubertal reactivation of the GnRH neurons but instead may play a permissive role in the expression of gonadarche following this reactivation (Plant and Witchel, 2006).",

These primordial follicles develop into early antral follicles through the growth of the oocyte, formation of a zona pellucida, proliferation of granulosa cells followed by formation of the antral cavity, and development of the thecal cell layer. This early stage of development occurs in a continuous stream largely independent of gonadotropin stimulation.",

Estrogen production is a result of interaction between the granulosa and thecal cells, whereby thecal cells convert C21 steroids to C19 steroids under the influence of LH and granulosa cells subsequently aromatize these androgens to estrogens under the influence of FSH. Steroidogenesis is also affected by numerous paracrine factors, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF), activin, and inhibin (Zeleznik and Pohl, 2006). The majority of preovulatory follicles will undergo atresia, a process of degeneration and resorption. Only those follicles that are at the appropriate phase of development in late follicular phase can proceed to ovulate; the appropriate phase of development includes significant increases in FSH and LH receptor content and an increasingly dense capillary network that allows the follicle to continue to develop in the face of decreasing FSH in the late follicular phase. Eventually, sustained high concentrations of estrogens generate positive feedback that causes surges in GnRH, FSH, and most notably, LH. The LH surge stimulates final preovulatory maturation including completion of the first meiotic division in the oocyte, initiation of progesterone secretion by the thecal layer, and increased expression of collagenases, prostaglandins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) leading to the rupture of the follicle and its ejection into the oviduct.",

In humans and macaques, the CL has an intrinsic lifespan of 14\u201316 days in nonconceptive cycles. As opposed to most other mammals, the regression of the CL in nonhuman primates is not the result of endogenous prostaglandins but rather appears to be the result of luteal cells undergoing apoptosis associated with decreases in LH responsiveness (Brannian and Stouffer, 1991, Nakano, 1997).",

The possible adaptive significance of menstruation is controversial (Profet, 1993, Strassman, 1996, Finn, 1998), but there is general agreement as to the proximate causes. In the mid to late follicular phase, the endometrium, under the influence of estrogens from the ovary, undergoes edema; proliferation of stromal cells; angiogenesis; and increases in the size, number, and tortuosity of endometrial glands. During the luteal phase, progesterone, acting in concert with estrogen, causes further cell proliferation, edema, increased capillary permeability, and coiling of the spiral arterioles. At the end of the luteal phase, with declining concentrations of progesterone and estrogen, lysosomal membranes in the endometrium break down, releasing lytic enzymes; spiral arterioles constrict, causing ischemia; and vascular injury and plasminogen activators are released. As opposed to other mammals, in which the endometrium is then resorbed, in Old World monkeys the majority of the endometrial lining and blood from the ruptured arterioles are expelled through the vagina. There are some reports of menstruation occurring in New World monkeys, but the reports are not consistent.",

In species displaying such changes, estrogen generally stimulates swelling (tumescence) and reddening of the sexual skin. The swelling peaks during the periovulatory phase.

Monkeys exhibit a superficial implantation in which the trophoblast adheres to the uterine wall without complete endometrial penetration whereas in apes, the entire blastocyst penetrates the endometrial epithelium and invades the uterine vasculature (Luckett, 1974, Mossman, 1987, Lee and DeMayo, 2004).",

Saltzman et al. (2011) provide a more detailed discussion of the role of each of these hormones in nonhuman primate pregnancy. One feature of note that is unusual in nonhuman primates is the interaction of the mother, placenta, and fetus to generate placental estrogen synthesis (Albrecht and Pepe, 1999). In nonhuman primates, placental estrogen synthesis is dependent upon precursors supplied by the fetal adrenal gland. Nonhuman primate fetal adrenal glands are unique in the presence of a fetal adrenal zone that synthesizes dihydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), which is then used by the syncytiotrophoblast as a substrate for estradiol synthesis. This fetal adrenal zone involutes after birth, disappearing before adulthood (McNulty et al., 1981).",

The only nonhuman primate group in which lactation-induced anovulation is not routine is the New World marmosets and tamarins.

Walker and Herndon (2008) provides an excellent overview of what is known about reproductive senescence and menopause in nonhuman primates, with discussion of controversies stemming from differing uses of the term \u201cmenopause.\u201d Wise (2006) provides a thoughtful perspective, comparing what is known about reproductive aging in rodents with that in women. Recent findings on nonhuman primate reproductive senescence, along with commentary, are also found in Atsalis and Margulis (2008a). Female reproductive senescence differs among mammalian taxonomic groups. In nonhuman primates, the loss of the follicular pool is the primary event shaping the end of reproductive life, whereas in rodents, striking variation is seen in the size of the follicular pool remaining at the end of reproductive life as well as at maximum life span (Wise, 2006).",

These alterations stem from the declining negative feedback signals from the ovary (reduced circulating estrogens, P4, and inhibin), resulting in elevated GTH concentrations for a time, followed by declining GTHs. These hormonal changes are believed to affect disease risks (Wise, 2006). The risk associated with bone loss due to decreasing estrogenic activity on osteoblasts is well described; however, cardiovascular effects continue to be hotly debated.",

However, the stage of life at which this occurs is generally later than that observed in humans. Atsalis and Margulis (2008a), in reviewing the data on monkeys and apes, conclude that \u201cpotentially up to 25% of a female\u2019s life can be post-reproductive,\u201d This claim is made in reference to maximal life span; in comparison, a human female reaching the maximal life span (now around 120 years) will spend around 58% of her life in a post-reproductive state. When compared with average life span (as opposed to maximal life span), most nonhuman female primates will die at or before the point at which reproductive senescence begins. These comparisons have been controversial and will continue to be refined, given the oft-made claim that human female reproductive aging is unique and may be driven by indirect fitness advantages to post-reproductive women providing resources to grandchildren; i.e. the grandmother hypothesis (Hill and Hurtado, 1991, Peccei, 2001).",

An excellent overview of this process is provided by Sharpe (1994), and detailed discussions of recent theories about the molecular and cellular control of this process are provided by Sofikitis et al. (2008) and Cheng et al. (2010). Detailed investigations of primate spermatogenesis have been conducted in the rhesus macaque (Clermont and LeBlond, 1959, Arsenieva et al., 1961, Conaway and Sade, 1965, Fawcett et al., 1970, Barr, 1973, de Rooij et al., 1986), the cynomolgus macaque (Dang, 1970, Kluin et al., 1983, Fouquet and Dadoune, 1986), the stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides, Clermont and Antar, 1973), the African green (or vervet) monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops, Clermont, 1969), C. sabolus (Barr, 1973), the baboon (Barr, 1973, Chowdhury and Steinberger, 1976, Chowdhury and Marshall, 1980, Afzelius et al., 1982), and the common marmoset (Weinbauer et al. 2001). Clermont and LeBlond (1959) described 12 stages in the cycle of the rhesus seminiferous epithelium. Steps were defined by changes in the nucleus and acrosomal structures, and it was noted that each stage appeared in sequence with time over a particular area in a given seminiferous tubule. Depending on the species, tubule cycle durations range from 9.5 to 14.4 days, and the total duration of spermatogenesis ranges from 36 to 48 days (Table 8.2\n).",

Rodents and prosimian primates display a single-stage tubule structure while New World monkeys and hominoids (apes and humans) display a multi-stage tubular structure. Old World monkeys appear intermediate, with baboons and mandrills displaying a mix of single- and multi-stage tubules while macaques and vervets display predominantly single-stage tubules (Wistuba et al., 2003, Luetjens et al., 2005). Previous proposals that the multi-stage structure is associated with low spermatogenic efficiency have been disproved (Luetjens et al., 2005).",

Manipulation of FSH concentration in macaques will directly affect germ cell number and seminiferous tubule size (Wickings and Nieschlag, 1980a, Wickings and Nieschlag, 1980b, Moudgal, 1981; Madhaw Raj et al., 1982, Van Alphen et al., 1988).

In addition, aromatized T may mediate spermatogenesis via estrogen receptors present on spermatocytes, spermatids, and Leydig and Sertoli cells (Shaha, 2008). LH stimulation of the Leydig cells within the testis is responsible for maintaining high concentrations of T, the androgen essential for spermatogenesis. The mechanism by which LH controls androgen secretion has been studied (Arslan et al., 1986), and it was noted that chronic gonadotropin exposure (hCG) resulted in the activation of the stimulatory response required for T production. It was proposed that this activation occurred via enhancement of LH/CG receptor availability on Leydig cells (Wickings et al., 1986).",

Both macaques and marmosets display an acrosome maturation profile similar to that of humans, with increasing in vitro acrosomal response when moving from the caput to the caudal epididymis (Moore, 1981, Moore et al., 1984, Yeung et al., 1996). In addition to the ability to undergo capacitation and acrosome reactions, the epididymal sperm maturation process includes remodeling of sperm chromatin to a highly condensed form.

Testicular fluid has low concentrations of spermatozoa and is characterized by a low glucose and high inositol content (White, 1981). Collection of fluid from the cauda epididymis indicates that the composition is similar among species, although slight variations are noted. The chief characteristics of the cauda epididymal plasma are low concentrations of inorganic ions and high levels of organic constituents such as glycerylphosphylcholine, carnitine, sialic acid, hypotaurine, glycosidases, and phosphatases. The concentrations of sodium ions are ~20 mEq/liter. The potassium ion levels are generally greater than or equal to sodium levels, although in the rhesus, the potassium concentration is twice that of sodium. It is generally accepted that pH varies along the length of the epididymis but is usually within the 6.5\u20137.0 range, although it may occasionally be slightly higher (White, 1981).

Most nonhuman primates display dorso-ventral mounting postures, typical of most mammals; however, numerous variations are seen in relation to the nonhuman primates\u2019 varied locomotor styles (e.g. arboreal versus terrestrial). Nonhuman primates species vary in the number and duration of intromissions prior to ejaculation (Dixson, 1998), from single, brief intromissions (e.g. marmosets) to single but prolonged intromissions (e.g. stump-tailed macaque) to multiple, brief mounts (e.g. rhesus macaques), the most extreme case being the thick-tailed greater galago (Otolemur crassicaudatus), in which post-ejaculation intromissions lasting hours suggest the possibility of a genital lock. Capacitation is a phenomenon affecting the sperm that normally occurs within the female reproductive tract and, through enzymatic action, renders the sperm capable of fertilization (Dukelow and Yorozu, 1986). In most nonhuman primate species studied, this requires approximately 2 to 8 hours.",

Both squirrel monkey and macaque males display T-supported characteristics that arise during the breeding season. Male squirrel monkeys undergo weight gain (the \u201cfatted male\u201d response (DuMond, 1968, Lindburg, 1987)) of around 14%, caused largely by retention and deposition of water along the arms, shoulders, and back (Jack, 2007), as well as increases in testicular volume of 150% (Wiebe et al., 1984) and increases in aggressive behavior related to increasing circulating androgens (Wiebe et al., 1988). During the nonbreeding season, male rhesus macaques display reduced LH pulsatility (4 to 6 pulses per day (Plant, 1980, Wickings et al., 1986)), reduced diurnal rhythms in pulsatility (Wickings et al., 1986), regression of seminiferous tubules, and few spermatocytes or spermatids. In the months leading into the mating season, LH pulsatility increases, seminiferous tubular diameter increases threefold (Conaway and Sade, 1965), and spermatogenesis commences (Zamboni et al., 1974, Wickings et al., 1986). Breeding males also display skin reddening, likely related to increasing T production.",

This ratio of males to females appears to promote stability within the groups. Female offspring inherit the rank of their mother and, unlike male offspring, remain closely associated with their group and hierarchy throughout their life (Lutz and Novak, 2005; see Chapter 5). In the natural environment, males will move out of their natal group at maturity and attempt to incorporate into a new group; thus, the dominance status of the male is based more upon individual factors (age, temperament, size) than on relations. In colony-reared animals, males are usually deliberately culled from the group, ensuring an increase in stability and a decrease in potential for loss of genetic heterogeneity (Pusey and Packer, 1986, Beisner et al., 2010). Maintaining stability and decreasing aggression within groups is aided by a stable dominance hierarchy within each sex. Within large social groups there will be multiple matrilines, and the possibility of one matriline being overthrown is not uncommon. This situation happens when lower ranking matrilines group together and displace the highest ranking matriline. A retrospective analysis at The California National Primate Research Center revealed that matriline overthrows were more likely to occur if the alpha female had been removed from the group (Oates-O\u2019Brien et al., 2010). In addition, during the breeding season there appeared to be an increased risk of overthrows that was associated with increased levels of aggression between animals (Eaton et al.,1981).",

This analysis indicated that for this species, the presence of the sire and of other pregnant females in the group increased the probability of viable births while more frequent animal moves in and out of groups as well as lower parity decreased the probability of viable births. Sire presence was the single most important factor in most measures of reproductive outcome. Crockett et al. (1996) evaluated the value of computer simulations of population dynamics as a means to manage harvesting rates from a population of simian retrovirus-free cynomolgus macaques established on Tinjil Island, Indonesia. The simulation was used to determine that at intermediate birth and survival values that reflected the actual birth and survival rates, the island population of these animals would be approaching carrying capacity and that at high rates, the rate of harvesting from this animal population would need to be increased in order to not overpopulate the island, or provisioning would need to begin. This \u201cherd management\u201d approach can, then, be successfully employed with free-ranging breeding populations.",

Animals can also be introduced to each other in an environment in which there are barriers that allow sight and touch between individuals but prevent complete contact, or animals can be introduced to an environment without barriers. A study performed at Labs of Virginia (Westergaard et al., 1999) investigated the role different group formation practices had on rhesus aggression and reproductive performance. Results suggested that incremental addition of animals in small groups to the population in an enclosure with barriers that do not permit immediate contact decreased the incidence of aggression, trauma, and death.

An essential component of this is maintenance of superlative parentage and medical records. Molecular techniques such as DNA fingerprinting, analysis of DNA restriction length polymorphisms (RFLPs), short tandem repeats (STR), or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequently employed to confirm parentage and assess the degree of genetic diversity (von Segesser et al., 1995, Kanthaswamy and Smith, 1998, Kanthaswamy and Smith, 2002, Kanthaswamy et al., 2009, Kanthaswamy et al., 2010, Trask et al., 2011). Various management practices can be utilized to promote genetic diversity or minimize loss. These include fostering infants from one matriline onto dams in another matriline, removal of males after a designated number of breeding seasons, removal of complete matrilines, introduction of new males, or increasing the male:female ratio. Another possible method for increasing diversity is to select males for breeding who possess rare genetic alleles. However, because any procedure that alters the population dynamics within groups has the potential to result in aggression and trauma, the benefits of increasing genetic diversity must be balanced with the potential social impact.\n",

Pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemistrina) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fasicularis) are not known to show any seasonality and can conceive throughout the year (Ha et al., 2000a, Ha et al., 2000b). However, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) show distinct seasonality with regard to breeding. The breeding season for rhesus colonies in North America is most commonly between October and February (Eaton et al., 1981, Ehardt and Bernstein, 1986). Although rhesus macaques do not typically ovulate outside these months, they will continue to have menstrual cycles that may be more irregular than during the breeding months. As females age, they may cease to menstruate altogether during the nonbreeding months. See the section \u201cReproductive senescence\u201d above for more details on reproductive aging. Throughout the breeding season, the number of ovulations varies for each individual rhesus female and has been shown to be directly related to the female\u2019s body weight, social rank, and mean luteal progesterone level (Takahata, 1980, Garcia et al., 2009, Garcia et al., 2010, Du et al., 2010).",

The menstrual cycle of macaques is generally 26\u201330 days (Blakley et al., 1981, Walker et al., 1983). Outward indications of ovarian activity such as changes in sexual behavior, perianal swelling, and alterations in inguinal and facial sex skin coloration may aid in assessing the stage of the cycle depending on the species involved (Carpenter, 1942, Zinner et al., 2004, Engelhardt et al., 2005, Bradley and Mundy, 2008, Dubuc et al., 2009) Pubertal macaques also may have large variations in their intermenstrual cycles (Resko et al., 1982). Male macaques generally reach puberty at 3.5 years of age; however, they normally do not contribute significantly to breeding until 2 years later (Chambers K, 1982, Honjo et al., 1984). The age at which individual animals reach sexual maturity is governed by various factors, of which the animal\u2019s nutritional status and the social ranking of its dam are thought to be most important.",

Most pregnancies result in the delivery of one fetus; the incidence of twinning is very uncommon (Bercovitch et al., 2002, Sugiyama et al., 2011). Normally, infants are delivered at night and the female consumes the placenta. Labor is reported to last 5\u20137 hours, and prior to delivery, the female may show signs such as increased grooming, restlessness, and alteration in eating and sleeping patterns (Goodlin and Sackett, 1983). In addition, there may be a decrease in the female\u2019s body temperature prior to parturition (Ruppenthal and Goodlin, 1982). Complications such as dystocia have been reported in many macaque species and have been associated with the age and parity of the dam along with the percentage of the dam\u2019s previous pregnancies that resulted in caesarean section deliveries (Stockinger et al., 2011). Unfortunately, cases of dystocia may be difficult to detect, as most animals give birth at night when staff are not usually present to observe the births. Indications of dystocia include infants with facial bruising or edema, presence of protruding limbs at the vaginal orifice, and weakness or collapse of the dam. In instances where there are clinical indications that the delivery has been unsuccessful, medical intervention must be taken immediately in order to save the life of the dam and fetus. Treatments may vary from manual extraction of the fetus and placenta if it is lodged in the vaginal canal to delivery of the fetus by caesarean section. Should ultrasound examination indicate that the fetus is no longer viable, it may be prudent to initiate fluid therapy and supportive care to stabilize the dam prior to performing surgery.",

Retrospective analysis of reproductive performance in a captive colony of Japanese macaques suggested that the most important factor involved in abandonment was parity of the dam followed by her social rank. In this study, neonates were 90 times more likely to be abandoned by a primaparous than by a multiparous mother. Also, abandonment was six times more likely to occur by a low-ranking female than by a high-ranking female (Schino and Troisi, 2005). A correlation between the age of the dam and the incidence of an infant dying before 30 days of age has also been demonstrated. The incidence of death was found to be higher for offspring born to either primaparous or aged females (Gagliardi et al., 2007, Schino and Troisi, 2005). Studies have also examined the relationship between the body condition of a primaparous female at time of first conception and the time required to recover from pregnancy and lactation and also the effect on the postnatal development of the infant. Results from work carried out at the Caribbean Primate Center imply that the body condition of the female at first conception directly correlates with the growth and development of her infant and also with the time needed to recover reproductive capabilities postpartum (Mas-Rivera and Bercovitch, 2008). Females with higher body mass index (BMI) prior to conception had a more rapid recovery after parturition.",

During the initial weeks in the nursery, infants should be kept in an environment with an ambient temperature of 30\u201335\u00b0C. At the New England Primate Research Center, infants are offered 5% dextrose per os on the day of birth and then offered commercially available lactose-free infant formula with iron. The volume of formula is increased weekly from 15 ml per feeding to 35 ml per feeding over the first 4 weeks of life. Each infant is fed 6 times daily between 7am and 9pm. Then, at 4 weeks formula-soaked chow (Purina Monkey Chow, 25% protein, Purina Mills, Inc.) mixed with a small amount of banana is introduced. Over the next months, the amount of chow (both soaked and hard) is increased and the infant is gradually weaned off bottle feeding. To encourage the development of normal behavioral patterns, it is important that nursery-reared infants be introduced to age-matched peers as soon as feasible. Should circumstances dictate that an infant is reared in isolation for an extended period of time, studies have shown that reversal of abnormal behavioral traits that may have developed is best accomplished by introducing the nursery-reared infant to a younger infant that has been reared by its dam (Rommeck et al., 2009). Consequences of nursery rearing of nonhuman primates can be both physiological and psychological and can last into adulthood. Important consideration should be given to the necessity of nursery rearing, the importance of socialization, and in detail the infant\u2019s environment (Sackett et al., 2002; see Chapter 7).",

After BV infection of a macaque, the virus becomes latent in sensory ganglia, and reactivation can occur during periods of immunosuppression or stress (Chellman et al., 1992, Weigler et al., 1995). This virus is shed in secretions such as saliva and is readily transmitted, with most animals becoming seropositive by 2 years of age (Weigler et al., 1990, Weigler et al., 1993). Of the viruses targeted for elimination in SPF colonies, BV has proved most problematical (Ward et al., 2000, Ward and Hilliard, 2002). Various reports have documented a phenomenon of delayed seroconversion, in which an animal that has repeatedly tested BV seronegative unexpectedly develops antibodies (Ward and Hilliard, 1994). The occurrence of delayed BV seroconversion can jeopardize the integrity of SPF colonies many years after they have been founded. Although the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is not well understood, it is hypothesized to occur when animals are infected at a very early age and then a latent viral state is established before an adequate antibody response is developed.",

Although STLV appears to have minimal health consequences in immunocompetent macaques, it has been linked to lymphoproliferative disorders in AIDS (Homma et al., 1984). STLV has a low zoonotic potential and therefore has limited occupational health and safety risks; however, infection of macaques has been shown to alter cytokine profiles and thus could have a confounding effect on immunological studies, particularly those involving simian AIDs (Lazo and Bailer, 1996, Carvalho et al., 2001). For this reason, STLV has been targeted for elimination from SPF programs. The incidence of STLV infection within colonies varies dramatically, with reports of 0\u201320% of animals being infected (Daniel et al., 1988, Lerche et al., 1994, Schillaci et al., 2005). The virus is highly cell associated with primary tropism for CD4+ lymphocytes (Gabet et al., 2003). Transmission involves transfer of infected lymphocytes from one animal to another, and it is believed that sexual or parenteral routes of infection are responsible for the spread within colonies (Ishikawa et al., 1987). The highly cell-associated nature of STLV implies that it should be relatively easy to eradicate from colonies. Commercial ELISA assays for HTLV are available and due to cross-reactivity can be used for serological screening for STLV in colonies (Meertens et al., 2001). If seropositive animals are identified, samples should be sent to a commercial laboratory for confirmational testing using Western blot assays.",

To date, seven SRV-D serotypes have been recognized, and it has also been shown that marked genetic variation exists among individual isolates (Marx et al., 1984, Marracci et al., 1995). SRV-D exhibits broad cellular tropism, including cells of lymphoid and nonlymphoid lineages (Lackner et al., 1988). This expansive tropism increases the potential for spread of SRV-D between animals, as the virus can be secreted in many bodily fluids (Lerche, 1992, Gardner et al., 2000). Transmission can occur both horizontally and vertically, adding to the complexity of eliminating this virus from nonhuman primate colonies (Tsai et al., 1987, Lerche et al., 1994). Another confounding problem with eradicating SRV-D is the existence of animals that are virus positive but antibody negative (Wilkinson et al., 2003). This state normally arises when infection has occurred in utero or shortly after birth. To eliminate SRV-D from a colony, it is important to incorporate serological assays to screen for antibodies with PCR and virus isolation techniques to detect the cohort of antibody-negative/virus-positive animals. Cross-reactivity of antibodies between different serotypes is directed mainly at the major capsid protein p27 and transmembrane glycoprotein gp20\u201322. These conserved regions are commonly used in serological assays to test for SRV-D (Kuller et al., 2005, Khan et al., 2006). Viral isolation techniques involve culturing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with permissive cell lines such as Raji cells. If the animal is SRV-D positive, syncytial cell formation will normally be seen in approximately 3 weeks. Should syncytial cell formation occur, microscopic examination of the culture or PCR analysis should be performed. When PCR results are positive, the isolate should be sequenced to confirm that it is SRV-D rather than a closely related endogenous retrovirus (Morton et al., 2008).",

However, infection of Asian species of macaques results in the induction of an immunodeficient state that frequently progresses to AIDS (Baskin et al., 1988, Lackner et al., 1988). Although since 1980, SIV has not been documented in domestic nonhuman primate centers other than in those animals experimentally infected or those accidentally housed with infected animals, SIV has been included as a target virus for elimination from SPF programs. Because SIV is a group of closely related lentiviruses, serological testing routinely involves whole-virus preparations that contain conserved regions of the genome, i.e. the core p27 region (Morton et al., 2008). A test-and-remove strategy has proved effective in eliminating this virus from colonies; provided that stringent separation is maintained between experimentally infected and noninfected animals, inadvertent transmission of SIV should not occur.",

            "text": "Various diagnostic tests, including ELISA, immunofluorescent assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and viral isolation, are used in screening animals for these four target viruses. Samples may either be tested in house or sent to a commercial testing laboratory. On-site screening is inexpensive and may decrease time between seroconversion and removal of an animal from the colony. Details for the production of ELISA plates using purified whole-virus preparations for on-site screening can be found in the literature (Daniel et al., 1988, Blewett et al., 1999, Takano et al., 2001). Regardless of which test is used, when analyzing results it is important that the sensitivity and specificity of the test is understood (Gardner et al., 2000). The test specificity reflects the percentage of animals that are negative for the disease that the test accurately reports as negative, whereas the sensitivity reflects the ability of the test to identify truly positive animals. Regardless of the test used, false-positive and false-negative results will occur on occasion. Increased numbers of false-negative results may be seen during the early periods after formation of an SPF colony, whereas more false positives may be reported after the colony is established (Mansfield, 2005). Confirmational testing should always be performed at a reference laboratory when positive or questionable results are reported. To increase throughput, many commercial laboratories are now employing multiplex microbead immunoassay technology (Luminex Corp. Austin TX), which facilitates the concurrent detection of numerous pathogens in one sample (Khan et al., 2006).",

Depending on their geographical location and size, facilities may house their breeding groups in harems of 8\u201310 animals or in large outdoor corrals containing up to 150 individuals. In the formation of SPF colonies, harem breeding may be more advantageous, particularly in the initial period. In this configuration, seroconversion of one animal poses a threat of virus transmission to a maximum of 10 contact individuals. In contrast, seroconversion within corral housing can result in potential exposure of 100+ animals. Additionally, the testing and removal strategy for viral screening may be more efficiently accomplished in smaller group settings. Normally breeding harems are housed in indoor pens or outdoors in \u201ccorn cribs.\u201d Indoor housing may be beneficial if there are requirements for eradication of additional pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, and protozoa. At some facilities, breeding strategies such as timed-mating or assisted reproductive technologies are employed as an adjunct to harem or coral breeding. Both of these are useful in pathogen elimination and in the production of timed pregnancies for research protocols. However, these approaches are expensive to implement and frequently result in a reduction in colony reproductive performance.

These requirements will result in an onus on nonhuman primate breeding facilities to produce animals of ever-increasing quality. The ease at which animals of defined pathogenic and genetic background can be produced will vary from facility to facility, with housing strategies and infrastructure having a major impact. Indoor housing of macaques in small cohorts should facilitate the elimination of bacterial, protozoal, and parasitic pathogens if required. Harem housing also enables accurate identification of dams and sires of progeny and improves the ease of making clinical assessments. However, in contrast to corral breeding, production of macaques in harem groups can result in decreased genetic diversity of offspring produced and lower production rates. A strong veterinary and animal care program is central to the production of SPF macaques, and its importance should not be underestimated. Training programs for all personnel who have contact with the animals should include discussion of the routes of pathogen transmission, zoonotic potential of pathogens, and use of personal protective equipment. In addition, the importance of prompt reporting of clinical problems is essential to prevent disease outbreaks in the colony. Computerized medical, pathology, and demographic databases should be considered essential in colony management to aid in the identification of disease trends and housing, breeding, and pedigree data.",

Good integration is experienced by introducing a small group of new females to the male and allowing them to socialize for several hours, then returning the main group of female breeders to the group cage. Although establishing social rank may necessitate some physical altercations, the male is more apt to promote integration because of the bonds established by introducing new females in this manner.",

If a female steals another mother\u2019s infant, the practice has been to retrieve the infant and put the baby back on the mother. If it happens again and the baby stealer is lactating, she is allowed to keep the infant. Females are kept in breeding, and about three pregnancy losses or three infant deaths are allowed before that baboon is removed from breeding.

Olfaction is an important component of communication, and Aotus marks substrates by rubbing a gland at the base of its tail and exuding a brown, oily substance (Wolovich and Evans, 2007).",

Gestation is 133\u2013141 days (Gozalo and Montoya, 1990).

Infants may be hand-reared for short periods (around 3 weeks) and successfully reintroduced into either their original group or into an experienced group that has had visual and olfactory exposure to the infant while it was being hand-reared. Supernumerary infants may also be hand-reared by rotating a different infant out of the group each day (Ziegler et al., 1981).

Vaginal swabs or smears are taken by placing a cotton-tipped swab into the vaginal canal, preferably in the anterior fornix, and then visually examining the swab for the presence of blood.

The visible cyclic changes in the sex skin or perineum that correlate with the menstrual cycle have been well described in the baboon (Hendrickx, 1971). The turgescent phase encompasses an initial turgescent stage (average 4 days) when the perineal area starts to swell with a decrease in wrinkling of the skin, which changes color from dull pink to a pinkish red. During the subsequent maximum turgescent stage (average 13 days), the skin of the perineum is fully distended with no wrinkles and attains its deepest and most intense bright red color (Figure 8.1\na). The deturgescent phase is similarly divided into two stages. Initial deturgescence (average 5 days) begins with a loss of color, a decrease in size of the swelling, and a corresponding increase in wrinkles (Figure 8.1b). During the following quiescent stage (average 12 days), the perineum is of minimal size and the labia and clitoris have many wrinkles with an overall pinkish red color. The dull epithelial surface of the perineum, which begins to slough during the deturgescent stage, is usually completely shed by the end of the quiescent phase.",

Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) have been developed and applied to the detection of urinary estrone conjugates (E1C), progesterone metabolites, and LH. These results may be used for detection of ovulation and for monitoring reproductive function in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (Monfort et al., 1986, Monfort et al., 1987), marmosets and tamarins (Eastman et al., 1984, Harlow et al., 1984, Heger and Neubert, 1987), capuchin monkeys (Nagle et al., 1980), and squirrel monkeys (Travis and Holmes, 1974). In M. mulatta, E1C measurements in both nonconceptive and conceptive ovarian cycles demonstrate profiles that are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to measurements of circulating serum estradiol.",

A 1.5- to 2.0-fold E1C increase above the mean early follicular baseline has been observed 2 to 3 days before the E1C peak, which occurs in the majority of M. fascicularis between Days 8 and 15 of the menstrual cycle (Behboodi et al., 1991). These results are similar to those reported for women (Munro et al., 1991). A single 2-hour mating before or the day of the E1C peak resulted in a conception rate of 38.6%, which is comparable to a 40% conception rate in contemporary controls mated every other day over a 5-day period during midcycle (three times). In contrast, breeding 2 days prior to or 2 days after the peak significantly reduced the conception rate (Behboodi et al., 1991).",

Laparoscopic evaluation of folliculogenesis and ovulation have been conducted in prosimians and in a number of the New and Old World species (Dukelow et al., 1973, Dukelow, 1975, Dukelow and Ariga, 1976, Tardif et al., 1993). The dynamic changes in follicular structure and vascular patterns noted at laparoscopy have been used to identify the occurrence of ovulation within a short interval (approximately 6 hours) in Papio spp. (Wildt et al., 1977). Moreover, the sequential changes in ovarian follicular development have been correlated with perineal swelling, changes in vaginal cytology, and serum ovarian hormone levels (progesterone and estrogens). In most breeding colonies, the use of these procedures is normally restricted to situations in which confirmation of ovulation is needed or determination of a pathological condition is required. It should be noted that potential detrimental effects of general anesthesia and carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum on oocyte quality have been proposed (Lavy et al., 1988).",

CG is produced by the trophoblast and functions to prevent luteolysis; detection of CG is the basis for over-the-counter pregnancy tests in women. In the 1970s and 1980s, hemagglutination inhibition tests for urinary CG were developed for use in Old World monkeys. These tests include the Subhuman Primate Pregnancy Test Kit (SHPT) and the Nonhuman Primate Pregnancy Test (NHPPT) developed by Hodgen and Ross (1974) using an antiserum to the \u03b2 subunit of ovine LH, which is common to the CG of humans, gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. This antiserum is, however, dissimilar to FSH and LH of baboons and macaques. Only 0.2 ml of neat urine (or an equivalent amount of urine extract) is required for testing, and results are obtained within 3 hours after the samples are collected. This method is reliable for confirming pregnancy on gestation day (GD) 16 (fivefold concentration of urine required) or by GD 18 (neat urine tested). Collecting aliquots of freshly voided urine gives the most satisfactory result because it minimizes the time and collection of samples in addition to urine debris. This test became the method of choice for routine breeding management situations and has been used successfully in rhesus (Hodgen and Ross, 1974) and long-tailed macaques (Boot and Huisin\u2019t Veld, 1981), baboons (Hodgen and Niemann, 1975), and chimpanzees (Hodgen et al., 1976). Both false-positive and false-negative tests are reported, due in part to the variability in urinary macaque CG excretion from animal to animal.",

Measurement of Et alone was sufficient to detect and monitor pregnancy in most species. However, in some species it may be necessary to assess individual estrogens if a more precise evaluation is necessary.

Hartman (1932) was the first investigator to describe in detail the method of bimanual rectal palpation for accurately determining the stage of pregnancy by the size of the uterus and size of the fetal head and for following involution of the uterus postpartum. This palpation procedure is still useful for diagnosing pregnancy in both indoor and outdoor breeding colonies as long as it is performed by well-trained and experienced individuals. The examination is best done using ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaset; 10 mg/kg) or similar anesthesia with the animal lying on its side or placed in the supine position (Figure 8.2\n). In larger species (i.e. M. mulatta, M. nemestrina, Papio spp.), the examiner inserts the middle finger of the right hand into the rectum as far as possible, pressing toward the abdominal wall while placing the left hand ventrally for counterpressure. In smaller species (i.e. M. fascicularis), use of the little finger may be more appropriate. For most Old World monkeys, with the exception of large baboons, the entire length of the uterus may be appreciated if the animal is not pregnant or in the early stages of pregnancy; the ovaries may be identified on either side of the uterine body. The cervix in most macaques is readily distinguished by the sharp ridge marking its cranial border. The vagina is difficult to identify since it is collapsed against the symphysis pubis. If the ovaries are palpated, their size can be described by subjective terms such as \u201ctiny (infantile), small, medium, large, or very large.\u201d Wilson et al. (1970) devised a set of gauges covering the range of ovarian and uterine sizes; however, he found that palpation of the ovaries did not yield reliable information about reproductive events. Hartman (1932) and Mahoney, 1970, Mahoney, 1972, Mahoney, 1975 appear to be among the few who developed the skills required to obtain useful information by ovarian palpation of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis.\n",

Pregnancy is confirmed on the basis of size and consistency of the uterus until the 11th or 12th week (in macaques), at which time the head of the fetus can be palpated directly. Uterine palpation can be used to accurately diagnose pregnancy by GD 25 in M. mulatta and by GD 20\u201321 in the baboon provided that the day(s) of mating is known. Abdominal palpation can also be used to diagnose pregnancy in New World species. In the squirrel monkey, this method is reliable by the 6th week of gestation, when a 4- to 5-mm mass is detectable initially in the lower abdominal region cranial to the pelvis. The mass is larger and spongier by about 10\u201312 weeks (Kaplan, 1977). In the marmoset, estimates of uterine size based on external palpation have allowed formulation of an equation that permits prediction of parturition time (Gengozian et al., 1974, Phillips and Grist, 1975).",

            "text": "One of the more recent techniques employed to detect and monitor pregnancy in monkeys has been diagnostic ultrasound. This method provides a reliable means for evaluating and maintaining reproductive colonies in addition to its application for experimental purposes. For macaques, animals may be hand held by experienced animal handlers, placed in restraint chairs (if previously trained), or immobilized with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) for examinations. To detect pregnancy, the uterus is scanned transabdominally in both serial sagittal and transverse planes (Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988a, Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988d). Because of the characteristic thin abdominal wall in these species (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis), the high-frequency transducers (i.e. 7.5 or 10 MHz) provide optimal resolution and image quality. The uterus will usually be found midline, although anatomical variations and abdominal/pelvic adhesions can result in alternate locations. In many cases, the uterine body may be highly mobile and can be found flexed to the right, left, ventral (anteflexed), or dorsal (retroflexed) in relation to the cervix. This is frequently the case for females with an elongated lower uterine segment. In roughly 90% of all cases evaluated, a central linear echo is noted within the normal nongravid uterus. This echo represents the uterine \u201ccavity\u201d/interface between apposing layers of endometrium. The uterine or endometrial cavity echo (ECE) is a useful landmark for (1) identifying the uterus, (2) detecting early pregnancy, and (3) assessing uterine pathology.",

During this period of development, the ECE shows a slight irregularity, thickening, or split in the upper third of the uterine body (Figure 8.3\n). This represents the developing gestational sac (GS), which by GD 18 appears as an ovoid fluid-filled structure approximately 5.5 \u00b1 1.4 mm in mean diameter. Early pregnancy (GD 14 or 16\u201330) can be accurately detected and assessed using the sonographic developmental guidelines previously established (Table 8.6\n). These guidelines are useful for assessing early pregnancies at risk provided that normal developmental variation and methods for mating are kept in mind. In addition, no false positives or negatives result when incorporating these techniques (Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988d). Once pregnancy is identified, a variety of measurements [mean GS size, yolk sac diameter, greatest length (GL) of the embryo, and heart rate] are important for monitoring normal development (Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988a, Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988b, Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988c) (Table 8.7\n).",

This can be distinguished from early signs of threatened or impending abortion where intrauterine hemorrhage may be associated with hematoma formation. Both can result in extensive vaginal hemorrhage. Early resorptions can also be identified by an inappropriate GS size for the expected GD, poor development of the chorionic villi/placenta, or a diminishing GS when examined consecutively. A small volume of intrauterine fluid within an enlarged uterus is also suggestive of early abortion/resorption, although small volumes of intrauterine fluid may be observed in some nongravid animals during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.",

The standard sonographic evaluation performed during the second trimester (~GD 75\u201390) is incorporated in order to assess anatomical configuration, determine gender, monitor condition, and evaluate placental development. This is the optimal time for making judgments about conformation of the fetus since the volume of amniotic fluid (i.e. the ratio of fetus to the fluid volume) provides an excellent sonographic \u201cwindow.\u201d Development of the brain (i.e. lateral, third, and fourth ventricles; thalamus; midbrain; cerebellum; cerebral hemispheres; choroid plexus; cranial base), face (eyes, nose, mouth), heart, abdominal viscera, and axial and appendicular skeleton can all be assessed with accuracy. In addition, placental location (mono versus bidiscoid) and development (aging changes) are particularly important, especially when monitoring for placenta previa or placental abruptions. Those animals documented with either a marginal or a complete previa during the second trimester can be reevaluated later in gestation and scheduled for caesarean section, as required. It is important to rescan during the latter stages of development, as the placenta may \u201cmigrate\u201d (i.e. as the uterus grows, the discs are displaced craniad). Diagnosis of this condition requires accurate localization of the placenta in relation to the cervix on longitudinal scans. It should be noted that a distended urinary bladder may alter the relationship of the placenta to the cervix, which can lead to misinterpretation. Animals that display retroplacental or subchorionic hemorrhage are also closely monitored; if continued and considerable hemorrhage is noted, emergency surgery is performed. Of the nine concealed abruptions detected during three breeding seasons (GD 51\u2013125; 9/873 or 1%), no maternal deaths occurred. One interesting feature that has been frequently associated with abruptions is the proliferation of decidua, particularly near the lower uterine segment (Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988d). Continued surveillance within the colony for repeat incidence has resulted in the removal of females at risk and a resultant decrease in abruptions.",

Assessment of the magnitude of early embryonic mortality is additionally complicated by the occurrence of \u201cplacental sign\u201d (implantation bleeding), which is normally seen in macaques during early pregnancy. Morphological examinations of normal and abnormal embryos in the rhesus monkey (Heuser and Streeter, 1941) and baboon (Hendrickx and Binkerd, 1980) as well as the chimpanzee (Heuser, 1940) have provided information on embryonic death during the peri-implantation period.

In one large breeding population of common marmosets housed at the Southwest National Primate Research Center, the stillbirth rate was 16.6% (S. Tardif, unpublished observation).",

Studies carried out in rhesus monkeys indicate that normal prenatal growth is maintained on a protein-deficient diet due to the ability of the gravid nonhuman primate uterus to adapt to such nutritional restrictions (Riopelle, 1985). However, severe protein deprivation during pregnancy results in maternal as well as fetal mortality in this species (Kohrs et al., 1976). The effects of experimentally induced diabetes mellitus on fetal metabolism and well-being have also been examined in rhesus monkeys (Mintz et al., 1972). Administration of the pancreatic \u03b2 cell cytotoxin streptozotocin before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 27% mortality rate during the second and third trimesters. The drug effects included fetal hyperinsulinemia, enhanced pancreatic islet cell responsiveness, enlarged placentas, and polyhydramnios.",

Experiments carried out in rhesus monkeys to study the effect of maternal stress on pregnancy indicate that excitability and discomfort associated with labor and delivery may have deleterious effects on the fetus. Brief episodes of experimentally induced stress in near-term rhesus monkeys cause fetal deterioration in the form of fetal bradycardia and decreased arterial oxygenation (Morishima et al., 1978) or fetal asphyxia and concomitant disturbances in the acid\u2013base balance as a result of impaired uteroplacental circulation.

A variety of reproductive deficiencies were noted ranging from poor infant survival to a complete inhibition of ovulation and infertility. Specific hypothalamic factors (i.e. suppression of GnRH or LH/FSH) have been suggested as the mechanism responsible for these changes (e.g. Abbott et al., 1988). Although stress appeared to be contributory in New World species under these conditions and in Old World species as described earlier, other environmental effects such as airline travel and various forms of restraint and immobilization do not appear to result in an altered pregnancy outcome in captive macaques. It has been noted that for pigtailed, long-tailed, and rhesus macaques in addition to baboons, jet transport during various periods of gestation does not alter the rate of viable offspring (Sackett, 1981) or increase the rate of spontaneous abortion (A. G. Hendrickx, unpublished observations). Of the 154 pregnant rhesus females (GD 30\u2013150) shipped via air flight to other institutions for experimental purposes from 1982 to 1990, only 0.7% (1/154) produced a nonviable fetus upon arrival; no abortions either during or within 2 weeks of shipment were observed. Other studies have shown that daily capture of gravid pig-tailed macaques during GD 30\u2013130 does not alter gestational length or survival of the offspring (Newell-Morris et al., 1989). Experience at the CPRC indicates that frequent chair restraint and/or hand-catching by experienced animal handlers during all stages of pregnancy in both rhesus and long-tailed macaques do not affect pregnancy maintenance or outcome (Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988b, Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1989).",

Research model specifications minimally address a defined species, health status, gender, and maturity. Since the early 1960s in the USA, the National Institutes of Health began planning and implementing programs to generate nonhuman primate research models for use in federally funded research. (Whitehair, 1999). For decades after inception, the National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) relied on feral or bred nonhuman primates from foreign suppliers to replace and expand breeding stock. Similarly, commercial and academic institutions conducting research with nonhuman primates relied primarily on animals imported from their native countries of origin. Today, the NPRCs are more self-sustaining. Additionally, there are several established commercial breeders of research nonhuman primates in the USA. However, to meet the demand for research quality nonhuman primates, in particular cynomolgus macaques; there is still a critical need to import animals from breeding programs outside the USA and Canada. In this discussion, it should be noted that although a large portion of research involving nonhuman primates remains in North America, the countries of Japan, Europe, and China also conduct significant nonhuman primate research. Furthermore, other Asian countries are working in this field. The geographical distribution of nonhuman primate research is not static. The term \u201cforeign breeding source\u201d in this chapter is meant to define sites apart from the USA and Canada.

Several \u201cin country\u201d commercial breeders of cynomolgus macaques also began in the mid-1980s, including captive breeding programs in the Philippines (1983) and in Mauritius (1985) (Hobbs et al., 1987, Stanely, 2002). China began developing captive breeding of imported cynomolgus monkeys to supply biomedical research in 1985. It is interesting to note that cynomolgus monkeys are not native to China and that Chinese cynomolgus breeding centers have imported animals from several origin countries. China had programs for captive breeding of domestic rhesus monkeys in 1978 for both conservation and research purposes. (Hsu and Jia 2003). The drive to breed monkeys for research in source countries reflects the situation during the 1980s when the majority of cynomolgus monkeys imported to the USA were feral source and shipped from Indonesia and the Philippines. By 1994, Indonesia had enacted guidance to cease export of feral nonhuman primates (Pamungkas and Sajuthi, 2003), and the Philippines followed suit shortly thereafter.",

Of the total imports, 92.3% were cynomolgus macaques, 5.0% rhesus macaques, and 1.5% African green monkeys. New World species, represented by squirrel monkeys and marmosets, combined for 0.7%. The relatively small remainder of the imports included 10 other nonhuman primate species.

Another important point of review is whether the colony is closed or receiving expansion/replacement breeders from an outside source.

Variation in test and reference data between subspecies of nonhuman primates has been reported. Such differences may include a subspecies\u2019 response in infectious disease research, immunological expression, physiological and biochemical parameters, breeding performance, and even behavior. Such findings have been noted in squirrel monkeys, baboons, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus macaques (Abee, 2000, Williams-Blangero et al., 2002, Williams-Blangero and VandeBerg, 2003, Leuchte et al., 2004, Kawamoto et al., 2007, Stevison and Kohn, 2008, Van Andel et al., 2008). It should be noted that morphological inspection alone may be inadequate for distinguishing subspecies or hybrid animals. Ideally, to be able to compare data from various research studies and, further, to manage consistency within control and test animals, it is preferable to use a single sub-species that is genetically and physiologically well defined. Genetic admixture and hybrid animals can impart differences in response to test articles or procedures, which may confound results. (Williams-Blangero and VandeBerg, 2003)",

These animals were imported from China, Mauritius, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines (Mullan, 2009). The genetic character of all these animals is not consistent across all sources but varies as a reflection of the wild cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) population from which the parents were derived. Furthermore, variability may arise from human influence if animals of different genetic backgrounds are intermixed in breeding. In general, the captive breeding colonies of Macaca fascicularis are derived from one of three populations of free-ranging cynomolgus monkeys or an admixture of these three populations. These three sources include cynomolgus derived from Indochina, Insular Asia (Indonesia, Philippines), and a Mauritian cynomolgus group (Stevison and Kohn, 2008). The last is a species introduced to the island of Mauritius between 400 and 500 years ago, likely from a relatively very small founder population originating in Java and/or Sumatra (Stanely, 2002, Tosi and Coke, 2007, Blancher et al., 2008, Stevison and Kohn, 2008). The insular cynomolgus macaques split from the continental Indochinese cynomolgus approximately 1 million years ago (Blancher et al., 2008). Cynomolgus macaques of the Philippines appear to have originated 40 000 to 110 000 years ago, by natural or human-assisted colonization of an Indonesian founder population in the Philippines (Smith et al., 2007, Blancher et al., 2008). Genetic evidence indicates that Indochinese cynomolgus macaques were influenced by genetic inflow from rhesus macaques, both in the past and possibly to current times. This event occurs to varying degrees in geographically distinct intergrade zones of co-habitation on the mainland (Leuchte et al., 2004, Kanthaswamy et al., 2008, Stevison and Kohn, 2008, Stevison and Kohn, 2009). Indochinese cynomolgus breeding animals originating from widely different locations may display varying proportions of hybridization, and this may have important implications on their study use, depending upon the type of research to be conducted using the offspring. It might be preferable to keep local populations of Indochinese animals segregated in breeding systems in order to produce a consistent model (Stevison and Kohn, 2008).",

This characteristic of low variability in MHC class I alleles found in Mauritian monkeys may make them good candidates for studies requiring identical or well-defined test cohorts relative to MHC I and II. Research where this characteristic may be beneficial includes immunological studies such as HIV vaccine trials and other infectious disease or organ/tissue transplant studies (Leuchte et al., 2004, Krebs et al., 2005, Van Andel et al., 2008, Stevison and Kohn, 2008). Indonesian cynomolgus reportedly are a very good model for studying human pneumonic plague and possibly other human infectious diseases (Van Andel et al., 2008). Toxicology and other specific research may have goals and concerns in using cynomolgus monkeys with low genetic variability. These populations may have \u201clost\u201d specific genes over generations, which could confer a susceptibility to a certain disease (Smith et al., 2007).",

It should be pointed out that similar to genetic, behavioral, and research differences reported for various origins of Macaca fascicularis, genetic, behavioral, and research differences also exist between both Chinese wild and captive-bred rhesus macaques and Indian-derived rhesus macaques (Satkoski et al., 2008). Indian-derived rhesus monkeys have been bred domestically by the NPRCs following the embargo on the export of rhesus from India in 1978. Indian rhesus are highly sought for use in HIV vaccine research, transplant studies, and other immunology research due to their relatively well defined and unique MHC I presentation. This feature is of value in evaluating immune responses between various test groups in a study. Interestingly, the mtDNA of Chinese rhesus more closely matches that of the Taiwanese (Macaca cyclopis) and the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) than it does the Indian rhesus monkey. Furthermore, free-ranging Chinese rhesus populations show significant differences in genetic character based upon geographical division across an East\u2013West mapping. Rhesus monkeys in captive breeding in China may in some cases represent an admixture of breeders from different wild Chinese populations (Satkoski et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Foreign-sourced research nonhuman primates are expected to be defined with respect to specific pathogen-free (SPF) status. Depending upon the location of the breeder, certain obstacles may need to be addressed relative to managing SPF production. Implementation of site-specific protocols addressing species-specific disease surveillance, preventative medicine, occupational health, and zoonoses training of employees are necessary. When breeding units are exposed to the outdoors, there may be concerns related to endemic parasitic diseases with specific intermediate hosts or vectors (Plasmodium sp., microfilaria, trematodes, cestodes) that are uncommon or not found within the USA. In this regard, foreign suppliers may have instituted both preventative programs and prophylactic treatment to block transmission of these parasites. Continued surveillance for these parasites upon arrival of these animals in the USA should still be practiced. The risk of animals\u2019 exposure to certain zoonotic disease may be related to a high prevalence of the disease within the colony\u2019s employees or their familial contacts. Such disease examples may include rubeola, Shigella sp., and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All nonhuman primate breeding programs must address occupational health and use of primary or personal protective equipment relative to human / nonhuman primate interactions. Macaque breeding colonies often have a goal of producing SPF animals (free of SRV, STLV-1, and B virus), but this goal may pose a diagnostic challenge due to the lack of local or in-house test systems with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, when PCR capability is needed, there may be obstacles in sending samples to a distant laboratory. This is a critical point when trying to maintain an SPF macaque colony or introduce new animals for expansion or as replacement breeders. Similarly, when investigating suspicious disease outbreaks, it may be difficult to find local laboratories capable of performing preferred diagnostics (e.g. direct PCR or culture for Mycobacterium). Retrieving permits to ship samples out of the country may hinder expedient delivery of samples to a qualified laboratory.",

On occasion there may still be difficulty in obtaining fixed-formula ingredients. The goal is to provide a stable, contaminant-free formulated chow that meets NRC guidelines for the given species. Local feed producers should have a qualified nutritionist on staff and be equipped with an adequate means of analyzing the diet being produced for the breeding colony. Animal drinking water must also be regularly evaluated as to source, safety, and sanitation.",

In some cases there may be disparity in the level of formal training when comparing numerous breeding operations. In such cases, a practical approach is warranted. Furthermore, although there may be local governance of breeding and transporting nonhuman primates, AAALAC accreditation is useful for assessing the animal care and welfare standards. The level of both responsibility and program input by the veterinary staff is another important factor. Attention to the response of management to the veterinary staff\u2019s input may reflect on the program\u2019s overall quality.

Transportation challenges may include maintaining the biosecurity of the animals; safety of animals and human contacts; impact of public perception of research nonhuman primates as cargo; meeting the vital husbandry needs of the species during transit, and compliance with numerous regulatory agencies (Elmore, 2008). Over the past 20 years, numerous air carriers transiting through Europe have abandoned nonhuman primate cargo, in part due to animal rights campaigns as well as public perception of risk following disease outbreaks that publicized a link to nonhuman primates. Consider as examples the popular press handling of issues related to Ebola/Reston, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome (SAIDS). In the past, difficulties arranging importation of nonhuman primate cargo through Europe led to chartered aircraft importation of nonhuman primates, but that imposed a significant business expense on the importation process. It should be noted that these difficulties in air transportation have not occurred with imports from China using Chinese air carriers.",
