Possible interactions between HBoV1 and other viruses have also been discussed.6 We studied the role of HBoV1 in childhood RTI by comparing its presence in children hospitalised with RTI with a control group of symptom-free children admitted to elective surgery. We also looked for several other respiratory pathogens in order to evaluate their coexistence with HBoV1.",

Nucleic acid was extracted with NucliSens\u00aeeasyMag\u00ae (bioMerieux). All PCRs were in-house real-time assays based on TaqMan probes. The analyses were carried out as part of the daily laboratory routine and mainly performed within 24 h after sample collection. The target for the HBoV1-PCR was the NP-1 gene; the primers and probe have been previously described.7 Quantitative standards for the real-time HBoV1-PCR assay were made by cloning a plasmid (pCR\u00ae4-TOPO\u00ae) containing the PCR product. The amount of nucleic acid was measured and serial dilutions covering a range of seven logs were made. The viral load in each sample was recorded semi-quantitatively and grouped in three categories: high viral load (106\u20131010\n copies ml\u20131), medium viral load (104\u2013106\n copies ml\u20131) and low viral load (103\u2013104\n copies ml\u20131). The reportable range of the assay was from 1000 copies ml\u20131 (20 copies per reaction) to 1010\n copies ml\u20131. In addition, plasma samples available from 60 of the 144 HBoV1-positive children were examined with the HBoV1-PCR.",

However, an even higher viral load (>2 \u00d7 108 copies ml\u20131) was seen only in children with RTI. Furthermore, an association was found between a high viral load (>106 copies ml\u20131) and infection in the lower respiratory tract. This finding may indicate that high viral load is associated with more severe disease, and may represent a dose-effect argument for a causal relation between HBoV1 and RTI.",

Most patients with viraemia, high viral load and LRTI in our study were in the 12\u201317 months age group, the age at which most children have lost the protection of maternal antibodies. In the older children, however, the majority of the HBoV1-detections could represent asymptomatic re-infections, reactivations of latent/persistent infections or long-time virus shedding. Reactivation of other human pathogenic parvoviruses is known to happen.14, 15 Further studies on this issue are needed.",

Patients admitted for ear, nose and throat surgery were not included in the control group because many of these diseases may be related to viral infections.

Enterovirus can be detected in samples from patients several weeks after infection,19 and shedding of HBoV1 over long periods has recently been documented.17, 20 Thus, HBoV1 and enterovirus seem to share a common tendency for prolonged shedding, which may explain their frequent co-detection. A criterion of 2 weeks without respiratory symptoms before inclusion in the control group is, in this context, relatively short. Long-time virus shedding is therefore a plausible explanation for the high occurrence of HBoV1 in our control group. It has previously been shown that strong immune stimuli can cause reactivation of adenovirus in adenoid tissue,21 and therefore we speculate that the association between HBoV1 and adenovirus may be associated with reactivation of the latter. Reactivation of HBoV1, an alternative or supplementary explanation, has yet to be demonstrated. As expected, RSV was common in children with RTI and rare among controls, appearing at similar rates in children with or without HBoV1, which indicates the dominance of RSV. Similarly, for each of the other viruses studied, co-detection of HBoV1 did not increase the frequency of RTI (Table 2). Cultures for bacteria were included in the study in order to look for interactions with viruses, but no such interactions were seen for HBoV1. Therefore, our findings do not support the existence of significant interactions between HBoV1 and other respiratory viruses or bacteria. However, more studies are needed to clarify these complex matters.",
