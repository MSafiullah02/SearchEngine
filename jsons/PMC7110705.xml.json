Up to April 2016 more than 1360 cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia alone with a mortality rate that exceeded 40% [8]. Though the disease is believed to be zoonotic with strong evidence towards a camel reservoir [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], major outbreaks are believed to be nosocomial involving transmission within health care facilities [2], [15], [16], [17], [18].",

Male predominance, which was observed in almost every surveillance study [17], [19], [20], [21] could be related to the culture in Saudi Arabia, where women wear veils that cover both the nose and mouth and may help protect from exposure, along with decreased outdoor activities compared to men.
