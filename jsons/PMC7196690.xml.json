Aside from rhinovirus infection, which has been shown to occur following contact of the nasal and conjunctival mucosa with fingertips seeded with virus,(1) the evidence for the hand contact route is indirect albeit substantial. Intervention studies conducted in senior daycare facilities,(2) student dormitories,(3) military barracks,(4) and households(5) have shown that increased handwashing and/or hand treatment with an iodine solution decreased respiratory tract illnesses by 20% or more relative to the incidence in control groups. A meta-analysis of eight selected intervention studies geared toward the general public showed a 24% decrease in respiratory illness relative to control groups due to handwashing measures.(6) Given these overall findings, recent pandemic influenza planning documents identify hand contact as a potential exposure route,(7) even though this pathway never has been experimentally demonstrated for seasonal influenza A virus.",

Other risk factors include the rate of hand contact with environmental surfaces, the degree of contamination of the touched surfaces, the transfer efficiency on touching, and the infectivity (virulence) of the pathogen. A reasonable qualitative statement is that infection risk increases as the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes increases. However, a more quantitative description is desirable. Because there are sparse published data concerning the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes, the authors conducted a limited observational study of that rate. The authors also developed a mathematical framework that uses hand contact rate information to estimate the pathogen dose to target facial membranes and relates this dose to infection risk.",

Each subject was paid a small amount for participating. Subsequent to the 10 sessions, the same investigator (DB) viewed the tapes and counted the number of times each subject touched his/her eyes, nostrils, and lips. Descriptive statistics (the sample mean and standard deviation) were computed for the touch frequencies. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed for the three pairwise combinations of touch frequencies (lips-eyes, lips-nostrils, eyes-nostrils), and tests of the hypothesis that the rank correlation coefficients exceeded zero were performed.(8) The study design was reviewed and approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, University of California, Berkeley.",

Evidence for such site-specific differences would be the observation that to achieve infection of 50% of test subjects (or animals), inhalation of far fewer pathogens is required if the pathogens are carried on respirable particles compared with inspirable but nonrespirable particles. This circumstance must be considered because few if any pathogens deposited on target facial membranes will penetrate into the respiratory tract past the epiglottis; thus, using an \u03b1 estimate based on a respirable pathogen inhalation study may be inappropriate.
