For the clinical outcomes of interest, there was one randomized-controlled trial (RCT)-based health economic evaluation, and six model-based health economic evaluations. Probiotics showed favourable costeffectiveness in six of seven (86%) economic evaluations. Three of the seven studies were manufacturer-supported, all which suggested cost-effectiveness. Certainty of costeffectiveness evidence was very low because of risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. Conclusion Probiotics may be an economically attractive intervention for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized adult patients. Nevertheless, certainty about their costeffectiveness evidence is very low. Future RCTs examining probiotics should incorporate cost data to inform bedside practice, clinical guidelines, and healthcare policy.

Malgr\u00e9 leurs bienfaits potentiels, il n'existe aucune donn\u00e9e sommative examinant la rentabilit\u00e9 des probiotiques chez des patients hospitalis\u00e9s.

Probiotics are defined as ''live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.'' 1 Mechanisms by which probiotics offer potential health benefits are not yet fully elucidated. They may include enhanced gut barrier function, reduced gastrointestinal pathogenic bacterial load through competitive inhibition, modification of the gut microbiome, and modulation of the host immune system. These effects may reduce the incidence of healthcareassociated infections. 2, 3 Probiotics have been studied in randomized-controlled trials (RCT) in a variety of conditions in the hospital setting with evidence suggesting benefits, including the reduction of healthcare-associated infections. 4, 5 In the intensive care unit (ICU), probiotics have been studied for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 3, 6 Multiple probiotic strains (i.e., Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces) and doses have been systematically reviewed; a meta-analysis revealed a risk reduction of 0.74 for VAP (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.90; P = 0.002), showing a potential effect across species. 6 As the most common healthcare-associated infection in ICU, VAP is associated with a two-fold attributable risk of death, and an attributable cost of 10,000-13,000 USD/patient. 7 Further evidence suggests that probiotics can reduce the incidence of diarrhea, specifically Clostridioides difficileassociated diarrhea (CDAD), which can cause pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and death. 8 A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 RCTs including 8,672 patients receiving concurrent administration of probiotics (any dose, any strain) and antibiotics showed that probiotics prevented CDAD compared with placebo (based on moderate certainty evidence), with heterogeneous evidence for a specific species or dose effect. 8 Treatment for CDAD is expensive (8,911-30,049 USD/patient). 9 Among critically ill patients, the clinical effectiveness of probiotics in preventing VAP, CDAD, and other infectious outcomes was evaluated in a recently completed but as yet unpublished multicentre RCT (Probiotics: Prevention of Severe Pneumonia and Endotracheal Colonization Trial -PROSPECT; NCT01782755), with additional RCTs ongoing (PRINCESS: Probiotics to reduce infections in care home residents; ISRCTN16392920).",

[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] The time horizon (duration of time for follow-up, over which health outcomes and costs are calculated) ranged from three to 52 weeks. A probiotic manufacturer supported three of seven (43%) studies. 20, 22, 24 Study quality and risk of bias Study quality is summarized in Table 2 . Two studies obtained effectiveness data from meta-analysis, 21,23 while seven studies obtained data from RCTs or observational trials. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] All performed sensitivity analyses. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] For assessing ROB in RCTs (eAppendix 4A [available as ESM]), three studies 19-21 had a low ROB, while four studies 28-31 had unclear/high ROB. Common ROB issues were selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias. For observational study ROB (eAppendix 4B [available as ESM]), there were six high-quality cohort observational studies, 25,28,29,32-34 and ten low-quality cohort studies. 26, 30, 31, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Common ROB were selection (only selected group of patients representing the intervention cohort, no description of non-exposed nonintervention cohort, and no demonstration that outcome of interest was absent at the start of the study), comparability (study did not control for age, antibiotic/probiotic exposure, or additional factors), and outcome (short follow-up).",

Ventilator-associated pneumonia One evaluation investigated VAP ( Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea Among six studies examining the cost-effectiveness of probiotics in CDAD (Table 3) , four studies found probiotics to be cost-effective/incremental costsaving, 20,22-24 one study showed no difference, 19 and one study showed cost-effectiveness in certain scenarios. 23 Kamdeu Fansi et al. found a cost-savings dose response for probiotics vs placebo. There was a cost-saving of 1,968 USD (2,152 CAD) for a single dose of probiotics (per CDAD case prevented) compared with placebo. For a double dose of probiotics per day, there was a cost-saving of 2,661 USD (2,910 CAD) compared with placebo. 20 Leal et al. showed cost-savings of 538 CAD per patient (340 CAD for probiotics vs 878 CAD for usual care) for CDAD. 21 Shen et al. showed a cost-saving of 840 USD (1,150 CAD) per case of CDAD averted, with dominance of probiotics (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in the base case. Nevertheless, there were scenarios (i.e., young patients) in which the ICER was not cost-effective (age, 18-44 yr; CDAD risk, 0.6%: ICER, 884,100 USD/qualityadjusted life-year [QALY] and 1,196,609 CAD/QALY). 23 Furthermore, Allen et al. showed there was no difference in total healthcare costs between probiotics (\u00a38020; 95% CI, 7620 to 8420 and (15,629 CAD; 95% CI, 14,850 to 16,409) and placebo (\u00a38010; 95% CI, 7600 to 8420 and 15,601 CAD; 95% CI, 14,811 to 16,409). 19 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea Among three studies examining the cost-effectiveness of probiotics for AAD (Table 3) , two studies found probiotics to be cost-effective, 22, 24 with one study showing no difference between probiotics and placebo. 19 Lenoir-Wijnkoop et al. showed a mean cost-saving of \u00a3339 (642.94 CAD) per hospitalized patient for probiotics vs no treatment for prevention of AAD. 22 Vermeersch et al. found cost-savings of \u20ac50.30 (75.74 CAD) using a bottomup approach and \u20ac28.10 (42.31 CAD) using a top-down approach per AAD patient treated with antibiotics from a payer's perspective. From a hospital/societal perspective, there was a cost-saving of \u20ac95.20 (143.35 CAD) (bottomup) and \u20ac14.70 (22.13 CAD) (top-down) per AAD patient treated with probiotics. 19 Conversely, Allen et al. found that probiotics were not cost-effective, with an ICER for AAD prevention of \u00a34531. 36 (\u00a33,439.80-\u00a35,622.92; 8,830.58 CAD [6,703.39-10,957 .79]), and a base-case cost-utility of \u00a3189,662 (369,608 CAD) per QALY, for a WTP threshold of \\ \u00a320,000 (38,975 CAD)/QALY. 19 Sponsorship, economic perspective, trial vs. modelbased, and placebo vs. no probiotic subgroup comparisons Overall, of the seven studies included, six (86%) economic evaluations favoured probiotics as cost-effective/costsaving in the base case.

There was no pooled estimate with a 95% CI, as the outcomes for some of the studies were not available or were too heterogeneous to pool (i.e., cost per treatment [with multiple dose regimens of probiotics] vs incremental cost-effectiveness ratios vs cost-utility vs cost-savings). d Confidence interval crosses 0 for Allen et al 19 . study, and many of the included studies were small e Included RCT, decision tree analysis, and systematic reviews/meta-analyses were used for source data (6 RCTs) health economic evaluation to date found no difference in clinical outcomes, and no cost-effectiveness/cost-utility. 19 The conclusions drawn from the collective studies in this systematic review are based on very low certainty evidence from the ROB and GRADE assessments, precluding strong inferences or definitive recommendations regarding probiotics. We found no prior systematic reviews that focused on economic evaluations of probiotic prophylaxis in hospitalized patients, hence we conducted our own. Among economic evaluations included in this review, incremental costs/ICERs were expressed in costs per healthcare-associated infection event prevented, but heterogeneity in reporting prevented meta-analysis conduction. 47 Multifaceted quality improvement programs for reducing CLABSIs in ICUs have shown dominance (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in 80% of model scenarios using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 48 A proactive model infection-control program for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms in general-surgical ICUs showed an ICER of 3,804 USD (5,320.01 CAD) per case averted of transmission of MDR organisms in one year compared with standard infection control. For a WTP threshold of 14,000 USD (19,579.43 CAD) per transmission averted, there is a 42% probability of being cost-effective, and 100% probability when WTP thresholds were 22,000 USD (30, 767 .68 CAD). 49 These similarities suggest that adoption of probiotics for prevention of healthcareassociated infections could be cost-effective.",

To this end, an economic evaluation of PROSPECT (E-PROSPECT) is planned.",

Changes in time horizons or perspectives can lead to differing parameters (costs [direct vs indirect], or outcomes [patient vs payer]). Many studies only reported incremental costs rather than true ICERs. Results from different perspectives, time horizons, and variable incremental cost reporting all represent disparate cost outcomes, which need to be interpreted carefully within context. Moreover, there are large ranges in WTP, which are difficult to interpret with no conventional WTP benchmarks for prevention of VAP, CDAD, and AAD. Different countries may differ on values quality of life and WTP, making benchmarks difficult to establish across jurisdictions. Cost-utility parameters (like cost per life-year or QALY gained) were less commonly reported. If cost per QALYs were available, it would help to inform economic comparisons with other healthcare interventions. Compared with other infection-prevention strategies, probiotics appear to be similarly cost-effective. A study examining concomitantly administered central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSIs) and VAP programs combined documented ICERs of 14,250.74 USD (20,533.24 CAD)/life-year gained and 23,277.86 USD (33,540.02 CAD)/QALY.",
