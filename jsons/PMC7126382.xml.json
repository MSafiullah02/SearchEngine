            "text": "Lipids play crucial roles at various stages of host\u2013virus interactions from the virus entry to intracellular trafficking and virus release (Chew et al., 1994, Marsh and Helenius, 2006, Wenk, 2006). Viruses acquire and enrich specific classes of lipids into their envelope structures to increase their infectivity (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006, Choi et al., 2005, Mercer and Helenius, 2008). Selective depletion of one lipid class from enveloped viruses can reduce viral infectivity (Goluszko and Nowicki, 2005). On the other hand, compositional changes of cellular lipids are implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, stress and viral infection (Bravo et al., 2005, German et al., 2007, van Meer et al., 2008, Vukelic and Kalanj-Bognar, 2001, Wenk, 2006). However, in comparison to many extensive studies of genomes and proteomes, lipidomic studies of viruses and their producer cells are limited and primarily focused on mammalian enveloped viruses (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006, Choi et al., 2005, McSharry and Wagner, 1971, Mercer and Helenius, 2008, Schlesinger et al., 1973).",

This lipidomic study on the precise composition of SGIV lipids provides complementary information, which is necessary for understanding the viral lipid\u2013protein interaction, entry process, intracellular trafficking, assembly and egress. A combined approach of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry was used to quantitatively analyze the lipid composition of intracellular SGIV and a grouper embryonic cell (GEC) line in which SGIV replicated. Compared with traditional TLC methods, this analytical approach provides highly selective, sensitive and quantitative determination of lipid molecules in a mixture (Guan et al., 2006, Schwudke et al., 2007). More than 220 species of lipid molecules were measured. We found that the lipid composition of SGIV is significantly different from that of other viruses reported. In addition, ten viral capsid proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS and five of them were confirmed to be lipid-binding proteins. We demonstrated that viral lipids are important for viral integrity and infectivity.",

A high resolution picture from cryo-EM may help to reveal such membrane structure as it was observed in Chilo iridescent virus (Yan et al., 2009). The outer layer of SGIV was much thicker than a common viral envelope which is typically of 5\u20138 nm thickness. In addition, there was no visible gap between the SGIV outer layer and capsid shell. These observations suggest that the outmost layer may closely interact with the capsid shell and differs significantly from the typical envelope structure of other viruses.",

Regarding SGIV, a majority of viral particles were released from infected cells following cell lysis. To characterize the chemical features of the outer layer of intracellular SGIV, purified particles were treated with ether and DDM. After the treatment with 75% ether, the outer layer became less dense and distorted (Fig. 1d). Treatment with 0.4 mM DDM removed the outer layer (Fig. 1e), but the capsid shell was retained, and viral particles became round. We also observed that the morphology of the viral particles was completely damaged after 50% (v/v) chloroform treatment (data not shown). Overall our data suggest that the outer layer of intracellular SGIV particles might contain lipids that are important in maintaining the viral structure.",

When normalized to appropriate internal standards, individual classes of lipids (and their individual members) can be presented as a molar percentage of total lipids (Guan et al., 2006). The results are summarized in Table 1\nand Supplementary data Fig. S3. The major phospholipid components of SGIV consisted of PC, ePC, PI and SM (Table 1). The molar ratios of PI (18.85 \u00b1 0.98) were higher than those of PE (2.28 \u00b1 0.51), pPE (4.25 \u00b1 1.51) and PS (1.97 \u00b1 0.45). This high proportion of PI in SGIV is distinctive from its relative abundance in reported mammalian viruses, in which the molar ratio of PI was greatly lower than those of PE, pPE and PS (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006; McSharry and London, 1971; Schlesinger et al., 1973). The relative high proportion of PI was also observed in an iridescent virus type 6 analyzed by TLC (Balange-Orange and Devauchelle, 1982) and other invertebrate iridescent viruses analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (Williams and Thompson, 1995), suggesting that the high abundance of PI might be a common feature of iridoviruses. Among the invertebrate iridoviruses, the major fatty acids were C18:1 and C16:0, taking approximate 50% of total fatty acids. However, the three most abundant PI species of SGIV were PI 36:2, -38:3 and -38:4, representing a total of 56% of 18 PI species measured (Supplementary Fig. S3), which were different from the fatty acid contents of invertebrate iridoviruses.",

The Chol/PC ratio of SGIV was higher than that of GECs. It was believed that higher molar ratio of Chol may help stabilization of viral lipid layer in mammalian viruses (Laliberte et al., 2007, Megha and London, 2004). In addition, the coexistence of the two forms of infectious viruses, namely extracellular and intracellular viruses, was observed and intensively studied in rabies viruses (Schlesinger et al., 1973) and vaccinia viruses (Mercer and Helenius, 2008, Roberts and Smith, 2008). However, we failed to isolate such enveloped extracellular viruses despite enormous efforts including using classical sucrose and potassium tartrate gradients. The enveloped viruses were only observed occasionally by electron micrography of ultrathin sections of infected cells (Chew et al., 1994, Qin et al., 2001). It reaffirmed that SGIV infection produces the two forms of mature virions, but a vast majority are the intracellular virions.",

OG and DDM are mild detergents and commonly used in protein crystallization to improve protein solubility while retaining proteins in their natural conformations. Treatment with 0.4 mM DDM abolished viral infectivity by 99.99%, a drop of viral titer from 106.54 to 102.54. However, OG seemed less effective in reducing infectivity when it was used at the same concentration as DDM. Treatment with 0.4 mM OG reduced infectivity by just 30%. Interestingly, it was reported that disruption of the lipid bilayer in invertebrate iridescent viruses had a profound effect on their ability to infect cultured cells but not to infect whole insects when the virus was injected into the haemocoel (Martinez et al., 2003), suggesting that viruses may take different routes to establish an infection in vivo from in vitro.

Studies of human viruses indicated that viral entry involves single lipid species and lipid raft (Laliberte and Moss, 2009, Marsh and Helenius, 2006). A study of FV3, a prototype of Ranavirus, proposed that the enveloped viral particle were internalized by endocytosis, while uneveloped particles entered the host cells by fusion between the virus shell and the cellular membranes (Braunwald et al., 1985).

Treatment with LPA2 resulted in a general hydrolysis of phospholipids, and SM was retained in the virus. When SGIV was incubated with PLC, PI was specficially hydrolyzed and other lipids did not seem to be affected. However, the treatment with SMase resulted in the removal of SM species as well as other phospholipids. These results suggest that SM and phospholipids may be arranged so that phospholipids are situated in the outer surface of the viral outer layer or that SM may link to other viral components such as capsid proteins. On the other hand, PI, which was found to be in a higher abundance than many other lipids, did not appear to have such an interconnection with other lipids since its loss was specific.",

ORF075 was one of the abundant structure proteins (Song et al., 2006), showing an obvious reduction in treated viral particles (Supplementary Fig S4a). ORF52L and ORF60R with a predicted molecular mass of 109 kDa were identified from the gel bands at a migration distance equivalent to a 40-kDa entity. This result indicated that these two proteins might be fragmented by 0.4 mM DDM treatment and migrated faster during SDS-PAGE. The protein peptides corresponding to these proteins were therefore identified from the location of 40 kDa entity. Proteins listed in Table 2 are promising targets for identification of lipid binding proteins and viral surface proteins. In contrast, enzyme treatments did not cause obvious changes in viral protein profiles examined by SDS-PAGE or obvious changes in viral morphology by EM observation (data not shown).",

            "text": "Taken together, although both lipase and detergent treatments reduced viral infectivity in our experimental conditions; DDM (0.4 mM) triggered a more serious loss of infectivity than did the lipases. This may be because the DDM treatment leaded to the dissociation of both lipids and proteins from the viral particles, whereas the lipase treatments only depleted certain lipids from the viral particles. Selective depletion of enriched viral lipids did result in the reduction of infectivity, but that reduction was limited. It is interesting to note that the conformation of proteins that play a role in membrane fusion during viral entry is affected by surrounding lipids in HIV, influenza virus and SARS coronavirus (Qiang and Weliky, 2009, Guill\u00e9n et al., 2008). When the fusion peptide (FP, the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 gp41) was associated with cholesterol-containing membranes, the FP correlated with beta strand conformation while association with membranes without cholesterol resulted in a mixture of helical and beta strand conformations. Studies of SARS FP revealed that the peptide organization is different depending if it is in water or bound to the membrane. Our results hint at the cooperation roles of viral lipids and proteins in the viral infectivity. The association of lipids and viral capsid proteins may be involved in the merging of the viral external layer and target cell membranes.",

Each lipid-binding protein showed a different affinity to different lipid species, so that each protein may contribute differently to the overall complexity of viral lipids. It has been demonstrated that PIP2 is involved in viral entry process and replication in HIV (Barrero-Vilar et al., 2008) and influenza viruses (Ehrhardt and Ludwig et al., 2009). Although PIP and PIP2 were not enriched in the intracellular SGIV (Fig. 3), it was obvious that ORF75R bound specifically to PIP and PIP2, while ORF90L and 101R bound to PI in addition to PIP2. A study on a lipid binding protein ORF-9b from the SARS coronavirus revealed that lipid binding was important for intracellular trafficking of the protein and viral assembly (Meier et al., 2006). This analysis demonstrated that SGIV structural proteins have the capacity to acquire specific lipid species, which may function in intracellular trafficking of the proteins and viral assembly.",

Unexpectedly, we observed that lipid profiles of uninfected GECs changed over time. The molar ratios of PI and ePC increased, while those of Cer, MH, DH and dihydrosphingomyelin (DHSM) decreased from day 1 to day 3. The increase in PI was mainly attributed to PI -36:1, -36:0 and -38:1, whereas the increase in ePC showed a distinct pattern, i.e., all measured saturated and monounsaturated ePC molecules increased, but polyunsaturated species did not. In contrast, the overall abundance of sphingolipids decreased over the 3 days (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Fig. S3). A previous study on human skin fibroblasts has revealed that lipid biosynthesis might be involved in the regulation of cell growth and is dependent on cell density (Vukelic and Kalanj-Bognar, 2001). The changes in the uninfected GEC lipids may be triggered by similar factors, including alterations in cell density, nutrients and medium pH values.",

Our results revealed that the relative amounts of ceramide in infected cells increased from 0.9 to 1.2 and1.5 fold compared to mock infected cells at 1 dpi, 2 dpi and 3 dpi, respectively. This suggests that increased ceramide might be a factor causing apoptosis in SGIV-infected cells. In addition, a closer comparison of lipid profiles of infected and uninfected cells measured at day 1 revealed significant decreases of PE (p\n < 0.01) and MH (p\n < 0.05) as well as a slight decrease of PC (Table 1). Concurrently, SGIV infection significantly increased the molar ratio of ePC (p\n < 0.01) at day 1. Previous studies of the apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells found a decrease of PE and PC and a concomitant increase of ePC (Fuchs et al., 2007.), which is similar to our observation in SGIV-infected GECs.

A visible virus band was collected and washed twice in TNE buffer by centrifugation. The purity of the virus was examined at each step of purification by transmission electron microscopy (EM) (JEOL 100 CXII) after negative staining, as well as by Western blotting using antibodies of anti-actin (Chemicon, MAB1501R) and anti-SGIV structural protein ORF75R. As another negative control for viral purity, a batch of mock-infected cells was subjected to the same procedures of virus purification, lipid extraction and lipid analysis. For mock-infected samples, an equal volume of substances was collected after centrifugation from the same density region where the virus band located in the viral infected sample.",

(b) Pre-treated intracellular viruses with 0.2 mM DDM were incubated with liposome prepared from host cell lipids to rescue viral infectivity. The rescued viruses show a 3-fold higher infectivity than the pre-treated ones. (c) Viruses were treated with phospholipase C (PLC), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and sphingomyelinase (Smase). Viral infectivity is expressed as the percentages of the untreated control. (d) Depletion of viral lipids by various treatments was quantitatively analyzed as described in Materials and methods. The abundance of each lipid group in treated viruses is shown as the percentage of the corresponding lipid group in untreated control, which was set to 100.",
