Materials and methods Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, lowdose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. Results The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT.

To reduce motion artifacts in uncooperative patients (e.g., pediatric patients or patients with dyspnea), fast acquisitions are obtained by lowering the rotation time of the tube-detector system with high pitch and wide collimation values [12] . Conversely, lower radiation doses are achieved at low kV with the implementation of iterative reconstructions for noise reduction [13] . The dualsource CT scanners (DSCT, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) are equipped with two asymmetrical tubedetector systems (i.e., different scan Field of View, FOV), mounted in the gantry with an offset of ~ 90\u00b0. The two tubedetector systems work at different kVp settings for dualenergy acquisitions or at the same kVp setting for ultrafast acquisitions at long pitch (Pitch 1.5-3, Flash or Turbo Flash mode, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen) [14, 15] . Moreover, the X-ray tubes in the second-and third-generation scanners (respectively, the Somatom Flash and Force, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen) have additional tin filtration [16, 17] . In particular, the more aggressive tin filtration in the Somatom Force provides the best spectral separation in dual-energy (DECT) acquisitions by increasing the mean energy of high-kVp spectrum (i.e., 150Sn kVp) [17] . Moreover, the spectral shaping with tin filter (i.e., 100Sn kVp) allows for reduction in the low-energy component of the X-ray spectrum, leading to significant dose reduction [18, 19] .
