Data on hMPV infection in Asia including Sri Lanka is limited. We aimed to detect respiratory viruses including hMPV in a selected group of children affected by a small outbreak of SARI presented to the Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya (THP), Sri Lanka in 2014. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were obtained from 21 children with SARI and tested for hMPV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 (PIV 1-3), adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigens using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). In addition, a one step RT-PCR was done for the detection of hMPV from the viral RNA extracts. Of the 21 NPA samples tested for respiratory viral antigens by IFA, two were positive for RSV (9.5%), one was positive for influenza A (4.8%) and one was positive for both adenovirus and PIV-2 (4.8%). Of the 21 NPA viral RNA extracts tested by RT-PCR, 18 (86%) were positive for hMPV, in which 2 were co-infected with RSV and influenza A virus, respectively. hMPV was the predominant cause of SARI outbreak (2014) in children presented to the THP, Sri Lanka.",

The mortality rate in SARI is high in developing countries compared to developed countries although the morbidity rate remains more or less the same globally [1] . According to the global burden of diseases (GBD) study in 2015, ARTIs including SARI caused 2.74 million deaths in children under 5 years of age [2] . Around 70% of these deaths have been reported from Africa and Southeast Asia [3] . ARTIs in children are commonly caused by viruses such as influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3 (PIV 1-3), adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus (HBoV), enteroviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [4] . Despite the extensive laboratory detection and characterization of these viruses, almost 50% of ARTIs in children remain without an aetiological diagnosis [5] .",

Recruiting children who were critically ill and hospitalized with severe acute respiratory symptoms for the study might have increased the detection of hMPV. As shown by many studies [6, 7, 15, 16] , our findings also shows a male predominance in hMPV infection.",

This agrees with many other studies that indicate co-infection rates within the range of 5 to 17% [5] . Majority of the hMPV co-infections occurs with RSV [7] and this might be due to a mathematical chance for the presence of RSV as it is the number one cause of ARTI in children globally. In the current study, two out of the three co-infections detected were with RSV. Our study did not find a significant difference in terms of disease severity between hMPV co-infections and monoinfections as reported previously [5] . In this study, 2 children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 2 with bronchopneumonia and these findings are in agreement with other studies that symptoms range from mild URTI to severe LRTI [14] . In contrast, our study did not encounter a single case of bronchiolitis. Wheezing has been reported in hMPV infection in children [1, 14] and in our study wheezing was detected in 6 out of the 18 children. Fever, cough, and dyspnoea were common symptoms present in the current study sample with hMPV infection as reported by previous studies [1, 14] . Seven of the 18 children had diarrhoea, although diarrhoea has been indicated in studies before in association with adenovirus infections, its association with hMPV infection has not been reported [7, 8] .",
