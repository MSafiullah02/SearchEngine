In adults, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 appears to be related to immune dysregulation and a resultant cytokine storm (13, 14). Adults with COVID-19 presenting with progressive and/or severe lymphopenia and an increasing neutrophil count have been associated with higher disease severity (13\u201316). In addition, adults who have required ICU care have had higher levels of circulating cytokines associated with the innate immune response (16). Clinical worsening in the adult population has been described to occur in the second week of illness, in keeping with the proposed pro-inflammatory pathophysiology, resulting in progressive lung injury (15). It has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 induces a delayed or suppressed interferon response during the initial phase, resulting in subsequent uncontrolled viral replication and a hyperinflammatory response by the body (13).",

The variation of ACE2 expression and activity with age and its impact on disease is a major knowledge gap in our understanding of pediatric COVID-19.",

Many centers have limited the number of caregivers at the bedside to one caregiver, restricting movement of the caregiver in the hospital, and ensure that staff maintains PPE when at the bedside. Clearly, given the high rates of familial clustering, there is a high likelihood of these family members being similarly infected, and local public health guidance should be followed to ensure minimal risk of nosocomial spread.

The significant psychologic stress that may be experienced by a solo caregiver, coupled with staff time constraints, impaired communication potentially generated by full PPE, and the urgency of multiple sick patients create a perfect storm of challenges.
