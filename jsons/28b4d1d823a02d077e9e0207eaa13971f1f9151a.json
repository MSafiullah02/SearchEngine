            "text": "In industrialized countries, inhalational exposures to various toxicants are commonplace. Most acute toxic inhalations come from industries, home, and recreational sources. In addition to individual susceptibility, the characteristics of inhaled substances such as water solubility, size of substances, and chemical properties may affect disease severity as well as its location. A detailed history becomes even more important in such a patient and may help make a difference in the often chaotic setting of the emergency department. Laboratory evaluation, arterial blood gas analysis, and supportive measures, including the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), may be required. Unfortunately, the varied presentations result in a nonspecific clinical syndrome and make diagnosis somewhat difficult. Despite substantial limitations, imaging can help in showing diffuse interstitial, alveolar, or mixed infiltrates, segmental consolidation, hyperinflation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. Thin-section MDCT can be used to further characterize lung abnormalities and continues to demonstrate previously unidentified characteristics that shape our understanding of noxious inhaled toxicant injury. Introduction Acute obstruction of the central airway is an emergent situation that results from a wide variety of malignant and benign disease processes (Table 1) . Acute management involves establishing a secure and patent route for adequate gas exchange. This requires rapid determination of the location of the obstruction and nature of the obstruction followed by a thoughtful management approach based on findings. Large airway obstruction typically presents with dyspnea and wheeze (particularly during exertion and with forced exhalation maneuver), and it is commonly mistaken for refractory exacerbations of COPD; variable intrathoracic upper airway obstruction is often caused by tracheobronchomalacia, an aspirated object, or central airway tumor. Complete airway obstruction ( Fig. 1) is (e, f) Unenhanced MDCT axial and coronal MIP reconstructions show bilateral complete lung consolidation associated to pleural effusion. Note hypodense material that fills large airways the worst scenario and will result in respiratory failure followed by cardiac arrest in a matter of minutes, a situation that requires an immediate, aggressive response, but it is, fortunately, very uncommon (Fig. 2 ).",

The study is assessed for location of primary tumor/mass, the degree of intrinsic versus extrinsic compression, and the length of the stricture.

Air trapping is usually defined as the percentage of the lung less than 850 HU on expiratory CT, and those individuals with an air-trapping percentage above the median value of 9.66 % defined as having an air-trapping phenotype. Bronchial dilation, or bronchiectasis (defined as a bronchus with a larger diameter than the internal diameter of the adjacent pulmonary artery), is more prevalent in asthmatic patients than in healthy subjects.

Approximately 50 % of patients with HAPE also show symptoms of AMS/HACE, but these two forms of altitude illness can exist independently of each other (Bartsch et al. 2005) . The mechanism remains unclear: HAPE is believed to be a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema without alveolar damage caused by exposure to the low pO2 found at high altitudes. Hypoxia leads to uneven areas of vasoconstriction within the pulmonary vascular bed, resulting in a pattern of patchy overperfusion (Swenson et al. 2002) ; these foci of high vascular pressure lead to localized violation of the capillary endothelium, causing fluid extravasation. When available, CXR features initially are heterogeneous peripheral alveolar patchy, fluffy infiltrates progressing eventually to widespread, confluent airspace involvement more severe in lung bases, but the pattern of distribution is usually unpredictable. Portable lung ultrasonography provides a more feasible imaging option in remote locations and shows progressively larger numbers of extravascular fluid (Fagenholz et al. 2007; Pratali et al. 2010) . The most modifiable risk factor for the development of HAPE is the rate of ascent to high altitude; the mainstay of therapy increases alveolar and arterial oxygen by descent or with supplemental oxygen. HAPE is a potentially life-threatening illness that is completely preventable; as the popularity of trekking and climbing grows among the general population, physicians will be increasingly relied on as a source of education, prophylaxis, and treatment, making a working familiarity with altitudeinduced illnesses such as HAPE an indispensable tool for emergency physicians.",

The onset of pulmonary edema can be delayed by up to 24 h in some cases (Echevarria et al. 2008) . It occurs following approximately 1 % of pneumothorax re-expansions or thoracentesis procedures (mostly if large-volume drainage >3 l). Although the exact mechanism of REPE has not been identified, it appears to be caused by multiple mechanisms. Increased capillary permeability due to hypoxic injury, reperfusion injury with release of toxic oxygen free radicals, and surfactant depletion are all thought to play a major role. Furthermore, a delay in lymphatic return by stasis during prolonged collapse and bronchial occlusion may also partly account for the development of REPE. It can progress for 24-48 h and usually shows slow resolution over 5-7 days. REPE may lead to severe hypoxemia, which will increase lung damage and may result in extensive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. CXR findings are alveolar opacities usually unilateral in those portions of the lung that were previously collapsed; rarely edema can develop in the contralateral lung (Baik et al. 2010) . Thinsection MDCT findings of REPE are peripheral patchy areas of GGO frequently combined with consolidation as well as interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening (Fig. 5) . The British Thoracic Society guidelines suggest that less than 1.5 l of pleural fluid be drained at a time (BTS Pleural Disease Guideline 2010). Drainage catheters can be intermittently plugged to prevent rapid lung re-expansion. Rapid re-expansion of pneumothoraces is less easily controlled and caution should be taken to avoid high negative intrapleural pressures.

One of the commonest mechanisms is resorption of air distal to airway obstruction (e.g., an acutely complicated endobronchial neoplasm or foreign body). Atelectasis can mimic pneumonia, particularly when signs of volume loss, such as crowding of air bronchograms, fissural deviation, mediastinal shift, and diaphragmatic elevation, are absent. Flat, platelike opacities are characteristic of discoid atelectasis. Complete lung collapse, lobar collapse, or segmental collapse can also be seen. The characteristic LUS finding is a homogenous, well-demarcated hyperechoic lung consolidation. In comparison with pneumonia, no air bronchograms are usually visible. The size of the lung consolidation may vary during the breathing cycle due to ventilation. Atelectasis is categorized according to mechanism as obstructive, compressive, cicatricial, and adhesive.",

Opacities may increase in conspicuity over the first 1-2 days in aspiration pneumonitis, but should resolve relatively rapidly thereafter. If opacities persist or increase over several days, aspiration pneumonia is likely present.

The most frequently aspirated foreign bodies are food (especially nuts), teeth, dental devices, and medical instruments, and 70 % will be nonopaque on conventional radiography (Fig. 7) . Some nuts, such as peanuts, have an oil that leads to inflammation and edema making them more difficult to expel. When a foreign body enters the lung parenchyma, prolonged irritation with intermittent infections may cause massive hemoptysis. At radiology, an aspirated foreign body may cause one lung or lobar/segmental overinflation or atelectasis (obstructive emphysema) with chronic volume loss in the affected lobe, mediastinal shift, pneumomediastinum, recurrent pneumonias, and bronchiectasis; it can occasionally mimic a congenital malformation or neoplasm (Fig. 8) .",

Deaths because of drowning have estimated approximately 305,000 deaths in 2008 (WHO 2011). Young children are at particularly high risk of drowning, and males in general face a significantly greater risk than females. Drowning may be further classified as cold-water (<20 \u00b0C) or warm-water injury (>20 \u00b0C). The most important contributory factors to morbidity and mortality from drowning are hypoxemia and acidosis and the multiorgan effects of these processes. Central nervous system (CNS) damage may occur because of hypoxemia sustained during the drowning episode (primary injury) or may result from arrhythmias, ongoing pulmonary injury, reperfusion injury, or multiorgan dysfunction (secondary injury), particularly with prolonged tissue hypoxia. After initial breath holding, when the victim's airway lies below the liquid's surface, an involuntary period of laryngospasm is triggered by the presence of liquid in the oropharynx or larynx (stage 1, \"dry drowning\"). At this time, the victim is unable to breathe in air, causing oxygen depletion and carbon dioxide retention. In stage 2, the victim still usually presents with laryngospasm but may begin to swallow water into the stomach. As the oxygen tension in blood drops further, laryngospasm releases, and oblique axial and (f) coronal MIP reconstructions show a lipid-density oval endobronchial mass. At bronchoscopy foreign body aspiration diagnosis was confirmed and a vegetable lipid matter was removed the victim gasps and hyperventilates, possibly aspirating variable amounts of liquid. This leads to further hypoxemia (stage 3). Ultimately, if the process of drowning is not interrupted, hypoxia progresses to the point of complete circulatory collapse and cardiac arrest (Tourigny and Hall 2012) . Pulmonary infections may occur in a delayed fashion from aspirated material, some of which may result from rare or atypical pathogens such as fungi. Patients in cardiac arrest are more likely to display a nonshockable cardiac rhythm (i.e., asystole or pulseless electrical activity).",

The clinical significance of near drowning depends more on the volume of water aspirated than on whether the aspirate is freshwater or saltwater. Classic CXR findings in severe near drowning consist of alveolar edema with extensive \"fluffy\" areas of increased opacity that tend to coalesce throughout both lungs ( Fig. 10 ). In mild near drowning, findings range from normal to confluent irregular peripheral areas of increased opacity in a subsegmental or segmental distribution with peripheral sparing.

Acid liquid introduced into the airways is rapidly disseminated throughout the bronchial tree and lung parenchyma, producing a chemical pneumonitis within minutes. The magnitude of injury is directly related to the pH and volume of the aspirated material. The overall mortality rate associated with massive aspiration of gastric acid is approximately 30 % and is greater than 50 % in patients with initial shock or apnea, secondary pneumonia, or adult respiratory distress syndrome (Bynum and Pierce 1976) . Classic CXR findings in acute gastric acid aspiration include bilateral perihilar, ill-defined, alveolar consolidations, multifocal patchy infiltrates, and segmental or lobar consolidation, which are usually localized to one or both lung bases (Fig. 6a ).",

Clinically, acute lipoid pneumonia presents most often with cough, dyspnea, and fever. CXR pictures show consolidation, reticular and mixed alveolar-interstitial changes, as well as nodular lesions. Other rarer abnormalities, which may be noted on radiograms, are pneumatocele, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pleural effusion (Franquet et al. 2000) . Most commonly, CT shows areas of a negative attenuation coefficient (between \u2212150 and \u221230 HU) consolidation and ground-glass opacities as well as interstitial changes such as interlobular septal thickening and intralobular lines; fine, poorly demarcated centrilobular nodules and nodular lesions; pneumatocele; pneumothorax; pneumomediastinum; and pleural effusion (Brander et al. 1992; Laurent et al. 1999 ).

First described by Laennec in 1819, later detailed by Sir William Osler in the late 1800s, and further defined by Reid in the 1950s, this condition is generally defined as an abnormal and permanent focal or diffuse dilatation of the cartilage-containing airways (bronchi) caused by weakening or destruction of the muscular and elastic components of the bronchial walls (Hansell et al. 2008) . Care must be taken to distinguish this large airway dilatation from dilatation of the small airways (bronchioles) that do not contain cartilage (Javidan-Nejad and Bhalla 2010). In contrast to established bronchiectasis actor performing in fire blowing shows who has aspirated liquid kindling for the grill 2 days before the onset of symptoms and was admitted acutely to the emergency department due to 38.8 \u00b0C fever, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. (a, b) Axial MDCT scans show a low-density consolidation in the middle lung lobe and scattered groundglass opacities. (c) MDCT coronal MIP reconstruction better shows the low-density middle lobe consolidation. Region-of-interest measurements showed -60 to -80 Hounsfield units (HU), consistent with fat occurring in adults, some children with bronchiectasis have been shown to have resolution or considerable improvement of the changes seen on CT scanning, suggesting the possibility that the condition may be reversible in some cases (Al Subie and Fitzgerald 2010). Bronchiectasis results from the occurrence of one of the three main pathogenic mechanisms: bronchial wall injury, bronchial lumen obstruction, and traction from adjacent fibrosis (Shoemark et al. 2007 ). The latter two mechanisms are usually apparent on imaging and are suggested by an endobronchial filling defect or adjacent interstitial lung disease, while when it is met the first mechanism the radiologist is faced with a more difficult differential diagnosis (Javidan-Nejad and Bhalla 2009). The dominant feature of bronchiectasis is clearly the presence of airway inflammation, in association with bacterial infection and, in particular, nonclearing infection. An initial airway insult, such as an infection, often on the background of genetic susceptibility, compromised host clearance mechanisms and, in particular, the mucociliary escalator mechanism, which facilitated persistent bacterial colonization and infection. This damages the airway further, both directly and indirectly, as a consequence of the initiation of a secondary host inflammatory response. The three pathogenic elements in bronchiectasis-namely, airway infection, inflammation, and enzymatic activities-interact to result in progressive airway damage. Many patients eventually harbor Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in their airway, which is associated with significant morbidity (Pappalettera et al. 2009 ).",

Impaired clearance of secretions causes colonization and infection with pathogenic organisms, contributing to the purulent expectoration commonly observed in patients with acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis. The result is further bronchial damage and a vicious cycle of bronchial damage, bronchial dilation, impaired clearance of secretions, recurrent infection, and more bronchial damage (Cole 1984) . P. aeruginosa often causes chronic bronchial infection in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis via a mechanism involving biofilm formation and the release of virulence factors. This suggests that Pseudomonas species may promote disease progression and that infection with these species may be related to worsening lung function and increased morbidity and mortality (Davies et al. 2006) . Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are prone to prolonged exacerbations. Although hemoptysis is common dur-ing infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis, it may also occur in the absence of concurrent infection, so-called dry bronchiectasis, which is usually a sequela of tuberculosis and is found in the upper lobes. Hemoptysis, sometimes lifethreatening, is caused by chronic airway inflammation and hypoxemia, which leads to bronchial arterial neovascularization (Bruzzi et al. 2006 ). Finally, acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis are associated with increased mortality, and the majority of deaths are related to respiratory infection, with higher mortality rates associated with increasing age and number of lobes affected.",

(b) When seen end on, bronchiectatic airways appear as ill-defined ring shadows, ranging in size from 5 to 20 mm, notably in the mid and upper zones where the majority of airways run parallel to the radiograph beam. Signs of complications/exacerbations, such as dilated bronchi filled with pus and mucus, result in tubular and ovoid opacities and sometimes in the dramatic appearance of a gloved finger, typically seen in patients with mucoid impaction of the airways due to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (Fig. 14) (Martinez et al. 2008 ). (c) In severe cystic disease, multiple thin-walled ring shadows that may contain fluid levels are present; the signet ring sign corresponds to a dilated bronchus immediately adjacent to a smaller companion pulmonary artery (Hansell 1998 ). (d) Because the bronchi lie alongside the pulmonary arteries, peribronchial inflammation in early bronchiectasis makes the margins of vessels indistinct, particularly in the lower lobes (Hansell 1998) . (e) Associated volume loss in the lower lobes may cause obscuration of the underlying hemidiaphragm and crowding of pulmonary vascular markings, usually caused by mucous obstruction of the peripheral bronchi (Westcott 1991 ). (f) Additional features of focal areas of subsegmental collapse and patchy peribronchial consolidation are nonspecific but are common in generalized disease.

The detail afforded by 1-mm images of the peripheral airways has proved superior to virtually every other method for assessing the extent and severity of disease. Furthermore, thin-section CT features may be suggestive of certain underlying conditions but require correlation with clinical and laboratory assessments, and images should be examined for findings suggesting ABPA, cystic fibrosis, immotile cilia, opportunist mycobacteria, and tracheobronchomegaly ( Fig. 15 ) (Milliron et al. 2015) .",

Using MDCT as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of incremental HRCT in detecting bronchiectasis were 71 %, 93 %, 88 %, and 81 %, respectively (Hill et al. 2010; Dodd et al. 2006 ). Interobserver agreement for the presence, extent, and severity of bronchiectasis was also better for MDCT (kappa 0.64, 0.5, and 0.48, respectively) than for incremental HRCT (kappa 0.65, 046, and 0.25, respectively) (Dodd et al. 2006) . Because today most patients present with relatively mild bronchiectasis, with few (if any) physical signs, the diagnosis is usually made by a combination of the patient's history and a thinslice MDCT examination. It is important to include expiratory imaging as part of the routine MDCT acquisition (Bankier et al. 1996) . If it is possible, continuous acquisition of images during a forced or slow expiratory maneuver (dynamic expiratory CT) is not only more sensitive for detection of air trapping but also leads to identification of air trapping in normal individuals (Gotway et al. 2000) . MinIP reconstructions are useful to demonstrate winding, interconnected tubular structures. Serious limitations for the use of quantitative airway measurements, most often including lumen diameter, bronchoarterial ratio (BAR), lumen area (LA) and volume, wall thickness/diameter ratio (T/D ratio), and wall area percent (WA%), have been repeatedly documented, and none of these have proved of value in everyday routine clinical practice (Brillet et al. 2009; Williamson et al. 2009 ). As a consequence of these limitations, visual inspection remains the standard for clinical assessment of airway disorders; the potential for new methods for obtaining clinically useful automated quantitative airway evaluation remains to be evaluated. The extent of involvement of the lungs documented on HRCT scanning has been shown to correlate with both functional changes (PFT) and clinical outcomes, and HRCT score correlates significantly with exacerbation frequency (Brody et al. 2005) . Although volumetric CT has numerous advantages, the radiation dose is higher and can be mitigated by several techniques (McCollough et al. 2009 ). Because of concerns of the level of radiation exposure with CT, particularly in children, MRI has been (e) ABPA bronchiectasis: ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens, affecting mostly patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis; bronchiectasis, mainly centric and in the upper lobes, is the hallmark of the disease. In ABPA retained secretions may appear sufficiently dense to mimic calcification or may calcificate studied more recently for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis and been found to be a potentially suitable radiation-free alternative to CT, although the poorer spatial resolution of MRI limits the ability to visualize smaller airways and nodules (Montella et al. 2009 ). The most specific thinslice CT scanning direct findings suggestive of bronchiectasis are (Table 8 ) (Naidich et al. 1982; Grenier et al. 1986; Hansell 1998; Javidan-Nejad and Bhalla 2009; King and Daviskas 2010; Bonavita and Naidich 2012) (Fig. 16 ):",

Plugging of the smaller peripheral airways and peribronchiolar inflammation are characterized by a tree-in-bud appearance, with V-and Y-shaped branching nodular opacities (Fig. 17) .",

Mosaic attenuation is a term used to denote heterogeneous lung density, often exhibiting a distinctly geographic distribution. This nonspecific finding typically results from one of the following three causes: (1) foci of abnormally increased lung density caused by a variety of infiltrative and/or airspace filling diseases; (2) alternating lowdensity and high-density foci reflecting variations (Bonavita and Naidich 2012) . Differentiation between these causes is best accomplished on images acquired in deep expiration. Air trapping results either from mucous plugging and abnor-mal bronchial compliance or inflammation/fibrosis of the small airways, reflecting a combination of both large and small airway obstruction. Another ancillary finding is the presence of dilated bronchial arteries in patients with longstanding severe bronchiectasis. This finding is easily identified following administration of intravenous contrast as irregular, tortuous vessels arising from the proximal descending thoracic aorta extending along the central airways toward the pulmonary hila. Identification of hypertrophied bronchial arteries may explain hemoptysis that is otherwise unaccounted for in select acute exacerbation cases (Fig. 18) .",

The severity pattern of disease is a function of the toxin or mix of toxins (particle size, density, water solubility, shape) that constituted the exposure, duration of exposure, minute ventilation, and the host factor status of the individual. The total inhaled dose is equal to agent concentration multiplied by time of exposure and minute ventilation (Rabinowitz and Siegel 2002; Borron and Bebarta 2015; Nelson and Hoffman 2006; McKay 2014; Salem and Katz 2015) . The effects of inhalation exposure to toxicants can be thought of as follows: simple asphyxiants, tissue asphyxiants, nonrespiratory systemic toxicants with pulmonary absorption, and direct airway cellular injury. Such injuries in general occur either through localized pulmonary damage or by systemic absorption after inhalation (Miller and Chang 2003) .",

Gases that are highly water-soluble, such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride, generally cause acute irritant injury to mucus membranes, including the eyes and the lining of the nose and upper airway, and spare the lower respiratory tract. This irritant injury causes unpleasant symptoms that often encourage an individual to rapidly leave an area of exposure; this prevents more severe clinical effects. Less soluble gases, such as phosgene, ozone, and nitrogen oxides, often cause no symptoms or ill effects in the upper airway. They penetrate into the lower airway and cause irritant effects in the bronchi, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli. Pulmonary irritants with intermediate solubility can produce a mixed clinical picture; whether upper or lower tract symptoms predominate depends on the duration and intensity of the exposure. Chlorine gas is a prototypical example of an intermediate solubility irritant and can produce a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes depending on the circumstances surrounding a given exposure (Rabinowitz and Siegel 2002) . There is a gradual but progressive airway response to direct cellular injury. Within a few hours of postexposure, there is extensive but mild mucosal edema, no ulceration, and deceptively minimal clinical symptoms. Over the next 8-48 h, there is progressive airway edema, mucopurulent membrane production, and bronchorrhea. Within 48-72 h, there is mucosal slough and evolution of a membranous tracheobronchitis. If toxic agents pass to the level of the conducting airways, damage to the epithelial cells and tight junctions can increase mucosal permeability to other substances, which increases inflammation and cellular damage. This can lead to bronchoconstriction, peribronchial edema, and bronchial mucosal slough and all can contribute to the development of atelectasis. Substances that have lower water solubility and particles less than 5 \u03bcm in diameter can penetrate into the lower respiratory tract. In the distal airways and alveoli, epithelial and endothelial injury results in permeability-induced edema. This can manifest anywhere from mild interstitial edema to pulmonary insufficiency. As in other forms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), this results in decreased lung compliance, increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (Ferguson et al. 2012; Fanelli et al. 2013) . Pulmonary edema may be immediate in pulmonary high-concentration toxicant exposure or may be delayed 24-48 h postexposure (Miller and Chang 2003) . Aggressive supportive care is often lifesaving, and treatment is usually symptomatic with the exception of organophosphates, certain chemical asphyxiants, such as cyanide and carbon monoxide, and opioid poisonings and toxicant-induced methemoglobinemia (Endorf and Gamelli 2007; Micak et al. 2007; Heitkamp et al. 2012) . Airway injury is present in up to one-third of patients with major burns. Pulmonary insufficiency is a major cause of death in burn victims from residential or commercial structure fires and has been shown to result from inhalation of toxic products of combustion including the oxides of sulfur, nitrogen, aldehyde gases, and particulates, rather than from thermal injury. Carbon monoxide is rapidly transported across the alveolar membrane and binds to hemoglobin. Smoke inhalation also adds to mortality from cutaneous thermal burns and represents a combination of direct pulmonary injury and systemic and metabolic toxicities (mortality rates are approximately 5-8 %) (Table 11 ) (Darling et al. 1996) .

A normal CXR, usually obtained in decubitus AP view at the often unstable patient's bedside at ED admission, may be valuable as a baseline for subsequent CXR or follow-up and does not exclude parenchymal or airway injury which may only be evident 24-48 h after the acute event (ARDS latent period), despite clinical evidence of lung injury (arterial hypoxemia, elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels) (Wittram and Kenny 1994 ). An abnormal CXR on admission is variable in severity and extent, indicates a worse prognosis, and may show various disease patterns: (a) Subglottic edema with a conical narrowing of the airway, tracheal narrowing, diffuse peribronchial infiltration, moderate venous congestion, peripherally located small round clear bubbles closely arranged to each other in a shape resembling a mulberry, and focal or diffuse patchy opacities that usually (if not complicated by ARDS) evolve over the first few days or clear within 4-6 days, most likely due to atelectasis and consolidations (Fig. 19) . Causes of atelectasis include decreased mucociliary clearance, inspissated secretions of the bronchi and bronchioles, reflex bronchoconstriction, and surfactant inactivation. (b) Bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities more likely represent progressive noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, by increased permeability diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with resultant transudation into the alveolar spaces (ARDS), leading to hypoxemia that is refractory to usual oxygen therapy (Ferguson et al. 2012 ). This can manifest anywhere from mild interstitial edema to pulmonary insufficiency (Fig. 20) . ARDS is the final pathway of acute lung injury caused by a variety of agents, including inhaled toxins, aspiration, and infection (George et al. 2003) . CXR may help in differentiating it from typical pulmonary edema: CXR features usually develop 12-24 h after initial lung insult, and within 1 week, alveolar pulmonary edema (hyaline membrane) occurs due to type 1 pneumocyte damage. In contrast to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which clears in response to diuretic therapy, ARDS persists for days to weeks. In addition, as the initial radiographic findings of ARDS clear, the underlying lung appears to have a reticular pattern secondary to type 2 pneumocyte proliferation and fibrosis.",

A high RADS score (>8 per slice) in addition to a positive bronchoscopy (high AIS score) was associated with a high probability (12.7-fold increase) of pneumonia, Fig. 21 Integrated imaging (CXR, US, MDCT) in a 43-year-old man working in a chemical industry who was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of shortness of breath and hemoptysis, which began 3 h after accidental inhalation of nitric acid fumes from falling over the unlocked nitric acid container. He was urgently intubated for respiratory failure approximately 5 h after exposure, and copious serosanguinous secretion was aspirated from endotracheal tube. (a) CXR on admission shows bilateral ground-glass opacities. (b) Complementary LUS sagittal scan on the lateral chest at the seventh intercostal space shows focal consolidation in the lower left lobe. MDCT (c, d) axial scans show GGO patchy areas in the upper lobes and widespread GGO with early consolidations in both lower lobes and pleural effusion. Nitric acid is commonly used in various industries and its accidental spillage generates oxides of nitrogen, including nitrogen dioxide, a potent lung toxin when inhaled acute lung injury/ARDS, and death, thus showing the potential for chest CT to complement bronchoscopy in detecting clinically significant inhalation injury (Oh et al. 2012) . Yamamura et al. used CT imaging to demonstrate the significant association between bronchial wall thickness (BWT) on admission and development of pneumonia; BWT, measured 2 cm distal from the tracheal bifurcation at three time points (at admission, 24 h after, and 7 days after admission), may be a predictor of the severity of SII (Yamamura et al. 2013) (Fig. 22) . While the BWT of the normal volunteers is <2 mm, on admission BWT cutoff value of >3.0 mm can predict the total number of ventilator days, ICU stay days, and pneumonia development with a sensitivity of 79 %, specificity of 96 %, positive predictive value of 91 %, and a negative predictive value of 88 % (Yamamura et al. 2013) .",

Atypical ARDS, characterized by predominantly anterior consolidations in supine decubitus, can be observed in 5 % of patients during the first stage of the disease, probably due to regional differences in ventilation.

(2013) in a case of smoke inhalation injury (SII). The double headed arrows indicate the measurement of bronchial wall thickness (BWT) was 3.2 mm on admission (a), 4.2 mm after 6 days (b), and 2.8 mm after 10 days (c). This patient had associated pneumonia and remained in the ICU for 13 days pulmonary complications in the hospitalized patient (e.g., in burn victims, ranges are from 15 to 42 %), including infection, septicemia, ARDS, barotraumas (usually from intubation and positive pressure ventilation), multiorgan failure (MOF), and fluid overload (George et al. 2003) . In severely burned patients in ICU, it may be difficult to discriminate among these various components on CXR. The most challenging differential diagnosis is still between ARDS and cardiogenic edema. Because these lung complications are associated with a significant increase in mortality, ranging from 50 to 89 %, diagnosis of pulmonary injury is important for both therapeutic and prognostic considerations and must be performed, if it is possible, by thin-slice MDCT. Early signs of barovolutrauma often correspond to interstitial emphysema and subpleural cystic airspaces. Subsequently, imaging studies can demonstrate the development of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax (often hypertensive in mechanically ventilated patients), and subcutaneous emphysema (Gattinoni et al. 2006) (Fig. 23 ).",

The extent of CT opacities (>80 % of lung volume), along with the presence of bronchiectasis, honeycombing, and signs of pulmonary hypertension (dilatation of pulmonary arteries and right ventricle), indicates early fibrosis and predicts mortality (Ichikado et al. 2006 ). In the later or fibrotic ARDS stage, MDCT generally demonstrates persistent ground-glass densities and reticulations, air cysts, and bullae, mainly located in the ventral regions of the lung, more often than CXR (Masclans et al. 2011) . Late exposure complications such as occupational asthma, reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS), increased airway responsiveness, and decreased residual volume have been described. Chronic effects of lower respiratory tract injury include bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and pulmonary fibrosis. Bronchiolitis obliterans produces a pattern of fixed airway obstruction that may develop several weeks after injury, following a period in which symptoms improve. Granulation tissue plugs develop within small airways and alveolar ducts, accompanied by small airway destruction with obliterative fibrous scarring.",

            "text": "\"Smoke inhalation\" is a generic term that refers to a potential exposure to a wide variety of substances because of the complex chemistry of heat decomposition and pyrolysis (Glazer 2003; Miller and Chang 2003) . Thermal airway injury is generally limited to supraglottic structures, whereas injury to the lower airway is chemical in nature. Smoke inhalation injury (SII) complicates burns in approximately 10-20 % of patients and is a major cause of mortality in burn patients because it can trigger pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and problems with fluid balance (El-Helbawi and Ghareeb 2011; You et al. 2014) . Victims of fire accidents may be divided into three categories: those suffering only cutaneous injury, those with cutaneous and inhalational injury, and those with inhalational injury alone (Dries and Endorf 2013) . Cutaneous burns are assessed in percent of total body surface area (TBSA) affected by the burn and by evaluating the burn depth. The soot present on the face, in the nose, or in the mouth of a fire victim must raise the suspicion of the inhalation injury. The injury may be limited to the upper airways and manifested by nasopharyngeal irritation, hoarseness, stridor, and dry cough or may extend deeper causing tracheobronchial and alveolar destruction with the symptoms of dyspnea, chest discomfort, bronchial breath sounds, wheezing, rales, cyanosis, and carbonaceous sputum. An abnormal CXR in the first 48 h was stated to be a poor prognostic indicator (Wittram and Kenny 1994; Miller and Chang 2003) . The noxious products of combustion induce a laryngotracheobronchitis that may be severe enough to be hemorrhagic, ulcerative, or necrotizing. Surfactant and the surfactant-producing type II pneumocytes may be destroyed or damaged, leading to a DAD, loss of lung compliance, and the damaged vascular endothelium leading to an increased microvascular permeability with resultant edema (Fig. 24) .",

Although it can induce oxygen radical formation in all tissues, a structural homology results in its active uptake by pneumocytes from the circulation. The high concentration of polyamine transporters on the luminal side of the type I and type II pneumocytes and club (formerly Clara) cells results in as much as a tenfold concentration of PQ in the pneumocytes (Zhang et al. 2013) . Should patients survive the initial caustic ingestion, progressive pulmonary fibrosis with death occurring up to a month later can be expected. In the shortly exposed survivor group, thin-section CT may show ground-glass opacities, consolidations, pleural effusion, and early fibrosis findings (Im et al. 1991; Lee et al. 1995; Kim et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2013 ).",

With high-intensity silica acute inhalation, as might be rarely seen in sandblasting or mining, a proliferation of type II pneumocytes can occur, with alveolar proteinosis from excessive surfactant production. This condition is known as acute silicosis also called silicoproteinosis (Dee et al. 1978; Marchiori et al. 2007 ). Thin-section CT scans show a diffuse GGO (ground-glass opacity) or alveolar pattern with septal thickening, similar to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Buechner and Ansari 1969) (Fig. 25 ).",
