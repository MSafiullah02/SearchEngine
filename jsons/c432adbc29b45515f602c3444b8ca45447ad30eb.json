We address how to overcome current challenges and drive the field forward, not only approaching a detection of the 21-cm signal but to a full characterisation of its parameter space, in particular, probing an increasingly larger volume of k-modes (spatially and in redshifts). We also will shortly touch upon the kinds of questions that could drive such future endeavours.",

Both theoretically and observationally great progress has been made, although a convincing detection of the 21-cm signal still has to be achieved both for the globally-averaged 21-cm signal as well as its spatial fluctuations. We have observed the construction and operation of a vast number of ground-based interferometers and single-element receivers, covering a wide range in terms of collecting area, core filling factor, field of view, frequency coverage, observational strategies (e.g. drift scan versus tracking) and receiver technology (phased-array versus dishes). Besides these instrument and technology developments driving the field forward, an enormous effort has been undertaken to develop much more refined flagging, calibration, imaging, foreground-removal, and 21-cm signal extraction methodologies (e.g., [28] ). These two tracks (instrument and signal processing) have gone hand in hand and have led to a steady progression and ever more stringent 21-signal limits (e.g., [42] ). The first confirmed 21-cm signal detection could be well in reach in the coming years.",

Although confirmation of this claim is still needed, it shows that astrophysical effects (e.g. bright polarised foregrounds, ionospheric refraction, RFI mitigation) and instrumental challenges (e.g. chromatic leakage, band-pass structure, multi-path propagation, etc.) are controllable over nearly six orders of magnitude, and further improvements are still coming. These improvements in both instrument design, layout and interferometer versus single receiver technology, also inform each other and hybrid systems that are currently under construction (e.g. LEDA, NenuFAR). Besides these ongoing experiments and observational programs, the next generation of instruments, of which HERA and the SKA (Section 9.2.2 and 9.2.1) are the most significant proponents, is now underway. Whereas currently instruments are limited to a \"statistical detection\" of the 21-cm signal power spectra (opposed to the direct detection of the global signal; [30] ), mostly limited to the EoR due to the increasingly bright foregrounds and stronger ionospheric errors when moving to lower frequencies, these next-generation instruments aim not only to measure the 21-cm signal statistically but image it directly to the mK-level during the EoR and expand the redshift range to the Cosmic Dawn. This level of sensitivity requires a substantial increase in collecting area and filling factor (by a factor of about ten) over current instruments, thus stepping away for the experimental stage in which many active instruments find themselves. These new or upgraded systems are incorporating many of the lessons learned from past and ongoing efforts.",

For direct imaging of the 21-cm signal or fluctuations on small scales, the field of view (FoV) is less critical since cosmic variance might not be the driving factor. A limited FoV will increase the sample variance on the large scales, however, in power-spectrum measurements. Besides the sensitivity to a given 21-cm signal mode in the presence of thermal noise, there are many other instrumental limitations. Some of these limitations can be kept under control to some extent but some cannot, and thus have to be avoided (e.g., by choosing the proper location or controllable experimental setup) or mitigated (i.e., correct for errors in the data in real-time or during post-processing).

These bands are generally limited in their spectral resolution, some channels are lost to RFI (e.g. FM band, DAB/DVB; see below) and in some cases not even covered (e.g. below the ionospheric cutoff which limits observations of the Dark Ages).

This increasing RFI occupancy motivates the next generation of instruments to be built in remote desert environments such as the Karroo in South Africa and Western Australia. Going to space is another, albeit expensive option. Just above the Earth, however, any receiver would see a much larger number of transmitters, making the problem worse. Even at a distance of the moon, an RFI suppression of eight orders of magnitude in power would be needed to mitigate it to a level that the 21-cm signal from the CD can be observed. In a lunar orbit, the moon would shield the receivers from Earth and also from solar radiation for a fraction of the time, creating an \"RFI-free\" cone. A receiver on the fare-side of the moon itself might be shielded even more.

SKA-low aims to have 512 stations in Phase 1 (denoted here by SKA1-low), having 256 log-periodic cross-dipole receivers that cover the full frequency band and are semi-randomly spread inside a 40 m diameter circle. The requirement of a high-gain receiver over the full spectral band limits the field of view to a cone with an opening angle of about 90 degrees centred on the zenith, but one that maximizes forward gain. The current receiver design also aims for a spectrally smooth bandpass, something rather difficult to realize for a wide-field and wide-band receiver (refs). About 212 stations will be placed inside a central core of about 600 m (Figure 9 .1), making it about eight times more sensitive than LOFAR. The remaining stations will be distributed along three arms that \"spiral\" outward up to about 65 km, in the current design. The long baselines will enable proper direction-dependent gain calibration of the system. The SKA observational and calibration strategy leverages on minimal redundancy to reduce the point spread function side-lobes, improve imaging fidelity and sky-based calibration capabilities. : 320 dishes are located in the hexagonal core and 30 more outrigger dishes are planned to be deployed out to a maximum baselines of \u223c 800 m to improve angular resolution and imaging capabilities. The core is split in three sectors that are displaced from each other by a fraction of the dish diameter (see [15] for a detailed discussion. The split core provides a significantly improved instantaneous uv coverage (central panel) whilst retaining high redundancy. The right panel shows the expected relative antenna gain errors after using redundant calibration (from [15] ).",

Observations of individual ionized structures will enable crosscorrelations with many other instruments that aim to look for the sources of reionization (e.g., JWST, ALMA, SPICA). Figure 9 .2 shows an example of how well SKA-low will constrain reionization parameters ( [22] ). Currently, SKA is planned to be operational around 2028, although early science is foreseen several years before that. Finally, ideas for a far-future ( 2030) upgrade to SKA2-low have already been developed (e.g., [25] ), which nominally foresees an increase in collecting area by a factor of about four. This could allow more detailed imaging due to lower thermal noise, and increase angular resolution also at higher redshifts.",

Given the high redundant configuration, imaging tomography will remain challenging for HERA and likely the goal of a future generation experiment. As foreground modeling and characterization will also be limited because of redundancy and the coarse angular resolution, a significant effort was dedicated to keep the instrumental response from corrupting the intrinsically smooth foreground spectra and to accurately model it ( [34] , [18] , [49] , [38] ). An alternative approach to redundant calibration is to apply foreground avoidance using closure phase quantities from antenna triads ( [48] ): closure phase are insensitive to errors in direction independent interferometric calibration and, therefore, directly bypass the requirement of an accurate spectral calibration (see Chapter 5 in this book for an overview of calibration of 21 cm observations). A preliminary analysis of HERA closure phases seem to confirm these premises ( [10] ). HERA is currently under construction, with more than 200 dishes deployed, and 21 cm observations are currently being analyzed. New feeds that extend the sensitivity to the 50-250 MHz range are currently deployed for testing in order to enable observations in the 12 < z < 35 range (the Cosmic Dawn) and probe the nature of the first luminous sources and their impact on the thermal history of the intergalacic medium.",

Five additional outrigger dipoles are custom-equipped to measure the global 21 cm signal via individual custom-built dipoles (see Section 9.3.2). The very dense core provides exceptional brightness sensitivity and a point spread function with very low sidelobes. The outrigger dipoles improve the angular resolution that helps to identify calibration sources and lower the confusion level. As the dipoles are individually correlated, visibilities have contributions from all-sky emission, particularly from Galactic diffuse emission -given the number of short baselines -and with significant ionospheric-induced refraction and scintillation. Despite these challenges, [16] generated the first high quality all-sky foreground maps. The LEDA approach to measure the 21 cm signal can be versatile, allowing to image and subtract foregrounds ( [16] ) but also to avoid them (similar to [3] ). [17] analyzed 20 hours of LEDA data calibrated using a compact source sky model and filtering foregrounds by using their statistical properties in way similar to [14] and [51] . They reported an initial 10 8 mK 2 upper limit on the 21 cm power spectrum at z = 18.4. Several hundreds of hours of observations have been collected now and will be the focus of future analysis towards the detection of the power spectrum from the Cosmic Dawn and an independent confirmation of the reported detection by [7] . This is due to the limited effective Low-Band Antenna (LBA) collecting area, and the system temperature at low frequencies being much larger. Furthermore, the LBA dipoles are rather narrow-band, and the gains sharply peak around 60 MHz, dropping rapidly at frequencies away from the resonance. LOFAR will undergo upgrade in the coming years in order to improve its sensitivity and capability to calibrate the ionospheric distortions. Sensitivity will be increased by connecting the 48 dipoles in each LBA station that are not connected to the acquisition system because of budget limitations.",

This operational mode increases the field of view by a factor of about 25 for the HBA system and to all-sky for the LBA system (Figure 9 .6), improving the power-spectrum sensitivity by a factor of about five or more per unity bandwidth (since both the collecting area and filling factor remain similar and long baselines do not add sensitivity to the 21-cm signal). AARTFAAC is currently already being used to target, for example, the 21-cm signal in the Cosmic Dawn with the goal to interferometrically confirm the recently reported global signal detection ([7]).

It recently underwent an expansion (termed \"phase II\", [56] ) where the number of stations was doubled: 72 new stations were placed in two highly redundant hexagons next to the array centre and 56 stations outside the phase I array to extend the maximum baseline up \u223c 5 km. Only 128 stations can still be instantaneously correlated, resulting in two different configurations: a compact configuration that includes the two redundant hexagons and the phase I compact core, and an extended configuration that excludes the two redundant hexagons and includes stations out to the longest baselines (see Chapter 8 in this book for an illustration of both configurations).",

The field of view of NenuFAR is about 20 degrees at 60 MHz, and, inside the 400 m core, the filling factor reaches order unity at 35 MHz, and \u223c 0.25 at 60 MHz, which makes it extremely sensitive to low-surface brightness structures.

The EDGES experiment has been pioneering techniques to accurately model all the various instrumental components in order to carefully control systematics effects ( [6] , [32] ). Observations in the high band have constrained the duration of reionization \u2206z to be longer than \u2206z > 1 and started to constrain some properties of the first galaxies ( [33] , [31] ). In the low band, [7] reported the surprising detection of an absorption trough twice deeper than the most extreme models, posing a serious challenge to its interpretation -assuming it is of cosmological origin. In the light of this anomalous signal, the EDGES team is deploying a new dipole antenna tuned in size to simultaneously observe the 60 \u2212 160 MHz range (i.e. \u223c 25% smaller than the low band antenna) and confirm the results in the low band.

A series of upgrades have been implemented since the early system: filters with a sharper roll-off were installed in order to improve RFI rejection and extend the observing band up to 87.5 MHz; the noise diode stability was improved and a system to measure the ambient temperature was installed on the dipoles. The receiver seems to show the necessary stability to measure the global signal, however, other sources of systematic effects related to the antenna gain pattern remain less well known and are the subject of ongoing modeling and investigation.

The SARAS antennas have been designed to provide nearly frequency independent beams and avoid coupling of sky spatial structures into spectral structures in order to preserve the intrinsically smooth foreground spectrum ( [43] ).

The array would consist of 128 dual polarization antennas deployed across a 10 km area by a rover, observing in the 0.1 \u2212 100 MHz (basically z > 13) range. FARSIDE would also include precision calibration of an individual antenna element via an orbiting beacon in order to attempt the detection of the global 21 cm from the Dark Ages (50 < z < 100). A NASA-funded design study, focused on the instrument, a deployment rover, the lander and base station, delivered an architecture broadly consistent with the requirements for a Probe mission (about 1.3 billion USD).",

NCLE is designed, built and tested by a Dutch consortium comprised of the Radboud University, ASTRON and ISIS, in close collaboration with the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is composed of three, 5 m-long, carbon-fibre monopole antenna units that can be switched into dipole mode to observe in the 0.08 \u2212 80 MHz range. Its main target is therefore the global 21 cm signal from the Darks Ages and the Cosmic Dawn although it will also provide accurate, degree-scale foreground maps below 10 MHz and an extensive characterization of the radio frequency interference environment in the lunar far side. The Queqiao satellite was launched on May 21st, 2018, and is currently behind the Moon, in the Earth-Moon second Lagrange point. NCLE is currently being commissioned, with first observations starting before the end of 2019.",

Some have already been decommissioned and/or are being upgraded since they are reaching the end of their physical lifetime or are merely reaching the maximum of their capabilities (being thermal-noise or systematic-error limited). Entirely new ground-based instruments are also coming online or are being designed at the moment (e.g. NenuFAR, HERA, SKA) to push boundaries various parameter spaces and which will likely dominate 21-cm signal science in the coming decade or two. However, what lies beyond these instruments? What is still \"left to do\" when those future instruments have maximised their science return?",

The challenges that are facing ground-based instruments are impossible to overcome to reach those objectives ( [24] ). For example, at frequencies corresponding to Dark Ages redshifts, any radio signal from the sky is almost 100% distorted by the ionosphere on time-scales of seconds with variable distortions over arcminutes scales. It is therefore impossible to correct for these errors and space instruments will be needed in order to observe the Dark Ages and image the Cosmic Dawn.",

Moreover, space environment is not ubiquituosly RFI free, like Earth orbits. An optimal location is either in deep space where the earth becomes a faint radio source that can be dealt with using traditional excision techniques -but where the sun remains a source of noise -, the back-side of the moon (e.g. FARSIDE, [8] ) or in lunar orbit (e.g. DSL, DAPPER, [11] , [9] ), where it will be shielded from both the earth and the sun for a fraction of time. It should also be kept in mind that the lunar surface is partly charged due to solar radiation and cosmic rays and hence even on the lunar surface effects of a lunar \"ionosphere\" are not completely absent. On the other hand, reflections of radio waves from the lunar surface back to any orbiter could lead to multi-path propagation and also need mitigation since the dynamic range of the signal can be as high as 10 8 for the Dark Ages (a 10 5 K foreground sky versus a mK signal).",

As the number of visibilities per spatial or uv-resolution element and their thermal noise determines the power spectrum sensitivity, future instruments will feature an increased number of receiving elements that are cross-correlated (therefore measuring more modes) together with a larger collecting area (measuring each model with more sensitivity). [24] suggests that the collecting area necessary to observe the Dark Ages will be as large as 10 \u2212 100 km 2 in order to overcome the sky-dominated noise from foregrounds that are \u223c 10 5 K bright. Despite these challenges, the information contained in the 21-cm signal during the Dark Ages and the early Cosmic Dawn will shed light on fundamental physics as well on the astrophysics of the infant Universe, making these developments worth the effort.",
