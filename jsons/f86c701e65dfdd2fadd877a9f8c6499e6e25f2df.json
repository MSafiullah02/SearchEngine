The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%.

However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.",

At the time of writing, only two African countries, Lesotho and Comoros, had not reported any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections 2 . In these and other low-income settings, two factors (younger age distributions and, potentially, warmer temperatures 4,5 ) may help to attenuate the pandemic's severity. However, other factors may plausibly combine to worsen its impact: these include demography (larger household sizes and more intergenerational mixing within households), environmental conditions (overcrowded urban settlements, inadequate water and sanitation), pre-existing disease burden (higher prevalence of undiagnosed or unmanaged non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis and, if confirmed to be risk factors for COVID-19 severity, HIV and undernutrition), and, critically, a very low baseline of and access to hospitalisation capacity, particularly intensive and sub-intensive care 6-10 .

Across all three countries, reducing all contacts outside the household by an extreme of 100%, if sustained over the entire 12 months period, could result in a median reduction in severe cases by over 90%. However, this would largely delay rather than prevent severe cases, as insufficient levels of herd-immunity would develop, leading to a second wave of cases following the relaxation of measures. Relatively high reductions in contacts are needed for large impacts. Patterns were largely consistent across countries. Stratified results by 0 are shown in Supplemental Figure S10 . Impact can vary substantially between settings with low and high 0 , reflected by the wide intervals here. For instance, when reducing 40% of contacts outside of the household, reduction in severe cases in the first 12 months of the epidemic could be as low as 18% in scenarios with an 0 above 3, while it could be as high as 71% in scenarios with an 0 below 2. .

Supplemental Figure S3 illustrates this phenomenon: when all interventions except self-isolation are lifted after 12 months, scenarios where physical distancing has reduced transmission outside the household by 50% in the first year may feature a second, albeit smaller peak during the second year if no further mitigation measures are taken; this further peak is absent under the other strategies.

Short of an indefinite-duration lock-down, none of the interventions would likely avert very large epidemics that result in high mortality and extreme pressure on health services. However, both self-isolation of symptomatic people and moderate physical distancing could translate into relatively moderate but, in absolute terms, very sizable reductions in severe cases and deaths. The shielding option would likely require high levels of adherence and isolation to yield appreciable reductions in health service pressure, but could have a higher potential to reduce mortality in the short-term than other interventions, as it focuses on those who experience the highest CFR. This option also promotes herd immunity through mixing of other age groups and thus carries a lesser risk of further epidemic peaks once measures are lifted. Different shielding arrangements could be considered, ranging from individual arrangements wherever people already live in multi-room houses or compounds, to neighbours or extended family-members grouping the most vulnerable individuals in vacated houses, to larger, albeit epidemiologically riskier re-housing (e.g. in quarantined street blocks). To avoid the problem of transmission within the shielded population, all such arrangements would need to eliminate any traffic of external people in and out of shielded accommodation as much as possible ensuring basic needs are met, while also instituting infection control barriers, e.g. a designated exchange point for supplies and safe social interactions and limiting contact within the shielded population. While our model does not explore the micro-level dynamics of how seeding of infection into these accommodations would affect residents, we showed, as expected, that the amount of contact among high-risk shielded people matters: zero contact, equivalent to individual shielding, equates to the highest effect of the intervention, while an increase of contact from baseline, e.g. if shielded people are rehoused in more crowded conditions than in their households of origin, dampens the utility of this approach and could even lead to an increase in cases compared to the baseline of no intervention.",

Our predictions suggest that countrywide lockdowns of two months, if effective, would temporarily suppress and delay epidemics for around 2 months, as noted in Europe: this reprieve would potentially enable countries to mobilise resources and plan the implementation of the next phase of their strategy. These findings do not in themselves support lockdown measures as a universal solution, however: such measures may be ineffective (i.e. fail to achieve a contact rate reduction consistent with effective reproduction number < 1, the condition for suppression) or more harmful than beneficial, including in health terms, if they severely disrupt economies and livelihoods or encounter mistrust and community resistance.

Physical distancing entails a difficult trade-off between reducing attack rates (and hence epidemic peak size) and extending the duration of the epidemic, which in turn increases the period over which shielding should be maintained (as individuals will require to be shielded until well after the epidemic peak has finished). While stringent physical distancing (e.g. 50% reduction in extra-household contacts) would have a large impact, such reductions may only be achieved through socio-economically damaging and potentially unacceptable restrictions to work, education and/or other forms of public life. By contrast, a 20% reduction in transmission may be more achievable and sustainable -in some settings, this could involve a combination of hygiene promotion, increased access to water, soap and other cleaning supplies (e.g. through state subsidies) and curtailment of some gatherings outside of work and school. It is unknown at present whether shielding is at all feasible and can attain our suggested target of 80% contact reduction between high-and low-risk people for 80% of high-risk people. Even at lower effectiveness levels, however, shielding would still offer benefits, particularly in terms of mortality, and accordingly need not be discounted as an option, particularly if it can be designed and led by communities themselves 33 , thereby requiring fewer resources than a top-down intervention.",

Walker et al. 39 used a similar SEIR model and predicted a near 90% reduction in cases for sub-Saharan Africa assuming a 75% reduction in contacts starting at an incidence of 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population per week and sustained over the first 250 days of an epidemic. Comparisons between these studies are complicated due to different time periods of models and strategies investigated, but both point to a large unmitigated epidemic which can be reduced substantially due to strong physical distancing measures.

Transmissibility may vary considerably across Africa, and it is possible that countries with very concentrated urban populations would see an acute exponential rise in cases, with a secondary, flatter curve affecting outlying rural regions: models accounting for these very distinct settlement types may be more useful for national planning. Consequently, the duration of time that countries will be affected by COVID-19 according to our model should be treated with caution. While we accounted for age distributions, we did not have country-specific data on contact patterns among age groups. Instead, we used synthetic contact matrices extrapolated from European data by using local data on household, workplace and school composition in the African settings considered. A sensitivity analysis with empirical African contact pattern data suggested lower effects of general distancing and higher effects of shielding, but these matrices were collected in specific areas and may not be representative of contact patterns within the entire country or indeed Africa as a whole.",

We applied age-specific risks of developing severe disease per infection, as estimated using data from China and the Diamond Princess outbreak, but shifted these to earlier life by a decade to represent plausible differences in biological age in Africa resulting from life-course exposures. This crude approach may be confounded by differences in the agespecific prevalence of co-morbidities in African countries, as well as inter-country differences in comorbidity prevalence. Specifically, conditions with potential (tuberculosis 39 ) and as yet undocumented (HIV, undernutrition, sickle-cell disease) interactions with SARS-CoV-2 infection are far more prevalent in Africa than China and affect relatively young age groups 10 : these could increase COVID-19 severity overall and shift the distribution of severe cases to younger age. Additionally, the proportion of detected and correctly managed cases of non-communicable diseases of known import to COVID-19 progression (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease) is far lower in most of Africa than in China and Europe: this may further exacerbate disease severity. These differing patterns of co-morbidity may also affect the proportion of patients requiring intensive care and case-fatality: for the latter, we have provided illustrative findings assuming age-constant increases in Africa compared to China, based on an assumption of very limited treatment.

Self-isolation and moderate physical distancing can be effective interventions. The shielding option can be proactively explored to test locally appropriate solutions. As the epidemic progresses, real-time modelling and strategy evaluation should be made available to African countries that do not yet have this expertise: this requires coordination and proactive support from the worldwide scientific community, as well as close exchange of information between modelling teams and country-based surveillance, so as to gradually refine predictions.

This analysis shows shielding to be comparatively more sensitive to changes in contact among shielded individuals, with a substantial loss of effect when shielded people greatly increase their contacts, e.g. if they are rehoused in overcrowded conditions. Sensitivity to transmissibility assumption ( 0 ) Uncertainty intervals in our results were mainly reflective of the range of 0 values we sampled in the model.
