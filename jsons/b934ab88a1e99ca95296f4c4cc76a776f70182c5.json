The most common pathological hallmark of these age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of specific proteins, including amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), TAR DNAbinding protein 43 (TDP43), and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) peptides, in the intra-and extracellular spaces of selected brain regions. Whereas it remains controversial whether these accumulations are pathogenic or merely a byproduct of disease, the majority of therapeutic research has focused on clearing protein aggregates. Immunotherapies have garnered particular attention for their ability to target specific protein strains and conformations as well as promote clearance. Immunotherapies can also be neuroprotective: by neutralizing extracellular protein aggregates, they reduce spread, synaptic damage, and neuroinflammation. This review will briefly examine the current state of research in immunotherapies against the 3 most commonly targeted proteins for age-related neurodegenerative disease: A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-syn. The discussion will then turn to combinatorial strategies that enhance the effects of immunotherapy against aggregating protein, followed by new potential targets of immunotherapy such as aging-related processes.",

In 2011, the USA enacted the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) (Public Law 111-375). The Act defines \"Alzheimer's\" as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs), including FTD, DLB, and VCID. The law calls for the development of treatments to prevent or slow the rate of AD progression by the year 2025, as well as a national plan and coordination among international bodies to fight AD on a global scale [7] . As a result, funding for AD research via the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has increased substantially within the last 5 years, jumping from 600 million dollars per year to approximately 2.8 billion. The NIA and its sister institutes and centers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), use milestones Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s13311-020-00853-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. and recommendations from the AD Summits held at the NIH Bethesda campus to prioritize areas of research.",

These proteins have been shown to accumulate several years prior to clinically observable cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms [14, 15] . Whereas there remains some debate as to whether protein accumulation is pathogenic or merely a byproduct of disease [16] (Fig. 1) , the majority of therapeutic research has been focused on clearing these aggregates [17] [18] [19] [20] . AD, DLB, PD, and FTD are thus often defined as proteinopathies of the aging population that display selective degeneration of neuronal circuitries and progressive accumulation of specific proteins such as amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) [10, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] among many others (Fig. 1) . AD plaque and tangle formation are most frequently associated with A\u03b2 and tau, whereas the primary protein component of Lewy bodies in PD and DLB is \u03b1-syn [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] (Fig. 2) . FTD aggregates are generally comprised of tau, TDP-43, or Fused in sarcoma (FUS) [30, 31] , but cases with a GGGGCC expansion mutation in intron 1 of the C9ORF72 gene also present with accumulations of TDP43 and repeat-associated non-AUG-dependent (RAN) translation proteins [32] . It must be pointed out, however, that \u03b1-syn and TDP43 aggregates are also commonly found in AD, as well as A\u03b2, tau, and TDP43 in DLB [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] (Fig. 2) . Moreover, recent studies have shown significant overlap in AD and PD pathology in which a single individual over the age of 80 can present with aggregates of several of the above proteins [36] (Fig. 2 ). As such, simultaneously targeting multiple aggregating protein species may be more effective at treating these disorders than monotherapy [36, 37] .",

These include gene therapy to bolster clearance and degradation (e.g., autophagy, proteolysis, lysosomal degradation) [46] , anti-sense technology to block synthesis (e.g., tau and \u03b1-syn genes) [47] [48] [49] , small molecules to decrease aggregation (e.g., Fig. 1 Combined mechanisms of neurodegeneration in AD/ADRD include protein accumulation and aging-related pathways. In the neurodegenerative process of AD/ADRD, synaptic damage and neuroinflammation may lead to neuronal dysfunction which results in dementia and motor deficits. The leading hypothesis is that progressive accumulation of proteins such as amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) is the primary culprit. However, aging is also likely to play a critical role in pathogenesis, either in synergy with protein accumulation or as an independent pathway. Aging processes relevant to neurodegeneration include inflammation, proteostasis, DNA damage, cell senescence, and mitochondrial alterations Fig. 2 Overlapping protein aggregate pathology in AD/ADRD. Although A\u03b2 and tau are classically associated with AD, \u03b1-syn with Lewy body dementia, and TDP43 and tau with FTD and limbic associated TDP43 encephalopathy (LATE), it is becoming increasingly evident that older individuals with dementia (+ 80 years old) display mixed pathology inhibitors of A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-syn oligomers and higher-order aggregates) [50] [51] [52] [53] , and immunotherapy to enhance clearance, degradation, and decrease aggregation (Fig. 3) . Immunotherapies have garnered particular attention for their specificity [54, 55] . This review will discuss 2 types of immunotherapy: active vaccines, in which inactivated fragments of the pathogenic protein are directly administered to produce a long-lasting immune response, and passive immunization, in which patients are infused with antibodies against the target protein. Both strategies can modulate inflammation, prevent future oligomerization and aggregation activity [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] , and promote clearance by phagocytic microglia or lysosomal degradation via the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway [67] . Other immunotherapy modalities, including T-cell modulation or harnessing cellular immunity to target neurodegeneration pathways, are discussed elsewhere [68, 69] .",

Its inherent specificity allows for selective targeting of specific strains and conformations with less off-target effects [61, [70] [71] [72] (Fig. 4) . Polyvalent single-chain antibodies or combinations of antibodies and vaccines may also allow for the simultaneous targeting of multiple protein aggregate species [60, [73] [74] [75] [76] (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, immunotherapies can be neuroprotective by neutralizing extracellular protein aggregates and thereby reducing subsequent spread, synaptic damage, and neuroinflammation [77] . The very concept of immunotherapy for AD originated from the observation that the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide accumulates extracellularly and is therefore accessible to antibodies that can recruit microglia to clear such deposits [78] (Fig. 4) . It was accordingly considered unlikely that intracellular protein aggregates such as those of tau, \u03b1-syn, TDP43, and RAN would be good targets for immunotherapy. However, the advent of new technology to facilitate intracellular trafficking of antibodies [79] [80] [81] [82] and the discovery that these so-called intracellular proteins also exist in cell membranes and extracellular spaces have driven immunotherapy development forward for PD, DLB, and FTD [59, 62, 63, 83, 84] .",

With its catalytic subunit presenilin, \u03b3-secretase further cleaves the cell membrane fragment to release the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. Mutations in the genes encoding APP or presenilin carry the greatest incidence of familial AD [92] . Under nonpathological conditions, there is evidence that A\u03b2 is involved in regulating synaptic function and even acting as an antimicrobial peptide to protect against infection and injury [93] [94] [95] . The A\u03b2 peptide can be of varying lengths, the most prevalent being A\u03b240. Longer forms, such as A\u03b242, are less soluble and are prone to accumulate extracellularly to form oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and ultimately, plaques [90, 91, [96] [97] [98] .",

The vaccine produced long-lasting and nearly complete clearance of A\u03b2 deposits in many patients, but had no impact on the prominent tau pathology and severe dementia [100, 101] . The trial was halted after 4 patients developed meningoencephalitis related to T-cell infiltration. Successful mapping of the Bcell epitope to the N-terminus of A\u03b2 [102] [103] [104] and additional work on Th2-biased adjuvants [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] were thus essential to the future A\u03b2 vaccine development, allowing for a robust antibody response without the potentially harmful Th1 lymphocyte activation [108] . Vanutide cridificar (ACC-001) was designed as such to include only the B-cell epitope of A\u03b2 plus QS-21 adjuvant [109] . Phase II trials for ACC-001, however, did not reach efficacy endpoints for cognitive evaluations, volumetric brain MRI, and CSF biomarkers, and development was halted in 2013 [110, 111] . Another recent strategy has been to use mimotopes, synthetic peptides that closely resemble the target protein epitope, as active vaccines. AFFITOPE\u00ae AD02 by Affiris (Wien, Austria), a 6-amino-acid peptide that mimics the A\u03b2 N-terminus, was regrettably also terminated in phase II for lack of clinical efficacy [112] .",

Bapineuzumab targets the A\u03b2 N-terminus to mediate clearance of both soluble and fibrillar forms, but did not meet clinical endpoints in phase III and, moreover, produced amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with edema in patients that received a high dose [122] . Solanezumab, humanized murine antibody m266, is specific for soluble monomeric A\u03b2 and is proposed to operate by the peripheral sink hypothesis, in which removal of A\u03b2 in the periphery also leads to a reduction in the brain by passive diffusion [123] . Multiple phase III trials, including one in early AD patients, either failed to meet clinical efficacy or were terminated early for futility [124, 125] (Table 1) . Similarly, phase III trials for crenezumab, human monoclonal IgG4 against oligomeric, fibrillar, and plaque conformations of A\u03b2, were stopped early in Jan 2019 for futility [126] . However, a phase II prevention trial with crenezumab in P r e s e n i l i n 1 ( P S E N 1 ) E 2 8 0 A m u t a t i o n c a r r i e r s (NCT01998841) is still underway as part of the API-Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD) trial in Fig. 4 Multiple mechanisms of action of immunotherapy in AD/ ADRD.

Although phase III was halted earlier this year, the company that developed this antibody is now seeking FDA approval with new analysis of a larger data set [85, 130] (Table 1) . Similarly, although development of human IgG1 gantenerumab was halted in 2014 for futility, a new phase III trial was initiated at a higher dose (NCT03444870) after the open label extension demonstrated a dramatic decline in A\u03b2 deposition in participants [131] . Both gantenerumab and solanezumab are also being revived as potential preventative therapies by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) in patients with AD-causing mutations (NCT01760005) [132] . Unfortunately, topline analyses in February 2020 showed that both drugs failed to meet primary endpoints [133] . Preventative trials for sporadic AD are also underway, in which the so-called A4 phase III trial (NCT02008357) tests solanezumab at higher doses and for longer durations in asymptomatic patients with preclinical AD as defined by positive amyloid PET scans [134] . This phase III trial recruited over 1200 participants and will be reporting in the next couple of years. Humanized murine mAb158 BAN2401 (NCT03887455) is the only other passive immunotherapy currently in phase III, but has already produced very promising results in phase II. Specifically, the 18-month study demonstrated a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline at the highest dose with less than 10% of subjects experiencing ARIA [135] . The antibody is specific to soluble A\u03b2 protofibrils, which have been proposed to be the toxic species rather than the plaques themselves [136] (Table 1 ).",

The antibodies currently being tested in clinical trials target a variety of A\u03b2 species, including soluble, oligomeric, and fibrillar A\u03b2. Mechanisms of action include microglia-facilitated removal of extracellular amyloid oligomers and fibrils, blocking primary and secondary A\u03b2 nucleation, and targeting monomers and soluble A\u03b2 in the periphery that could otherwise trigger A\u03b2 accumulation in the CNS. Rather than for late-stage disease reversal, immunotherapy against A\u03b2 aggregates appears to be more appropriate for prevention initiatives with prolonged treatments past 78 weeks at high doses guided by reliable biomarkers. ApoE4 carriers exposed to high doses, however, are susceptible to complications such as ARIA-E and may need to be closely monitored by MRI [137] .",

DLB/PD is the second most common cause of dementia and parkinsonism in the aging population after AD, affecting about 1 million in the USA [140] . \u03b1-syn is a presynaptic protein reported to be involved in endosomal formation and vesicle release at the synapse [141, 142] . The pathological hallmarks of PD and DLB are intraneuronal occlusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that are composed of fibrillar \u03b1-syn along with cytoskeletal and other synaptic proteins [143] . \u03b1-syn accumulation can also occur in glia, such as glial cytoplasmic inclusion (GCIs) in MSA patient oligodendrocytes or Lewy body-like structures in the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex of AD and Down syndrome patients [143] [144] [145] . Although astrocytes and microglia do not constitutively express \u03b1-syn, they actively uptake extracellular \u03b1-syn which can lead to glial aggregates in conditions of impaired clearance [146] [147] [148] . This is supported by increasing evidence that small amounts of \u03b1-syn aggregates are released from neurons into the extracellular space and subsequently interact with glial receptors such as Tolllike receptor 2 to trigger a pro-inflammatory response [40, 146, [149] [150] [151] [152] .",

            "text": "The original approach to use antibodies to target and remove amyloid plaques from the brain made intuitive sense given that A\u03b2 aggregates are found in the extracellular space [99] . It was unclear how this method might be applied to DLB, PD, and other synucleinopathies, as the majority of the proteinaceous aggregates were thought to form within neurons of the striatonigral system, limbic areas, and deep layers of the neocortex. In the early 2000s, however, we showed that immunization of a newly developed \u03b1-syn transgenic model (Line D, PDGF-\u03b1-syn wt) with recombinant human \u03b1-syn mixed with Freund adjuvant resulted in the production of high titer antibodies against C-terminal \u03b1-syn that were capable of removing \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons and ameliorating neurodegeneration and functional deficits [153] . Through additional active and passive immunization experiments in transgenic, viral, and preformed fibril injection models [154, 155] , we learned that these antibodies had multiple mechanisms of action, such as recognizing \u03b1-syn aggregates in the membrane and triggering endocytosis and clearance via autophagy, lysosomal activity, or proteasomal degradation [156] [157] [158] [159] (Fig. 4) . Moreover, antibodies can be trafficked intracellularly with single-chain antibodies or intrabodies specifically engineered to penetrate the cell membrane via apolipoprotein B (ApoB), TAT fusion proteins, or uptake by endogenous receptors [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] (Fig. 4) . Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), for example, are designed to retain the specificity of the original full-length antibody without activating unwanted Fcmediated responses [160, 161, 166] . Several studies have shown that transgenic mice injected with viral vectors encoding scFvs against A\u03b2 [167] [168] [169] , \u03b1-syn [81, 170] , or tau [171, 172] show long-term in vivo scFv expression, improved functional deficits, and reduced pathogenic protein accumulation. Intrabody technology is continuing to be improved, such as in a recent study in which Chatterjee et al. (2018) enhanced the solubility of single-domain immunoglobulin fragments by engineering a polypeptide tether construct, and demonstrated its protective effects on motor function when delivered by gene therapy to a PD rodent model [173] .",

Antibodies can also block \u03b1-syn oligomerization and fibrillation, target specific strains and isoforms, prevent cell-to-cell transmission, and facilitate clearance via microglia [61, 149, 155, 176] . Therefore, antibodies can target both intracellular and extracellular \u03b1-syn aggregates as they spread from cell to cell (Fig. 4) . This approach has been since applied to other proteinopathies with predominantly intracellular accumulations of tau, TDP43 [177, 178] , SOD1 [179] [180] [181] , RAN peptides [32] , and Huntingtin (Htt) [182, 183] . Additional lessons from \u03b1-syn immunotherapy studies include the use of antibodies to develop blood, CSF, and tissue biomarkers to monitor the effects of immunotherapy and the ability of Cterminus-specific antibodies to block protease-mediated C-terminus truncation of \u03b1-syn and subsequently prevent oligomerization and transmission [59, 153, [156] [157] [158] (Fig. 4) .",

            "text": "In this context, 2 main strategies for \u03b1-syn immunotherapy have been pursued: mimotope vaccines and antibodies against the N-or C-terminal ends of \u03b1-syn or specific conformations of oligomeric and fibrillar \u03b1-syn (Fig. 4) . Whereas most antibodies have been developed with recombinant or synthetic \u03b1syn monomers or aggregates, a recent and novel variant uses antibodies cloned from human healthy volunteers producing high titers of auto-antibodies against \u03b1-syn [184] [185] [186] . As a result of seminal cell-free in vitro and in vivo studies, several immunotherapies are currently been tested in clinical trial for synucleinopathies. The vaccines AFFITOPE\u00ae PD01A and PD03A were well tolerated in phase I and produced a dosedependent immune response in patients with early MSA, but plans for phase II have yet to be disclosed [187, 188] . For passive immunotherapies, prasinezumab (also known as PRX002 or RO7046015) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the C-terminus of \u03b1-syn undergoing phase II trials in patients with early PD (NCT03100149) [189] ( Table 2) . A phase I trial for BIIB054, a human monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to aggregated \u03b1-syn, was recently concluded and showed favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles [190] (Table 2 ). MEDI1341 is also in phase I clinical trial testing (NCT03272165) as an antibody that can bind both monomers and aggregates. In preclinical studies, MEDI1341 was shown to readily cross the blood-brain barrier and block transmission of \u03b1-syn aggregates in a combined viral vector model [191] (Table 2 ).",

Other rising immunotherapy strategies are T-cell modulation, such as that of Copaxone\u00ae [192] , and combinatorial approaches. We have tested several of such combinations, including simultaneous administration of 2 AFFITOPEs\u00ae against A\u03b2 and \u03b1-syn [74, 193] , nanoparticles containing both recombinant human \u03b1-syn and the immunomodulatory drug rapamycin, and the anti-inflammatory drug thalidomide given alongside a single-chain antibody against oligomeric \u03b1-syn derived from human DLB/PD brains and conjugated to ApoB [73] . Through these studies in DLB/PD mouse models, we show that combined immunotherapy may be more effective than monotherapy. This topic will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. The main challenge in the field of synucleinopathies is the lack of reliable and accessible biomarkers and the overlapping pathology among neurodegenerative diseases.",

By binding to tubulin dimers, tau can stabilize microtubule formation and modulate cytoskeletal dynamics [195] . The degree to which tau is phosphorylated is an important regulator of microtubule stability [196] . Nonphosphorylated forms preferentially bind to microtubules, whereas hyperphosphorylation is associated with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation from paired helical filaments (PHF) [197, 198] . Intracellular NFTs are a major hallmark lesion of AD and other neurodegenerative tauopathies such as FTD, cortico-basal degeneration, Pick's disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) [199] . The severity of tau pathology has been shown to correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment and neuronal loss [200] [201] [202] [203] , making the tau protein an attractive target for new immunotherapies.",

DC8E8 has been recently characterized as a promising antibody that targets tau at 4 homologous epitopes present in each microtubule binding domain repeat [217] . DC8E8 was shown to not only preferentially bind truncated pathological tau over physiological tau but also prevent both the formation of beta sheets and the uptake of tau into neurons via sulfated heparan proteoglycans (HSPGs) [218] . In another study, Courade et al. (2018) identified an antibody against the central region of tau, dubbed \"antibody D,\" that was effective at blocking tau seeding in vitro [219] . Albert et al. (2019) further observed that this central tau epitope antibody was more efficacious at preventing AD-like pathology and cell-to-cell transfer of tau in mice [84] .",

Antibodies targeting A\u03b2 have led the way with a number of phase III trials and at least one that reported meeting primary outcome measures, followed closely behind by a handful of immunotherapies for \u03b1-syn and tau in phase I and II trials. Whereas accessible biomarkers are currently available for A\u03b2-and tau-related pathologies to guide the immunotherapy trials, there is a pressing lack of such measures for synucleinopathies. The other challenge at hand is that older patients present with protein aggregates that are no longer primarily one pathologic protein species but comprised of A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, TDP43, and others, in addition to aging-related processes such as inflammation, proteotasis deficits, DNA damage, mitochondrial alterations, and stem cell alterations. Thus, there is a dire need to develop reliable biomarkers and powerful combinatorial therapies to address these polyproteinopathies and age-related pathophysiological alterations, as will be discussed in the following section.",

AD patients have been shown to display elevated levels of \u03b1-syn in the CSF [247, 248] , and further, A\u03b2 may promote \u03b1-syn aggregation and toxicity [249, 250] . In mouse models, hippocampal neurons with \u03b1-syn accumulations were found to be more susceptible to A\u03b2-mediated toxicity [251] , whereas genetic depletion of \u03b1-syn prevented the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and attenuated behavioral deficits [39, 252] . Similarly, \u03b1-syn has been shown to directly interact with PSEN1, which is important for the proteolytic processing of the APP to yield A\u03b2 [231] . \u03b1-syn infusion in APP Tg mice also blocked A\u03b2 seeding but enhanced synaptic degeneration [253, 254] , potentially by blocking SNARE-vesicle fusion in a cooperative manner [255] . We recently covaccinated a double transgenic mouse model of DLB (mThy1-hAPP-and mThy1-\u03b1-syn) with AFFITOPE peptides against A\u03b2 (AD02) and \u03b1-syn (PD1A) [74] . Remarkably, targeting one protein often concomitantly lowered the accumulation of another, in which AD02 effectively reduced A\u03b2 pathology as well as that of phosphorylated tau and \u03b1-syn. This study also noted potential additive effects, particularly in alleviating behavioral deficits, suggesting that a combined immunotherapy approach may be appropriate for the heterogenous pathology of AD and DLB and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 5) .",

Many studies have demonstrated that \u03b1-syn interacts with and catalyzes the oligomerization of tau [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] . \u03b1-syn may also demonstrate 14-3-3 cochaperone activity on 14-3-3 targets, including tau, promoting mutual misfolding [263] [264] [265] . \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils were shown to induce intracellular tau aggregation in vivo [266] , and may be closely involved in the GSK3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of tau in a reciprocal manner [267] [268] [269] [270] . \u03b1syn oligomers may induce a distinctly toxic tau oligomeric strain in a cross-seeding effect [271, 272] or even form coaggregates [273] . A recent paper also reported that an age-dependent reduction in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity was associated with accumulations of lipid-stabilized \u03b1-syn and phosphorylated tau [274] . As such, a combination of immunotherapies against both tau and \u03b1-syn may be especially effective for cases in which both tau and synuclein pathology are present, as it can not only remove existing aggregates and toxic species but also prevent future cross-seeding events.",

            "text": "The ultimate approach would be to develop immunotherapies that simultaneously target A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, TDP43, and inflammation (Fig. 5 ). This could be achieved by 1) combining vaccines against A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, and TDP43 among other proteins; 2) combining antibodies against A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, and TDP43; 3) combining passive and active immunization; or 4) using multivalent single-chain antibodies that can target 2 or more of these proteins simultaneously. Another approach would be to design antibodies to recognize a conformation that is similar across multiple protein aggregate species, rather than a specific sequence. Interestingly, studies in APP and \u03b1syn transgenic models have demonstrated that some antibodies against oligomeric tau are effective at reducing \u03b1-syn, whereas others have suggested that antibodies against A\u03b2 may also target tau [61, 275] . Moreover, a combined vaccination approach targeting A\u03b2 and tau has been shown to decrease disease pathology in Tau22/5xFAD double transgenic mice [276] . As such, a combination of these polyfunctional antibodies is another way of maximizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Fig. 5) . Combination immunotherapies for AD/ADRD targeting protein aggregates and aging-related pathways. Immunotherapy can also be used to target other pathogens and age-related pathogenic processes associated with aging. One such pathogen may be the herpes simplex virus (#1). Aging-related pathways that can be targeted with antibodies include inflammation (e.g., TNF, TLR2, inflammasome) (#2), senescent cells (e.g., DPP4) (#3), and immune surveillance cells (e.g., NK cells) (#4). Immunotherapies in neurodegeneration have been traditionally developed to target protein aggregates (e.g., A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, TDP43) (#5) alone or in combination (#6). Combination therapies may involve targeting multiple protein aggregates (#6) or protein aggregates (#5) and agerelated pathways (#1-4) Given the aforementioned copathology, immunotherapy may also be effective in combination with gene silencing approaches. Several studies have shown that \u03b1-syn and tau deletion in animal transgenic models can delay the onset of disease. For example, \u03b1-syn knockout prevented neurotoxininduced neurodegeneration in MPTP and rotenone PD mouse models [277, 278] . Injecting modified anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting SNCA similarly promoted survival of TH-positive neurons and ameliorated motor deficits in mice expressing wild-type or mutant human SNCA [49] . Another recent study found that tau deletion in A53T \u03b1-syn tg mice rescued some cognitive and synaptic deficits without affecting \u03b1-syn expression or phosphorylation [279] . Gene therapy is also progressing in human neurodegenerative diseases, most notably nusinersen for the neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy [280, 281] . As such, immunotherapy to clear existing aggregates and anti-sense therapy to prevent further translation of pathologic proteins may be a viable combination, particularly in early stages of the disease.",

In this regard, although this review was focused on antibody-based immunotherapy, targeting cellular immunity is another attractive approach to treat neurodegenerative disorders given its ability to reduce the protein aggregate load by targeting T cells. We developed a mixed cellular and active immunization in which \u03b1-syn and rapamycin are simultaneously delivered in an antigen-presenting celltargeting glucan microparticle (GP) vaccine system [193] . In this case, the \u03b1-syn peptide elicits the production of antibodies against \u03b1-syn, whereas rapamycin triggered the recruitment of Tregs into the CNS. In turn, the Tregs immunomodulate microglia and induce greater microglial clearance of \u03b1-syn aggregates and reduced neurodegeneration and inflammation in \u03b1-syn tg mice. This vaccine, collectively termed GP+RAP/\u03b1syn, was capable of triggering neuroprotective Treg responses in synucleinopathy animal models, and the combined vaccine was more effective than the humoral or cellular immunization alone. These results demonstrate the promise of multifunctional vaccine approaches for the treatment of AD and DLB/ PD.",

Moreover, senescent and immune cells can be targeted with specific antibodies. For example, a recent study used antibodies against the surface molecule DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) of senescent cells [283] to facilitate their clearance (Fig. 5) . Antibodies against interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Toll-like receptors may also be effective at modulating the immune response in neurodegenerative disease [284] [285] [286] [287] . Previous studies have shown that A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-syn toxicity are mediated by the inflammasome [288] [289] [290] . In the case of synucleinopathies, we have shown that extracellular \u03b1-syn aggregates bind to TLR2 to trigger neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and that selective neutralizing antibodies against TLR2 were effective at blocking these effects and behavior deficits in \u03b1syn tg animals [152, 291] . In fact, TLR2 has been developed as an important novel target for synucleinopathies [57, 292] (Fig. 5) .",

These immunotherapy approaches may certainly also be amenable for combination with gene therapy (e.g., anti-sense), small molecules (e.g., autophagy modulators, antiaggregation, senolytics), and nonpharmacological (e.g., exercise, diet, training) treatments. Combinatorial therapeutics will also open exciting opportunities for personalized medicine, including catering to different stages of disease. For example, immunotherapy with anti-sense as described above may be wellsuited to presymptomatic stages of disease. Another early intervention may be to combine immunotherapy with means of upregulating proteostasis components such as chemical chaperones or gene therapy for BiP or XBP1 to prevent further misfolding and aggregation [308] [309] [310] [311] . Following the onset of significant pathological changes or clinical symptoms, however, polyvalent immunotherapy may be needed to address the frequent presence of multiple pathogenic proteins. Combining polyvalent antibodies with stress signaling inhibitors or regenerative therapy may prevent further synaptic loss and delay progression of symptoms [312] [313] [314] .",

            "text": "Furthermore, different combinations may be used to cater to not only the stage of disease but also the patient's specific symptoms, lifestyle risk factors, and genetic risk factors. For instance, given alone, the therapeutic efficacy of statins or antihypertensives for AD [315] [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] and PD [322] [323] [324] [325] [326] [327] [328] patients remains largely inconclusive. However, a patient presenting with overlapping pathology from both AD and VCID may benefit from a combination of protein-targeting immunotherapy and such cardiovascular disease treatments. Current preventative immunotherapy trials such as that of the API are also just the beginning of genetics-based treatments. Many key initiatives for genetics research in neurodegenerative disease, such as the International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC), are spearheading a movement for accessible analytics tools and diverse and representative data. In the future, we may be able to use this groundwork to identify a patient's specific risk variants and ultimately design a combinatorial therapy that can address both the protein accumulation and the biological associations for those variants. Let it also not be forgotten, however, that in addition to further development of these therapeutic strategies, there is a dire need for an overhaul of current policy and clinical trial practices in order to truly pursue combinatorial and personalized medicine for diseases as complex as age-related neurodegeneration.",
