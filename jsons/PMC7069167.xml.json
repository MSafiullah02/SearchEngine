Main interventions in critical care, such as early tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, intracranial pressure monitoring - in order to quantify cerebral perfusion pressure - aim to reduce the risk for secondary neurologic injuries. Avoiding hypoxemia, hypercarbia and arterial hypotension are essential to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation and intracranial pressure (ICP) homeostasis. Presumably, the integrity of the respiratory system is a substantial element for optimal respiratory care in patients with moderate to severe TBI. In thoracic trauma, however, impaired alveolar gas exchange occurs frequently, resulting from lung contusions, pleural pathologies, disturbed ventilation mechanics or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A recently published retrospective analysis found severe thoracic trauma to be a risk factor for early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia with negative consequences on cerebral oxygenation [1].",

The TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae of the German Trauma Society was founded in 1993. The aim of this multi-center database is a pseudonymised and standardized documentation of severely injured patients. Data are collected prospectively in consecutive time phases from the site of the accident until discharge from hospital. The documentation includes detailed information on demographics, injury pattern, comorbidities, pre- and in-hospital management, course on intensive care unit and outcome of each individual. Trauma patients who are admitted via the emergency room with subsequent intensive care or intermediate care treatment (ICU/ICM) or those who reach the hospital with vital signs and die before admission to ICU are included. Participating hospitals are primarily located in Germany (90%), but a rising number of hospitals of other countries - with differing treatment algorithms - contribute data as well. Currently, approx. 35,000 cases from almost 700 hospitals are entered into the database per year. Participation in TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae is voluntary. For hospitals associated with TraumaNetzwerk DGU\u00ae, however, the entry of at least a basic data set is obligatory for reasons of quality assurance. As a compulsory tool for quality assessment, no informed consent is necessary for data collection. Participation in TraumaRegister-DGU\u00ae and analysis of data are approved by the participants\u2019 institutional ethical review boards. Scientific data analysis is approved according to a peer-review procedure established by the Committee on Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care and Trauma Management (Sektion NIS) of the German Trauma Society. The TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae is approved by the review board of the German Trauma Society and is in compliance with the institutional requirements of its members. The present study is in line with the publication guidelines of the TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae and registered as TR-DGU project ID 2017\u2013040.",

Impaired neurologic recovery would be expected in case of serious or critical thoracic injuries, as these are frequently associated with severe hypoxemia or hypercarbia (i.e. pleural pathologies, lung contusions, ARDS) and circulatory shock - conditions which are known to have subsequent detrimental effects on TBI outcome (i.e. hypoxemia, increased ICP, poor cerebral perfusion) [4\u201311].

This retrospective matched pair analysis of polytraumatized patients with TBI did not find a negative impact of concomitant pulmonary contusions and impaired paO2/FiO2-ratio on morbidity or mortality [8]. Considering that other conditions harmful to neurologic recovery, such as arterial hypotension, coagulopathy, hypovolemia and anemia are common in patients with multiple trauma, the additional impact of impaired paO2/FiO2-ratio on overall outcome may be limited. However, the study may have been underpowered (n = 180) to detect statistically significant differences.",

To allow for adequate risk stratification of patients with TBI presenting with a relevant mechanism of injury, yet without clinical signs of thoracic injuries at hospital admission, a chest CT scan may be warranted to assess the presence and severity of additional undetected thoracic injuries. This is of particular importance in elderly patients, who are at an increased risk for TBI. In the elderly, TBI is most commonly sustained from low energy mechanisms, such as falls [12, 13]. In this context, however, CT imaging of the chest may not necessarily be part of the workup of every patient with presumed isolated TBI. However, thoracic trauma is common in the elderly and minor injuries may be missed without CT, as they may present with normal clinical exam and chest x-ray findings [14, 15]. Without the recognition of the harmful effects of concomitant minor chest trauma, risk stratification and appropriate patient disposition is not possible. Furthermore, secondary hits on cerebral metabolism, such as hypoxemia, hypercarbia, significant anemia, poor cerebral perfusion must be avoided. In non-intubated patients, early use of non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen may provide suitable treatment options to improve pulmonary function and gas exchange. Adequate analgesia is of particular importance in thoracic trauma to improve respiratory mechanics and autonomous mobilisation of bronchial secretions. Early treatment (e.g. chest drain) of posttraumatic pleural pathologies may be helpful to decrease the risk for respiratory impairment. Furthermore, maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion (i.e. early vasopressor therapy and volume replacement) and normoglycemia are helpful to avoid secondary neurologic insults. This may be difficult in patients with hemorrhage from additional injuries, as blood pressure levels required for adequate cerebral perfusion may increase blood loss from uncontrolled bleeding sites. As even brief episodes of hypotension may have significant impact on TBI mortality and functional outcome, the risk and benefits of adequate cerebral perfusion must be carefully weighed [9].",

As we are restricted to the recorded items of the registry data set, not all information of interest (e.g. incidence/severity of hypoxemia or hypercarbia, cerebral perfusion and ICP values) is available. Although we are able to demonstrate that chest trauma is associated with worse outcome after TBI, we can merely speculate on causative mechanisms. In case of severe chest trauma (AISThorax = 4\u20135), laboratory values at hospital admission and transfusion requirements may indicate higher rates of hemorrhage, coagulopathy and shock. This would certainly be expected to negatively influence TBI outcome. For less severe thoracic injuries (AISThorax = 2\u20133), however, we could not deduce a specific potential causative mechanism from the available data. Chest trauma is related to several determinants of TBI outcome, yet, based on the dataset of the TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae further differentiation of particular effects is not possible. Apart from compromising respiratory function, the presence of chest trauma inevitably increases overall injury severity and thereby contributes to posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response, which is known to exert negative effects on outcome after TBI [16]. However, as details on ventilation strategies, gas exchange or inflammatory markers are missing from the registry\u2019s dataset, the extent and interaction of these effects remain unclear. The evaluation of the neurological function of survivors by the GOS is limited to 4 major categories. As the spectrum of disability within the categories is relatively broad and the classification of patient status may be biased by subjective interpretation of treating physicians, a more objective and detailed assessment of neurologic function at hospital discharge would be desirable. Good neurologic recovery was defined as a GOS score of 5. Compared to other GOS scores (i.e. GOS 2\u20134), we considered a GOS of 5 to be a relatively unambiguous description of neurologic function. Furthermore, optimizing the chance for good neurologic recovery is the main goal of TBI therapy.",
