Similarly, a review of stigma and help-seeking found that health professionals were more likely to report the experience of stigma as a barrier to help seeking when compared to other professionals [15] and among psychiatrists, is the most commonly cited reason for choosing to not disclose personal mental health concerns [16].",

Self-stigma involves the attitudes and perceptions a person with a condition may hold about themselves, whilst structural stigma refers to limitations (real or perceived) placed on persons with mental illness as a result of intentional or unintentional societal level policies and practices of organisations or institutions [20\u201322].",

            "text": "Within these types of stigma, MHPs may experience unique aspects that prevent or delay help-seeking behaviours [6, 23]. Harris et al. [23] suggest a culture of nondisclosure exists within the mental health profession, and that this non-disclosure works to increase stigma among MHPs. Registration requirements concerning professional impairment and mandatory reporting may contribute to this culture of non-disclosure within the professions [6, 24]. Di Benedetto [25] suggests that implicit in legal and ethical mandates for the mental health profession is the faulty notion that MHPs should be immune to mental health problems. Fears of career and organisational repercussions from disclosing difficulties, negative views from and toward colleagues experiencing difficulties, and the view that as health professionals one should be able to manage such difficulties without external intervention are reported to perpetuate stigma within the field [26]. These concerns map directly to issues of public, personal, self, and structural stigma within the MHP field, and suggest there are unique aspects to the experience of stigma within this population. However, to date stigma has primarily been measured using general stigma scales.",

Current instruments are inadequate to capture this phenomenon largely due to the broad label of mental illness and the focus of most measures on only one type of stigma. Furthermore, these measures are often focused on how MHPs might stigmatise their patients, rather than focusing within the profession [27]. To improve help-seeking in this population, there is a need to understand the effects and interrelationships of these types of stigma together, in particular the effects of structural stigma which is often omitted in scales of stigma for MHPs [28\u201330]. The Stigma of Occupational Stress Scale for Doctors (SOSS-D) does measure these attitudinal barriers to help-seeking and has demonstrated strong psychometric properties and structural validity [26]. However, the SOSS-D only targets three of the four facets of stigma (perceived other stigma, perceived structural stigma, and personal stigma) and was developed for use only among medical practitioners. Although there is overlap between the occupational groupings, the differences in training, job roles, and professional culture between medical and the broader MHP populations suggests the need for a measure specifically for use among MHPs.",

As a newly developed measure, no predictions were made as to the factor structure of the Mental Health Professionals Stigma Scale (MHPSS) and its internal consistency or test\u2013retest reliability. Rather, these were analysed in an exploratory manner and interpreted with reference to established guidelines. It was predicted that the Mental Health Professionals Stigma Scale (MHPSS) and underlying stigma constructs would exhibit convergent validity through moderate to high positive correlations with similar stigma measures and divergent validity through weak correlations with psychological distress.",

On average participants spent 20.72 h per week (SD = 11.97; MIN = 0, MAX = 45) in direct client care. There were 49 (26.9%) psychologists, 11 (6.0%) occupational therapists, 23 (12.6%) social workers, 13 (7.1%) General Practitioners, 7 (3.8%) psychiatrists, 29 (15.9%) nurses or mental health nurses, 25 (13.7%) counsellors, and 25 (13.7%) other MHPs (not listed, e.g. school guidance counsellors, provisionally registered psychologists, youth workers, aboriginal mental health workers, and consumer consultants/partners in recovery) who participated in the study. Participants worked in public (N = 78; 43.6%), private (N = 54; 30.2%), or non-government organisation (N = 47; 26.3%) sectors.",

Two mental health experts reviewed these items, and selected four of the ten items as being relevant, as well as suggesting an additional two self-stigma items. The modified scale was provided to a panel of current mental health professionals, comprised of seven professionals with backgrounds in clinical psychology, social work, occupational therapy, and mental health nursing.

Internal consistency of the total MHPSS scale was good, with three of the four subscales (perceived structural stigma, self-stigma, and perceived other stigma) also exhibiting acceptable to good internal consistency. The personal stigma subscale was below the conventionally accepted threshold for internal consistency, suggesting the need for caution in interpretation of this subscale. One explanation for this finding is that this subscale may have been particularly susceptible to social desirability effects. Future research should include a measure of social desirability. Test\u2013retest reliability was however found to be excellent across all subscales and the total scale.",

Partial support for this hypothesis was found. A significant moderate positive correlation was found between the OMSHC, a measure of stigmatising attitudes and behaviours in health care professionals, and the MHPSS total scale, Personal, and Self Stigma subscales. Although the Perceived Other and Perceived Structural subscales showed weaker correlations, these were still in the expected direction and logical given the OMSHC does not contain items corresponding to these constructs [32]. The PDD, which measured the extent to which respondents believe most other people hold stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental illness, had a significant weak positive relationship with the MHPSS total scale. A weak but significant correlation was also found between the PDD and the Perceived Other Subscale of the MHPSS, with other subscales demonstrating very weak relationships. Although the relationships were weaker than expected, the pattern provides support for the convergent validity of the MHPSS, in particular with the Perceived Other Stigma subscale and PDD measuring similar constructs. The weaker strength may be accounted for by the PDD being developed on a general population sample and also referring to the broader \u201cmental illness\u201d term rather than stress and burnout specifically. As such, although the convergent validity relationships were weaker than expected, the pattern provides confidence that the MHPSS is measuring the intended concepts.",

However, it should also be noted that despite the large proportion of females in this sample, this does not necessarily indicate that the sample was biased with respect to the general population of MHPs. In the Australian context these fields are largely female dominated. According to 2019 registrations with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), females comprised 80% of the psychologist workforce, 88% of the nursing workforce, and 91% of the occupational therapy workforce.

In assessing for stigma among this population, we have not provided guidance for users of the MHPSS on cutoffs or score bands to indicate problematic levels of stigmatised beliefs. Similar to conceptualisations of the broader barriers to care concept (e.g., [43]), we expect that stigmatised beliefs will likely have a cumulative effect, with greater endorsement of stigmatised beliefs being associated with reduced likelihood of disclosure or help-seeking. However, it is also possible that endorsement of a single stigmatised belief (for example, relating to potential discrimination in the workplace), when of significant distress may be sufficient to preventing help-seeking. As such, use of the scale may provide insight into overall patterns of beliefs and relative endorsement of stigma, although clinical attention should also be paid to the relationship each belief has with help-seeking for the individual. To this end, the scale may be useful in assessing macro level patterns of stigma in populations and workplaces, as well as understanding an individual\u2019s potential barriers to treatment seeking. Tailored individual and group level interventions may then be developed to target salient stigmatised beliefs and challenge potential cultural issues within professions and workplaces. We believe that the MHPSS may be a valuable tool to contribute to the emerging empirical knowledge base on stigmatising attitudes and perceptions of occupational stress and burnout among MHPs.",
