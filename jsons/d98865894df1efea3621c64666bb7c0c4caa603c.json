However, asymptomatic individuals can still actively shed the virus, transmitting disease. 6 Further, the incubation period of the illness, following exposure to the virus can range upward of 24 days, 8 leading to prolonged periods of viral shedding. These cases support the rational for prolonged school closures and cancellation of public events and social gatherings in efforts to reduce the continued spread of the virus among asymptomatic or mild cases.",

The first two human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were identified in 1960s and are well-known causes of the common cold. 3 SARS-CoV-2 infection has unique features that offer clues to its underlying biology. The Chinese reports indicate that children are significantly less affected by COVID-19, and when children do develop symptoms, they include fever and dry cough that rarely advance to severe disease. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 2143 children (aged 0-18 years) with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19; one death was reported in this group. 4 The most common symptoms are fever (65%) and cough (45%). 5 Up to one-third of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed-positive pediatric patients remain completely asymptomatic. 6 However, 6% of all pediatric patients with COVID-19 developed severe/critical illness, with upwards of 11% of infants under the age of 1 year developing severe/critical disease. 4 Interestingly, the radiographic changes that are characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection can also be seen in pediatric patients, even without progress to severe disease. Case series of pediatric patients in various regions of China reported that nearly 50% to 80% of the children had abnormal computed tomography (CT) findings, often displaying ground-glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. [6] [7] [8] Interestingly, one pediatric case series reported the chest CT findings of consolidation with a surrounding halo, suggesting parenchymal infection were seen in 50% of pediatric patients, a finding not previously Immunosenescence, the progressive decline in immune function with increasing age, is a possible explanation. Pediatric patients appear to maintain normal white blood cell counts and lymphocyte counts, 7 while adults often develop abnormalities in neutrophil counts and T-cell depletion. 10 However, the mechanism for this discrepancy is unclear.",

As there is homology in the sequence of the receptor-binding domain for the two viruses, it is felt ACE2 receptor is also the site of entry for SARS-CoV-2. 11 As these ACE2 receptors are upregulated in individuals with COPD, hypertension, or smoking history, this may explain why these populations are at increased risk for more severe disease. 8, 12 As pediatric pulmonologists, we are on high alert for our most vulnerable patients with underlying lung disease. Although the overall pediatric numbers are low, rare lung disease in children may not fall into these categories. Cystic fibrosis (CF), for example, is rare in the Chinese population, so how both pediatric and adult CF patients fare with COVID-19 is yet to be seen. In the meantime, we should proceed with caution; optimizing treatments for underlying lung disease seems prudent. Furthermore, minimizing cough related to asthma could reduce the potential aerosolization of the virus in an otherwise asymptomatic carrier. In that same vein, choosing hydrofluoroalkane-inhaler administered medications over nebulizers will also help reduce the aerosolized virus.",

These authors suggested that this finding, coupled with a higher procalcitonin level in SARS-CoV-2infected pediatric patients suggests a higher likelihood of coinfection in pediatric patients. 9 This highlights another key difference in clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatric patients as compared to adults and warns clinicians to monitor for signs of bacterial superinfection or coinfection with influenza or other viruses, and conversely to not rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of a positive flu swab. Importantly, pediatric patients provide an opportunity to gain critical insight into disease pathogenesis and guide future vaccine or therapeutic development. Two main theories explaining the protective effect of age are currently being perused: (a) differences in pediatric immune responses as compared to adults, or (b) differences in airway epithelial cell make-up affecting the availability of viral binding sites.",
