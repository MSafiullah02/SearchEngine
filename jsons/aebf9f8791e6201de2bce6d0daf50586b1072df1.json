            "text": "Shrimp aquaculture has grown rapidly over several decades to become a major global industry that serves the increasing consumer demand for seafood and has contributed significantly to socio-economic development in many poor coastal communities. However, the ecological disturbances and changes in patterns of trade associated with the development of shrimp farming have presented many of the pre-conditions for the emergence and spread of disease. Shrimp are displaced from their natural environments, provided artificial or alternative feeds, stocked in high density, exposed to stress through changes in water quality and are transported nationally and internationally, either live or as frozen product. These practices have provided opportunities for increased pathogenicity of existing infections, exposure to new pathogens, and the rapid transmission and transboundary spread of disease. Not surprisingly, a succession of new viral diseases has devastated the production and livelihoods of farmers and their sustaining communities. This review examines the major viral pathogens of farmed shrimp, the likely reasons for their emergence and spread, and the consequences for the structure and operation of the shrimp farming industry. In addition, this review discusses the health management strategies that have been introduced to combat the major pathogens and the reasons that disease continues to have an impact, particularly on poor, small-holder farmers in Asia.",

            "text": "Over the past three decades, shrimp farming in Asia has expanded rapidly from a very low base of traditional, low-density polyculture to become a vibrant export industry currently valued at more than $US8 billion (FAO 2006) . Industry growth, fuelled by commercial investment, government support and expanding global commodity markets, has been a major contributor to socio-economic development in Asia, particularly in poor coastal communities. However, the rapid expansion of the industry has also been a source of significant environmental and sociological disturbances associated with changes in land use, the ecology of aquatic species and patterns of global trade. Not surprisingly, a major consequence of these disturbances has been the emergence and spread of disease. Commencing in the late 1980s, a succession of previously unknown diseases emerged in farmed shrimp, in both Asia and the Americas, and spread rapidly across international boundaries to impact very significantly on production (Fig. 1 ). Since 1994, it has been estimated that annual losses globally as a result of disease, primarily caused by viral pathogens, have been as high as $US3 billion (Lundin 1995; Lightner 2003) . Although there has been a marked recovery in recent years, disease remains a major concern for the sustainability and profitability of the industry. This review will discuss the nature of these viral pathogens, the likely reasons for their emergence and spread, and the consequences of pandemic disease, both good and bad, for the structure and operation of the shrimp farming industry. The review will also discuss health management strategies that have been introduced to combat the major pathogens and the reasons that disease continues to have an impact, particularly on poor, small-holder farmers in Asia.",

            "text": "White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is by far the most devastating pathogen of farmed shrimp. It infects all cultured penaeids and has been responsible for much of the economic impact of disease on production globally. White spot disease (WSD) was first reported in June 1992 in cultured kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus Bate, 1888) in the Fujian Province of China and in nearby Taiwan (Zhan et al. 1998; Jiang 2001) . The disease spread rapidly north and south along the coast of China, affecting each of the major production species (P. japonicus, Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798 and Penaeus chinensis Osbeck, 1765). From March 1993, outbreaks were reported in several prefectures in Japan, commencing in farms that had imported P. japonicus juveniles from China (Nakano et al. 1994) . The disease also first appeared in Korea in 1993 (Park et al. 1998) and by 1994 had spread to most shrimp-farming countries throughout South and South-East Asia. The first recorded outbreak of WSSV in the Americas was at a farm in Texas in November 1995. A nearby processing plant that imported frozen shrimp from Asia was considered to be the likely source . 1998, WSSV was detected in wild shrimp stocks in South Carolina and in bait prawns in Texas. The major epizootic of WSD in the Americas commenced in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala in mid-January 1999. Subsequently, the disease was reported in Panama in March, Ecuador in May and had reached Peru by October 1999 (Alday de Graindorge 2000) . It is now enzootic in all shrimp-farming regions throughout much of Central and South America. The original source of emergence of WSSV in East Asia is not known, but it does not appear to be a natural shrimp pathogen and may have been introduced to shrimp broodstock via an unusual source of live or frozen feed.",

White spot syndrome virus infects cells of ectodermal and mesodermal origin and the most characteristic histological lesion is the appearance of eosinophilic Cowdry A-type inclusions in hypertrophied nuclei with marginated chromatin that become lightly basophilic late in infection (Wongteerasupaya et al. 1995b; Chang et al. 1996) .

It is distantly related to other large DNA viruses and has been classified taxonomically as the only member of the genus Whispovirus in the newly formed family Nimaviridae . Virions comprise at least 45 structural proteins that are arranged in three morphologically distinct layers (Tsai et al. 2004; Li et al. 2007) . The nucleocapsid, a helical, bacilliform structure (70 nm \u00b7 300 nm) containing the circular, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome and nine proteins, lies at the core of the virions. The nucleocapsid proteins include a basic DNA-binding protein (VP15) and a giant protein (VP664), which forms the stacked ring subunits and appears to protrude through the overlaying tegument (Leu et al. 2005; Witteveldt et al. 2005) . The tegument layer is loosely associated with both the nucleocapsids and the envelope and is composed of at least four structural proteins including the major capsid protein VP26 and the minor proteins VP36A, VP39A and VP95 (Tsai et al. 2006; Xie et al. 2006) . The envelope, which forms the 6-7-nm-thick outer layer, comprises a tri-laminar lipid membrane and at least 28 viral proteins, many of which contain transmembrane domains. The major envelope proteins VP19 and VP28, which protrude from the outer surface of the membrane, have been shown to induce a protective response in shrimp (Witteveldt et al. 2004a,b) .",

Significant variations in genome size have been reported between different isolates, primarily as a result of large sequence deletions (up to 13 kb) in the region between the DNA polymerase and the protein kinase genes .

There is also evidence that different isolates vary significantly in virulence (Marks et al. 2005) and that passaging of WSSV in different hosts can alter both pathogenicity and the sequences of tandem repeat regions (Waikhom et al. 2006) . Nevertheless, the overall nucleotide sequence identity between isolates is >99% ) and variations do not appear to affect the performance of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests commonly used for WSSV detection (Kiatpathomchai et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "White spot syndrome virus has a very broad host range in decapod crustaceans. In marine shrimp, the virus occurs commonly as a low-level persistent infection in the absence of clinical signs, but rapid increases in viral load, precipitated by physiological stress, salinity change or lower temperatures, can lead to disease and mass mortalities in ponds (Peng et al. 1998; Vidal et al. 2001; Du et al. 2006; Granja et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2006) . There is evidence that WSSV replicates most efficiently at 23-28\u00b0C (Guan et al. 2003; Du et al. 2006; Granja et al. 2006; Reyes et al. 2007 ) and that high water temperatures prevent the onset of disease (Rahman et al. 2006) . The virus also survives for longer periods in seawater at lower temperatures (Momoyama et al. 1998 ) and seawater temperatures <30\u00b0C are conducive to higher prevalence of WSSV infection in wild shrimp populations Withyachumnarnkul et al. 2003) . All farmed marine shrimp species are susceptible to WSD. Other decapod crustaceans, although universally susceptible to infection, may not develop clinical signs (Jiravanichpaisal et al. 2001) . Indeed, some crab and crayfish species have been reported to carry very high viral loads in the absence of disease and may be important reservoirs, sustaining the virus in the natural environment and representing potential sources of infection in shrimp ponds. Other invertebrates, such as polychaetes, bivalves, rotifers, artemia, copepods and some insect larvae, as well as microalgae, can accumulate high levels of viable WSSV in the absence of demonstrated virus replication and may act as mechanical vectors of infection (Yan et al. 2004 (Yan et al. , 2007 Liu et al. 2007 ).",

Horizontal infection of shrimp and other crustaceans has been demonstrated experimentally by exposure to infected water or by ingestion of infected tissue (Chou et al. 1998; Kanchanap-hum et al. 1998; Supamattaya et al. 1998; Corbel et al. 2001; ). Ingestion appears to be the more effective means of transmission in shrimp . Vertical transmission from infected broodstock to early life stages appears to be a common source of infection. Although there is evidence of WSSV in the muscles and connective tissues of gonads, infection of sperm has not been reported. Oogonia and oocytes may be positive by histology or in situ hybridisation, but mature eggs are not (Lo et al. 1997; Mohan et al. 1997) . This suggests that the virus in developing oocytes does not survive maturation and that transovarial transmission is unlikely. Rather, WSSV appears to be transmitted transovum by surface contamination of the egg (Lo et al. 1997; . Both horizontal and vertical transmission of WSSV infection can occur in the absence of disease.",

From central Thailand, the disease spread to southern areas on the eastern and western coasts of the Gulf of Thailand, reaching the far south by February 1992 ). Yellow head disease or yellow head virus (YHV) has since been reported from many shrimp-farming countries in Asia, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Taiwan (Mohan et al. 1998; Wang & Chang 2000; WB, NACA, WWF, FAO 2001; Natividad et al. 2002) . There is also recent evidence of the presence of YHV in Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 and Penaeus stylirostris Stimpson, 1874 shrimp from the north-west coast of Mexico (de la Rosa-Velez et al. 2006) . Several yellow-head-like viruses have also been reported. Gill-associated virus (GAV) is a closely related virus that has been associated with a disease called mid-crop mortality syndrome (MCMS) in P. monodon shrimp in Australia (Spann et al. 1997; Munday & Owens 1998; Cowley et al. 1999; . Yellowhead-related viruses have also been reported in P. monodon from Thailand and in P. japonicus from Taiwan Soowannayan et al. 2003) . A survey of shrimp samples from Mozambique, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Australia has revealed that YHV is one of at least six genetic lineages (genotypes) of related viruses that occur commonly in farmed P. monodon throughout the Indo-Pacific region (Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008a) . However, only YHV (genotype one) has been detected in shrimp with typical signs of yellow head disease. Of the other genotypes, only GAV (genotype two) has been associated with any form of disease. The original source of YHV infection in Thai shrimp in 1990 has not been determined, but it has been suggested that it may have previously been responsible for similar serious epizootics in Indonesia, Malaysia, China and the Philippines and possibly for the crash of the P. monodon industry in Taiwan in 1986 (Lightner 1996b . The close genetic relationship of YHV to other genotypes in the YHV complex suggests that it is most likely a natural infection of wild penaeid or palemonid shrimp (Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008a) .",

The disease derives its name from the bleached or pale-yellow appearance of the cephalothorax, resulting from discolouration of the underlying hepatopancreas, but this condition is not always apparent Flegel et al. 1995) . Disease associated with GAV infection is far less severe, with mortalities developing more slowly and rarely reaching 100% and, although moribund shrimp commonly develop a reddish appearance, the pale discolouration typical of yellow head disease does not occur. Yellow head virus is also far more virulent that GAV (>10 6 -fold by LD 50 ) in experimental infections in P. monodon (Nusra Sittidilokratna and Peter Walker, unpublished data, 2007) . Yellow head virus infects tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin and causes severe necrosis, particularly in the lymphoid organ and gills, with prominent nuclear pyknosis and heterokaryosis and densely basophilic spherical cytoplasmic inclusions evident in histological sections Lu et al. 1995) . Similar histological lesions are seen in moribund shrimp infected with GAV. Yellow head virus and GAV replicate in the cytoplasm in which long filamentous pre-nucleocapsids are abundant, and virions bud into cytoplasmic vesicles in densely packed paracrystalline arrays for egress at the cytoplasmic membrane Chantanachookin et al. 1993; Spann et al. 1997) .",

The virus is distantly related to other large ssRNA viruses infecting vertebrates and fish, including the coronaviruses, toroviruses, arteriviruses and bafniviruses, and, together with GAV, YHV is currently classified as the species Gill-associated virus in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae, order Nidovirales Schultze et al. 2006) . A roni-like virus has also been described recently and associated with mortalities in the freshwater crab (Eriochier sinensis Milne-Edwards, 1854) in China, but its relationship to YHV has not yet been determined (Zhang & Bonami 2007) . The YHV virions contain three major structural proteins. The nucleocapsid contains the ssRNA genome and the nucleoprotein (p20), which encapsidates and protects the RNA. The envelope comprises a tri-laminar lipid membrane and two glycoproteins, gp116 and gp64, which penetrate the membrane to form the spike-like projections on the virion surface. Glycoprotein gp116 has been identified as the target for virus-neutralising antibodies in vitro and in vivo (Assavalapsakul et al. 2005; Sittidilokratna et al. 2009 ). There is evidence that suggests that gp116 may be preferentially suppressed in persistently infected shrimp that survive YHV infection (Chaivisuthangkura et al. 2008) . Glycoprotein gp116 must perform a critical function in viral infection, but the domain structure has not been defined and the role of gp64 is presently unexplored. There is also evidence that a small triple-membranespanning protein (gp22) is a very minor component of YHV virions (Nusra Sittidilokratna and Peter Walker, unpublished data, 2007) .",

ORF1b is expressed only as an extension of ORF1a as a result of a ribosomal frame-shift at a predicted pseudoknot structure in the overlap region (Sittidilokratna et al. 2002) . ORF1a encodes papain-like and cysteine-like proteases that are required for post-translational auto-processing of the large pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008) .

The overall nucleotide sequence identity between the YHV and GAV genomes is 79%, varying from 74% in ORF3 to 82% in ORF1b (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008 ). There is a similar level of sequence identity between YHV and each of the other four genotypes, but genotypes three and six are more closely related to GAV than genotypes four and five (Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008a ). Analysis of a short region in ORF1b has indicated that nucleotide sequence variation between isolates within a genotype is generally within 2-3%, except for genotype five, which is more diverse (Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008a) . The molecular basis of the differences in pathogenicity and virulence among the genotypes is not known. The level of diversity between the genotypes is sufficient to require careful design of PCR tests to ensure the required level of test specificity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have been described for the genotype-specific detection of YHV, detection and differentiation of YHV and GAV, and group-specific detection of each of the known genotypes in the YHV complex (Wongteerasupaya et al. 1997; Cowley et al. 2004; Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008b ). However, recent observations indicate that genetic recombination occurs with high frequency between some YHV genotypes in natural populations of shrimp, suggesting that genotype assignments and the association of genotype with virulence is not straightforward ).",

A yellow-headlike virus has also been reported in P. japonicus in Taiwan . There is evidence of natural and \u2044 or experimental YHV infection in wild penaeid and palemonid shrimp and krill (Acetes sp.) found within ponds or nearby canals (Flegel et al. 1997b; Longyant et al. 2006 ). However, the severity of disease varies, with some susceptible shrimp displaying mild signs and surviving up to 30 days after experimental infection (Longyant et al. 2005) . Freshwater palemonid shrimp (Machrobrachium spp.) appear to be resistant to infection, although a mild infection has been established experimentally in one species (Machrobrachium sintangese De Man, 1879) (Longyant et al. 2005) . A survey of 16 species of crabs collected from the vicinity of shrimp farms in Thailand detected no evidence of either natural infection or experimental susceptibility . Other genotypes in the YHV complex have been detected almost exclusively in P. monodon. The prevalence of GAV in wild and farmed populations of P. monodon in eastern Australia approaches 100% (Cowley et al. 2000b; Walker et al. 2001) . Penaeus merguiensis, P. japonicus and P. esculentus Haswell, 1879 are also susceptible to experimental GAV infection, but pathogenicity varies (Spann et al. 2000) . Although P. esculentus co-cultivated with P. monodon have been reported to be infected, there is no evidence that GAV infection occurs commonly in any species other than P. monodon. All other genotypes have been detected exclusively in P. monodon, but a survey of other potential hosts has not been conducted (Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008a) . The evidence to date suggests that penaeid shrimp are the natural hosts of YHV and other viruses in the YHV complex, and that low-level, persistent infections occur commonly in healthy P. monodon populations throughout the Indo-Pacific region.",

In shrimp that survive experimental challenge, the infection can persist for up to 30 days following recovery, and perhaps for life. Recent evidence suggests that preferential suppression of expression of envelope glycoprotein gp116 is associated with viral persistence (Chaivisuthangkura et al. 2008 ). There is no direct evidence that YHV is transmitted vertically. However, vertical transmission of GAV has been demonstrated experimentally . High levels of GAV infection have been detected in spermatophores, seminal fluid, vas deferens and mature ovarian tissue (Walker et al. 2001; . Infection can originate from either the male or female parent, and the virus is most likely to be transmitted transovum on the egg surface . The high prevalence of infection in healthy P. monodon postlarvae throughout the Indo-Pacific region suggests that viruses in the YHV complex are maintained in a cycle of low-level, life-long chronic infections by vertical transmission and persistence (Walker et al. 2001; Spann et al. 2003) . Virus amplification and associated disease outbreaks appear to occur as a result of physiological stress induced by poor water quality or other environmental factors (Flegel et al. 1997a; de la Vega et al. 2004 ). The much higher virulence of YHV compared with GAV and other genotypes (>10 6 -fold by LD 50 ) ensures that the threshold of infection required for disease is far more easily obtained (Nusra Sittidilokratna and Peter Walker, unpublished data, 2008) .",

It was originally attributed to the use of chemical fungicides in nearby banana plantations, but was subsequently shown to be of viral aetiology . By 1996, Taura syndrome virus (TSV) had spread to Peru and north-eastern Brazil, throughout the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Central America, and to Florida and Texas in the USA (Lightner 1996a) . It had also spread to P. vannamei breeding programs in Hawaii by 1994, but was subsequently eradicated Brock 1997) . The rapid spread of the virus has been attributed to international trade in postlarvae and broodstock. In 1998, TSV spread to Taiwan in P. vannamei broodstock imported from Central and South America (Tu et al. 1999; Yu & Song 2000) . By 2004, following the dramatic amplification of P. vannamei production, TSV had become endemic in most major shrimp-farming countries in East and South-East Asia, including China, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam (Sunarto et al. 2004; Van 2004; Nielsen et al. 2005; Do et al. 2006) . The impact of Taura syndrome on the shrimp-farming industry in the Americas was estimated to be $US1-2 billion up to 2001 (Lightner 2003) . The impact in Asia is yet to be systematically evaluated. The original source of TSV in Ecuador is unknown, but its apparent absence prior to 1992 and the radiant nature of its spread indicate that it is unlikely to be a natural infection of shrimp. Taura syndrome virus may well have crossed species from another invertebrate host in the farming environment.",

Acute, transition and chronic phases of TSV infection have been described (Hasson et al. 1999a) . Diseased shrimp in the acute phase typically display reddish colouration, particularly in the tail fan and pleopods, as a result of expansion of the red chromatophores. Individuals have soft shells and an empty gut and usually die during moulting. Surviving shrimp entering the transition (recovery) phase display irregularly shaped melanised lesions on the cephalothorax, tail and appendages as a result of haemocyte accumulation, but may otherwise appear and behave normally. During the acute phase, cumulative mortalities may be as high as 95% (Brock 1997) . Following moulting and recovery, shrimp enter the chronic phase in which they remain persistently infected in the absence of obvious clinical signs. Although there is evidence that TSV may be cleared from shrimp during the chronic phase, it may continue for at least 8-12 months, and possibly for life (Hasson et al. 1999b ). Taura syndrome virus infects tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin, particularly the cuticular epithelium, subcuticular connective tissue and striated muscle, haematopoietic tissue, the lymphoid organ and the antennal gland Hasson et al. 1999a,b) . The virus replicates in the cytoplasm, with evidence of TSV RNA in association with proliferating membranes and cytoplasmic vesicles (Srisuvan et al. 2006b ).",

            "text": "Taura syndrome virus is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense ssRNA virus with icosahedral architecture (31-32 nm diameter). It is similar to small insect viruses in the genus Cripavirus of the family Dicistroviridae (e.g. cricket paralysis virus, drosophila C virus) and is currently classified as an unassigned species (Taura syndrome virus) in this family (Christian et al. 2005) . The TSV virions comprise the RNA genome, three major capsid proteins, VP1 (55 kDa), VP2 (40 kDa) and VP3 (24 kDa), and a minor protein VP0 (58 kDa) (Bonami et al. 1997; Mari et al. 2002) . The functions of the individual capsid proteins are not yet known, but there is evidence that VP1 (also called CP2) binds to the laminin receptor \u2044 p40 protein, which is a common receptor for several arthropod-borne RNA viruses (Senapin & Phongdara 2006) . The 10 205 nt TSV RNA genome is polyadenylated and contains two long ORF flanked by long 5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 untranslated regions and a long (207 nt) intergenic region (Mari et al. 2002) . ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins, including protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase elements, and a domain that is homologous to IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) sequences of animals and some other viruses. ORF2 encodes a long polyprotein from which the capsid proteins are generated by proteolytic cleavage. Translation of ORF2 appears to be from a single genome-length messenger RNA (mRNA) and is mediated by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) at a predicted stem-loop structure in the long intergenic region (Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2001; Mari et al. 2002) . Genetic and antigenic variations have been reported among TSV isolates in the major capsid protein precursor encoded in ORF2. At least two distinct lineages of TSV have been identified in shrimp from the Americas and variations at a locus in VP1 have been attributed to the failure of a standard diagnostic monoclonal antibody to detect some isolates (Erickson et al. 2002 (Erickson et al. , 2005 Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2002) . Isolates from Asia also display variation in ORF2 sequences, but cluster separately from isolates from the Americas, possibly as two separate clades representing the early isolates from Taiwan and later isolates from Thailand, China, Myanmar and Korea (Chang et al. 2004; Nielsen et al. 2005; Do et al. 2006 ). This suggests that introductions of TSV to Asia from the Americas have occurred relatively infrequently and that the virus has been dispersed within Asia from locally established breeding facilities. A recent isolate from Belize may represent a third genetic lineage (Srisuvan et al. 2005; Lightner et al. 2007 ). There is also evidence of variations in virulence between TSV strains (Erickson et al. 2002 (Erickson et al. , 2005 and of adaptation to growth in other shrimp species (Erickson et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2004) .",

Exposure to chronically infected shrimp can result in TSV transmission in the absence of disease (Lotz et al. 2003) . Although considered likely to occur, vertical transmission of TSV has not been demonstrated experimentally (Lightner & Redman 1998a; Dhar et al. 2004 ). Mechanical transmission is also considered a likely mechanism for the local geographical spread of TSV infection between ponds or farms. Taura syndrome virus has been detected in the faeces of sea gulls collected from the edges of shrimp ponds during disease outbreaks (Garza et al. 1997) . There are also reports that salinity-tolerant water boatmen (Trichocorixa reticulata Guerin-Meneville, 1857) carry TSV within the gut and may act as mechanical vectors (Lightner 1996a; Brock 1997; Dhar et al. 2004) .",

Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) was subsequently detected in apparently healthy P. vannamei farmed in the same facility and shown not to cause mortalities or the clinical signs typical of IHHN (Bell & Lightner 1984) . However, subsequent investigations demonstrated that IHHNV could cause a condition described as 'runt deformity syndrome' (RDS) in P. vannamei in which affected shrimp display cuticular deformities and irregular and slow growth (Kalagayan et al. 1991) . Economic losses as a result of RDS in P. vannamei have been estimated to be 10-50% per crop (Lightner & Redman 1998b) . Runt deformity syndrome has also been reported in cultured P. monodon infected with IHHNV, but the aetiology was not established (Primavera & Quinitio 2000) and subsequent studies have indicated that IHHNV infection causes no disease in P. monodon and has little or no impact on either growth or fecundity (Chayaburakul et al. 2005; Withyachumnarnkul et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus is a small (22 nm), non-enveloped DNA virus with icosahedral symmetry (Bonami et al. 1990) . It is closely related to small DNA viruses infecting Aedes spp. mosquitoes and is currently classified as the tentative species Penaeus stylirostris densovirus in the genus Brevidensovirus of the family Parvoviridae (Tattersall et al. 2005) . Virions comprise four capsid proteins of 74, 47, 39 and 37.5 kDa and a 4.1 kb linear ssDNA genome that is primarily encapsidated in negative polarity (Bonami et al. 1990; Mari et al. 1993; Shike et al. 2000) . The genome organisation is similar to other brevidensoviruses, comprising three long ORF of which the left ORF encodes replication initiator motifs and helicase and NTP-binding domains of the major non-structural protein (NS-1). By analogy with other parvoviruses, the middle ORF may encode the N-terminal region of a second non-structural protein (NS-2) that is expressed through an alternative splicing mechanism. The right ORF appears to encode the capsid proteins (Shike et al. 2000; Dhar et al. 2007 ). Significant genetic variation between IHHNV sequences has been observed with differences of up to 15% over a large (2.9 kb) region of the genome. Penaeus stylirostris and P. vannamei isolates originating from the Americas and Hawaii between 1982 and 1997 have been shown to cluster tightly (>99.6% similarity) and share a high level of identity (99.8%) with a P. monodon isolate collected from the Philippines in 1996 (Tang & Lightner 2002) . A second genotype identified in P. monodon from Thailand and Taiwan shares 96.2% identity with the Philippine genotype (Tang et al. 2003a) . Two other genotypes have been identified in healthy P. monodon; one was detected in shrimp from Tanzania and the other in shrimp from Madagascar, Mauritius and Australia (Tang et al. 2003a; Krabsetsve et al. 2004 ). These genotypes share 90% identity and differ from the Asian genotypes by 8-14%. The African and Australian genotypes have been shown to be integrated into the host genomic DNA. They have not been associated with histological lesions typical of IHHNV infection and experimental transmission studies suggest that they are not infectious for P. monodon or P. vannamei . However, other parvoviruses are known to cause latent infections, sometimes involving genome integration, and may be re-activated by environmental factors or infection with unrelated DNA viruses (Tattersall et al. 2005; Geoffroy et al. 2006) . Further work is required to determine the relationship between the integrated and free forms of IHHNV and the potential for reactivation of the African and Australian genotypes (Flegel 2006) .",

Virions appear to contain several structural proteins, including a 106 kDa major capsid protein. The 7560 bp dsRNA genome contains two long ORF. ORF1 contains two 2A-like proteolytic cleavage sites and encodes the coat protein and a dsRNA-binding motif. ORF2 overlaps ORF1 and encodes the RdRp.

However, as P. vannamei and P. monodon are now commonly cultured in the same regions of Indonesia (Agus Sunarto, pers. comm., 2008) there remains a risk of adaptation to natural infection in P. monodon and associated disease. Infectious myonecrosis virus primarily infects skeletal muscle, but there is also evidence of infection in the lymphoid organs, hindgut and gills, and the virus has been detected in phagocytic cells within the hepatopancreas and heart . There is currently little other published information on the biology of IMNV infection. were laboratory reared in Mexico from postlarvae imported from Taiwan (Lightner & Redman 1981; Lightner et al. 1983b) . The virus was soon found to occur commonly in P. monodon populations from Taiwan, the Philippines and French Polynesia (Lightner et al. 1983b) and has subsequently been shown to be enzootic in P. monodon throughout its geographical range from east Africa and Madagascar in the west, through the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, South-East and East Asia, to Australia and islands of the South Pacific. It has also been reported in many countries to which P. monodon shrimp have been introduced, including West Africa, the Mediterranean, Tahiti, Hawaii, North and South America and the Caribbean (Lightner 1996b; OIE 2006) . No systematic study of MBV strains has been conducted, but there is anecdotal evidence for the existence of different types and it has recently been reported that PCR tests designed to detect isolates from East Asia and South-East Asia do not detect African strains (OIE 2006 (Lester et al. 1987; Doubrovsky et al. 1988; Spann & Lester 1996) , Penaeus indicus Milne-Edwards, 1837 from Vietnam (Hao et al. 1999) , Penaeus penicillatus Alock, 1905 from Taiwan (Chen et al. 1989a ) and P. indicus, Metapenaeus monoceros Fabricius, 1798 and Metapenaeus elegans De Man, 1907 from India (Vijayan et al. 1995; Manivannan et al. 2004 ). However, attempts to infect P. californiensis, P. stylirostris and P. japonicus by experimental exposure per os have not been successful (Lightner & Redman 1981; Fukuda et al. 1988 ) and observations of infection in species other than P. monodon have relied primarily on histology, electron microscopy and \u2044 or positive PCR reactions. A more detailed molecular analysis, together with bioassays, should be conducted to establish with more confidence the susceptible host range of MBV.",

There are varied reports of the effect of MBV on the survival of juvenile and adult stages. Although MBV was implicated in the collapse of the P. monodon culture industry in Taiwan in 1987 \u2044 1988 (Chen et al. 1989b; Lin 1989) and as the cause of mortalities in pond-reared juveniles in Indonesia and Malaysia in the mid-1980s (Nash et al. 1988) , concomitant bacterial, parasitic or viral infections are now thought to be the likely cause of disease (Lightner et al. 1987; Chen et al. 1989a) . Persistent infections in juvenile and adult stages occur commonly and appear to be tolerated without apparent signs of disease (Chen et al. 1989a; Fegan et al. 1991; Natividad & Lightner 1992b) . Environmental or other stress has been identified as a significant factor in disease associated with MBV (Lightner et al. 1983b; Chen et al. 1989a; Fegan et al. 1991; OIE 2006) . Co-infection with other viruses, such as HPV, IHHNV and WSSV, has also been reported to occur commonly (Manivannan et al. 2002; Chayaburakul et al. 2004; Oanh et al. 2005; Natividad et al. 2006) and multiple infections may result in retarded growth (Chayaburakul et al. 2004; Flegel et al. 2004) .",

Enveloped virions (325 nm \u00b7 75 nm) mature in the nucleus and contain nucleocapsids (250-300 \u00b7 45-70 nm) of similar shape, but with one conical and one blunt end (Lightner et al. 1983b; Mari et al. 1993; Vickers et al. 2000) . Naked nucleocapsids of similar dimensions are also detected in the cytoplasm and attached to the nuclear envelope, most likely in traverse from the plasma membrane following adsorption and endocytosis of the infecting virions (Johnson & Lightner 1988; Vickers et al. 2000) . In the late stages of infection, virions in the nucleus are observed within spherical inclusion bodies comprising a paracrystalline network of small polyhedrin subunits, each 20 nm in diameter (Lightner et al. 1983b; Mari et al. 1993 ). The spherical shape of these inclusion bodies is the origin of the alternative common name of MBV (i.e. spherical baculovirus), although by scanning electorn microscopy they appear polyhedral (Flegel 2006) . The 58 kDa polyhedron protein displays a high level of amino acid sequence identity with the polyhedron protein of Autographa californica MNPV (AcMNPV), the type species of the genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus (Chang et al. 1993; Lu et al. 1993; Mari et al. 1993 ). There are no published data available on the polypeptide composition of MBV virions or on the molecular characterisation of the viral DNA.",

All life stages, except eggs and nauplii, are susceptible to MBV infection. Infection occurs in the epithelial cells of the hepatopancreatic tubules and anterior midgut from which virus particles and inclusion bodies are released to enter the intestinal tract via the hepatopancreatic lumen (Lightner et al. 1983b; Johnson & Lightner 1988; Chen et al. 1989a) . As for other baculoviruses, faecal-oral transmission is the most likely route of infection, with polyhedron providing environmental protection of virus released in inclusion bodies. Monodon baculovirus can be transmitted from broodstock to progeny, but there is no evidence of transovarial transmission and the evidence indicates that infection occurs by faecal contamination of eggs during spawning (Chen et al. 1992; OIE 2006) . Good husbandry practices, including washing of fertilised eggs or nauplii with filtered seawater, formalin and iodophores, can be effective in breaking the transmission cycle (Chen et al. 1992) .",

However, there are many other examples of emerging viral diseases in humans, animals and plants, and there is now a growing understanding of the factors that cause disease emergence based on an appreciation of viruses as an integral part of the ecosystem (Morse 1993 (Morse , 1995 Brown 1997; Mayer 2000) .",

A virus must achieve efficient replication and progressive transmission of infection in an environment that is constantly changing because of individual differences in host genetics and the immune response of the host. These environmental variations are met by the virus by ongoing competitive selection of the most efficient mutants with suitable variant phenotypes, or through an inherent capacity for evasive behaviour (Holland 2006) . In this way, viruses achieve a dynamic equilibrium that sustains a natural ecological balance with their host(s). This equilibrium does not a priori require the induction of pathology or disease. Many viruses infecting humans, animals or plants do not normally cause disease. Indeed, the absence of pathology or mortality may provide the virus with a better opportunity for replication and efficient ongoing transmission.

            "text": "There are two fundamentally different mechanisms by which new infectious diseases may emerge as a result of ecological imbalance. The first involves viruses (or other micro-organisms) that have a natural association with a particular host, but do not normally cause disease. Through a shift in the natural ecological balance, a normally benign agent may become pathogenic in its natural host. Factors with the potential to cause such an imbalance include immunosuppression or reduced resistance to disease (induced by environmental stressors, chemicals, radiation or other infections), enhanced replication (induced by a shift in ambient temperature) or modified cell tropism (induced by a different route of exposure). The second mechanism involves a more dramatic change in viral ecology associated with cross-species transmission. This complex process, by which a virus establishes in a new host, comprises four stages: (i) contact between a pathogen and a new, potentially susceptible host; (ii) transmission to and replication of the pathogen in the new host; (iii) sustained transmission of the pathogen between individuals of the new host; and (iv) genetic adaptation of the pathogen to achieve a new ecological balance in the new host (Childs et al. 2007 ). In the case of zoonotic diseases (human diseases derived from animals), the process by which cross-species transmission occurs is termed 'spill-over' (Childs et al. 2007 ). This requires that a virus is capable of completing the replication cycle in the new host and will be critically dependent on the availability of a suitable molecular landscape, including receptors and replication co-factors provided by the new host cell. As the molecular landscape is most similar for closely related species, spill-over is most likely to occur between phylogenetically related organisms. As the process of adaptation to a new host is assisted by genetic variability in the virus through mutation and \u2044 or recombination, it is also more likely that RNA viruses and some small DNA viruses with a high intrinsic replication error frequency will be involved in cross-species transmission rather than large DNA viruses (Holland 1993) . These likely trends are confirmed by the recent history of disease emergence involving cross-species transmissions (Morse 1993) . ",

However, large-scale shrimp aquaculture also represents a change in human activity with the potential for very significant impacts on the environment and the ecology of pathogens. The displacement of shrimp from their natural offshore or estuarine environments to terrestrial, earthen ponds provides opportunities for exposure to pathogens that they may not naturally encounter. The use of artificial or alternative live feeds presents risks of inadvertent cross-species transmission of contaminating pathogens. The culture conditions can often be stressful, particularly when water quality is poor or variable, compromising the natural defences of the shrimp and their capacity to contain infection. High stocking densities facilitate rapid transmission of infection and disease . Aquaculture has also led to a large and rapidly growing trade in live aquatic animals and fresh or frozen shrimp product, providing ready pathways for the rapid transboundary spread of disease (Lightner 1996b; Renault 1996; Yoshimitsu 1996) . The emergence and spread of a growing array of shrimp diseases is a natural and predictable consequence of these practices.",

Each of these viral pathogens appears to have spread from a single focal origin in Asia or South America and had not been detected in farmed or wild shrimp prior to disease emergence.

However, reports of WSSV in crustaceans outside of shrimp-farming regions are rare and the virus has not been detected in surveys of crustaceans in Australia where there is no WSSV or WSD in farmed shrimp (East et al. 2004) . The apparent absence of widespread WSSV infection in wild decapod crustaceans prior to the emergence of WSD in 1992, despite their susceptibility, suggests that the original source was a non-decapod invertebrate from which the virus has 'crossed' and adapted to shrimp and other crustaceans. Alternatively, WSSV may have been introduced to shrimp from a decapod host that is relatively isolated from other susceptible species and in which disease does not occur. There is evidence of the rapid evolution of WSSV since its emergence in shrimp and some strains contain large deletions of the DNA sequence, indicating that these regions of the genome are non-essential for efficient replication and transmission in shrimp (Dieu et al. 2004; Marks et al. 2005) .

Like WSSV, YHV was not known prior to its appearance in Thailand in 1990 (Pasharawipas et al. 1997) . However, YHV has a far more limited susceptible host range than WSSV, primarily infecting penaeid and palemonid shrimp, and it is now known that YHV is only one of six closely related genotypes in the yellow head complex that occur commonly in healthy P. monodon throughout its natural distribution in Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific (Wijegoonawardane et al. 2008a) . Each of the other genotypes is either non-pathogenic or far less virulent that YHV and there is evidence that some genotypes cluster geographically, suggesting the evolution of separate lineages in geographical isolation prior to aquaculture-associated shrimp translocations. This suggests that P. monodon is very likely to be the natural host of other genotypes in this complex and may also be the natural host of YHV. If so, the explosive emergence of yellow head disease in Thailand in 1990 is perplexing. One possibility is that a mutation or other genetic process created a highly virulent strain in a formerly non-pathogenic virus. However, this would imply that non-virulent strains of the virulent YHV genotype should also continue to exist in P. monodon in Thailand and there has been no evidence of this to date. Another possibility is that yellow head disease has emerged in P. monodon as a result of cross-species transmission from another similar shrimp species, perhaps a metapenaeid, in which it does not cause disease. If so, the natural host may be an important reservoir of YHV infection and a continuing source of spill-over into farmed shrimp. Further investigation of the genetic basis of virulence and the susceptibility of other shrimp species may unravel the obscure origins of yellow head disease.",

There is also evidence of geographical clustering of IHHNV genotypes in Africa and Australia (Tang et al. 2003a; Krabsetsve et al. 2004 ). However, the history of disease emergence for IHHNV is also associated with cross-species transmission, in this case as a result of exposure to Western Hemisphere penaeid shrimp species (P. stylirostris and P. vannamei) in which it does cause disease. Other viruses, such as MBV, Mourilyan virus (MoV) and hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV), also appear to be natural infections of penaeid shrimp (Flegel 2006) , although there is some evidence that both HPV and IHHNV may have distant evolutionary origins in insects (Roekring et al. 2002) .

            "text": "Aquaculture practices provide abundant opportunities for the emergence and spread of disease and it is highly likely that new diseases will continue to emerge with significant impacts on production. The risk of future disease emergence is directly related to the opportunities created for shrimp to encounter new pathogens as the industry continues to expand and evolve. Live or frozen feeds, particularly those of crustacean or other invertebrate origin, present a particularly high risk of successful pathogen transfer because of the potentially high dose, the route of exposure and the higher likelihood of trans-species adaptation. Polyculture of shrimp with other aquatic species, particularly invertebrates, also presents a high risk of pathogen transfer. The risk of exposure to new pathogens from natural sources in the environment will increase as shrimp aquaculture expands into new locations. It is perhaps not surprising that three of the major pathogens (WSSV, YHV and TSV) first emerged in countries that were leaders in shrimp culture development. Although the source of IMNV remains obscure, it is also not surprising that this virus first appeared at a time that the shrimp culture industry in Brazil was in a phase of rapid expansion. Africa now looms as a new and exciting opportunity for aquaculture development, but it is also the site of rich biodiversity and has been the source of emergence and re-emergence of many important animal and human pathogens. The expansion of shrimp aquaculture into Africa may well provide opportunities for crossspecies transmission that will precipitate the emergence and spread of a new array of virulent shrimp pathogens.",

Climate change may also influence the locations and distribution of suitable farming sites, rendering some sites vulnerable to rising sea levels and severe weather, and placing other areas within the suitable climatic zone for efficient production. It could be argued that, for viruses such as WSSV, higher ambient water temperatures will reduce disease risks (Rahman et al. 2006) .

            "text": "The emergence and spread of disease in shrimp aquaculture has caused economic impacts on a scale rivalling that of many of the major emerging diseases of livestock and humans. It was estimated in 1996 that annual diseaserelated losses in shrimp farming globally were US$3000 million or 40% of the total production capacity of the industry (Israngkura & Sae-Hae 2002) . The most devastating impacts have followed the first emergence of each of the major pathogens, which was marked either by a pause in industry expansion or a dramatic drop in the level of production (Fig. 2) . In Taiwan in 1987 \u2044 1988, an epizootic attributed to MBV, but likely to have been a combination of disease and environmental degradation, saw a 70% fall in production and near-total collapse of the industry (Lightner 1996a) . It has been estimated that the combined economic losses as a result of IHHNV and TSV on wild and cultured shrimp fisheries in the Americas, from first emergence to 2001, totalled US$1.5-3.0 billion (Hasson et al. 1999a; Lightner 2003) In China in 1993, the emergence of WSSV resulted in an estimated production loss of US$420 million in a single season (Wei 2002) . In Thailand, annual production losses peaked at US$650 million in 1994, falling marginally to US$600 million in 1997 (Timothy Flegel, pers. comm., 1998) . Production losses of a similar magnitude have occurred in many shrimpfarming countries in Asia (Walker 2004; Bondad-Reantaso et al. 2005) and it has been estimated that the impact of WSSV throughout Asia in the first 10 years after its emergence in 1992 was of the order of US$4-6 billion (Lightner 2003) . In the Americas, the emergence of WSSV in 1999-2000 also saw a rapid decline in production with immediate losses estimated at more than US$1 billion. The industry in many countries has never fully recovered (Lightner 2003) .",

Arthur and Subasinghe (2002) noted that potential impacts of aquatic animal diseases on wild populations and biodiversity could include changes in predator and prey populations, changes in host abundance, reduction in intra-specific genetic variation, local exterpations and extinctions. However, despite the widespread occurrence of disease in shrimp ponds and evidence that major pathogens occur at relatively high prevalence in wild stocks, there is little available evidence that viral diseases have led to a decline in wild shrimp populations in Asia. This may be because of a combination of low population densities and the likely absence of extreme environment stressors that promote disease emergence in the farming system. It may also reflect a lack of objective data. Nevertheless, there is circumstantial evidence that IHHNV has impacted on populations of wild shrimp in the Americas, with P. stylirostris fisheries landings in the Gulf of Mexico falling to the lowest on record following the introduction of the virus in 1987 (Morales-Covarrubias et al. 1999) , and the risks of serious environmental consequences of known or newly emerging viral diseases should not be underestimated.",

Successive crop failures have led to the abandonment of affected ponds and the relocation of farming operations to new areas, compounding the problem of coastal zone and mangrove habitat degradation (Dierberg & Kiattisimkul 1996; Paez-Osuna 2001) . Abandoned ponds are rarely re-habilitated for farming and either remain idle or are converted to non-agricultural land uses, such as housing or manufacturing (Szuster 2006) . Crop failures in disease-prone coastal areas have also led to the development of low-salinity husbandry practices, resulting in the conversion of irrigated paddy fields and the expansion of shrimp farming into inland areas. There have been concerns that this practice could lead to soil salinization, water pollution and increased competition between agriculture and aquaculture for water resources (Miller et al. 1999; Pongnak 1999; Ali 2006) . In Thailand, such environmental concerns have led to a national ban of low-salinity shrimp farming in inland areas (Szuster 2006) .",

In 2004, it was estimated that 28 000 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) P. vannamei broodstock were exported from the hatcheries in Hawaii to Asia each month, translating to a possible 6 billion nauplii and 3 billion postlarve (Briggs et al. 2004) . In 2006, P. vannamei production in Asia reached 1.81 million tonnes or 64.8% of total farmed shrimp production (FAO 2008) . This may well represent the largest trans-continental relocation of a single species in the history of the planet. Although P. vannamei are now commonly recovered off the coast of several Asian countries, and concerns have been expressed about their impact on native habitats (Arthington & Bluhdorn 1996; Szuster 2006) , there has been little evidence to date of displacement of endemic species and the environmental consequences of this mass translocation remain uncertain.",

Subsequent attention to chemical residue testing and bans by importing countries has significantly reduced chemical use in shrimp-farming operations. Although disinfectants, such as iodophores and hypochlorite, can be used to inactivate viruses contaminating surfaces (Danner & Merrill 2006) , there are no commercially available prophylactics or treatments that have been shown to be effective against the major viral pathogens in infected shrimp.",

Strategies for health management in shrimp aquaculture are therefore based primarily on the principles of pathogen exclusion and the avoidance of environmental conditions that induce stress, stimulate viral replication or facilitate disease transmission. Effective Viral disease in shrimp aquaculture Reviews in Aquaculture (2009) 1, 125-154 \u00aa 2009 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd pathogen exclusion practises require attention to all points in the shrimp production cycle, from spawning to harvest, at which viruses may be encountered or recycled into the environment (Fegan & Clifford 2001) . For P. vannamei and P. stylirostris, the availability of SPF and SPR stock, bred in captivity under biosecure conditions, has provided a source of nauplii and postlarvae from which the major pathogens have been excluded (Lightner 2005) . However, for most farmed shrimp species, including P. monodon, SPF stock are not widely available and broodstock continue to be sourced from the wild. As many of the viral pathogens of concern are common in wild stocks, stringent viral screening of broodstock and \u2044 or seed is an essential pathogen exclusion practice. On-farm biosecurity includes pond preparation by drying and sunlight exposure to eliminate residual pathogens and aquatic crustaceans in soil, filtration and disinfection of pond water prior to stocking and prior to exchange during grow-out, careful monitoring and control of water quality, fencing to exclude potential carrier crustaceans, netting to exclude birds that may feed on and distribute moribund shrimp, physical separation of pond implements, and treatment of effluents to prevent discharge of contaminated pond water into the environment (Fegan & Clifford 2001; Vanpatten et al. 2004; Subasinghe 2005) . Monitoring of shrimp during grow-out for early signs of disease, such as lethargy, gill fouling, unusual swimming behaviour, feeding patterns or colouration, and regular histological examination for evidence of infection is also commonly used to varying degrees by farmers.",

'Better Management Practices' (BMP) have been developed by international teams of specialists in conjunction with industry and government. These BMP are based on published scientific information on the biology of infection, epidemiological studies to identify disease risk factors, empirical observations and successful industry practices, and provincial, national and international regulatory requirements (Subasinghe 2005; Mohan et al. 2008) . In alignment with the International Principles for Responsible Shrimp Farming (FAO, NACA, UNEP, WB, WWF 2006) , BMP are designed to support small producers to: (i) increase efficiency and productivity by reducing the risk of shrimp health problems; (ii) reduce or mitigate the impacts of farming on the environment; (iii) improve food safety and the quality of shrimp farm product; and (iv) improve the social benefits from shrimp farming and its social acceptability and sustainability (Mohan et al. 2008) . Better Management Practices have been developed to provide guidance at all stages of the production cycle from hatchery operation to pond bottom preparation and water management prior to stocking, seed selection and stocking, and post-stocking management of ponds (Subasinghe & Bondad-Reantaso 2006; ADB, ACIAR, AwF, BRR, DKP, FAO, GTZ, IFC, MMAF, NACA, WWF 2007). Better Management Practices are often voluntary practices, but can also be used as a basis for local regulations or certification programmes. A critical aspect of the introduction of BMP has been the role of farmer groups and their effective linkage to the public sector (Mohan et al. 2008) . The provision of science-based information to farmer groups through effective networking and communication is an important key to success (Corsin et al. 2007 ). The successful application of BMP in the shrimp-farming sector in Asia has led to the development of BMP for small-scale farming of other aquatic species.",

The increasing use of SPF P. vannamei broodstock as a source of seed has significantly improved seed quality for medium-large semi-intensive farms, but small-scale farmers continue to rely principally on seed obtained from wild spawners or other sources of non-SPF boodstock. Polymerase chain reaction screening of broodstock, nauplii and \u2044 or postlarvae prior to stocking to eliminate the major viral pathogens, such as WSSV, is therefore a critical requirement to reduce the risk of disease during grow-out Mushiake et al. 1999; Withyachumnarnkul 1999) . This has been facilitated by the commercial availability of an increasing number of PCR test kits and the proliferation of government and private PCR service laboratories in shrimp-farming regions. However, recent national proficiency testing surveys in India, Indonesia and Vietnam indicate that less than 50% of the participating laboratories were able to correctly identify standard positive and negative samples (Walker and Gudkovs, unpublished data, 2007) . This deficiency is being addressed through measures such as training and the implementation of national registration and accreditation programs for PCR service laboratories. A more widespread adoption of simple, inexpensive and rapid pond-side test formats may also prove to be a very useful adjunct to PCR screening by eliminating heavily infected postlarvae and providing small-scale farmers with more control over seed quality Patil et al. 2007) .",

The rapid spread of WSSV and TSV within countries and regions, and between hemispheres, has been attributed primarily to the movement of live broodstock and seed. Shrimp seed (nauplii and postlarvae) are commonly transported freely within countries and there is a prolific international and transcontinental trade in both wild-caught and domesticated shrimp broodstock. Each of the major viral infections of shrimp can occur as low-level persistent infections in apparently healthy stock. Although PCR screening can be an effective method of detection, the vast numbers of animals being moved daily, the inadequacy of international and internal quarantine inspection capabilities, illegal trading in unscreened stock and the substitution of unscreened stock for certified SPF stock all contribute to a very high ongoing risk of transboundary disease spread. The potential for rapid translocation was first realized during the explosive WSSV emergence in Asia between 1992 and 1994, and has been demonstrated most recently by the emergence and spread of IMNV since 2002. The transfer of TSV and IMNV to Asia from the Americas has been a direct consequence of the importation of large numbers of P. vannamei broodstock, not all of which have been 'SPF', and the subsequent use of pond-raised progeny in local breeding programs. This has occurred despite the knowledge and costly experience of previous pandemic disease spread.",

It was subsequently demonstrated that the injection of formalininactivated WSSV or recombinant WSSV envelope proteins (VP26, VP28, VP19, VP292 or VP466) can also induce protection against experimental challenge, with VP28 apparently providing the most potent protection (Namikoshi et al. 2004; Witteveldt et al. 2004a; Vaseeharen et al. 2006; Ha et al. 2008) . Protection can also be induced by oral delivery of formalin-inactivated virus (Bright Singh et al. 2005) or recombinant WSSV envelope proteins expressed from bacterial plasmids or baculovirus vectors (Witteveldt et al. 2004b; Ha et al. 2008) . The injection of DNA plasmids expressing envelope proteins VP28 and VP281 also induces protection, but DNA 'vaccines' expressing the nucleocapsid proteins VP15 or VP35 have failed to protect (Rout et al. 2007; Kumar et al. 2008) . Relative protection levels using WSSV envelope proteins delivered directly or expressed from DNA are usually in the order of 50-90%, but immunity is relatively short lived, with a reported duration of approximately 4-7 weeks depending on the formulation. The mechanism by which WSSV proteins induce protection in shrimp is not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that antiviral phagocytosis in shrimp may be controlled by a Rab GTPase that is upregulated in WSSV-resistant shrimp and forms a complex with b-actin, tropomycin and the WSSV envelope protein VP466 (Wu & Zhang 2007; Wu et al. 2008) . It has also been suggested that autophagy, a homeostatic mechanism by which cells digest and re-cycle macromolecules and organelles by lysosomal digestion, may be involved (Johnson et al. 2008) .",

It has been shown that RNAi is active in shrimp and that injection of dsRNA or short interfering (si)RNA homologous to viral mRNA can effectively block WSSV, TSV and YHV infection (Robalino et al. 2005; Yodmuang et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2007 ). Inhibition of viral infection can be complete when shrimp are challenged within 1 day of the dsRNA treatment by injection, but the long-term durability of the protective effect has not yet been adequately assessed. A non-specific anti-viral immunity has also been induced in shrimp by long dsRNA or siRNA, but targeting to specific viral sequences, particularly essential replication genes, is far more potent (Robalino et al. 2004; Westenberg et al. 2005) .",

For protein-based 'vaccines', the potency of oral delivery suggests that application in shrimp feed may be practicable, but there is a lack of published experimental evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The most obvious potential application of RNAi is in the therapeutic treatment of infected broodstock in hatcheries to generate virus-free progeny, either for farm production or domesticated breeding programs. The prolongation of anti-viral effects by microparticle delivery of stable DNA constructs expressing envelope proteins and \u2044 or hairpin RNA also requires further exploration.",

These include such measures as the identification of national authorities with the responsibility and competence to supervise the implementation of aquatic animal health measures, national lists of reportable diseases, national aquatic animal health committees with the responsibility for coordinating and advising governments on disease issues, national surveillance and disease reporting programs, national contingency programs for dealing with disease emergencies, competent national and regional diagnostic facilities and planned programs for building capability and capacity (Bondad-Reantaso et al. 2005) . National strategies should be simple, practical and achievable within available resource allocations, and should not only consider farm-level disease management, but also the control of transboundary pathogen movements, management of chemical use, food safety and compliance with regional and international agreements and standards.",

Commonly, shrimp ponds have proliferated in river estuaries in an unplanned and unstructured fashion without consideration of the need for appropriate water or land management. Water intake to ponds and effluent discharge are very often drawn from, and returned to, the same shared canal, and there is little cooperation in the event of disease outbreaks to avoid cross-contamination of ponds. White spot syndrome virus is endemic in wild crustaceans in many of these farming systems and, notwithstanding strict adherence to BMP, it is doubtful if reliable production will ever be achieved without substantial investment in infrastructure. As poor small-holder farmers lack the necessary resources, this will require significant investment by governments or corporate benefactors in the interest of poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability.",

Cooperation between industry and government and adherence to policies and practices that serve long-term sustainability and profitability rather than short-term gains will be essential if past disease emergence scenarios and immense socio-economic and environmental impacts are to be avoided in the future. The need for responsible behaviour applies particularly to the core problem of transboundary pathogen dispersal through irresponsible trade in live shrimp. This is a significant challenge as year-to-year profitability and survival are strong drivers of industry attitudes and lack of education and traditional beliefs are widespread in poor coastal communities. Achieving attitudinal change and compliance across this diverse trader sector, often operating beyond national jurisdictions, presents major challenges to policy makers and regulators. Nevertheless, attitudinal change can be achieved through effective communication and an increasing number of peak industry bodies and other farmer groups are engaging with government to assist policy formulation. Creating awareness of the importance of aquatic animal health management and its relevance to sustainable aquaculture development, aquatic animal trade and human food safety will greatly assist in achieving attitudinal changes in key stakeholders.",

Key aspects of the biology and epidemiology of infection are now known for most of the major pathogens and technological advances have enabled the production of SPF broodstock and provided sensitive detection tools that allow screening of seed to eliminate pathogens. Although new pathogens will almost certainly emerge as the industry continues to expand into new locations and responds to the challenges presented by global warming, we should now be far better prepared to limit impacts and contain the spread of disease. The primary constraints on the effective management of existing or future diseases lie in the will and capacity of governments and industry to respond with appropriate policies and practices and the necessary levels of investment in training and infrastructure development. International cooperation and productive alliances of governments, industry and the community will be required to underpin the goal of profitable and environmentally sustainable aquaculture development.",
