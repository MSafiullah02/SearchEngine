This pattern is in contrast to that observed for RSV and coronavirus infection, for which rates of symptomatic illness and hospitalization decrease markedly after 1 year of age [10, 11] . Thus, our findings support the assertion that HMPV, similar to influenza [12] , causes clinically significant disease not only during early childhood but also throughout later childhood. This observation is further supported by findings from another multicenter prospective population-based study of hospitalized children with pneumonia in which the incidence of HMPVassociated pneumonia was highest among children <5 years old but also remained prevalent in 5-to 9-and 10-to 17-year-old children [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 347, "end": 350, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 530, "end": 534, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 535, "end": 538, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 614, "end": 618, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In a retrospective cohort study at a US children's hospital, 90 (11.0%) of 815 hospitalized children with HMPV infection were aged 5 to 17 years [13] .

However, children with HMPV who presented to an ED were significantly more likely to have shortness of breath (17 [77%] of 22) or wheezing (16 [73%] of 22) as a presenting complaint than those who presented to an OPD (shortness of breath, 10 [31%] of 32, P < .001; wheezing, 11 [34%] of 32, P = .006]. Among all 464 patients who presented to an ED, those with HMPV infection were more likely to present with wheezing (16 [73%] of 22) or dyspnea (17 [77%] of 22) than those who tested HMPV negative (wheezing, 192 [43%] of 442, P = .01; dyspnea, 214 [48%] of 442, P < .01). In addition, children who presented to an ED were significantly more likely to have a discharge diagnosis of asthma (10 [45%] of 22) and less likely to be diagnosed with otitis media (1 [5%] of 22) than those who presented to an OPD (asthma, 3 [9%] of 32, P = .002; otitis media, 9 [28%] of 32, P = .028).
