Rapid pointof-care (POC) tests for infectious diseases can improve access to diagnosis and patient management, but the quality of these tests vary, quality of testing is often not assured and there are few mechanisms to capture test results for surveillance when the testing is so decentralised. A new generation of POC molecular tests that are highly sensitive and specific, robust and easy to use are now available for deployment in low resource settings. Decentralisation of testing outside of the laboratory can put tremendous stress on the healthcare system and presents challenges for training and quality assurance. A feature of many of these POC molecular devices is that they are equipped with data transmission capacities. In a digital age, it is possible to link data from diagnostic laboratories and POC test readers and devices to provide data on testing coverage, disease trends and timely information for early warning of infectious disease outbreaks to inform design or optimisation of disease control and elimination programmes. Data connectivity also allows control programmes to monitor the quality of tests and testing, and optimise supply chain management; thus, increasing the efficiency of healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes.",

Together with the 2010 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's call to End the Neglect of laboratories, this has provided a major milestone on a pathway to place diagnostics and laboratory services as important pillars of a healthcare system. 3, 4 Recent outbreaks of influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Ebola virus disease illustrate the importance of diagnostics in outbreak investigations.

Diagnostic testing is traditionally considered as a tool to rule in or rule out a condition or infection when clinical presentation in a patient is non-specific. For diseases such as HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, most infections are asymptomatic but can cause serious long-term consequences. Diagnostics are used to screen for infection so that treatment can be given to prevent the development of long-term complications and to interrupt the chain of transmission to sexual partners or to the fetus in the case of pregnant women. A test for the human papillomavirus helps to determine risk of disease progression to cervical cancer. For pathogens that have developed antibiotic resistance, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, diagnostic testing is used to determine antibiotic susceptibility to ensure treatment efficacy. For HIV patients, a CD4 test result is used to determine if the patient is eligible for antiretroviral treatment and, for those on treatment, a viral load assay is used to determine treatment compliance and drug efficacy. A test of cure is used to determine when treatment can be stopped ( Figure 1 ).",

Mass drug administration (MDA) is the main control strategy for many of these diseases, resulting in the need for highly sensitive tests to detect the few remaining cases in areas of low transmission intensity after multiple rounds of MDA. Highly specific tests are then needed to certify elimination and maintain post-elimination surveillance.

The beads are in solution, offering more sites for ligand binding compared to a solid phase support. Fluorescent intensities can yield quantitative results.

Antigen detection from urine or stool samples will require multistep specimen processing and/or purification or concentration before being put into the antigen-antibody reaction within the microfluidic channels. A recent publication showed that it is possible to use the power of smart phones to power a microfluidic immunoassay reaction by plugging the reaction chamber into a smart phone using a dongle. 22 Over 80 assays can be run before recharging is necessary. The results are interpreted and displayed on the phone and the data transmitted to a central database if required. A dual test to detect antibodies to HIV and syphilis has been designed on this platform and will have utility not only to improve access to prenatal screening but also to allow surveillance data for the dual elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis to be available in real time. 23 Nanosensor assays A growing number of promising diagnostic tools are based on nanotechnology. The application of nanomaterials to detect host or pathogen biomarkers has the potential to yield ultrasensitive assays. Quantum dots are fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles typically between 10 and 100 atoms in diameter and the technology has been applied to the development of ultrasensitive tests for HIV and other viral infections. 24 It is also possible to use these technologies to combine pathogen detection and speciation with genetic analysis, such as detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Hence, they can be used for high throughput screening of drug mutation targets. Quantum wires are being used in the development of a fully automated diagnostic test for malaria infection, speciation and drug resistance status in less than 20 minutes. 25 These nanosensors can ultimately be configured to a handheld PDA-type device or a thin plate about the size of a small business card containing a tiny nanowire sensor. Operationally, these tests are simple to use and give answers in less than 30 minutes. They can be used during a doctor's visit or at home by a patient, or early detection of bioterrorism in a community setting.

            "text": "Molecular assays offer superior diagnostic performance compared to the limit of detection of immunoassays. In the last two decades, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have become the 'gold' or reference standard to which the performance of other diagnostic tests is compared. Until recently, they have remained largely laboratory based and are expensive and inaccessible. A number of POC molecular assays, with or without amplification, are now on the horizon that may transform the delivery of health services. 26, 27 The first sample-in/answer-out real-time PCR platform that can be used wherever there is a source of electricity has been introduced for the diagnosis of TB and detection of rifampicin resistance. [28] [29] [30] The GeneXpert real-time PCR platform has a large menu of test targets; thus, allowing polyvalency to test for different pathogens. It requires minimal onsite expertise and provides a result in less than 2 hours. It has additional advantages of random access and remote quality control. However, the cartridges are expensive and not affordable or sustainable unless subsidised in most high burden countries. To maximise the impact of these novel technologies, it is critical that patient pathways be modified to take advantage of the speed to result and to find cost-efficient means of implementation compared to traditional laboratory testing. 31 Isothermal amplification platforms such as helicase dependent amplification (HDA), cross priming amplification (CPA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) assays can be engineered into POC NAATs as there is no requirement for sophisticated equipment to perform thermal cycling. The details of these technologies have been described elsewhere. 27, 32 POC NAATs based on these technologies have largely been applied to high burden diseases such as HIV and TB, but other technologies, such as LAMP, have been developed and evaluated for the diagnosis of VL and HAT. In the case of VL, the LAMP assay for Leishmania donovani is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of VL (using a blood sample), and for the diagnosis of post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) (using a skin biopsy). 33 Diagnosis of PKDL will be important for the elimination agenda since patients with this condition are an important source of infection. In the case of HAT, the LAMP assay was shown to have a sensitivity of 87.3% (95% CI 80.9 to 91.8%) and a specificity of 92.8% (95% CI 86.4 to 96.3%) compared to a PCR reference standard. 34 Advocacy and investments are needed to apply these technologies to the control and elimination of NTDs. 35 The promise of diagnostics in a digital age In a digital age, data from social media and POC diagnostics in communities can be used to provide early warning for infectious disease outbreaks, and timely information to inform disease control and elimination programmes. The iSense project, an EPSRC IRC funded project in Early Warning Sensing systems in Infectious Diseases, aims to create low-cost latent sensing systems to analyse self-reported symptoms on the web, including social networks and micro-blogging sites (Twitter) and searches (Bing, Google). iSense will develop a new generation of early warning sensing systems to identify outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases, such as flu, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and HIV, by linking self-reported symptoms on the web to a new sensor-enabled disease surveillance infrastructure for an early warning sensing system for infectious diseases (http://www.i-sense.org.uk/research).",

In addition, RDTs lack on-board quality control and are often used in remote areas where health workers receive minimal training. As a result, accuracy of RDTs performed in the field can be quite variable. This may adversely affect patient care and the accuracy of the data gathered for surveillance.",

Given the widespread adoption of smart phones in resource-limited settings, RDT readers using this technology have the potential to combine high-resolution test images with the computing capability required to run image analysis software and transmit data.
