They had been detected previously in faeces from a vervet monkey in 1958, but it was not until rotaviruses were recognised as a major cause of neonatal diarrhoea in calves in 1969 and children in 1973 that significant research into this pathogen in other species commenced (Bishop and Davidson, 1973, Malherbe and Strickla, 1967, Mebus et al., 1969). Initially referred to as a reovirus-like agent, the name rotavirus was later adopted from the Latin \u201crota\u201d (wheel), because of the wheel-like appearance of virions by electron microscopy (EM) (Fig. 1\n) (Flewett et al., 1974).",

Classification into P types was more complex and generally required either P type specific monoclonal antibodies or the generation of reassortant viruses with identical G serotype genes but distinct P type genes. Serotyping has been largely replaced by genotyping (Gentsch et al., 1992, Gouvea et al., 1990). The nucleotide sequence of the VP7 gene correlates closely with G serotype designations. As VP4 is the minor neutralisation antigen, it is difficult to raise P serotype specific antibodies, making P serotyping much more demanding. As a result, fewer P serotypes have been definitively characterised, and P genotyping has been much more commonly used in epidemiological studies. When known, the P serotype is denoted by a number, while the P genotype is denoted by a number within square brackets.",

The G5P[7] strain shares 10 of 11 gene segments with typical porcine rotavirus strains and none with typical equine rotavirus strains, supporting its porcine origin (Ghosh et al., 2012), while the unusual G3P[3] isolate from a foal in Argentina appears to be most closely related to a cluster of canine and feline rotaviruses (Mi\u00f1o et al., 2013). The other G3 and G14 strains show a high level of conservation across 8 of the 11 gene segments, falling into 4 different patterns. In contrast, the unique nature of the G13 strain is highlighted when its full genome is compared to those of other rotavirus strains from all species, with the only similarity being the VP6 genotype I6, which is shared with typical equine rotaviruses (Matthijnssens et al., 2012a).",

Clinical disease presents as reluctance to nurse, depression, diarrhoea, dehydration, pyrexia and recumbency and has been reported in foals from 3 days to 5 months of age (Conner and Darlington, 1980, Dickson et al., 1979, Kanitz, 1976, Strickland et al., 1982, Tzipori and Walker, 1978), with younger foals generally showing more severe signs of disease (Dwyer et al., 1990). The incubation period is generally short, with the onset of diarrhoea usually within 1\u20134 days of infection (Higgins et al., 1987, Imagawa et al., 1984a, Kanitz, 1976). Virus can be shed in faeces before the onset of diarrhoea, during the clinical phase of disease, which may persist for 1\u201312 days, and after resolution of diarrhoea (Conner and Darlington, 1980, Dickson et al., 1979, Dwyer et al., 1990, Higgins et al., 1987, Imagawa et al., 1984a, Strickland et al., 1982, Tzipori and Walker, 1978).

Enterocyte destruction results in desquamation of epithelial cells, shortening of the absorptive villi and a malabsorptive diarrhoea (Woode and Crouch, 1978). Other reported histological changes include oedema, mononuclear cell infiltration, vacuolation and the presence of viral particles in the epithelial cell cytoplasm (Conner and Darlington, 1980).",

Activation of the enteric nervous system also plays a role in the pathogenesis of rotavirus diarrhoea, as shown by the attenuation of diarrhoea in mice using drugs that block neurotransmitters, although the exact mechanism has not been determined (Lundgren et al., 2000).",

This is advantageous, as commercial assays developed for detection of rotaviruses in humans can also be used to detect equine rotaviruses.

The first two of these are monovalent, one using the G3AP[12] strain H-2, the other using the G3BP[12] strain HO-5, and have been commercially available since 1998 (Fort Dodge Animal Health, USA) and 2001 (Nisseiken Co., Ltd., Japan), respectively (Imagawa et al., 1998, Imagawa et al., 2005, Powell et al., 1997). The third vaccine is a trivalent vaccine that contains the equine rotavirus H-2 strain, the simian rotavirus G3P[2] strain SA11 and the bovine rotavirus G6P[1] strain NCDV Lincoln, and has been in use in Argentina since 1996 (Barrandeguy et al., 1998, Garaicoechea et al., 2011). All three vaccines have been shown to significantly increase concentrations of circulating serum neutralising antibodies in mares and foals (Barrandeguy et al., 1998, Imagawa et al., 2005, Powell et al., 1997). However, experimental infection studies and field studies have shown that foals can acquire rotavirus infection despite having substantial amounts of circulating antibody (Conner and Darlington, 1980, Higgins et al., 1987). Results from field vaccination studies have been equivocal, with some studies reporting a reduction in the incidence and severity of diarrhoea and the shedding of virus in faeces (Barrandeguy et al., 1998, Imagawa et al., 2005), while another study found no significant reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea (Powell et al., 1997). However, as foals from vaccinated mares in all of these studies were still affected by rotavirus diarrhoea, at best these vaccines can only be considered partially protective.",

This suggests that, while heterotypic immunity is possible with a monovalent vaccine, it is likely to be delayed in onset compared to homotypic immunity. Currently, there is a multivalent vaccine available that aims to induce heterotypic immunity, however, of all the G genotypes in group A rotaviruses, the two G types most prevalent in horses, G3 and G14, are also the most genetically similar (Browning et al., 1991d), which raises questions about the benefit of using a multivalent vaccine in horses. Furthermore, studies on vaccination of dams with monovalent inactivated rotavirus vaccines have shown that the response generated is typically pan-serotypic, generating neutralising antibodies against rotavirus serotypes that are unlikely to have infected the dam previously (Browning et al., 1991b, Snodgrass et al., 1991).",

Similarly, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as ammonium chloride, are also ineffective against rotaviruses (Springthorpe et al., 1986). The majority of phenolic compounds were ineffective in inactivating human rotaviruses in a study of the efficacy of commercial disinfectants. One product containing o-phenylphenol, o-benzyl-chlorophenol and p-tertiary-amyl phenol had a high rate of efficacy in the presence of high loads of organic matter, but only when tested on viral suspensions. This same product was not effective on a contaminated inanimate surface (Lloyd-Evans et al., 1986, Springthorpe et al., 1986).",

It is known that local mucosal immunity is more important than systemic immunity for protection against gastrointestinal viral diseases. While the current equine rotavirus vaccines stimulate high serum antibody levels, further investigation of the antibody levels in milk in vaccinated mares and the correlation between these and protection in foals is needed. If these studies revealed adequate IgA levels in milk, then research into other aspects of foal susceptibility needs to be conducted. These areas may include the use of quantitative PCR to investigate if there is a correlation between faecal pathogen load and development of clinical disease, and the effect of vaccination on faecal shedding by infected foals and their dams. The role of cell mediated immunity in foal susceptibility to rotaviruses also remains to be explored.",
