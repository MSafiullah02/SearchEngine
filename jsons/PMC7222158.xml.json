A long presymptomatic period of development is a characteristic feature of PD pathogenesis. Motor symptoms are manifested only after the loss of 50\u201360% of DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a 70\u201380% decrease in dopamine levels in the striatum (Cookson et al. 2008; Kalia and Lang 2015).",

In most cases, however, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD (Singleton et al. 2013). In this regard, the picture of the PD etiopathogenesis is not completely understood. Moreover, it is clear that, in addition to changes in the primary structure of DNA, changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Changes in the epigenetic pattern can be associated with the effect of environmental factors, the assessment of the action of which can be carried out via the study of individuals with a genetic background that is almost identical, including monozygotic twins discordant for PD.",

However, it is known that the all identified genes of the monogenic forms of this disease are not specific to nerve cells and are expressed in various cell types. Therefore, changes that occur during the development of this pathology in neurons can be observed in other types of cells. Skin fibroblasts are among the cells that are available for research. Currently, only one transcriptome study of skin biopsies obtained from 12 patients with PD has been reported. In that study, processes that are characteristic of PD were identified, including mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired protein metabolism. The degeneration observed in the central nervous system was concluded to be systemic and also manifests itself in peripheral tissues (Planken et al. 2017). Based on these findings, it can be concluded that homeostatic imbalance and stress can lead to increased susceptibility to external and internal factors in patients, which may be reflected in the functioning of peripheral tissues.",

The diagnosis of PD was based on the UK Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank criteria (Hughes et al. 1992). Patients were at stages 2\u20134 of the Hoehn\u2013Yahr scale and had a mixed form of PD. The disease duration was at least 7 years. The healthy siblings did not have any signs of PD at the time of collection of the biological material. The twins lived in the same area, and their work was not associated with dangerous factors, such as pesticides or heavy metals. There was no information about the presence of head injuries in their history. Sex, age, and stage of the disease are presented in Table 1.",

These processes, together with the process \u201cpositive regulation of fat cell differentiation,\u201d which had the highest statistical significance, formed a cluster of processes, cluster A. An enrichment analysis revealed that the process of differentiation of fat cells was located separately from the other two processes in the cluster (Table 3). However, Fig. 1 shows that these processes are related through the PTGS2 gene. In general, genes from the process \u201cpositive regulation of fat cell differentiation\u201d are involved in other processes (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is necessary to refer to various bioinformatics resources to obtain more complete information when conducting this type of research.",

Calcineurin is known to be Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, widely represented in neurons (Klee et al. 1979). NFATC2, one of the nuclear factors of activated T-cell (NFAT) family of transcription factors, is a target of calcineurin (Crabtree and Olson 2002). These proteins move to the nucleus and participate in the regulation of gene expression in most cases through other transcription factors, when NFAT proteins are dephosphorylated by calcineurin (Macian 2005). It is currently known that these proteins are involved in the regulation of neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and axon growth in addition to participating in the functioning of the immune system (Graef et al. 2003; Nguyen and Di Giovanni 2008; Schwartz et al. 2009). Besides, it was shown in transgenic mice that A53T mutant \u03b1-synuclein activates calcineurin and subsequent transfer of NFAT proteins to the nucleus in dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain. According to the authors, their data indicate the active involvement of calcineurin- and NFAT-mediated signaling pathways in the \u03b1-synuclein-mediated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD (Luo et al. 2014). Based on this hypothesis, we can conclude that the processes identified by us can be directly related to the development of PD.",

            "text": "COX-2, which is encoded by the PTGS2 gene, is expressed in response to various stimuli; in particular, it is induced in response to NMDA-associated synaptic activity (Yamagata et al. 1993). COX-2 is involved in the synthesis of several prostaglandins, each of which affects the survival and death of neurons in various ways. It was shown that the activation of COX-2 and subsequent synthesis of prostaglandins occur in a wide range of acute and chronic neurodegenerative pathologies and are associated with neuronal death (Wu et al. 2007). The dependence of COX-2 expression on the natural excitatory synaptic activity is confirmed by the presence of immunoreactivity of this protein in distal dendrites and dendritic spines, which are involved in synaptic signaling, and its exceptional localization in excitatory glutamatergic neurons (Kaufmann et al. 1997). It has been shown that the expression of this gene may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and PD (Minghetti 2004). An increase in COX-2 expression has been found in postmortem samples of DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra of patients with PD and in a mouse model that was generated using MPTP. As suggested by the authors, the involvement of increased COX-2 expression in neurodegeneration in PD can be confirmed by the fact that MPTP-induced neurodegeneration decreases in mice in which this gene has been knocked out (Teismann et al. 2003). Conversely, a decrease in COX-2 expression leads to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins, which are necessary for the normal functioning of the brain (Shewchuk 2014). COX-2 inhibition has been shown to lead to neuronal death via autophagy (Niranjan et al. 2018). Our expression analysis showed an 1.8\u20134.2-fold decrease (median = (from 0.27 to 0.64), Table 4) in the level of the PTGS2 transcript. This may indicate that this gene is involved in the neurodegenerative process in PD and that its downregulation may lead to neuronal death through autophagy.",

These receptors are involved in synaptic transmission and play a modulatory role in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition (Contractor et al. 2000; Swanson and Sakai 2009). The modulatory effect of kainate receptors occurs through several mechanisms that affect the presynaptic (Kullmann 2001; Lauri et al. 2001) and postsynaptic terminals (Castillo et al. 1997), the rhythmic activity of the neural network (Fisahn et al. 2004), the functioning of the astroglial network, and the neuron\u2013glia interaction (Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff 2007). It has been shown that parkin interacts and ubiquitinates GLUK2 and regulates the levels of this subunit. The expression of mutant parkin correlates with GLUK2 accumulation and excitotoxicity. The accumulation of GLUK2 was detected in postmortem brain samples of patients with PD, as well as in mice with a Q311X mutation in the Prkn gene (Maraschi et al. 2014). We also found a 2.9\u20135.8-fold increase in the expression of GRIK2 (median = (from 2.03 to 2.89), Table 4). This may affect the development of excitotoxicity and the subsequent degeneration of neurons in PD, which points to a possible role for GRIK2 in the pathogenesis of PD.",

In the absence of functional Nav1.7 channels, olfactory neurons continue to produce action potentials after being excited by odors but cannot initiate synaptic signaling (Weiss et al. 2011).

An RNA-seq analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of such twins was carried out. Twenty-nine DEGs in all three pairs of twins were identified in the analysis. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.",
