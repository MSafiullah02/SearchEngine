Nevertheless, with evolving resistance and emerging infections, the urgent need to fight such threats in a coordinated fashion at a local and societal level continues.

It is estimated to take approximately 2 days of technologist and director time to validate a new E-test or disk method with 30 to 40 strains\u2014that is, a discouraging barrier for bringing new AST tests on board. Importantly, laboratories also perform a mini-verification every time they perform a test by running quality control (QC) testing with confirmation that results are within specified limits (individualized QC plan, exceptions aside). Presumably QC requirements are deemed appropriately discriminatory for evaluation of ongoing assay performance, so why the initial extra verification step? Verification should be an issue for initial vetting by the manufacturer with appropriately large, representative strain sets, and test product deficits should not fall under the purview of postmarketing discovery by laboratories with greatly differing capabilities. If this seemingly redundant and purposefully vague verification requirement were lifted, the broad array of AST testing for new drugs could be implemented within days! Another option, although potentially burdensome and perhaps unnecessary, would be to task a set of high complexity clinical laboratories on a volunteer basis or possibly with some financial recompense to perform an independent assessment to verify manufacturer's claims that could be relied on by the field.",

Currently, microbiology laboratories independently construct and validate LDTs for similar sets of pathogens, given comparable clinical needs and the lack of commercial testing options. A free centralized publicly available database of pooled procedural and validation information would provide a much more comprehensive understanding of assay design and performance and allow laboratories to benefit from collective experience instead of each reinventing the wheel on its own. Best practice procedures including reagent and assay performance characteristics could then be described in consensus guidelines, which would ultimately increase the quality of overall diagnostic testing.",

To expand this idea further, the authors also propose a repository of free publicly available critical analytes that would allow standardization of LDT assays across facilities (eg, viral load standards) and ensure robust detection, for example, of critical viral subtypes in the face of genetic drift and emerging variants.",

Transplant and immunocompromised host infectious disease testing could also be extended to the range of sample types of importance (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and other respiratory specimens for molecular detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and toxoplasma among others).
