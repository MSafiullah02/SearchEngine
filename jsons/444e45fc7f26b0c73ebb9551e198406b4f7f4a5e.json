However, different challenges posed by coronavirus outbreak, have made its various aspects more noticeable to physicians working in different fields. One aspect that is the very focus of the present study, was the level of anxiety among the multiple sclerosis (MS) patients at the current situation. It is wellacknowledged that, anxiety is one of the leading causes of attacks among the MS patients and can also exacerbate this disease (2) . Hence, it is of great significance to as much as possible eliminate stressors from these patients' lives. The outbreak of coronavirus in Iran can be one of the causes of anxiety among these patients. So, to examine the above-mentioned hypothesis, the anxiety level of numbers of the MS patients was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (3) on a specific day, i.e. February 25, 2020. According to the mentioned questionnaire, the level of anxiety can be divided into four levels of none, low, moderate, and severe.",

The mean age of the patients, the mean duration of the disease, and the mean of expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were 33.48\u00b15.18 years old, 6.10\u00b14.18 years, and 1.24\u00b11.71, respectively (Table 1 ). The mean level of anxiety in terms of the Beck Anxiety Inventory was 25.72\u00b16.53 in these patients, which was within the range of moderate to severe based on the mentioned rating scale of this questionnaire. The level of anxiety was severe, moderate, and low or none in 15, 18, and none of the patients, respectively. There was no statistically significant correlation between the level of anxiety and patients' disease modifying drugs.",
