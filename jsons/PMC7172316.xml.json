            "text": "Complement is a major element of the innate immune response and also serves to link innate and adaptive immunity. It is an ancient immunological defence system that is thought to have evolved over 700 million years ago and components have been identified in all vertebrate classes (Zarkadis et al., 2001). Complement comprises over 30 serum and membrane-bound proteins which, when activated, form a cascade of reactions contributing to the elimination of invading microorganisms. Three pathways of activation exist, the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways (outlined in Fig. 1A\nand reviewed in Walport, 2001), all of which invoke several responses capable of controlling or eliminating infection. This overview will focus on the interaction of viruses with complement, highlighting the protective role of complement against viral infection, the mechanisms used by viruses to evade the effects of complement and the ways in which some viruses can exploit complement to enhance infection. It does not aim to provide a comprehensive analysis but rather an overview of the interaction between viruses and complement. Our intention is to emphasise the growing recognition of the importance of complement to virus biology, revealed through the increasing number of viruses known to have either active or passive (or both) strategies of complement regulating activity.",

            "text": "Complement activation can be potentially damaging to host cells and must therefore be tightly regulated. For this reason, activated components have very short half-lives and are regulated by a large family of host plasma and membrane-bound proteins that are involved in the physiological control of many stages of the complement cascade. Examples of mammalian complement control proteins are given in Table 1\n. Complement regulation is based upon three principle mechanisms: (i) accelerated dissociation of the enzymes that cleave C3 and C5, so-called convertase complexes, which mediate the cascade of complement activation; (ii) enzymatic cleavage to inactivate components; and (iii) inactivation following irreversible binding of inhibitors. Host proteins involved in regulating complement include C1 inhibitor, CD59, and a group of proteins known as regulators of complement activation (RCA) (reviewed in Morgan and Harris, 1999). RCA proteins contain structural motifs known as short consensus repeats (SCRs), with each SCR comprising 60\u201370 amino acids and a conserved motif of di-sulphide-linked cysteines and several hydrophobic residues. RCA proteins only regulate complement components C3b and C4b. Other resistance mechanisms adopted by nucleated cells include the expression of ecto-proteases on their surface that can inactivate complement components by cleavage. Nucleated mammalian cells can also avoid lysis by the terminal complement membrane attack complex (MAC; see below) through shedding or endocytosis of vesicles enriched in MAC components Carney et al., 1985, Carney et al., 1986, Scolding et al., 1989.",

Phagocytic cells have surface receptors that recognise and bind to C1q, C3b and C4b, promoting uptake and destruction of virions covered with these components (reviewed in Hannan et al., 2002, Krych-Goldberg and Atkinson, 2001, McGreal and Gasque, 2002). Covalent attachment of C3b and C4b to the virion surface may also prevent viral interaction with receptors, uncoating and entry into host cells. Indeed, coating of several viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with C3 has been shown to functionally inactivate the virus in vitro and in vivo (Sullivan et al., 1998). Aggregation of viral particles due to the binding of multivalent complement components, such as C1q and antibodies, can neutralise virus infectivity and also promote phagocytosis via Fc receptors.",

They mediate many inflammatory responses including smooth muscle contraction, enhanced vascular permeability, release of vasoactive amines, and induction of lysosomal enzyme release.

C3dg (see Fig. 1B-II) combined with viral antigen can also induce cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor and CR2 on the B cell surface. Indeed, it has been shown that mice deficient in various complement components fail to develop normal memory responses to herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Da Costa et al., 1999). Furthermore, the antigenicity of the HIV envelope glycoproteins encoded by env (and other viral antigens) was augmented by creating a DNA vaccine for evaluation in mice, whereby env was fused to the human or murine genes encoding C3d (Green et al., 2001).",

Three \u03b3-herpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), and murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), encode proteins (KCP, CCPH, and MHV68-RCA, respectively) with homology to DAF and MCP, all of which inhibit complement activation Fodor et al., 1995, Kapadia et al., 1999, Spiller et al., 2003b. KSHV KCP comprises three protein isoforms that are thought to be produced by alternative splicing and they all regulate complement activation (Spiller et al., 2003b). KCP can prevent cell surface deposition of C3b, enhance the decay of the classical pathway C3 convertase, and act as a cofactor in a factor I-mediated cleavage reaction (see Fig. 1B-II; Mullick et al., 2003, Spiller et al., 2003a, Spiller et al., 2003b). The HVS CCPH protein shows similar activity to KCP, in that it inhibits C3b deposition and C3 convertase activity (Fodor et al., 1995). A second, distinct complement regulatory protein encoded by HVS, HVS15, is thought to control complement activity by blocking formation of the terminal MAC (Albrecht et al., 1992).",

Although the gC glycoproteins of HSV-1 and -2 are highly homologous to one another, they demonstrate significant differences in their ability to regulate complement. HSV-1 gC can accelerate the decay of the alternative pathway convertase and protects HSV-1 against the complement activities of this pathway (Hung et al., 1994). An HSV-1 gC mutant incapable of binding complement has been shown to have reduced pathogenicity in an animal model of infection (Lubinski et al., 1998). HSV-2 gC does not accelerate the decay of the alternative pathway convertase but does provide protection against complement-mediated neutralisation. However, compared to the HSV-1 gC protein, HSV-2 gC demonstrates poor complement regulatory activity. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) also has complement regulatory activity (Mold et al., 1988), but does not encode for any proteins showing homology to host complement regulatory proteins, highlighting that much remains to be understood about these viral proteins.",

            "text": "CR are expressed on many tissues and cells, including neutrophils, FDC, B cells, and macrophages. They have an important role in clearing immune complexes, as well as in neutrophil function. It is well established that EBV gains entry to B cells and endothelial cells through interactions between the viral gp350/220 proteins and complement receptor CR2 (Fingeroth et al., 1984), although other receptors, such as certain integrins, have also been shown to be involved (Tugizov et al., 2003). Kinetic studies have indicated that gp350/220 has higher affinity for CR2 than host C3 fragments and would effectively surpass host CR2\u2013C3dg binding (Moore et al., 1989). Complement regulators are also targets for viral binding. MCP has recently been identified as a receptor for group Badenoviruses, since non-permissive cells were rendered susceptible to viral infection by expression of MCP Gaggar et al., 2003, Segerman et al., 2003. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and measles virus (MV) both use MCP as a cellular receptor, although they utilise different domains of this receptor for binding (Greenstone et al., 2002). Identification of MCP as the receptor for MV has led to the development of a transgenic mouse model that has contributed to in vivo studies of viral pathogenesis Horvat et al., 1996, Rall et al., 1997. However, the primary MV receptor, signalling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM) (Tatsuo et al., 2000), is not part of the complement system. Nevertheless, the lack of SLAM in the central nervous system (CNS) suggests that utilisation of MCP by MV may determine the development of the severe CNS complications (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) sometimes associated with MV infections. Several other viruses, including many enteroviruses, such as echovirus 7 and certain coxsackie viruses, use DAF as a co-receptor Bergelson et al., 1994, Martino et al., 1998, Shafren, 1998, Spiller et al., 2000; binding may not be sufficient to enable viral entry, but rather serve to facilitate interactions with other accessory molecules, hence the use of the term co-receptor. Closely related picornaviruses that bind DAF have been shown to interact with different SCRs of the DAF protein (Powell et al., 1999).",

HIV either opsonised by complement or immunocomplexed (complement fragments plus antibody) can associate efficiently with cells expressing CR, including FDC, macrophages, monocytes, and B cells. This association can facilitate infection of CD4-positive and -negative cells. For example, infection could be promoted of lymphocytes trafficking through lymphoid tissue by HIV trapped on high-density CR expressed on FDC (Moir et al., 2000). The anaphylatoxin C5a has also been shown to increase the susceptibility of monocyte-derived macrophages to HIV infection (Kacani et al., 2001). Clearly, the interactions between HIV and complement are complex and a fine balance must exist between viral neutralisation and enhancement of infection.",

Several of these inhibitors are currently in clinical trials Holers, 2003, Smith and Smith, 2001 and many potential therapeutic agents have been identified to date. Indeed, the range of viral proteins exhibiting complement-regulatory activity at numerous stages of the complement cascade could also be exploited in the search for novel agents to target complement. Viral proteins may have higher affinity for complement components than host regulatory proteins, as is the case with EBV binding to CR2 via the viral gp350/220 glycoproteins (Moore et al., 1989).

Oncolytic viruses may also be utilised in tumour therapy (Wakimoto et al., 2003). Viruses being exploited for these technologies include retroviruses, adenoviruses, and HSV, and many preliminary studies have reported encouraging results. However, the implementation of gene therapy was severely and tragically compromised by the death of a patient participating in a clinical trial for the correction of a congenic liver defect. Death was due to multiple organ failure, likely induced by a severe inflammatory response to the adenovirus vector. Indeed, it has since been demonstrated that treating isolated human plasma with the same adenovirus serotype, and at concentrations matching those reached during the trial, activates complement to levels that could result in a vigorous inflammatory response (Cichon et al., 2001). Hence, a comprehensive analysis of the host immune response to viral vectors before their use in clinical studies is needed. Such evaluation should consider the ability of the host to eliminate the vector, rendering therapy unsuccessful and the potential of the vector to induce a severe inflammatory response, in which complement may play a significant role.",

This review has highlighted some of the interactions between viruses and complement. Many of these interactions are complex. This is the case with HIV, which can trigger all three pathways of complement activation and is susceptible to several of the resulting effects, yet it has also evolved a range of strategies to evade complement and can even utilise complement to enhance infection. Many viral proteins are now known to be capable of regulating complement activation and some may serve as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. Most of these viral proteins have been identified based on their homology to known cellular regulators, but several have no known homology to cellular proteins. Hence, not only may viral proteins have mechanisms of complement regulation similar to those of cellular complement regulatory proteins, and provide potential tools for dissection of complement biology, but some may also represent classes of complement regulatory proteins yet to be discovered.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Activation pathways of complement (A) and their regulation (B). (A) Three separate routes of complement activation are depicted (I\u2013III). Common to all three pathways is the formation of C3 and C5 convertase enzyme complexes. The C3 convertase (C4b2a or C3bBb) cleaves C3 into C3a (chemotaxin) and C3b. The latter protein forms the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to C5a (anaphylatoxin) and C5b. The production of C5b enables the formation of a lytic pore, known as the membrane attack complex (MAC). (I) Activation of the classical pathway results from the binding of C1q to two immunoglobulin Fc regions of antigen-bound IgG and IgM. This binding induces the autolytic cleavage of C1r and the subsequent cleavage of C1s to its active from. Activated C1s cleaves C4. The resulting C4b then binds covalently to the cell surface enabling C2 to bind. C1s then cleaves C2 complexed with C4b, generating the classical C3 convertase, C4b2a. (II) The lectin pathway is triggered in an identical manner except that it is recognized by the mannan-binding lectin (MBL) of foreign carbohydrate that activates the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP), which are capable of cleaving C4 and C2 to create the C3 convertase, C4b2a. While three separate MASPs have been identified, only MASP-2 can form a C3 convertase (reviewed in Schwaeble et al., 2002). (III) The alternative pathway is continually active, but only amplifies on an activating surface because of insufficient regulation. It also serves as a C3 convertase amplification loop for the other two pathways. The alternative pathway is triggered by the constant low-level spontaneous cleavage of C3 that occurs by nonspecific release of the internal thioester bond. The resulting hydrolysed C3 (either fluid phase or cell-bound) then forms a complex with factor B (fB), which is itself cleaved by serum protease factor D (fD). This complex then generates more C3b and results in the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb), which is further stabilised by the association of the serum protein properdin (not shown). (IV) C5b, generated by any of the previous activation pathways, associates noncovalently with C6. This association enables a loose interaction with the membrane surface, which is strengthened by the subsequent noncovalent association of C7 and C8 that causes insertion of the complex into the membrane. The full membrane attack complex consists of a lytic pore formed by the further incorporation of 12\u201316 molecules of C9. (B) Complement is regulated by several mechanisms (see also Table 1): (I) surface-bound and serum proteins accelerate the decay of the C3 convertases, in many cases, (II) subsequently inducing factor I (fI) cleavage of the covalently attached components of the C3 convertase to fragments that can no longer bind C2 (see AI and AII) or fB (see AIII). (III) Conversely, other regulators act through \u201csuicide\u201d irreversible association with either the terminal complement components (CD59) or the initial C1qrs complex of the classical pathway (C1 inhibitor) resulting in subsequent removal of the C1rs protease complex.",
