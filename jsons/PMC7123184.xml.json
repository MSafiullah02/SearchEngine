            "text": "The immune status of the host is critical in determining the risk/benefit associated with corticosteroids therapy. Corticosteroids are likely to compound the immuno-paresis in immune-paresed patients increasing the risk of acquired infections. Classic teaching suggests that tissue injury from trauma and surgery results in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with \u201cunbridled inflammation\u201d which after a few days/weeks evolves into an immuno-paretic phase known as the compensated anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) [5\u20139]. However, multiple reports over the last two decades have indicated that the proliferative response to T cell mitogens is significantly impaired in patients and experimental animals immediately after traumatic or thermal injury [10\u201314]. The T-cell dysfunction after traumatic stress is characterized by a decrease in T-cell proliferation, an aberrant cytokine profile, decreased T-cell monocyte interactions and attenuated expression of the T-cell Receptor Complex (TCR). Furthermore, surgical stress induces a shift in the T-helper (Th)1/Th2 balance resulting in impaired cell mediated immunity [15\u201317]. While the Th1 cytokines may be increased following trauma and surgery, these cytokines do not reach the levels seen in patients with sepsis and unlike patients with sepsis, the Th2 response predominates. As corticosteroids are likely to compound the immuno-paresis following trauma and stress these agents are probably best avoided in the surgical patient who becomes septic. This hypothesis is supported by the failure of corticosteroids to improve outcome in the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock Study (CORTICUS) study where the majority of patients were surgical patients [18]. It would therefore appear illogical to give septic post-surgical patient corticosteroids as this is only likely to compound the immunosuppressive state and increase the risk of secondary infections (which is exactly what the CORTISUS study demonstrated). Furthermore, it should be noted that the incidence of CIRCI is very low in surgical/trauma patients. In a 5 year retrospective study of 2,100 trauma patients admitted to an ICU the incidence of CIRCI was only 3.3 % [19]. Similarly, in an analysis of 1,795 intubated trauma patients, 82 (4.5 %) were diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency [20]. Fann and colleagues performed statistical modeling to predict adrenal insufficiency in trauma patients [21]. In this study 3.3 % of patients admitted to the ICU were diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency.",

In this study, patients who died in the ICU following sepsis compared with patients who died of non-sepsis etiologies had biochemical, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical findings consistent with severe immunosuppression. In patients with sepsis, the initial pro-inflammatory response is followed by three distinct clinical pathways, namely i) homeostasis is restored with return to a \u201cnormal immune status\u201d ii) patients may develop a prolonged a pro-inflammatory response with ongoing tissue injury iii) while other patients may progress to a state of immuno-suppression (CARS). It is important for clinicians to be able to accurately determine the patients\u2019 immune status before instituting immunomodulating interventions. It is likely that patients who receive corticosteroids late in the course of their disease and have progressed to CARS will suffer adverse sequela from such therapy (see timing below). Future research in sepsis will need to focus on developing tools that can dynamically and in real-time characterize the patient\u2019s immune response to allow targeted immune therapy.",

The time dependent initiation of the use of corticosteroids has not been taken into consideration in those studies (and meta-analyses) which have analyzed the benefits/risk of steroids in sepsis. In the study by Annane et al., the window for enrollment into the study was initially 3 h and then it was increased to 8 h [23]. In the CORTICUS study, the initial time frame of 24 h, increased to 72 h [18]. This time dependent effect was demonstrated by Park et al. who in a retrospective analysis of 178 patients with septic shock found that corticosteroids were only of benefit if given within 6 h after the onset of septic shock-related hypotension [24]. Similarly, Katsenos et al. demonstrated that in patients receiving hydrocortisone for septic shock initiation of therapy within 9 h was associated with improved survival [25]. Furthermore, ex-vivo mononuclear stimulation studies demonstrated attenuated TNF-\u03b1 release only in those patients who received early corticosteroid therapy.",

Trials from the 1980s which investigated short-term (24\u201348 h) massive glucocorticoid doses (up to 40,000 mg/hydrocortisone eq./day) were associated with an increased risk of side effects, and no clear outcomes benefit [33, 34].

There is ample evidence that early removal of glucocorticoid treatment may lead to rebound inflammation and an exaggerated cytokine response to endotoxin [26, 35\u201342]. Experimental work has shown that short-term exposure of alveolar macrophages or animals to dexamethasone is followed by enhanced inflammatory cytokine response to endotoxin [43, 44]. Similarly, normal human subjects pretreated with hydrocortisone had significantly higher TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 response after endotoxin challenge compared to controls [45]. Two potential mechanisms may explain rebound inflammation: homologous down-regulation and GC-induced adrenal insufficiency. Glucocorticoid treatment down-regulates the GR levels in most cell types, thereby decreasing the efficacy of the treatment [46]. Down-regulation takes place at both the transcriptional and translational level, and hormone treatment decreases receptor half-life by approximately 50 % [46]. In experimental animals, overexpression of GRs improves resistance to endotoxin-mediated septic shock while GR blockade increases mortality [47].",

In addition, these authors demonstrated that patients with this polymorphism receiving hydrocortisone had a much greater 30-day-mortality (57.6 %) than the other genotypes (24.4 %; HR: 3.18, 95 % CI: 1.61\u20136.28; p = 0.001).

Cortisol diffuses rapidly across cell membranes binding to the GR. Two isoforms of the GR have been isolated, namely GR-\u03b1 and GR-\u03b2. The GR-\u03b2 isoform fails to bind cortisol and activate gene expression and thus functions as a negative inhibitor of GR-\u03b1 [50]. Through the association and disassociation of chaperone molecules the glucocorticoid-GR-\u03b1 complex moves into the nucleus where it binds as a homodimer to DNA sequences called glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE\u2019s) located in the promoter regions of target genes which then activate or repress transcription of the associated genes.",

These authors demonstrated a markedly reduced nuclear density of the GR-complex in non-improvers while the cytoplasmic density was similar between improvers and non-improvers. This study suggests glucocorticoid resistance due to diminished nuclear translocation of the GR-complex.

Varying doses (37.5\u201340,000 mg/hydrocortisone eq./day), dosing strategies (single bolus/repeat boluses/continuous infusion/dose taper) and duration of therapy (1\u201332 days) were used in these studies [33, 55]. Despite multiple guidelines and over 20 meta-analyses, the use of glucocorticoids in patients with sepsis remains extremely controversial with conflicting recommendations. Furthermore, while there are large geographic variations in the prescription of glucocorticoids for sepsis up to 50 % of ICU patients receive such therapy [56]. Currently a number of large multicenter RCT\u2019s are being conducted, which should hopefully resolve this issue. While it is difficult to make strong evidence based recommendations at this time, an evidence based review of the literature allows one to make the following conclusions [57, 58]:\ni.Short-course high-dose glucocorticoids are not beneficial in the treatment of severe sepsis/septic shock and ARDS [34, 59, 60].ii.Treatment of septic shock with moderate-dose glucocorticoids for 7 days significantly reduces vasopressor dependency (ACTH responders and non-responders) and ICU length of stay [34, 59, 60].iii.Glucocorticoids may reduce mortality in sub-groups of patients with septic shock [34, 59, 60].iv.In patients\u2019 with progressive early (<72 h) ARDS glucocorticoids significantly increase the number of ventilator, ICU and hospital free days with a reduction in the risk of death [58].v.Glucocorticoids appear to be of no benefit in patients with sepsis who are at a low risk of dying and in patients with mild and rapidly resolving ARDS [61].vi.Glucocorticoids do not increase the risk of super-infections [34, 59, 60].vii.The addition of fludrocortisone does not appear to have additional benefits when treating patients with hydrocortisone [62].viii.Treatment with glucocorticoids may reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder [63].ix.Etomidate causes suppression of cortisol synthesis for up to 24 h [64].

In patients\u2019 with sepsis and/or ARDS corticosteroids should never be stopped abruptly; this will lead to a \u201crebound\u201d of inflammatory mediators with an increased likelihood of hypotension and/or rebound inflammation (lung injury). A continuous infusion of glucocorticoid may be associated with better (smoother) glycemic control [68]. Since blood glucose variability has been demonstrated to have prognostic implications [69, 70], this may be the preferable method of dosing.Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 6 hourly or 100 mg bolus then 10 mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 days, and ideally for 10\u201314 days.

In the ICU setting the most important complications include immune suppression, hyperglycemia and HPA axis and GR suppression. Both glucocorticoids and TNF-\u03b1 stimulate muscle catabolism (reviewed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-11020-2_32). Since glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1 it is likely that corticosteroids may limit muscle breakdown during acute illness. This postulate is supported by the fact that patients with ARDS treated with glucocorticoids have significantly increased ventilator free days. In the CORTICUS study neuromuscular weakness was very rarely reported [18]. While myopathy is common in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids this complication is uncommon with stress dose corticosteroids [33, 55]. Similarly, while high dose corticosteroids may impair wound healing this complication does not occur with stress dose corticosteroids. Schreiber et al. reported that the use of corticosteroids in ICU patients was associated with an increased risk of delirium [71]. In this study the authors were unable to establish a relationship between the dose of corticosteroid and the risk of delirium.",
