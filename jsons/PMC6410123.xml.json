            "text": "An increase in pediatric patients with influenza-like symptoms in Queen Mary Hospital (July to October 2014) led to a question as to whether the putatively host-adapted human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-E4) [1] is circulating in Hong Kong. HAdV-E4 was one of the first viral respiratory pathogens to be isolated (\u201cR(espiratory)I(nfection)-(number)67\u201d; 1952) [2]. It is intriguingly extraordinary in several aspects, the first being that it is one of only two adenoviruses for which a vaccine was developed, thrice (1956, 1971, and 2011), at considerable effort and expense, attesting to its potency (https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/adenovirus-vaccines-reinstated-after-long-absence) [3]. Each vaccine cessation resulted in immediate reemergence as a major pathogen [4]. Second, HAdV-E4 was typically and inexplicably restricted to U.S. military populations [3,5,6], with occasional yet limited infections tallied in pathogen surveys of civilian populations [5,6,7]. Third, taxonomically, HAdV-E4 differed from other HAdVs with respect to protein chemistry properties [8] and low-resolution genomics data, including partial sequences and restriction enzyme maps [9]. Its classification, with genome sequence, as the sole HAdV comprising clade or \u201cspecies\u201d E, with 14 simian adenoviruses (SAdVs), adds to its mystique [1,10]. Origins included speculations of being the archetypical HAdV [9] or a HAdV species B and C recombinant. Genome analysis showed RI-67 was a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdV) [1,10], with a genome identity of 89.8% and 89.2% to SAdV-E26 and SAdV-E25, respectively. These are much higher than two respiratory pathogens HAdV-B7 at 73.7% and HAdV-C1 at 65.7%, with ocular pathogen HAdV-D9 at 70.4%.",

            "text": "The zoonotic threat potential of adenoviruses is recognized [11], and HAdV-E4 represents the first example. Notably, both the HAdV-E4 prototype and contemporaneous \u201cvaccine\u201d isolates contain a genome signature that is unique to ChAdVs and other SAdVs, i.e., the absence of the Nuclear Factor I (NF-I) binding site that is conserved among the three replication motifs embedded in nearly all HAdV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) [1]. NF-I is a host transcription factor that binds to nt 23\u201336 of the HAdV-2 origin of replication [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] and is recruited by the human adenoviral replication complex [12,17]. It is firmly established as essential through in vitro and in vivo studies (see [18,19] and qtd. in), including replication reconstitution assays, as necessary for efficient adenoviral replication in human cells (see [20] and qtd. in). Recent isolates are recombinants containing this HAdV replication motif [1], presumably permitting an expansion of the virus range into the immune-na\u00efve populations [5,6,7,21,22,23], and should be noted as a molecular evolution example of a post-zoonotic, host-adaptation of a \u201cnovel\u201d and \u201cemergent\u201d human pathogen.",

            "text": "As noted in the literature, the ITR contains critical conserved DNA replication motifs that include the human transcription factor binding site, NF-I, which is shown to enhance and optimize HAdV replication and growth [2,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. All of the 10 Hong Kong isolates (red) possess this host-adapted ITR, i.e., they have the NF-I binding site that is found in all human respiratory adenoviruses (yellow) (Figure 1). However, this motif is missing in SAdV ITRs (purple) [18], as well as the \u201cold\u201d HAdV-E4 strains (green), e.g., prototype (1952) and \u201cvaccine\u201d (1962) strains, i.e., they have only the core origin and the NF-III motif [1]. The absence of the NF-I motif likely plays a role in limiting the circulation of both SAdVs and prototype HAdV-E4 in human populations, as its acquisition presumably provides efficient and enhanced replication in human cells, i.e., allowed HAdV-E4 to adapt to the new host. This may be the \u201ctipping point\u201d that allows HAdV-E4 entry into the general population that is immunologically-na\u00efve to its epsilon antigen, as HAdV-E4 does not normally circulate outside the U.S. military populations [3,5,6,7]. This is consistent with reports documenting recombination as an evolution mechanism in the genesis of emergent HAdV pathogens [24], illustrated by HAdV-D53 [25] and HAdV-B55 [24]. HAdV-B55 is a recent major respiratory pathogen in China, after years of quiescence, by virtue of its introduction into immunologically-na\u00efve populations, i.e., without antibodies to its HAdV-B11-like epsilon antigen. Another example is the reemergence of a long-dormant respiratory pathogen HAdV-B14 into an immunologically-na\u00efve population [26].",

For example, the two earliest genomes, isolated within 10 years, are 99.9% identical to each other, differing by 18 mismatches and two insertions (one one-base and one three-base) [35]. One striking difference is a recombination resulting in recent HAdV-E4 genomes acquiring a well-characterized replication-enhancing NF-I motif that distinguishes these isolates from the 1952 prototype and a contemporaneous 1965 co-circulating strain. Although the acquisition of this critical replication motif alone may explain the potentially wider distribution of HAdV-E4, the pair-wise sequence analyses also reveal additional potentially important sequence differences in the E3 gene region [36]. Proteins encoded in the E3 region are involved in interactions with the host immune response and evasion and represent the most variable region between HAdV types [37,38,39]. This report highlights the need to re-explore the understudied E3 genes and their critical roles in the human immune response upon HAdV infection.",

This host adaptation may be significant as HAdV-E4 is a highly contagious pathogen with demonstrated morbidity and mortality implications and has now been reported in global civilian populations [6,7,23]. During the preparation of this report, to emphasize further the potential of HAdV-E4 emergence in the global general population, seroepidemiological data identifying HAdV-E4 infections in China and Sierra Leone (Africa) were published [40]. Explicitly, the authors note \u201cAn apparent increase in the frequency of human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-4) infections among general populations has been observed over the past 10 years\u201d [40].",
