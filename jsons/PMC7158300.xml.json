Specifically, peripheral thermoreceptors, which are generally most sensitive to low temperatures, are located in the skin and around certain great veins, as well as in some deep tissues, such as the spinal cord and abdominal viscera. Central thermoreceptors include large numbers of heat-sensitive neurons and lower numbers of cold-sensitive neurons in the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus (POA). In response to changes in temperature, the peripheral and central thermoreceptors transmit signals into the posterior hypothalamic area, subsequently activating autonomic and behavioral effector responses to regulate body temperature. These responses affect the balance between heat loss and heat production.",

            "text": "There are multiple mechanisms for cooling in response to elevations in body temperature, which include both means of increasing heat loss and decreasing heat production.3, 4, 5 One means of increasing heat loss is by transferring heat from the body core to the surface by increasing blood flow to the skin. Changes in core body temperature and environmental temperature cause the sympathetic nervous system to regulate the degree of vasoconstriction and thus the amount of blood flow, with increases in temperature resulting in cutaneous vasodilation and increased skin blood flow. Heat is lost from body surfaces to the surroundings by several physical mechanisms, including radiation, conduction, and convection. Evaporation is also an important mechanism of heat loss in horses.5 To some extent, the amount of evaporative heat loss is controlled by the rate of sweating. However, even when the animal is not sweating, water evaporates insensibly from the skin and lungs, resulting in continual heat loss. In horses, evaporative heat loss, primarily through increased sweating but also through increased respiration, becomes more important as the ambient temperature rises and during exercise.5, 6 In addition to increased heat loss when the body temperature rises, the horse also decreases temperature further by inhibiting means of heat production, such as shivering, and by behavioral responses, such as seeking shade and wind currents and wading into water.6, 7, 8\n",

            "text": "Mechanisms that increase body temperature are triggered when the body temperature is too low.2 Heat is conserved by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic sympathetic centers, leading to cutaneous vasoconstriction and piloerection. Heat production also increases and may occur through increased muscle activity ranging from inapparent contractions to generalized shivering. Shivering may increase heat production by 4 to 5 times baseline. The primary motor center for shivering is in the posterior hypothalamus, which normally is stimulated by cold signals from the peripheral receptors and to some extent central receptors in the POA. Digestion of food also contributes to total body heat. Sympathetic stimulation may increase the rate of cellular metabolism, increasing heat production by chemical thermogenesis. Cooling also increases the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, ultimately increasing thyroid hormones and cellular metabolism and further contributing to chemical thermogenesis. In addition to these physiologic adaptations, behavioral responses to conserve heat also occur, such as adopting a huddled stance, aggregating in groups, and seeking shelter.9, 10, 11 It has been demonstrated that horses voluntarily select shelter, especially under wet, windy conditions and that shelter selection is affected by breed, body condition score, and hair coat weight.9\n",

            "text": "Malignant hyperthermia (MH) encompasses a group of inherited skeletal muscle disorders in which calcium metabolism is altered. Although the condition is most common in human beings and pigs, it has been reported in several species, including dogs and horses.20, 21, 22, 23 MH is characterized by a hypermetabolic state of muscle that generally is induced by halogenated inhalation anesthetics, depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants, and occasionally local anesthetics or stressors such as heat or vigorous exercise. Clinical signs include a rapid increase in core body temperature, skeletal muscle rigidity, and tachycardia. Affected animals may develop significant acidosis and muscle necrosis, and the condition can be fatal. MH is most often associated with a defect in the ryanodine receptor.20, 23 In Quarter Horses and American Paint Horses, MH is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait that is linked to a single point mutation in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) gene at nucleotide C7360G.23, 24 This mutation can be identified by genetic testing. Horses with polysaccharide storage myopathy tend to have a more severe clinical phenotype if they are concurrently affected with the MH mutation.24\n",

The response is generally biphasic, with early and late phases. In the early phase of fever, LPS taken up by the Kupffer cells of the liver activates the complement cascade, with C5a rapidly stimulating the Kupffer cells to produce PGE2. This peripherally produced PGE2 may then act primarily via two pathways to affect thermoregulation. First, this PGE2 may be transported by the bloodstream to the ventromedial POA where it acts on thermoregulatory neurons to increase the set-point. Second, it may interact with receptors on hepatic vagal afferents, leading to activation of pathways projecting to the medulla oblongata and then to the POA via the ventral noradrenergic bundle. Consequently, norepinephrine is secreted, which then stimulates \u03b11-adrenoreceptors on thermoregulatory neurons, evoking a rise in core temperature. In the late phase of fever, there is further production of PGE2 following both direct induction of its synthesizing enzymes via TLR signaling and the production of endogenous pyrogens resulting in the central production of PGE2.",

Among the most potent of the endogenous pyrogens are interleukin-1 (IL-1) \u03b1 and \u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2013alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Others include TNF-\u03b2, IL-6, and interferon-\u03b1.

            "text": "The production of both peripheral and central PGE2 is key in the pathogenesis of fever. PGE2 is basically synthesized in three steps involving phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase, and terminal PGE synthetase. These enzymes are upregulated in fever.34 The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway is clearly important in the pathogenesis of fever because COX inhibitors, and specifically COX-2 inhibitors, effectively reduce the febrile response but have no effect on the normal body temperature.43, 44 At the same time that there is upregulation of proteins involved in prostaglandin production, there is transcriptional downregulation of proteins involved in PGE2 inactivation, such as 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase. Once produced, PGE2 interacts with E type prostaglandin receptors (EP receptors), of which there are currently four identified subtypes with differential expression in various areas of the hypothalamus and brainstem.45 It appears that the EP3 receptor in the median preoptic nucleus within the POA of the hypothalamus is particularly important in the febrile response. The interaction of prostaglandins with their receptors initiates neuronal signaling by producing a cascade of changes in cyclic nucleotides, calcium, and monoamines leading to a higher set-point in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. For example, interaction with the EP3 receptor mediates decreases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which results in decreased firing of warm-sensitive neurons, increased firing of cold-sensitive neurons, and ultimately fever.",

A number of antipyretic substances, sometimes referred to as either endogenous or autogenous cryogens, may be liberated systemically or within the brain during fever.31, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 Some of the antipyretic effects occur via an inhibitory influence on the formation or action or endogenous pyrogens or via effects on neuronal thermoregulatory circuits that are activated during fever. The interactions between pyrogens and cryogens are complex, and some cytokines function as either depending on the circumstance. Some endogenous antipyretic substances include glucocorticoids, neuropeptides/hormones (arginine vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone MSH, \u03b3-MSH), cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-10), lipocortin, nitric oxide, and epoxyeicosanoids.31, 47, 49 One of the major antipyretics is IL-10. Following induction by pyrogenic cytokines, IL-10 inhibits further production of IL-1 and TNF. Also, \u03b1-MSH has significant antipyretic effects, being more effective in controlling fever than acetaminophen when administered to human beings.49 Nitric oxide also has an antipyretic role, mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the POA.50 Even PGE2, whose role is primarily in the induction of fever, may produce hypothermic responses when interacting with the EP4 receptor.45\n",

Although the elevation in temperature may directly impair organism growth in some cases, the beneficial effects are thought to be primarily associated with enhanced host defenses.40, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 Fever has beneficial effects on multiple aspects of both the innate and adaptive immune response. As part of the acute phase response associated with fever, the concentration of iron, which is required by many bacteria for multiplication, decreases.59, 60, 61 The beneficial effects of fever, however, are not universal, and many of the positive effects of fever are reversed when temperature becomes extremely high.43, 62 In rabbits experimentally infected with Pasteurella multocida, the survival rate increased in association with elevations in body temperature up to 2.25\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) above normal but decreased with elevations above this level.63 The increased catabolism, variable anorexia, and increased metabolic rate can lead to muscle wasting and weakness when fever is prolonged.

In veterinary medicine, the term fever of unknown origin is often used more loosely, referring to any prolonged, unexplained fever. In many cases, the cause of a fever of unknown origin is a common disease with an unusual presentation. In a review of 63 cases of fever of unknown origin in the horse, the specific criteria used to define fever of unknown origin included (1) illness of at least 3 weeks\u2019 duration associated with nonspecific signs, (2) body temperature of at least 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) on several occasions, and (3) no clear diagnosis after an initial complete blood count and serum biochemical profile.66 The most common cause was found to be infection, which was responsible for 43% of the cases. Other causes included neoplasms in 22% of cases; immune-mediated diseases in 6.5%; and miscellaneous diseases such as toxic hepatopathy, parasitism, and others in 19%. In 9.5% of cases no diagnosis was made. Specifically, the most common conditions identified were abdominal infections (peritonitis/abdominal abscessation) and lymphosarcoma, each accounting for approximately 16% of cases. Pneumonia, pleuropneumonia, or both were found in 11% of cases. Three horses (approximately 5%) were found to have bacterial endocarditis, and in each case a murmur was not identified initially but developed within several weeks of the onset of illness. Thus the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin requires a systematic approach with emphasis on the evaluation of infectious disease.",

In general, intermittent fevers are characterized by recurring paroxysms of elevated temperature followed by periods of normal temperature, such as those fevers that demonstrate diurnal variation. In most cases of intermittent fever the temperature tends to peak in the late afternoon or evening. Intermittent fevers most often are associated with infectious causes, particularly viral infections, although they may be seen with a variety of other conditions. Remittent fevers are those in which diurnal variation is exaggerated without a return to normal body temperature or those with a cyclic pattern in which the temperature elevation lasts for several days, such as may be seen with equine infectious anemia virus. Biphasic fevers, in which an initial rise in body temperature precedes a period of normal temperature and then a second rise, are characteristic of certain diseases such as equine neorickettsiosis (Potomac horse fever).

In cases of hypoalbuminemia, gastrointestinal or renal loss, third space loss, and decreased production associated with significant hepatic disease should be investigated.

            "text": "There is increasing awareness of the role fat itself plays in the development of metabolic disease and inflammation.99, 100, 101 Previously, adipose tissue was considered simply an energy storage depot with a fixed number of adipocytes. Any increase in adipose mass was thought to occur due to increased fat storage within existing cells resulting in hypertrophy. However, it is now recognized that adipose tissue is a complex endocrine organ that contains a large pool of stem cells and preadipocytes that can be recruited once existing adipocytes reach a critical level of hypertrophy. Thus in obesity there is generally both hypertrophy and proliferation of adipocytes. The adipocytes are biologically active and influence multiple physiologic processes including energy metabolism, cardiovascular function, reproductive function, inflammation, and immunity. The cells secrete a wide variety of cell-signaling proteins, or cytokines, known as adipokines, that function in both an autocrine/paracrine and endocrine fashion.100 Due to local influences, adipocytes from differing anatomic locations may vary in their specific pattern of expression of these adipokines. Currently at least 100 substances are thought to be secreted by adipocytes. Some important adipose-derived hormones include leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, and angiotensinogen. Adipokines that act as proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators include TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as monocyte chemotactic protein\u20131 and plasminogen activator inhibitor. The altered expression of adipokines in obesity can influence a number of metabolic processes and contribute to EMS.101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 Adipokines may inhibit insulin signal transduction pathways contributing to insulin resistance. Leptin, which is involved in satiety and regulation of obesity, is elevated in horses with IR, suggesting leptin resistance. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing hormone, can be decreased in obese horses. In humans and rodents, obesity is linked with an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by adipocytes. This results in a chronic inflammatory state and contributes to insulin dysregulation. Studies in horses, however, have yielded variable results regarding the expression of inflammatory mediators in obese horses, and further investigation is needed to understand their role in EMS.95, 104, 105, 106\n",

As normal values may vary among laboratories, it is ideal to use reference ranges specific for the laboratory being used, especially when evaluating IR and PPID. Also, any significant ongoing pain or stress should be taken into account as these conditions can affect glucose and insulin dynamics, as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. Horses with both suspected EMS and PPID should be screened for IR. Current tests for evaluating IR focus primarily on measurements of glucose and insulin.80, 81 It is generally recommended to limit feed before sampling to one flake of grass hay low in nonstructural carbohydrates per 500 kg of body weight given no later than 10 pm the night before. As IR is often well compensated, baseline concentrations of glucose and insulin may be normal or in many cases the glucose is normal whereas the insulin is elevated. Occasionally horses will develop diminished glycemic control and become hyperglycemic (greater than 150 mg/dL) consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are several mathematical calculations such as the glucose:insulin ratio and reciprocal inverse square of insulin (RISQI) that are occasionally used to help assess insulin sensitivity.114 Because resting concentrations of both glucose and insulin can be normal in IR, dynamic testing is often indicated. Practical dynamic tests include the oral sugar test (OST) and the combined intravenous glucose-insulin test (CGIT). Other diagnostic tests that may be useful in assessing IR include measurement of triglyceride and leptin concentrations, both of which may be elevated in IR.",

This can result from actual underfeeding or from other factors such as excessive competition between horses or lameness preventing the horse from accessing the feed easily.117 Also, the nutritional value of feed, particularly forage, can vary widely, and poor quality feed can be a significant factor in malnutrition.2.\nDysphagia: Dysphagia, difficulty with prehension, mastication, or swallowing, can occur in horses for many reasons with resultant decreased feed intake and weight loss. One common cause of difficulty eating, especially in older horses, is abnormal dentition.3.\nMalabsorption/malassimilation: Malabsorption is the inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or transport.118 Both macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) can be affected. Normal absorption is a complex process involving multiple organs, enzymes, and hormones, as well as transport and secretory mechanisms. Impairment of any of the steps in this process can result in malabsorption. Rapid gastrointestinal transit time can also contribute to malabsorption. In horses, malabsorption is often associated with conditions that damage the intestinal wall, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, infiltrative neoplasms, parasitism, and certain gastrointestinal infections.119 In foals, both primary and secondary lactase deficiency have been identified as causes of malabsorption.120 Depending on the underlying cause of the malabsorption, weight loss may occur in the face of normal dietary intake.4.\nAnorexia: Anorexia, which is a loss of appetite, frequently contributes to weight loss, especially when prolonged. Anorexia may be either partial or complete, and occasionally the term hyporexia is used to describe partial anorexia. A wide variety of diseases are associated with anorexia, and in many cases, the decreased desire for feed is combined with increased energy expenditure, resulting in significant weight loss. The pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in anorexia are not fully understood, but it appears that there are disturbances of hypothalamic pathways controlling energy homeostasis and that multiple mediators including hormones, neuropeptides, and cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 are involved.121, 122\n\n",

            "text": "In general, causes of increased energy demand can be categorized as physiologic or pathologic.1.\nPhysiologic causes of increased energy demand: Physiologic weight loss may be seen with conditions requiring increased energy, such as late pregnancy, early lactation, and intense exercise. Environmental stress, especially decreased ambient temperature, can also have a significant impact on caloric requirements.123, 124, 125 In adult horses, the lower critical temperature, which is the temperature below which the horse must increase metabolic heat production to maintain normal body temperature, ranges from 5\u00b0C (4\u00b0F) to \u221215\u00b0C (5\u00b0F) depending on the horse\u2019s adaptation to the environment. The digestible energy requirements are estimated to increase by 2.5% for every degree Celsius below the lower critical temperature. Energy requirements are further increased by wet, windy conditions. It is estimated that in cold temperatures when the hair coat is wet the maintenance digestible energy requirement may increase by as much as 50%.2.\nPathologic causes of increased energy demand: Many disease processes will result in weight loss, not only because anorexia is common, but because there is frequently a concomitant increase in energy expenditure.126 Fever itself appears to increase energy needs. In human patients, the resting energy requirement is estimated to increase by approximately 14% for each degree C increase in body temperature. However, the increase in energy requirement associated with disease is not consistent. For example, it was determined that the resting energy requirement of critically ill neonatal foals (40\u201350 kcal/kg body weight per day) was less than that of control foals (60\u201380 kcal/kg body weight per day).127 The regulation of energy requirements in disease is complex and remains poorly understood.3.Cachexia is a specific multifactorial syndrome associated with underlying illness that is defined by the loss of skeletal muscle with or without the loss of fat mass.128, 129, 130 Cachexia is characterized by a negative protein and energy balance driven by a variable combination of reduced feed intake and abnormal metabolism, and it cannot be fully reversed by nutritional support. The pathophysiology of this syndrome involves multiple mechanisms.130, 131, 132, 133 It is in part mediated by cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and proteolysis inducing factor. TNF-\u03b1 was originally designated as cachectin due to its catabolic effects. In human patients, muscle catabolism has been associated with TNF-\u03b1 in a variety of conditions such as cancer, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on studies in cultured muscle cells, it appears the increased muscle catabolism associated with TNF-\u03b1 is mediated by reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor-\u03ba\u03b2, which upregulate ubiquitin/proteasome activity.134 There are several additional mechanisms of cytokine mediated cachexia, including activation of the hypothalamic melanocortin system and upregulation of the cytokine-activated transcription factor STAT3.128, 129, 132, 133, 134 The endocrine system also has a role in cachexia. There is often a reduction in circulating anabolic hormones associated with disease. In cancer patients, tumor-derived parathyroid hormone\u2013related protein (PTHrP) appears to play a role in cachexia.131 In chronic disease states such as congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, it appears that the renin-angiotensin system has a major role in producing cachexia.133 Angiotensin II concentrations are often elevated in chronic disease, and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can improve weight loss.4.Several additional mechanisms may contribute to increased energy requirements during systemic disease.126, 128, 129, 130 The stress associated with disease may alter metabolism due to increases in sympathetic and hormonal activity. Chronic pain may also result in elevated systemic catecholamine and cortisol concentrations, resulting in a catabolic state. In recurrent airway obstruction, the work of breathing can increase energy requirements. An increase in nutrient demand can be seen in association with protein loss in conditions such as peritonitis, pleuritis, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and burns. Also, although thyroid disease is uncommon in horses, weight loss has been recognized in association with hyperthyroidism and the accompanying increase in basal metabolic rate.135, 136\n5.Aging in multiple species has been associated with unintentional weight loss and sarcopenia, which is a loss in muscle mass, quality, and strength associated specifically with aging. The mechanisms behind this structural and functional decline in skeletal muscle are complex.137 In horses, aging alone has been associated with a loss of weight and muscles.138, 139 Horses affected with PPID may be particularly susceptible to muscle loss due to atrophy of type 2A and 2B muscle fibers and loss of type 2B fibers.115, 140 Proposed mechanisms of steroid-related myopathy in horses with PPID include myocyte apoptosis, negative regulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03ba\u0392) activation and function, and oxidative stress.6.It is not uncommon for weight loss to involve multiple mechanisms at the same time. Not only may decreased energy intake and increased energy demand be present concurrently, but there may be multiple mechanisms contributing to the decreased intake and increased demand. For example, in recurrent airway obstruction there may be increased demands from both the work of breathing and the presence of inflammatory cytokines. In parasitism, there is competition for nutrients within the gastrointestinal tract, as well as damage to the gastrointestinal wall resulting in inflammation and malabsorption of both macronutrients and micronutrients.\n",

Although a multitude of organisms may be involved, Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (strangles) and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (pigeon fever) are particularly important. Weight loss is a common clinical finding in horses with either chronic hepatic or renal disease, and weight loss has also been recognized with heart failure. In some cases, recurrent airway obstruction can also be associated with significant weight loss. Several neoplastic conditions can cause weight loss, and in horses, lymphosarcoma is particularly common.",

Due to relative changes in pleural and airway pressures there is dynamic compression of the larger airways during expiration, which helps to maximize the velocity of airflow by decreasing the airway diameter. The high-velocity turbulent airflow results in airway vibration, which is largely responsible for the sound recognized as cough. Importantly, the high flows generated in the expiratory phase dislodge mucus and facilitate the removal of mucus and debris from the tracheobronchial tree.

Neurons within the nTS communicate with other brainstem neurons as part of a multifunctional, dynamic neural network that functions in both generation of the normal breathing pattern and cough. This neural network has been referred to as the cough pattern generator as well as the respiratory pattern generator or central controller. When cough occurs, there is reshaping of the discharge patterns of respiratory neurons within this neural network resulting in discharges being transmitted to the motor neurons involved in cough. Projections between the brainstem and cortical centers add complexity to the regulation of both breathing and cough. Due to cortical modulation, some cough can be voluntarily initiated and suppressed. Among the receptors involved in the generation of cough in the brainstem are N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and in several species antagonists of NMDA-type glutamate receptors such as dextromethorphan have been effective antitussives.195, 196\n",

Paroxysmal or persistent coughing can cause fatigue and may decrease feed intake, particularly in foals. Chronic cough can result in bronchial muscle hypertrophy. Cough can also have significant cardiovascular effects due to changes in abdominal and intrathoracic pressures.199, 200 During the expiratory phase of cough there is an initial rise in systemic arterial blood pressure and a concurrent rise in cerebral venous and cerebrospinal fluid pressures. This is followed by a period of hypotension, which can reduce the effective perfusion pressure of the brain, especially when there is high cerebral venous pressure. The resulting cerebral hypoperfusion and anoxia have been associated with cough-induced syncope in dogs as well as people.201, 202 Some other potential adverse effects of cough that have been reported in small animals and people include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and lung lobe torsion, as well as rib and vertebral fractures.199, 202\n",

            "text": "Cough in conjunction with fever is most often associated with infection of the respiratory tract, although some noninfectious conditions such as neoplasia can also occasionally present with fever. Infection of the respiratory tract may be primary or may be secondary to an underlying condition such as inflammation of the airways. Viral infections of the respiratory tract are a common cause of cough in horses and are particularly important as they can cause outbreaks of respiratory disease.203, 204 Affected horses often present with an acute onset of a dry cough in conjunction with fever, lethargy, and anorexia. Some important equine respiratory viruses include equine influenzavirus, equine herpesviruses (EHVs), equine rhinitis A and B, and equine viral arteritis. With regard to the equine herpesviruses, EHV-4 and EHV-1 are the major pathogens associated with acute respiratory disease in the domestic horse population.204, 205 Respiratory viruses frequently cause exposure and sensitization of cough receptors, along with injury to epithelial cells and decreased mucociliary clearance, which can predispose the affected horse to secondary bacterial infection. In addition to viruses, both bacterial and fungal agents can cause infection of the respiratory tract, and are often associated with a periodic wet cough due to increased mucus production and neutrophil accumulation. Bacterial infection is particularly common in the lower respiratory tract and can cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or pleuropneumonia.206, 207 A variety of organisms have been isolated and polymicrobial infections may occur. Some common pathogens include Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Pasteurella, Actinobacillus spp., Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rhodococcus equi is an important cause of pneumonia in foals. Anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, may also infect the lower airways of horses. Mycobacterium and Mycoplasma spp. are occasionally isolated from horses with respiratory tract disease.206, 208 Fungal respiratory disease in horses is uncommon and is most often recognized in the paranasal sinuses, guttural pouches, and lungs.209, 210 Some primary fungal pathogens that have been identified in association with respiratory disease in the horse include Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Conidiobolus coronatus. Opportunistic fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., and Pneumocystis carinii, can also cause respiratory tract disease. Following recovery from infectious respiratory tract disease of any cause, horses will often have a persistent wet or dry cough as the cough receptors remain hypersensitive.",

Summer pasture-associated RAO (SPARAO, summer pasture-associated obstructive pulmonary disease, SPAOPD) is a subset of RAO in which signs occur after exposure to pasture in warm summer months. RAO primarily affects horses over 7 years of age. The prevalence of RAO is approximately 10% to 20%, and a familial predisposition has been identified.219, 220, 221, 222 Affected horses typically have frequent coughing, increased respiratory effort at rest, and exercise intolerance. With IAD, horses may be affected at any age, and the clinical signs are more subtle. Both RAO and IAD are characterized by increased mucus in the airways. With regard to the specific cytologic abnormalities in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), RAO is typically characterized by pronounced neutrophilia (greater than 25%), whereas in IAD the abnormalities tend to be milder and more variable. Other conditions that can resemble equine asthma clinically include silicosis, lungworm infection, and idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia.223, 224, 225, 226\n",

In donkeys and mules, infection is generally asymptomatic but is patent, providing a source of eggs in the feces. In horses and ponies, infection often results in an inflammatory response and cough and is typically not patent, with larval development arrested in the lungs.",

Soft palate problems, including soft palate paresis, dorsal displacement of the soft palate and cleft palate, and other causes of dysphagia, can result in cough that is often associated with eating.

It should be remembered that fever can be intermittent and can be suppressed by the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Careful auscultation of the thorax should be performed. The presence of a heart murmur and tachycardia may suggest congestive heart failure, especially if there is jugular distention or pulsation.229 If the horse can tolerate it, a rebreathing examination should be performed, especially if there are no obvious abnormal sounds during quiet breathing. The rebreathing examination, which is performed by loosely placing a plastic bag over the nostrils, will cause the horse to increase tidal volume, accentuating breath sounds. Cough may be induced, especially if there is exudate in the airways. The presence of crackles and/or wheezes on auscultation suggests pulmonary parenchymal disease. With pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, or pleural fluid, breath sounds are typically decreased or absent ventrally, although occasionally sounds may be accentuated due to referral of sounds from aerated lung. Percussion can be used to identify areas of dullness. In horses with significant RAO, percussion can be used to identify a shift of the caudal lung border.236\n",

The presence and character of pleural fluid can be determined, and abnormalities such as consolidation and abscessation in the periphery of the lung can be identified. In addition, the caudal lung borders can be determined. If congestive heart failure is suspected, the heart can be evaluated by echocardiography.

            "text": "The mechanisms involved in the central control of ventilation are still not completely understood. The central controller of the brainstem integrates signals from the sensory afferent neurons and then initiates phasic activity of the diaphragmatic, intercostal, and abdominal respiratory muscles.256 Although it is a complex neuronal network, the central controller consists of two basic regions with several subregions: (1) the medullary respiratory center in the reticular formation, which includes the ventral and dorsal respiratory groups, and (2) the pontine respiratory center, which includes the pneumotaxic and apneustic centers. The medullary respiratory center controls the rhythmic pattern of respiration. The dorsal respiratory group helps to coordinate inspiratory activity by assimilating afferent information from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves and transmitting efferent signals to the muscles of inspiration and neurons in the ventral respiratory group. The ventral respiratory group consists of inspiratory and expiratory motor neurons. One subregion, the pre-Botzinger complex, appears to have a major role in generating the basic breathing rhythm.260, 261, 262, 275 Closely associated neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus and parafacial respiratory group are important in regulating expiration.275, 276 The ventral respiratory group also helps to regulate ventilation during exercise. In the pontine respiratory center, the apneustic center provides stimulatory input to inspiratory motor neurons, activating and prolonging inhalation.260, 261, 262 Damage to this region, which can result from problems such as trauma or neonatal encephalopathy, results in prolonged inspiratory gasps interrupted by transient expiratory efforts.259 The pneumotaxic center, also in the pons, inhibits the inspiratory centers and helps to regulate the volume and rate of respiration. The pneumotaxic center is not required to maintain a normal respiratory rhythm; instead, this center functions to fine-tune the respiratory rhythm, receiving afferent input from the vagus nerve regarding Pao\n2, Paco\n2, and pulmonary inflation.",

In horses, the first part of inhalation following exhalation is passive until the relaxation volume is reached, at which point the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles complete the inspiratory phase. Contraction of the diaphragm forces the abdominal contents back, increasing the length of the thoracic cavity, and pulls the ribs abaxially, increasing the width of the abdominal cavity. In addition, the external intercostal muscles participate in inspiration by pulling the ribs abaxially to increase the width of the thoracic cavity. The net effect is an increase in the size of the thoracic cavity, producing subatmospheric intrathoracic pressure that drives inspiration and pulmonary inflation. In most species, expiration at rest is a passive process and relies on elastic recoil of the lung to create positive intrathoracic pressure.256 This is the case during the first portion of expiration in horses, which relies on elastic recoil to the point of relaxation volume, when the tendency for pulmonary collapse equals the tendency for expansion by the thoracic wall. Horses then further decrease lung volume by active compression of the chest wall through contraction of the internal intercostal muscles and muscles of the abdominal wall.278 The passive phase of inhalation follows. Dysfunction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles due to either mechanical (abdominal distention, trauma to the thoracic wall) or neuromuscular (botulism, phrenic nerve damage, nutritional myodegeneration) problems prevents expansion of the thoracic wall and can produce hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress.255, 257 Horses with torsion of the large colon can develop significant abdominal distention and respiratory distress, and respiratory failure caused by impaired diaphragmatic function can play an important role in the pathophysiology and mortality associated with this intestinal accident.",

            "text": "The diameter of the conducting airways, which is primarily controlled by the autonomic nervous system, is an important determinant of the degree of pulmonary resistance and work of breathing.256 The control of airway diameter by the autonomic nervous system involves both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation with activation of adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, respectively.256, 279, 280, 281 The receptors are generally widely expressed in the lung, although the pattern of specific receptor expression can vary among species. The control of normal airway function and airway diameter is complex, requiring interactions or \u201ccrosstalk\u201d between receptors. Vagal-mediated parasympathetic stimulation is important in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone, and stimulation can cause bronchoconstriction as well as mucus secretion and bronchial vasodilation. Specifically, bronchoconstriction can occur due to the action of acetylcholine from parasympathetic fibers on M3 muscarinic receptors located on airway smooth muscle. This mechanism of bronchoconstriction has been associated with allergic airway disease in several species. The administration of anticholinergics such as atropine or N-butylscopolammonium bromide can result in rapid relief of bronchoconstriction in some horses with RAO, demonstrating the important role of parasympathetic bronchoconstriction in the pathogenesis of this disorder.257, 259, 282, 283 With regard to sympathetic effects, both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors are found in the lung.28, 29, 30 However, direct sympathetic innervation of airway smooth muscle is minimal to none, and thus stimulation of the adrenergic receptors is primarily via circulating catecholamines.279, 280, 281 \u03b22-Adrenergic receptors are abundant throughout the lung on multiple cell types, including bronchial smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, and several immune cells, and thus activation can have multiple effects. The stimulation of \u03b22-receptors on airway smooth muscle can cause smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Airways must be constricted for \u03b22-receptor stimulation or the anticholinergic action of atropine to increase airway diameter.284, 285 \u03b22-Receptors appear to be present in normal or increased numbers on asthmatic airway smooth muscle but appear to be hyporesponsive, thus allowing bronchoconstriction.281, 286 \u03b21-Adrenergic receptors are less abundant than \u03b22-receptors in the airways. The effects of both \u03b21- and \u03b11-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of airway diameter in horses appear to be minimal.285, 286, 287\n",

Dysfunction of the NANC system may play a role in asthma in both people and horses, although the precise role remains to be elucidated.

For instance, if Paco\n2 increases from 40 to 80 mm Hg, the Pao\n2 decreases from 100 to 60 mm Hg. Therefore hypoxemia resulting from hypoventilation is rarely life threatening. In addition, oxygen supplementation easily abolishes hypoxemia caused by pure hypoventilation. Acidosis caused by hypercapnia is the most clinically significant feature of hypoventilation and may be life threatening.256 Metabolic alkalosis or central nervous system depression (e.g., from head trauma, encephalitis, narcotic drugs) can produce hypoventilation; however, horses with these disorders may not demonstrate clinical signs of respiratory distress. Disorders that can cause alveolar hypoventilation that are often associated with clinical signs of respiratory distress include dysfunction of the respiratory muscles from mechanical (abdominal distention, trauma to the thoracic wall) or neuromuscular (botulism, phrenic nerve damage, nutritional myodegeneration) conditions, restrictive pulmonary disease (silicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumothorax, pleural effusion), and upper airway obstruction.255, 257, 259\n",

Pulmonary regions that are overperfused in relation to ventilation (low V-Q ratio) contribute disproportionate amounts of blood with low arterial oxygen content to the systemic circulation.256 Respiratory diseases characterized by low V-Q ratios include RAO, pulmonary atelectasis, and consolidation.259 If ventilation exceeds perfusion (high V-Q ratio), the ventilated pulmonary units are inefficient for CO2 elimination and O2 uptake. Ventilation of poorly or nonperfused units is wasted ventilation, termed alveolar dead space.\n256 Conditions associated with high V-Q ratios include pulmonary thromboembolism and shock (low pulmonary artery pressure). Patients with V-Q mismatch often have a normal arterial Pco\n2. The ventilatory drive to maintain normal Paco\n2 is powerful, and as the CO2 dissociation curve is basically a straight line (direct relationship), increased ventilation efficiently decreases Paco\n2 at high and low V-Q ratios. However, also due to the nearly flat shape of the O2 dissociation curve, increasing ventilation is inefficient for proportionally increasing the arterial Po\n2. Only pulmonary units with moderate to low V-Q ratios benefit from increased ventilation. Therefore the increased ventilatory effort to maintain normal Paco\n2 is wasted and unnecessarily increases the work of breathing. Oxygen supplementation tends to increase Paco\n2 in patients with a V-Q mismatch. Also, elevation in arterial O2 is delayed compared with hypoventilation and in some cases may be incomplete.256 Compensatory mechanisms are present to minimize unequal distribution of ventilation and perfusion in diseased lungs to prevent the development of hypoxemia until the pulmonary pathologic condition is severe.256 Reflex pulmonary arterial constriction (hypoxic vasoconstriction) prevents perfusion of unventilated alveolar units and attempts to redirect blood flow to alveoli that are ventilated adequately. Airway hypocapnia causes bronchoconstriction of airways that conduct to unperfused alveolar units, redirecting air flow to better perfused alveoli.",

Physiologic shunting is defined as perfusion of nonventilated or collapsed regions of the lung and occurs with pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, and edema. Certain congenital heart diseases, such as tetralogy of Fallot and some cardiac septal defects, are examples of direct right-to-left shunts wherein unoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart is added to oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart. Right-to-left shunting may also contribute to hypoxemia in some cases of persistent pulmonary hypertension. In these conditions hypoxemia cannot be abolished by increasing the oxygen content of inspired air. The shunted blood is never exposed to the higher concentration of inspired oxygen in the alveolus, and the addition of a small amount of shunted blood with its low O2 content greatly reduces the Po\n2 of arterial blood. Compared with breathing room air, the decrement in Po\n2 is much greater at Po\n2 levels associated with the inhalation of O2-enriched air because the O2 dissociation curve is so flat at high Po\n2 levels. Only hypoxemia caused by right-to-left shunting behaves in this manner when the patient is permitted to inspire high percentages of oxygen (70%\u2013100%). Shunts do not usually cause hypercapnia.256 Chemoreceptors detect excess arterial CO2, and ventilation increases to reduce the content of CO2 in unshunted blood until arterial Pco\n2 reaches the normal range. In some cases of shunt the arterial Pco\n2 is below normal because of hyperventilation stimulated by the hypoxemic ventilatory drive.",

Diseases characterized by pure diffusion impairment are rare in veterinary medicine.259 However, some degree of diffusion impairment can occur with disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia, silicosis, or pulmonary edema and is most often associated with increased width of the barrier or decreased surface area available for gas exchange. Although the major component of hypoxemia in these conditions is a V-Q mismatch, diffusion impairment can contribute to the severity of hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen therapy is effective in treating hypoxemia caused by diffusion impairment because it creates a more favorable concentration gradient and increases the driving pressure of oxygen to move from the alveolus into the blood. Transport of CO2 is less affected by diseases of diffusion impairment because of its greater solubility compared with O2.256\n",

During pulmonary inflation intrathoracic pressures are subatmospheric. Small airways are pulled open by negative intrathoracic pressure and stretched parenchymal attachments at high lung volumes. Thus resistance to air flow in small airways is low during the inspiratory phase of respiration.256 During exhalation intrathoracic pressure is positive and the diameter of small airways is decreased, and bronchioles may even close at low lung volumes. Therefore resistance to air flow in small airways is greatest during the expiratory phase. In horses with RAO the airway diameter is reduced by inflammatory exudate, edema, and bronchoconstriction.257, 259, 290 As lung volume decreases during expiration, the narrowed bronchioles are compressed shut (dynamic airway collapse) and trap air distal to the site of closure.259 This is an example of severe flow limitation, which may lead ultimately to the development of emphysema. Flow limitation forces horses with RAO to breathe at higher lung volumes and maintain a higher functional residual capacity to reduce or prevent dynamic airway collapse. Affected horses attempt to reduce the end-expiratory lung volume by recruiting abdominal muscles to increase the intrathoracic pressures during expiration. However, the greater the end-expiratory pressure, the greater is the likelihood of small airway compression and collapse. Hypertrophy of the cutaneous trunci and expiratory abdominal muscles, especially the external abdominal oblique, produces the characteristic \u201cheave line\u201d associated with RAO.259 Because dynamic airway narrowing and collapse occur during exhalation, wheezes are typically loudest at end expiration in horses with RAO.257, 259\n",

The characteristic respiratory pattern in horses with restrictive pulmonary disease is rapid, shallow respiration at low lung volumes.259 This strategy takes advantage of high pulmonary compliance at low lung volumes and decreases the work of breathing. This respiratory pattern has the disadvantage of increased ventilation of anatomic dead space.256 Restrictive diseases may be classified as intrapulmonary (pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis, and interstitial pneumonia) and extrapulmonary (pleural effusion, pneumothorax, mediastinal mass, botulism, and nutritional myodegeneration).255, 259 Hypoxemia observed in horses with intrapulmonary restrictive disease is largely attributed to V-Q mismatch and diffusion impairment, although hypoventilation may also have a role. Stimulation of juxtacapillary receptors may contribute to respiratory distress observed in these patients.256 The pathophysiologic mechanism for hypoxemia in horses with extrapulmonary restriction is hypoventilation.259 In horses with pleural effusion and pneumothorax, respiratory distress is likely to be exacerbated by thoracic pain.",

Prolonged inspiration is consistent with restrictive or extrathoracic, nonfixed, obstructive disease, whereas horses with intrathoracic airway obstruction exhibit expiratory difficulty.256, 257 Respiratory distress associated with inspiration and expiration may indicate an extrathoracic fixed obstruction. Stertor is a low-pitched, \u201csnoring\u201d respiratory noise caused by partial obstruction above the larynx and is inspiratory. In comparison, stridor is a more musical sound that is generated by obstruction of the larynx and less frequently the trachea or bronchi.

Airway narrowing and exudate generate audible sounds by creating disturbances in laminar flow, turbulence, and sudden changes in pressure of moving gas.256 Crackles are intermittent or explosive sounds, generated by bubbling of air through secretions or by equilibration of airway pressures after sudden opening of collapsed small airways. The generation of crackles requires an air-fluid interface, and these abnormal lung sounds occur in horses with pneumonia, interstitial fibrosis, RAO, pulmonary edema, and atelectasis.246, 259 Wheezes are continuous, musical sounds that originate from oscillation of small airway walls before complete closing (expiratory wheeze) or opening (inspiratory wheeze).256 Expiratory wheezes are the hallmark of obstructive pulmonary disease.256\n",

Currently, for most viral respiratory tract infections, the most common means of diagnosis is detection of viral genetic material by PCR from a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab. For strangles, PCR and/or culture of a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash, guttural pouch wash, or abscess can be diagnostic. Several techniques have been described for sampling the lower airways of horses including transtracheal aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage, and various transendoscopic procedures. Thoracocentesis can be useful in cases of suspected pleuropneumonia and in some cases of suspected neoplasia. For the diagnosis of RAO, cytologic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is recommended and is typically characterized by a significant increase in neutrophils (greater than 25%).

For a given hydrostatic and oncotic pressure difference, tissues with higher filtration coefficients (whether because of a larger capillary surface area or more porous capillaries) will have a greater fluid flux. Conversely, under the same circumstance, increases in the reflection coefficient will reduce solute movement across the capillary wall, affecting the osmotic pressure gradient and reducing fluid flux. The differential permeability of the capillary membrane to water and protein has important consequences in the maintenance of the oncotic pressure difference between plasma and interstitial fluid. Multiple factors influence the movement of fluid and solutes across the endothelium, including the concentration of the solutes on either side of the membrane, solute charge and interaction with other solutes, and capillary pore configuration.322\n",

Lymphatic endothelial cells are supported, and the lymphatic capillaries maintained patent, by anchoring filaments that attach the endothelial cells to surrounding connective tissue. Lymphatic fluid progresses centripetally through progressively larger vessels before draining into the great veins of the chest. Lymphatic valves prevent the retrograde flow of fluid from the lymphatics. Lymph is propelled by factors extrinsic to the lymphatics, including muscle activity, active and passive motion, posture, respiration, and blood vessel pulsation. Exercise increases lymph flow, at least in part because of the increase in tissue pressure that is associated with muscle contraction, although passive motion also increases lymph flow. In human beings, standing results in significant diminution or cessation of lymph flow from the lower extremities, which can result in the accumulation of interstitial fluid and edema.

The condition can occur in any limb but is more common in the hindlimbs. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although culture is frequently unrewarding. Some cases of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection manifest as an ulcerative lymphangitis.344 Chronic progressive lymphedema is a condition recognized in some draft horse breeds including Clydesdales, Shires, and Belgians.345 The condition is thought to be caused by altered elastin metabolism leading to impaired lymphatic function. Affected horses have chronic lymphedema with swelling of the distal limbs and development of fibrosis. Massive envenomation by bees (bee stings) causes generalized edema in horses.346 Snake envenomation can also cause edema.347\n",

Causes of noncardiovascular syncope include primarily neurologic and metabolic disorders. One cause of noncardiogenic syncope in people is orthostatic or postural hypotension, which is defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure or 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of changing position from sitting or supine to standing.350, 351, 352 It results from an inadequate physiologic response to postural changes and has been associated with an impairment of peripheral vasoconstriction or reduction of intravascular volume. Specific causes of syncope related to orthostatic hypotension include dehydration or blood loss, as well as a variety of neurologic, cardiovascular, and endocrine disorders. Another type of noncardiogenic syncope is neurally mediated syncope, which is associated with disturbances of reflex cardiovascular control.350, 351, 353, 354 Some cases of neurally mediated syncope are associated with pain, stresss, or specific triggers. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not fully understood, it is characterized by peripheral vasodilation and/or transient bradycardia that is associated with inappropriate triggering of neural reflexes. In some but not all cases, neurally mediated syncope is associated with concurrent cardiac disease. The most common form of neurally mediated syncope is neurocardiogenic or vasovagal syncope, in which there is an increase in vagal parasympathetic tone and a decrease in sympathetic tone that results in bradycardia and hypotension associated with peripheral vasodilation.353, 354 In two cases of presumptive neurocardiogenic syncope in horses, no bradycardia was noted before collapse, suggesting a purely vasodepressor response in those cases.348 Some other forms of neurally mediated syncope that have been recognized in people include carotid sinus syndrome, postmicturition syncope, and swallow syncope.",

In horses, signs such as stumbling, head elevation, or anxiousness can precede collapse, but in most cases there are little or no premonitory warning signs.355 The collapse is associated with a transient comatose state followed by recovery. Horses may struggle during recovery but are normal thereafter unless they sustain significant trauma during the episode.

Although occasionally depolarizations in the brainstem and thalamus can result in seizures, these depolarizations are projected to the cortex.

Also, neuronal function is influenced by the ionic environment, including concentrations of sodium, chloride, calcium, and potassium. A variety of neurotransmitters are present, including both excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, aspartate, and acetylcholine, and also inhibitory neurotransmitters such as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, glycine, taurine, and norepinephrine. Several hormones and neurosteroids can influence epileptogenesis, having variable effects depending on the substance.361 Any alterations in the complex neuronal environment can potentiate seizures. For example, hypoglycemia can result in a loss of energy substrate for the Na+-K+ ATPase pump, causing cells to move toward lower positivity and allowing excessive excitation. In hepatoencephalopathy, there may be a decrease in the function of inhibitory neurotransmitters, resulting in a lack of inhibition and unregulated depolarization. Multiple factors contribute to the development of seizures associated with traumatic brain injury, infection, or neoplasia including neuronal loss, altered cellular metabolism and blood flow, and neuroinflammation, among others.358, 359, 360, 361, 362\n",

In humans, the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy has developed a comprehensive scheme for the classification of seizures to more accurately describe seizures and develop a systematic approach to their diagnosis and treatment.363 Efforts have been made to similarly classify seizures in horses.364, 365 The term epilepsy is defined as two or more seizures that occur in more than 24 hours regardless of the cause. Seizures can be described as either focal or generalized, both of which have been described in horses. Focal seizures, which have previously been referred to as partial, represent a focal area of abnormal discharge within the brain and result in localized motor signs or sensations. Focal seizures can be further categorized as simple, if alertness and normal mentation are maintained, and complex, if impairment of consciousness is present. Generalized seizures involve the entire cerebral cortex and typically result in generalized bilateral motor activity and loss of consciousness. Generalized seizures can be primary, meaning they are generalized from the outset, or secondary, meaning they progress from a focal seizure. Seizures can also be classified by the cause. Reactive seizures are those in which the seizure is a result of a temporary systemic disease with normal brain function such as seizures seen in association with acute hemorrhage or hypoglycemia. Other causes of seizures have been grouped as follows: (1) symptomatic, in which there is a documented structural brain disorder such as brain damage from trauma or hypoxia, congenital anomalies, neoplasia, and infection, including meningitis, encephalitis, and abscessation; (2) cryptogenic, in which symptomatic causes are suspected but cannot be documented; and (3) idiopathic, in which there are no underlying structural or metabolic abnormalities and there is a suspected genetic predisposition.",

Focal seizures may involve the face or body and some of the more common signs include ear or lip twitching, tongue prolapse, opening and closing of jaw, compulsive kicking, head turning to one side, and tremors.364 In some cases, impaired consciousness and behavior changes have also been reported. Generalized seizures are typically characterized by tonic-clonic motor activity. Eye globe deviation and nystagmus are common. Vocalization and autonomic disturbances such as mydriasis, urination, defecation, and profuse sweating have also been reported. Affected horses may have generalized rigidity or a loss of muscle tone. Postictal signs have also been reported in horses. In the study of 104 horses with seizures, 31% of horses affected by complex focal or generalized seizures had postictal signs typically lasting from minutes to hours.364 These signs included ataxia, disorientation, lethargy, agitation, blindness, hypersensitivity, and shallow breathing.",

The sleep cycle is disrupted, and people with narcolepsy frequently enter REM sleep at the onset of sleep rather than later in the sleep cycle. Both sporadic and familial forms of narcolepsy have been identified in humans, dogs, and horses.370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379 The pathophysiology of narcolepsy remains unclear and may vary among species and individuals. It appears to be a complex biochemical disorder affecting several regions of the brain (brainstem, hypothalamus, limbic system, and possibly the striatum and cortex) with dysfunction of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitters.372, 381 Defective hypocretin signaling has been described in both familial and sporadic narcolepsy in some species.371, 372, 373, 382 Hypocretin 1 and 2, also known as orexins, are neuropeptides that appear to be specifically expressed in certain hypothalamic neurons. They appear to have an important role in the regulation of sleep and arousal states, as well as appetite. In some dog breeds, a familial form of narcolepsy has been identified in association with a mutation in hypocretin-2 receptor gene.374 In these dogs, hypocretin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is normal. In humans, narcolepsy is only rarely associated with mutations in the hypocretin receptor gene. In both humans and dogs, the sporadic form of narcolepsy has been associated with decreased hypocretin concentration in the CSF. Many cases of narcolepsy in people are linked to the human leukocyte antigen, and an autoimmune component may play a role in the development of disease. It has been postulated that there is an immune-mediated destruction of hypothalamic neurons producing hypocretin, resulting in a progressive decline in the concentration of hypocretin. The role of hypocretin in equine narcolepsy is currently uncertain. The concentration of hypocretin in the CSF of an Icelandic foal with narcolepsy without cataplexy was similar to controls, although it was speculated that concentrations could decrease over time.377 Occasionally secondary narcolepsy may develop after disease or organic insult to the brain, such as following traumatic brain injury.383, 384\n",

Confirmation of neurocardiogenic syncope would require ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Polycythemia and upper airway obstruction have also been reported to cause syncopal episodes.387, 388\n",

The clinical presentation of the seizure appears to be independent of the underlying cause, reflecting the area and extent of the cerebral cortex involved.364 In the study evaluating 104 horses with seizures, 2 horses were found to have reactive seizures not associated with abnormal brain function. These horses were diagnosed with liver failure and severe acute systemic hemorrhage. The remaining 102 horses were felt to have underlying brain disease, although a specific diagnosis was not always possible. Of these, 28% had a single seizure episode and 70% had two or more seizures and were diagnosed with epilepsy. Of those horses with a single seizure episode, an underlying structural brain lesion was confirmed or suspected in 16 of 29 horses, with acute head trauma being the most common (6 of 16). In those horses with epilepsy, the condition was categorized as symptomatic in 35.6% of cases and cryptogenic in 54.8%, and 2 foals were diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. Overall there was no breed, age, or gender association in horses with epilepsy, although juvenile idiopathic epilepsy is seen in Arabian foals. Specific causes of symptomatic seizures that were identified included skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, neoplasia, cholesterol granuloma, vasculitis, meningoencephalitis, abscessation, intracranial vascular events, leukoencephalomalacia, congenital abnormalities, and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM). The presence of ear ticks has rarely been associated with seizures.355 Meningoencephalitis due to infection with the nematode Halicephalobus gingivalis has been associated with multiple neurologic deficits, including seizures.389 Neonatal foals have a lower seizure threshold than adults, and seizures have been reported in association with sepsis, neonatal encephalopathy, and electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia.355, 390, 391, 392 Hypoglycemia may cause seizures but is more often associated with weakness and lethargy. Hyperbilirubinemic encephalopathy (kernicterus) may rarely occur in foals.",

            "text": "Normal eating and drinking are complex neuromuscular activities that are initiated with the uptake of material into the oral cavity.401, 402, 403 The process of swallowing allows the transport of this material from the oral cavity to the stomach while protecting the airway. The initial stage of swallowing is the oral phase, which encompasses the formation and positioning of a feed bolus, which is defined as feed that is of suitable size and consistency to be swallowed. Mastication and moistening by saliva lead to formation of the bolus and also initiate digestion by mechanical breakdown of the feed and addition of digestive enzymes from saliva. The bolus is moved to the base of the tongue, where coordinated movements of the tongue and pharynx initiate the pharyngeal phase of swallowing. The oropharynx relaxes and the soft palate elevates to seal the palatopharyngeal arch and nasopharynx. As the bolus enters the oropharynx, the hyoid apparatus moves rostrodorsally, drawing the larynx and common pharynx forward while at the same time the epiglottis tips caudally to prevent the bolus from entering the larynx. The bolus is moved through the pharynx by sequential contraction of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles along with some driving force from the tongue. The lower portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, known as the cricopharyngeus, is the major muscle in the upper esophageal sphincter. At the end of the pharyngeal stage of the swallow, this muscle relaxes, allowing the bolus to enter the esophagus, and then contracts to prevent oroesophageal reflux and aerophagia. As the bolus enters the esophagus, the esophagus, including the lower esophageal sphincter, relaxes and the bolus is propelled toward the stomach by primary peristaltic waves. Gravity can assist in moving a liquid bolus toward the stomach. After the bolus enters the stomach, the lower esophageal sphincter contracts to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. Any minor reflux that does occur is typically cleared by secondary peristaltic waves, which are waves that occur in the thoracic esophagus without an associated pharyngeal contraction. Active antiperistalsis does not normally occur in horses, and thus horses generally do not actively vomit. All of the activity involved in swallowing occurs relatively rapidly. In herbivores, breathing can continue uninterrupted during swallowing.",

Once feed is in the oral cavity and oropharynx, peripheral receptors stimulate the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves providing sensory input to the brainstem, which leads to activation of the swallowing reflex. Patterned discharges of excitation and inhibition are sent from neurons in the swallowing center to motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, resulting in swallowing. Swallowing can also be initiated by stimulation of cortical neurons, and often cortical and peripheral inputs act together in eliciting swallowing. Once swallowing is initiated, continuing sensory input modulates motor activity.",

Pharyngeal collapse may be seen with enlargement of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes, most often due to abscessation associated with Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, as well as with severe guttural pouch disease, including empyema, mycosis, or tympany, and occasionally neoplasia.405, 406, 421, 422, 423, 424 Pharyngeal collapse is often associated with dyspnea, as well as dysphagia. Oral neoplasms of either dental or nondental origin are relatively uncommon but can cause pain or act as a space-occupying mass resulting in dysphagia.405, 406, 425, 426 A number of dental tumors, as well as osteogenic tumors of nondental origin, such as osteomas, ossifying fibromas, and osteochondromas, have been described. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common soft tissue neoplasm reported in the oral cavity, but others have been identified, including melanoma and lymphosarcoma. Adenocarcinoma of the tongue and epiglottis has been reported as a cause of severe dysphagia in a horse.427 Snakebite may cause severe edema of the head and dysphagia.347, 428\n",

The dorsolateral wall of the medial compartment of the guttural pouch contains several nerves, including the glossopharyngeal (IX); branches of the vagus (X), spinal accessory (XI), and hypoglossal nerves (XII); and the cranial cervical ganglion. In addition, a small portion of the facial nerve (VII) is located in the dorsal wall of the lateral compartment. Thus guttural pouch disease can result in pharyngeal dysfunction, dysphagia, and occasionally other neurologic signs such as laryngeal paralysis, Horner\u2019s syndrome, and facial paralysis.404, 405, 424, 429, 430, 431, 406 Important diseases of the guttural pouch causing dysphagia include guttural pouch empyema and guttural pouch mycosis. Skull trauma resulting in rupture of the longus capitus muscle at the site of attachment to the basisphenoid bone may result in significant hemorrhage into the pouch, potentially affecting the cranial nerves.429 Occasionally flushing of the guttural pouch and surgical correction of guttural pouch tympany results in damage to the cranial nerves coursing through the pouch with consequent neurologic dysfunction.405, 406, 431 Although temporohyoid osteoarthropathy most often results in deficits of the facial (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) nerves, occasionally deficits of the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (X) nerves occur, resulting in dysphagia.432, 433 Lead toxicity may result in a peripheral neuropathy with dysphagia.434 Some horses with polyneuritis equi, an inflammatory condition affecting primarily the cauda equina, will have involvement of the cranial nerves and present with cranial nerve signs including dysphagia, occasionally even before the development of signs related to cauda equina dysfunction.435, 436\nBOX 7.9Functional Causes of DysphagiaPeripheral Nerve Disease\nGuttural pouch disease affecting the cranial nervesEmpyema, mycosisTympanyHemorrhage associated with rupture of the longus capitusNeoplasia\nTemporohyoid osteoarthropathyLead poisoningPolyneuritis equi\nCentral Neurologic Disease\nViral encephalitis/encephalomyelitisRabiesEastern, western, and Venezuelan encephalitis (EEE, WEE, VEE)West Nile virus (WNV)Equine herpes myeloencephalopathy\nEquine protozoal myeloencephalitisToxicityNigropallidal encephalomalaciaLeukoencephalomalacia\nTraumaTetanusMigrating parasitesEquine grass sicknessAffects central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems\nPharyngeal dysfunction in neonatal foals\nNeuromuscular Disease\nBotulismTetanusOrganophosphate toxicityPrimarily acute cholinergic signs, dysphagia rare\nTick paralysis\nMuscle Disease\nNutritional myodegeneration (white muscle disease)Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis\n",

Some important central neurologic diseases that can be associated with dysphagia include viral encephalitis (rabies, eastern and western encephalitis, West Nile virus, equine herpesvirus), equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, toxic neuropathies (leukoencephalomalacia and nigropallidal encephalomalacia), tetanus, cerebral trauma, and rarely migrating parasites.404, 405, 406, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441 Dysphagia is a relatively common finding in horses affected with rabies.404 Horses with nigropallidal encephalomalacia have lesions of the basal ganglia and can swallow but are unable to prehend feed as they lack coordination of the lips and tongue. Tetanus toxin acts at several sites within the nervous system, including the inhibitory interneurons in the central nervous system and the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle paralysis.442 It typically results in increased tonus of the masticatory muscles, known as trismus, and dysphagia. The mouth may be difficult to open, thus the term lockjaw. Some cases of marked hypocalcemia may result in tetany and dysphagia. A syndrome of dysphagia related to presumed pharyngeal dysfunction has been reported in neonatal foals.443 Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, some affected foals were premature and/or diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy. Other central neurologic problems that may potentially cause dysphagia include bacterial or fungal meningitis and intracranial masses.",

Equine grass sickness (EGS), also referred to as equine dysautonomia, is a largely fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting the peripheral, central, and enteric nervous systems of grazing equids.446, 447, 448 The gastrointestinal tract is the most severely affected body system, with the predominant clinical signs being colic, weight loss, and dysphagia. Although the disease primarily occurs within Great Britain, cases have been identified in regions of mainland Europe and rarely in other locations including the United States.

Observing the horse while eating, and if possible drinking, can be valuable. Some horses can continue to drink despite difficulty swallowing feed whereas others cannot. Offering feed may help distinguish dysphagia from anorexia. Depending on the underlying cause, many dysphagic horses are hungry and will attempt to eat. Some horses, such as those with retropharyngeal abscessation due to strangles, may have both dysphagia and a decreased appetite. Observation of eating can also help determine the phase of eating affected, which can help in prioritizing differentials. In cases where prehension is primarily affected, nigropallidal encephalomalacia should be considered in areas where yellow star thistle or Russian knapweed is present. Dropping feed while chewing is consistent with abnormal mastication, which is often associated with dental disease. The regurgitation of feed through the nares while eating is generally associated with pharyngeal or esophageal disorders rather than oral cavity problems. Those horses with feed in the nares are at increased risk of aspiration of feed material, and coughing or increased respiratory rate and effort may be seen.

The neurologic examination helps establish a neuroanatomic localization. In general, horses with dysphagia due to peripheral neurologic disease may exhibit only dysphagia, whereas those with central neurologic or neuromuscular disease tend to have additional deficits. For example, the presence of generalized weakness in association with dysphagia often suggests a neuromuscular problem, such as botulism or organophosphate toxicity.404, 405, 406, 444, 445 Equine motor neuron disease results in generalized weakness and muscle atrophy; however, affected horses do not exhibit cranial nerve deficits and are not dysphagic.454 Tetanus causes spastic paralysis and can present with a variety of signs, including dysphagia, hyperesthesia, and prolapse of third eyelid, in addition to a stiff gait, which may progress to recumbency.442 Spinal ataxia associated with dysphagia suggests a diffuse or multifocal disease affecting the spinal cord and brainstem, such as equine protozoal myelitis, rabies, equine herpes myeloencephalopathy, or a migrating parasite.437, 438, 439, 440 Viral encephalitis should be considered in dysphagic horses with mentation changes, especially if the horse is febrile. Horses with polyneuritis equi occasionally have cranial nerve involvement in addition to the classic signs of cauda equina involvement, which include slowly progressive paralysis of the tail, rectum, anus, and bladder.435, 436 Affected horses may also have ataxia and weakness of the hindlimbs.",

Damage to the mucosa can be assessed on a scale of Grade I through Grade V, with Grade V being the most severe.462 The villous tips are especially sensitive to ischemia, and damage typically begins there. Crypt cells are affected later as the ischemia becomes more complete and longer in duration. In the equine colon complete ischemia leads to necrosis and detachment of surface epithelial cells and most likely to capillary thrombosis and occlusion.462 Smooth muscle is less sensitive to hypoxia, and therefore it is destruction of the mucosa that is the main factor leading to the pathologic changes associated with colic.",

Other risk factors include inadequate deworming or dentistry, exposure to sand, transport, changes in activity, previous colic episodes, and the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Colic has also been linked to stereotypic behaviors such as crib-biting, which has been shown in some studies to be associated with an increased risk of both colic in general and epiploic foramen entrapment.470, 474, 475, 476 It is important to remember that colic can occur regardless of management practices.",

            "text": "A thorough physical examination is essential to the evaluation of colic. It is important to assess the degree of pain, and in some cases the horse may be so uncomfortable initially that sedation will be necessary for safe completion of the examination. If possible, heart rate, respiratory rate, and auscultation of gut sounds should be evaluated before sedation because these can change significantly in response to sedation.497, 498 Because rectal temperature can also be significantly decreased after rectal palpation, it is advisable to obtain the body temperature before palpation.461 A finding of pyrexia may increase suspicion of colitis, enteritis, peritonitis, or intraabdominal abscessation in the patient, although previous administration of an NSAID may mask this clinical finding.462, 485, 486 Tachycardia can be an indicator of pain, hypovolemia, tachyarrhythmia, or endotoxemia, and rates of greater than 80 beats per minute generally indicate serious disease.462, 485, 486 During auscultation the patient should be evaluated for the presence of any cardiac abnormalities that would put the horse at increased risk under sedation. Respiratory rate may be increased in horses with colic as a response to some combination of pain, fever, and/or metabolic acidosis. Mucous membranes and capillary refill time (CRT) give a rough assessment of cardiovascular status and peripheral perfusion. Normal mucous membranes should be pink and moist with a CRT of less than 2 seconds. Tacky mucous membranes are generally observed with dehydration of at least 5% to 7%.485, 486 Prolonged CRT and either grayish or dark red mucous membranes indicate impaired cardiovascular status and poor perfusion. With poor perfusion, there may also be cool extremities and reduced jugular fill. Significant changes in mucous membrane color, often with a dark \u201ctoxic\u201d line adjacent to the teeth, may accompany endotoxemia, which is common in gastrointestinal disease, particularly in horses with colitis, proximal enteritis, and strangulating lesions. Icterus is relatively common in horses that have been off feed for more than 48 hours due to equine fasting hyperbilirubinemia. However, icterus may also be seen with hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Other important considerations during the physical examination include assessment of hydration status, attitude, abdominal distention, and the presence of injuries that indicate self-trauma, which often reflects the degree of pain. As previously mentioned, in stallions careful palpation of the inguinal region must be performed to identify an inguinal hernia or testicular torsion. Severe abdominal distention may markedly increase the respiratory effort and eventually lead to respiratory distress. Auscultation of abdominal quadrants (left dorsal, left ventral, right dorsal, right ventral) can give an estimation of gastrointestinal motility.485, 486 Assessing the abdomen for pings can help to localize gas. Auscultation of the most ventral part of the abdomen should also be performed to assess for the presence of sand.499 Although not always present, a characteristic \u201cwaves on the beach\u201d sound can sometimes be heard, indicating the presence of sand in the colon. If feces can be collected from the horse, it can be useful to evaluate for the presence of sand. A simple way to do this is to mix a few fecal balls with warm water in a rectal sleeve and hang the sleeve with the fingers down. After about 5 minutes any sand in the feces should sediment into the ends of the glove fingers.485\n",

            "text": "Additional diagnostics for horses with colic include rectal palpation, nasogastric intubation, and, in many cases, abdominocentesis. Adequate restraint is important for these procedures because not only is the veterinarian at increased risk of injury with an uncooperative horse, but the horse also is at increased risk of rectal tears, significant epistaxis, and abdominocentesis complications such as enterocentesis or contamination of the collection site. The most appropriate means of restraint is dependent on the individual patient and may include sedation and/or the application of a nose twitch. When selecting the method of restraint the safety of the examiner and the horse must be considered, while at the same time it is important to not further compromise an unstable patient or dramatically affect assessment of the horse\u2019s level of pain. Use of xylazine hydrochloride intravenously at 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg (typically 100\u2013250 mg for a 500-kg horse) is often adequate, but butorphanol tartrate at 0.01 to 0.08 mg/kg intravenously can be added when necessary.461 Use of detomidine is usually discouraged in the initial management of colic because of its long duration of action and heightened ability to mask more significant pain that may affect determination of the horse\u2019s treatment.465, 466 However, if indicated, detomidine can be administered at 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly.461 It is most commonly used when a longer duration of sedation is required to keep a horse quiet during transport to a referral center.",

If a horse is exhibiting significant pain or has a heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute on initial evaluation, nasogastric intubation should be performed before other diagnostic procedures because it may have both diagnostic and therapeutic value. If a horse has significant gastric distention, gastric decompression may help prevent gastric rupture and decrease pain, allowing for a more thorough physical examination. The nasogastric tube can be left in place if a significant amount of net reflux is obtained to allow for repeated decompression. If no reflux is obtained and a simple colic is suspected, oral fluids with or without electrolytes or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) can be administered via the tube. Although mineral oil has long been considered a part of standard colic treatment, its use is controversial. Mineral oil may be valuable as a diagnostic tool, providing an estimate of gastrointestinal transit time. In a normal horse mineral oil can be observed in the feces and on the perineum and tail in 12 to 24 hours.500 The absence of mineral oil after this period may indicate delayed gastrointestinal transit. However, mineral oil can sometimes pass around an impaction that is present, thereby falsely suggesting adequate gastrointestinal transit when in fact digesta is not moving normally.500 In addition, if a horse ultimately requires abdominal surgery, the presence of mineral oil can complicate an enterotomy.501\n",

            "text": "Palpation per rectum can be important in the assessment of colic. Even with the use of appropriate sedation, some horses remain resistant to rectal examination, placing them at increased risk for rectal tears. To potentially improve the quality and safety of palpation per rectum, intravenous administration of N-butylscopolammonium can help to decrease rectal pressure and peristalsis.502 Application of lidocaine within the rectal lumen has also been used to facilitate palpation. Although rectal palpation can provide valuable diagnostic information, the presence or absence of a particular lesion cannot always be definitively determined. For instance, although a pelvic flexure or cecal impaction may be palpable, if no impaction is palpated, it cannot be ruled out. Additionally, gas distention might be palpable in gas colic, but it may also reflect a more serious problem, such as a displacement or torsion. Rectal palpation therefore can provide evidence to support a diagnosis but is often not diagnostic in itself. Nephrosplenic entrapment may be suspected if the spleen is displaced medially or the gut is palpated between the spleen and kidney.485, 486 Another useful finding is the identification of distended small intestine. Although small intestinal distention may occasionally occur secondary to a large intestinal problem such as a displacement, it is most often an indication of small intestinal disease. Although rectal palpation cannot differentiate a surgical small intestinal problem such as a strangulating lesion from a medical problem such as proximal enteritis, small intestinal disease is almost always an indication for referral.485, 486, 503 Therefore palpable loops of distended small intestine are a significant finding on rectal examination. Rectal palpation can also be useful for identifying masses in the abdomen, which may be a cause of chronic colic.",

Metabolic acidosis caused by elevation of lactate, loss of bicarbonate, or both may also be observed. Hyperglycemia is relatively common in horses with acute gastrointestinal disease in association with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Significant elevations in glucose have been associated with a worse prognosis for hospital discharge.506 Occasionally, hepatic enzyme activities are increased, especially \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT). This most commonly occurs with right dorsal displacement of the large colon or proximal enteritis.507, 508 In a study of horses with large colon displacements, 49% of horses with right dorsal displacements had concentrations of GGT above the reference range compared with 1% of horses with left dorsal displacements.508 Dehydration often results in elevations in creatinine and serum urea nitrogen, and these parameters should be monitored, especially when NSAIDs or aminoglycoside antibiotics are used. Elevations in muscle enzymes are common in horses with colic. In a study of horses undergoing celiotomy for acute gastrointestinal pain, elevations in creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity were significantly associated with the presence of lesions resulting in intestinal ischemia.509\n",

Also, ultrasound of the abdomen can be used to identify pockets of fluid, but it should be remembered that fluid can often still be obtained even when a significant volume of fluid is not apparent on ultrasound. If severe gas distention or small intestinal distention is present, or if a sand enterocolitis is suspected, it may be advisable to forego abdominocentesis to avoid puncture of a distended compromised viscus or a heavy sand-filled viscus that is sitting flush with the ventral body wall. Although a practitioner may not have access to a full fluid analysis and cytology, a basic assessment of abdominal fluid can be made by visual evaluation for color and clarity, and total protein can be evaluated with a refractometer. Normal fluid should be odorless, nonturbid, and a clear to pale yellow color.462, 510, 511 Increased turbidity can indicate increased protein, increased total nucleated cell count, or both.

            "text": "Several basic mechanisms of diarrhea have been described, and in many diarrheal diseases more than one mechanism is involved. Inflammation within the bowel often plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea and may contribute to diarrhea via multiple mechanisms. Basic mechanisms of diarrhea include the following:1.\nMalabsorption: Malabsorption results from a decrease in the functional absorptive surface area of the gastrointestinal tract. In the small intestine, villus atrophy, such as that seen with rotaviral enteritis, equine proliferative enteropathy (Lawsonia intracellularis), and infiltrative bowel disease, can result in malabsorption because of the loss of functional epithelium and maldigestion caused by decreased production of digestive enzymes.142, 535, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 142,535,539-577 In the colon, a number of insults can result in inflammation and disruption of absorptive cells and tight junctions, leading to decreased absorptive capacity and decreased ability to retain absorbed fluid (i.e., increased loss). Several inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u03b1, histamines, and prostaglandins, can contribute to the colonic inflammation. These mediators are produced primarily by inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and inhibit absorption through a variety of mechanisms.542, 543, 544, 545, 546\n2.\nIncreased secretion: The increased secretion of solutes and water by the inflamed colon can contribute significantly to the development of diarrhea. Although the precise mechanisms of secretion in the equine colon are not understood fully, active secretion and passive fluid loss occur.542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549 Control of active secretion is complex, involving two primary pathways: first, the activation of adenyl cyclase, resulting in an increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations, and second, the activation of calcium channels, leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations.547, 548 Cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium stimulate specific secretory activities, primarily through chloride channels. In some cases of diarrhea, bacterial enterotoxins such as those produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. stimulate adenyl cyclase activity, thus increasing active secretion. This is true hypersecretory diarrhea. Also, a number of inflammatory mediators produced by the inflamed colon, particularly prostaglandin E2, increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and to some extent calcium, thereby increasing active secretion by mucosal cells.547, 548, 549 Inflammation also enhances passive fluid loss through a number of factors, such as changes in hydrostatic pressure in the colonic capillaries, mucosal damage, and loss of tight junctions. In horses with severe mucosal injury, the loss of protein can decrease vascular oncotic pressure and further potentiate fluid exchange across the endothelium.3.\nDecreased transit time (abnormal motility): Sufficient retention time and thorough mixing are required for digestion and absorption of nutrients and fluid to occur, and thus decreased intestinal transit time can contribute to diarrhea.532, 533, 534, 550 Primary motility disorders causing diarrhea are not well recognized, although diarrhea associated with stress or excitement may represent this phenomenon. However, it appears that secondary motility disorders are common in response to a variety of gastrointestinal problems, although the exact role that these changes in motility play in the pathogenesis of diarrhea is not entirely clear. Both inflammatory and infectious conditions may influence motility in addition to potentially altering absorption and secretion. Absorption of endotoxin and the release of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, disrupts normal motility patterns.551 In general, these changes result in hypermotility and decreased intestinal transit time, although hypomotility has been recognized as well. Some progressive motility must be present for diarrhea to occur. In some cases of acute colitis, a period of ileus may occur without diarrhea. This is usually transient and diarrhea develops, although occasionally ileus may persist. With diarrheal diseases, the elimination of gastrointestinal contents is part of the normal host defense mechanism, and thus treatments specifically aimed at decreasing motility are not indicated in most cases.4.\nOsmotic overload: Any increase in osmotically active particles within the intestinal lumen can result in diarrhea. The increase can be associated with the administration or ingestion of osmotically active substances such as magnesium sulfate. The increase also may be associated with overloading of the intestine with carbohydrates or occasionally lipids beyond the amount that can be digested and absorbed. Therefore sudden dietary changes that result in significant shifts in gut flora and changes in fermentation or gastrointestinal diseases that result in malabsorption or maldigestion also may result in an osmotic diarrhea. In foals the loss of villous epithelial cells in the small intestine associated with disorders such as rotavirus infection and clostridiosis may lead not only to malabsorption but also to maldigestion caused by the decreased production of lactase and secondary lactose intolerance.535, 539, 552 Although uncommon, primary lactose intolerance has also been reported in foals.553 Lactose intolerance allows excess lactose to enter the large intestine, increasing the osmotic load.5.\nIncreased hydraulic pressure from the blood to the lumen: The pressure change may result in increased fluid movement to the lumen and decreased net fluid absorption. This mechanism of diarrhea is more common in chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure or inflammatory bowel disease. The condition may result from decreased oncotic pressure associated with hypoproteinemia, increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (as in heart failure), or decreased lymphatic drainage associated with inflammation of lymphatics and lymph nodes.\n",

Although primarily a respiratory pathogen, Rhodococcus equi also can cause diarrhea, particularly in foals 2 to 4 months of age.566\nEscherichia coli is an uncommon cause of diarrhea in foals, unlike in calves and piglets.

Attention should be given to good biosecurity measures, especially as some causes of equine diarrhea are potentially zoonotic in addition to being transmissible among horses. The body condition of the horse and the presence of any edema should be noted. The presence of fever, dehydration, or signs of endotoxemia may help in assessing the severity of the disease and differentiating the cause because some causes of diarrhea are not typically associated with systemic signs of illness. The presence of oral ulcers and synchronous diaphragmatic flutter increase the likelihood of cantharidin toxicity especially in horses being fed alfalfa.590 In horses presented for diarrhea with a concurrent arrhythmia, oleander toxicity should be considered if exposure is possible.593 Careful evaluation of the abdomen should be performed. Visible abdominal distention is often an indication of large intestinal distention, which may occur in association with acute colitis. However, distention also may be visible with extreme dilation of multiple loops of small intestine. Careful auscultation of the abdomen can be useful in assessing motility. Although the frequency of borborygmi in horses is variable, horses with normal motility generally have 1 to 3 borborygmi in a 60-second time period. Auscultation behind the xiphoid process may help identify the presence of sand or gravel if particles can be heard grinding together during contractions of the colon.499 Percussion of the abdomen while ausculting may help to identify high-pitched resonant sounds associated with gas-distended bowel. Particularly in foals, transabdominal palpation and ballottement may be useful to identify increased abdominal fluid or large masses near the body wall. Transrectal palpation can be helpful in assessing the size of intestinal segments, consistency of contents, and wall thickness, as well as in identifying masses, enlarged lymph nodes, or mesenteric arteritis.",

However, blood work is often important in directing appropriate supportive care and may help to establish whether diarrhea is caused by another condition, such as hepatic or renal disease. Some important parameters to evaluate include the presence of leukopenia, particularly neutropenia with a left shift, and toxic changes in the white blood cells. These abnormalities suggest a systemic inflammatory response, often associated with endotoxemia. Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies may also be present. The clinician also should evaluate the concentration of protein, as well as the albumin-to-globulin ratio. Both acute and chronic diarrhea can cause significant protein loss, resulting in hypoproteinemia and particularly hypoalbuminemia. Hyperglobulinemia may indicate a chronic inflammatory condition. Disturbances in acid-base balance, especially metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities frequently occur in horses with acute diarrhea but are uncommon with chronic diarrhea. Although hypocalcemia is relatively common in horses with colitis, marked hypocalcemia may be suggestive of possible cantharidin toxicity.63 Because of the dehydration frequently seen with acute diarrhea, prerenal azotemia is common and is important to recognize because some therapies, especially NSAIDs, may worsen the condition. In a study of 122 horses with acute diarrhea, horses with azotemia and clinicopathologic findings consistent with hemoconcentration and hypoproteinemia were less likely to survive.599\n",

Frank blood in the feces suggests bleeding into the distal colon from mucosal damage. Hemorrhagic, foul-smelling feces often are seen in association with clostridial diarrhea. The clinician also can assess the feces for the presence of occult blood, which indicates bleeding from any source. Although excess sand in the feces is readily apparent in some cases, other cases require mixing the feces in a rectal sleeve with water and allowing the sand to settle. Acorn husks may be present in the feces of horses with acorn toxicity. Less commonly used tests include evaluation of fecal osmolality and electrolyte concentrations (sodium and potassium). If the concentration of sodium plus potassium is much less than the osmolality, the result indicates the presence of osmotically active nonelectrolytes, confirming an osmotic diarrhea.",

Culture of multiple fecal samples, typically five, is recommended to increase the sensitivity.608 Culture of a rectal mucosal biopsy or rectal scraping is an alternative to fecal cultures and may increase sensitivity because Salmonella spp. are intracellular organisms. Identifying clostridial species requires anaerobic culture. However, evaluating the presence of toxin in cases of suspected clostridial diarrhea also is critical because Clostridium spp., particularly C. perfringens type A, may be present in normal equine feces.557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 606 Depending on the clostridial species and the laboratory, toxin can be assessed by detecting preformed toxin in the feces, toxin being produced by the isolate in culture, or the toxin gene in the isolate.\n",

Ultrasonography can be used in horses of all ages to evaluate the amount and character of the peritoneal fluid, masses, small intestinal motility, intestinal distention, and wall thickness. In horses with right dorsal colitis the diagnosis has been supported by ultrasonographic evidence of an increase in mural thickness of the right dorsal colon.617 The right dorsal colon may have a prominent hypoechoic layer most likely associated with submucosal edema and inflammatory infiltrates. Although isotope-labeled white blood cell scintigraphic scans also may help identify colonic ulcerations, the availability and sensitivity of the procedure are limited.618 In cases of L. intracellularis, ultrasonography may reveal thickened small intestinal loops and possibly excess free abdominal fluid.335, 563\n",

A small peptide of nine amino acids, AVP is synthesized primarily in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, with smaller quantities produced by various tissues outside the hypothalamus. It is produced as a precursor, prepro-vasopressin, which is packaged into neurosecretory granules and transported axonally via the pituitary stalk (infundibulum) to the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis).

Once stimulated, osmoreceptors send signals to nerve cells in the supraoptic nuclei, which relay the signals down the pituitary stalk to the posterior pituitary stimulating the release of AVP from secretory granules in the nerve endings. Although the exact threshold for AVP release in the horse is unknown, in healthy ponies, an increase of approximately 8 mOsm/kg in plasma osmolality (about 3%) following water deprivation was associated with an increase in plasma AVP concentration from 1.53 \u00b1 0.36 pg/mL to 4.32 \u00b1 1.12 pg/mL.640 When the extracellular fluid becomes hypo-osmolar, less AVP is released, causing less water to be reabsorbed. Although changes in osmolarity are the major stimulus for AVP release, the stimulation of arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors by a reduction in circulating volume and hypotension can also result in AVP release.636, 638 Other stimuli for AVP release that have been reported in some species include stress, pain, nausea, hypoglycemia, and certain drugs such as morphine.",

Within the kidney, one mechanism of action of AVP is to influence aquaporins, which are integral membrane proteins that can form pores in the cell membrane that act primarily as water channels. Binding of AVP to the renal V2 receptor increases aquaporin-2 synthesis and leads to aquaporin-2 water channel insertion into the apical membrane. This aquaporin channel then allows water to move down the osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing water reabsorption by the kidney. AVP also acts to increase urea permeability in the terminal inner medullary collecting duct by regulating urea transporters, increasing the concentration of urea in the medullary interstitium.641 Also, the V2 receptors are active in the loop of Henle, where activation stimulates the reabsorption of sodium.",

This high osmolarity of the renal medullary interstitium surrounding the collecting ducts provides the osmotic gradient necessary for water reabsorption to occur when AVP concentrations are high. The primary mechanism maintaining the hyperosmolar interstitium is countercurrent multiplication, which depends on the structure and function of the loop of Henle636 (Fig. 7.6\n). Essentially, the ongoing active reabsorption of ions from the thick ascending loop of Henle combined with the continued flow of new ions into the loop of Henle ultimately multiplies the medullary solute concentration. Due to the presence of aquaporin channels, the descending loop of Henle is permeable to water, but it is relatively impermeable to solute. Thus as tubular fluid enters the descending loop and moves toward the inner medulla, it gradually becomes more hypertonic as water moves out into the interstitium. In the thin ascending loop of Henle, ions begin to move into the interstitium by passive diffusion. Once fluid enters the thick ascending loop of Henle, sodium, potassium, and chloride are actively reabsorbed via the apical Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter. This active transport of ions, combined with the impermeability of this section to water, results in an increased osmolarity in the renal medullary interstitium. This creates an osmotic pressure gradient, drawing water from the descending limb and increasing the osmolarity of the tubular fluid. This process is repeated as fluid continues to flow through the tubules, with the net effect of continuing to add sodium to the medullary interstitium until the osmolarity reaches 1200 to 1400 mOsm/L. The collecting ducts also contribute to the hyperosmolar interstitium through the active transport of ions and the facilitated diffusion of urea into the interstitium. The relatively low blood flow in the renal medulla and the unique characteristics of the vasa recta help to maintain the hyperosmolar interstitium.",

A major stimulus for thirst is increased osmolarity of the extracellular fluid, which causes intracellular dehydration in the thirst centers, stimulating the sensation of thirst. In human beings the threshold for stimulation of thirst is approximately 2 to 5 mOsm/kg greater than that for stimulation of AVP release. Also, decreases in extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure can stimulate thirst via mechanisms that are distinct from osmolarity. These mechanisms include neural input from cardiopulmonary and systemic baroreceptors and the release of angiotensin II, which can both stimulate thirst and decrease renal fluid excretion. Peripherally, mechanoreceptors in the oropharynx can sense dryness of the mouth, stimulating thirst.

Also, in human patients, gestational diabetes insipidus can occur due to degradation of AVP by a placental enzyme. Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when there is inadequate production or secretion of AVP. This form of diabetes, or inflammatory disease involves the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus there is insensitivity of the renal collecting duct epithelial cells to AVP, and the condition may be primary or acquired. Primary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus implies isolated dysfunction of the response to AVP not associated with actual structural or metabolic problems of the kidney. In people this occurs as a familial disorder with an X-linked autosomal semirecessive mode of inheritance, and there is some evidence this may occur as a familial problem in horses as well. Acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be associated with renal disease or altered sensitivity of nephrons to AVP due to endotoxemia or cortisol excess. Also, in some species, hypercalcemia, potassium depletion, and the administration of certain drugs such as gentamicin have been reported to cause insensitivity of the collecting duct receptors to AVP.",

The pathogenesis of polyuria and polydipsia in PPID is not completely understood and most likely involves multiple factors. As some horses with PPID are hyperglycemic, osmotic diuresis associated with glucosuria may play a role. Although it has not been documented, the enlarged pars intermedia may impinge on the posterior pituitary and/or hypothalamus, potentially causing secondary neurogenic diabetes insipidus by interfering either with the production or release of AVP or possibly with osmoreceptors involved in thirst. Also, an increase in plasma cortisol associated with PPID may result in antagonism of the action of AVP at the renal tubule.",

In general, the degree of polydipsia and polyuria tends to be more pronounced with psychogenic polydipsia and diabetes insipidus than with renal failure or PPID. Several means of urine collection have been devised. Generally close observation and cross-tying are required to ensure the device stays in place and measurements are accurate. In general water intake over 100 mL/kg per day and urine output over 50 mL/kg per day are consistent with polydipsia and polyuria in adult horses. Factors that can influence water intake and urine production, such as diet and environmental conditions, should be taken into consideration.

Urine specific gravity (USG) is decreased in horses with polyuria and polydipsia. The extent of the decrease in USG, along with the presence or absence of other abnormalities on laboratory tests, can help prioritize differential diagnoses and may direct additional testing. Horses with psychogenic polydipsia tend to present with hyposthenuria (USG less than 1.008 and osmolality less than 260 mOsm/kg) without other laboratory abnormalities. As hyposthenuria indicates that renal diluting ability is intact, horses with renal failure or complete medullary washout are unlikely to have hyposthenuria, although it may occasionally be present in horses recovering from acute renal failure. Chronic renal failure is suggested by the presence of isothenuria (USG 1.008\u20131.014 and osmolality 260\u2013300 mOsm/kg) with concurrent azotemia.681, 682, 683 Other laboratory abnormalities that may be seen with chronic renal failure include mild anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, hypochloridemia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Some additional laboratory tests that may be used to assess renal function include fractional excretion of electrolytes, urinary protein\u2013to\u2013urinary creatinine ratio, creatinine clearance, and measurement of urinary enzymes. Measurement of glomerular filtration rate is a sensitive indicator of renal dysfunction but is infrequently performed primarily for practical reasons. Measurement of symmetric dimethylarginine, a methylated form of arginine that is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, is useful in the evaluation of renal function in small animals and is under investigation in horses.684\n",

Water deprivation testing is contraindicated in horses that are dehydrated or azotemic. In normal animals, the increase in plasma osmolality that occurs with water deprivation results in the release of AVP, which acts on the renal tubules and collecting ducts to conserve water, increasing USG. Before initiating the test, baseline values for USG, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, and body weight should be obtained and the bladder emptied by catheterization. After water is removed, USG and body weight should be monitored every 6 to 12 hours. Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine may be monitored as well. In response to 24 to 72 hours of water deprivation, normal horses will increase their USG over 1.045 with an osmolality over 1500 mOsm/kg. For practical purposes, if USG increases above 1.025 within 24 hours or by the time that 5% of body weight is lost, concentrating ability is adequate and the test can be discontinued. The test should be terminated if there is a loss of more than 5% of the body weight or if clinical signs of dehydration or azotemia develop. Typically, horses with psychogenic polydipsia can concentrate their urine in response to water deprivation whereas those with diabetes insipidus cannot. Occasionally horses with psychogenic polydipsia will have incomplete concentrating ability due to medullary washout and loss of the medullary interstitial osmotic gradient. These horses may respond to a modified water deprivation test where water intake is gradually restricted for several days allowing for restoration of the medullary interstitial osmotic gradient.687 Horses with either central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus cannot effectively concentrate their urine in response to water deprivation, and to distinguish these conditions additional testing such as measurement of endogenous AVP concentrations and evaluation of the response to exogenous AVP is indicated.",

For example, inflammatory airway disease (IAD) has been shown to alter pulmonary mechanics through changes in lung compliance, greater viscous lung resistance, and rate of dynamic work of breathing.703 Due to the increase in ventilatory load, the energy required for breathing is significantly higher in affected horses, which may limit their performance. Also, a higher neutrophil percentage in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of horses with poor racing performance has been correlated with significantly lower relative gas flows during inspiration and expiration.704\nAlthough the effects of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) on performance are not entirely clear, in a study of 132 horses with a history of poor performance, exercise-induced hypoxemia was seen in horses with IAD and EIPH.705 Gas exchange was most significantly impaired in those horses with concurrent EIPH and upper airway obstruction.

Among the most common respiratory problems associated with poor performance in the equine athlete is dynamic airway obstruction, affecting both racing and nonracing performance horses.699, 700, 702, 709, 300, 719 In the study of 275 racehorses evaluated for poor performance, 110 (40%) were found to have dynamic airway obstruction.699 Similarly, in the study of 348 racehorses and show horses with poor performance, 148 (42.6%) had dynamic airway obstruction.700 Of these 148 affected horses, 39 were found to have multiple airway abnormalities, and an additional 22 were found to have a concurrent cardiac arrhythmia. The most common conditions causing airway obstruction include dorsal displacement of the soft palate and idiopathic left laryngeal hemiplegia with arytenoid collapse, also referred to as recurrent laryngeal neuropathy. Other conditions diagnosed have included axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds, dynamic pharyngeal collapse, epiglottic entrapment, subepiglottic cyst, fourth branchial arch defect (rostral displacement of the palatopharyngeal arch, laryngeal dysplasia), and redundant alar folds. Horses of Quarter Horse breeding with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) may suffer dynamic collapse of the airway when exercising.720\n",

The effects of EIPH on performance have been difficult to measure because there are so many confounding factors, but current evidence suggests that moderate to severe EIPH adversely affects athletic capacity.227, 722 Clinical bacterial or viral respiratory tract infection significantly affects performance, but the role of subclinical infections is less clear.

The clinician should establish the use of the horse, the time in training, and the specifics of the training program. Determining whether the horse has never performed as expected or has experienced a decline in the level of performance is crucial. If the horse has never performed as expected, the veterinarian should consider a lack of ability, congenital abnormalities, and training problems. A change in performance, either sudden or insidious, often is associated with an acquired problem. The clinician should characterize specifically the decline in performance, including the intensity of exercise at which signs are observed and whether performance is abnormal from the onset of exercise or declines during an exercise bout. In those cases in which performance drops off during exercise, the clinician should determine whether the decline is acute or gradual and whether any other signs, such as stridor, are associated with it.",

Horses that are not fit or that have respiratory disease have lower values. Another useful reference is the blood or plasma lactate at conclusion of the 10-m/sec exercise step of the incremental test, and highly fit, athletic horses usually have values below 5 mmol/L.

The Thoroughbred horse has VO2max values that are higher than those of many other mammalian species when expressed on a mass-specific basis. The major factor responsible for the high VO2max in athletic horses is their high oxygen-carrying capacity, which arises from a high maximum stroke volume and to some extent a large arteriovenous oxygen content difference.
