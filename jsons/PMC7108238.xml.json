The discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a Gram-negative bacterium from gastric mucosa that is responsible for gastric and duodenal ulcers [3], has further promoted both research and medical applications of bismuth. Currently, three bismuth drugs, that is, bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol\u00ae), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol\u00ae), and ranitidine bismuth citrate (Tritec\u00ae and Pylorid\u00ae) are being used worldwide in combination with antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori infection. In addition, many new bismuth compounds with different structures and activities as well as bismuth nanotubes have been synthesized [2\u2022, 4, 5].",

Recent advances in biophysics and molecular biology have provided invaluable tools necessary to study the bioinorganic chemistry of bismuth. For example, time-resolved inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry enables bismuth antiulcer drugs to be tracked in single Helicobacter pylori cells (ca. 1.0 \u00d7 106 Bi atoms/cell). The uptake of bismuth by Helicobacter pylori is retarded by ferric ions (Fe3+) suggesting that bismuth drugs may utilize certain iron-transport pathways in the pathogen [9]. A number of protein targets of bismuth drugs, in particular those from the H. pylori have been identified by metallomic and metalloproteomic approach [10\u2022, 11]. Several comprehensive reviews summarized the chemistry and biological chemistry of bismuth as well as its medical applications are available recently [1, 2\u2022, 6, 11, 12]. Here we will only focus on some recent advances in the structures and protein targets of bismuth drugs as well as design of potentially active new bismuth complexes.",

Various bismuth citrate complexes with different bismuth to citrate ratios have been crystallized at different pH values. Among these, the structure obtained under acidic condition (pH 3) most probably represents real situation in the stomach [13]. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) is likely to assemble into sheets and then three-dimensional polymers using bismuth citrate dinuclear units [Bi(cit)2Bi]2\u2212 as building blocks to form a protective coating on the ulcer craters [13].",

The protonated ethylenediamine, despite unobservable in the structure (Figure 1b), and pyridine moieties (Figure 1c) are embedded probably by diffusion or electrostatic interaction in the polymeric framework to achieve charge balance since all citrate anions found in the structures are deprotonated leading to citrate tetrannions ([C6H4O7]4\u2212). The composition of the bismuth citrate complex frameworks depends on the size and level of protonation of the inserted cations, the pH values as well as the time of crystallization. The structural model of ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) was constructed based on the framework of crystal structure of complex 1 [14]. Ranitidine molecules can be readily embedded into the cavities perpendicular to the bc plane with H-bonds formed between ranitidine and the bound citrate ligands, Figure 1d. In addition, the sulfur atoms of ranitidine form H-bonds with a water molecule that coordinates to bismuth. Based on X-ray crystal structures as well as ESI-MS of bismuth citrate complexes, it is likely that bismuth citrate-based drugs degrade under gastric acidic condition (pH \u223c 3), from 3-D polymer framework to 2-D polymeric sheets and finally to a basic dimeric unit such as [Bi(cit)2Bi]2\u2212 that can be absorbed or transported by membrane receptors.",

Structural characterization of bismuth carboxylates is challenging owing to difficulties in controlling hydrolysis of these complexes or the formation of coordination oligomers/polymers. Recently, structures [Bi38O44(Hsal)26(Me2CO)16(H2O2)]\u00b7(Me2CO4) and [Bi9O7(Hsal)13(Me2CO)5]\u00b7(Me2CO)1.5 (Figure 1e) may provide an insight into the nature of BSS and a basis for studies the mode of action of the drug [8]. The crystals of [Bi9O7(Hsal)13(Me2CO)5]\u00b7(Me2CO)1.5 initially predominate with only relative small amounts of the large cluster with 38 bismuth atoms that appeared to be the least soluble and most thermodynamically stable form when extending crystal growth times. The structure contains a basic building block [Bi6O8]2+ polyhedron as found in other bismuth oxo clusters [15], which have six octahedral Bi atoms with the eight O atoms located over all of the triangular faces. The cores of the two structures are the Bi9 clusters comprised of a central Bi6 octahedron but with only seven of the eight trigonal faces capped by an O atom as shown in Figure 1f. In both structures, bismuth also coordinated to the solvent molecules of acetone, which can be replaced by other solvent molecules such as DMF (dimethyflormamide) when crystallized in this solvent [7\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, the core of [Bi9O7(Hsal)13(Me2CO)5]\u00b7(Me2CO)1.5 lies at the heart of [Bi38O44(Hsal)26(Me2CO)16(H2O2)]\u00b7(Me2CO4) combined with the presence of Bi-coordinated solvent molecules in these structures reveals a possible process for hydrolysis and core formation, and indicates that the complex [Bi9O7(Hsal)13(Me2CO)5]\u00b7(Me2CO)1.5 gave rise to the complex [Bi38O44(Hsal)26(Me2CO)16(H2O2)]\u00b7(Me2CO4).",

However, these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also cause gastrointestinal damage. Bismuth derivatives of NSAIDs exhibited good in vitro activity against the three strains of H. pylori with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) \u2265 6.25 \u03bcg/mL, which are better than commercially used BSS (8 \u03bcg/mL), laboratory prepared bismuth salicylate (\u226512.5 \u03bcg/mL) and CBS (\u226512.5 \u03bcg/mL) [18]. Therefore, these compounds may have great potential in the treatment of H. pylori infection while allowing the concomitant therapeutic benefits of NSAID treatment. Similarly, heteroleptic bismuth sulfosalicylate complexes [PhBi(HSsal)H2O]\u221d and [PhBi(HSsal)H2O]\u221d as well as bis-phenylbismuth sulfonates [Ph2Bi(O3SR)]\u221d (R = \np-toly, mesityl or S-(+)-10-camphoryl) [17, 25] showed significant activities against H. pylori with MIC < 6.25 \u03bcg/mL. Some cyclic organobismuth compounds bearing a nitrogen or sulfur atoms as additional ring member also exhibit various antibacterial activities including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [26]. Although these bismuth-containing complexes showed in vitro activities against H. pylori and other pathogens, there appears to be lack of in vivo data and more works are warranted to promote medical application of these complexes.",

Some organobismuth compounds have been also found to exhibit anti-tumor potentials [2\u2022, 24]. Bismuth xanthate complexes [Bi(S2COR)3] (R = Et, i-Pr, cyclohexyl) were shown to exert cytotoxic activities against Calu-6 (lung adenocarcinoma) with a similar IC50 values of cisplatin [28], indicating that these compounds have potency comparable to cisplatin. Moreover, these bismuth complexes also exerted cytotoxic activities against cisplatin-insensitive MCF-7 (mammary carcinoma) [28]. Bismuth dithiocarbamate complexes with general formula of [Bi(S2CNR2)] were also demonstrated to exhibit potent in vitro cytotoxicity against a panel of seven human cancer cell lines [23]. Some heterocyclic organobismuth compounds have potent cytotoxic activities against various cancer cell lines with IC50 in the range of 0.059\u20135.1 \u03bcM, in particular, are sensitive towards leukemic cell lines [20, 29]. These bismuth compounds such as bi-chlorodibenzo[c,f][1,5]thiabismocine may induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells through the activation of caspase, production of ROS, and perturbation of mitochondria [20], they may also target tubulin to induce G2/M arrest in HeLa cells probably by interacting with the colchicines-binding site through its thiolate (\u2014SH) groups [29]. This type of organobismuth compounds may be utilized as antimitotic agents and in the treatment of refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia similar to arsenic trioxide.",

A series of bismuth complexes including bismuth nitrilotriacetate Bi(NTA), bismuth tricysteine Bi(Cys)3, RBC, bismuth ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Bi(EDTA)) as well as bismuth complexes with various N,O-containing chelate ligands including bismuth porphyrin complexes were examined against the SARS-CoV helicase [21, 22], which was postulated to be the potential target for anti-SARS therapy [30]. The majority of bismuth complexes tested exhibited activities against SARS-CoV helicase ATPase and duplex-unwinding activities with the highest activities found for RBC and bismuth porphyrin complexes at IC50 values of less than 1 \u03bcM. Bi(EDTA) and other two bismuth complexes with N,O-containing chelate ligands showed almost no activity, indicating that different inhibition activities of these complexes are correlated to their different coordination environments, that is, the higher affinity of bismuth towards the chelate ligands, the lower activities. The treatment of SARS-CoV infected cells by bismuth-containing complexes such as RBC and Bi2-hTF (hTF = human transferrin) confirmed an inhibitory role of bismuth during later stages of the replicative cycle [22]. The studies represent the first attempt in using bismuth as anti-virus agent although further work is required to elucidate such activities.",

            "text": "The mechanism of action of bismuth drugs is complicated and not fully understood. It is generally believed that bismuth drugs are taken up into gastric mucus to form a protective coating probably as BiOCl and bismuth citrate complexes on the ulcer crater. They may inhibit Helicobacter pylori adherence and also bind strongly to connective tissue proteins, mucus glycoproteins and enzymes [1, 2\u2022]. Accumulative studies demonstrated that proteins (peptides) are likely to be the potential targets of the drugs. Bismuth drugs have been shown to interact with a range of proteins such as human serum transferrin [31, 32], lactoferrin [33], serum albumin [32, 34], and metallothionein [35]. The binding of bismuth to lactoferrin may deprive of iron acquisition of H. pylori since the bacteria utilize host-specific lactoferrin for iron acquisition [36]. The level of bismuth uptake by H. pylori single cell is also found to be reversibly correlated to the level of iron [9]. Bismuth drugs have also been demonstrated to inhibit several enzymes from H. pylori. It inhibits the activity of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase by interfering with the zinc site and altering enzyme native structures [37]. Once bismuth is up-taken by the pathogen H. pylori, it may target several proteins inside the pathogen to inhibit synthesis of essential enzymes such as urease and hydrogenase or other nickel-binding proteins, which are critical for bacterial survival. Very recently, the metallomics/metalloproteomics approach has been used to investigate the role of metals in biological systems [38\u2022, 39\u2022] and to search for putative binding proteins (targets) of bismuth drugs inside the bacterium [10\u2022, 40, 41]. The recent advances in this area are updated since other information has been summarized elsewhere [1, 2\u2022, 6, 11].",

It catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield carbamate and ammonia and thus neutralizes its immediate environment of the bacterium to aid its survival under acidic conditions of the gastric lumen and mucosa. Bismuth complexes such as, RBC as well as some triarylbismuthanes can inhibit urease activity [42, 43]. Inhibition of jack bean urease by the triarylbismuthanes compounds is in good agreement with observed antibacterial activity of the compounds against H. pylori [43]. Both Bi(EDTA) and Bi(Cys)3 are competitive inhibitors of jack bean urease, while RBC is a non-competitive inhibitor. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that Bi(EDTA) is both a competitive inhibitor and a time-dependent inactivator of the recombinant Klebsiella areogenes urease. Such an inhibition is probably due to the binding of bismuth to the cysteine residues of the enzyme (Cys319 in Klebsiella areogenes and probably Cys592 in jack bean urease) at the entrance of the active site [42].",

            "text": "The survival of H. pylori requires a constant supply of Ni2+ ions for the synthesis and activities of the Ni2+-containing enzymes. Like other bacteria, H. pylori has to be able to strike a delicate balance between the import of Ni2+ ions, their efficient intracellular storage and delivery to Ni2+-dependent metalloenzymes when required. H. pylori is able to synthesize a small histidine-rich cytoplasmic protein Hpn (28 histidine out of 60 amino acids) and histidine-rich glutamine-rich proteins Hpnl (18 histidine and 30 glutamine out of 71 amino acids), which may play roles of storage of nickel ions as a \u2018reservoir\u2019, donation of nickel to other proteins and detoxification via sequestration of excess nickel ions depending on the exogenous nickel levels [44, 45, 46]. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that Hpn and Hpnl sequester nickel ions at neutral pH but donate them probably for urease activation under acidic condition [44, 45, 47]. H. pylori lacking hpn/hpnl gene, cultured in vitro, are more susceptible to Ni2+ and Bi3+ than the wild-type strain. Both essential metal ions such as Ni2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and therapeutic metal ions, for example, Bi3+ bind to Hpn in vitro, indicating that Hpn may serve as a potential target for bismuth therapy. Hpn binds ca. 4.8 \u00b1 0.2 Ni2+ and 3.8 \u00b1 0.2 Bi3+ per monomer probably via multiple imidazole groups and four Cys residues with dissociate constants (K\nd) of 7.1 and 11.1 \u03bcM respectively [47, 48], while Hpn-like (Hpnl) binds ca. 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 Ni2+ per monomer (K\nd of 3.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM) and two histidine residues (His29 and His31) were identified to play a critical role in binding of Ni2+ [45, 49]. Whether Hpnl interacts with bismuth drugs is not known and may warrant for studies. Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach has allowed studies of metal binding properties of Hpn (where the protein sequence is inserted between the FRET partners CFP and YFP) both in vitro and in vivo. It was found that when Hpn-FRET was expressed in a model system, for example, E. coli, FRET change was only observed with addition of bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) but not Ni2+ and Zn2+, clearly indicating that Hpn is a potential target for bismuth in vivo [50\u2022\u2022]. The binding of bismuth to the protein may therefore interfere with its normal functions.",

Immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) in combination with two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a particularly useful tool for elucidating the metabolism of intracellular metal ions and identifying molecular targets or binding proteins associated with the disease etiology and pathology for metallodrugs [10\u2022, 40]. This approach has been used for the first time to search the potential protein targets of bismuth drugs in H. pylori on a genome-wide scale. A comparative proteomic analysis of H. pylori cells before and after treatment of CBS was performed [41]. Eight proteins were found to be significantly upregulated or downregulated, Figure 2b. These proteins are mainly involved in either cellular processes (HspA, HspB, putative alkyl hydroperoxide reductase TsaA and neutrophil-activating protein NapA), or oxidative stress resistance (thioredoxin), and hemoglobin. The upregulated expression of thioredoxin, a low redox potential reductant, may reflect the response of H. pylori to the high level of oxidative stress. Using immobilized-bismuth affinity chromatography (Bi-IMAC), seven bismuth-binding proteins were subsequently identified from H. pylori cell extracts Figure 2c. Interestingly, the intracellular levels of four proteins, for example, HspA, HspB, NapA, TsaA were decreased upon addition of CBS, Figure 2c, suggesting that these proteins directly bind to bismuth. The other bismuth-binding proteins identified include fumarase and urease subunit UreB and a translational factor Ef-Tu. Furthermore, it was found that bismuth led to around 8-fold decrease in cellular protease activity and elevated the levels of lipid hydroperoxide and hemin in the whole cell extract of bismuth-treated H. pylori cells than those untreated cells [41].",

            "text": "To validate the potential targets of bismuth drugs identified by metalloproteomic approach subsequent studies have been carried out [51, 52\u2022\u2022, 53]. For example, fumarase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to malic acid, binds one Bi3+ per monomer, leading to an apparent non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme [53]. HspA, a member of the GroES chaperonin family, is a small protein with a unique histidine/cysteine-rich domain at the C terminus with the sequence shown in Figure 3a. Apart from the normal function of GroES, for example, aiding protein folding in conjunction with GroEL, it also plays a role in nickel regulation: to facilitate nickel acquisition by donation of nickel to appropriate proteins (and enzymes), and to detoxificate excess nickel [51]. Recombinant HspA from H. pylori was found to bind about two Bi3+ ions (or two Ni2+) per monomer of the protein, Figure 3b, and the C-terminal Cys\u2013Cys motif and histidine residues are probably involved in the binding, similar to Hpn [44, 48, 51, 54]. The potential roles of the His-rich and Cys-rich terminus in vivo was examined by comparison of the growth of E. coli cells expressing the wild type or C-terminal deletion mutant in M9 minimal medium supplemented with metal ions in a concentration-dependent manor [51]. E. coli cells expressing the C-terminal deletion mutant were more susceptible to increasing concentrations of nickel ions. By contrast, Bi3+ retarded the growth of the wild type-containing cells [51]. Surprisingly, apart from the C-terminal metal binding domain, three residues (His45, Cys51, and Cys53) are found to be critical for Zn2+ binding in vivo but not for other transition metal ions such as Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+ [52\u2022\u2022]. These residues are located at the N-terminal apical domain and were probably originated from negative selection (Figure 3d) and make up an oxidation-sensitive zinc binding site since the Zn2+-bound HpGroES\u0394MBD restored the activity of enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP). Equilibrium dialysis study showed that bismuth binds to the C-terminal deleted HpGroES (HpGroES\u0394MBD) in a similar pattern to Zn2+ with an affinity 40-fold higher than that bismuth binding to the C-terminal metal binding domain [52\u2022\u2022]. Competition experiments between Bi3+ and Zn2+ reacting with HpGroES\u0394MBD indicated that bismuth is able to replace the bound zinc from the protein, Figure 3e. Significantly, the binding of bismuth to GroES altered its quaternary structure from its native heptamer to a dimer, which is attributable to bismuth binding to the N-terminal zinc-site, not the C-terminal metal binding domain, Figure 3f. Taken together, once bismuth drugs entered the H. pylori, they may interfere with nickel homeostasis by binding to nickel storage proteins (Hpn/Hpnl), and accessory proteins (HspA) responsible for hydrogenase or urease synthesis. The bismuth drugs are also likely to inhibit protease and urease activity; and modulate cellular oxidative stress.",

Extensive studies have been carried out to explore other potentials of bismuth drugs and amazingly, bismuth also exhibits in vitro activities such as anti-Leishmanial activity, anti-tumor activity that both antimony and arsenic possess. Currently, no bismuth-containing compounds are in clinical trial for treatment of either cancer or viral infection. Nevertheless, some recent in vitro data are quite encouraging [20]. Further extensive explore may be needed in future. Moreover, pretreatment of bismuth drugs can reduce the side-effects of anticancer drugs such as cisplatin [55], which may also offer a potential for the application of bismuth in the treatment of cancer.",
