Most years, influenza outbreaks are relatively predictable, causing 30,000\u201340,000 deaths in the United States. More serious threats come in the form of exceptionally transmissible or virulent influenza virus variants, which can give rise to worldwide pandemics and greatly increased morbidity and mortality. New viral variants arise through a combination of antigenic drift\u2014gradual changes brought about by point mutations in viral genes\u2014and antigenic shift\u2014abrupt changes brought about by the reassortment of complete viral gene segments. But while the mechanisms underlying the evolution of new influenza virus variants are relatively well understood, comparably less is known about the virus\u2013host interactions that determine disease outcome.",

In the case of influenza virus, which encodes less than a dozen genes, hundreds of papers have been published on the viral NS1 protein, which has been reported to have numerous functions that can potentially impact virulence [1]. The viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes have also been implicated as virulence determinants, as have components of the viral polymerase. Although knowledge of viral protein function has been instrumental in the development of anti-influenza drugs, which include inhibitors of NA (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and the viral M2 ion channel (amantadine and rimantadine), drug-resistant influenza viruses continue to emerge and there remains a need for new and effective antiviral therapies [2]. Similarly, challenges remain in developing influenza vaccines that are protective across a broad range of strains, as the most effective vaccines promote an immune response against HA, which is the most variable of the viral proteins [3].",

At the genomic level, the lungs of these animals exhibited an early (day 1) increase in the expression of cytokine, chemokine, and apoptosis-related genes, including genes associated with death receptor, IL-6, type I IFN, and Toll-like receptor responses. This response was unique to the r1918-infected animals and was not observed in the lungs of mice infected with a contemporary (and less pathogenic) H1N1 strain. Increased inflammatory gene expression paralleled destruction of the respiratory epithelium and was sustained until the death of the animals, providing a first glimpse of an inflammatory signature that has since become pathognomonic with severe respiratory virus infection (Fig. 2\n).",

The first experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with r1918 resulted in acute respiratory distress and death, with all animals euthanized by day 8 due to the severity of symptoms [17]. Genomic analysis of bronchial tissue from r1918-infected animals (chosen because of less immune cell infiltration than in the lung) also revealed an early and sustained induction of inflammatory cytokine (particularly IL-6) and chemokine genes, including CXCL1 and CXCL6, which are important for the recruitment of neutrophils. In contrast, macaques infected with a less pathogenic H1N1 strain showed increased expression of DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), type 1 IFN, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) early after infection, but this response was down-regulated at later time points as the animals recovered. Fewer ISGs were induced in r1918-infected macaques, but those that were induced retained high levels of expression until the death of the animals. Interestingly, a similar lack of attenuation of early immune activation leading to death is observed in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, indicating that uncontrolled immune responses might be a general mechanism of pathogenicity across a wide range of viruses and hosts [18].",

In a direct comparison of the host response to r1918 and H5N1 infection, both viruses were found to cause early and severe lung pathology and both induced similar ISG expression at 12-h post infection. However, by 24-h post infection, while both viruses reached similar titers, only the r1918 virus induced the expression of numerous genes related to cell death and inflammation, including the inflammasome components NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2 [20].

The H5N1 virus also disseminated to the brain and spleen, and a computational approach identified a correlation between tissue dissemination and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory responses and the down-regulation of anti-inflammatory genes.

In vitro systems have further been used to examine the extent to which the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, a major regulator of inflammatory gene expression, has on the host response to H5N1 infection [30]. Infecting primary human endothelial cells in the presence or absence of a dominant negative mutant of I\u03baB kinase 2, which blocks the activation of NF-\u03baB, revealed that the majority of H5N1-induced genes were NF-\u03baB-dependent.

Coupled with targeted siRNA knockdown, these analyses confirmed the role of IRF3 in H5N1 induction of IFN response genes and also identified a requirement for the transcription factors HMGA1 and NFATC4 in mediating the strong inflammatory response induced by H5N1 infection. The combination of NF-\u03baB, HMGA1, and NFATC4 signaling may therefore be of particular importance in the inflammatory response induced in endothelial cells by highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.",

The two most prominent networks identified included genes associated with the immune response or keratinization processes. The mechanisms by which changes in keratin gene expression contribute to the host response to H5N1 virus infection are not clear, but alterations in keratin may impact such processes as intracellular viral transport and budding.

Yet as reviewed elsewhere [33], despite efforts to target the host response with a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs, this approach has been largely unsuccessful. At least part of the difficulty may rest with the timing at which anti-inflammatory or immunomodulating drugs are administered. Just as genomic profiling studies have revealed that the timing and duration of the inflammatory response is an important factor in disease outcome, so too is it likely that the timing at which elements of the host response are suppressed or enhanced through drug therapy needs to be carefully controlled. With the increasing sophistication of computational approaches, one challenge for the future will be to garner a deeper understanding of the rapidly changing dynamics of the immune response (see Section 10). This may lead to rational improvements in both the targets and timing of immunomodulatory therapy.",

In particular, infection of macaques with either of two genetically similar but clinically distinct human isolates resulted in clinical disease that ranged from mild to severe pneumonia, closely mimicking human infection with these viruses [38]. Gene expression profiling of lung tissue from these animals revealed the induction of numerous genes related to the inflammatory response, and in animals infected with the virus causing more severe clinical symptoms, there was also up-regulation of a network of NF-\u03baB signaling molecules, which correlated with increased pro-inflammatory plasma cytokine levels (e.g., IL-6 and MCP-1) early after infection. However, unlike r1918 or H5N1 infection, these responses resolved and the animals recovered from infection. Comparing the host response to highly pathogenic and 2009 H1N1 viruses might therefore lead to the identification of immune activation attenuation signals that could represent potential targets for therapy against r1918 and H5N1 infection.",

This observation was confirmed computationally using nonparametric multidimensional scaling to visualize global gene expression concordance across the transcriptional profiles elicited by these viruses (Fig. 3\n). In addition, animals infected with the mouse-adapted virus exhibited perturbation in the expression of lipid metabolism genes later in infection, as was observed previously in macaques infected with H5N1 virus.

In a study by Ma et al., pigs were infected with a human 2009 H1N1 isolate, a 2009 swine isolate, or with a 1918-like classical swine influenza virus [42]. Both of the 2009 viruses caused mild clinical symptoms, whereas the classical swine virus induced only fever. Animals infected with the 2009 viruses exhibited an increase in the transcription of inflammatory and immune response pathways that included genes associated with pattern recognition receptor signaling. By day 5 after infection, these animals also exhibited increased expression of genes associated with cell death and lipid metabolism. In contrast, these responses were largely absent in animals infected with the classical swine virus, and the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism was actually suppressed. It is possible that the suppression of lipid metabolism genes may be due in part by the actions of the NS1 protein of the 1918-like virus. Previous transcriptional studies have shown that infection of a lung epithelial cell line with a recombinant seasonal virus containing the 1918 NS1 gene results in the down-regulation of a network of genes associated with lipid metabolism [44].",

Animals infected with the seasonal virus plus S. pneumonia also survived infection, whereas bacterial co-infection with the 2009 pandemic virus resulted in 100% mortality. Interestingly, lethal bacterial co-infection was not accompanied by a significant increase in the inflammatory response, but rather was characterized by increased basal epithelial cell apoptosis and a lack of cellular gene transcription associated with re-proliferation and repair (a transcriptional response that was elicited by the seasonal virus).

For example, when used to infect lung epithelial cells, an A/WSN/33 (mouse-adapted) virus containing the 1918 NS1 gene efficiently blocked the expression of IFN-regulated genes, whereas the parental A/WSN/33 virus elicited significant induction of IFN-regulated gene expression [5]. This approach was also taken a step further by swapping the NS1 genes of the 1918 and seasonal A/Texas/36/91 viruses [44]. Again, the recombinant virus containing the 1918 NS1 gene induced cytokine and chemokine gene expression, but blocked the transcription of many IFN-regulated genes and genes associated with lipid metabolism. In contrast, the opposite effect was observed in cells infected with r1918 engineered to contain the A/Texas/36/91 NS1 gene. Similarly, infection of primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells with an A/Texas/36/91 virus containing a deletion of the C-terminal effector domain of NS1 was used to define the contributions of this domain in the suppression of IFN signaling [51]. Together, these studies have demonstrated the importance of the NS1 protein in regulating the host response to infection, particularly with regard to IFN-regulated gene expression, and point to this protein as a key contributor to the high virulence of the 1918 pandemic virus. In the same way, additional studies have focused on recombinant viruses expressing HA and NA from the 1918 virus [6] and H5N1 viruses containing single amino acid substitutions in the viral polymerase (PB2) [52] or PB1-F2 protein [53] that result in increased virulence.",

A common method in this regard is the use of targeted gene knockout mice. While not a new concept, the addition of genomic profiling adds an important dimension by providing the ability to learn how loss of function in one aspect of the host response affects other aspects of viral recognition or innate immune signaling. One of the first studies to profile the transcriptional response of a knockout mouse to influenza virus infection looked at the role of P58IPK, an inhibitor of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases PKR and PERK, which respectively function to regulate protein synthesis during virus infection and the unfolded protein response [54]. Infection of P58IPK-knockout mice with a mouse-adapted virus, or with r1918, resulted in greatly amplified expression of inflammatory and apoptotic response genes, providing the first evidence that P58IPK functions during virus infection to inhibit the over-activation of inflammatory and cell death responses.",

To examine the impact of deficiencies in the key inflammatory mediators TNF and IL1 on virus infection, mice containing gene knockouts in the receptors for these molecules were infected with the r1918 virus [55]. Although the virus was lethal in all animals, TNF receptor knockout mice survived statistically longer than wild-type mice and exhibited delayed or decreased expression of genes associated with antiviral and innate immune signaling and negative acute-phase response. IL1 receptor knockout mice, in contrast, exhibited an increase in the expression of genes associated with dendritic and natural killer cell processes and a compensatory increase in TNF expression. Signaling through the IL1 receptor therefore appears to be protective, whereas signaling through the TNF receptor increases the severity of infection.",

Mx1+/+ mice are partially protected against r1918 infection, and when treated with IFN, fully survive infection and exhibit down-regulated expression of cytokine and chemokine genes normally induced by the r1918 virus [57]. With respect to IFN signaling, infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the \u03b1/\u03b2 IFN receptor results in decreased expression of antiviral genes (e.g., TLR3, PKR, and STAT1) and increased viral replication, but there is no effect on the induction of genes related to inflammatory and apoptotic responses, which are induced to the levels observed in the presence of the receptor [58]. This study, and the above-mentioned interplay between IL1 and TNF, also reveals a significant amount of redundant and compensatory signaling in antiviral and innate immune responses. While informative, such redundancy can also complicate and lead to misleading interpretation of data resulting from the use of gene knockout animals.",

[81] used the results from yeast two-hybrid analysis and gene expression profiling of influenza virus-infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells to computationally predict factors and pathways that affect the viral life cycle. These predictions were then tested by suppressing the expression of these genes through RNAi, resulting in 616 genes whose products affected influenza virus replication. Together, these studies identified cellular factors involved in a variety of functions, including cellular signaling, translation initiation, and nuclear transport.",

This technique uses a lentiviral-based genetic element that can integrate at a single site in one allele of a gene in either a sense or anti-sense orientation. No prior knowledge or annotation of the gene is necessary, and the result can be either knock-down or over-expression of the gene. The approach generates a library of independent clones that can be screened for a desired phenotype. In this case, the isolation of clones resistant to killing by influenza virus yielded 110 human genes. Only four of these genes had been previously linked to influenza virus infection (MDN1, GRK6, AKT1, and STXBP1), demonstrating the potential of the approach to identify novel targets.",

In general, meta-analysis exposed a striking lack of overlap in the genes identified by these screens. Pair-wise comparisons revealed only 128 genes (out of a total of 1449 identified) that affected influenza virus replication in at least two screens, and the number of genes in common between pairs of screens is even smaller, ranging from zero to 32 genes [83]. This low degree of overlap could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in screening systems, cell types, and viruses and was also observed in RNAi screens used to identify host factors for HIV-1 replication, where only three genes were identified by all three screens [85]. Importantly, concordance might also be affected by the statistical prioritization approaches used and might be generally hampered by a large number of host factors falling within a narrow band of positive or negative correlation with pathogenicity, reminiscent of the challenges faced by gene signature definition [86]. Moreover, only a handful of the genes identified have been subjected to functional analyses to confirm their role in influenza virus replication. These studies, while impressive in the number of genes identified, therefore represent only the initial steps in a much longer road toward a deeper understanding of the virus\u2013host interplay necessary for viral replication and the identification of new drug targets.",

After challenge, animals receiving the live vaccine had reduced viral replication and lung pathology and less activation of cytokine, chemokine, and IFN-regulated genes compared with that observed in animals vaccinated with a formalin-killed wild-type virus.

In a more comprehensive approach, Nakaya et al. evaluated innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccination against influenza virus using blood samples obtained over a 3-year period from individuals receiving a trivalent inactivated vaccine or a live attenuated vaccine [92]. Although the clinical effectiveness of these vaccines was similar, only the live attenuated vaccine induced robust expression of genes associated with an IFN response (as did only the live vaccine in the macaque study described above). In contrast, the inactivated vaccine induced higher antibody titers, and only the inactivated vaccine induced the expression of genes associated with a plasma B cell response. Using the computational approach of discriminant analysis via mixed integer programming, this gene expression signature was shown to be predictive of later antibody titer.",

The viruses used in these studies caused clinical outcomes that ranged from 100% survival to 100% lethality, and the goal of the analysis was to identify gene expression signatures with the capacity to segregate and predict mild or highly pathogenic infections. A series of computational techniques generated signatures that were either oppositely expressed (referred to as a \u201cdigital\u201d relationship) or that were expressed on a continuum (referred to as an \u201canalog\u201d relationship) when comparing mild and highly pathogenic infections. The best predictor of a highly pathogenic infection was a 57-gene analog signature that included the induction of genes associated with the inflammatory response and chemokine signaling and decreased expression of genes associated with lung repair. The analog nature of this signature indicates that highly pathogenic viruses (including r1918, avian H5N1 viruses, and SARS coronavirus) induce or suppress the expression of many of the same genes as mildly pathogenic viruses, but to a much greater degree. The magnitude of the host response, rather than the induction or suppression of a unique set of genes, therefore appears to be a critical factor in determining disease outcome.",

This study used three complementary approaches: functional similarity analysis, the identification of patterns of coexpression between systems, and a network inference method to identify conserved regulatory influences. Because these approaches do not rely on matching comparable time points between experiments, they can be used to compare data from systems with different sampling times and dynamics. These combined approaches identified functions and pathways that displayed similar behavior or regulation across all three systems, most notably in IFN and inflammatory responses, indicating that significant portions of the response to influenza virus are conserved across cell culture, mouse, and macaque models. Predicted regulatory influences driving this response included GTF2B (a factor also known as TFIIB and targeted by a number of viruses to disrupt transcriptional initiation) and ATF4 (a transcription factor involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response). Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of computational approaches to reveal relationships between in vitro and in vivo systems and for gaining deeper insight into biological responses to infection through the use of pre-existing data sets. It also serves to bolster the much-debated relevance of cell culture systems for predicting responses in animal models.

All three observations can be reconciled into a single hypothesis of time-dependent encoding of host responses, making the timing of components of the host response of utmost importance for the virus\u2013host interactions themselves and for disease outcome and treatment (Fig. 5\n).",

Few data are currently available that follow molecular events over time, and even less so on the appropriate time scales. Immune activation is a process that happens on a single-cell level within minutes to hours rather than hours to days. It will therefore be necessary to generate omics data with high time resolution during the early and relevant transition phases of immune activation. Acquisition of such data faces technical challenges and is limited by problems of synchronization of events, cells, and tissues. However, novel computational approaches should be able to overcome these difficulties. Geometric approaches, for instance low-dimensional, non-linear representations of gene networks based on their activity [98], can be used to renormalize poorly time-resolved data to absolute references (pre-infection versus post-infection; low-pathogenicity versus high-pathogenicity; ressortant versus wild-type viruses) and therefore reinterpret activity differences as differences in observation time. Even more interesting in this context are continuous-time Markov processes defined on a path space spanned by low-resolution experiments. Here, the few available experimental data points over time are expanded through inference methodology allowing approximation and subsequent comparisons of the system's internal time dynamics across different viruses or genetic variants. In order to be successful, these methods will require, in addition to the available data sets, the generation of data from controlled experiments in cell culture systems where key components of immune activation networks are studied individually.",

Today, robustness (a measure of the system's tolerance against external and internal variability) is only studied superficially with respect to detail and quantity. Typically, survival or other global properties of the system are quantified over large time intervals as fractions of affected individuals in a given experiment with at best hundreds of individuals. In order to better understand the molecular network structure and dynamics leading to immune responses, redundancy in these networks, and the relative importance of highly connected (\u201chubs\u201d) as well as sparse regions of the networks (\u201cbottlenecks\u201d), is required to quantify robustness at the level of individual network components. To this end, Collaborative Cross mice and human population genetic studies will provide sources of genetic variability of the host. These will have to be combined with systematic studies of reassortant viruses to explore in detail the interactions between virus and host genetics. It will also be important to focus on subtle variations rather than extreme cases in order to better appreciate the contribution of individual network components.",

In addition, computational research will have to focus on developing better approaches for the inference of network dynamics from network topology similar to what has recently been achieved for metabolic networks [100], as it is not possible to measure all relevant network sub-dynamics in sufficient detail for lack of accessible experimental systems. Finally, we will need to better establish causality in the virus\u2013host networks. Current computational methodology largely focuses on statistical correlations between observables. In order to understand cause and effect relationships in the networks, the above mentioned time-series analyses will need to be accompanied by network inference methodology based on first principle physics [101], [102].",

Such modeling will be required to develop better screening of effective drugs once high-priority targets have been established through the above approaches. To this end, the multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm shows great promise. MAS aims to model complex systems by the use of autonomous programs, named agents, which have independent behaviors and which interact among each other or with a virtual environment [103], [104]. MAS has been applied in social science, economics, and ecology to solve problems such as collective decision making, process optimization, or the analysis of emerging properties. In the context of system biology, MAS represents a system that can simulate the biological mechanisms involved between the major actors of the host immune response across different scales. On a macroscopic level, cell-to-cell and virus-cell interactions and communications can be modeled and integrated with a microscopic level that captures the dynamics of signaling and the triggering of metabolic pathways. Such modeling will help to refine the most important components involved during infection and contribute to a better understanding of emerging properties. Different MAS platforms [105], [106], [107] have already been used to model host immune responses and physical interactions at a single-cell level [108], [109], [110], [111]. Once a better understanding of network sub-structures and dynamics is achieved, better parameter sets will be available to increase the effectiveness of such models in the systematic in silico exploration of virus\u2013host networks in view of possible drug targets and theoretical targeting strategies.",

For example, next-generation sequencing technologies have recently revealed that influenza virus infection induces the differential expression of a variety of long (greater than 200 nucleotide) noncoding RNAs [115]. Many of these RNAs are similarly regulated by IFN treatment, suggesting that long noncoding RNAs may be involved in regulating the host response, including innate immunity. Similarly, there is increasing evidence that microRNAs play a role in the host response to numerous viruses [116], including influenza virus [117]. Next-generation sequencing has also revealed that additional forms of small noncoding RNAs, such as small nuclear RNAs (snoRNAs) and piwi-associated small RNAs (piRNA), are also differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection [118]. Moreover, noncoding RNAs have been found to directly regulate protein function, as exemplified by the identification of the 7SK snRNA as a regulator of HMGA1 function [119]. Next-generation sequencing is therefore adding a critical new analytical component that may alter the way we think about virus\u2013host interactions and gene regulatory mechanisms. It is likely that a detailed knowledge of noncoding RNA regulation and function will be necessary for a full understanding of influenza virus pathogenesis.",
