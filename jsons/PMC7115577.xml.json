Indeed the history of BK isolation and characterization has long been closely related to the use of potentiating factors. Werle and coworkers [74] used snake venoms to trigger the formation of BK from plasma and to describe this tissue hormone functionally. Immediately after the isolation, chemical characterization, synthesis and functional characterization, certain snake venoms were described as bradykinin potentiating compounds. Kato and Suzuki [39], [40], Ferreira et al. [26], [27], and Ondetti et al. [13], [59] isolated different oligopeptides with bradykinin potentiating activity from the venoms of the two snakes Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii and Bothrops jararaca, including the bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide BPP9\u03b1 (trade name TEPROTIDE).",

Very recently new potentiating peptides have been isolated from the venom of B. jararaca\n[36]. Surprisingly peptides with potentiating activity have also been formed by the partial hydrolysis of proteins taken from serum [80], hemoglobin [38], [66], [81], milk [34], [46], or wheat germ [51]. Also degradation fragments of angiotensin such as the heptapeptide 1\u20137 were found to potentiate the BK action [64]. In addition linear BK analogues, partial sequences [7], certain active and inactive side chain and backbone cyclic agonists are able to potentiate the BK action on GPI [68].",

The inhibition of ACE by various peptide and nonpeptide compounds did not correlate well with the potentiating activity [5], [10]. Furthermore, the maximum of the BK-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum can be enhanced by potentiating compounds [77]. Also the action evoked by enzymatically stable BK agonists can be potentiated in some test systems [78]. Repeated exposure of porcine coronary arteries to BK has led to receptor desensitization. The addition of the potentiating compounds quinaprilat or angiotensin 1\u20137 fully restored the relaxant effect at a point when BK alone was no longer able to induce relaxation [76]. At the molecular level the co-immunoprecipitation of ACE and the B2 receptor with an anti receptor antibody clearly indicates an interaction of both partners on the cell membrane [50]. Despite all these contradictory and to some degree confusing findings Regoli and coworkers [29] and Dendorfer et al. [17] have demonstrated that in their test systems (rabbit isolated aorta and venoconstriction) the potentiation by therapeutically used ACE inhibitors results exclusively from the inhibition of enzymatic BK degradation. Nevertheless, the group of Regoli found under influence of ACE inhibitors, a resensitization of the rabbit jugular vein [31] and a change in the density of B2 receptors in rat spinal cord [60].",

We were interested in determining the role of Ca2+-uptake from extracellular sources and its release from sarcoplasmatic reticulum for the potentiating action. We tested the direct interaction with the B2 receptor in COS-7 cells and checked the influence of potentiating peptides on receptor dephosphorylation and selected signal transduction reactions.",

In our test the contraction of GPI can be potentiated by BPP9\u03b1 and by the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat as well. Both potentiators enhance the isotonic measured contraction after 5 min preincubation (Fig. 1\n). The pD2-values for BK were shifted in the presence of 20 nM BPP9\u03b1 from 7.15 \u00b1 0.11 (n\n = 8) to 7.84 \u00b1 0.19 (n\n = 4) and by ramiprilat (20 nM) to 7.87 \u00b1 0.22 (n\n = 4). Both potentiators are also able to shift the cumulative GPI contraction curves for the enzymatically more stable bradykinin analogue DArg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-Pro-\u025bAbu(\u00dfPh)-Arg [16] to higher affinities. The pD2-value of this BK analogue was shifted by BPP9\u03b1 (20 nM) from 6.65 \u00b1 0.14 (n\n = 6) to 7.15 \u00b1 0.18 (n\n = 3) and by ramiprilat to 7.16 \u00b1 0.15 (n\n = 3).",

Our synthesized analogues and fragments of the highly active nonapeptide BPP9\u03b1 show in some cases differences between potentiation and enzyme inhibition of more than five orders of magnitude. This result indicates strongly different structural requirements for both biological activities, and is inconsistent with the exclusive reduction of potentiating action to the inhibition of ACE, as discussed by Regoli and his coworkers [31] and Dendorfer et al.

The inhibitory activity seems to depend on the whole sequence. The replacement of the basic amino acid Arg at position 4 by neutral aliphatic or aromatic amino acids influences the ACE inhibition only slightly, on the other hand the acylation of the Lys side chain at the same position by ASA reduces the IC50 value by four orders of magnitude.

In a variety of publications the enhancement of the intracellular Ca2+-level is used as a qualitative or quantitative proof of the potentiating action. Our results with the inhibition of Ca2+-uptake from extracellular sources by La3+ indicates that the potentiation of BK-action requires mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. On the other hand, in the beginning phase of the BK-evoked GPI contraction extracellular calcium is needed. Thus, our results with La3+ agree well with the finding of Marcic et al. [49], who described the inhibition of resensitization of the BK receptor in CHO cells by La3+.",

These cells constitutively express B1 as well as B2 receptors and have a cell specific set of proteases involved in BK degradation. In this system the potentiating nonapeptide BPP9\u03b1 and ramiprilat accelerate the BK-induced migration. In contrast to Ignjatovic et al. [37], who found on other cells a concentration-dependent direct activation of the B1 receptor in the absence of kinins, we could not detect any activity of the potentiating nonapeptide without administration of B1 or B2 agonists. Though the migratory activity of the proteolytic stabilized BK analogue J725 [16] is potentiated, the action of the nonpeptide agonist FR190997 [4] could not be accelerated by BPP9\u03b1 and ramiprilat. It is difficult to explain this finding. In agreement with the weaker acceleration of the stabilized BK analogue, the effect of the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon and the concentration-dependent potentiation induced by BPP9\u03b1, we might suppose that in this test system the potentiation occurs possibly exclusively by inhibition of the enzymatic BK degradation. But, we also have to consider a different mechanism for the peptide and nonpeptide agonist. This assumption is supported in that test by the strongly reduced intrinsic activity of the nonpeptide agonist FR190997 compared to BK itself.",

The observed differences even exceed the different structural requirements for N- and C-terminal catalytic centers of ACE. The experiments with La3+ gave evidence that the potentiation of smooth muscle contraction requires extracellular Ca2+ which is taken up through opened channels. The increase of the intracellular level of inositol phosphates, triggered by potentiating peptides, leads to an additional enhancement of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Application of potentiating peptides to COS-7 cells which were transiently transfected with the B2 receptor and did not contain endogenous ACE, shows no increase in receptor affinity or density.
