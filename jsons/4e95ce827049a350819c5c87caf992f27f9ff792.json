Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.",

However, the RT-PCR assay tends to be inadequate in many areas that have been severely hit especially during early outbreaks of this disease. The lab test also suffers from high false-negative rates, due to many factors, such as sample preparation and quality control [5] . In clinical practice, easily accessible imaging equipments, such as chest X-ray and thoracic CT, provide huge assistance to clinicians [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Particularly in China, many cases were identified as suspected of COVID-19, if characteristic manifestations in CT scans were observed [5] . The suspected patients, even without clinical symptoms (e.g., fever and coughing), were also hospitalized or quarantined for further lab tests. Given the high false-positive rate of the nucleic acid tests, many suspected patients have to be tested multiple times several days apart before reaching a confident diagnosis. Hence, the imaging findings play a critical role in constraining the viral transmission and also fighting against COVID- 19 .",

In the pre-scan preparation stage, each subject is instructed and assisted by a technician to pose on the Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Imaging Data Acquisition, Segmentation and Diagnosis for COVID-19 patient bed according to a given protocol. In the image acquisition stage, CT images are acquired during a single breath-hold. The scan ranges from the apex to the lung base. Scans are done from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle with the optimized parameters set by the radiologist(s), based on the patient's body shape. From the acquired raw data, CT images are reconstructed and then transmitted through picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) for subsequent reading and diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging technology in the field of medical imaging, has contributed actively to fight COVID-19 [12] . Compared to the traditional imaging workflow that heavily relies on the human labors, AI enables more safe, accurate and efficient imaging solutions. Recent AI-empowered applications in COVID-19 mainly include the dedicated imaging platform, the lung and infection region segmentation, the clinical assessment and diagnosis, as well as the pioneering basic and clinical research. Moreover, many commercial products have been developed, which successfully integrate AI to combat COVID-19 and clearly demonstrate the capability of the technology. The Medical Imaging Computing Seminar (MICS) 1 , a China's leading alliance of medical imaging scholars and start-up companies, organized this first online seminar on COVID-19 on Febuary 18, 2020, which attracted more than ten thousands of visits. All the above examples show the tremendous enthusiasm cast by the public for AI-empowered progress in the medical imaging field, especially during the ongoing pandemic.",

However, the conventional imaging workflow includes inevitable contact between technicians and patients. Especially, in patient positioning, technicians first assist in posing the patient according to a given protocol, such as head-first versus feet-first, and supine versus prone in CT, followed by visually identifying the target body part location on the patient and manually adjusting the relative position and pose between the patient and the X-ray tube.

Scan range can be identified by detecting anatomical joints of the subject from the images. Much recent work [27] [28] [29] has focused on estimating the 2D [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] or 3D keypoint locations [28, [36] [37] [38] [39] on the patient body. These keypoint locations usually include major joints such as the neck, shoulders, elbows, ankles, wrists, and knees. Wang et al. [40] has shown that such an automated workflow can significantly improve scanning efficiency and reduce unnecessary radiation exposure. However, such keypoints usually represent only a very sparse sampling of the full 3D mesh [41] in the 3D space (that defines the digital human body).",

ISO-centering refers to aligning the target body region of the subject, so that the center of the target body region overlaps with the scanner ISO center and thus the overall imaging quality is optimal. Studies have shown that, with better ISO-centering, radiation dosage can be reduced while maintaining similar imaging quality [42] . In order to align the target body region to the ISO center, and given that anatomical keypoints usually represent only a very sparse sampling of the full 3D mesh in the 3D space (defining the digital human body), Georgakis et al. [43] propose to recover human mesh from a single monocular RGB image using a parametric human model SMPL [44] . Unlike other related studies [45] , they employ a hierarchical kinematic reasoning for each kinematic chain of the patient to iteratively refine the estimation of each anatomical keypoint to improve the system robustness to clutters and partial occlusions around the joints of the patient. Singh et al. [18] present a technique, using depth sensor data, to retrieve a full 3D patient mesh by fitting the depth data to a parametric human mesh model based on anatomical landmarks detected from RGB image. One recent solution proposed by Ren et al. [41] learns a model that can be trained just once and have the capability to be applied across multiple such applications based on dynamic multi-modal inference.",

For example, Jin et al. [57] propose a two-stage pipeline for screening COVID-19 in CT images, in which the whole lung region is first detected by an efficient segmentation network based on UNet++. The lung-lesion-oriented methods aim to separate lesions (or metal and motion artifacts) in the lung from lung regions [51-58, 60, 61] . Because the lesions or nodules could be small with a variety of shapes and textures, locating the regions of the lesions or nodules is required and has often been considered a challenging detection task. Notably, in addition to segmentation, the attention mechanism is reported as an efficient localization method in screening [59] , which can be adopted in COVID-19 applications.",

[64] propose the V-Net which utilizes the residual blocks as the basic convolutional block, and optimize the network by a Dice loss. By equipping the convolutional blocks with the so-called bottleneck blocks, Shan et al. [58] use a VB-Net for more efficient segmentation. Zhou et al. [65] propose the UNet++, which is much more complex than U-Net, as the network inserts a nested convolutional structure between the encoding and decoding path. Obviously, this type of network can improve the performance of segmentation. However, it is more difficult to train. This network is also used for locating lesions in COVID-19 diagnosis [56] . Recently advanced attention mechanisms can learn the most discriminant part of the features in the network. Oktay et al. [67] propose an Attention U-Net that is capable of capturing fine structures in medical images, thereby suitable for segmenting lesions and lung nodules in COVID-19 applications. Training a robust segmentation network requires sufficient labeled data. In COVID-19 image segmentation, adequate training data for segmentation tasks is often unavailable since manual delineation for lesions is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this, a straightforward method is to incorporate human knowledge. For example, Shan et al. [58] integrate human-in-the-loop strategy into the training of a VB-net based segmentation network, which involves interactivity with radiologists into the training of the network. Qi et al. [53] delineate the lesions in the lung using U-Net with the initial seeds given by a radiologist. Several other works used diagnostic knowledge and identified the infection regions by the attention mechanism [57] . Weakly-supervised machine learning methods are also used when the training data are insufficient for segmentation. For example, Zheng et al. [50] propose to use an unsupervised method to generate pseudo segmentation masks for the images.
