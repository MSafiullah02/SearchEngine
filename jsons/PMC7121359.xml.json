Alternatively, a demand valve ventilator can be used and PEEP can be generated by high gas flows directed through a tube with increased resistance (the Coanda effect). NCPAP delivers a constant distending airway pressure throughout the entire respiratory cycle, while the patient is spontaneously breathing. It exerts its effects by: (1) increasing oxygenation and CO2 washout by expanding collapsed alveoli and recruiting lung volume; (2) reducing the work of breathing; and (3) preventing apnea by stabilizing the upper airways and chest wall, particularly in ex pre-term babies. NPPV is extensively delivered by piston-driven or turbine ventilators. During NPPV, patients can be completely controlled by the ventilator (total controlled ventilatory support) or the patient\u2019s spontaneous inspiratory effort triggers (assisted ventilatory support) the ventilator to provide a variable volume (volume-targeted ventilation) or pressure (pressure-targeted ventilation).",

Two recent physiological papers [11,12] demonstrated the effectiveness of NPPV in reducing inspiratory effort as evaluated by esophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure\u2013time product and esophageal tidal swings in children with ARF. In addition, the application of NPPV via nasal and/or facial mask was associated with significant improvement in breathing pattern and gas exchange.",

The underlying predominant mechanism is uneven or mismatched ventilation-perfusion in regional lung units. Hypoxemic respiratory failure mainly occurs in disorders characterized by parenchymal pathologies, such as bacterial and viral pneumonia, as well as in lower airway obstruction, such as bronchiolitis and status asthmaticus. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common agent responsible for pneumonia, although other microorganisms can play an important role. Pneumonia produces a reduction in lung volume, due to consolidation and/or atelectasis, leading to reduced lung compliance. Bronchiolitis occurs mainly in children of less than 2 years of age and respiratory syncytial virus is estimated to be the most frequent etiological cause. Bronchiolitis causes an increase in airway resistance with dynamic lung hyperinflation, but this pathology often also involves the lung interstitium, with reduced lung volume and atelectasis. Both pneumonia and bronchiolitis can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

In healthy children, the central respiratory drive and the ventilatory muscle pump exceed the respiratory load thus maintaining adequate spontaneous ventilation. However, if the force generated by the respiratory muscles pump (fatigue or weakness), or central respiratory drive is too low and/or the respiratory load is too high, the resulting alveolar ventilation may be inadequate, thus leading to hypercapnia [13]. This phenomenon can be \u201cacute\u201d, when the imbalance is caused by an acute condition (e.g., acute exacerbation of an asthmatic patient), or \u201cchronic\u201d, when the surge is slow during the course of a disease (e.g., a neuromuscular disease) [14,15].",

Unlike adults, to our knowledge no papers have been published to date in the pediatric literature on the use of NRS in the postoperative period. As a curative application, NRS should be initiated according to: (1) clinical signs: moderate- to-severe dyspnea and/or tachypnea (defined as a respiratory rate > the 75 th percentile depending on the age of the patient); and (2) gas exchange derangement: hypoxemia [defined as a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) > 0.5 to obtain a saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) > 94%] and/or respiratory acidosis (defined as pH < 7.35). Possible contraindications for NRS are: life-threatening hypoxemia; upper airway obstruction; vomiting; cough or impaired gag reflex; facial surgery, facial trauma, or facial deformity; Glasgow Coma Scale < 10; hemodynamic instability requiring inotropes or vasopressors, or cardiac arrhythmia; and cyanotic congenital heart disease. NRS should not be started in more severe ARF in the presence of: (1) clinical signs of exhaustion (active contraction of the accessory muscles of respiration with paradoxical abdominal and thoracic motion); and (2) a PaO2:FiO2 ratio < 150 mmHg and/or PaCO2 > 55 mmHg; and (3) pH < 7.30.",

Nasal prongs are typically used for the youngest patients: when directly inserted in the patient\u2019s nostrils, they are more effective for obligate nose breathers, such as newborns and young infants up to 1 year of life, in delivering continuous positive airway pressure. Normally this interface is easily kept in place without any other device, but nasal prongs are poorly tolerated for longer periods, are highly flow resistive (due to nasal anatomical resistance, to small airway resistance, and the high propensity of these patients to have hypertrophic adenoids and tonsils), and are easily obstructed by an excess of nasal secretions. Quite common side effects are bleeding, skin lesions, and nasal dryness due to airflow and nostril obstruction [3,16].",

It is a small, soft and transparent mask which completely covers the nasal surface, and through which it is possible to achieve proper fitting, minimal dead space, and minimal leaks; it is therefore useful for delivering both NCPAP and NPPV Skin lesions and mucosal breakdown are the more frequent side effects. Limitations in the use of a nasal mask include larger pressure drops due to the mouth opening [3] and the impracticability of nasogastric tube positioning [25]. In older patients (the so-called nonobligate nose breathers), oronasal masks covering both nose and mouth are more effective in minimizing air leaks and thus preserving the necessary pressurization of the respiratory system. The need for tightened straps to keep the mask in place is the main cause for patient discomfort and skin irritation. The recent introduction in the market of a full-face mask covering the entire facial surface is very promising, although no studies have been published in the pediatric population. Nasal masks, oronasal, and full- face masks need to be well-fitted to deal with leaks and discomfort, important problems that are not overcome by the use of hydrocolloid protection and that are exacerbated by facial deformities, facial trauma, and pre-existing facial lesions [8]. The recently introduced helmet is also promising in pediatric clinical practice. While its use is well established in the adult population [26,27] a few studies assessed its feasibility and effectiveness in pediatrics, both in PICUs and clinical wards, especially in acute bronchiolitis [23,28,29]. The helmet is a soft, transparent, pressurized plastic chamber that encloses the head and neck. It is easily applied in both nose and mouth breathers and in a wide range of ages and anatomical variations. Moreover, it warrants good patient-environment interaction, comfort, and reduced need for sedation in the treatment of ARF. Furthermore, the helmet allows good clearance of secretions, allows the patient to speak and swallow, and it is well tolerated for prolonged periods of application.",

One of the major challenges during NRS is to identify the early prognostic signs of treatment failure. In a 4-year study, Mu\u00f1oz-Bonet and colleagues [5] investigated several predictive factors of NRS failure in children from 1 month to 16 years of age with moderate-to-severe ARF. NRS failure was defined as the need for tracheal intubation. NRS was applied in 47 consecutive patients and failed in 9 (19.1%) due to the progression of ARF. Younger age, diagnosis of ARDS, and chest X-ray worsening at 24 h from the beginning of NRS correlated with treatment failure. The authors could also show that the association between mean airway pressure >11.5 cm H2O and FiO2 > 0.6 was predictive of NRS failure in nearly 80% of children.",

Out of 278 children (average age: 8.7 months) with ARF and treated with NRS, 129 received NRS as the sole ventilatory support, 98 were treated with NRS to prevent extubation failure and 48 because of postextubation ARF. Interestingly, 71.2% of children had an underlying chronic disease, probably reflecting the typical PICU population of a developing country. Overall, NRS avoided intubation in more than 75% of children. During this study, a high pediatric risk of mortality (PRISM II) score, the presence of sepsis, an abnormal respiratory rate, and a high requirement of FiO2 at NRS initiation were found to be independent predictive factors of NRS failure. Worsening respiratory failure and septic shock were the two leading causes of failure of NRS. The authors concluded that NRS represents an effective strategy to prevent tracheal intubation and for rapid discharge to the ward where respiratory treatment can be continued.",

At the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, 163 patients aged between 1 month and 18 years who received NRS during the 7-year study period, were evaluated to determine whether physiological parameters and an underlying condition predict NRS success [31]. Eighty-three children received NRS as firstline intervention to avoid intubation and 64% of them succeeded. Those who failed showed higher FiO2 (0.56 vs. 0.47, p = 0.038), higher respiratory rate (53.3 vs. 43.3 breaths/min,p = 0.012), and lower pH (7.26 vs. 7.34, p = 0.032) before NRS was started and higher FiO2 requirements once NRS was applied. Eighty patients were started on NRS to prevent postextubation failure and 60% were treated successfully. Those individuals who failed showed significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure 2 h after NRS start (104 vs. 77.9 mmHg, p = 0.001 and 64.5 vs. 54.1 mmHg, p = 0.037), probably representing a stress response in the worsening child.",

Looking at the underlying conditions, the authors demonstrated that children with a primary respiratory disease who were treated with NRS as the first-line treatment avoided intubation in 30/36 cases (83%), while those with an underlying oncological disease showed a much lower success rate (8/23 cases, 35%). The presence of sepsis further decreased the rate of success in the oncological group (3/15 cases, 20%). Patients with a primary respiratory illness were also more likely to avoid reintubation after extubation (27/33 cases, 82%). The authors concluded that tachypnea and acidosis prior to establishing NRS treatment and oxygen requirement pre- and post-NRS are the strongest predictive factors for treatment failure when NRS is used as the first-line treatment to prevent intubation. In contrast, when NRS is used to avoid reintubation, the most important predictive factor for reintubation is persistent hypercapnia after NRS initiation.",
