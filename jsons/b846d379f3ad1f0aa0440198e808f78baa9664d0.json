One colostrum-fed calf inoculated with pooled feces of the 5 affected cows, developed mild diarrhea, and shed rotavirus-like particles which reacted with antiserum to group B rotavirus in immune electron microscopy. Cell culture immunofluorescence tests, RNA-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and RT-PCR confirmed that this virus was bovine group B rotavirus, which was designated the Nemuro strain. Additional 2 colostrum-deprived calves inoculated with feces of the first calf also developed diarrhea and shed virus, suggesting that this group B rotavirus might be the etiological agent of the outbreak of adult cow diarrhea. The identities of the nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the Nemuro VP7 gene were high (93-95% in nt and 96-97% in aa) and low (61-63% in nt and 49-61% in aa) compared to those of the published corresponding genes from 3 bovine and 2 other mammalian (human and rat) strains of group B rotaviruses, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of bovine group B rotavirus in Japan. * Rotaviruses are assigned to 6 groups (A to F) based on antigenic and genomic analysis [2, 19] . Each rotavirus group possesses its own cross-reactive anti- *",

Detection of GBR is difficult compared to that of group A rotavirus (GAR) because:1) serial propagation of GBR in cell culture was unsuccessful except for one porcine strain [22] ; 2) the number of GBR in feces is usually very low [2, 19] ; 3) antisera to GBR are available only in a few laboratories. Therefore, in contrast to GAR, which are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in young animals and children [13] , the prevalence and characterization of GBR remains unclear. Bovine GBR have been reported only in the United States and the United Kingdom [3, 4, 7, 16, 20, 23] . Recent reports have suggested that GBR might be more associated with adult cow diarrhea than with calf diarrhea [3, 20] .",

These feces were also tested for GAR by latex agglutination tests (Rotascreen; Microgen Bioproducts LTD, Surrey, U.K.), and for Salmonella spp., Coccidium spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. by using standard techniques. Serum samples were collected from these cows at the acute and convalescent phases of the disease.

The number of nt differed from that of the other bovine ATI, Mebus and WD653 strains (811 nt), the human ADRV strain (814 nt), and the rodent IDIR strain (804 nt) of GBR. The number of aa corresponded to that of other bovine GBR (ATI, Mebus, WD653), and was 2 aa shorter and 1 aa longer than that of the ADRV and IDIR GBR, respectively. The nt identity of the Nemuro VP7 gene was 93-95% compared to the other 3 bovine strains, and 61-63% compared to the ADRV and IDIR strains. The deduced aa identity of the Nemuro VP7 gene was also high (96-97%) compared to the other 3 bovine strains, and low (49-61%) compared to the ADRV and IDIR strains. The 5 termini of these bovine VP7 genes were conserved. By contrast, the 3 terminus of the VP7 gene of the Nemuro strain was more similar to that of the ADRV and IDIR strains rather than that of the other bovine strains, which ended with \"CCC\". The hydropathicity profiles of the VP7 were similar between bovine and other mammalian GBR (data not shown). Multiple alignments of the deduced aa sequence of the VP7 from the 6 GBR were produced using the MEGALIGN program (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, U.S.A.) as shown in Fig. 5 . One potential N-linked glycosylation site located at aa residues 46-48 was conserved for all VP7. An additional one or two potential glycosylation sites were present in VP7 except for that of the WD653 strain. There was the putative signal cleavage site between Ala/Gly15 and Gln16 in the VP7 of all GBR, which was also present in the VP7 of GAR and GCR at aa residues 50-51 and 49-50, respectively [15, 25] . There were 7 cysteine residues in the VP7 of the Nemuro strain, and the locations of 5 were conserved in all GBR. [3] , ATI [3] WD653 [3] , ADRV [6] , and IDIR [18] strains were published previously Bovine GBR have been reported in association of diarrhea in calves and adult cows [16, 20] . Recently, Chang et al. [3] reported that bovine GBR was detected more frequently from diarrheal feces of adult cows than from those of calves. In this study, no association with other pathogens was observed in the adult cow diarrhea, suggesting strongly that bovine GBR might cause diarrhea in adult cows similar to bovine coronavirus. Interestingly, human GBR infections have been also associated primarily with disease in adults [2, 11] .",

These results suggest that the bovine GBR Nemuro strain can cause diarrhea in a 30-day-old calf.",

Similar results were observed in the present study. Thus, the time of sampling and highly sensitive assays are critical for accurate diagnosis of bovine GBR infections. Recently, Chinsangaram et al. [7] have reported the use of RT-PCR for the detection of bovine GBR infections. In our study using RT-PCR with identical primers, the expected PCR products were observed from fecal samples of all 5 affected cows, and for 5 days in experimentally infected calves. Furthermore, GAR and GCR were negative in this RT-PCR, which suggests that this assay is suitable for diagnosis of bovine GBR infection.",

We used several concentrations of trypsin and rolling cultures, but the virus could not be adapted to growth in MA104 cells.

For GCR, we have demonstrated a similar relationship among VP7 types [12, 25] . There is no information about serotypes in GBR. But, if VP7 serotypes exist among GBR as for GAR and GCR, the Nemuro bovine strain and other bovine strains (Mebus, ATI, and WD653) might belong to the same VP7 serotype, based on the VP7 aa identity of 92-97%. Also, these bovine strains and the other mammalian strains (ADRV and IDIR) might be classified as different VP7 serotypes because the VP7 aa identity among them was only 48-61%. In the VP7 genes from different species origin and also the other genes of the human ADRV and rodent IDIR strains of GBR, more sequence substitutions were observed than for GAR and GCR [8, 18] . These observations suggest that the GBR strains of different species origin may have had a longer period of time to diverge from one another, compared with GAR and GCR [8] . Although VP7 aa identity was very low among GBR strains from different species, the fundamental structure of VP7 in GBR was similar as revealed by: 1) similar hydropathicity profiles; 2) the conserved putative signal cleavage site; 3) 5 of 6 to 8 cysteine residues in GBR were conserved; 4) 1 of 1 to 3 potential N-linked glycosylation sites was conserved. Comparative analysis of the VP6 genes from bovine and other mammalian GBR is in progress.",
