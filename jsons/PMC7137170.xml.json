First comes the bold promise of the sulpha drugs, then the dawning of the antibiotic era proper with the discovery of streptomycin and the rediscovery of penicillin; then the sobering realisation that these wonder drugs could have an expiry date. In this story of antibiotic hope and \u201cantibiotic abandon\u201d\u2014to borrow James Whorton's prescient phrase\u2014certain scientists and drugs figure prominently: Selman Waksman and streptomycin, but also Gerhard Domagk and prontosil, Howard Florey and penicillin.",

To some extent this is understandable: despite being hailed in 1939 as a \u201chundred thousand times\u201d more powerful than the sulpha drugs, gramicidin proved highly toxic when administered intravenously and although it was widely used during World War 2 to treat wounds and other topical infections it was soon eclipsed by streptomycin.",

As such, it arguably has a greater claim than streptomycin to have launched the antibiotic revolution. Yet no sooner had Dubos unveiled gramicidin than he withdrew from research in this field, convinced that such antimicrobial agents would only encourage the growth of bacterial resistance. The result was that by 1943 Dubos was advising premedical students not to follow the example of their elder colleagues who practise \u201cthe wasteful and inconsiderate use of antibiotics\u201d, and by the late 1950s he was explicitly warning that \u201cat some unpredictable time and in some unforeseeable manner nature will strike back\u201d. Dubos thus presents a paradox for historians of antibiotics, disrupting the triumphant phase of the narrative and foreshadowing the tragedy that follows.",

But until Dubos, no one had thought to look for a purifying agent in the ecology of bacteria themselves. Educated at a French agricultural college, Dubos shared Pasteur's faith that germs can impede other germs. However, it was not until 1924 that a chance meeting with Waksman led Dubos to take up an offer to study for a PhD in soil microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. There he became adept at soil chemistry and bacteriology, so much so that when he arrived at the Rockefeller Institute in 1927 to help Oswald Avery's search for an agent that could decompose the polysaccharide capsule of the virulent type III pneumococcus\u2014the leading cause of lobar pneumonia\u2014he was bold enough to suggest he investigate whether such a principle existed in the soil. Accordingly, Dubos fetched mud from a New Jersey cranberry bog and, using a basic chemistry set and a few gardening techniques, cultivated a microbe that removed the pneumococcus capsule with an enzyme he dubbed S-III. By 1930, he and Avery had shown that S-III was able to completely cure mice infected with pneumonia. But just when it looked as if it might be purified into a therapeutic serum to treat humans, the enzyme was eclipsed by Domagk's discovery of prontosil, plunging Avery into despair. Yet it soon became apparent that prontosil and other sulpha drugs were potentially toxic when given in adequate doses, leading Dubos to seek a gentler alternative, and as before he looked to the soil for an answer.",

Now, he actively sought to see whether he could train, or domesticate, the microbes in the soil by repeatedly feeding them suspensions of staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. 2 years and countless soil samples later, Dubos was thrilled to see his soil contained a new bacterium, Bacillus brevis, that disintegrated the staphylococci, and from which he was able to isolate gramicidin and tyrothricin.",

Holding up a tiny bottle containing 500 g of his new bactericide, Dubos told his audience that it contained enough grey powder to protect 5 trillion mice against pneumonia and streptococcal infections. Never mind that tyrothricin had yet to be tested on humans, as The New York Times put it, Dubos's research \u201copens up a vast field in the search for chemical agents for fighting bacterial enemies\u201d.",

Dubos's announcement also stimulated Florey and Ernst Chain to look further into penicillin and persuaded Waksman to undertake his search using similar soil techniques that led to the eventual isolation of streptomycin. It is no exaggeration to say that no discovery contributed more to the faith in antibiotics and the conviction at mid-20th century that scientific medicine would soon eradicate all infectious diseases than Dubos's. It also established his scientific reputation, earning him the 1948 Lasker Award and election to the US National Academy of Sciences, no small feat for an agriculturally trained Frenchman without a medical degree.",

The reasons for Dubos's decision are unclear but seem to be motivated as much by personal reasons as intellectual conviction: while isolating tyrothricin, his wife, Marie Louise, suffered a devastating relapse of tuberculosis, partly, Dubos believed, as a result of the stress of the war and the loss of contact with her family in France, and in 1942 she died. Dubos could not believe that his wife had succumbed to an infection that she had harboured since childhood. Clearly, the tuberculosis bacilli alone could not explain her illness. Instead, Dubos vowed to explore the role of host factors and social and environmental disturbances in the pathogenesis of disease. Marie Louise's death also awakened Dubos's humanistic sensibility. The result is that today Dubos is better remembered for his popular writings linking human health with the environment and his catchphrase, \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d.",

Without his early appreciation of the transformational properties of microbes and the phenomenon of bacterial adaptation, it is unlikely that calls for more rational prescription practices in the face of relentless pharmaceutical marketing in the 20th century would have taken the form they did. Indeed, it was while at Harvard that Dubos drafted The Bacterial Cell, a book that was to have a seminal influence on the next generation of biomedical researchers, including Lederberg. In the book, Dubos challenged the then dominant notion of bacterial fixity and urged bacteriologists to take note of the plasticity of bacteria, warning that the widespread use of chemotherapeutics would favour the production of \u201cunsuspected variants, exhibiting all degrees of drug fastness and of pathogenicity\u201d. However, Dubos's starkest departure from then medical orthodoxy came in his 1959 book, Mirage of Health, in which he compared the faith in antibiotics to \u201cthe na\u00efve cowboy philosophy that permeates the wild West thriller\u201d and warned that complete freedom from disease was \u201calmost incompatible with the process of living\u201d.",

Dubos died in 1982 and therefore did not live to see the widespread community outbreaks of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or the resurgence of tuberculosis and pneumonia infections in the wake of AIDS. Fortunately, Lederberg had been paying attention and in the late 1980s he used his position as head of the Rockefeller University to revive Dubos's warnings about the mutability and adaptability of pathogens in the face of shifting disease ecologies and changing social patterns. Although Lederberg's main concern was new viral diseases such as AIDS, in a 1988 address at the Rockefeller he included the evolution of antibiotic resistance within a new category he termed \u201cemergent diseases\u201d. In this way, Lederberg reminded his audience of the relevance of Dubos's ideas to the present and restored him to his place in the history of both antibiotics and disease ecology.",
