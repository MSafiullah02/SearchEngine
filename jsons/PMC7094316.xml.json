Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have been detected in myocarditis lesions in man and apes, respectively (Barbaro et al., 1998, Yearley et al., 2006, Pozzan et al., 2009). However, the ability of HIV to infect cardiomyocytes is surrounded by controversy, as the entry pathway of HIV into these cells has not been established, given that they do not express CD4 receptors (Barbaro et al., 2001, Currie and Boon, 2003). Moreover, it is likely that other factors also play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of HIV-induced heart lesions, such as opportunistic infections, the immune response to the viral infection, cardiotoxic drugs, malnutrition and prolonged immunosuppression (Sani, 2008).",

Thus far, FIV has not been associated with lesions in the cardiovascular system. This study describes myocarditis associated with FIV infection in five cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Virus was detected in cardiac lesions via immunohistochemistry (IHC). The myocarditis associated inflammatory infiltrate was characterized using cell markers for lymphocytes and macrophages.",

The breed, sex, age, clinical signs and gross lesions observed in the five cats with myocarditis and HCM are shown in Table 2\n. Clinically, the majority of animals had dyspnoea (cats 1, 2, 3 and 5). One cat also exhibited restlessness (cat 2), while one only displayed lethargy and anorexia (cat 4) and suffered from vomiting. All of the animals died spontaneously and did not receive any treatment, except for cat 5 that was treated with antibiotics because of suspected pneumonia due to dyspnoea. Among the other 17 cats with heart lesions, 15 were of mixed breed and two were Persians, 11 were male and six were female and the average age was 6.2 years. At necropsy examination, all cases had marked cardiomegaly, accentuated concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and pallor of the myocardium and epicardium (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). Cat 3 had pericardial effusion containing fibrin strands. A thrombus in the right atrium was observed in cat 5. All of the animals had red, aerated lungs, which released large volumes of red fluid when sectioned. Hepatomegaly (cats 2 and 5) and blue-tinged (cats 3 and 5) or pale (cat 4) mucosae, in addition to hydrothorax (cats 3, 4 and 5), were also noted. The abdominal aorta of all animals was examined, but there was no evidence of thrombosis in any case.",

However, a positive immunoreaction was observed in the dendritic and interstitial cells in only one case of myocarditis of undetermined cause (Pozzan et al., 2009). The comparatively higher rate of identification achieved using PCR may be related to the greater sensitivity of this technique. Here, the performance of IHC was satisfactory in that it afforded a good degree of sensitivity, with positive immunoreaction being observed in all cats with myocarditis.",
