They use a large armoury of immunoregulatory molecules to subvert the protective immune responses of the host and minimize severe pathology [1], [2]. Some of these helminth-derived modulators of human immune responses have great potential as new therapeutics. For example, ES-62, a secreted glycoprotein product of the rodent filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae, has broadly anti-inflammatory properties that inhibit Th1 cytokine production in experimentally induced arthritis in mice [3]. ES-62 is currently being developed as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic [4]. In another nematode, body fluid from the pig roundworm, Ascaris suum, contained potent activity that stimulated IL-10, which is characteristic of Th2 and regulatory T cells. The parasite products reduced the inflammation caused by experimentally induced delayed type hypersensitivity in mice [5].",

While conducting experiments designed to evaluate recombinant Onchocerca volvulus ASP-1 (rOv-ASP-1) as a possible vaccine candidate against onchocerciasis in humans, we vaccinated mice with the recombinant protein alone or with alum or Freund's adjuvants and measured IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes that are broadly associated with Th2 and Th1 T cell responses, respectively. rOv-ASP-1 stimulated both IgG1 and IgG2a antibody responses to the protein itself, with a slight Th1 dominance [11]. Since these effects occurred in vaccinated mice in the absence of adjuvant, we asked the question whether the protein could act as an adjuvant to assist unrelated proteins in inducing antibody responses. Until the present study, purified products from helminths have been found to be strong inducers of exclusively Th2 responses.",

Inclusion bodies containing insoluble rOv-ASP-1 were treated with 6 M urea at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and the urea-soluble rOv-ASP-1 was then further purified by preparative SDS\u2013PAGE on a PrepCell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The protein-containing fractions were eluted in Laemmli buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) and analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE. Fractions containing the purified rOv-ASP-1 were identified by INDIA\u2122 HisProbe-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, IL) chemiluminescent Western blotting, and protein concentrations were determined using detergent-compatible protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Although the rOv-ASP-1 protein at working dilutions tested negative for bacterial endotoxin using a Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), we sent a sample for quantitative LPS testing following FDA guidelines to Cambrex Bio Science (Baltimore, MD). Testing revealed that there was a residue of 0.44 Endotoxin Units (EU)/\u03bcg rOv-ASP-1 protein. At a dose of 25 \u03bcg/mouse, therefore, the animals would receive 11 EU per injection which is well below the FDA accepted limit of 50 EU/mL for biologicals. However, to definitively exclude any possibility of residual LPS in rOv-ASP-1 contributing to any adjuvant effects, we batch-treated the concentrated stock solution (2.5 mg/mL) of rOv-ASP-1 three times with LPS-removing gel (Detoxi-gel\u2122 system, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), and adjusted the protein concentration accordingly. Repeat testing by Cambrex showed no detectable LPS in the treated rOv-ASP-1 preparation and a single batch was used throughout the experiments presented here.",

            "text": "We first used ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma, Grade V) as a model antigen that does not stimulate appreciable antibody responses when injected into mice without adjuvants. The peptide derived from the spike (S) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), designated CP-1 [12], was synthesized by a standard solid-phase FMOC method in the Microchemistry Laboratory of the New York Blood Center. CP-1 spans amino acids 1153\u20131189 of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region of the SARS-CoV S protein, which plays an important role in fusion between the virus and target cell membranes [12]. The FLSC polypeptide is a chimera of the full-length HIV-1 BaL gp120 and the first and second extracellular domains (D1D2) of soluble CD4 joined by a 20-amino acid linker. This polypeptide faithfully duplicates the structural, functional and antigenic properties of the native gp120-CD4 complex intermediate that arises during HIV replication and enables binding to CCR5 on target cells [13]. FLSC inhibited binding of HIV-1 in vitro to target cells expressing CCR5 [13]. Therefore, the antibodies directed against FLSC may block HIV-1 binding to CCR5. A plasmid expressing the FLSC protein was kindly provided by Dr. A. Pinter at the Public Health Research Institute with the permission from Dr. A.L. DeVico at the University of Maryland. A stable cell line expressing recombinant FLSC was established by transfecting the plasmid into 293T cells using FuGene 6 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacture's protocol. Soluble FLSC was purified from cell culture medium by lectin chromatography with Galanthus nivalis snowdrop agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as described [14].",

All immunized mice were given two boosts this time to optimize the response to the small 37-mer CP-1 peptide, i.e. a total of three injections of CP-1 or FLSC with rOv-ASP-1 as the test adjuvant or MPL + TDM as a control. Using OVA as the control antigen, the end-point titres were about 2,096,000 and 1,024,000 when r-Ov-ASP-1 and MPL + TDM were used as adjuvants, respectively. These total IgG titres were approximately 10 times higher than in the previous experiments, suggesting that an additional boost significantly enhances antibody production. The adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 for the CP-1 peptide exceeded that of MPL + TDM judging by end-point IgG titres of 256,000 versus 64,000, respectively (Fig. 4\nA).

MPL + TDM induced a higher IgG2b titre to FLSC than rOv-ASP-1, whereas IgG1 and IgG3 titres were the same using both adjuvants.

The fact that we can induce Th1 responses in this strain with rOv-ASP-1 but not MPL + TDM encouraged us to investigate whether we could obtain similar results in other mouse strains that are not as Th2-biased. In recent preliminary studies using OVA-immunized C57BL/6 mice which favour Th1 responses [16], rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant was associated with a Th1-dominated (IgG2a) antibody response to OVA but also with considerable IgG1 titres (IgG1:IgG2a = 0.5). The antibody response to OVA in Balb/c mice was Th2-skewed (IgG1) but, as in the data presented here, there was also a significant IgG2a component (IgG1:IgG2a = 3.0). Thus, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant augments both Th2 and Th1 antibody responses in mice with the overall balance dependent on the genetic background of the immunized animal. We have used a range of doses of rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant; 2.5 \u03bcg/mouse was not significantly active for antibody responses and 10 \u03bcg/mouse gave adjuvanticity intermediate to the final dose that we chose (25 \u03bcg/mouse).

Ov-ASP-1 is highly expressed in the infective O. volvulus third-stage larva (L3) [15], but its precise role in the invasion process is not known. The early human response to first exposure to live L3 of Brugia malayi, another filarial nematode, has recently been shown to be Th1-dominated. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF were increased on exposure to L3 in vitro but not T cells expressing Th2 cytokines [17]. It is possible that L3-secreted ASPs are involved in the stimulation of the Th1 cytokines. In support of this, we found that rOv-ASP-1 is a potent stimulator of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF) from O. volvulus-na\u00efve human PBMCs (unpublished data). The mechanism responsible for the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 is not yet clear, however, from our studies using human PBMC we know that the protein binds to a subpopulation of monocytes. It is possible that rOv-ASP-1 exerts a direct activating effect on antigen-presenting cells and we are currently investigating this and the potential role of toll-like receptors in binding rOv-ASP-1.",
