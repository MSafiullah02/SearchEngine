Further, by targeting distinct pain pathways, improved efficacy may also occur. Early administration of parenteral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) has been observed to decrease opioid requirements, pneumonia incidence, both hospital and ICU length of stay, and the number of ventilator days [9\u2022, 10\u2022]. However, there has been a paucity of data to suggest a clear benefit to using agents such as anticonvulsants, lidocaine patches, or ketamine. Nonetheless, according to the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and Trauma Anesthesiology Society (TAS) joint practice management guideline for pain management for blunt thoracic trauma, the use of multimodal analgesia is conditionally recommended for adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma despite the low quality and limited evidence [11\u2022]. Thus, it is reasonable to implement this mode of analgesia in lower-risk patients \u2013 age < 65 years old, < 3 rib fractures, no significant pulmonary compromise, and no comorbidities [1, 12\u201314] \u2013 and in conjunction with a regional anesthetic technique.",

Several other recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews of RCTs have confirmed these findings [17\u2022, 18\u2022, 19]. Furthermore, differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation and pulmonary complications such as pneumonia and empyema have also been questioned [20\u2022]. In fact, in a matched analysis examining over 1000 patients with traumatic rib fractures, McKendy et al. found that epidural analgesia was associated with an increase in pulmonary complications [21\u2022]. Despite these findings, EAST/TAS guidelines currently recommend placement of epidural analgesia over non-regional modalities based on very low-quality evidence, emphasizing the importance of patient preference [11\u2022].",

TEA is contraindicated in patients with hypotension, hypovolemia, coagulopathy, significant spinal or traumatic brain injuries, and systemic infection, all of which are common in the multi-trauma patient. Placement of TEA is particularly associated with hypotension, mainly due to a reduction in systemic vascular resistance from the blockade of sympathetic output. This can result in significant hemodynamic compromise, especially in the under-resuscitated patient. Moreover, the technically demanding nature of this procedure may pose challenges in a patient with multiple injuries and sites of pain. Finally, it is important to consider the risks of dural puncture, motor blockade, pruritis, and urinary retention.",

Many institutions have adapted TPVBs as a means to manage patients with multiple rib fractures because of its relative technical ease, liberal anticoagulation guidelines, lower incidence of sympathectomy, preservation of bladder sensation, and absent risk of spinal cord injury. Furthermore, since there is sparing of lumbar and sacral nerve roots, TPVB can be performed in patients who require neurological assessment for concomitant spinal cord compression [22, 27\u201329].",

The complication rate is low and has been described as comparable to that of epidural and intercostal nerve blocks [32]. It can be argued that complications associated with TPVBs are less detrimental than those of neuraxial techniques. For example, hypotension that can occur with TPVBs requires less medical intervention than the expected sympathectomy associated with TEA. Nonetheless, there remains the risk of pneumothorax, pleural puncture, inadvertent bilateral blockade, and vascular puncture [28]. With the advent of ultrasound technology and its utility in more precise TPVB placement, TPVB may have an improved safety profile compared to TEA.",

The clinical presentation of tension pneumothorax can include severe dyspnea and air hunger in the awake patient, through to cardiovascular collapse (especially in mechanically ventilated patients). The presence of tension pneumothorax should be actively excluded in all trauma patients during the initial primary survey and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any unanticipated deterioration of a trauma patient. The diagnosis should be made on clinical grounds with signs including absent or reduced breath sounds in the affected hemothorax; distended neck veins (noting that this may be absent if the patient has concurrent hypovolemic shock); tracheal deviation away from the affected hemothorax; of hyper-resonance, which may be difficult to demonstrate clinically but can be useful to differentiate from a massive hemothorax (another cause of unilateral absent air entry).

The traditional teaching has been needle decompression via the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line; however, there are several problems with this approach. Firstly, the overlying soft tissues in this location are such that a standard 5 cm cannula will not reach the pleura in up to 30% of patients [51, 52]. Secondly, in an emergency, clinicians frequently misjudge where the mid-clavicular line is and will tend to approach too medially, risking injury to major vascular structures and the internal mammary artery [53]. For these reasons, the Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons has revised their recommendation in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS\u00ae) 10th edition [54] to suggesting the fourth or fifth intercostal space between the mid- and anterior axillary lines as the optimal site of decompression in adults (the previous second intercostal space recommendation remains for pediatric patients). They have also recommended finger thoracostomy as an alternative approach. Finger thoracostomy is similar to the initial steps in surgical intercostal drain placement: the skin is prepped and ideally anesthetized, a small 3\u20134 cm incision is made along the superior border of the rib, and a sterile gloved finger is introduced, bluntly dissecting until the pleural space is entered.

This injury can result in a mixed form of shock with hypovolemia from bleeding, as well as an element of obstructive shock from impaired venous return due to the high pressure exerted within the pleural space (similar to a tension pneumothorax). Management involves the decompression of the pleura by the placement of an intercostal drain, with the concurrent restoration of volume utilizing a hemostatic resuscitative approach [56\u2022\u2022].

This decelerative force can cause aortic transection (which is almost universally fatal at the scene), as well as intimal tears or pseudoaneurysms. Blunt aortic injury is most commonly identified during arterial phase CT imaging of the chest [57]. Traditionally, these would be primarily managed with blood pressure control; however, technological advances and increasing experience in the use of endoluminal stent grafts have led to endovascular management as the most common method of managing blunt aortic injury [58]. Given the significant energy transfer generally associated with blunt aortic injuries, other injuries are common (and in the case of the hypotensive patient, alternative injuries are the most likely cause rather than the aortic injury). Because blunt aortic injuries are frequently asymptomatic, a high index of suspicion based on the mechanism of injury should be maintained until ruled out by adequate CT imaging.",

Although myocardial contusion is the most common manifestation of blunt cardiac injury, a range of injuries can occur, including myocardial rupture, valve rupture (leading to acute valvular regurgitation), and coronary artery dissection. It is also reasonably common for a primary medical event to lead to trauma, for instance, the elderly patient who crashes their car while suffering a myocardial infarct.",

Rib fractures are a frequent occurrence and are a marker of energy transfer and underlying injury. Pain from rib fractures can result in impaired ventilation and oxygenation, so the mainstay of treatment is good quality analgesia. A plethora of regional analgesia options are available, all with associated benefits and risks. The optimal regional analgesia technique is as yet undefined, although there is increasing evidence for paravertebral catheters. Myofascial plane blocks have become increasingly popular and offer a favorable risk and side-effect profile, although the evidence supporting the efficacy of this technique is currently limited.",
