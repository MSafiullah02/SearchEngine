Colic, leukopenia, and changes of fecal character have also been reported [[3], [4], [5]]. Although the clinical signs of horses affected by ECoV during outbreaks has been reported in detail [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]], less is known about the clinical manifestation of this infection in adult horses in nonoutbreaks situations [4,6]. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the clinical presentation of horses diagnosed with ECoV that were admitted to a tertiary hospital, but were not associated with a known outbreak.",

Hematological (white blood cells count, band and mature neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, red blood cells count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, fibrinogen, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood distribution width, and platelets) and biochemical parameters (lactate, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, and anion gap) for each case were also recorded. Lactate measurements were performed using a stall side analyzer (Lactate Plus Nova; Medical Innovation House, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). All blood work was performed on site (Clinical Pathology Laboratory, WSU-VTH) at or within 24 hours of patient admission, and all blood smears were reviewed by a board-certified clinical pathologist. Transabdominal ultrasound (MyLabAlpha; Esaote, Indianapolis, IN) findings, treatments administered, secondary complications, days of hospitalization, final diagnostics and outcome were also included.",
