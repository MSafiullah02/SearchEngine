Given that the envelope flow around a building is highly fluctuating, mean values could be insufficient to describe interunit dispersion. This study investigates the wind-induced interunit dispersion around multistory buildings using the large eddy simulation (LES) method. This is the first time interunit dispersion has been investigated transiently using a LES model. The quality of the selected LES model is seriously assured through both experimental validation and sensitivity analyses. Two aspects are paid special attention: (i) comparison of dispersion routes with those provided by previous RANS simulations and (ii) comparison of timescales with those of natural ventilation and the survival times of pathogens. The LES results reveal larger dispersion scopes than the RANS results. Such larger scopes could be caused by the fluctuating and stochastic nature of envelope flows, which, however, is canceled out by the inherent Reynolds-averaged treatment of RANS models. The timescales of interunit dispersion are comparable with those of natural ventilation. They are much shorter than the survival time of most pathogens under ordinary physical environments, indicating that interunit dispersion is a valid route for disease transmission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The transient characteristics of interunit dispersion revealed by LES simulations have significantly increased our current understanding of this type of dispersion.

Later, a series of wind tunnel experiments (Liu et al., , 2011a Wang et al., 2010) revealed that wind-induced interunit dispersion could occur along both horizontal and vertical directions. However, it was difficult to take accurate measurements of the indoor concentration level in a wind tunnel experiment using highly reduced-scale models (Mfula et al., 2005) . Considering the uncontrollable boundary conditions of an on-site measurement and the scale problem of wind tunnel experiments (van Hooff and Blocken, 2010) , and Ai and Mak (2014a) used CFD methods to study the wind-dominated interunit dispersion around multistory buildings. Their CFD results identified typical interunit dispersion routes and quantified re-entry ratios, demonstrating the severity of interunit dispersion. Their studies also suggest that the CFD method is a suitable research tool for the study of interunit dispersion. However, they used RANS models and thus only obtained mean dispersion routes and re-entry ratios. Considering the highly fluctuating characteristics of a coupled indoor and outdoor flow (Ai and Mak, 2014c; Etheridge, 2011; Haghighat et al., 1991 Haghighat et al., , 2000 Linden, 1999; Straw, 2000) , the mean results may not be sufficient to describe an interunit dispersion process.

In addition, these smaller aerosols have a chance to deposit in the lower respiratory tract and thus could cause serious negative effects on human health (Tellier, 2006; Thomas, 2013) .

The discretization method for the pressure and diffusive terms is a second-order scheme, whereas a second-order bounded central-differencing scheme is used for the convective term. A second-order implicit scheme is used for temporal discretization. Finally, the pressure-velocity coupling method is SIMPLEC. The convergence of each time step is achieved when both the area averaged wind speed and CO 2 concentration at the opening of the source unit are stable for at least five iterations. Based on the converged mean flow and concentration fields generated by a RANS model, the transient simulation of flow and concentration fields using the LES model continues for a sufficient period of time (approximately 3 flow-through time T ft , namely 1200Dt* in the present study) to avoid the influence of initial conditions and to obtain statistically stable average results, where T ft = D L /U H with D L the domain length and Dt* is the non-dimensional time step size, defined as Dt* = Dt 9 U H /H with Dt the time step size.

Table 2 compares the reattachment lengths on the roof and on downstream ground of bluff bodies under a normal wind condition. Comparison between the LES results with the two sets of experimental data generally justifies the present LES simulations of flow field around the multistory buildings. The deviations between the LES predictions and the experiments could be attributed to two reasons: (i) The configurations of the physical models are different and (ii) there are real units and openings in the present building models, whereas the experimental models are solid blocks. Figure 5 provides examples of the time series of ACH values and tracer gas concentrations of certain units in the multistory buildings. It can be seen from Figure 5a that the ACH value of a unit is always highly fluctuating. Detailed analyses of the fluctuating behaviors of a single-sided ventilation rate as well as the transient flow patterns around a single opening, under various wind directions, can be found in Ai and Mak (2014c) . Owing to the highly fluctuating flow field, it is necessary to analyze the interunit dispersion transiently. As shown in Figure 5b , the continuous release of tracer gas in a source unit (namely WM3) results in a quick elevation of the concentration level in that unit, and the accumulated tracer gas then starts to transmit to adjacent units (e.g., WEd3) at a later moment. Such interunit dispersion would eventually achieve a dynamically stable state. The times that separate the whole evolution period into the pre-stable period and the dynamically stable period are carefully identified through sensitivity tests. When a time is identified, the linear regression is made on a concentration curve within the dynamically stable period. A final time is selected if further changing this time results in no more than 5% of deviations to both the coefficient and the R 2 value of the regressed linear equation. For all wind directions, these final concentration levels in other units are, on average, two to four orders of magnitude lower than those in the corresponding source units. Figure 6 provides examples of the evolution of reentry ratios over time after releasing tracer gas, where the maximum, mean, and standard deviation values of re-entry ratios within the dynamically stable periods are also calculated. Three observations can be made based on these time series of re-entry ratios. First, the re-entry ratio of a specific unit is always fluctuating, implying that using a mean re-entry ratio to describe an interunit dispersion is inaccurate. Second, the fluctuating intensities of re-entry ratios within the dynamically stable periods differ between different units, as indicated by the standard deviation values. The reentry characteristics during the dynamically stable periods are analyzed in Section 'Results and analyses: dispersion routes and re-entry ratios'. Third, there may be a large difference in the times when the re-entry ratios reach the mean value in different units. Such timescales of interunit dispersion are analyzed in Section 'Results and analyses: time scales of interunit dispersion'.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1142, "end": 1160, "text": "Ai and Mak (2014c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 152, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 724, "end": 732, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 880, "end": 889, "text": "Figure 5a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1293, "text": "Figure 5b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2255, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and analyses: general flow and dispersion characteristics"}, {"text": "This section analyzes the interunit dispersion characteristics during the dynamically stable periods.

Figure 7a presents the results on the windward side under a normal wind direction, when the tracer gas is released from unit WM3. The asymmetrical results occur between the two end units. Normally, velocity and pressure fields are easy to achieve aerodynamically symmetrical results, while the asymmetrical phenomenon likely appears on concentration field. Some previous wind tunnel experiments also found that asymmetrical concentration results exist between geometrically symmetrical observing locations (e.g., Liu et al., 2010) . The possible reason for this difference is that the concentration transport is governed by more complex transport mechanisms than the velocity and pressure fields. Recently, it was found that there is an Table 2 Comparison of reattachment lengths on the roof and on downstream ground Method Physical model (X:Y:Z) L R /L L W /L X Z Leitl and Schatzmann (1998) important concentration transport mechanism, namely the countergradient mechanism (i.e., tracer gas transports from low-concentration areas to high-concentration areas), see, for example, Gousseau et al. (2011b) . However, it is believed that further studies to explain the occurrence of the asymmetrical results are still necessary. These results presented in Figure 7a may lead to three conclusions. First, without balconies, the tracer gas disperses in all directions around the source unit, namely upward, downward, and lateral directions. This finding is inconsistent with previous RANS results (Ai and Mak, 2014a; , which show only downward dispersion. Such a difference between the findings of the RANS and LES simulations could be attributed to the inability of the RANS models to interpret the transiently fluctuating flows that deviate from the mean flow. Second, a unit with a very small mean re-entry ratio could occasionally experience very large re-entry ratios, such as unit WEd2 with R k and c R k equal to 0.9% and 16.5%, respectively. This is an important finding, demonstrating that the mean RANS results are insufficient to describe real infectious risk circumstances. Third, the presence of balconies significantly aggravates the transmission to the two lateral units on the same floor of the source unit. Their presence shrinks the infectious scope, evidently because of their blockage and channel effects. Figure 7b presents the results on the leeward side under a normal wind direction, when the tracer gas is Fig. 7 Mean and maximum re-entry ratios of tracer gas from source units to other units during dynamically stable periods; R k represents mean re-entry ratio and c R k maximum re-entry ratio released from unit LM2. Similar to the windward side, the stochastic and fluctuating flows induce dispersion in all directions around the source unit. This, again, does not accord with previous RANS results, which suggest only upward dispersion. In particular, downward dispersion is found, which is produced by unsteady interaction between the large recirculation vortex behind the building and the small corner vortex at ground level (Ai and Mak, 2014c) . Unlike on the windward side, the presence of balconies broadens the infectious scope and elevates the re-entry ratios. This should be attributed to the fact that the negative wake region helps the leeward balconies accumulate and preserve the tracer gas. Figure 7c presents the results on the windward side under an oblique wind direction, when the tracer gas is released from unit WEu3. Without balconies, the tracer gas mainly disperses downstream, along which many units could be dangerous. This finding updates previous RANS simulations, which detected infections only in the two downstream units on the same floor as the source unit. Through the channel effect, the presence of balconies limits the dispersion to a smaller number of units, particularly to those on the same floor, which is very useful for the control of infection. Figure 7d presents the results on the leeward side under an oblique wind direction, when the tracer gas is released from unit LM2. Although the dispersion is only limited to the units on the floor above the source unit in the building without balconies, it is dangerous for almost all units in the building with balconies, except for those on the floor below the source unit. As under normal wind direction, the presence of balconies has the disadvantage of diluting the tracer gas. Such a large difference in dispersion characteristics between buildings with and without balconies (also other similar envelope features) should be given special attention in developing control measures. Figure 7e presents the results on a lateral side under a parallel wind direction, when the tracer gas is released from unit Ed2. The tracer gas released from the source unit disperses mainly in upward and upstream directions, although the downward dispersion is still significant. Units along these directions could suffer from re-entry and thus be dangerous. The presence of balconies dramatically intensifies the dispersion in the downstream units, while it slightly mitigates the dispersion in other units. For both buildings, the infectious scopes predicted by LES simulations are much larger than those given by RANS simulations (Ai and Mak, 2014a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 638, "end": 655, "text": "Liu et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 990, "end": 1017, "text": "Leitl and Schatzmann (1998)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1229, "text": "Gousseau et al.

As re-entry ratio R k is related to an ACH ratio, it could be very large even at the beginning of tracer gas release, see Figure 6 . Therefore, although R k is useful to evaluate the dispersion characteristics during the dynamically stable periods, it is not sensitive to reveal time characteristics. This study uses the concentration ratio M i-j between an infected unit and the source unit to examine the timescales of interunit dispersion. Figure 8 presents the non-dimensional times required to reach both the mean and the half mean M ij values of the relevant units. The non-dimensional times have the same definition with that specified in the caption of Figure 3 . Figure 8 shows two aspects worthy of discussion. The first is the influencing factors of the distribution and magnitude of the timescales. For a specific unit, the timescales do not show an obvious relation with its distance to the source unit and the approaching wind direction. However, the timescales on the buildings without balconies scatter at a larger range than those with balconies. The relatively uniform distribution of timescales on the buildings with balconies should be ascribed to the fact that the balconies disturb the near-wall flow, resulting in a more dynamically stable envelope concentration field. Generally, under the normal and oblique wind directions, the timescales on windward sides are shorter than those on leeward sides, as larger pressure fields near the windward sides intensify quick dispersion of the tracer gas. The second aspect is the magnitudes of these timescales. The magnitudes of T \u00c3 h values are mostly comparable with those of natural ventilation. Based on the present physical model, the non-dimensional times required to achieve one whole-unit air replacement for the typical naturally ventilated ACH values of 5, 10, and 20 are 53.3, 26.7, and 13.3, respectively. Here these ACH values occur commonly in naturally ventilated buildings (Ai et al., 2015; Niu and Tung, 2008) . Such comparable magnitudes are to be expected as interunit dispersion occurs based on the natural ventilation system and the interunit dispersion is governed by the indoor and outdoor airflow exchange mechanisms. Table 3 provides a summary of the timescales required to reach specific M i-j values. From the viewpoint of the control of infection, there is a negligible difference in the timescales between different cases. Among these timescales, the ranges of T \u00c3 0:0001 are particularly interesting, representing the times required to achieve M i-j values of 1:10 000. Considering that a respiratory process, such as coughing and sneezing, can produce millions of aerosol particles (Duguid, Table 3 .

This variation is stochastic, implying that the incursion of pollutants into a specific unit is intermittent. Such characteristics significantly broaden the dispersion scope and thus increase the difficulty of control. Second, there could be secondary interunit dispersions around multistory buildings, as shown clearly in Figure 9e ,f. Secondary dispersion could be an important mechanism of interunit dispersion. It indicates that a portion of pollutants entering a specific unit could come from an infected unit, rather than directly from the source unit. This feature also contributes to extending dispersion scope and increases dispersion uncertainty.

Such re-entry quantities in various circumstances are provided in the present study. However, the present study cannot provide a universal safe threshold for the re-entry ratio to estimate the infectious risk for a specific unit, as the size of a quantum is strongly related to the type of pathogen and the physical condition of susceptible persons. Previous studies by Franz et al. (1997) showed that many pathogens can cause disease with several to dozens of organisms, such as viral hemorrhagic fevers (1-10), Q fever (1-10), tularemia (10-50), brucellosis (10-100), and smallpox (10-100). For highly infectious bacteria like M. tuberculosis, even a single organism is sufficient to cause disease, while a cough may produce around 3000 organisms (Duguid, 1946; Fitzgerald and Haas, 2005 ).

Another aspect that is important to the estimation of airborne infectious risk is the ratio of two timescales: the timescale required to accumulate a quantum and the timescale of the pathogen's survival. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the two timescales have not been compared previously. The prerequisite of the occurrence of an airborne infection is that at least a quantum of organisms produced by an infector must remain both airborne and survive to be inhaled by a susceptible person (Tang et al., 2006) . If the pathogen's survival time is shorter than the timescale needed to accumulate a quantum of this pathogen in a target unit, the occupants in this unit are safe and thus no protective measures are required. Unfortunately, previous data have shown that many pathogens can survive in aerosols for a very long time, such as human coronavirus 229E, which survives for several to dozens of hours (Ijaz et al., 1985) ; influenza viruses, which survive for up to 24 h (Loosli et al., 1943) ; and SARS coronavirus, which survives for more than 7 days (Lai et al., 2005) .
