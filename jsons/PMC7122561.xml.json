Resuscitation with intravenous fluids is often necessary in critical care for maintenance of perfusion during shock or hypovolemic states. In recent years, a shift toward early recognition of sepsis has encouraged rapid and early initiation of fluid at illness presentation with the hopes of improving outcomes. As a consequence, aggressive early fluid resuscitation can contribute to fluid overload states in the setting of critical illness. Recent literature in both adult and pediatric patients suggests that fluid overload in critical illness can have harmful effects and contribute to morbidity and mortality [1]. However, the definition and management of fluid overload remain unclear, likely reflecting the complex relationship between volume resuscitation, fluid distribution, and critical illness.",

The percentage of water per body weight fluctuates with age, such that premature infants and term newborns have higher total body water relative to adults, which rapidly decreases to adult values during the first year of life [2]. The intracellular space accounts for 55% of total body water, while the remaining 45% exists within the ECS. The ECS is further divided into three compartments: intravascular space or plasma (IVS), interstitial space (ISS), and transcellular space (TCS), which account for 15%, 45%, and 40%, respectively, of total extracellular fluid. The transcellular space refers to digestive, cerebrospinal, intraocular, pleural, peritoneal, and synovial fluids [3]. The movement of water between the three compartments of the extracellular space occurs through a semipermeable membrane [4].",

This relationship is illustrated through the use of Eq. 11.1. In this assumption, transvascular exchange depends largely upon a gradient between oncotic and hydrostatic pressure. At the arterial end, the dominant pressure gradient present is that of a hydrostatic pressure differential, and therefore, the driving force for fluid movement is away from the higher capillary hydrostatic pressure and toward the lower interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure. Fluid movement in this direction is termed filtration (Fig. 11.1) [4].\n",

This differential in oncotic pressure at the venule end of the capillary is greater than the hydrostatic differential, and so there is reversal of flow based on an overall pressure gradient that leads to absorption of fluid back into the intravascular space [4]. This process is summarized in Fig. 11.2. The Starling concept of filtration and absorption for fluid movement is demonstrated in Fig. 11.3.\n\n",

            "text": "Despite Starling\u2019s principles of fluid movement being generally considered the standard, in 2004, Adamson and colleagues revised the Starling equation, theorizing that non-fenestrated capillaries filter fluid throughout their entire length into the interstitial space and that absorption through the venules does not occur despite a rise in capillary oncotic pressure, which is unable to overcome hydrostatic forces. Therefore, there is no true reversal of filtration. Instead, filtered fluid circulates throughout the interstitial space and largely returns to the circulation as lymph [5]. This principle for fluid movement is influenced by substances that exist in the multiple layers between the interstitial space and intravascular space [5]. These layers include a subglycocalyx space which is largely protein-free and an endothelial glycocalyx space which consists of a matrix of glycoproteins and proteoglycans. The endothelial glycocalyx layer serves as a semipermeable membrane separating plasma from interstitial space. Rather than gradients between the interstitial oncotic pressure and intravascular oncotic pressure that serve as a driving force for fluid movement, it is the subglycocalyx capillary oncotic pressure (\u03c0s) that serves as the major determinant in transcapillary flow (Jv) [5]. This model and the function of the endothelial glycocalyx in fluid movement are illustrated in Fig. 11.4. Further research into the translation of this model into clinical practice could lead to improvements in the management of fluid status in critically ill patients.\n",

While it has a variety of medical applications, bioimpedance has been proposed as a method to evaluate for fluid status due to its ability to estimate total body fluid and extracellular fluid. However, although multifrequency bioimpedance has been reported as a reliable measure of estimating body water compartments in adults [10], the pediatric literature to support its use remains sparse. Milani et al. recently attempted to evaluate the use of multifrequency bioimpedance measurements in pediatric patients requiring maintenance dialysis and found that measurements of body water compartments were imprecise when compared with gold standard measurements of bromide or deuterated water dilution, two methods which, while accurate, remain impractical for daily clinical use [10].

When fluid intake or output measurements are unavailable or incomplete, daily weight measurements can be substituted as a reliable method to measure fluid overload. Regardless of the method of fluid overload measurement, interpretation of fluid status still requires clinician expertise, particularly in settings where physical exam and calculated values are discrepant. The child in the scenario above experienced a significant inflammatory response and capillary leak secondary to her infectious process which predisposed her to pulmonary edema and fluid overload. It is not uncommon for critically ill patients to have intravascular volume depletion concurrent with total body fluid overload. Therefore, despite signs of fluid overload on clinical examination, if the patient were to remain hypotensive or unable to tolerate diuresis, it would be suggestive of ongoing low intravascular volume despite overall fluid overload which would alter clinical decision-making regarding the timing of diuresis or fluid removal therapies.",

In 1992, Singh et al. evaluated in a prospective randomized controlled trial continuous versus intermittent furosemide in postoperative pediatric cardiac patients. Patients were randomized to either IV intermittent (1 mg/kg furosemide every 4 h to be increased by 0.25 mg/kg every 4 h to a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg) or continuous IV infusion (0.1 mg/kg/h of furosemide doubled every 2 h to a maximum of 0.4 mg/kg/h) to maintain urine output >1.0 mL/kg/h. Data showed that those who received the continuous infusion had less variability in urine output and required a lower cumulative daily dose of furosemide, suggesting that continuous infusions may be more advantageous in this patient population [13]. Klinge et al. attempted to replicate this evaluation with 57 postoperative cardiac patients in a prospective, randomized study. Patients were given either intermittent IV furosemide or a continuous infusion of furosemide when urine output fell to less than 1 mL/kg/h and CVP was more than 5 cmH2O. Patients in the intermittent IV furosemide group required less furosemide over the 3-day study period (1.2 mg/kg/day vs 1.8 mg/kg/day) to achieve the same, targeted urine volume of >1 mL/kg/h [14].

Ethacrynic acid, which can be used as an alternative to other loop diuretics in the setting of sulfa drug allergies, has been studied dating as early as the 1960s. The mechanism of action is identical to furosemide and other loop diuretics \u2013 direct reversible blockade of Na/K/2Cl binding sites in the thick ascending loop of Henle. Ethacrynic acid has been reported to be 30% less potent than furosemide [15]. Ethacrynic acid was studied in 22 children aged 2\u201317 years of age with congestive heart failure. They reported 3.6% average weight loss in patients administered with ten intermittent doses of ethacrynic acid, with an increase in urinary volume by a factor of 2.5 over a 24-h period and with minimal electrolyte abnormalities [16]. In 2015, Ricci et al. performed a prospective randomized double-blinded study on 74 pediatric patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery comparing furosemide versus ethacrynic acid. Patients were included in the study if they had clinical signs of fluid overload and randomized to either receive furosemide or ethacrynic acid, with primary outcome measuring mean urine output on postoperative day 0. Urine output was noted to be higher among patients who received ethacrynic acid (6.9 mL/kg/h) compared with furosemide (4.6 ml/kg/h, p = 0.002) despite a lower cumulative dose of ethacrynic acid (0.22 mg/kg/h vs 0.33 mg/kg/h, p < 0.0001), suggesting that less ethacrynic acid may be required to achieve the same urine output as furosemide in this patient population. The occurrence of AKI was not statistically significant between groups, and no complications linked to electrolyte disorders were observed in either group. Based on these data, it can be concluded that ethacrynic acid is at least as efficacious as furosemide in children recovering from cardiac surgery and may have a role in other critically ill patient populations such as those with sulfa allergies. It is important to note however that ethacrynic acid is currently markedly more expensive than furosemide which, in the current health-care climate, will be a barrier to its use.",

Aminophylline is a methylxanthine that functions as a diuretic by acting as an adenosine receptor antagonist, which serves to increase renal blood flow and inhibit solute reabsorption. In cases of oliguria refractory to traditional loop diuretics, there is some thought that aminophylline may help increase efficacy of loop diuretics by promoting dilation of afferent glomerular arterioles and increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [18]. Pediatric and neonatal studies confirm benefits of adjunctive therapy of aminophylline when used in combination with furosemide therapy. Pretzlaff et al. administered a bolus of 6 mg/kg of aminophylline to pediatric patients aged 2\u201346 months of age with fluid overload who were concurrently treated with furosemide infusions of \u22656 mg/kg/day. Theophylline levels were measured as peak levels 30 min after administration. The mean peak level was 8.3 mcg/mL, and urine output was positively correlated with theophylline level. After administration, patients were noted to have a significant increase in urine output (>80%) during the first 2 h [19]. A neonatal case study described five infants, 26\u201338 weeks of age, receiving furosemide infusions at 0.2\u20130.6 mg/kg/h with ongoing oliguria who were loaded with 4 mg/kg of aminophylline and treated with increasing doses until diuresis was achieved. All infants demonstrated weight loss, reduction of mean airway pressure, and FiO2 requirements, along with the resolution of pleural effusions. Aminophylline may therefore be helpful for patients with ongoing fluid overload despite loop diuretic therapy. For patients who receive multiple doses of aminophylline in this setting, monitoring of serum concentrations based on traditional protocols to prevent toxicity would be prudent.",

Implementation of RRT for critically ill children who become anuric or develop accepted criteria for dialysis (i.e., life-threatening hyperkalemia or uremia) secondary to AKI is the standard of care and, accordingly, not controversial. Use of RRT, however, in the setting of fluid overload in patients without anuria or other definite criteria for dialysis is more debatable. Studies in pediatric patients have shown that the percentage of fluid overload prior to initiation of therapy is independently associated with survival in all patients receiving CVVH or CVVHDF [1, 20, 23]. For example, in one retrospective study of critically ill children with multiorgan dysfunction, fluid overload was independently associated with mortality; fluid overload was 15.5% in non-survivors versus 9.2% in survivors (p < 0.01) [1]. Adult studies have shown similar findings. In one prospective study of adult patients, 90-day mortality was doubled among those who had fluid overload at the time of RRT initiation (identified as greater than 10% fluid overload) [20]. Another adult study demonstrated that increased positive mean daily fluid balance after RRT initiation was also associated with increased mortality [23]. Despite these studies and others on the use of RRT with AKI and fluid overload, the ideal timing for initiation of RRT therapies remains unclear. Perhaps more importantly, it has not been clearly demonstrated that RRT utilization for fluid overload leads to improvement in survival outcomes. A meta-analysis in 2008 evaluating all randomized controlled trials available in adult literature regarding the utilization of RRT demonstrated a mortality risk reduction that was inadequately powered to demonstrate statistical significance [24]. A similar systematic review of adult data performed in 2011 looked to compare early versus late initiation of RRT and showed an association with reduced mortality, but results were complicated by significant statistical heterogeneity [25].",

Diuretic medications, with furosemide generally accepted as the first-line agent, can be beneficial in improving urine output. Method of administration (continuous vs intermittent IV) can be based on provider preference and patient factors (e.g., hemodynamic stability, available intravenous access sites, etc.). Adjunctive treatment with aminophylline may be considered in refractory oliguria in patients already receiving traditional diuretic therapies. While current literature does not support RRT implementation based solely on the percentage of fluid overload, it should be considered as therapeutic option for fluid removal in patients with persistent or worsening fluid overload greater than 10% of pre-illness weight despite maximal medical therapy. As the use of CVVH and CVVHDF becomes more commonplace, improved research will hopefully allow for better developed algorithms to dictate fluid removal therapies in the critical care setting.",

This predisposition can vary based on many factors including the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities that may be present. Neonates are at particular risk to develop fluid overload due to their increased total body water distribution and renal immaturity. Indeed, fluid overload can occur early in the postoperative period, tending to develop more readily in patients that are younger with cyanotic heart lesions and/or worse kidney function at baseline [35]. Many of the children with these risk factors also have complex lesions requiring longer CPB durations. Prolonged exposure to CPB and the stress of surgery augments the postoperative inflammatory response and consequent capillary leak, likelihood of low cardiac output, and AKI, making fluid overload almost unavoidable in some cases. In a recent retrospective review of 193 children who underwent cardiac surgery, the amount of fluid administered in the first 6 h of ICU admission after surgery was the strongest independent risk factor for fluid overload by postoperative day 2 [36]. In one of the largest prospective studies to date focused on this issue, which examined characteristics and outcomes of 1525 children who underwent cardiac surgery over a 4-year period at a single institution, Lex et al. noted that patients who were more likely to develop fluid overload greater than 5% were significantly younger (median 151 days versus 448 days) and smaller (4.3 kg versus 8.4 kg) and had longer duration of CPB (131 min versus 78 min) and aortic cross clamp (69 min versus 39 min) and lower urine output on postoperative day 1 (1.7 mL/kg/h versus 2.6 mL/kg/h) [37].

Emerging evidence suggests that early dialysis, particularly with peritoneal dialysis (PD), may have benefits to postoperative cardiac patients [39]. A single-center retrospective study of 146 neonates published in 2012 reported that children with AKI after cardiac surgery in which PD was started early (within the first day) had lower 30- and 90-day mortality rates [40]. Of note, 52 complications related to PD were recorded in 44 patients in this study including dysfunction of the catheter (leakage at the insertion site, displacement, or insufficient drainage), hydrothorax, hemoperitoneum related to insertion or withdrawal of the catheter, bowel perforation, and peritonitis. More recently, in an unblinded trial by Kwiatkowski et al., 73 infants with postoperative oliguria (defined as 4 total h of urine output <1 mL/kg/h during the first postoperative 24 h) were randomized to receive either PD or furosemide therapy. Patients who were restricted to furosemide treatment were more likely to develop 10% fluid overload, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and prolonged CICU stay. Also, patients who received PD had fewer electrolyte abnormalities, though two PD-related adverse outcomes were observed \u2013 peritoneal bleeding requiring a blood transfusion and hydrocele formation [39].",

Significant fluid overload in postoperative cardiac patients is common and associated with worse outcomes. While fluid overload may be unavoidable in some patients, efforts to minimize the degree of fluid overload are appropriate. For institutions that have the resources and experience to readily implement PD in the early postoperative period, careful risk factor assessment could drive the creation of PD protocols for this patient population. As experience with this modality increases and more data become available, many of the risks associated with PD may decrease, and centers may be more inclined to offer this modality more frequently. In the meantime, conservative fluid management, early initiation of diuretic therapy, and careful attention to daily fluid balance and weight measurements are necessary to temper the risks of fluid overload in children recovering from cardiac surgery.",

Neonatal studies of children with pulmonary hypertension on ECMO have suggested that edema and fluid mobilization play a role in persistently poor respiratory function and duration of ECMO [43, 44]. Selewski and colleagues retrospectively evaluated fluid overload in 756 pediatric ECMO courses at 6 centers within the United States and Canada. In this study, patients who died while on ECMO had significantly greater peak fluid overload while on ECMO, greater change in fluid overload during their ECMO course, and greater fluid overload at time of ECMO discontinuation. More importantly, in a multivariable analysis, peak fluid overload while on ECMO independently predicted mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04\u20131.15); and both fluid overload at ECMO initiation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05\u20131.22) and peak fluid overload (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12\u20131.24) predicted hospital mortality, independent of AKI [45]. Though the study population was largely neonates and the diagnosis of AKI was made using serum creatinine values, these multicenter data highlight a potential effect of fluid overload on morbidity and mortality.",

Current CRRT devices can easily be utilized in conjunction with the ECMO circuit, eliminating access as a barrier to its use in this patient population. As a result, many centers have a low threshold for initiating CRRT for ECMO patients. Studies have shown that neonatal ECMO survivors receiving CRRT had an overall better fluid balance and received less diuretic therapy compared with non-CRRT survivors [46]. A systematic review performed of all published literature regarding CRRT and ECMO showed that ECMO survivors receiving CRRT therapy had an overall fluid balance that was less positive compared with those not on CRRT but also noted studies showing longer ECMO duration when CRRT was applied [47]. Additionally, other studies have shown an increased association between mortality and concomitant CRRT on ECMO [48, 49]. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a prospective RCT will be conducted on the use of CRRT in ECMO patients, as there is no consensus on accepted indications for initiation and practice varies considerably across centers. The risk/benefit ratio must be evaluated for each patient accounting for resource availability, nutritional needs, and the potential for worsening intravascular volume depletion, which can further exacerbate AKI and negatively affect the function of the ECMO circuit.",

Furosemide therapy is generally accepted as the first-line diuretic agent, but persistent or worsening fluid overload despite conservative fluid management and furosemide therapy should prompt adjunctive treatments or RRT.Further research of the effects of fluid overload and its management in specific patient populations and disease states is required to improve our practice and decrease variations in care across centers.\n",
