            "text": "Worldwide outbreaks of infectious diseases necessitate the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. Colorimetric assays are a representative tool to simply identify the target molecules in specimens through color changes of an indicator (e.g., nanosized metallic particle, and dye molecules). The detection method is used to confirm the presence of biomarkers visually and measure absorbance of the colored compounds at a specific wavelength. In this study, we propose a colorimetric assay based on an extended form of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) self-assembly shielded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) under positive electrolyte (e.g., 0.1 M MgCl 2 ) for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This platform is able to verify the existence of viral molecules through a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) shift and color changes of AuNPs in the UV\u2212vis wavelength range. We designed a pair of thiol-modified probes at either the 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032 end to organize complementary base pairs with upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frames (ORF) 1a on MERS-CoV. The dsDNA of the target and probes forms a disulfide-induced long self-assembled complex, which protects AuNPs from salt-induced aggregation and transition of optical properties. This colorimetric assay could discriminate down to 1 pmol/\u03bcL of 30 bp MERS-CoV and further be adapted for convenient on-site detection of other infectious diseases, especially in resource-limited settings.",

The best way for containment of the epidemic is an early diagnosis, which is difficult using ordinary methods because of costly and large equipment, the necessity of experts, and slow data output. 4 Therefore, rapid POCT methods are crucial for overcoming these limitations by miniaturizing and reducing the device cost and providing simple, fast, easy-to-use diagnostic tests without specialized training.",

            "text": "Colorimetric detection originating from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been intensively studied because of their particular optical properties, i.e., localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which represent a color with maximal absorbance wavelength. AuNPs have been utilized in colorimetric assays for the detection of diverse biological molecules (e.g., proteins 5 and nucleic acids 6 ) in that the change in particle color is generated by sensitive reactivity of nanosized particles to external condition. In addition, the disperse state is adjustably modified from artificial electrostatic force control by ion, pH, biomacromolecules, and so forth. 7, 8 For example, a positive electrolyte (salt) causes metallic nanoparticle aggregation, causing a significant color change as a red-shift in the LSPR spectrum. 9,10 Based on that, a modified AuNP cross-linking method was demonstrated in Mirkin's group for DNA identification. 11 In the research, the surfaces of AuNPs were conjugated with two thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) via strong Au\u2212S interactions. The hybridization of target DNAs with the ssDNAs on the surface of the AuNPs induces the formation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-AuNP networks, resulting in AuNPs aggregation and dramatic color changes. The target DNA acts as a crosslinker between two ssDNA-functionalized AuNPs. On the other hand, colorimetric DNA sensing methods using functionalized AuNPs have been demonstrated using noncross-linking DNA hybridization with the benefit of the powerful salting-out effect of dsDNA compared to ssDNA. 12 Since the ssDNA density on the surface of AuNPs and the ionic strength of the solution affect the stability of functionalized AuNPs, control of the aggregated state by modification is quite difficult in practical applications. Rothberg et al. suggested a label-free detection method based on the fact that ssDNA in the solution could bind to citrate-capped AuNPs and electrostatically stabilize them at high ionic strength. In such a system, AuNPs are stabilized in the presence of ssDNA, but aggregated with dsDNA in a highly concentrated electrolyte solution. This strategy does not need the direct binding of ssDNA on the surface of nanosized metallic particles, as the DNA amplification step prior to detection is inevitable due to the low sensitivity of this method. 13 Since both ssDNA and dsDNA allow AuNPs to stabilize at low salt concentration, 14\u221217 cationic agents are mainly used to identify the target with probes. 18, 19 In this regard, Farhad Rezaee et al. demonstrated a modified non-cross-linking AuNP aggregation using disulfide self-assembly of terminal modified DNA. Long and flexible sulfur-rich, self-assembled products were well combined on the surface of AuNPs and effectively inhibit the particles from salt-induced aggregation. 15 Inspired by this research, we developed a colorimetric assay that relies on bare AuNPs that employs a disulfide-induced self-assembly. The bare AuNP-based colorimetric method consists of two thiol modified probes at the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 ends for targeting partial genomic regions (30 bp) of MERS-CoV along with upstream E protein gene (upE) and encoding open reading frames (ORF) 1a. This assay could be highly reliable for MERS-CoV diagnosis as we have followed WHO updated recommendations for infectious disease laboratory testing, which targets the two regions on MERS-CoV considered for potential preclinical screening and high sensitivity 20 The developed assay platform was able to detect the target DNA through optical properties of the gold nanoparticles such as color changes with the naked eye and spectral shifts on UV\u2212 vis wavelength. The specific thiolated probes form the complementary dsDNA with the target and make a disulfideinduced long self-assembled complex due to continuous disulfide bond formation. The extended self-assembled complex can protect bare AuNPs for stability against saltinduced aggregation since sulfur-group at ends of dsDNA are mediated covalent bond with gold surface. The interaction is known to generate stable conjugation within disulfide-induced self-assembled complex and AuNPs and intermolecular force between Au\u2212S attains about 40 to 50 kcal mol \u22121 . 21, 22 Otherwise, probes build a disulfide induced interconnection with each other in the absence of targeting DNA. The probe DNA terminal coupling is unable to cover the surface of AuNPs exposed to aggregation, leading to significant color changes as well as a broader red-shift of the LSPR peak ( Figure  1 ). With this method, we can visually observe the results with the naked eye, not using costly equipment. This colorimetric assay is an important step to use of infectious disease POCT across the developing world. Moreover, this concept of a disulfide bond based colorimetric assay could be applied for diagnosis of other infectious diseases. ",

We changed the volume of trisodium citrate acid from 300 to 1600 \u03bcL to acquire different-sized AuNPs. The morphology of the prepared AuNPs and DLS records are reported in Figure 2a .

Since the LSPR spectral band of nanosized metallic particle is derived from dielectric factors, particle size and shape, the absorption peak shift indicated a changed environment surrounding AuNPs such as by conjugation of biomolecules. Thus, the addition of MgCl 2 induces a significant change in the absorption spectra. For example, the LSPR band has a decrease in intensity and increase in bandwidth, as well as new bands at longer wavelength. These LSPR band shifts represent the aggregation of AuNPs caused by the loss of interparticle repulsive force as salt disrupts the charge interaction surround AuNPs and promotes the interparticle van der Waals attractive forces. 26 As shown in the salt induced results, the solutions of gold nanoparticles, excluding 19 nm AuNPs, became gradually transparent due to severe aggregation of metal particles and also a broader, flattened spectra appeared in the UV\u2212vis measurement as Figure 2c . Therefore, we selected the 19-nm-diameter AuNPs that detected the LSPR changes on the surface of the nanosized metallic particles in this experiment.",

In this report, bare 19-nmdiameter AuNPs were used, and we selected a target and control upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frames (ORF) 1a on MERS-CoV, and the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), respectively. Furthermore, we synthesized forward and reverse thiol modified probes specifically binding the target DNA and forming complementary base pairs. Each of the thiolated probes were modified at the 5\u2032 site (Right: 5\u2032R) and 3\u2032 site (Left: 3\u2032L). Once two probes simultaneously recognize a specific half of the target, the disulfide bonds at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminals readily form a sulfurrich self-assembled complex. Specifically, target DNA samples were mixed with thiolated probes (5\u2032 R, 3\u2032 L) in distilled water (D.W.) and then incubated at 90\u00b0C for a few minutes to establish disulfide-induced long self-assembled products. 90 \u03bcL of the AuNPs solution was then add to the above-mentioned mixture (60 \u03bcL).

            "text": "We analyzed the color of the resulting solutions with the naked eye and UV\u2212vis spectrometer. Disulfide self-assembled products were visualized along with the gel electrophoresis, where the presence of the target (positive reaction) displayed bands with a characteristic ladder due to the formation of long assemblies of dsDNA (Figure 3a) . Polymorphous bands appeared with the formation of disulfide self-assembly between the target and probes on original full-length native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis image ( Figure  S1 ). Additionally, we confirm the sizes of DNA fragments with 4% agarose gel which is commonly used to separate and visualize the amplified DNA outcomes depended on number of base pairs ( Figure S2 ). Furthermore, we confirmed the adsorbed components on the surface of gold nanoparticle via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 3b ). In the case where thiolated probe met the incompatible DNA, the S 2p signals mainly indicated the absorbed thiol component at S 2p3/2 photoelectron binding energy (BE) of 162.2 eV since a sulfur monolayer was formed on the surface of AuNPs from the probe solution (S\u0305 , SH\u0305 , or SH 2 species) (Figure 3b(i) ). 28, 29 Meanwhile, XPS spectrum can be fitted at 163.37 and 164.55 eV of S 2p3/2 binding energy when target DNA and probes compose the disulfide-induced self-assembled multilayers on AuNPs (Figure 3b(ii) ). The observed components at 163\u2212164 eV of BE are assigned to some S in multilayer which highly defect to the gold surface or domain boundaries. 29, 30 Although BE of 163.7 appeared in Figure 3b (i), the area in the XPS spectrum was lower than thiol species (1:0.64), and in PAGE, the size of DNA fragments only appeared close to 20 bp ladder that indicates thiol containing short layers formed, not the disulfide based multilayer, and unbound thiol assigned that BE of S 2p 3/2 when target DNA is absent. 31 Also, the increased area at higher binding energy indicates higher coverage with absorbed polysulfides. 22 Based on results mentioned earlier from PAGE and XPS analyses, disulfide-induced self-assembled complex composed the multilayers on AuNPs, but thiolated ssDNA probes form monolayer which is hard to cover the surface of gold nanoparticle from salt-induced aggregation. DLS measurements also supported the size increasing of DNA covered AuNPs which depended on extended layers ( Figure  S3 ). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to monitor the distribution of the hydrodynamic size of the gold nanoparticles after immobilized ssDNA or dsDNA complex layer on the gold surface, respectively. As shown in Figure S3 , the average hydrodynamic size of the gold nanoparticle protected by disulfide-induced self-assembly from the positive reaction was increased by approximately 8.11 nm compared to immobilized ssDNA on gold nanoparticle from the negative reaction. The stability of the assay was investigated through the addition of various concentrations of MgCl 2 into the bare AuNPs solution in the (i) absence or (ii) existence of the target (Figure 3c ). Mixed products with target DNA and probe solutions shielded the particles, which tolerated the salting more than gold nanoparticles conjugated with thiol from disulfide-interconnected probes, since the disulfide-induced self-assembled complex was used to protect bare AuNPs against salt addition. The spectral peak of the AuNPs colloid was not quite different with bare AuNPs when the target DNA is in the solution with 0.05 to 0.5 M MgCl 2 , while AuNPs linked to disulfide-interconnected probes aggregated with any concentration of salt. However, the absorbance declined slightly, corresponding to an increased salt concentration whether extended disulfide assemblies were formed or not. Therefore, the spectral centroid shifts depending on salt concentration were plotted and are shown in Figure 3d . At all concentrations (0.05 to 0.5 M), the delta centroid of the negative control showed more shift than positive controls due to intergold nanoparticle aggregation, while the centroid shift of the positive control was the smallest at 0.1 M of MgCl 2. As previously mentioned, the absorbance declined conversely according to the increase in salt concentration. Hence, 0.1 M of MgCl 2 was chosen as the optimized concentration.",

To consider the disulfide self-assembled reaction dependence on target DNAs and their concentrations, we measured the absorption change of the AuNP solution before and after adding 0.1 M MgCl 2 in the presence or absence of each target using a UV\u2212vis spectrometer. When the target was absent, the wavelength was shifted more toward the red side of the spectrum compared to when the target was present. The wavelength peak shifts were 11, 19, and 51 nm after complementary binding reactions between probes and (i) ORF1a, (ii) upE, and (iii) TMV, respectively ((i) 522 to 533 nm, (ii) 520 to 541 nm, and (iii) 521 to 572 nm) (Figure 4a,b) . Due to the broad spectrum of the negative control, delta centroid was estimated as 2.5 times greater than a positive reaction (avg. 29 nm vs avg 12 nm). These changes indicate that positive samples (ORF1a and upE) that are a mixture of thiol-modified probes and their target DNA that hindered the aggregation of AuNPs through composition of the long self-assembled structures. Negative samples (TMV) were unable to form long self-assembled structures due to mismatched targets. Furthermore, we calculated a p-value to prove the reproducibility of this colorimetric platform (Figure 4b ). The p-value is the probability that might yield the same results observed in the biological study, if the null hypothesis is true. All data groups were found to pass the null-hypothesis assuming a normal distribution was followed. 32 Therefore, the p-value of the delta centroid implies that this assay is considered statistically significant (p-value <0.01).",

We proposed a colorimetric assay using disulfide bonds formed by hybridizing with thiolated probes and a target; this method inhibited the aggregation of AuNPs by salt and limits the color change for diagnosis of MERS. This assay can confirm the presence of MERS-CoV within 10 min without electrophoresis or other procedures. The assay could discriminate MERS-CoV with a potential detection limit of 1 pmol/\u03bcL, which means it could distinguish a lower amount of target with a lower level of amplification, or even without amplification. A follow-up study will be conducted to apply this method to clinical samples with longer targeting regions. We anticipate that this method will provide rapid and accurate diagnostic results in epidemic areas, especially in resource-limited settings and will evolve by ",
