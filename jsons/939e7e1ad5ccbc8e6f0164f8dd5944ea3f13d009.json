In order to more fully understand ARDS, it is important to consider how the lungs function. As one breathes, air is taken in through the nose and mouth and passes down the windpipe into alveoli within the lungs. It is in the capillaries that run through the alveoli that oxygen passes into the blood stream and is carried to all parts of the body. In ARDS, the capillaries within the lungs leak more fluid than normal into the alveoli and prevent the lungs from delivering enough oxygen into the blood stream. The consequence is that the body's organs work poorly or not at all. Fig. 1 summarizes the delivery of hemoglobin-based oxygen molecules to peripheral tissues in a normal patient's capillary and in a COVID-19 patient's capillary [14] .",

At sea level the blood (plasma) oxygen concentration is 0.3 mL per deciliter [18, 19] . Tissues at rest extract 5 to 6 mL of oxygen per deciliter of blood, assuming normal perfusion [18, 20] .

In addition, a recent metaanalysis of clinical trials revealed that HCQ treatment among patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus significantly reduced their levels of hemoglobin A1c (glycated hemoglobin decreases the oxygen carrying capacity and limits oxygen tissue delivery) [37] .

Acetazolamide inhibits the re-absorption of these ions, and hence, by increasing the blood level of bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic.

A significant percentage of the mortality associated with COVID-19 is related to respiratory conditions. At present, respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments for respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite such treatments of COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions, a high mortality rate is still being observed. It is hypothesized that there are underlying pathological changes among COVID-19 patients that are compatible with ARDS. A series of alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinical available treatments such as HBOT, pRBC transfusions, or ESAs were hypothesized to deliver increased oxygen to peripheral tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator support therapeutic treatments. Fig. 2 provides an overview of the mechanism of action for the various novel treatment strategies for respiratory conditions in Fig. 1 . A summary of hemoglobin-based delivery of oxygen molecules to peripheral tissues in a normal patient's capillary and in a COVID-19 patient's capillary. Hb = hemoglobin; O 2 = oxygen; SaO 2 = arterial oxygen saturation; SvO 2 = venous oxygen saturation. The oxygen tension of tissues will dedictate whether one of several oxygen molecules will be released from oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2 ) and diffuse from the capillary (pink area) into the tissue. The fraction of HbO 2 relative to total Hb in arterial blood is the SaO 2 , which is normally > 95%. Normal mixed SvO 2 is about 65-75%. A decrease in SvO 2 usually indicates low tissue oxygen tension, resulting in increased extraction of oxygen molecules from Hb. COVID-19 patients. It is recommend, given such alternative therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions. It is also recommend that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions. Fig. 2 . A summary of novel treatments considered to improve hemoglobin-based delivery of oxygen molecules to peripheral tissues in a COVID-19 patient's capillary. Hb = hemoglobin; O 2 = oxygen. It is hypothesized that hyperbaric oxygen therapy will significantly increase O 2 levels in the blood independently of Hb levels and improve tissue oxygenation. It is also hypothesized that packed red blood cell transfusions or injected erthropoiesis-stimulating agents will significantly raise blood Hb levels by increased numbers of red blood cells and improve tissue oxygenation.",
