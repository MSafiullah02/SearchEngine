Recently, multiple reports have demonstrated the evidence of extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs, but little is known about viremia. Results: In this study, a total of 532 fecal samples and 120 serum samples from healthy pigs were collected and tested from 2013 to 2015 in Guangxi province, China; of these 300/532 (56.4%) and 7/120 (5.8%) of fecal samples tested positive for PAstVs, respectively. Our study revealed that there was wide genetic diversity and high prevalence of the virus in the pig population. All five of the known PAstVs genotypes (1-5) prevailed in the pig population of Guangxi province and were distributed in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to sows, with PAstV2 (47.7%), PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%) seen predominantly. Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1b and partial capsid sequences from fecal and serum samples revealed that they were divided into the five lineages. Among these genotypes, based on partial ORF2 genes sequencing 23 strains were grouped as PAstV1, including 6 serum-derived strains, and were regarded as the causative agents of viremia in pigs.",

AstVs are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, about 28-30 nm in diameter, whose genome contain three open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1b code for nonstructural proteins, a protease and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively [3] . ORF2 codes for a highly divergent capsid protein which is formed in response to the immune pressure from the host [3] . Moreover, the genome also includes a 5\u02ca-untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u02ca-UTR and a poly-A tail.",

In particular, human astrovirues (HAstVs) have been recognized as the second most common cause of viral diarrhea in young children, the first being rotaviruses [3] . Porcine astroviruses (PAstVs) belong to the genus Mamastrovirus and were identified for the first time in 1980 by electron microscopy [4] . Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the full length ORF2 capsid protein, PAstVs are divided into five genotypes (PAstV1-PAstV5) circulating in the worldwide [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In 2010, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classified PAstV1 as Mamastrovirus 3 [10] . However, the other four genotypes of PAstVs have not been confirmed to exist in which species of Mamastrovirus [10] . Astroviruses are detected relatively more often in diarrheic pigs as opposed to healthy ones [11, 12] , but there is lack of more evidence to clarify the direct or indirect association of PAstVs with diarrhea [13] . Besides, there was more evidence of extra-intestinal infection of AstVs, it is worth noting that AstVs are detected in the central nervous system (CNS) presenting with encephalitis in various cases involving humans [14] [15] [16] , mink [17] , cattle [18] [19] [20] , pigs [21, 22] and sheep [23] . Additionally, PAstVs were also detected in serum [24, 25] and in the respiratory and circulatory systems of animals [24, 26] .",

Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on these obtained nucleotide sequences compared with the selected AstV sequences from other species available in GenBank, respectively. Clearly, five clades corresponding to the five PAstV types were delineated in two phylogenetic trees ( Fig. 1a and b Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences from the 3\u02ca-terminal conserved region of partial ORF1b gene segments revealed that there were four known genetic lineages circulating in the pig population of Guangxi province (Fig. 1a) . In the clade of PAstV2, they were classified into three subclades (PAstV2a, PAstV2b and PAstV2c). A total of 32 strains were distant with the deer or bovine astrovirus strains (PAstV2b), but genetically closer to characterized PAstV2 strains IA122 and 43 from the USA [8] and SF55 from Croatia [5] , sharing 74.9-79.6% nucleotide identity with each other. Besides, this branch included the serum-derived JGMZ17 strain, which was slightly distant from the serum-derived strain of Croatia [24] with an average nt identity of 85.9%. Another subclade (PAstV2c) clustered with strain JHW-1 from Shanghai [27] and 4-2 from Hungary [28] sharing 87.3 and 79.8% of the mean nt identities, respectively. The subclades of PAstV2a and PAstV2c were more closely related to porcupine astrovirus (KJ571486) and bat astrovirus (KX702367) detected in China respectively [29, 30] , sharing 88.7 and 60.4% of the mean nt identities, respectively.",

On the other hand, there was a comparable lower prevalence in South Korea (19.4%) [7] , Germany (20.8%) [36] and Sichuan province of China (17.5%) [6] . The present overall positive rate in our study reached 56.4% (300/532), and this encompassed 28 farms from nine regions/cities without a history of diarrhea. This rate is similar to the detection results seen in the Hunan province of China. Moreover, it was found that all five PAstV types were circulating in Guangxi province of China from 2013 to 2015. It was found that PAstV2 (47.7%) showed the highest prevalence, followed by PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%), which became predominant among five PAstVs genotypes and was detected from suckling pigs to sows. This finding is similar to the results seen in Sichuan [6] , which is different from the reports from Hunan [12] , suggesting that the dominance type of PAstVs varies with the different geographical locations, such as PAstV4 in the USA [8] and South Korea [7] and PAstV2 in Croatia [5] . There was low prevalence of PAstV3 (5.3%) and PAstV4 (10.5%) which existed in nursery and suckling pigs, respectively. Notably, there is no report regarding PAstV3 in China, with its first detection being noted in this study. This phenomenon is similar to what had been reported previously in other nations [5, 33, 37] . The low positive rate of PAstV4 was significantly different from the Xiao's report, which displayed the higher prevalence of 62.3% in all age groups [8] . The application and efficiency of the different primers used for detection might be mainly responsible for the differences observed in the two studies. The specific primers for genotyping will be necessary to investigate the presence of different genotypes of PAstVs. In addition, the pig population selected, the density of selected farms, Fig. 3 Phylogenetic tree based on the complete nucleotide sequences of the ORF2 genes (capsid) of four PAstVs.

PAstV2, PAstV4 and PAstV5 have also been found in the blood of healthy pigs [24, 25] . Moser et al. showed that infection with human astrovirus could increase the intestinal barrier permeability in a Caco-2 cell culture model system, suggesting that other astroviruses might use the same way to enter the bloodstream [39] . Our study brings new knowledge about viremia caused by PAstVs which is different from genotype reported from Croatia [24] . Six serum-derived samples belonged to PAstV1 and one sample belonged to PAstV2. It kept unknown whether PAstVs could be long-standing in sows or could have been infected from nursery pigs. More paired fecal and serum samples need be investigated to show better insights into whether there is vertical transmission, possible age-restriction and extraintestinal pathogenesis.",

Phylogenetic analysis showed that multiple distinct genotypes of PAstVs were circulating in the pig farms, which would facilitate their genetic recombination and even probably increase the occurrence of interspecies recombination events. Luo et al. indicated that PAstV1 and PAstV3 were closely related to strains found in sheep, mink, cats and humans [33] , but PAstV2 was possibly restricted to pigs. Actually, in our study, PAstV2 was closer to other animal astroviruses, such as those in porcupines, bats, cattle and deer. In particular, there was higher homology (92.8% nt identity) between porcupine astrovirus and PAstV2-XYM14, further suggesting they could share the same ancestral origin, but whether there were past cross-species transimission between porcupine and swine by yet-undentified intermediate hosts required further investigation [30] .",

Previous studies have shown that most of the AstVs strains contain a conserved stemloop II-like motif (s2 m) near the 3\u02ca-UTR [25, 31, 40] which was thought to play an important role in viral life cycle [41] . However, our study found the lack of s2 m in PAstV2 and PAstV4 strains, in agreement with the previous reports [25, 33, 42] , so whether the lack of s2 m will affect the biological function, or whether the virus could compensate by forming stable secondary structures in the different regions of their 3\u02ca-UTR [33] , remains to be confirmed by further studies.",

In particular, the results reveal the existence of all five known lineages in the pig population with a high prevalence of PAstV2, PAstV1 and PAstV5 in animals of different ages and newly described PAstV3 presence in China. Importantly, this study also proved that porcine astroviruses exist in blood with the dominance of PAstV1, adding to the reported genotypes (PAstV2, PAstV4 and PAstV5), which suggested there would be wider presence of different PAstV genotypes in blood, possibly resulting in a more complicate pathogenesis outside the enteric system. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the partial genes and molecular characterization revealed high genetic heterogeneity and more information about 3\u2032 partial genome. The strains of PAstV2 and PAstV3 were close to known astrovirus species from many different animals suggesting different ancestral origins or occurrence of interspecies transmission. More PAstVs whole genome sequences will be needed in order to fully understand the evolution and ecology of the Astroviridae family of viruses.",

Sixty serum samples were collected from each pig farm and these included suckling pigs (n = 20), nursery pigs (n = 10), fully grown pigs (n = 10) and sows (n = 20). The fecal samples were placed into 10 mL centrifuge tubes and diluted with 1 \u00d7 Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 200 U/ml penicillin, 200 mg/ml streptomycin. Samples were homogenized by vortexing for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Viral RNA was extracted from 20% (w/v) fecal supernatants and serum samples using the RNAiso PLUS kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China). 300 \u03bcL of fecal homogenate were prepared for viral extraction and viral RNA was stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until needed.",

To avoid the possible contamination, the fecal samples and serum were processed and detected separately and the double negative controls were set up in RT-PCR. Once we obtained the PAstVpositive samples, which will be double checked. The PCR cycling conditions using the two different sets of primers were as described previously [33] .

The first PCR reaction was performed using the outer specific primer and the 3\u02ca-RACE outer primer (complementary to the outer part of 3\u02ca-RACE adaptor primer) provided in the kit and the reaction was pre-degenerated at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 20 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30s, 58\u00b0C for 30s, 72\u00b0C for 2 min 30s and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The first-round PCR product was used as the template for the second-round PCR reaction which was performed using an inner specific primer and a 3\u02ca-RACE inner primer (complementary to the inner part of 3\u02ca-RACE adaptor primer) provided in the kit. The reaction conditions were the same as the first round PCR except the cycles were increased to 35 cycles. PCR products were purified, cloned and sequenced as described previously [44] .",
