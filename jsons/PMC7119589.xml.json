This virus caused nearly 800 deaths and infected more than 8000 people in various affected countries throughout the world (Stadler et al., 2003). The SARS-coronavirus Spike protein has only 20\u201327% pairwise identity at the amino acid level to the Spike proteins of other previously characterised coronaviruses. Recently, the genomes of SARS-CoV isolates, implicated in the 2003 Toronto outbreak, were sequenced in their entirety (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The production of mAbs to the SARS-CoV virus is critical for diagnostic development, vaccine research and studies of viral pathogenesis. Assays that detect the presence of virally encoded proteins or nucleic acids may be preferable for diagnosis of SARS infections as the development of serum antibodies in infected individuals is quite protracted (Li et al., 2003a).",

The coronaviruses form a single genus of the family Coronaviridae and the virions are large (80\u2013160 nm in diameter) pleomorphic, but generally spherical, particles. Virions of most coronaviruses contain three major proteins: the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N); a small membrane-embedded glycoprotein (M); and a large club-shaped peplomer glycoprotein (S) which appears in EM micrographs as protruding spikes 20 nm in length. The M protein is synthesised on ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. The subcellular localisation of M protein to the Golgi is believed to influence the site of virus budding in the infected cell. The S-protein mediates many of the biological properties of the virus, including attachment to cell receptors, penetration, and cell-fusion, and it is the major target for virus-neutralising antibodies (Collins et al., 1982, Talbot et al., 1984, Wege et al., 1984, Jimenez et al., 1986, Laude et al., 1986, Godet et al., 1994). A portion of the S glycoprotein that is not incorporated into budding virions is transported to the plasma membrane of the cell where it remains bound to the cell surface (Gerna et al., 1982).",

Antigenic similarities between various coronaviruses have been demonstrated to reside in the S-protein and have been used to study the evolution of this virus family (Brian et al., 1983). For most coronaviruses causing enteric and respiratory diseases the pathophysiological events leading to clinical symptoms are due to the acute cytocidal infection of the target cells. These infections can be limited by the local immune response resulting in the production of secretory antibodies specific for the S-protein (Enjuanes et al., 1995). In contrast, many coronaviruses are maintained and spread in the population as inapparent and subclinical infections. The sequence of events leading to chronic versus acute disease is unknown but likely depends on the expression of viral genes, the functional impairment of host cells, and the interaction with the host immune response.",

Recently the SARS S-protein was shown to be a functional fusogen and is about 180\u2013200 kDa in size (Xiao et al., 2003). A host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was recently identified as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, and mediated infection of 293T cells in vitro (Li et al., 2003b). Therefore, antibody responses to the S-protein may neutralise the infectivity of the SARS-CoV. The immunogenetics of antibody responses to protective epitopes is of particular importance and will lead to a clearer understanding of the nature of protective antibody responses to SARS. Lastly, the production of protective monoclonal antibodies may lead to the development of new recombinant therapeutic antibodies in order to provide rapid protection in SARS patients. In the present work, a description of the development of murine mAbs against the SARS-CoV involved in the Toronto SARS outbreak is presented. The mAbs were analysed for pertinent immunochemical properties and for their ability to neutralise SARS-CoV in vitro.\n",

Briefly, 500 ml of supernatant from SARS-CoV infected Vero-6 cells was concentrated first on top of a cushion of iodixanol in a Beckman SW32 rotor (Mississauga, ON). The virus was subsequently mixed to form a suspension of 20% iodixanol and subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman NVT 90 rotor (Mississauga, ON) for 3.5 h at 400,000\u00d7g. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the self-generated gradient, tested by Western immunoblot with SARS-CoV-infected, convalescent human patient serum, and the SARS-CoV positive fractions were pooled and dialysed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

On days 48 and 63, the mice received 5 \u03bcg of the same antigen in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl SC with IFA. The mice received a final booster injection with 5 \u03bcg of highly purified SARS-CoV in 200 \u03bcl PBS to the intra-peritoneal cavity 3 days prior to hybridoma fusion. Mice were euthanised by anaesthesia overdose and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. The spleens were subsequently excised under aseptic conditions.",

Briefly, spleens were harvested 3 days after a final boost with a given antigen and the splenocytes were prepared by splenic perfusion as follows. Under aseptic conditions, the spleens were perforated with a 10 cm3 syringe with a 21 gauge sterile disposable needle. The spleen cells were perfused out of the spleen with injections of serum free BD cell Mab Quantum Yield medium (BD-Pharmingen, Oakville, ON). Two identically immunised mouse spleens were used to produce these hybridoma clones. The fusion was performed using the P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma line in log-phase growth.

The effects of different denaturing treatments on the binding activity of a subset of neutralising and some non-neutralising mAbs were examined using immuno-dotblot assays on infected lysates compared to uninfected lysates. The series of conditions tested include exposure to heat, detergent, a reducing agent, and combinations thereof. Interestingly, mAb F26G15, which binds to the nucleoprotein in Western immunoblot, does not bind to the SARS-CoV antigen in immuno-dotblot under any of the conditions tested. The inherent charge of the highly phosphorylated nucleoprotein, or of the immobilon membrane used in the assays, may provide an explanation for these results. Immuno-dot blots were not performed with mAbs F26G2, F26G4, F26G12, F26G14, or F26G17, however the binding of these mAbs is considered conformational as they do not bind to SARS-CoV proteins in Western immunoblot (Fig. 2). The binding of Spike protein specific mAbs F26G1, F26G18, and F26G19 is inhibited in immuno-dotblot assays when antigens are treated with heat plus detergent, or heat plus detergent plus reducing agent. When the immuno-dotblot assay was instead performed using purified virus particles, the result was identical for nucleoprotein specific mAb F26G15, and Spike specific mAbs F26G1, F26G18, and F26G19 (data not shown). Antigen pre-treatment for Western immunoblot, which depends on the application of an electrical current, differs when compared to passive adsorption in ELISA and Immuno-dotblot assays, and clearly do not always correlate with one another.

Murine antibody responses to inactivated whole SARS-CoV are focused upon the SARS Spike and NP protein as shown by the specificity of the recovered mAbs. While multiple SARS-CoV proteins appear to be the target of mouse serum antibody as shown in Western blot (Fig. 2, immune sera), the majority of the mAbs recognise the Spike protein in Western immunoblot. In a SARS-CoV infection, the host immune system is exposed to a large load of nucleoprotein antigen, due to the presence of replicating virus in infected tissues. This would suggest that a competitive ELISA format based upon the NP as the target antigen might provide increased sensitivity for early detection of infection. Towards this goal, the ability of SARS convalescent serum to compete for binding of mAbs to the nucleoprotein or to Spike on whole SARS-CoV was tested via ELISA. The serum samples were gamma-irrradiated prior to use. Antibodies in the serum of patient S3 clearly inhibit binding of both the nucleoprotein mAb F26G15 and the Spike protein specific mAb F26G6 (Fig. 3\n). In contrast, antibody in pooled normal human sera does not compete for binding by either mAb. While not a statistical analysis these data show that these mAbs are useful for the development of serological competition assays which can be subjected to validation tests. The sera from several other SARS-CoV infected patients demonstrate a similar ability to inhibit binding by the F26G15 (nucleoprotein specific mAb) and F26G6 (spike specific mAb). However, in some samples there is inhibition of only the binding to nucleoprotein without inhibition of the mAb to the Spike protein suggesting that Spike antibody responses take longer to develop in infected humans (data not shown). The predominance of mAbs to the Spike protein in mice immunised with intact viral particles led us to test for biological activity in virus neutralisation assays.",

Irrelevant, isotype matched mAbs, produced in an identical fashion, do not react with SARS-CoV infected Vero cells.",

The method of antigen preparation and quality of the antigen greatly affect the interpretation of mAb binding results obtained from immuno-dotblot assays. Importantly, none of the mAbs react with mock-infected lysates as assayed in Immuno-dotblots (data not shown). This observation suggests that the majority of the neutralising mAbs likely target surface exposed, protein epitopes on the native viral particle. One such putative protective antigen has been identified as the Spike protein by Western immunoblot analysis with neutralising mAbs F26G18 and F26G19.",

While purified virus is clearly the optimal antigen tested in this series of experiments, the lower quality SARS-CoV-infected Vero cell lysates are, however, much easier to prepare for diagnostic assays. Therefore, the limits of mAb binding to SARS-CoV infected Vero cell lysates were further examined via ELISA. The majority of these mAbs exhibit decreased binding when the antigen is heat denatured (Table 2\n). Heat denaturation has very little effect on the binding of non-neutralising mAb F26G16, which also maintains a high level of binding in ELISA using infected Vero cell lysates. F26G16 does, however, show higher background on the irrelevant antigen, BSA, and has inconsistent reactivity in Western immunoblots with heat denatured viral lysate (Fig. 1, Table 1). The combination of lower quality antigen in infected Vero cell lysates, along with heat denaturation of the antigens, has a stronger negative effect on binding by the neutralising mAbs compared to non-neutralising mAbs (Table 2). Indeed, regardless of Western immunoblot reactivity, the non-neutralising clones retain a greater ability to bind heat denatured antigen compared to the neutralising mAbs (lower mean percent reduction in OD per group P<0.001, Student\u2019s t-test, Table 2). This supports the earlier observation in ELISA on purified SARS-CoV (Fig. 1) that shows that the neutralising mAbs have higher requirements for native epitope conformation compared to non-neutralising mAbs.",

The immuno-dotblot is, overall, a less sensitive method, and the results are more difficult to quantify, compared to ELISA. For example, mAb F26G18 binds to the SARS-CoV Spike protein in Western immunoblot and neutralises SARS-CoV infection in vitro. While binding in Western immunoblot generally suggests the epitope is linear in nature, nonetheless, heat treatments clearly affect binding of some mAbs to the whole virion. The immuno-dotblot data reveal that with the lower quality antigen of the infected Vero cell lysate, under the conditions of heat-plus detergent, or heat-plus detergent and reducing agent, mAb F26G18 cannot bind (Table 1).",

These data are consistent with the appearance of coronavirus antigens on the surface of the infected cell during replication (Talbot et al., 1984), although the fixation process may allow for reactivity of these mAbs with internal antigens as well. The conformational sensitivity of most of the SARS-CoV neutralising mAbs is consistent with properties of neutralising mAbs raised against other enveloped viruses, which generally require more native conformation for binding (Wilson et al., 2000, Zwick et al., 2001). The immuno-dotblot assays contradict the classification of several putative epitopes as being linear as is suggested by positive Western immunoblot reaction (for example with neutralising mAb F26G18). Indeed, it appears that the strict traditional classification of epitopes as being linear or conformational must account for a broader spectrum of conformational requirements, especially when dealing with antigens of variable quality in different immunological tests. However, in general the neutralising mAbs can be considered to have a higher requirement for correct epitope conformation compared to non-neutralising mAbs in ELISA. It will be important to verify, under optimised conditions (Opstelten et al., 1995) the use of viral lysates designed for maximal recovery of coronavirus proteins, and to this end the production of high quality recombinant protein antigens will provide useful insights. Unfortunately, preparation of highly purified viral antigen requires enormous efforts under bio-containment conditions, which emphasises the need for a quality recombinant antigen assay. Collectively, these data demonstrate that development of mAb-based diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV infection is well within reach.",

Epitopes on the Spike protein provide neutralising targets on SARS-CoV in vitro, and this is consistent with the Spike being the target of neutralising antibodies for other coronavirus strains (Godet et al., 1994). Moreover, these mAbs may be useful for the identification of protective epitopes for vaccine formulations (Enjuanes et al., 1995). Studies are underway to determine the identity of the antigen(s) recognised by the neutralising, Western immunnoblot negative mAbs. Preliminary analysis of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the cloned VH and VL coding regions of these mAbs suggests that the mAbs are distinct. This observation implies that the hybridoma clones expressing the anti-SARS-CoV neutralising mAbs were derived from individually rearranged and clonally selected B cells in vivo. It also reveals that there is no apparent consensus sequence within the complementarity determining regions that is required for the mAbs to exhibit virus neutralisation activity. This finding makes it feasible to engineer multiple mAbs with high specificity and avidity for various SARS-CoV epitopes for preparations of defined cocktails of therapeutic mAbs. A detailed description of the immunogenetic properties of these mAbs is in preparation (Berry et al., manuscript in preparation). The NP specific mAb, F26G15, is useful in competitive ELISA with patient sera. This is important as early detection of SARS infections is key to risk management of this disease. This is the first description of neutralising mAbs from a host immunised with whole SARS-CoV and these antibodies should prove useful for the development of new diagnostic tests, studies of antigenic variation, and vaccine development in the global fight against SARS.",
