DOTAP and DOTMA have been used previously as cationic lipid components of cationic liposomes or nanoparticles for siRNA delivery. For example, DOTAP-modified cationic poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide acid) nanoparticles have been used in an inhalable dry powder formulation of siRNA,13 and DOTAP-based cationic liposomes have been reported as a system for delivering siRNA to lung cancer cells.14 DOTMA-based cationic liposomes have been used to increase the cellular delivery of siRNA to human airway epithelial cells, and mouse neuroblastoma cells in vitro.15 Compared with DOTAP and DOTMA, EDOPC is a relatively new cationic lipid, and is less studied as a carrier of nucleic acid therapeutics. Although it has been studied for transfection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with plasmid DNA,16 and in vivo systemic delivery of plasmid DNA in mice,17 there are still few reports on the application of EDOPC-based nanoparticles for the delivery of siRNA.",

Among the nanolipoplexes prepared in this study, siGL2/ECL nanolipoplexes had the least effect on cell viability, followed by siGL2/DTCL and siGL2/EDL nanolipoplexes.
