            "text": "This contribution explores the thesis that Epidemiology should be considered as Ecosystem Science; it does this through an examination of the following sub-themes.Biomedicine exhibits two paradigms of explaining disease. The monogenic conception of disease, which is the dominant paradigm, embodies the standards and criteria of scientificity for Biomedicine. In contrast, Epidemiology is considered to be the Cinderella as its paradigm of explanation and scientificity is different and hence, held, at arm\u2019s length, if not with outright suspicion.1The two paradigms differ ontologically and methodologically. The monogenic conception of disease upholds the thesis: one causal agent, one disease entity. It rests on thing-ontology. Its implied model of causality is Humean, monofactorial and linear (the causal arrow is unidirectional, from cause to effect only). On the other hand, Epidemiology understands disease not so much as a disease entity but more as a pattern of interrelated events which may lead to a pattern of ill-health in the population. It rests on process-ontology. Its model of causality is non-Humean, multi-factorial and non-linear (the relationships are synergistic, reciprocal, with feedback loops).2While the monogenic conception of disease is rooted in the Gold Standard of the Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and of late its related Gold Standard of Evidence-based Medicine (EBM), Epidemiology proceeds more in the manner of Ecology as a field science. Ecology explicitly studies ecosystems: the biotic and abiotic components which make up a particular ecosystem, the relationships between these with the ecosystem as a Whole, not to mention with other ecosystems. This kind of science is necessarily non-Reductionist as the Whole in terms of its causal inter- as well as intra-relationships are reciprocal in character; this complicated network of causal relations means that properties emerge from the Whole which cannot be predicted by simply adding up the contribution of each of the component parts of the Whole. Epidemiology is, hence, Ecosystem Science.3 It will also be shown that Ecosystem Science/Thinking itself may be considered as a variant of Systems Thinking.If one cares to do some comparative history of science, the model of Ecosystem Science/Thinking and Systems Theory/Thinking can be said to be found in Classical Chinese Medicine (CCM for short, whose origin may be traced back to more than two and a half thousand or more years): CCM is a science which is Wholist4 in orientation, resting on process-ontology (rather than thing-ontology) and whose causal model is multi-factorial, non-linear and reciprocal, and with feedback loops.5In a very brief extension of the theme at 4, this contribution looks at how CCM perceived/perceives epidemics and whether it had/has any grasp of what today we call Epidemiology. The conclusion is positive, although to mark the differences in spite of the similarities between CCM and modern Epidemiological thinking, the CCM discipline will occur in italicised form, namely, Epidemiology.",

Their research ushered in not simply the Age of Bacteriology but the era of \u201ctruly scientific medicine\u201d. Pasteur is commonly acknowledged to be the father of the germ theory of disease which covers not merely harmful bacteria but also viruses. Koch was famous for his discovery of the tubercle bacillus as the cause of tuberculosis. Furthermore, he is associated with four methodological postulates which constitute the so-called Gold Standard for determining etiologically defined diseases in terms of infectious agents.6 Within two decades (1891\u20131899), germs were also found for cholera, diphtheria, typhoid, tetanus, plague, and rabies. This impressive array of discoveries put paid to previous theories of disease such as the miasma and the humour theories. The rise of the science of bacteriology also more or less coincided with the emergence of new therapeutic treatments, displacing traditional ones, such as venesection, generally recognised to be inefficacious. Pasteur developed a vaccine against rabies; Paul Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata demonstrated that Salvarsan, an arsenical compound, could kill the spirochete of syphilis without drastic side effects, such as killing the patient. To be fair, one must point out that Koch\u2019s vaccine against tuberculosis, tuberculin was a failure; an effective treatment did not appear until 1946 with the arrival of streptomycin. This, itself, heralded even the more impressive age of the antibiotic: Fleming had by chance discovered penicillin as early as 1928 but the mass manufacture of antibiotics was made possible through the efforts of Florey and Chain during the Second World War. As a result, antibiotics did not make a dramatic appearance until after the war.7",

            "text": "Koch also forcefully articulated the monogenic conception of disease in 1901. It suffices here to comment on only three aspects:Koch said: \u201cdiseases are best controlled and understood by means of causes, in particular, by causes that are natural\u2026\u201d. At a stroke it destroyed the very old religious view that the cause of diseases was an expression of divine displeasure as well as its therapy in terms of prayer/miracle. Simultaneously, it also overturned the Hippocratic/Galenic account in terms of \u201cfluid\u201d medicine. \u201cSolid\u201d medicine became the new paradigm in medical thinking. A new research programme came into existence, a programme which after more than a 100 years is still regarded as \u201cprogressive\u201d in spite of growing numbers of serious anomalies it has produced in its wake.He said: \u201ceach disease is caused by one particular microbe\u2014and by one alone. Only an anthrax microbe causes anthrax; only a typhoid microbe can cause typhoid fever\u201d.8 One commentator has put it: \u201cthe final hope and aim of medical science is the establishment of monogenic disease entities (Taylor 1979, p. 21)\u201d.Koch strengthened the above by setting out his guidelines or methodological rules for ascertaining the cause which are sometimes called the Koch\u2013Henle postulates:The bacteria must be present in every case of the disease.The bacteria must be isolated from the host with the disease and grown in pure culture.The specific disease must be reproduced when a pure culture of the bacteria is inoculated into a healthy susceptible host.The bacteria must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host.",

This implies a notion of cause which is monofactorial and linear. This causal paradigm was simply borrowed from other successful Newtonian sciences such as physics and chemistry. It is said to be Humean which is also presented as the Billiard-ball account. This image is apt as it brings out certain features which are pertinent to the context of Biomedicine. The infectious-agent conception of disease as earlier remarked is \u201csolid\u201d medicine; the cause can be a bacterium/virus/fungus/poison. The cause, just like a billiard ball, is a solid object which can be seen (under specialised instruments such as the electron microscope, PET or TOM), collected and measured/quantified, or removed, and cultivated elsewhere outside the human body. Billiard balls left to themselves would not move without the introduction of an external force, that applied initially by the player via the billiard cue hitting the first billiard ball; analogously, the infectious agent is an external pathogen which invades the human body setting off a series of motions within.10",

            "text": "Although RCT and EBM constitute the Gold Standards of scientificity in Biomedicine as already observed, the former is not above challenge as it relies on randomisation to eliminate bias from its experimental set-up.11 This requires the trial to have primarily two arms, the experimental and the control. The former is given the treatment but not the latter. Should the difference in outcome between the two arms be positive (and also pass the test of being statistically significant), then this is attributed to the efficacy of the treatment. This conclusion appears to be methodologically sound only because the experimental set-up appears to conform to Mill\u2019s experimental logic, that of the method of difference.12 RCT, relying, in the main, methodologically on the technique of randomisation amounts to presupposing the axiom which may be called the axiom of homogeneity. However, this axiom, in reality, fails to obtain except by resorting to the device of deeming participants/patients to be homogenous, save in one respect only. As a matter of fact, patients are heterogenous, not homogenous as a group. As a result, the RCT-EBM-approved-\u201cefficacious\u201d treatment may turn out to be irrelevant to their concern. Individual patients are not artefacts which can be ordered from a factory to conform uniformly to a very specific set of common characteristics. Randomisation as the key methodological/analytical technique can undoubtedly take care of allocation bias, but not other sorts of bias, such as selection bias. RCT\u2019s inability to eliminate the latter type of bias renders its results at best statistically relevant and at worst clinically irrelevant. While hospital management in general and organisations such as NICE (in the UK) are interested in statistical relevance in respect of a drug\u2019s efficacy, the \u201cfield\u201d doctor who is concerned with individual patient care is interested in clinical relevance: a drug which passes the test of statistical relevance (via RCT-EBM) may be of no help to the doctor-and-her-patient, whereas a drug which has failed to pass such a test may be of help to the individual doctor-and-her-patient (given the patient\u2019s own specificities of a medical-physical-psychological-social-moral kind known to the doctor who is in charge of her health).13 The axiom of homogeneity suffers from severe methodological limitations.",

However, one should not misunderstand this to mean that successful epidemiological research would have no impact on individual lives as it clearly can and does\u2014for instance, once the handle of the pump in Broad Street was removed, the death rate fell dramatically.

The latter is a mere collection of its parts; its parts function independently of one another; hence the arrangement of its components as well as overall structure is irrelevant, as its behaviour depends merely on its size.

Admittedly each of the following interventions produces some effect, each in its own right: smoking cessation programs, prohibiting smoking in public spaces, increasing cigarette taxes, social marketing and so on. However, the Epidemiologist in accordance with Systems Thinking would also consider what would happen when all the relevant interventions are combined; the total joint effect might be greater than the sum of their effects when produced in isolation from one another (synergistic effects). In a system, when changes in a factor/variable provide feedback into the process, generating feedback loops which may produce positive or negative impacts. Suppose high taxes on cigarettes would reduce the number of smokers. The next step to pursue is to see if higher taxation would lead to changes over time in social attitudes to smoking which may then make it possible to increase enforcement of public smoking regulations. If it does, then this would be a positive feedback impact. On the other hand, raising cigarette taxes would mean the treasury has less money to render smoking cessation programs accessible to help individuals to quit the habit. This then would lead to a negative feedback impact.",

An ecological community may be defined (albeit simplistically) in terms of a group of actually or potentially interacting species of organisms living in the same place\u2014one well known type of possible interaction is of course the prey-predator relationship, another is mutualism. A population in ecological literature refers to a group of individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area\u2014for instance, the Arctic supports a population of polar bears. Ecology concentrates on population rather than on the individual organism in a population; one reason amongst others is that scientists/society have neither the economic nor technological resources to study individual organisms, even very large ones, like large mammals such as polar bears. Furthermore, their primary focus is on characteristics of population: distribution (the area in which the population exists); abundance or size of the population; its rates of growth, birth and death; spacing and dispersion, emigration and immigration (as animals are mobile, seeds of plants can spread via wind, water, mobile animals), predator\u2013prey relationship; disease which can affect population growth either directly by killing off the young before they can even reach reproductive age or by affecting the reproductively mature animal through undermining their health and, thereby, their reproductive performance.23",

The notion of an ecosystem may be spelt out in some detail as follows:Ecosystems do not come labelled as such; scientific investigators have to identify and delimit them for the purpose of their study at hand. However, this does not mean, that they are abstract theoretical entities with no bearing to reality on the ground. Some have clearly identifiable boundaries (such as a meadow, an estuary), others are not so obviously the case. Some can be very big, such as Antarctica or the Arctic, others infinitesimally small in comparison, such as a handful of soil.Any ecosystem, such as that of Yellowstone Park or the Gobi Desert, occupies a certain portion of time and space which has a historical dimension both in terms of time and space. For instance, neither Yellowstone nor the Gobi had existed from time immemorial, nor historically would the space they each commanded be necessarily identical to that they each now respectively occupy. It is sometimes possible, though not frequently, to ascertain the precise beginning of an ecosystem, such as the sudden throwing up of a small island in the middle of an ocean as a result of an undersea volcanic eruption.An ecosystem evolves, changing all the time\u2014at time t1, a particular item predominates, at time t2, that item may have retreated somewhat, its predominant position taken over by another item. For instance, in a shoreline ecosystem at t1, large cliffs stand out, but at t2, some of the cliffs might have collapsed into the sea below, generating a new landscape with changes for the ecosystem involved, even to the extent of perhaps creating two related but different ecosystems.Overtime, one ecosystem may evolve into a distinctively different ecosystem. For instance, take a lake. Of all the geological formations, lakes are said to be the most ephemeral as they evolve and change the quickest. A lake would shrink (for a variety of reasons, climate change, either of a local or global kind, another could be excessive extraction of water from it by humans), and would dry out completely, eventually evolving to become a meadow. Inland seas too shrink such as the ongoing shrinkage of the Aral Sea.",

It cannot violate the laws of thermodynamics.7.Every ecosystem must be grasped as a Whole; an ecosystem Whole cannot be understood in a reductionist manner. In other words, this Whole has properties which are over and above, not simply the sum of the properties of all the constituent parts. Let us briefly look at this implication of Ecosystem Wholism by considering a handful of soil. The soil consists of both biotic (usually micro-organisms but also macro-organisms such as worms which are visible to the naked eye) as well as abiotic elements, such as water, air, chemicals (PH content, etc.). The character of the soil (such as its texture) cannot be accounted for solely in terms of the properties of each of its constituent components\u2014it may be said, therefore, to be an emergent property of the Whole system, born of the complex interplay between all the variables involved in that handful of soil and the micro-climate of which it is a part.",

Imagine the population of foxes increasing in a particular habitat. Foxes prey on rabbits. Increase of foxes would mean decrease of rabbits, but as rabbits are eaten up by foxes, the predator would suffer from a shortage of prey. As a result, the fox population would decline; the rabbit population would instead increase. As a result, equilibrium is restored between predator and prey, equivalent to a negative feedback loop. It is seen to be at work in regulating populations in ecology. An ecosystem would be de-stabilised if its populations (whether between animals and animals, plants and animals, plants and plants) exceed its carrying capacity.10.An ecosystem also exhibits positive feedback loops which are responsible for the sudden appearance of rapid changes. Positive feedback involves a circular set of effects which are self-reinforcing. For instance, an ecosystem primarily of grasses with few shrubs may be stable for five to ten or more years. Yet such an ecosystem may change over time and the change would occur within a relatively short period of time. Shrubs which started off by being few and far between amongst the grasses, take a much longer time than grasses to establish themselves in the ecosystem, as their roots go deeper and initially competed unfavourably for rain water with grasses, whose roots are in the topsoil. Hence the ecosystem remains basically a grass ecosystem. However, over time, the shrubs, having established themselves, albeit slowly, would begin to grow taller, overshadowing the grass. Then seemingly suddenly, the grasses would be at a disadvantage in the competition for sunlight, fade and not flourish as well as they have done in the past. The grass ecosystem would have then turned itself into a shrub ecosystem. As established shrubs are more successful in capturing the available water and sunlight than the grasses, these will decrease dramatically. Positive feedback loops act as forces of change and are a source of instability.",

Things are the objects of study by Newtonian Science; these are macroscopic objects, with definite boundaries, varying in actual size from a planet/heavenly body to microbes and atoms. Things/macro-sized objects possess the following characteristics: they are visible (if not to the naked eye, then with the help of instruments), touchable, impenetrable, have form, shape and size, and are measurable.

The doctrine takes a position within the spectrum of competing following contentions:Process has primacy over things. Substance is subordinate to process: Things are simply constellations of processes.Process has priority over substance. Things are always subordinate to processes because processes inwardly engender, determine, and characterize the things there are. But processes as such transcend the realm of things since there are also substance-detached processes.Substance has priority over process. The only sort of processes\u2026are (sic) those involved in the doings and comportment of things.Substance has primacy over process. Indeed, substance is all there is; all processes and changes are simply a matter of how things appear to certain (mind-equipped) substances.The first two of these competing contentions represent process philosophy respectively in its stronger (Heraclitean) and weaker (Empedoclean) versions.

To illustrate this point in greater detail, take Ecosystem 3: it is about the relationship between the yin organ and the yang organ, such that each visceral organ-system/Zangfu/\u810f\u8151 has a yin as well as a yang component.

Earth stands for a period when yinqi and yangqi are in equilibrium. Earth engenders Metal (in the sense that Earth harbours both the biotic and the abiotic, including metals in its bowels). Metal stands for Autumn (when yangqi begins its retreat as yinqi rises, and as the ancient Chinese noticed that when the Moon was full, the tide was high, and they were particularly impressed by the high tide at the time of the full moon during the eighth lunar month of their calendar, which marks the beginning of Autumn).

Heavy rains could cause floods; to prevent flooding, one could use earth to build dykes and dams\u2014in this sense, the ancient Chinese postulated that Earth constrains Water. To prevent a fire from spreading, one would need water to damp down the fire\u2014in this sense, it could be said that Water constrains Fire.

A normal relationship means that in Winter, yinqi is at its maximum and yangqi is at its minimum, and that in Summer, the reverse relationship obtains. However, illness occurs when the relationship is not normal for the time of year in the individual person as ascertained by feeling the mai (normally translated as pulse but which this author thinks should be resisted). But in this context, let us understand Wuxing not so much in CCM but in general in the context of applying it to explain ecological phenomena. Abnormal relationships between yangqi and yinqi are mediated by two sub-concepts called Deficiency (buzu) and Excess (taiguo). We see these concepts at work clearly in the Mutually Constraining as well as the Mutually Engendering modes. Look at Fig. 4 again and, in particular, at Fire constraining Metal. When Fire is in excess, this means that Metal would be over-constrained by Fire; such over-constraining would provoke Metal to \u201cfight back\u201d not, however, directly against Fire, but against Water instead, as Metal engenders Water. One could then say that Fire has, ultimately, \u201cmet its own come-uppance\u201d or achieved an \u201cown goal\u201d, as Water constrains Fire. Let us call this Example A.",

In the Engendering cycle, we know that Fire engenders Earth; but here Fire itself has been weakened and its weakened state would in turn impact upon its process of engendering Earth.

When excessive tree cutting occurs, Wood would be adversely affected (with fewer trees left standing). Wood constrains Earth; with fewer trees around, Wood\u2019s ability to constrain Earth would result in Deficiency (in other words, soil loss/erosion would increase). Earth constrains Water, but with soil loss/erosion, Earth can no longer perform adequately the role of holding back water, owing to its qi Deficiency.

Zhang Zhongjing probably completed his book, the Shanghanzabinglun/\u300a\u4f24\u5bd2\u6742\u75c5\u8bba\u300b/Discourse on Cold Damage and Other Illnesses, a few years after 200 CE.35 During his lifetime, Sima Qian in the Historical Records/Shiji mentioned 22 natural disasters\u2014drought, floods, landslides, earth-quakes, locusts, famines, dykes bursting. It also coincided with a long period of unrest, with continuous wars, including those before the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013265 CE) as well as those occurring during it. This meant that the economy suffered, production went down. The conjuncture of natural disasters, economic chaos and war would inevitably lead to all sorts of unimaginable social ills. People were driven from the land, and therefore, into poverty, hunger, illnesses, and even cannibalism, with death and corpses everywhere throughout China\u2019s heartland. Under such circumstances, epidemics naturally flourished. Zhang Zhongjing wrote, in the Preface to his book, that of his own extended family/clan which included more than 200 people, two-thirds had died; 70% of those, who perished, had died from the epidemic raging then from 196 CE. Historians have calculated that roughly half of the Chinese population could have perished in total. As a result, Zhang Zhongjing was not only determined to help relieve suffering but also seize the opportunity to study the epidemic, to collect as much information as he could, including the prescriptions which were used by physicians at large to handle effectively some of the cases involved.36",

The quick way to quell this doubt has already been just given, namely, that as CCM suffered/suffers no rupture of any kind, it follows that it embodied/embodies Ecosystem Thinking and such Ecosystem Thinking would cover all domains of its theory and practice. In other words, this means that in treating the phenomenon called epidemics, CCM would have used that very framework which Epidemiology today (this paper argues) deploys. This, in turn, would mean that CCM would have grasped the concept of epidemiology whether one deigns to use the term \u201cepidemiology\u201d or not; but as is the wont of this author, the term would be used but italicised, namely, it would appear as Epidemiology to mark both the similarities as well as the differences between them.

The preparation for the burial of those who had died from it and the presence of corpses which no one in the larger family or even clan could bury as families and clans themselves were dead or dying, was a task left to the state. The first record of such intervention occurred during the pre Qin\u2013Han period\u2014in the Zhouli/\u300a\u5468\u793c\u300b,37 the abandoned dead were interred by state authorities. After this, the strategy became standard procedure during epidemics, with the state buying the coffins and carrying out the whole process of preparing the body for internment. By Song times, the state had resorted to getting Buddhist monks to carry out this task, and rewarded those who performed it with a special licence to preach their religion. In 1208 CE, the Song state instituted another policy: to encourage volunteers to bury the dead; anyone who buried two hundred abandoned bodies (who were mainly amongst the poor in society) would be given a reward (presumably financial). Furthermore, from the Northern Song onwards, the government also set up designated public sites where the poor could bury their dead and abandoned bodies could be interred. This policy greatly curtailed the spread of an epidemic.",

            "text": "The two strategies set out briefly above are especially relevant to any attempt to throw light on the understanding of the nature of epidemics on the part of the ancient Chinese physicians and on whether they had any grasp at all of what we call Epidemiology today for the following reasons:An epidemic in the medical context is commonly defined in dictionaries as: A widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time (see Oxford English Dictionary). The ancient Chinese use of dayi or jiyi satisfies this dictionary sense in English.The ancient Chinese physicians (and the imperial officials) implicitly recognised that an epidemic could involve an illness which was infectious but which could also be an illness called contagious in today\u2019s medical language; hence to stop the spread of the epidemic, they realised that one must dispose of the victims properly.While the ancient Chinese physicians did not abandon, as we have seen above, the use of medicinals to help individual victims, nevertheless, they realised that the best strategy was isolation, hence quarantine.Contagious illnesses necessarily involved/involve a community, a population. In other words, the best strategy, namely 3 above really implied/implies that CCM had an implicit grasp of the concept of epidemiology as their strategies appear to be concerned with \u201cthe distribution and determinants of disease\u201d.The ancient Chinese physicians were aware of the determinants of illness in an epidemic because: (a) they had observed that not only the features already mentioned above were relevant, but that since very early times, they knew that an external pathogenic factor was involved. In the late Shang dynasty (1600\u20131046 BCE), the Oracle Bone script referred to chong/\u866b, gu/\u86ca, n\u00fce\u00b7ji/\u759f\u75be39 as some of the possible causes of illnesses which if not contagious would have been infectious; (b) CCM was/is very clear that adverse factors internal to the person\u2019s constitution together with adverse factors in the external environment, such as droughts, floods, unseasonal heat/cold, earthquakes, sudden environmental changes including wars which disrupted/disrupt production leading to famine and hunger played/play key role in the emergence of illnesses afflicting large swathes of the population. All these variables acting together (between a and b) could bring about an epidemic, as their mode of thinking, this paper has argued, was/is Ecosystem Thinking.As CCM is Ecosystem Science, it was/is well aware that any human population must live within bigger ecosystems which include the greater natural environment, that is, Ecosystems 6, 7, 9 and 10 set out in Fig. 3 are all involved.For the reasons set out briefly above, it may be appropriate to say that CCM had/has some grasp of the concept of epidemiology, even though its version might not be identical with modern Epidemiology. Hence it might be appropriate to refer to it as Chinese Epidemiology.Apart from the two looked at above, a third relevant strategy needs some brief consideration. This pertains to that of containing the devastating effects of smallpox/tianhua/\u5929\u82b1, which had evolved and developed from the long-held CCM idea of using toxin to fight toxin. Its first successful use was recorded in 1653. This may be cited as evidence for Epidemiological thinking in CCM. The strategy consists of infecting persons with a mild form of smallpox which would not kill them but instead render them immune to the illness in all its normal ferocities. CCM talked about cultivating different types of attenuated smallpox (such as shuimiao/\u6c34\u82d7, hanmaio/\u65f1\u82d7) for the purpose. Following news of success, the Japanese and the Russians introduced the strategy into their countries. The Turks also came to know about the new treatment of inoculation/variolation as Lady Mary Montague, wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Court in Istanbul learnt about it and in 1717, she successfully used it on her own children. When she returned to Britain in 1721, she introduced the idea/technique to the Royal College of Physicians who naturally rejected it; but she persuaded Princess Caroline to test it. Small scale trials were carried out, in one case involving seven death-row convicts at Newgate prison who were offered reprieve provided they agreed to take part in the trial which they did and all survived. However, later trials showed that one in eight of the treated died of the very disease they were being protected against; this still, however, compared favourably with the going rate of about 30 percent of the disease\u2019s untreated victims. This paved the way for Jenner (1749\u20131823)\u2019s vaccination technique. The point here is not to trace the historic link between the Chinese and the Western attempts at immunology, but simply to say that the former\u2019s attempt implied/implies a grasp on the part of CCM physicians that a contagious illness such as smallpox could in principle be contained.40 Vaccination today is a recognised tool in Epidemiology.So far the discussion has only touched on Chinese Epidemiology which covered/covers41 infectious/contagious illnesses. However, Epidemiology today is much less concerned with contagious disease-entities, at least in First World economies (since the introduction of antibiotics at the end of the WWII) than with diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure, heart problems, etc. The \u201cdistribution and determinants\u201d of such diseases are, on the whole, said by Epidemiology to be caused by inappropriate/unhealthy diets/lifestyle, and that the way forward must be to wean people away from such unwholesome to more wholesome ways of living. Did the ancient Chinese physicians have a grasp of such issues? The short answer is yes, via their general concept of Preventive Medicine which encompasses the more specific concepts of yangsheng/\u517b\u751f or yangshen/\u517b\u8eaband of shiyang/\u98df\u517b. The former refers to how to live, nurture, nourish yourself both physically and spiritually in order to lead a long and healthy life; the latter, how to eat properly in order to maintain a long and healthy life. (For details, see Lee 2018, Chapter 4: Preventive Medicine (Primary Meaning) in the Context of CCM as Ecosystem Thinking; Chapter 8: Fang and Food.) In other words, Epidemiology and Epidemiology share this same basic goal and roughly the same way forward in achieving that goal.",

Although Biomedicine has an impressive list of achievements to its name, and remains a still progressive research programme, nevertheless, it has run into anomalies. Furthermore, it is a case of doing science within the Newtonian framework of thing-ontology and whose model of causality is Humean, monofactorial and linear (the Billiard-ball model).In contrast, Epidemiology is perceived to lack the \u201ckudos\u201d of the monogenic conception, as it departs from the paradigm of scientificity of its senior partner. For instance, RCT is irrelevant to its methodology. It focuses on disease population patterns rather than on disease-bearing individuals who succumb to diseases. It rests on process-ontology (events/processes); the enhanced/sophisticated versions of its causal model are multi-factorial, non-linear (with feedback loops), reciprocal and synergistic. Instead of relying on drugs or surgery as treatment, Epidemiology relies on public health measures such as ensuring water and air sanitation, discouraging certain lifestyle habits (such as smoking or consuming too much sugar).Ecology is Ecosystem Science/Thinking and is a variant of Systems Theory/Thinking whose philosophical framework Epidemiology Thinking appears to share both in terms of ontology and the model of causality which its Wholist orientation implies. Ecology, too, studies populations rather than individual organisms. They may all be regarded as post- or non-Newtonian sciences.Although all three (Systems Thinking, Ecology and Epidemiology) are pioneering non-Newtonian sciences (beginning in the twentieth century), in the long dur\u00e9e of human civilisation, their philosophical presuppositions when made explicit can be said to have a history of at least two and a half thousand years. This is for two reasons: (a) CCM is an instantiation of ancient Chinese Science and it has an uninterrupted history of at least two and a half thousand years; (b) CCM, too, rests on process-ontology, and instantiates a causal model which is multi-factorial, non-linear and reciprocal. At all levels of theory-and-practice, of organisation and analysis, it is Wholist in orientation and is fiercely non-Reductionist in its methodology.",

            "text": "However, this should not be taken to mean that Chinese Science and CCM as well as Chinese philosophy underpinning them do not differ from post-Newtonian sciences such as Ecology/Ecosystem Science, Systems Theory/Thinking and Epidemiology in several other ways. It might not be out of place to remind readers yet again of such differences which undoubtedly exist, although not emphasised here; to mark them, terms such as \u201cWholism/Wholist\u201d, \u201cScience\u201d, \u201cMedicine\u201d, \u201cEpidemiology\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d are italicised when used in the Chinese context.5.Based on the above comments and arguments, this contribution feels justified to come to its main conclusion that Epidemiology (today) could be considered as Ecosystem Science/Ecosystem Thinking, and hence, of Systems Theory/Systems Thinking.6.Furthermore, based on the historical evidence found in Chinese history in general and CCM canonical texts in particular, one may plausibly conclude that CCM down the ages had/have an understanding of epidemics and a grasp of some of the key concepts of epidemiology. However, similarities apart, there are obvious differences between the ancient Chinese understanding, on the one hand and modern understanding on the other. To mark both the similarities as well as the differences, it seems fitting to cast the CCM version in italicised form as Epidemiology and to refer to the modern form as Epidemiology.",
