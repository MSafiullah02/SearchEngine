It is caused by mumps virus, which belongs to paramyxovirus family and is transmitted by direct contact, droplet spread, or contaminated fomites. The incubation period of mumps is about 15 to 24 days, with 19 days as median (Richardson et al., 2001). Most mumps infections are mild and self-limiting, while some complications of infections are severe. The most concerned complications are meningitis and encephalitis, arising in 1\u201310% and 0.1% of mumps infections respectively. The mumps infection is also an important cause of sensorineural hearing loss (Tyor and Harrison, 2014).",

The incidences of mumps decreased in many countries at the beginning of 21st century, benefiting from the massive implementation of mumps immunization programs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007, Peltola et al., 2000, Slater et al., 1999). However, there has been a global resurgence of mumps over the last decade, despite high vaccination coverage. Outbreaks have been noticed in many countries, including the United States (2006, 2016) (Barskey et al., 2009, Majumder et al., 2017), Ireland (2008) (Whyte et al., 2009) and the Republic of Korea (2013\u20132015) (Choe et al., 2017). The most vulnerable populations of recent outbreaks were teenagers and young adults, rather than children. The reasons for the recent outbreaks could be due to waning immunity after vaccination (Park et al., 2007, Rubin et al., 2012).",

The immunization coverage rate differs in provinces and the seropositive rate is about 80%\u201390% in children (He et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014). However, as WHO recommended, one dose of MMR may not fully control the epidemic of mumps and two doses of the vaccine are required for long-term protection (WHO, 2007). In China, vaccination rate of the second dose is much lower than that of the first and it may lead to the mumps epidemic during 2011\u20132012, with the incidence rates of 33.9/100,000 and 35.6/100,000 in total population(Su et al., 2016).

However, the seasonal distribution varies between northern and southern China, with the peaks in spring and summer respectively (Li et al., 2017b, Liu et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2014a). Such distributions indicate that meteorological factors may impact on the transmission of mumps. Although there have been some laboratory investigations exploring the effects of meteorological factors on viral diseases (Lowen et al., 2007, Walker and Ko, 2007), such as MERS-CoV (van Doremalen et al., 2013), the respiratory disease transmission in real world is more complex than laboratory environment. It is therefore necessary to explore the effects of meteorological factors in population.",

DLNM is based on the definition of cross-basis, a bi-dimensional function expressed by the combination of two basis functions, which depicts the effects of predictor and lags simultaneously (Gasparrini et al., 2010). Given the possible multicollinearity between eight meteorological factors, the model would be unstable if it included all the meteorological factors. We therefore established a model for each meteorological factor separately and only included the factors, of which Spearman's correlation coefficients with main factor were less than 0.5, as confounders. We added quasi-Poisson generalized additive models to DLNMs to deal with the over-dispersion of daily number of mumps cases. The structure of DLNM is as follows:LogE(Yt]=a+cbMlag+ScbXilag+NSTime+dDow+gHolidaywhere E(Y\nt) denotes the expected number of mumps cases, cb (M, lag) denotes the cross-basis function for the mainly studied meteorological factor, cb (X\ni, lag) denotes the cross-basis function for each confounding meteorological factor, NS (Time) denotes natural cubic spline function to control long-time trend and seasonality, Dow denotes the categorical variable for the day of week, Holiday denotes the binomial variable for public holidays.",

We principally used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to determine degrees of freedom (DF) of natural cubic spline functions. In the final model, long-time trend and seasonality were controlled by the natural cubic spline function with 7DF/year. Degrees of freedom for meteorological factors and their corresponding lags are as follows: 3, 5 for precipitation; 5, 5 for atmospheric pressure; 3, 4 for wind velocity; 6, 5 for temperature; 4, 5 for diurnal temperature range; 3, 6 for relative humidity; 3, 2 for sunshine duration.

            "text": "The effects of meteorological factors may last several days as indicated in the DLNM analyses of this study. This may be related to the incubation of the disease, which is about 15 to 24 days (Richardson et al., 2001). When the individual exposures to an n unfavorable weather condition, the risk of being attacked by mumps virus increase, but the individual may develop into disease after a few day because of the incubation of the disease. It is noteworthy that sunshine duration can affect the incidence of mumps on the specific lag day, but there are not statistically significant cumulative effects within 30 lag days. Meanwhile, although other meteorological factors have statistically significant cumulative effects within 30 lag days, their separate effects along lag days are fluctuating, even turn into protective factors from risk factors in some days. These phenomena can be observed in many studies, especially those used the DLNMs (Limper et al., 2016, van Gaalen et al., 2017). They can be explained by \u201cshort-term displacement\u201d or \u201charvesting effect\u201d, which means that a raised risk ratio at short lags is followed by an apparently protective effect at longer lags (Bhaskaran et al., 2013). Vulnerable population has an earlier onset of mumps than usual time when adverse weather condition occurs, and vulnerable population decreases in the following days so that the incidence decreases.",

For precipitation, the highest level of variable value has the maximum separate effect and cumulative effect on mumps. During study period, the average daily precipitation in May and July was 9.28 mm and comparatively higher than other months (3.59 mm). These also applied to atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. Low level of atmospheric and high level of relative humidity can increase the risk of mumps. These two factors are much lower or higher in high epidemic months than other months (978.46 hPa vs 985.46 hPa, 80.82% vs 75.65%), indicating the seasonable distribution of the disease could be due to the weather pattern.",

Secondly, both separated and cumulated effects were examined, with considering the lagged effect. Thirdly, the non-liner effects were identified, with both low and high end values for each meteorological variable were examined. Fourthly, the most vulnerable sub-populations were identified.

Thirdly, the information of meteorology for analysis is the arithmetic average level of Fujian Province, instead of spatial average of meteorological variables.
