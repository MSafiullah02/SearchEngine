The borrowing effect or \"shrinkage\" tempers those sub-populations which have relatively less data but otherwise allows the data to speak for itself. GLMM provides an optimal compromise between complete pooling and no pooling of the sub-populations in a regression analysis. In that sense GLMM is a precursor to Bayesian approaches which permit greater flexibility through priors and hyper-priors and afford more control over shrinkage effects. Using [19, 20] , we build separate GLMMs for the empirical count observation process across the study locations, for the test type false positive rates, and for the test type false negative rates. In total, we have three GLMMs. We then build Monte Carlo prediction samples [21] for the means of each GLMM and compute the implied prevalence. The GLMM specification is:",

Thus, there is a natural trade-off between investing in tests of high quality, the human resources required to generate large sample sizes, and the speed at which society needs results. The societal and economic consequences between Type I and Type II errors are not equal.",
