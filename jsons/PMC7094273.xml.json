Aliquots (1 ml) were frozen at \u221286\u00b0C and then thawed and used for titration before experimental inoculation. The SPF chicks were obtained from a flock that had been raised for vaccine production in Brazil (Biovet, Sao Paulo, Brazil). The birds were kept in wire cages inside high-security isolation rooms and provided with feed and water ad libitum.",

It has been reported that PEMS causes alterations in the cells of the immune system, including down-regulation of macrophage function and a reduction in expression of lymphocyte subpopulations in the thymus and spleen (Heggens et al., 1998). However, in the present study there were no remarkable histological changes in the BF, thymus or spleen after infection, which is in accordance with a previous report (Teixeira et al., 2007). Moreover, in a retrospective review of previous work, the propagation of TCoV in turkey and chicken embryos via the amniotic route was documented and it was suggested that TCoV is not pathogenic to chickens; however, replication of the virus in the gut of chickens raises a question about the potential role of chickens as carriers of the virus (Adams and Hofstad, 1971, Ismail et al., 2003). The possibility of TCoV replication in cells other than those of the intestinal epithelium was not addressed by these previous studies.",

In spite of its localization (upper respiratory tract), there are large interstitial aggregates of B cells (Montgomery and Maslin, 1992). The concentration of plasma cells in the Harderian gland has been considered higher than in other avian organs (Payne, 1994). In the present study, the combination of IHC and RT-PCR demonstrated TCoV antigens and viral RNA in the Harderian gland of infected chicks. This observation supports the idea that TCoV has the ability to replicate at a low level, confirmed by virus re-isolation and subsequent sequencing of the partial spike gene; however, no clinical signs of a respiratory disorder were documented. Furthermore, no phylogenetic differences were observed between TCoV isolated in Brazil and the closely related American isolates (Breslin et al., 1999a, Breslin et al., 1999b; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008).",

As reported previously, TCoV alone does not damage the integrity of the intestines (Guy, 2003). Other organisms may contribute to the appearance and severity of clinical signs initiated, at least in experimental trials, by TCoV infections (Ismail et al., 2003). This was observed in the present study by infecting poults with TCoV isolated in Brazil, with mild microscopical lesions being documented in the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum. Finally, this study contains the first description of TCoV detected in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally infected chicks.",
