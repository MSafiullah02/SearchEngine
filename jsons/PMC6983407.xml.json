The recombinant FIPV-UU4 S protein was overexpressed in a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line. With 1,391 amino acids in its sequence, the expected molecular mass of the homotrimeric recombinant protein is 465 kDa. Nevertheless, size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated an apparent molecular mass of 722 kDa for the single elution peak, of which 192 kDa (27% of the total molecular mass) was ascribed to glycan moieties (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The extensive glycosylation and the trimeric state were confirmed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing and native conditions, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Importantly, immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that mouse anti\u2013FIPV-UU4 S protein serum was able to differentiate serotype I- and II-infected cells, thus establishing the potential of FIPV-UU4 S protein as a potent vaccine candidate for FIP treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). Using a 200-keV electron microscope, we determined the 3D electron density map of the FIPV-UU4 S protein to 3.3-\u00c5 resolution, which revealed a propeller-like homotrimer structure with an overall dimension of 180 \u00c5 in diameter and 170 \u00c5 in height (Fig. 1A, Table 1, SI Appendix, Figs. S2A and S3 A and B, and Movie S1). In contrast, all previously reported cryo-EM structures of CoV S proteins have adopted compact ellipsoidal shapes of which the host receptor-recognizing S1 subunits pack against the spring-loaded coiled-coil S2 subunits (SI Appendix, Table S1) (3, 17\u201321). Local resolution analysis indicated that the propeller-like regions of the EM map were less defined compared with that of the core regions, indicative of local dynamics (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E).",

The 3 monomers are intertwined through extensive interactions between the conserved S2 subunits, while the 3 S1 subunits form the propeller blades (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Detailed inspection of the EM map showed well-defined side-chain densities in most regions, including the interstrand disulfide bonds, attesting to the high quality of our EM-derived structural model (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D and Movie S2). After considering the electron densities of individual amino acids, many electron densities remained unaccounted for. It transpired that these additional densities correspond to the N-glycan structures (vide infra). Based on our cryo-EM structure, we defined 5 distinct domains within the S1 subunit: domain 0 (residues 1 to 275), domain A (residues 276 to 540), domain B (residues 541 to 695), domain C (residues 696 to 754), and domain D (residues 755 to 791). The S2 subunit consists of an S2\u2032 cleavage site (residues 969 to 978), a fusion peptide (residues 979 to 1055), and 2 heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), corresponding to residues 1056 to 1156 and 1342 to 1403, respectively. The electron density map corresponding to the HR2 domain of the C terminus (residues 1338 to 1391) could not be resolved, suggesting conformational heterogeneity that leads to loss of contrast after averaging over a large number of particle images (Fig. 1C). Likewise, the model of the 4 loop segments (residues 1 to 61, 391 to 410, 781 to 796, and 1337 to 1361) could not be built because of the loss of the corresponding EM maps, potentially due to intrinsic dynamics.",

            "text": "Glycosylation of CoV S proteins is implicated in protein folding (22), structure stability (22), virus entry, and receptor recognition (23\u201327). According to the sequence, 37 N-linked glycosylation sites are predicted for FIPV-UU4 S protein. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the de\u2013N-glycosylated tryptic peptides led to identification of 29 occupied N-glycosites based on the conversion of Asn to Asp upon PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2A). The remaining 8 predicted N-glycosylation sites, namely 27NTSH, 31NNSK, 482NYTD, 585NGSV, and 590NVTS in the S1 subunit, 1308NTTH in the S2 subunit, and 1352NQTK and 1357NLTA in HR2, were not verified due to the lack of corresponding tryptic peptides. To obtain an unbiased view of the range of N-glycans carried, the pool of released N-glycans was profiled by MALDI-MS after permethylation. Both high-mannose and \u00b1core-fucosylated, \u00b1sialylated complex-type N-glycans were evidently present, with Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) and a simple core-fucosylated biantennary structure contributing to the 2 most intense molecular ion signals detected (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Taking the average size of these 2 predominant N-glycan structures\u20141,768 Da for biantennary and 1,864 Da for M9\u2014that were released from the FIPV-UU4 S protein, a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer, namely ca. 200 kDa for a trimer, consistent with the 192-kDa glycan contribution as inferred from SEC-MALS data (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Collectively, it confirms that FIPV-UU4 S protein is indeed heavily N-glycosylated at most, if not all, of the predicted sites.",

The VPP-derived dataset was used to construct a 3D EM map, which showed better-defined protrusions with lower local resolutions as a result of conformational heterogeneity (SI Appendix, Figs. S2B and S5). Through different image-processing procedures, we could unambiguously build 28 N-linked glycan structures onto the atomic model, including 2 N-glycosylation sites, N585 and N590, which were not identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of the de\u2013N-glycosylated peptides (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). The reconstituted glycan EM densities were mostly limited to 1 or 2 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties linked to the asparagine side chains due to their intrinsic dynamics. Nonetheless, a number of well-defined glycan densities could be traced and modeled with up to 7 monosaccharide residues. In the case of N357 and N1218, we could resolve the densities that correspond to 2 GlcNAcs and up to 5 mannoses, which is indicative of these 2 sites being mostly glycosylated by high-mannose-type structures (Fig. 2 D and F and Movie S3).",

This brings the total of MS-verified N-glycosylation to 31 out of the predicted 37 sites (summarized in Fig. 2A). For each of the identified sites, the most abundant and hence most representative glycoforms were deduced from the relative peak intensities of the manually extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of the corresponding glycopeptides (SI Appendix, Table S2). For example, the XICs of glycopeptides derived from N1218 and N949 indicated that the major glycoforms correspond to an M9 high mannose and a nonsialylated, fucosylated biantennary complex-type glycan structure, respectively (Fig. 2 C and E, Left). Close examination of the EM density protruding from the side chain of N949 revealed additional density next to the first GlcNAc moiety linked to N949. We attributed this to a core fucose (Fuc), which is consistent with and fully corroborated by the corresponding glycopeptide MS/MS spectrum, which contained a diagnostic peptide backbone fragment ion carrying a GlcNAc and a Fuc (Y1+F; Fig. 2E).",

We employed an array of 100 glycan structures to test the lectin activities of full-length FIPV-UU4 S protein and 3 truncated variants, namely domain 0 only, domains 0 and A, and domains 0, A, and B (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods). Three groups of glycan structures were found to be recognized by all 4 variants, namely sialylated or core-Fuc Gal\u03b2(1\u21924)Glc\u03b2-core structures, sialylated Gal\u03b2(1\u21923)GalNAc\u03b2-core structures, and oligo-glucose (Glc) structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Notably, NeuAc sialylation at the 6 position of the inner GalNAc seems to be required (compound 67) while additional sialylation at the 6 position of Gal (compound 69) increased its affinity slightly. However, sialylation at the 6 position of Gal itself without the presence of sialylation on GalNAc (compound 68) did not support binding, whereas the additional presence of sialylation at the 3 position of Gal (compound 70) actually inhibited the binding slightly. Collectively, the glycan array data suggest that positive recognition and binding by domain 0 prefer a minimum Gal\u03b2(1\u21923)GalNAc\u03b2-core structure sialylated at the 6 position of GalNAc. Di- and tri-Glc with \u03b1-linkages could be recognized.

Several high-mannose-type glycans are located at the junctions between domains and appear to serve as wedges to maintain the domain architecture (Fig. 2B).

For example, a number of CoVs have been reported to exhibit hemagglutinin activity with some preference for sialylated oligosaccharides (39). Through glycan array analysis, we obtained experimental evidence of lectin activity for domain 0 of FIPV-UU4 S protein, which showed a distinct binding preference for a Gal\u03b2(1\u21923)GalNAc\u03b2-core structure sialylated at the 6 position of the inner GalNAc. If one disregards the anomericity of the GalNAc, this minimal NeuAc\u03b1(2\u21926)GalNAc\u03b1-determinant corresponds to the sialyl Tn epitope widely implicated as a cancer and CART antigen, and also being developed as a vaccine candidate. Follow-up binding studies including the use of custom-made O-glycans containing the actual sialyl Tn epitope and other core 1 O-glycans sialylated at different positions would be required to substantiate this intriguing finding that sialylated O-glycans on host cell surfaces might play an important role in viral recognition and infection of serotype I FIPV.",

Viral protein glycosylation might determine the host tropism (41), immunogenicity, and pathogenicity (42\u201346).

The structure reveals major structural differences in the S1 subunit from the only known example within the alphacoronavirus genera, HCoV-NL63 S protein, for which structural information is available. These results demonstrate how structurally divergent these S proteins can be despite their sequence homology (SI Appendix, Table S1). The integrated use of cryo-EM and MS reveals the unique domain architecture with detailed structural information regarding its glycosylation, the galectin-like N-terminal domains, and the location of the putative RBMs of serotype I FIPV. The high-resolution structure of FIPV-UU4 S protein may therefore serve as the blueprint for further mechanistic insights into viral host interactions of FIPV.",
