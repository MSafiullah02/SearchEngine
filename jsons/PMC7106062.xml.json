Children are less commonly infected than adults, they have milder disease, are less infectious and present with non-specific clinical features. However, severe illness can develop in adolescents and young infants.1, 2 Detailed infection control guidances on SARS have been prepared by WHO, US Center for Disease Control, Health Canada, Health Protection Agency of UK, Ministry of Health Singapore, CDC of China, CDC of Taiwan and the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. A comprehensive review and account of infection control measures will not be attempted. This article makes special reference to children, is based on personal experience and on local systems developed in Hong Kong. It may need modifying to suit local situations and will need to be updated as new knowledge arises.",

Pneumonia developed in six, two had mild illness and one remained asymptomatic.16 The emergency department is a high-risk area because of its nature of trauma, heavy workload, crowded environment and lack of isolation facilities. There were at least two outbreaks in community clinic settings in Hong Kong. In one, a nurse was first infected by a SARS patient attending the clinic and subsequently infected two other nurses, the doctor and his wife. In the second, a doctor was found to be infected on contact tracing of a household cluster of four SARS cases. On further case tracing two more of the doctor's patients were found to be infected.17 Despite great concerns, compliance to infection control precautions by community general practitioners in Hong Kong lagged behind their hospital counterparts \u2013 97.7% had not worn masks at all times, a third did not wash their hands after seeing/examining a patient and half did not wear gowns. Three-quarters did not wear goggles during patient encounters, just over half insisted patients wore masks during their consultation and over 10 doctors (12.4%) who were diagnosed with suspected or probable SARS had closed their clinics.18 However, the sample size is small and may not be representative of community doctors in Hong Kong. Healthcare workers (HCWs) working in small clinics are of particular concern because of their small size and lack of adequate decontamination facilities and a good ventilation system.
