However, this study did not include suspected cases that were SARS-CoV-2 negative. RT-PCR results\u2014the gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection\u2014corresponding to the CT findings were also not reported. Thus, the concordance between CT findings and laboratory tests was unknown. Another study showed a contradictory finding that seven (37%) of 19 asymptomatic cases had positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of CT changes.2 Therefore, we have adequate reason to doubt whether CT is suitable for screening asymptomatic infections.",

Furthermore, studies have shown that the secondary attack rate among close contacts is 9\u00b76% (95% CI 7\u00b79\u201311\u00b78),4 and asymptomatic patients account for only 1\u00b72% of total SARS-CoV-2 infections.5 These data show the little additional value CT screening has for early diagnosis of COVID-19.",

We believe that use of CT in screening or early diagnosis in high-risk groups should balance risks and benefits to reduce radiation dose and potential disease burden. On the basis of current evidence and experience, we suggest that there should be clear criteria for the use of CT in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One criterion would be to have symptoms or signs of infection or to identify close contacts and have a positive nucleic acid screening test; another would be to treat or determine the course of the disease. Otherwise, CT should not be recommended for screening or early diagnosis.",
