MERS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The replication cycle is similar to other CoVs. The host cell receptor for the MERS-CoV S protein is dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) or CD26. This receptor is expressed on endothelial and epithelial cells of the kidney, lung, small intestine, liver, as well as on immune cells. This ability to infect many different organ cells may explain the extrapulmonary clinical characteristics in patients. After uncoating, there is translation of ORF/a/b, followed by transcription and genome replication. Following translation on the rough ER, budding and assembly of virions occur in the cytoplasm with exocytosis and virion release. ACE2 is a SARS-CoV receptor. Upon SARS-CoV infection, ACE2 expression in lungs is markedly downregulated and therefore helps explain SARS pathogenesis and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (Table 5).",

In epidemiologic studies in adults, coronaviruses were estimated to cause 15% of adult common colds. Coronaviruses were found to cause epidemics every 2 to 3 years with reinfections being common. All ages are susceptible. From epidemiologic studies, coronaviruses were found to be associated with respiratory illnesses, usually in the upper respiratory tract, but occasionally causing pneumonia. In temperate climates, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are transmitted primarily during the winter. They have been linked to asthma and COPD exacerbations in children and adults.125\n213\n",

N protein-specific immune response provides little protection and only cross-react within, but not between, subgroups. Thus, there are no approved vaccines for MERS or any of the CoVs.

The single-stranded, positive-sense coronavirus genomes encode the structural proteins (blue), membrane (M), spike (S), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), two replicase polyproteins (purple), ORF1a and ORF1b, and unique accessory proteins (red) that perform important functions in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis, such as blocking the innate immune signaling pathway. (B) Transmission routes. SARS-CoV transmission is thought to be from bats harboring SARS-like viruses to palm civet cats, which infected humans. SARS-CoV could also have been transmitted from bats to humans directly. MERS-CoV is thought to be transmitted from camels to humans, with the possibility that at some point bats infected camels. The dashed line identifies a low-level transmission event, the thin solid line identified a potential transmission event, and the thick solid line identifies a probable transmission event.
