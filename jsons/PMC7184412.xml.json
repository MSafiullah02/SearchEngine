This may be because different measures taken by the authorities apply to different groups or because the same measure impacts differently on different groups. For instance, if quarantining measures (e.g. self-isolation) are seen as disproportionately penalizing poorer groups in society (who are less able to afford time off work), then there is a real potential for social division between the \u2018haves\u2019 and the \u2018have nots\u2019. The risk may be amplified when agencies who then enforce such measures (i.e. police, army, etc.) are then seen as agents of privileged groups rather than neutral guardians of law and order. In such circumstances, there is a danger of these enforcement agencies becoming seen as the illegitimate agent of the \u2018other\u2019 and for a loss of trust and conflict to emerge. In such contexts, minor confrontations in one location can then be seen by others in different locations as indicative of wider illegitimacies in their relationship to authority and disorder can begin to escalate and spread (Stott et al., 2018; Ball et al., 2019; Drury et al., 2019).",

As a result, people and communities will be more likely to self-regulate (for instance, complying with the instructions of authority figures, spontaneously challenging those who act against the communal interest) and to be more positive towards external regulation by the police and other agencies. From this perspective, the public are potentially the most powerful resource that the authorities have to deal with emergencies. The role of the police and other authorities, then, is to work with citizens to scaffold, rather than substitute for (or, at worst, suppress) community \u2018self-regulation\u2019. Moreover, insofar as they are able to act in this way, the police come to be seen as \u2018of us\u2019 and \u2018for us\u2019 (Reicher et al., 2004; Reicher et al., 2007; Stott et al., 2008).",

With careful management both at a general policy level and in terms of sensitive community-based and dialogue-led policing, it will be possible to maintain a sense of common endeavour and, hence, to draw on the community as a key resource in dealing with the crisis. The two keys are to build a sense of \u2018us-ness\u2019\u2014of shared identity and shared fate\u2014at every decision point and to be especially sensitive to any fault lines in the community which could lead particular groups (including the authorities) to be seen as \u2018them\u2019 rather than \u2018us\u2019.",
