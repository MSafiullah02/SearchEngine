However, knowledge of the blood circulation continued to grow rapidly in the last century [1]. Two different theories are proposed which are in favour of origin of the lymphatic vessels. Firstly, centrifugal theory of embryologic origin of the lymphatics was described in the early twentieth century by Sabin and later by Lewis, postulating that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are derived from the venous endothelium. Later the centripetal theory of lymphatic development was proposed by Huntington and McClure in 1910 which describes the development of the lymphatic system beginning with lymphangioblasts, mesenchymal progenitor cells, arising independently of veins. The venous connection to the lymphatic system then happens later in development [2].",

Recent studies provide strong support of the venous origin of lymphatic vessels [5\u20138]. The recent discovery of various molecular markers has allowed for more in-depth research of the lymphatic system and its role in health and disease. The lymphatic system has recently been elucidated as playing an active role in cancer metastasis. The knowledge of the active processes involved in lymphatic metastasis provides novel treatment targets for various malignancies.",

The lymphatic system serves as the body\u2019s second vascular system in vertebrates and functions co-dependently with the cardiovascular system [9, 10]. The lymphatic system comprises a single irreversible, open-ended transit network without a principal driving force [9]. It consists of five main types of conduits including the capillaries, collecting vessels, lymph nodes, trunks and ducts. The lymphatic system originates in the dermis with initial lymphatic vessels and blind-ended lymphatic capillaries that are nearly equivalent in size to but less abundant than regular capillaries [9, 11]. Lymphatic capillaries consist of a single layer of thin-walled, non-fenestrated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), alike to blood capillaries. The LECs, on the contrary to blood vessels, have poorly developed basement membrane and lack tight junctions and adherent junctions too. These very porous capillaries act as gateway for large particles, cells and interstitial fluid. Particles as large as 100 nm in diameter can extravasate into the interstitial space, get phagocytosed by macrophages and are ultimately passed on to lymph nodes [11\u201314]. Lymphatic capillary endothelial cells are affixed to the extracellular matrix by elastic anchoring filaments, which check vessel collapse under high interstitial pressure. These initial lymphatics, under a positive pressure gradient, distend and create an opening between loosely anchored endothelial cells letting for the entry of lymph, a protein-rich exudate from the blood capillaries [12, 15, 16]. In initial lymphatic vessels, overlying endothelial cell\u2013cell contacts prevent fluid reflux back into the interstitial space [17, 18].",

Lymph is received from the initial capillary lymphatic by deeper collecting vessels that contain valves to maintain unidirectional flow of lymph. These collecting vessels have basement membranes and are surrounded by smooth muscle cells with intrinsic contractile activity that in combination with contraction of surrounding skeletal muscles and arterial pulsations propels the lymph to lymph nodes [19\u201321]. The collecting lymphatic vessels unite into lymphatic trunks, and the lymph is finally returned to the venous circulation via the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein [22, 23]. The flow of lymph toward the circulatory system is supported by increases in interstitial pressure as well as contractions of the lymphatic vessels themselves. Roughly 25 l of lymphatic fluid enters the cardiovascular system each day [11].",

Lymphatics transport the antigen-presenting cells as well as antigens from the interstitium of peripheral tissues to the draining lymph nodes where they initiate immune responses via B- and T-cells in the lymph nodes [9, 12, 24, 25]. Tissue fluid balance is maintained by restoring interstitial fluid to the cardiovascular system [9]. Although capillaries have very low permeability to proteins, these molecules as well as other macromolecules and bacteria accumulate in the interstitium. Due to the accumulation of these large molecules in the interstitium, significant tissue oedema would result. The lymphatic system offers the mechanism by which these large molecules re-enter the blood circulation [26]. The lymphatic system is the site of many diseases such as metastitial tuberculosis (TB), cancer and filariasis [27]. Due to the peculiar nature and anatomy of the lymphatic system, localisation of drugs in the lymphatics has been particularly difficult to achieve.",

Although many cancers may be treated with surgical resection, microscopic disease may remain and lead to locoregional recurrence. Conventional systemic chemotherapy cannot prove effective for delivering drugs to the lymphatic system without dose-limiting toxicities [28]. Lymphatic system functions in the clearance of particulate matter from the interstitium following presentation to lymph nodes have created interest in developing microparticulate systems to target regional lymph nodes. Molecule\u2019s composition is important in determining uptake into the lymphatics and retention within the lymph nodes. Colloidal materials, for example, liposomes, activated carbon particles, emulsions, lipids and polymeric particulates, are highly taken up by the lymphatics; that\u2019s why nowadays these substances are emerging as potential carriers for lymphatic drug targeting [29]. The vast majority of drugs following oral administration are absorbed directly into portal blood, but a number of lipophilic molecules may get access to the systemic circulation via the lymphatic pathway [30, 31]. Intestinal lymphatic transport of lipophilic molecules is significant and presents benefits in a number of situations:\nThe total systemic bioavailability of lipophilic molecules may be increased, and the hepatic first-pass metabolism may be reduced by the intestinal lymphatic absorption [30].Targeting immunomodulatory agents, cytotoxic agents and drugs used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to the lymphatic system has a potential to maximise therapeutic benefits and minimise systemic exposure [30, 32].Following association of the drug with chylomicrons, intestinal lymphatic transport may alter the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug [32\u201335].\n",

Therefore, lymphatic absorption of the immunomodulatory and anticancer compounds may be more effective [38, 39]. The presence of wide amounts of HIV-susceptible immune cells in the lymphoid organs makes antiretroviral drug targeting to these sites of tremendous interest in HIV therapy. This strategy comprises once again targeting nanosystems to immune cell populations, particularly macrophages. Also evidence further suggests that lymph and lymphoid tissue, and in particular gut-associated lymphoid tissue, play a major role in the development of HIV and antivirals which target acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may therefore be more effective when absorbed via the intestinal lymphatics [40, 41]. Other viruses like hepatitis B [42] and morbillivirus [43] (which also replicate in gut-associated lymphoid tissue) and the closely related canine distemper virus [44] including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [45] may also spread via the lymphatic network, and the chronic persistence of hepatitis C is believed to result from uptake into systemic lymphocytes and sequestration into the lymph [46].",

According to one literature, computed tomography of the chest was performed on eight patients infected with inhalational anthrax. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found in seven of the eight patients [59]. In another case report of a patient, the anthrax bacillus was shown to be rapidly sterilised within the blood stream after initiation of antibiotic therapy. However, viable anthrax bacteria were still present in postmortem mediastinal lymph node specimens [60]. Treatment and control of these diseases are hard to accomplish because of the limited access of drugs to mediastinal nodes using common pathways of drug delivery.

Drugs entering the intestinal lymphatic through the intestinal lumen avoid liver and first-pass metabolism as they first migrate to lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes before entering systemic circulation. Lymphatic uptake of carriers via the intestinal route increases bioavailability of a number of drugs. For oral delivery of drug-encapsulated liposomal formulations, intestinal absorbability and stability are the primary formulation concerns. Ling et al. evaluated oral delivery of a poorly bioavailable hydrophilic drug, cefotaxime, in three different forms: liposomal formulation, aqueous-free drug and a physical mixture of the drug and empty liposomes [75]. The liposomal formulation of the drug turned out to exhibit a 2.7-fold increase in its oral bioavailability compared to the aqueous dosage and a 2.3-fold increase for the physical mixture. They also accounted that the liposomal formulation leads to a significant enhancement of the lymphatic localisation of the drug relative to the other two formulations. As a result, liposome systems emerged as useful carriers for poorly bioavailable hydrophilic drugs, promoting their lymphatic transport in the intestinal lymph as well as their systemic bioavailability.",

Liposomal delivery of anticancer drug actinomycin D via intratesticular injection has shown greater concentration of the drug in the local lymph nodes. Furthermore, a study by Hirnle et al. found liposomes as a better carrier for intralymphatically delivered drugs contrasted with bleomycin emulsions [81]. Systemic liposomal chemotherapy is preferred mainly because of its reduced side effects compared to the standard therapy and improved inhibition of the anticancer drugs from enzymatic digestion in the systemic circulation. Effective chemotherapy by pulmonary route could overcome various lacunas associated with systemic chemotherapy like serious non-targeted toxicities, poor drug penetration into the lymphatic vessels and surrounding lymph node and first-pass clearance concentrating drugs in the lungs and draining lymphatics in the case of oral delivery.",

Gadolinium (Gd)-containing dendrimers of different sizes and molecular structures (PAMAM-G8, PAMAM-G4 and DAB-G5) (PAMAM, polyamidoamine; DAB, diaminobutyl) are used as contrast agents. Size and molecular structure play a great role in distribution and pharmacokinetics of dendrimers. For example, PAMAM-G8 when injected intravenously had a comparatively long life in the circulatory system with minimum leakage out of the vessels, whereas PAMAM-G4 cleared rapidly from the systemic circulation due to rapid renal clearance but had immediate survival in lymphatic circulation. The smaller-sized DAB-G5 showed greater accumulation and retention in lymph nodes useful for lymph node imaging using MR-LG. Gadomer-17 and Gd-DTPA\u2013dimeglumine (Magnevist) were evaluated as controls. Imaging experiments revealed that all of the reagents are able to visualise the deep lymphatic system except Gd-DTPA\u2013dimeglumine. To visualise the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, PAMAM-G8 and DAB-G5 were used, respectively. While PAMAM-G4 provided good contrast of both the nodes and connecting vessels, Gadomer-17 was able to visualise lymph nodes, but not as clear as Gd-based dendrimers. Kobayashi also delivered various Gd-PAMAM (PAMAM-G2, PAMAM-G4, PAMAM-G6, PAMAM-G8) and DAB-G5 dendrimers to the sentinel lymph nodes and evaluated its visualisation with other nodes. The G6 dendrimer provided excellent opacification of sentinel lymph nodes and was able to be absorbed and retained in the lymphatic system [103].",

Silica particle-adsorbed bleomycin showed considerable inhibitory effect on tumour growth and lymph node metastasis compared to free bleomycin solution [110]. Activated carbon particles of aclarubicin are used for adsorption and sustained release into lymph nodes. Upon subcutaneous administration into the fore foot-pads of rats these particles showed significantly elevated distribution of aclarubicin to the auxiliary lymph nodes compared to aqueous solution of the drug [111].

They estimated the lymphatic uptake and lymph node retention properties of several generation four dendrimers coated with PEG or 4-benzene sulphonate after subcutaneous administration in rats. For this surface modification study, three types of PEGs with molecular weights of 200, 570 or 2,000 Da were taken. PEG200-derived dendrimers showed rapid and complete absorption into the blood when injected subcutaneously, and only 3 % of the total given dose was found in the pooled thoracic lymph over 30 h, whereas PEG570- and PEG2000-derived dendrimers showed lesser absorption, and a higher amount was recovered in lymphatics (29 %) over 30 h. However, the benzene sulphonate-capped dendrimer was not well absorbed either in the blood or in lymph following subcutaneous injection [150].",

Biotin is a naturally occurring cofactor and avidin is a protein derived from eggs. Avidin and biotin are having extremely high affinity for each other. For instance, upon injection, the avidin and the biotin liposomes move into the lymphatic vessels. Biotin liposomes that migrate through the lymphatic vessels meet the avidin resulting in an aggregate that becomes trapped in the lymph nodes [155, 156]. The biotin liposome/avidin system has promising potential as therapeutic agent for delivery to lymph nodes. It can be applied not only to s.c. targeting of lymph nodes but also to intracavitary lymph node targeting [50].",

Currently, the focus is on the development of drug carriers that can localise chemotherapy to the lymphatic system, thus improving the treatment of localised disease while minimising the exposure of healthy organs to cytotoxic drugs. The delivery of novel carriers to lymph nodes for therapeutic purposes has much promise. Giving importance to the lymphatic route in metastasis, this delivery system may have great potential for targeted delivery of various therapeutic agents to tumours and their metastatic lymph nodes. Various delivery systems have been discussed here but colloidal carriers, especially, liposomes have been the carrier of choice to date. The purpose of this review is to provide an improved and effective lymphotropic system with a satisfactory quality for clinical use and to establish a preparation method applicable for industrial production. Surface-engineered lymphotropic systems may prove as an effective carrier for anti-HIV, anticancer and oral vaccine delivery in near future.",
