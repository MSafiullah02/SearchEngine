EDs in high-income countries are not immune, but those in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are likely to be impacted more significantly. Emerging data speak to overwhelming demands for care and widespread disruption of hospital functioning. 1 In order to support colleagues in resource-limited settings, the Australasian College from Emergency Medicine (ACEM) has developed a free guide for emergency care (EC) clinicians in LMICs preparing for a surge of patients with COVID-19. 2 Content was developed by a working party of ACEM's Global Emergency Care Committee and included EC clinicians from Timor Leste, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The guide provides consensus-based advice on optimising resource utilisation during the pandemic and draws heavily on technical guidance from the WHO. 3 It is intended to complement, not replace, local and national guidelines.",

A small number of boxes provide specific guidance to clinicians on triage and screening, infection prevention and control and clinical management. Figure 1 reproduces the section of the guide dedicated to 'systems'. EC clinicians in LMICs will be deeply impacted by COVID-19, and there is a substantial risk of burnout and moral injury. ACEM's guide is an attempt to express solidarity with colleagues in resource-limited settings and will hopefully stimulate further collaboration among the global EC community.",
