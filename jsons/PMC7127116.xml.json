The clinical presentation can be as cutaneous, inhalational or gastrointestinal forms that are fortuitously not transmissible from person to person. As the October 2001 anthrax cases showed, the insidious nature of anthrax has both a vegetative and spore morphology. The vegetative state, being the growth phase, is typically responsive to most classes of antibiotics, while the spore phase is not. Thus, long treatment modalities with systemic antibiotics for the deadly inhalation form are necessary in order to inhibit all of the organisms that convert from the spore state to the vegetative state [4]. This requires anti-infectives with safety profiles adequate for several months of administration. A major advance would be the discovery of antibiotics that are effective against the spore phase or stationary phase of these pathogens.",
