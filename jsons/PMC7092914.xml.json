The coding sequence of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5\u2032-AGTGGTTTTAGGAAAATGGCATTCCCGTCAGGC-3\u2032, and the reverse primer, 5\u2032-GTGACAAGCTTCTATTGGAAGGTAACACCAGAGC-3\u2032. After amplification, the PCR product was digested by HindIII and ligated into XmnI/HindIII-digested pMAL-c2x DNA (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to generate plasmid pMAL-3CL, which was transformed into TB1 cells. To induce expression of the fusion protein, E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP)\u20133CLpro, 0.3 mM isopropyl thio-\u03b2-d-galactoside was added and incubation was continued for 3 h, and then the transformed cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. 3CLpro was purified essentially as described previously for 3CLpro from another coronavirus [14], [15]. Briefly, the cells were sonicated in buffer A (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA), then the homogenate was centrifuged (4000g, 20 min, 4 \u00b0C) and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto an amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs) and the fusion protein was eluted with buffer A containing 10 mM maltose. Following Factor Xa cleavage of the eluted fusion protein, the released 3CLpro was isolated by applying the material to a phenyl Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and collecting the 3CLpro fraction, which was dialyzed against buffer A, concentrated (YM-10, Millipore, Bedford, WA), and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. The concentration of the protein was determined using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.",

Control reactions were carried out using the same reaction mixture without the test compound (no inhibition) or without the enzyme (blank).

The present FRET peptide (MW 1490 Da) is the smallest to be used in such studies, but still large enough to be recognized by SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The purified enzyme was assayed using the FRET technique described under Materials and methods; an evaluation of the performance of the assay is shown in Fig. 1\n, which shows 48 readings for the basal and maximal signals. The basal signals (signal in the absence of enzyme) for the 48 replicates were quite low and similar. The maximal signals (signal after enzyme reaction) for the 48 replicates showed a little variation, but were quite high, and the detection window (difference between the maximal and basal readings) was good and the signal-to-noise ratio about 20. The Z\u2032-factor value for the assay was 0.81, which corresponds to a stable and excellent system [16]. Thus, this approach was suitable for a high-throughput screening method. We concluded that this system could be used as a simple, continuous, and rapid screening assay for identifying candidates for SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors in compound libraries.",

Nine commercially available compounds whose structures have high similarity with hexachlorophene were investigated (Fig. 4\n). These compounds dose-dependently inhibited the SARS-CoV 3CLpro activity. As shown in Fig. 5\n, HL-5 and HL-6 exhibited inhibitory activity higher than those of other compounds and their IC50 values were 9.2 and 7.6 \u03bcM, respectively. All of nigh compounds showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro, with IC50 values ranging from 7.6 to 84.5 \u03bcM.",

Therefore, hexachlorophene can be regarded as a lead compound for SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors and the structures of hexachlorophene-like compounds can be used as the basis for further optimization of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. Furthermore, our kinetic study showed that hexachlorophene competed with the substrate for the active center. From the docking result, it also implicated that two hydrogen bonds exist between Cys-145 and hexachlorophene. We speculate that hexachlorophene interacts with the active site Cys-145 and hexachlorophene or its analogues may be used to treat SARS disease in humans.",
