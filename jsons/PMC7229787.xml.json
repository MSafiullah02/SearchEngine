The studies included in this analysis comprise the latest research available on COVID-19 through 16 March 2020. Our results indicate that there is a slightly higher proportion of male patients (53.3%) and that the main symptoms of this disease are fever (78.4%), cough (58.3%) and fatigue (34%). Compared with previous results,9 10 our findings reveal lower incidence rates of the two major symptoms of this disease, which we found to depend to some extent on whether diagnosis was made before or after 31 January 2020, reflecting with the progress of the epidemic, the number of atypical manifestations has growed gradually. For example, some patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. These results highlight the importance of also taking into account non-respiratory symptoms of the disease.",

In this study, 49.4% of the patients presented with myocardial enzyme spectrum abnormalities, which manifested as an increase in lactate dehydrogenase levels. Studies have shown that elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase can be a risk factor for rapid progression from mild to critical COVID-19.65 Therefore, monitoring the function of important organs during treatment is critical, and treatment should be adjusted as needed to preserve and maintain organ function.",

An analysis by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted through 17 February 2020 suggested that the proportion of asymptomatic patients was only around 1%,67 but our results suggest that the proportion is closer to 5%. This increase may reflect the growing experience of hospitals with this novel disease and increasing screening of suspected COVID-19 cases for viral infection, allowing the correct diagnosis of greater proportions of patients showing no or less typical manifestations. Therefore, to control the spread of this disease, general practitioners should carefully monitor individuals with histories of contact in areas where outbreaks have occurred or who had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 within 14 days before onset of symptoms.68 Epidemiological history of patients should be investigated in detail, and asymptomatic infected people in the community should be identified as quickly as possible to control spread of the disease.",
