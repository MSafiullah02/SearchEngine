            "text": "Attachment to the intestinal epithelium allows the bacteria to maintain residence in the small intestine and multiply instead of being passed though with the ingesta. Studies have shown that up to 80% of the organisms are attached in calves with ETEC diarrhea, instead of only 10% to 20% in normal calves.3, 9, 10 This attachment is mediated by the presence of fimbrial antigens. The antigen most commonly associated with ETEC diarrhea in calves is K99, which is more appropriately referred to as F5.6, 11 The F41 and 987P antigens can also be found in calf ETEC isolates, often in conjunction with F5.12, 13 Because the K99 antigen is only expressed at an environmental pH level of less than 6.5, the distal small intestine is the initial site of colonization. This is because the pH level of the intestinal fluid increases as it moves caudally, and it only reaches this threshold at the ileum.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 The ability of K99 ETEC to bind to the small intestinal epithelium is age dependent and gradually decreases from 12 hours of age to 2 weeks of age. However, there is not a precipitous drop in the binding ability that would explain the age resistance to ETEC.19 The attachment of ETEC allows the bacteria to colonize the ileum, proliferate, and spread proximally through the small intestine.3, 17, 18, 20 Once established in the gut, ETEC produces heat stable toxin leading to secretory diarrhea.",

            "text": "Classically, mechanistic discussions of enterotoxin-mediated secretory diarrhea have focused on the cholera toxin of Vibrio cholerae and the heat labile toxin (LT) of E coli. These are both significant causes of diarrhea in humans, and have a similar mechanism of action involving increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophospate (cAMP), which activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and ultimately causes secretion of chloride. This movement of chloride ions osmotically draws water into the lumen of the intestine, leading to diarrhea.21, 22 These models of human diarrhea have less bearing on toxin-mediated secretory diarrhea in the calf because the heat stabile toxin (STa) of ETEC is the primary mediator.11, 23, 24 STa is an 18- or 19-amino-acid peptide that is secreted by many strains of ETEC; however, the production can vary up to 1,000 fold between strains when cultured under identical conditions.25, 26 After being secreted by E coli, STa binds to guanylyl cyclase-C (GCC), a brush border membrane enzyme that is present throughout the villi and crypts.27, 28 The concentration of GCC appears to be highest in the lower villous,28 but this may vary by species,27 and its precise location on the villous has not yet been determined in the calf. In contrast to rodents and humans, in which concentrations of GCC decrease in the distal small intestine,28 GCC is present throughout the gastrointestinal tract of calves and is concentrated in the ileum.29, 30 In both mice and humans, the density of this receptor declines after birth,26, 31 and it remains present in pigs until up to 7 weeks of age.32 No specific research has been done detailing the expression of GCC at various ages of calves, however inoculation with STa induces diarrhea in animals up to 15 days of age.25 This indicates that GCC is present until at least 2 weeks of age and down-regulation of the receptor is not the reason for age-dependent resistance to ETEC diarrhea.",

An opposing model of STa-induced diarrhea has also been proposed that is not based on fluid secretion caused by movement of chloride or bicarbonate, but which instead is caused by decreased fluid absorption. In addition to activating the CFTR, STa inhibits the apical Na-H exchanger, leading to failure of sodium absorption. This failure of sodium absorption decreases fluid movement from the intestinal lumen to the interstitial space. The importance of this mechanism of ETEC diarrhea in calves is unknown because this has been most conclusively shown in the duodenum and proximal jejunum of rodent models.37, 38\n",

Once ingested, ETEC must survive the acidic pH of the abomasum. This is facilitated in neonatal calves because the pH level of their abomasum ranges from approximately 6 to 7, which enables survival of ETEC. The pH of the abomasum decreases to less than 2 by 5 days of age, which is low enough to kill ETEC strains.18, 50 Once ETEC reaches the ileum, both the K99 antigen and STa are expressed as a result of the increased pH level, yet this may occur sooner because the pH level can be higher in the proximal GI tract of neonatal calves. K99 allows attachment of the organism, leading to colonization of the ileum. Production of STa induces secretion and may increase the luminal pH level, which would make the normally acidic proximal small intestine more hospitable for the organism. ETEC bacteria then move proximally toward the duodenum, and secretion dramatically increases, leading to diarrhea and dehydration.18, 51\n",

Furthermore, the incidence of apoptosis will vary over time between infected cells and uninfected neighboring cells. This may be beneficial to the host to limit spread of the organism, limit the severity of cell loss, and/or speed clearance of the organism.83 Pharmacologically induced apoptosis in infected cell cultures is also prevented, indicating that apoptosis mechanisms are actively inhibited,78, 83 which has been shown to be mediated by NF-\u03baB.78 Additional research is needed to elucidate the ultimate beneficiary of this apoptotic regulation: the organism, to maintain its intracellular habitat, or the host, to limit cell loss and spread of infection.",

The prostaglandins PGE2 and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) are found at higher concentrations in infected tissue, and blocking the secretion of these prostaglandins reverses the anion secretion and inhibition of NaCl absorption.70, 84 However, in vivo, inhibition of prostaglandins exacerbated the villous atrophy, indicating that this approach is unlikely to be useful therapeutically.92 The source of prostaglandins in the infected tissue is unknown, but is believed to be leukocytes that infiltrate the lamina propria in the infection. Macrophages appear to be the most likely source because they invade the lamina propria after infection and can induce prostaglandin secretion from mesenchymal cells,64, 70, 92, 93 whereas inhibition of neutrophil migration into infected tissue had no effect on prostaglandin synthesis.94 Furthermore, NO, which has been shown to be important in defense against C parvum infections,95 stimulates prostaglandin-mediated secretion when NO production is augmented by arginine supplementation.96\n",

PGI2 causes 75% of the secretion in C parvum infection by stimulating the nicotinic ganglia and the VIP-ergic and cholinergic motor neurons that innervate the intestinal mucosa. Prostaglandin secretion ultimately leads to increases in calcium and cAMP that increase anion secretion and decrease sodium absorption.42, 70, 92 Inhibiting the effects of prostaglandins on the ENS is a potential method of decreasing the diarrhea associated with C parvum without exacerbating the villous atrophy. Specifically, peptide YY, which is naturally found in the intestinal epithelium, is a potent inhibitor of VIP and can abolish the secretory response to PGI2.97 Furthermore, if the inhibition caused by prostaglandins can be blocked, the intestine is capable of absorbing NaCl and water despite the villous atrophy, indicating that the transporters are fully functional, even in the immature enterocytes.85, 86, 87\n",

            "text": "Because of the privileged location of C parvum, drug delivery can be difficult. Drugs in the lumen of the intestine may pass through without actually reaching the organism, whereas drugs that penetrate the intestinal epithelial cell would concentrate in the cytoplasm instead of the extracytoplasmic parasitophorous vacuole. Despite these challenges, multiple drugs have been studied as potential treatments with varying degrees of success, and none are currently licensed for calves in North America.55, 57 Halofuginone is licensed for prevention of C parvum infection in Europe when administered during the first 7 days of life. Unfortunately, clinical trials have not shown it be consistently effective. When used as directed in a study of 31 bull calves, there was no difference in the incidence of or treatment rates for diarrhea between the treated and control calves. There was a significant delay in shedding of oocysts, but upon withdrawal of the drug, the treated calves began to shed a similar number of organisms. There was no difference in milk intake, weight gain, or age at weaning between the two groups.98 Another study in which halofuginone treatment was initiated at 7 to 10 days of age saw no difference in the number of calves shedding oocysts or in the incidence of diarrhea. However, the total number of oocysts shed was reduced for the 7 days during treatment as well as the following 7 days. Oocyst shedding then rebounded and was greater than in control animals 21 days after the start of treatment.99 Other studies have shown more favorable results in which the incidence of diarrhea and excretion of oocysts was reduced. Re-excretion of oocysts after stopping treatment continued to be a problem, but was less if a lower dose was used.100, 101, 102 In an experimental infection, the only difference noted with treatment was a decrease in the number of calves dying. However, calves began excreting oocysts after treatment was discontinued, even though they had been housed individually and reinfection was unlikely. This indicates that halofuginone is cryptosporidiostatic but is unlikely to effectively kill oocysts.103 Halofuginone appears to be effective at decreasing oocyst shedding only when it is being administered. It may or may not reduce clinical signs in the calf, and has not been consistently shown to be effective as a treatment for C parvum diarrhea.",

Treatment decreased oocyst shedding and diarrhea, and improved weight gain.106 However, the cost of azithromycin in the United States would likely prevent its use to treat cryptosporidiosis at this time.

Malabsorption will then occur because of the loss of surface area, and unabsorbed glucose and other carbohydrates create an osmotic load pulling fluid into the lumen. Furthermore, fluid secretion from the crypts increases the amount of fluid in the intestinal lumen relative to villous absorption, which leads to diarrhea.21, 114, 115 However, the severity of clinical signs does not always correlate with histologic damage to the villi.

Unlike the bacterial enterotoxins, diarrhea due to NSP4 is unrelated to cAMP, cGMP, or CFTR.123, 124 The protein is initially produced during intracellular viral replication and acts on the infected cell. It is secreted or released upon cell death, and acts in a paracrine manner.125 Exogenous exposure of intestinal epithelial cells to NSP4 allows binding to caveolae, special lipid rafts within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cell membrane. It specifically binds to caveolin-1, a transmembrane, hairpin protein unique to these rafts.126, 127 Binding to caveolin-1 leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations by causing the release of calcium from ER stores and increasing movement across the plasma membrane. This is mediated by phospholipase C (PLC), which increases the level of intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3),124, 128, 129, 130 however intracellular NSP4 causes the release of calcium independent of the PLC pathway.131\n",

Pharmacologically inhibiting the ENS dramatically reduces the diarrhea seen with rotavirus infections, although the mechanism by which the virus activates ENS-dependent secretion is unknown.42, 114, 138 Prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators may also play a role in causing secretion by affecting the ENS,137 similar to other intestinal pathogens such as C parvum.42, 70, 92 The ENS appears to play a critical role in rotavirus-induced secretion, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear.",

These bacteria are characterized by the presence of the eae gene,156 which encodes the protein intimin, a key component of the outer membrane that mediates attachment to the intestinal epithelium.157 If these bacteria do not secrete any enterotoxins, they are classified as enterpathogenic E coli (EPEC).157 EPEC organisms attach to the epithelium, disrupt the microvilli, and cause malabsorption.158 They also use a Type III secretory protein to inject effector proteins into the host cell, inducing a secretory response by an undefined mechanism. Furthermore, they disrupt tight junctions between epithelial cells and lead to inflammation; all of which contribute to diarrhea.159 The importance of EPEC as a pathogen of calves is debatable. It can be found in abnormal fecal samples, but is also frequently found in healthy calves160 or not found at all.161\n",

Since that time, it has been identified in both beef and dairy calves throughout the world, and 94% of adult cattle are seropositive.188 Torovirus is found in calves with normal and abnormal feces, but is isolated more frequently in diarrheic feces. The incidence in calves with diarrhea ranged from 5% to 35%, while it was never isolated from more than 12% of normal calves. Other pathogens were commonly, but not always, found in conjunction with torovirus, but none appeared to be consistently associated with torovirus infection.189, 190, 191, 192, 193 After ingestion, the virus infects the epithelium of the distal half of the jejunum, the ileum, and colon. Histopathologic lesions in experimental infections include necrosis of the crypt and villous enterocytes and villous atrophy, but infection does not consistently lead to clinical signs or histologic damage.187, 194, 195 Although it has not been conclusively shown, these lesions would be expected to lead to a malabsorptive diarrhea. There is no specific information on control of torovirus, but as with other viruses, proper housing, decreasing exposure to adult cattle, and good hygiene are likely important to prevent its spread.",

The enteric nervous system becomes activated by the secretion of STa, but the mechanism of this activation is unclear. At this point, CFTR is not active. Frame 2: STa binds to GCC, which converts guanylyl triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP. cGMP activates cGKII to phosphorylate the CFTR, and the CFTR moves to the luminal surface and is activated, leading to chloride (Cl) secretion. Frame 3: Secreted STa activates tyrosine kinase through an unknown pathway, which leads to bicarbonate (HCO3) secretion. STa also directly inhibits the sodium\u2013hydrogen exchanger, decreasing the movement of sodium (Na) and hydrogen (H) across the membrane.",

This activates PLC, which increases cytoplasmic IP3. IP3 increases intracellular calcium by increasing release from the endoplasmic reticulum and increasing calcium movement across the luminal membrane. The increased intracellular calcium inhibits movement of disaccharidases to the luminal surface. NSP4 directly inhibits the SGLT1 which decreases the absorption of sodium (Na) and glucose, and increases chloride (Cl) secretion by an unknown mechanism, but may involve a channel created by NSP4. NSP4 also activates the enteric nervous system by an unknown mechanism.",
