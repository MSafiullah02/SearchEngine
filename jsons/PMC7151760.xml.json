A complete physical examination should include a rectal examination to evaluate the bony pelvis and a digital vaginal examination to detect any vaginal abnormalities. Brucella canis serology using the rapid-slide agglutination test should be done. An in-house test is available (D-Tec CB, Synbiotics; www.synbiotics.com); this test has high sensitivity and low specificity. Any positive result requires additional testing and should cause a delay in breeding during the cycle in which test results are confirmed. Regardless of previous breeding history, all bitches should be evaluated because the disease is spread orally, as well as venereally. Serologic testing for canine herpes virus should be performed on virgin bitches or in bitches with a previously negative test. If the bitch has a negative titer, she must be protected from exposure to the virus. More detailed information pertaining to herpes virus can be found in Chapter 16.",

A bitch with total plasma protein levels of less than 5.0 gm/dl is unlikely to whelp a litter of strong, healthy puppies. Bitches with significant renal or hepatic dysfunction are not successful brood bitches. If the bitch has a history of infertility or pregnancy loss, a vaginal culture should be performed during the first 5 days of proestrus. Although the value of vaginal cultures is controversial, most clinicians consider a pure culture in significant numbers of a known pathogen to be worthy of treatment. The vaginal culture should be interpreted within the context of patient history, physical examination findings, and vaginal cytology. Both B. canis and Salmonella sp. are always considered pathogens. B. canis is rarely treated in any kennel or colony situation. In kennel situations, B. canis is managed in a test and cull manner because it is highly contagious and nearly impossible to eradicate with therapy. Antibiotic choice and duration of treatment should be based on safety and efficacy in pregnancy. Bitches that have sustained pregnancy loss may be monitored weekly for hypoluteoidism, which is a poorly documented condition.",

A progesterone level above 2 ng/ml is required for the maintenance of pregnancy in the bitch. If the progesterone drops to 10 ng/ml, frequent monitoring of the progesterone levels is recommended. Progesterone values of 5 ng/ml may warrant intervention with an exogenous progestogen supplementation. Exogenous progestogen administration is an extralabel use of any of the available preparations and should always be accompanied by careful client education and a signed release form outlining the risks.

When presented, the queen should have a complete physical examination, including baseline laboratory work, and a fecal examination should be performed. Serology for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) should be obtained. Only queens testing negative for these two viruses should be used for breeding. Neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs in purebred cats. This condition may be avoided by blood typing the queen and breeding to a tom of an appropriate blood type (Box 1-2\n). The blood types of domestic felids are A, B, and AB. The breeds with the highest frequency of type B blood are the British Shorthair, the Devon Rex, and the Cornish Rex. Cats are unusual in that unlike dogs, they have naturally occurring antibodies to other blood types. The A allele (A) is dominant to the B (B) allele so only the cats with homozygous recessive condition (BB) express the type B antigen on their erythrocytes. Type A cats are either homozygous AA or heterozygous AB. The AB blood type is rare and inherited separately as a third allele recessive to A and co-dominant with B. Feline neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs when maternal anti-A alloantibody gains access to the fetal circulation after colostrum ingestion and destroys type A and type AB erythrocytes. Type A and type AB kittens from a type B queen bred to a type A or AB tom are at risk.

Progesterone produced by the corpus luteum is necessary for maintenance of pregnancy in the cat since placental production of progesterone is minor. The corpora lutea remains functional throughout pregnancy and regresses after delivery. The queen typically has a progesterone level of 1.0 to 1.6 ng/ml at day 60 of pregnancy. Thus pregnancy likely involves pregnancy-specific secretion of luteotrophic hormones of placental or pituitary origin. Several studies indicate that prolactin is a major luteotrophic factor in pregnant queens after implantation has occurred. Hypoluteoidism has not been reported in the queen. Progesterone therapy to prevent recurrent pregnancy loss should only be considered when infectious causes of pregnancy loss in the queen have been ruled out.",

Teratology is the science of studying the etiology of birth defects. There are three critical periods in the development of the fetus. The first period is preimplantation (pregastrulation), which occurs from fertilization to implantation. The second is the embryonic period, which is when organogenesis occurs, and is an important period when birth defects develop. The third is the fetal period, which roughly encompasses the last 3 weeks of pregnancy, during which growth and maturation of organ systems occur. Serious insult during the preimplantation phase may result in an all-or-none phenomenon in which implantation does not occur or the cells survive and continue development. Most serious defects occur during the embryonic period (days 22 to 44 from the LH surge) in the dog. During the fetal stage, gross structural defects seldom occur except in structures undergoing rapid growth and maturation such as the palate, the cerebellum, and parts of the cardiovascular and urogenital system.",

Ultrasonography in the bitch is accurate for pregnancy diagnosis in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer using quality equipment as early as 19 to 21 days post-LH peak in the bitch. When the LH peak is known, pregnancy diagnosis in the bitch is very accurate after days 21 to 23. If the LH peak is unknown, ultrasonography for pregnancy detection should be performed at approximately 30 days after the last known breeding (see Figure 1-4). Fetal heartbeats are first detected 23 to 25 days after the LH peak or 16 days after the onset of cytologic diestrus. In addition to pregnancy diagnosis, ultrasonography can be used to identify fetal loss. This author has observed disparity between the sizes of gestational sacs in some pregnancies. This size disparity appears to be accompanied by low volume of embryonic fluid, cessation of fetal heart beat in the smaller sacs, shrinkage, and ultimately resorption. Ultrasound has not been proved reliable for determination of litter size. Determination of fetal age involves multiple measurements of the biparietal or trunk diameter and must take into consideration differences relative to breed and litter size.",

Progesterone levels, however, can be used to confirm ovulation failure. In the queen, progesterone levels may be used 40 days after breeding to differentiate pseudopregnancy from pregnancy. In the pseudopregnant queen, progesterone declines to baseline levels by day 40 after breeding but remains at 1 ng/ml or above in pregnant queens. Prolactin levels increase in both the pregnant bitch and the pregnant queen; however, a commercial test is not available. Relaxin is the only reported hormone that is pregnancy-specific in carnivores and is produced by the fetoplacental unit. Relaxin is best measured by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. An in-clinic test (ReproCHEK, Synbiotics; www.synbiotics.com) has been developed but is not as reliable as ultrasonography.",

Radiography will also allow the assessment of the fetal skeleton for signs of fetal death (i.e., collapse of the fetal skeleton or gas within the uterus). Radiography does not truly assess the presentation of the fetus because of the mobility of the uterine horns. Ultrasonography is a better diagnostic tool for the assessment of fetal health since it allows examination of the fetal heart rate, the amount of allantoic fluid, fetal movement, and some fetal abnormalities such as abdominal wall defects (Figure 1-7\n). Fetal heart rates that are below 130 beats per minute indicate poor puppy viability, and the pregnancy requires intensive monitoring. Normal fetal heart rates at term are often greater than 200 beats per minute.",

            "text": "During the prenatal visit, it is prudent to evaluate the dam's blood glucose and serum calcium (ionized calcium preferred) levels and packed cell volume. The physical examination should include a digital vaginal examination to detect any soft tissue obstructions (stricture or masses) and to evaluate the vaginal area for excessive edema. Any vaginal discharge warrants vaginoscopy, using either a human sigmoidoscope (Figure 1-8\n) or a rigid endoscope (Figure 1-9\n) with a video monitor to assess cervical patency and the presence of fetal membranes. The client should be given verbal and written instructions on the management of parturition and should be encouraged to inform the clinician of any change in rectal temperature (Boxes 1-7\nand 1-8\n). The bitch's temperature commonly drops to below 99\u00b0 F (37.2\u00b0 C) within 24 hours of initiation of parturition. The queen may experience a similar decrease in rectal temperature, although it is seldom reported by the owner. The temperature drop follows the decrease in progesterone at the end of pregnancy. During late pregnancy, the pattern of uterine electrical activity changes, which correlates with the decrease in plasma progesterone. This suggests that progesterone plays an important role in the process of parturition in the bitch. The client should be counseled to seek veterinary attention if labor is not initiated within 24 hours of the decrease in rectal temperature. The client should be given after-hours contact information if the clinician will be providing after-hours care or contact information for appropriate emergency care.BOX 1-7Complications of whelping\nProlonged gestation>71 days after breeding>65 days after LH peak>57-59 days after diestrusTemperature drop to 99\u00b0 F (37.2\u00b0 C) >24 hours previously\nVaginal dischargeMucoid\u2014normalHemorrhagic\u2014abnormalGreen tinged\u2014abnormalBlack\u2014abnormal\nStage I laborUterine inertiaCollapse of bitchVomiting\nStage II laborStraining continuously for 30 minutes without delivery of a puppy3 hours intermittent contractions before first puppyMore than 3 hours between puppies\n\n\nLH, Luteinizing hormone.BOX 1-8Normal birth in dogs (whelping)Preparations for WhelpingBegin preparations for delivery of puppies before the female gives birth. Provide a whelping box for the mother to begin sleeping in to ensure the puppies are born in the area you have chosen. This box should be only slightly bigger than the mother, with sides 6 to 8 inches high to keep the pups from crawling out of the nest. Place the box in a secluded yet familiar area of the home, away from the family traffic, to allow the mother solitude. Newspapers make excellent bedding because they can be changed easily, are absorbent, and can be shredded by the mother as she makes her \u201cnest.\u201d If materials such as old quilts, blankets, rugs, or towels are used, they must be washed frequently.If you want to know precisely when delivery is near, check the rectal temperature of the mother twice daily from the 58th day of pregnancy until labor begins. Normal rectal temperature is between 100.5\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) and 102\u00b0 F (38.9\u00b0 C). Within 24 hours before the onset of labor, the rectal temperature drops nearly 2 degrees to 99\u00b0 F (37.2\u00b0 C) or below.Labor and DeliveryLabor in the female dog (bitch) can be divided into three stages. The second and third stages are repeated with the birth of each puppy. During the first stage, the mother seems extremely restless and very nervous and often seeks seclusion. She may refuse food even if offered her favorite treats. This stage may last 6 to 24 hours. This is a good time to exercise the mother to allow her to urinate and defecate. In the second stage, uterine contractions and expulsion of the puppies begin. Usually, a small greenish sac of fluid protrudes from the vulva, followed by the puppy and its attached placenta. The normal presentation of the puppy is nose first, stomach down (\u201cdiving\u201d position). About one-third of all puppies, however, are born hindquarters first. This presentation is considered normal in the dog. After delivery, the mother opens the sac, cleans off the pup, and severs the umbilical cord. You may have to perform these functions for the mother (see Obstetric Care). Make sure the sac is removed from the puppy immediately if it is unbroken during delivery. The third stage of labor is the resting stage, which follows delivery of each puppy. Mild contractions and delivery of the afterbirth occur in this phase. This stage usually lasts 10 to 30 minutes, but it may range from a few seconds to an hour.Obstetric CareAfter a pup is delivered, remove all membranes covering the puppy, clean the face, and remove mucus from the mouth and nose. Rub the puppy with a clean towel to dry it and to stimulate respiration and circulation. After a few minutes of rubbing, the puppy should begin to squirm and cry loudly. The umbilical cord should be tied about an inch from the puppy's body with fine thread and then cut on the side of the knot away from the puppy. Apply a drop of Betadine to the cord end after it is cut.Assisting with the BirthIf a puppy seems to be lodged in the birth canal and the mother cannot expel it, rapid assistance is necessary. There may not be time to call the veterinarian and drive to the hospital. Grasp the puppy with a clean towel and exert steady, firm traction. Do not jerk or pull suddenly. Traction may have to be applied for as long as 5 minutes. If you cannot remove the puppy, call the doctor.Notify the Doctor if any of the Following Occur\n\u2022A puppy is lodged in the birth canal and cannot be removed.\u2022There is strong, persistent labor for 30 minutes without delivery of a pup.\u2022There is weak, intermittent labor for 3 hours without delivery of any puppies.\u2022It has been more than 3 hours since the delivery of the last pup, and it is probable that more puppies are still inside.\u2022There is a greenish-black vaginal discharge and no labor or puppies within 3 to 4 hours. The greenish-black color is normal, but the discharge should be followed very soon by delivery of the pups.\u2022The pregnancy lasts more than 65 days.\u2022It has been 24 hours since the drop in rectal temperature and there are no signs of labor.\n",
