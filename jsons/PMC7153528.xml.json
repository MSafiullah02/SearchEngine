            "text": "China was the first country that identified the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as the cause of the outbreak. On January 23, Chinese authorities imposed lockdown measures on ten cities in an unprecedented effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 (Mahase, 2020) and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-, 2020) Subsequently, rapid surge in the number of COVID-19 cases was observed during March 2020 in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Europe and United States. (WHO team arrives in Iran; COVID-19 surges in Korea, Italy. Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2020, Europe on Lockdown From COVID-19. Jewish Journal, 2020) Increasing menace of the epidemic led to a global atmosphere of anxiety and depression due to disrupted travel plans, social isolation, media information overload and panic buying of necessity goods. (Ho et al., 2020) A recent study in China found that the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses. (Li et al., 2020) As a result, governments and public health authorities urgently need guidance and actionable information on effective public health and psychological interventions that can safeguard the mental health of the general public. (Rubin et al., 2020) Recent mental health studies on COVID-19 were cross-sectional (Wang et al., 2020), focusing on health professionals (Kang et al., 2020, Tan et al., 2020, Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) or a particular age group (Cao et al., 2020) and lack of in-depth analysis to identify risk or protective factors for mental health. (Qiu et al., 2020) Currently, there is no known information about the longitudinal change of mental health status throughout the COVID-19 epidemic and factors that would influence psychological impact and mental health status with the implementation of public health measures of such unprecedented magnitude. The novelty of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the temporal psychological impact and adverse mental health status during the initial outbreak and peak of COVID-19 epidemic and identity risk and protective factors among the general population in China.",

(Wang et al., 2020) The National University of Singapore COVID-19 questionnaire consisted of questions related to (1) demographic data; (2) physical symptoms during past 14 days; (3) contact history with a COVID-19 patient in past 14 days; (4) knowledge and concerns about COVID-19 and (5) precautionary measures against COVID-19 in the past 14 days. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). (Christianson and Marren, 2012) IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. (Hosey et al., 2019) The mental health status of respondents was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) (Norton, 2007). DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. (Zanon et al., 2020) IES-R and DASS were previously used in research related to the COVID-19 epidemic.

Nevertheless, prolonged lockdown had several adverse impacts on mental health, especially among the second- survey respondents aged 12-21\u00b74 years who demonstrated a higher psychological impact of COVID-19. This age group mainly comprised of students who were affected by prolonged school closure, requiring online education support and uncertainty about examinations and matriculation arrangements. Respondents from both surveys who were parents with children younger than 16 years of age were not associated with higher IES-R or DASS-21 scores.

COVID-19 can cause acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 from the respiratory tract. (Conti et al., 2020) These cytokines were commonly found to be increased in major depressive disorder (Liu et al., 2012, Ng et al., 2018) and functional somatic syndromes (Viljoen and Panzer, 2005). COVID-19, depression and functional somatic syndrome share the same PNI framework. Antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine) was found to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines by attenuating the behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of immune activation. (Lu et al., 2017) Further research is required to study the effectiveness of antidepressants as part of the anti-inflammatory strategies against COVID-19 by reducing depression and somatic symptoms.",

            "text": "Our study highlights some public health implications. First, the strong association between physical symptoms and the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak supports importance of developing a rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 with widespread availability to alleviate the psychological impact and psychiatric symptoms experienced by general population. Second, providing proper and repeated, yet simple, health education via the Internet and media is important for inculcating good hygiene practices. We observed that significantly higher proportion (10\u00b78%) of the second-survey respondents did not know that COVID-19 could be transmitted by droplets, which might reduce the acceptability of certain precautionary measures. Third, the dissemination of health information via radio was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression in both surveys. This observation may help the Governments and health authorities worldwide to modify the current methods of increasing public awareness. Perhaps, increased use of television (with participation by celebrities) and Internet (for detailed information with visual graphics and videos) to disseminate important health information might be more effective methods to change knowledge, attitude and practices among the general public. Fourth, mask-wearing, as a prevention method to reduce pathogen exposure (Kim and Su, 2020); was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. Perhaps, this led to significantly higher face-mask use by second-survey respondents, regardless of the presence of symptoms. This is an interesting and important phenomenon due to the divided scientific opinion on protective effects of usual face masks (Tan W HF, McIntyre RS, Jiang L, Jiang X, Zhang L, Zhao X, Zou Y, Hu Y, Luo X, Zhang Z, . Returning to Work during the Coronavirus Disease, 2019) (Feng et al., 2020), coupled with their scarce availability. Efforts are needed to impart an unbiased and clear guidelines on the use of face masks and their types to allay the fears, confusions and sense of inferiority (for people with no access to the masks) among general population. Fifth, about one-third of respondents experienced social discrimination due to the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result, the WHO and governments from all countries should minimize the possibility of discrimination against certain groups of people regarding the origin of COVID-19. Lastly, ensuring the availability of essential services and commodities as well as financial security are essential to prevent psychological impact of the current pandemic. Governments worldwide need to take discrete and transparent efforts to win the confidence of general public and ensure optimal mental health and avoid psychological reflexes like panic buying.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face psychotherapy is not feasible due to strict quarantine and lockdown measures. Mental health providers need to consider adopting online psychotherapy. Pre-implementation training of mental health professionals with involvement of multiple relevant agencies may help in various psychological interventions targeting PTSD symptoms. One example of evidence-based treatment is trauma-focused -cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT). (Cao et al., 2020) TF-CBT can be modified for the COVID-19 pandemic with emphasis on 1) education on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) development of psychosocial skills to optimize emotional and behavioral adjustment during quarantine and lockdown; 3) affective expression and problem-solving to handle emotions and common problems (e.g., shortage of necessities) encountered during quarantine and lockdown; 4) cognitive formulation to illustrate the relationships among thoughts, feelings and behaviors; 5) cognitive challenge or modification of unhelpful thoughts about COVID-19 and perceived discrimination; 5) trauma narration, in which public describe their personal traumatic experiences during COVID-19 pandemic; 6) home-based relaxation techniques and stress management skills with online guidance; 7) grief therapy to handle potential loss of family members or friends who died of COVID-19; 8) online peer support group session to talk to one other about their trauma; 9) enhancing safety and precaution to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 and10) exposure to trauma reminders to overcome avoidance of situations that are no longer risky when the COVID pandemic is over.

Although the anonymity of the questionnaire made this sampling unavoidable, 333 respondents completed both the first and second surveys. However, owing to the anonymous nature of the data collection, we could not pair respondents at the 2- time intervals. Another limitation is due to the self-reporting of the levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress, which may not always be aligned with objective assessment by mental health professionals. Nevertheless, psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress are based on personal feelings, and self-reporting was paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tan W HF, McIntyre RS, Jiang L, Jiang X, Zhang L, Zhao X, Zou Y, Hu Y, Luo X, Zhang Z, . Returning to Work during the Coronavirus Disease, 2019) In the same vein, we could not rule out the possibility that some of the respondents might have been infected with COVID-19. There were only 0.9% of the first-survey respondents and 0.5% of second-survey respondents who received testing on COVID-19. Due to low prevalence of testing, the number of respondents who were tested positive for COVID-19 was even lesser. Nevertheless, we could not rule out the possibility that some respondents were asymptomatic carriers with mild COVID-19 symptoms.

There were no significant temporal changes in the levels of stress, anxiety and depression between the first and second surveys. We identified the specific target groups (young and students) prone for the psychological impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as various factors that might help in safeguarding the mental health of general population. Various Governments should focus on effective methods of dissemination of unbiased knowledge about the disease, teaching correct methods for containment, ensure availability of essential services and commodities, provide sufficient financial support for the present and future in order to win the current war against COVID-19.",
