But arising vulnerabilities could be an open door to malicious attacks. Necessity for security protection on airborne systems has been officially recognized and new standards are actually under construction. In order to provide development assurance and countermeasures effectiveness evidence to certification authorities, security objectives and specifications must be clearly identified thanks to a security risk assessment process. This paper gives main characteristics for a security risk assessment methodology to be integrated in the early design of airborne systems development and compliant with airworthiness security standards.",

            "text": "The increasing complexity of aircraft networked systems exposes them to three adverse effects likely to erode flight safety margins: intrinsic component failures, design or development errors and misuse. Safety 1 processes have been capitalizing on experience to counter such effects and standards were issued to provide guidelines for safety assessment process and development assurance such as ARP-4754 [1] , ARP-4761 [2] , DO-178B [3] and DO-254 [4] . But safety-critical systems segregation from the Open World tends to become thinner due to the high integration level of airborne networks: use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf equipments (COTS), Internet access for passengers as part of the new In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) services, transition from Line Replaceable Units to field loadable software, evolution from voice-ground-based to datalink satellite-based communications, more autonomous navigation with e-Enabled aircrafts, etc. Most of the challenging innovations to offer new services, ease air traffic management, reduce development and maintenance time and costs, are not security-compatible. They add a fourth adverse effect, increasingly worrying certification authorities: vulnerability to deliberate or accidental attacks (e.g. worms or viruses propagation, loading of corrupted software, unauthorized access to aircraft system interfaces, on-board systems denial of service). De Cerchio and Riley quote in [5] a short list of registered cyber security incidents in the aviation domain. As a matter of fact, EUROCAE 2 and RTCA 3 are defining new airworthiness security standards: ED-202 [6] provides guidance to achieve security compliance objectives based on future ED-203 4 [7] methods. EU and US 5 certification authorities are addressing requests to aircraft manufacturers so they start dealing with security issues. However, ED-203 has not been officially issued and existing risk assessment methods are not directly applicable to the aeronautical context: stakes and scales are not adapted, they are often qualitative and depend on security managers expertise. Also, an important stake in aeronautics is costs minimization. On the one hand, if security is handled after systems have been implemented, modifications to insert security countermeasures, re-development and recertification costs are overwhelming: \"fail-first patch-later\" [8] IT security policies are not compatible with aeronautic constraints. It is compulsory that risk assessment is introduced at an early design step of development process. On the other hand, security over-design must be avoided to reduce unnecessary development costs: risk needs to be quantified in order to rank what has to be protected in priority.",

This methodology is in strong interaction with safety and development processes. Its main advantage is to allow the identification of risks at an early design step of development V-cycle so that countermeasures are consistently specified before systems implementation.

            "text": "Many risk assessment methodologies aim at providing tools to comply with ISO security norms such as: ISO/IEC:27000, 31000, 17799, 13335, 15443, 7498, 73 and 15408 (Common Criteria [9] ). For example, MAGERIT [10] and CRAMM [11] deal with governmental risk management of IT against for example privacy violation. NIST800-30 [12] provides security management steps to fit into the system development life-cycle of IT devices. Others, such as OCTAVE [13] aim at ensuring enterprise security by evaluating risk to avoid financial losses and brand reputation damage. Previously stated methods are qualitative, i.e. no scale is given to compare identified risks between them. MEHARI [14] proposes a set of checklists and evaluation grids to estimate natural exposure levels and impact on business. Finally, EBIOS [15] shows an interesting evaluation of risks through the quantitative characterization of a wide spectrum of threat sources (from espionage to natural disasters) but scales of proposed attributes do not suit to the aeronautic domain. Risk is commonly defined as the product of three factors: Risk = Threat \u00d7 Vulnerability \u00d7 Consequence. Quantitative risk estimations combine these factors with more or less sophisticated models (e.g. a probabilistic method of risk prediction based on fuzzy logic and Petri Nets [16] vs. a visual representation of threats under a pyramidal form [17] ). Ortalo, Deswarte and Kaaniche [18] defined a mathematical model based on Markovian chains to define METF (Mean Effort to security Failure), a security equivalent of MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure). Contrary to the failure rate used in safety, determined by experience feedback and fatigue testing on components, security parameters are not physically measurable. To avoid subjective analysis, Mahmoud, Larrieu and Pirovano [19] developed an interesting quantitative algorithm based on computation of risk propagation through each node of a network. Some of the parameters necessary for risk level determination are computed by using network vulnerability scanning. This method is useful for an a posteriori evaluation, but it is not adapted to an early design process as the system must have been implemented or at least emulated.",
