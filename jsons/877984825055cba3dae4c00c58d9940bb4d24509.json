A large body of theoretical work has been devoted to modeling disease emergence, and critical factors that predict outbreak occurrence and severity have been proposed. In this chapter, we focus on biological factors that underlie both theoretical models and urban planning. We describe the SARS 2002-2003 pandemic as a case study of epidemic control of a human infectious disease. We then describe theoretical analyses of disease dynamics and control strategies. An important conclusion is that epidemic control will be strongly dependent on particular aspects of pathogen biology including host breadth, virulence, incubation time, and/or mutation rate. The probability, and potential cost, of future outbreaks, may be high and lessons from both past cases and theoretical work should inform urban design and policy.

The lethality of the 1918 strain was high and showed an unusual relationship between lethality and patients' age: 50 % of deaths were in the 20-40 age group which is the opposite pattern for milder flu strains (higher mortality among the very young and the aged). This partly reflected the impact of WWI where contagion was passed among troops both in training facilities as well as during warfare. However, the strain also had an unusual and lethal property; virulence was enhanced by a human immune over-reaction called a \"cytokine storm\" which causes the lungs to fill with liquid. Some important aspects of the epidemic were: a deadly pathogen arose from a jump from animal to human (close between-species interactions were important in the origin of the virus), a few mutations were sufficient to confer strong lethality for the virus, and human travel allowed rapid spread (close quarters and massive troop movements helped to spread the virus and allowed new mutations to spread quickly).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 225, "text": "(Taubenberger and Morens 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemics and Human History"}, {"text": "This chapter will focus on biological factors that are relevant for understanding and controlling epidemics.

For example, water-borne diseases, such as cholera, can rapidly spread throughout the community when the supply of drinking water becomes contaminated with the pathogen Vibrio cholerae through poor sanitation or hygiene practices. Food-borne infections follow a similar transmission pattern to water-borne diseases. Transmission through contaminated food and water is also known as \"fecal-oral transmission\" because fecal matter is often the source of contamination while oral ingestion is the primary route for infection (Mount Sinai Hospital 2007) . Diseases transmitted by an animal vector, such as bubonic plague, are also considered long-range infections because a vector facilitates the spreading of the pathogen and direct contact is not necessary. One interesting aspect of some vector-borne infections is that direct contact with an infected individual cannot transmit the infection without the help of the vector. For example, Dengue fever, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, can only be transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014). In contrast, plague, caused by bacteria living in fleas of rodents, is primarily transmitted through flea bites, but contact with contaminated body fluids like blood can also lead to plague bacterial infection (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015a).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 737, "end": 764, "text": "(Mount Sinai Hospital 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 112, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Pathogens and Transmission Mechanisms"}, {"text": "In general, fecal-oral and vector-borne diseases are infections transmitted through an environmental (water, food) or a biological (animal) carrier that extends transmission range to large distances, but other routes are also possible depending on the specific pathogen.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogens and Transmission Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Compared to long-range diseases, \"short-range\" infectious diseases are infections that transmit over limited distances and may require close or direct physical contact with an infectious individual. Examples of short-range infections are pathogens that infect via contaminated airborne particles or expectorated droplets, and diseases that require contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or semen. Infections capable of airborne transmission have the widest range among short-range infections and are caused by pathogens that spread through minute solid or liquid particles suspended in the air for an extended period of time (Mount Sinai Hospital 2007) . In addition, the pathogen must be resistant to desiccation to remain viable for long periods of time outside its host. Respiratory diseases are commonly believed to spread via airborne transmission of contaminated particles expectorated from coughing and sneezing. However, many respiratory pathogens do not have the capacity to withstand dry environments. Instead, these pathogens transmit via \"droplets\"-expectorated moisture particles that are too big to indefinitely remain suspended in the air-to ensure ample moisture while outside the host. Transmission occurs when contaminated droplets from an infected individual come in contact with surfaces of the eye, nose, or mouth. This mode of transmission is called \"droplet contact\". Although diseases spreading via droplet contact have a more limited range than truly airborne infections, in the later sections, we will show how environmental factors can extend the range of droplet transmission. Finally, diseases that transmit via direct contact generally have the most limited transmission range and some have stringent requirements for transmission. In the case of Ebola, the disease is transmissible only via direct exposure of broken skin or mucous membranes with contaminated body fluids like blood, urine and semen, and excretions such as vomit and feces (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015c). Sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS are a special form of direct contact infection that requires sexual intercourse or sharing contaminated needles for exposure (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015b). Thus, short-range infections are characterized by some dependence on distance for infection and can be transmitted directly without a carrier.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 635, "end": 662, "text": "(Mount Sinai Hospital 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogens and Transmission Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Distinguishing between these two classes is important because measures to alleviate and control the spread of long-range infections are not applicable for short-range cases and vice versa. For instance, targeting the carrier or vector of the disease to control the spread of long-range infections (e.g., decontaminating or blocking off access to contaminated water or food) and reducing exposure to vectors of the disease, are irrelevant for mitigating the spread of short-range infections. In contrast, measures to control short-range diseases such as limiting person-to-person contact and imposing quarantine procedures do little to help alleviate the spread of water-borne or vector-borne illnesses.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 8000 worldwide SARS cases and over 770 deaths occurred in 30 different countries, mostly over a period of about four months (Kamps and Hoffmann 2003) . The severe, \"atypical\" pneumonia originated in Guangdong Province in southern China in mid-November 2002. Most of the early cases appear to have occurred among those who kill and sell animals and meat as well as food preparers and servers (Breiman et al. 2003) . By mid to late January 2003, the disease began to spread rapidly within the province, but a combination of symptoms difficult to distinguish from pneumonia (fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, coughing) and government policy to discourage coverage delayed the reporting of the epidemic until February 11. The initial communication reported 305 cases (including >100 healthcare workers) and 5 mortalities, but claimed that the epidemic was under control (Enserink 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 539, "text": "(Kamps and Hoffmann 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 781, "end": 802, "text": "(Breiman et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1272, "text": "(Enserink 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The 2002-2003 SARS Outbreak: A Modern Urban Epidemic"}, {"text": "The role of \"superspreaders\" and amplification in hospitals remained characteristics of SARS as it spread to a worldwide epidemic. The first of several superspreading (generally defined as ten or more transmissions from a single infected individual) events occurred in Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 (Braden et al. 2013 ). The index case was a physician from Guangdong who stayed at the Hotel Metropole. The physician had treated SARS patients in Guangdong (although the disease was still unrecognized) and showed symptoms before his trip. He stayed only one night at the hotel before being hospitalized with severe symptoms but the short stay was sufficient to spread the infection to 13 or more of the guests from the same floor of the hotel as well as a Hong Kong resident who visited one of the guests. Eventually, over 4000 (almost half) of the documented 2003 SARS cases could be traced to this \"index\" case. Remarkably, there was no known direct contact in most of the transmissions among the hotel guests and visitors. The Hong Kong resident who visited a friend in the hotel subsequently infected over 140 others at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. Others were business/holiday travelers who spread the pathogen to Canada, Vietnam, and Singapore.

The etiological agent of SARS was later discovered to be a novel coronavirus and was named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This discovery, in late March 2003, came as a surprise to disease experts as previous human coronaviruses were only known to cause mild illness. In animals, related viruses were known to cause fatal respiratory as well as neurological diseases but coronaviruses are usually highly species-specific (Kamps and Hoffmann 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 746, "end": 771, "text": "(Kamps and Hoffmann 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The 2002-2003 SARS Outbreak: A Modern Urban Epidemic"}, {"text": "Forensic analysis of the Metropole Hotel in late April 2003 revealed physical components of SARS in the common areas of the 9th floor including the corridor and elevator hall. However, no bacteria were found inside the guest rooms of the infected guests (the ventilation systems employed positive pressure within the guest rooms so that air was not shared among rooms). Respiratory droplets, or suspended small particle aerosols generated by the index case-patient, are the most likely transmission mechanism (Braden et al. 2013) . SARS and other respiratory infections are considered to undergo short-range (approximately 1 m) transmission via pathogen-infected droplets from host coughing or sneezing. Such transmission requires \"close contact\", physical proximity between infected and susceptible individuals who can be infected when large droplets spray enter their bodies via air or touch. However, minute droplets or even solid residues that can arise via evaporation (droplet nuclei) may allow potential indirect and/or long-range transmission (Bourouiba et al. 2014) . For example, contaminated gas clouds that form during coughing/sneezing may have carried the pathogen and extended its transmission range, removing the distinction between droplet contact and airborne modes of transmission. Aerosol transmission probably caused high infection rates in an airline flight (Air China 112) from Hong Kong to Beijing in which a single 73-year old individual infected at least 20 others (Olsen et al. 2003) . This feature of the disease may be highly relevant for medical and urban policy. Long-range aerosol/nuclei transmission does not require direct contact between infected and uninfected individuals and can greatly elevate the number of \"contacts\" for a given infected individual.

The index case carried a high viral load and suffered from diarrhea.

However, population-based summary statistics may obscure individual variation of infectiousness and other types of heterogeneities. Woolhouse et al.

The authors first estimated the distribution of the parameter R, which expresses the number of new infections from an infected host. Probabilities of outbreak (persistence of initially introduced pathogen lineages) were determined for R distributions with a fixed mean but differing in variance. The authors found that large variance in R distribution greatly decreased the probability of outbreak (Fig. 1) .

In the first network, termed \"urban\", many individuals have numerous contacts at public places including schools, hospitals, shopping centers and workplaces, and have more limited numbers of contacts at their home. The second network was a power law network, in which the distribution of the number of connections has a long right-hand tail. In such a distribution, a small fraction of people have large numbers of connections but most people have only a few connections. The third network was a Poisson network, in which the majority of the people have numbers of connections close to the mean number. If the existence of superspreaders increases the probability of outbreak, then power law networks should show the highest outbreak probability. However, similar to Lipsitch et al.

The reason might be similar to what we discussed above; in a power law network, the numbers of individuals with extremely small numbers of connection are elevated compared with the other two networks.

However, by the time the rate decreases to R < 1, a large proportion of the population has already been infected with the disease.

Low virulence allows infected host individuals to survive, and pathogens can have more chance to spread to other host individuals. If pathogens have high virulence, they can propagate within an infected host individual, but risk killing the infected host and limiting their spread to other hosts. Trade-offs between reproduction within a host and transmission among hosts is a well-studied explanation for the evolution of reduced virulence (Anderson and May 1982; Alizon et al. 2009 ). However, the balance (or equilibrium) of this trade-off can differ depending on biological characters of pathogens. Ewald (1993) discussed how transmission mechanisms of pathogens can alter the predicted trajectory of virulence evolution. Highly virulent diseases tend to immobilize hosts in early stage of infection. Therefore, if pathogens are mainly transmitted by contacts between hosts, higher virulence would greatly decrease chances of new transmission. However, if pathogens can survive outside of the host and can be transmitted by air, water or vectors in which they are not virulent, host immobility should have less effect on the chances of new transmission. Ewald (1993) noted that such pathogens, such as smallpox, tuberculosis or diphtheria, are often more virulent than pathogens that depend more directly on hosts for transmission. Other factors can affect the balance of the trade-off and allow evolution of high virulence (Galvani 2003) . For example, if multiple pathogen strains infect simultaneously and compete within individual hosts, high reproduction rate within a host (leading to high virulence) may be favored. In sexually-transmitted diseases, frequent exchange of sexual partners makes transmission of pathogens between hosts easier and as a result cause high virulence.

Because urban planning and design can create or alter population structure by its use of the the environment, in the following paragraphs, we introduce two studies focused on the effect of host population structure on evolution of virulence. These studies are based on relatively simple models that may yield general insights. Boots and Sasaki (1999) incorporated a grid-like spatial structure of \"sites\" at which individuals can exist. Each site can have one of three states: empty, occupied by susceptible individual, or occupied by infected individual. In the spatial structure, connections between individuals were divided into two types, those between neighbors and those between randomly chosen individuals. Randomly chosen individuals can be in distant sites, and in such cases, pathogens can be transferred to distant locations. They found that pathogen virulence is favored as contact between hosts living in distant places becomes more common. In this model, a site becomes empty after death of an occupant. Therefore, higher virulence is more likely to create a situation in which pathogens kill all susceptible hosts around them and can no longer spread. However, long-distance transfer allows pathogens to spread to new locations where they are surrounded by susceptible hosts. Long distance transportation in human society allows contact between distant individuals and may be an important factor that facilitates the spread of outbreaks and favors pathogen virulence. Boots and Sasaki (1999) did not consider host immunity in their model. Immune (infection-resistant) hosts can block pathogen spread and may have a large impact on the evolution of virulence. This question was theoretically addressed by the same authors. Boots et al. (2004) incorporated the immune state after the recovery assuming a negative correlation between recovery rate and virulence and found that evolutionary trajectories could lead to low, or even extremely high, virulence depending on host population density. In host populations with high density, pathogens can easily find susceptible hosts and therefore, low virulence which increases the opportunity of infection to a new host evolves. On the other hand, in host populations with low density, immune hosts around a newly infected host efficiently block pathogen spread. In this case, highly lethal pathogens which kill infected hosts and make open spaces can spread more efficiently compared with pathogens with low virulence which induce immunity in hosts. Even after killing some hosts, pathogens still have a chance to spread by infecting new susceptible hosts that emigrate to the open spaces. In Boots and Sasaki (1999) , infected hosts are assumed to be susceptible just after they recover and therefore, lower virulence pathogens spread more efficiently. However, in Boots et al.

All the diseases they surveyed appeared to have originated from the Old World (Africa, Asia, Europe) and a remarkable proportion of causative pathogens arose from warm-blooded vertebrates while the remaining were attributed to birds. Interestingly, the purported geographical origin of the disease was correlated with the type of animal to which the pathogen originally infected. For example, many diseases that trace back to tropical regions have come from wild non-human primates whereas diseases attributed to temperate regions often emerged from domestic animals. Although the exact reason for this pattern is unknown, Wolfe et al. (2007) suggested that, because livestock and pets were domesticated in the Old World, ancestral pathogens had more opportunity to infect humans compared to more recently domesticated New World animals.

During their long evolutionary history, pathogens and their original hosts may have been recurrently co-evolving by which hosts evolve to be resistant against the pathogens, and pathogens evolve to evade the resistant system (Little 2002; Woolhouse et al. 2002) . This means if hosts are exposed to a novel pathogen, it is highly possible that the hosts do not yet have immune resistance against the pathogen and are affected by high virulence (Longdon et al. 2015) . There are also cases in which infections of novel pathogens cause inappropriate immune response and as a result, increase their virulence (Graham and Baric 2010). As introduced above, these highly virulent pathogens can spread in a host population depending on host spatial structure. However, it is important to note that not all novel pathogens have high virulence for human. Highly virulent pathogens are more likely to be detected and studied and therefore, the patterns may result from ascertainment bias (Alizon et al. 2009; Longdon et al. 2015) .

The search for the animal reservoir of the SARS pathogen first identified the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) after SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) were isolated from civets in live-animal markets in Guangdong, China (Guan et al. 2003) . However, Tu et al. (2004) showed that while civets in live-animal markets were infected with SL-CoVs, civets on farms did not possess antibodies against the virus, which indicated that they have never been exposed to the pathogen. Moreover, palm civets infected with SARS-CoV showed signs of illness contrary to the expectation that animal reservoirs should be clinically asymptomatic (Calisher et al. 2006) . This observation and that other animals in the same live-animal markets were also infected by the virus (Guan et al. 2003) indicated that the palm civets were infected in live-animal markets rather than being the ultimate source of the pathogen. Surveillance of wild animals in the region later lead to the serendipitous discovery that Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) are the original animal host of the coronavirus that became SARS-CoV (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005b) . The focus on bats may have been inspired by outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra virus a decade before that were also traced back to these mammals (Normile 2013 ). In addition, Li et al. (2005b) stated that the use of bat products in food and traditional medicine in southern China led them to investigate bats as a potential reservoir. Interestingly, bats appear to harbor many human pathogens and have been implicated as the animal reservoir of Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV. Even MERS-CoV, initially transmitted from camels, have been traced back to bat through phylogenetic analysis and biochemical studies (Wang et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014) . While SARS-CoV infection primarily affected the respiratory system, high concentrations of coronavirus were observed in bat feces and recovery from the small and large intestines indicate that replication is primarily through the excretory system (Drexler et al. 2014) . Lau et al. (2005) speculated that the use of bats in traditional medicine, especially bat feces, may have played a crucial role in the cross-species transmission of the virus.

For example, HIV-1 and -2 seem to have transferred multiple times to humans since 1920 based on phylogenetic analysis, but only after 1970 was there a significant spreading of the infection (Heeney et al. 2006) . One explanation suggests that the limited interactions between humans and primates created a barrier for the transference of the virus and insufficient interhuman encounters of infected cases delayed the rise of the epidemic (Parrish et al. 2008) . To describe this phenomenon, let us model the underlying host contact network as a network of nodes (individuals) and connections (exposure). Assuming a heterogeneously connected network such as human social network and contact networks (Eubank et al. 2004) , we find that the probability of a new infection becoming extinct by chance is very high both because the pathogen may be poorly adapted to transmit in the new host (Parrish et al. 2008; Daszak et al. 2000; Dobson and Foufopoulos 2001) and because cross-species transmission events tend to occur in sparsely connected rural areas (Tibayrenc 2011) . The limited connections inhibit emergence of the disease and only the few that avoid stochastic extinction proceed to produce an epidemic in the host population (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Eubank et al. 2004 ). This may explain why spillover events of animal infections, such as H5N1 avian influenza, fail to take hold in the human population despite the hundreds of human cases and deaths that have been reported (Parrish et al. 2008) . While distribution is skewed towards fewer connections in these networks, it is still possible that the cross-species transmission event occurs at a highly connected portion of the network. Such an outcome will only make it more likely that the infection will take hold to produce an epidemic due to the presence of highly connected hubs that can spread the disease to a disproportionate number of hosts (Rock et al. 2014) . Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) expand this concept to show that any type of individual variance, for example infectiousness, produces the same effect. High individual variance increases the probability of extinction of an invading disease regardless of the strength of mean infectiousness. When the host population has a highly heterogeneously connected network, emergence of disease may be rare, but infections that survive stochastic extinction produce \"explosive\" epidemics similar to the case of SARS in 2002.

To infect a host, a virus must be able to interact with the host's cellular receptors to gain entry into cells and hijack the cell's machinery to replicate itself. At the same time, the pathogen must survive against the host's defense mechanisms. The initial interaction between the virus and host receptors is a critical step that determines host specificity and host range. For example, in SARS as well as in other coronaviruses, the viral structure responsible for viral entry is the spike glycoprotein, which also appears to be the key determinant of host specificity (Graham and Baric 2010) . In humans, the receptor-binding domain on the spike glycoprotein interacts with a cell surface metalloproteinase called human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 to gain entry and infect lung epithelial cells (Li et al. 2003) . However, Ren et al. (2008) showed that SL-CoVs found in bats do not interact with palm civet or human ACE2 receptors implying that changes must have occurred to gain this new interaction. In fact, there appears to be a sizeable difference between coronaviruses isolated from the putative bat reservoir and SARS. SL-CoVs from bats were found to be at most only 92 % similar compared to SARS-CoV (Li et al. 2005b) . Later, Ge et al.

Further genetic and biophysical studies demonstrated that two amino acid changes had an enormous effect on the binding affinity of the SARS spike protein to human lung epithelial cells (Li et al. 2005a, c; Qu et al. 2005) . In most palm civet samples, lysine at position 479 and serine at position 487 of the spike protein were observed whereas asparagine and threonine were present in human samples. Li et al.

Although the structural changes appear to be subtle, these substitutions caused a thousand-fold increase in binding affinity to the human ACE2 and lead to enhanced human transmission. However, Li et al. (2005a) also found that some civet specimens have asparagine instead of lysine at position 479 yet this did not affect binding to the civet ACE2 receptor.

When a virus successfully infects a cell, cytoplasmic enzymes that detect the production of double-stranded RNA, a hallmark of virus replication, activate the expression and release of interferons from the cell. Interferons act as an early-warning signal to other cells nearby by activating their intracellular antiviral response to combat viral infection and replication (Roy and Mocarski 2007) . Because of the importance of this immune response against viral infection, many viruses have evolved features to subvert interferon signaling. For example, the influenza virus prevents the infected cell from detecting viral replication by using its NS1 protein to sequester double-stranded viral RNA (Lu et al. 1995) . Another method to interfere with the innate immune response is to prevent interferons from activating antiviral mechanisms. Nipah virus produces two proteins that prevent STAT1 from translocating into the nucleus as well as another protein that sequesters STAT1 present in the nucleus, obstructing the activation of interferon-stimulated genes (Shaw et al. 2004 ). In the case of SARS, Kopecky-Bromberg et al. (2007) found that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and accessory proteins inhibit both the expression of interferon and associated transcription factors, as well as inhibiting cellular response to interferon by subverting the JAK/STAT activation of intracellular antiviral mechanisms. While infection with SARS-CoV did not induce production of interferons, coinfection with another virus did produce interferons. It appears that SARS-CoV does not induce interferon expression, yet does not shut down the whole pathway as interferon signaling continues to work when other stimuli are present (Frieman et al. 2008) . By antagonizing the induction and response to interferons, the pathogen blocks the activation of more than 300 interferon-stimulated genes which prevents the cell from going into an \"antiviral state\" (de Lang et al. 2009 ). Under the antiviral state, inhibitors are activated to prevent cell division, enzymes that digest proteins initiate programmed cell death, and proteins that present viral particles to activate the adaptive immune response are upregulated. Blocking interferon signaling causes a general decrease of both innate and adaptive immune system response, allowing SARS-CoV to infect cells unimpeded and potentially cause a more serious disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 527, "end": 550, "text": "(Roy and Mocarski 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 853, "end": 869, "text": "(Lu et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1233, "text": "(Shaw et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1288, "text": "Kopecky-Bromberg et al.

RNA viruses have an extremely high mutation rate because their RNA polymerase, the enzyme that copies their genome, lacks proofreading activity which leads to error-prone replication. Mutation rates for RNA viruses range from 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22124 substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection, two orders of magnitude higher, on average, than DNA viruses (Sanju\u00e1n et al. 2010 ). At those rates, about 1 out of 100,000 nucleotide changes every time an RNA virus replicates itself. This may not seem high but note that hundreds of millions of viral particles may be produced during a single infection (Haase 1994) , which gives the virus numerous opportunities to explore potentially advantageous mutations. Although high mutation rates helps RNA viruses to rapidly adopt advantageous changes and alter phenotype, deleterious mutations are also produced at an elevated rate. Lauring et al. (2012) have demonstrated that viruses mitigate the effects of deleterious phenotypes by outcompeting and quickly purging these low-fitness variants. The ability of viruses to incorporate functional components made by other functional viruses within the same cell appears to also mitigate the negative effects of high mutation rates (Makino et al. 1988 ). Indeed, studies have shown that raising the mutation rate through mutagens can be used to create large numbers of dysfunctional mutants that rapidly leads to the extinction of the viral population (Pathak and Temin 1992; Loeb et al. 1999; Domingo 2000) . Interestingly, in the case of SARS, the coronavirus that caused the disease did not have a very high mutation rate relative to other RNA viruses. Coronaviruses have the largest genomes (approximately 30,000 nucleotides) among RNA viruses and genome size and mutation rate appear to be negatively correlated (Sanju\u00e1n et al. 2010) . One reason behind the relative stability of coronavirus genomes could be the presence of proofreading enzymes that guard against mutagenesis. In the case of SARS-CoV, Smith et al. (2013) showed that the exoribonuclease domain in non-structural protein 14 had proofreading activity and was responsible for protecting the viral genome against mutagenesis.

Establishing trusted sources of information prior to emergencies should be a major objective for cities/regional governments. Issues with coordination among government agencies or between medical and government agencies were strong obstacles in the response to SARS in most affected regions (University of Louisville School of Medicine 2003).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rapid Response"}, {"text": "High transmission in medical care settings was one of the prominent features of both the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Because infected individuals with weakened immune systems or co-infections may be the most difficult to diagnose and may show high infectiousness, proper training in pathogen containment is a critical element of epidemic preparation. Similar basic techniques (proper use of gloves, gowns, masks, and goggles) were successful for SARS and Ebola suggesting that many practices will be of general value but specifics for particular transmission mechanisms (e.g. airborne versus vector transmission) are also critical. Intervals between outbreak occurrences may be large, so regular confirmation of preparedness is important. Low margins in health care are strongly linked to overcrowding and government and private organization incentives (e.g., increased funding for hospitals that rate highly on infection control training and preparedness) can greatly enhance hospital safety (Committee on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health System 2007). The importance of patient isolation in limiting disease spread is clear from recent SARS, Ebola and MERS outbreaks; hospitals must have containment facilities and \"surge capacity\" to limit superspreading events. Although public health measures were sufficient to eventually control SARS, additional measures including antiviral drugs and rapid vaccine development and production may be necessary for stronger pathogens. The economic impact of epidemics, roughly 200 billion USD (2 % of regional GDP) for East Asia from SARS and potentially over 800 billion USD for pandemic influenza (The Economist 2005) should help to justify the costs of outbreak preparation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health Care"}, {"text": "Informed sanitation (water purification, sewage treatment) and building regulations/inspections (e.g. airflow control) policies can play a key role in preventing disease emergence and spread. The SARS example illustrates the need for extensive interdisciplinary efforts, combining expertise from physics (fluid mechanics), biology (especially understanding mechanisms of disease transmission), and building design for resilience to future outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interdisciplinary Research and Planning"}, {"text": "Isolation and quarantine were critical to controlling SARS in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Vietnam and Canada. Compliance rates appeared to be high in all regions (University of Louisville School of Medicine 2003) perhaps partly because the \"cultural\" value placed on solidarity and cohesion was relatively high in these regions. More severe movement restrictions may be necessary for more transmissible and/or virulent pathogens. It is unclear whether similar measures can be employed with success in other regions where personal liberties are emphasized and/or government is less trusted. Biological studies can help to determine the necessity and guide planning for future epidemics, but social and economic issues may be the more critical limiting factors in developing preparedness for disease outbreaks. Understanding the social, psychological, and economic costs of previous and potential disease outbreaks among both citizens and government officials will be central to planning for resilient communities. The ability to overcome economic and psychological barriers (e.g., normalcy bias) to implementing such plans may require a fundamental transformation in human society.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Personal Liberties and the Common Good"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: History, current state of affairs and the future", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Alizon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Hurford", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Mideo", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Van Baalen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2009, "venue": "Journal of Evolutionary Biology", "volume": "22", "issn": "", "pages": "245--259", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01658.x"]}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Rapid evolutionary dynamics and disease threats to biodiversity", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Altizer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Harvell", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Friedle", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Trends in Ecology & Evolution", "volume": "18", "issn": "", "pages": "589--596", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1016/j.tree.2003.08.013"]}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Epidemiology, transmission dynamics and control of SARS: The 2002-2003 epidemic.
