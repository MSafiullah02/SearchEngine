Selected patients should have microbiological studies for tuberculosis and legionella infection. The preferred tests for detection of Legionella species are the urinary antigen assay for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and culture with selective media. The rationale for performing microbiological studies to establish an etiologic diagnosis is based on attempts to improve care of the individual patient with pathogen-specific treatment; to improve care of other patients and to advance knowledge by detecting epidemiologically important organisms (Legionella, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus); to implement contact-tracing and antimicrobial prophylaxis in appropriate settings (such as cases of Neisseria meningitidis infection, Haemophilus influenzae type B infection, and tuberculosis); to prevent antibiotic abuse; and to reduce antibiotic expense.",

Patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) should receive ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin-sulbactam, or piperacillin-tazobactam in combination with a fluoroquinolone or macrolide. \u03b2-lactams, other than those noted, are not recommended. Intravenous antibiotics may be switched to oral agents when the patient is improving clinically, is hemodynamically stable, and is able to ingest drugs. Most patients show a clinical response within 3\u20135 days. Changes evident on chest radiographs usually lag behind the clinical response, and repeated chest radiography is generally not indicated for patients who respond.

The activity of macrolides and doxycycline or other \u03b2-lactams, including cefuroxime, is good against penicillin-susceptible strains but less predictable with strains that show reduced penicillin-susceptibility. Vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfopristin are the only drugs with predictable in vitro activity. Fluoroquinolones are generally active against strains that are susceptible or resistant to penicillin, but recent reports indicate increasing resistance in selective locations that correlate with excessive fluoroquinolone use.",

The ability to accurately predict medical outcomes in cases of CAP has a major impact on management. The decision to hospitalize a patient or to treat him or her as an outpatient (figure 1) is perhaps the single most important clinical decision made by physicians during the entire course of illness, which has direct bearing on the location and intensity of laboratory evaluation, antibiotic therapy, and costs.

These factors were well-defined in the pre\u2013penicillin era; studies of adults showed an increased risk with alcohol consumption, increasing age, the presence of leukopenia, the presence of bacteremia, and radiographic changes [12]. More recent studies have confirmed these findings [2, 13\u201318]. Independent associations with increased mortality have also been demonstrated for a variety of comorbid illnesses, such as active malignancies [10, 16, 19], immunosuppression [20, 21], neurological disease [19, 22, 23], congestive heart failure [10, 17, 19], coronary artery disease [19], and diabetes mellitus [10, 19, 24]. Signs and symptoms independently associated with increased mortality consist of dyspnea [10], chills [25], altered mental status [10, 19, 23, 26], hypothermia or hyperthermia [10, 16, 17, 20], tachypnea [10, 19, 23, 27], and hypotension (diastolic and systolic) [10, 19, 26\u201328].",

Furthermore, such rules discount the cumulative importance of multiple simultaneous physiological derangements, especially if each derangement alone does not reach the threshold that defines an abnormal value (e.g., systolic blood pressure of 90/40 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and pulse of 120 beats/min).

However, outbreaks occur among young adults under conditions of crowding, such as in army camps or prisons. S. pneumoniae is second only to Pneumocystis carinii as the most common identifiable cause of acute pneumonia in patients with AIDS [43\u201345]. Legionella is an opportunistic pathogen; legionella pneumonia is rarely recognized in healthy young children and young adults. It is an important cause of pneumonia in organ transplant recipients and in patients with renal failure and occurs with increased frequency in patients with chronic lung disease, smokers, and possibly those with AIDS [46]. Although M. pneumoniae historically has been thought primarily to involve children and young adults, some evidence suggests that it causes pneumonia in healthy adults of any age [8].",

The incidence of pneumonia due to pathogens that are environmentally related would be expected to vary with changes in relevant environmental conditions. For example, the incidence of legionnaires' disease is dependent on the presence of pathogenic Legionella species in water, amplification of the bacteria in reservoirs with the ideal nutritional milieu, use of aerosol-producing devices (which can spread contaminated water via aerosol droplets), ideal meteorological conditions for transporting aerosols to susceptible hosts, and presence of susceptible hosts. Alterations in any of these variables would probably lead to variations in incidence.

Amoxicillin is more effective than penicillin against pneumococci in vitro, with MIC thresholds that are higher. An important problem with these definitions is that, from a clinical point of view, the MIC has entirely different meaning, depending on the infection being treated. A strain with reduced susceptibility (e.g., MIC, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL) behaves as a susceptible organism when it causes pneumonia (see below) but probably not when it causes meningitis [111, 113].",

Variations occur from city to city and within segments of the population or even within institutions in a single city, so the actual results vary greatly, depending on the source of the isolates. NCCLS definitions are based on levels achieved in CSF in cases of meningitis. Much higher levels are achieved in blood and in alveoli. For these reasons, in treating pneumonia with generally accepted doses of penicillins, intermediate resistance is not clinically important; resistance may be important, especially if it is high-grade (e.g., MIC, >4 \u00b5g/mL). Rates of resistance are substantially higher in many European countries than in the United States, with notable exceptions, such as the Netherlands and Germany; in these countries, accepted standards of practice strictly limit antibiotic usage, especially among very young children.",

In accordance with these definitions, up to one-half of strains with reduced penicillin susceptibility also have reduced susceptibility to these cephalosporins (table 11). A greater proportion exhibit resistance to other third-generation and to second-generation cephalosporins. As is the case for penicillin, pneumonia caused by intermediately resistant or even some resistant isolates is likely to respond to treatment with standard doses of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime is less active against S. pneumoniae, and the activity of this or other cephalosporins cannot be predicted by results of in vitro susceptibility tests with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.",

Thus, pneumococci that are penicillin-resistant are also often resistant to other antibiotics, and the most appropriate term to characterize them is multiply antibiotic-resistant (table 11; these data reflect the general situation in the United States as of October 1999).

In the United States, most macrolide resistance is a result of increased drug efflux encoded by mefE (erythromycin MIC, 2\u201332 \u00b5g/mL, and susceptible to clindamycin); it is possible that this resistance may be overcome by achievable levels of macrolides [114]. In Europe, most macrolide resistance is due to a ribosomal methylase encoded by ermAM; this results in high-grade resistance to macrolides and resistance to clindamycin that probably cannot be overcome. It is important to emphasize that resistance to newer macrolides, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, parallels resistance to erythromycin. The prevalence of resistance to tetracyclines among pneumococci is similar to that of resistance to macrolides, but resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is far more prevalent, and use of this combination is discouraged [109\u2013112]. Among FDA-approved drugs, only vancomycin and linezolid are currently effective against essentially all pneumococci. Fluoroquinolones are active against >98% of strains, including penicillin-resistant strains, but resistance to these drugs has begun to increase in some areas where they are used extensively [115\u2013118]. Of the newer drugs, the oxazolidinones [119] and glycopeptides [120] appear to be most promising, with MICs for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae being no higher than those for penicillin-susceptible strains.

It seems likely that, ultimately, penicillin or ceftriaxone may not reliably cure infection caused by strains of S. pneumoniae for which penicillin MICs are \u22654 \u00b5g/mL and ceftriaxone MICs are \u22658 \u00b5g/mL.",

Although vancomycin is nearly certain to provide antibiotic coverage, there is a strong impetus not to use this drug until it is proven to be needed because of fear of the emergence of resistant organisms. Vancomycin or a fluoroquinolone should be used for initial treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in critically ill patients who are allergic to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.

The term generally applies to large-volume aspiration. There are at least 3 distinctive forms [124], based on the nature of the inoculum, the clinical presentation, and management guidelines: toxic injury of the lung (such as due to gastric acid aspiration or Mendelson's syndrome), obstruction (with a foreign body or fluids), or infection (table 12). These syndromes are reviewed elsewhere [125, 126]. Most studies show that aspiration is suspected in 5%\u201310% of patients hospitalized with CAP, although the criteria for this diagnosis are often not provided. In general, the diagnosis should be suspected when patients have a condition that predisposes them to aspiration (usually compromised consciousness or dysphagia) and radiographic evidence of involvement of a dependent pulmonary segment (lower lobes are dependent in the upright position; the superior segments of the lower lobes and posterior segments of the upper lobes are dependent in the recumbent position).",

C. pneumoniae pneumonia may present with sore throat, hoarseness, and headache as important nonpneumonic symptoms; other findings include sinusitis, reactive airways disease, and empyema. Reinfection is common, and hospitalization due to pneumonia caused by C. pneumoniae usually occurs for older patients who have reinfection, in which comorbidities undoubtedly play a significant role in the clinical course. When C. pneumoniae is found in association with other pathogens, particularly S. pneumoniae, the associated pathogen appears to determine the clinical course of the pneumonia [133]. Infection can be suspected with culture of C. pneumoniae, DNA detection and PCR, and serology (most specifically by microimmuno-fluo-res-cent antibodies) [66, 96, 133\u2013135]. However, cell culture is not routinely available except in research laboratories; in addition, PCR technology is not standardized, reagents for PCR are not FDA cleared, and serology is problematic because of nonspecificity [66, 136]. The preferred diagnostic finding is documentation of a 4-fold increase in titer from acute to convalescent specimens, with supporting evidence by PCR or culture. Accordingly, most laboratories cannot confirm a diagnosis of C. pneumoniae pneumonia in a timely fashion, so treatment must be empirical (A-II). For therapy, the IDSA panel recommends a macrolide, doxycycline, or a fluoroquinolone (B-II) [134, 137].",

Risk is related to exposure, increasing age, smoking, and compromised cell-mediated immunity such as in transplant recipients [46]. Although rare in immunocompetent adults aged <30 years, Legionella can be a major cause of lethal pneumonia, with mortality rates of 5%\u201325% among immunocompetent hosts and substantially higher rates among immunosuppressed hosts [46, 138]. Tests commonly cost $50\u2013$100 each, so routine use for hospitalized patients is not usually advocated (table 9). Major indications for testing include severe illness in adults requiring admission to the ICU, pneumonia in hospitalized patients with no other likely etiology (i.e., negative Gram stain), pneumonia in compromised hosts, evidence suggesting Legionella is endemic or epidemic in the area, lack of response to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, or clinical features that suggest Legionella as the cause (C-III) [99].",

Methods of laboratory detection include culture, serology, DFA staining, urinary antigen assay, and PCR. DFA stains require substantial expertise for interpretation, and selection of reagents is critical. PCR is expensive, and there are no FDA-cleared reagents. Tests recommended by the IDSA panel are urinary antigen assay for L. pneumophila serogroup 1, which is not technically demanding and reliably and rapidly detects up to 70% of cases of legionnaires' disease, and culture on selective media, which detects all strains but is technically demanding [46, 139] (B-II).",

Many authorities now consider azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone to be preferred for severe disease. This preference is based on results superior to those with erythromycin in animal models and, in addition, on poor tolerance of erythromycin [46, 140, 141]. FDA-approved drugs for administration against Legionella are erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, and gatifloxacin. A delay in therapy is associated with increased mortality [142]. The IDSA panel considers doxycycline, azithromycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin to be preferred for legionnaires' disease, on the basis of available data (B-II). These drugs are available for oral and parenteral administration. The duration of treatment should be 10\u201321 days, although less for azithromycin because of its long half-life.",

Standard tests to be performed on pleural fluid include appropriate stains and culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as measurement of pH, lactic dehydrogenase concentration, and leukocyte and differential counts.

The most common viruses identified have been the common cold viruses, rhinovirus and coronavirus; others include influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV. A small proportion of cases are of nonviral etiology. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis have been linked to AB [174]. There is little evidence that S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae has an important role in the etiology of AB in adults with community-acquired infections in the absence of chronic obstructive lung disease, airway violation (e.g., tracheostomy), immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS), or serious associated disease, such as cystic fibrosis. For persons with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, semiquantitative analysis of sputum by microscopic examination and culture suggest that H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae may be in greater concentrations than in the absence of exacerbation [175]. The data, however, are inconsistent [176], and most exacerbations appear to be due to factors other than bacterial infection.",

First, the M phenotype, because of an efflux mechanism, is associated with MICs of 2\u20138 \u00b5g/mL and, in theory, may be overcome by high doses; this mechanism is prevalent in the United States. Second, the ERM phenotype, due to ribosomal alterations, is associated with MICs \u226564 \u00b5g/mL; this mechanism predominates in Europe. Cases of macrolide failure have been described anecdotally but have been infrequent so far [114]. Macrolides have reasonably good activity against anaerobes, except for fusobacteria. Community-acquired strains of S. aureus are usually susceptible to macrolides. Most bacteria are susceptible or resistant to all 3 macrolides, but there are some differences. Erythromycin is relatively inactive against H. influenzae. Clarithromycin also has relatively limited in vitro activity against H. influenzae; however, its 14-OH metabolite augments the activity of the parent compound [192, 193].",
