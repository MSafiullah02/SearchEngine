            "text": "of such patients, invasive mechanical ventilation is required 14 [2 , 3] . 15 To avoid in-hospital infection with COVID-19 among 16 healthcare workers, appropriate and strict infection prevention 17 is essential, particularly in aerosol-generating medical proce-18 dures such as tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, cardiopul-19 monary resuscitation, and tracheostomy [4] . When perform-20 ing tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19, meticulous 21 attention should be paid to the details of anesthetic and sur-22 gical management of the tracheostomy to minimize cross-23 contamination and occupational infection among healthcare 24 workers in the hospital. Here, we report our experience with 25 anesthetic and surgical management in a patient with COVID-26 19 who underwent tracheostomy. To prevent aerosol generation of COVID-19 if the cuff 67 would be ruptured by surgical intervention, we examined the 68 chest radiograph before performing the tracheostomy and con-69 firmed that the intubation tube would be inserted up to 27 cm 70 deep from the mouth. After intravenous injection of 70 mg 71 rocuronium for muscle relaxation, 5 mg midazolam for seda-72 tion, and 100 -200 mg fentanyl for pain control, mechanical 73 ventilation was discontinued, and chest movement was con-74 firmed to stop by the anesthesiologist. Thereafter, the intu-75 bation tube was inserted up to 27 cm deep from the mouth, 76 and mechanical ventilation was immediately reinstated. Fi-77 nally, chest movement was confirmed without listening to 78 the patient's chest using a stethoscope. During tracheostomy, 79 0.2 mg/kg of rocuronium was added every half hour to prevent 80 patient movement and coughing. Before the tracheostomy, all members inside and outside 83 the isolation room confirmed that the equipment and surgical 84 devices were ready to use. By administering local anesthe-85 sia around the neck region, surgical tracheotomy was per-86 formed by two otolaryngologists. Before opening the trachea, 87 we confirmed that muscle relaxant action and oxygenation 88 were sufficient for the subsequent surgical procedures. The 89 ventilator was turned off immediately before tracheal incision 90 to avoid aerosol generation of blood or tracheal secretions. A 91 scalpel was used to incise the trachea to reduce the risk of air-92 way fire, and the trachea was opened between the second and 93 third trachea rings. After the trachea was opened, any elec-94 trosurgical device was not used to avoid the aerosolization of 95 Table 1 Tracheostomy protocol in a suspect or probable COVID-19 patient. the tracheostomy ranged from14 days-25 days [7 , 8] . The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki 212 Declaration of 1975 and its amendments, and the laws and 213 regulations of the Japan. Written informed consent was ob-214 tained from the patients. 215 ",

Immediately, the tracheostomy tube was 99 placed into the trachea and was temporally sutured with the 100 trachea to avoid accidental extraction.

Our detailed experience of the tra-129 cheostomy in a patient with COVID-19 is shown inTable 1. 130 Although there is a lack of clear evidence for the manage-131 ment of SARS-CoV-2, anesthesia and surgical techniques are 132 thought to be essential to prevent virus exposure and con-133 tamination to the self and other medical staff based on the 134 results of previous studies on SARS or MERS [double gloves, eye shield, and boots to avoid exposing 151 the medical staff. Further, PAPRs were used for medical staff 152 members who were at a high-risk for the viral infection. Dur-153 ing tracheostomy, surgical procedures should be considered to 154 prevent aerosolization of viral particles in a negative pressure 155 isolation room in ICU. Surgeons should check the surgical 156 field to avoid post-operative bleeding from wound bed be-157 fore incising the trachea using a scalpel. Once the trachea 158 is opened, an electrosurgical device should not be used to 159 avoid aerosolization of viral particles. Notably, sufficient use 160 of muscle relaxants is key to prevent patient movement and 161 coughing, resulting in a considerable benefit for the contain-162 ment policy for COVID-2019 [11] . Although strict precaution 163 requires additional cost, labor, and time to perform surgical 164 procedures, we should understand the importance of infection 165 prevention and perform the necessary medical procedures to 166 avoid aerosol generation. 167 The optimal timing of tracheotomy in critically ill patients 168 remains controversial [12] . Previous reports of the SARS pan-169 demic showed that the timing from tracheal intubation to 170",

To de-174 cide whether a tracheostomy should be performed, repeated 175 careful considerations by the infection prevention team in the 176 hospital are required. It is recommended that tracheostomy 177 should be performed in patients with COVID-19 only when 178 deemed absolutely necessary, and otolaryngologists encounter 179 and have to deal with this difficult situation directly. Thus, we 180 should know the surgical risks and appropriate management 181 of tracheostomy for both the patients and healthcare team 182 involved. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, 43 operative 183 procedures, including 15 surgical tracheostomies, were per-184 formed on SARS-related patients in Singapore. Interestingly, 185 there was no transmission of SARS within the operating room 186 complex, in which staff personal protection, patient risk cat-187 egorization, and reorganization of operating room workflow 188 processes were thoroughly implemented [14] . Similarly, reli-189 able use of PPE (particularly an N95 mask) significantly re-190 duced the risk of infection among critical care nurses during 191 the SARS epidemic[15] . Therefore, we do not overempha-192 size the risk of medical procedures in patients who really need 193 intensive treatment for recovery from illness. Depending on 194 the medical resources in each hospital, region, and country, 195 a tracheostomy should be performed with appropriate contact 196 precautions (i.e., double gloves, gown, and eyewear) and air-197 borne precautions (i.e., PAPRs or masks with filter efficiency 198 of greater than or equal to 95%) for the personal protection 199 of staff during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Appropriate contact, airborne precautions, and sufficient 202 use of muscle relaxants are essential for performing tra-203 cheostomy in a patient with COVID-19.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors have no financial conflicts of interest to de-206 clare.We would like to thank Editage ( www.editage.com) for 209 English language editing.Ethical Statement",
