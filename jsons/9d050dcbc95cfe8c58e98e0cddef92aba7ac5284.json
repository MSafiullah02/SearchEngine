In other conditions, however, higher rhinovirus genomic load is related to the severity and/or duration of acute lower respiratory tract illness, and 1 study reported that it discriminated the response to systemic corticosteroids in terms of less recurrent wheezing. 1, 4, 5 Data on the link between rhinovirus genomic load and clinical outcomes, however, are discordant because studies in subjects with asthma have not shown any clinical association. 6 For these reasons and the relatively small samples in earlier studies, we examined the clinical significance of rhinovirus genomic load in bronchiolitis in 694 children with severe bronchiolitis. Our aim was to prospectively investigate whether rhinovirus genomic load in standardized nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples is associated with short-term outcomes of bronchiolitis.

Our hypothesis was justified on the basis of previous clinical data, 1, 4, 5 which were also supported by in vitro data. 3 Although multiple viral infections are relatively common in severe bronchiolitis (15% to 30%), 7,8 the interplay between viruses is poorly understood. Coinfection with RSVand rhinovirus has been linked to more severe short-term outcomes of bronchiolitis compared with RSV alone, 7 but we found no link between rhinovirus genomic load, coinfections, and these same outcomes. Even when examining the rhinovirus-only group, the association was null. Moreover, investigation of the interaction between the rhinovirus genomic load and atopic status was interesting because atopic children appear to be more susceptible than nonatopic children to rhinovirus-induced wheezing. 2 Considering the large sample size, careful standardization of NPA sampling, and virus diagnostics done with the same protocol in a single laboratory, our results truly suggest no significant association between rhinovirus genomic load and an LOS of 3 days or more or need for intensive care treatment. Although 1 study suggested that rhinovirus genomic load has more clinical relevance in children older than 12 months, 4 this association is not supported by our data or other reports. 5 Because our results contrast the direct association between RSV genomic load and short-term outcomes of bronchiolitis, 10 we speculate that a host response to infection may be more important than virus load in determining the short-term clinical course of rhinovirusinduced bronchiolitis. 3 The study has potential limitations. First, bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis without a common international definition, 11 so we included children up to age 2 years with recurrent wheezing. Results, however, remained consistent when the analysis was restricted to children experiencing their first episode of breathing difficulty during infancy (age <12 months). Second, clinical decisions (eg, hospital admission/discharge or intensive care treatment) were not based on standardized criteria, which may have caused further variability of care. However, the significant association persisted after adjusting for clustering at the hospital level. Third, one might argue that samples from the upper respiratory tract do not reflect conditions in the lower respiratory tract and that nasal airway epithelial cells may respond differently than bronchial epithelial cells to rhinovirus infections. 12 To our knowledge, there are no data on the comparison of rhinovirus genomic load between upper and lower airway samples and their relation to symptoms. Fourth, one could also argue whether we measured the peak of rhinovirus replication due to lack of longitudinal sampling. A peak in virus concentration typically occurs at 48 to 72 hours after infection in experimental models. 13 Because the duration of prehospital symptoms is typically 1 to 3 days in rhinovirus-induced bronchiolitis, 2 our time window of the first 24 hours of the hospitalization may have been optimal.
