Developments in the technique of in vitro cultivation of monolayers of living cells (cell or tissue culture) in the last 20 years have greatly aided the isolation of viruses infecting horses.",

Freshly-collected swabs or washings for virus isolation should be stored in a transport medium (Burrows 1968 ), which will protect the virus from heat-inactivation, and transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible on wet ice. Viruses are grown in the laboratory in susceptible cell cultures, and isolates are identified by pathological effects on cell monolayers, by specific tests, and by serological relationships with antiserums to known groups of viruses. Direct visualisation of virus particles by the electron microscope (Spradbrow and Francis 1969) and fluorescent labelling of antibodies to specific viruses can allow the more rapid identification of viruses.",

Specific antiviral chemotherapeutic agents are not yet available for use in equine virus infections, but antibiotic therapy may aid healing of the lesions by controlling secondary bacterial infection, such as therapy suggested by Pascoe (1969) for equine herpesvirus type I infection of horses occurring under Australian conditions. Apart from the classical control measures of segregation of affected animals and disinfection (Benyon and Miller 1963) , prophylactic vaccination where merited is the main practical means of control. Satisfactory vaccines are not available for several equine viruses (Scott 197 1 ) , but efficient vaccines containing live attenuated viruses are in use overseas for viruses spread by contagion, such as equine herpesvirus type 1 and equine influenza A viruses. A vaccine of cell culture origin for equine arteritis virus has been favourably recommended (Anon 1969). Tnactivated vaccines for Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis are in use in the USA (Anon 1969), and recent Japanese work has indicated the possibility of immunising horses against equine infectious anaemia using a live attenuated virus (Kono et af 1970) .",
