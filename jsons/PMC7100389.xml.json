            "text": "Viruses package their genetic material (DNA or RNA) inside a protein shell: the capsid. Capsids have remarkable materials properties. Some can withstand internal osmotic pressures as high as tens of atmospheres [1] and large mechanical deformations without rupture [2] while others are able to function in extreme physical environments such as high salinity, acidity and temperature [3]. These features make viral capsids of interest for materials science applications (in particular when combined with the intrinsic programmability of viruses [4]). The structural basis of viral capsids that makes them so robust is normally assumed to derive from the fact that capsid proteins self-assemble into shells composed of an interlocked array of proteins. These positionally-ordered capsids are most frequently either cylindrically shaped helical assemblies or spherically shaped icosahedral structures, where the symmetry of the icosahedral capsids are classified according to their triangulation numbers as described by Caspar and Klug (CK) [5].",

In conjunction with bacteria and the nucleated eukaryotes, this resulted in three major branches, or domains in the universal tree of life; the Archaea, the Bacteria and the Eucarya [7]. While Archaea are like bacteria in size and shape, their transcriptional and translational machinery is closer to that of plant and animal cells (eukaryotes), and they may utilize metabolic pathways such as methanogenesis that are unique to certain archaea (methanogens). Further, while Archaea are abundant in soils, oceans and the mammalian GI tract, they are also the dominant organisms in extreme habitats, with halophiles found in hypersaline lakes, acidophiles that thrive in highly acidic springs and acid mine drainage, alkaliphiles in basic environments, and hyperthemophiles that thrive at or near the boiling point of water. For those living at high temperatures, the membrane lipids and membranes are also unlike those of either bacteria or eukaryotes [8].",

The study of archaeal viruses is a young field and fewer than 100 viruses have been studied in any detail [3]. However, this work has already given rise to 17 new viral families [3]. For historical reasons, these viruses are largely associated with either the thermophilic crenarchaeota or the halophilic euryarchaeota, although viruses infecting additional phyla are abundant and begging for attention [9]. Initial studies suggested euryarchaeal viruses are typical head-and-tail phages, though recent studies suggest this is an oversimplification [10]. In contrast, viruses infecting Crenarchaea frequently exhibit remarkably unusual and diverse morphotypes, rather than the more common icosahedral or cylindrically shaped morphologies [3, 11]. In particular, three viral families (Fuselloviridae, Bicaudaviridae, Salterprovirus) are characterized by spindle-shaped (lemon-shaped) capsids [3, 12]. In terms of physical virology this presents us with a fundamental challenge: these capsids cannot be a positionally-ordered protein shells because the spindle shape necessitates the introduction of a large number of five-fold and seven-fold topological defects [13].",

            "text": "One of the best examples of spindle-shaped capsid morphology is Acidianus two-tailed virus (ATV) [14, 15] shown in figure 1. As it exits an infected cell, the ATV capsid initially appears as a tailless lemon-shaped particle. However, over time it grows extended, cylindrical tails at each end of the central, spindle-shaped capsid [14]. This shape change may be driven by the polymerization of a central protein filament that runs the length of the capsid. The two protruding tails are believed to play a role in establishing contact with potential host cells [14], as is the case with more typical bacterial viruses (phage). Importantly, as the tails elongate over time, the volume of the capsid decreases to approximately half its initial volume, yet the overall surface area of the particle remains roughly constant [14]. This suggests the major structural protein(s) in the tails are the same as those in the lemon-shaped capsid. Further, this morphological change occurs at 75 \u00b0C and above; tailless lemon-shaped ATV stored at lower temperatures do not show this morphological transition.",

The simulation revealed (i) that the negative Gauss curvature of an unduloid covered by a particle array automatically generates a plethora of dislocations, disclinations, and strings of dislocations and (ii) that these topological defects remain mobile at temperatures well below the nominal melting temperature of the particle array. The same numerical simulations revealed however that isotropic viscoelastic shells may have serious defects in terms of their function as capsids. Unlike a positionally ordered layer of particles, a viscoelastic layer may not be able to resist the formation of bulges. In the simulations, we observed significant variations in the local tension around the structural defects. As will be discussed in more detail later, variations in the tension across the surface of a pressure vessel can lead to the growth of bulges, as happens during the formation of aneurysms on blood vessels. In this context, it should be noted that it is not known if the osmotic pressure inside ATV capsids is as high as that of bacterial viruses (phage) [1], although an internal pressure of 10 ATM has been shown for His1, a salterprovirus with a lemon-shaped capsid [22].",

Importantly, the side-by-side or intrastrand interactions between capsid protein subunits within a helix or spiral appear significantly stronger than the inter-strand interactions between spirals. In this paper it is proposed that the capsids of ATV and ATSV are anisotropic visco-elastic materials, specifically smectic liquid crystals, driven by the polymerization of capsid proteins into spirals. In section 2 we present a model free energy for capsids in the smectic state, based on a chiral version of the Landau\u2013Brazovskii Hamiltonian. In section 3, we show an ATV-like capsid in the smectic state can undergo large-scale shape changes without a prohibitive energy penalty while in section 4 we examine the resistance of such vesicles against bulge formation.",

For these values, the maximum pressure the smectic caspid could withstand would be in the range of 10 atmospheres. This is comparable to the osmotic pressure inside conventional phage viruses, which suggests that smectic capsids indeed could withstand significant osmotic pressures. Note that increasing the stiffness of the polymer chains in order to increase the maximum pressure would have the (undesired) effect of freezing the protein array. This is undesired because large shape changes would be inhibited. More definite estimates have to await measurement of the persistence length of the capsid protein chains of the archaeal viruses (if any). It certainly would be interesting if synthetic smectic capsids composed polymerizing chiral proteins could be fabricated in which case the persistence length would be known.",
