Recently, triggered in part by media reports on potential efficacy, CQ and HCQ have been widely used off-label for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. These drugs were suggested for clinical usage after in vitro activity was observed against COVID-19.1,2 The molecular mechanism is believed to involve action at multiple steps in the viral pathway, including cellular entry and exit. These drugs alter intracellular pH, and may induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, causing misformation of essential viral proteins. However, in vitro activity of these drugs should not be interpreted as proof of clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Similar in vitro activity of CQ and HCQ was identified against multiple other viruses, but follow-up clinical trials did not show significant clinical efficacy of these drugs, for example, against Ebola virus disease,3 chikungunya,4 influenza,5 HIV infection,6 and dengue.7",

This ethical consideration justifies initiation of clinical trials; many are planned or are underway to study CQ and HCQ for treating or preventing COVID-19 in different countries (as examples: NCT04315896,11 NCT04318015,12 NCT04318444,13 NCT04321278,14 NCT04308668,15 NCT04304053,16 NCT04316377,17 and NCT0430329918).

Given a lack of evidence and intense pressure to try something in COVID-19 patients, clinicians may increasingly turn to off-label usage of drugs. We call on public health organizations to urgently consider creating or expanding partnerships with local governments to support unified RCTs to test the efficacies of potential therapeutics against COVID-19. Leveraging the previously developed adaptive RCT design from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) PALM trial, which efficiently assesses multiple arms against a common comparator, the NIAID, National Institute of Health, and the WHO have already launched COVID-19 RCTs. The NIAID trial is a multinational placebo-controlled trail of 440 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, initially comparing remdesivir with placebo.22 The WHO solidarity trial is a large, adaptive, five-arm trial comparing four promising COVID-19 regimens: remdesevir, CQ, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir plus interferon beta, all compared with standard of care, with mortality as the primary end point.23 Both trials require close data and safety monitoring board oversight and allow for dropping poorly performing arms and adding promising putative therapeutics as they are developed. So far, many countries, including Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and Thailand have signed up for the trial. Both trials are examples of robust efforts to generate high-quality evidence to identify medicines that may potentially save lives in the global battle against COVID-19.",
