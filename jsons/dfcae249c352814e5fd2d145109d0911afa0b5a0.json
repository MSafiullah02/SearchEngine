Suggested Kawasaki disease pathogens include Staphylococcus [Hall et al., 1999] , Streptococcus [Shinomiya et al., 1987; Kikuta et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1995] , adenovirus [Embil et al., 1985] , human herpesvirus 6 [Okano et al., 1989] , Epstein-Barr virus [Kikuta et al., 1992] , parvovirus B19 [Holm et al., 1995] , human lymphotropic virus [Okano, 1999] , and human bocavirus [Catalano-Pons et al., 2007] ; however, none of these pathogens have been confirmed to cause Kawasaki disease. Recent reports have suggested that heat shock proteins and superantigens produced by bacteria are associated with the development of Kawasaki disease [Matsubara and Fukaya, 2007; Nagata et al., 2009 ]. However, Rowley et al. [2005] reported that synthetic Kawasaki disease antibodies detected intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which were consistent with aggregates of viral proteins and nucleic acids. They also reported that the inclusion bodies seen in Kawasaki disease lesions did not have the substructure characteristic of bacterial inclusion bodies. Instead, RNA, not DNA, was present in the inclusion bodies, suggesting that an RNA virus contributes to the development of Kawasaki disease [Rowley et al., 2008; Rowley, 2011] .",

Several HCoVs have been identified as causative agents of the human common cold, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 (OC43), HCoV-HKU1 [Woo et al., 2005] , and HCoV-NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] . In 2005, it was reported that a new strain, HCoV-NL63 [Esper et al., 2005b] , was possibly associated with Kawasaki disease as parts of the spike (S) and replicase genes were detected in 8 of 11 (72.7%) respiratory specimens from patients with Kawasaki disease, as compared to 1 of 22 (4.5%) specimens from age-and region-matched controls [Esper et al., 2005a] . However, many subsequent reports failed to confirm the relationship between Kawasaki disease and HCoV-NL63. For example, Dominguez et al. [2006] tried to detect HCOV-NL63 genes by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal-wash samples, and detected it in 2 of 26 (7.7%) patients with Kawasaki disease and 4 of 52 (7.7%) matched controls. In addition, Shimizu et al. [2005] detected HCoV-NL63 genes in only 1 of 48 (2%) patients with Kawasaki disease. Additionally, other reports failed to show a relationship between HCoV-NL63 and Kawasaki disease [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009] .",

[2008] reported that 75% and 65% of 2.5-to 3.5-year-old children were HCoV-NL63-and HCoV-229E-seropositive, respectively, and that most of the children had seroconverted to HCoVs by the age of 6. This high prevalence of seropositivity suggests that most people experience an acute HCoV infection during childhood. Therefore, HCoV is a possible causative agent of Kawasaki disease, although other factors, including genetic background, could also be involved in the development of Kawasaki disease.",

To detect viral genes in specimens, sampling must be performed at a critical time; if the virus infection does not persist and the samples are collected after the infection is over, then the detection of viral genes is quite difficult. Therefore, we performed a serological study to examine the involvement of HCoV-NL63 in Kawasaki disease. HCoV-229E was included as a control for HCoV-NL63. For the serological test, paired serum samples from patients with Kawasaki disease who had not been treated with g-globulin and matched control sera were examined. The results suggested that HCoV-NL63 is not a causative agent of Kawasaki disease. Instead, a particular strain of HCoV-229E might trigger Kawasaki disease.",

All Kawasaki disease cases met diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease and thus judged as definitive Kawasaki disease patients. There was no suspected case. Two of them showed cardiac complication, and one of them showed coronary artery ectasia in both acute and recovery phases. Other cases did not show coronary lesions. Control serum specimens collected from healthy children from 2001 to 2002 were obtained from the serum bank at the NIID. Since there was insufficient serum to perform all of the neutralizing tests, the control samples were separated randomly into two groups [group 1 (23 specimens) and group 2 (29 specimens)], and one was used for a neutralizing test with VSVpseudotyped viruses while the other was used for a neutralizing test with infectious HCoV-229E. The details of the specimens are shown in Table I . No statistical difference in age and sex was detected among control serum and specimens from patients with Kawasaki disease.

To neutralize the VSVpseudotyped virus, ca. 500 GFP count viruses were mixed with DMEM containing 5% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and serum (diluted 1:100).

Then, the samples were incubated for 60 min at 4\u02daC and inoculated onto the HeLa cell monolayers. The viruses were allowed to adsorb for 1 hr at 34\u02daC and the cells were washed three times with DMEM. Next, the infected cells were cultured with DMEM containing 5% FCS (for VSV-pseudotyped virus) or 10% TPB and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (for infectious HCoV-229E). For the VSV-pseudotyped virus, the medium was replaced with fresh phosphate-buffered saline after 24 hr and cell images were captured and the numbers of GFP fluorescence-positive cells were counted with VH-H1A5 software (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). To evaluate HCoV-229E infection, cells were fixed with 20% formalin after a 2-day incubation, stained with crystal violet, and the plaques were counted; 1% FCS was used as a negative control and specific anti-VR740 or -Sendai-H rabbit serum was used as a positive control in each neutralizing test.

A standard strain of HCoV-229E (VR740) was used as a control for HCoV-NL63.

Therefore, these two viruses were used to estimate the relationship between HCoV-229E and Kawasaki disease development. First, the neutralizing profiles of control specimens were analyzed (Fig. 2) . For the neutralizing tests, because the concentrated serum contained a factor that non-specifically blocked infection of the pseudotype virus, the sera were diluted 1:100 for the VSV-pseudotyped virus and 1:20 for infectious HCoV-229E. The control sera showed around 30% positivity in neutralizing tests using the VSV-pseudotype viruses and about 10% positivity using infectious HCoV-229E viruses; no significant difference in positivity was detected between VR-740 and Sendai-H. If HCoV-229E were a causative agent of Kawasaki disease, then seroconversion would be detected in sera collected from the acute and recovery phases of Kawasaki disease. Thus, the levels of HCoV-229E neutralizing antibodies in sera obtained from both phases in patients with Kawasaki disease was examined (Fig. 3) . The study using VSV-pseudotype viruses showed that the positivity for VR740 in the acute phase was 13%, while that in the recovery phase was 20%. When examined with infectious viruses, the respective values for VR740 were 13% and 27%. For Sendai-H, the VSV-pseudotyped virus showed that the positivity rates in the acute and recovery phases were 53% and 80%, respectively; however, while using infectious Sendai-H, the respective rates were 20% and 40%. The positivity in the recovery phases seemed to be higher than that in the acute phases; however, no statistically significant difference in seropositivity was detected between them for both viruses. These results suggest that HCoV-229E infection is not a direct trigger of Kawasaki disease. Even in the acute phase of Kawasaki 3 . Fifteen paired serum specimens were collected from Kawasaki disease patients who had not received any g-globulin. An neutralizing test was performed for each acute-and recovery-phase sample. More than 50% neutralization was considered positive. disease, the viral infection had already subsided and antibodies were produced.",

These facts are in good agreement with the finding that a recent case of Kawasaki disease examined in this study was related to HCoV-229E Sendai-H rather than VR740. Moreover, a mild cold is known to precede the onset of Kawasaki disease and, thus, the agent that causes this respiratory disease could be a good candidate to trigger Kawasaki disease.

One possible explanation for this result is that the virus infection has already subsided when Kawasaki disease is first apparent in patients, and that the antibody against HCoV-229E is already present even in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease. In the recovery phase, a slight increase in positivity may occur, although such an increase was not statistically significant in our study. Alternatively, many cases of Kawasaki disease examined in the present study may not seem serious. Serious cases are normally treated with g-globulin transfer in about 80% of patients with Kawasaki disease in Japan [Yanagawa et al., 1995d] . Virus infection may not have been intense in patients with Kawasaki disease and, thus, the antibody response was low. Future studies would be facilitated by the availability of sera from normal individuals before Kawasaki disease onset and before g-globulin treatment after Kawasaki disease onset. Such cohort studies would be invaluable in determining whether HCoV is the Kawasaki disease triggering agent.",
