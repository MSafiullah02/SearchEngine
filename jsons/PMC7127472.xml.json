Since the most common of the microcytic anemias is IDA, we recommend determination of the serum ferritin level as the initial step for all patients with microcytic anemia (Figure 1\n).13 A low serum ferritin level is diagnostic of IDA. Similarly, contrary to current dogma regarding acute phase reaction, a diagnosis of IDA is unlikely in the presence of a persistently normal or elevated serum ferritin level.14 In general, we do not recommend either other serum iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation) or bone marrow biopsy for evaluation of IDA.10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n",

In general, Hgb electrophoresis results are normal in the a-thalassemia trait and abnormal in the \u03b2-thalassemia trait as well as in other thalassemic syndromes.15 Furthermore, during the interpretation of Hgb electrophoresis, one must remember that concomitant IDA may mask the typical abnormality seen in the \u03b2-thalassemia trait, which is an increase in Hgb A2 (a2d2) level from the normal value of 2% to a value of 3% to 6%.15\n",

Patient history is key in implicating bleeding as a cause of anemia, and a fecal occult blood test can be ordered if indicated.

Both TTP/HUS and disseminated intravascular coagulation are characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thus display schistocytes on PBS, an increased LDH level, and a decreased haptoglobin level.35 However, coagulation studies are usually normal in TTP/HUS, whereas clotting times are prolonged in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

True polycythemia is caused by either PV, which is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder, or a nonclonal increase in RCM that is often, but not always, driven by erythropoietin (secondary polycythemia). Therefore, PV must be distinguished from both apparent and secondary polycythemia.

Chronic thrombocytosis, in the absence of surgical asplenia, is highly suggestive of PT. Initial laboratory tests in this instance, as well as in the absence of clinical evidence for RT, should include PBS, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein87 (Figure 6\n). Platelet morphology is normal in RT, but the PBS may reveal the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies in patients with asplenia, anisocytosis and poikilocytosis in patients with IDA, and polychromasia in patients with hemolysis. A normal serum ferritin level excludes the possibility of IDA-associated RT. However, a low serum ferritin level does not exclude the possibility of PT. A measurement of C-reactive protein is helpful in examining the possibility of an occult inflammatory or malignant process as a cause of RT.87\n",

Such processes may be derived from B-cell, T-cell, or natural killer cell lineage.114 However, the PBS has limited value in the differential diagnosis of lymphocytosis; we recommend, in addition, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry in all such cases. The immunophenotypic profile that accompanies the myriad of chronic lymphoid leukemia is outlined in Table 4 as a resource for the hematologist. In general, we recommend a hematology consultation for any lymphocytosis that is not reactive.",

In general, it is prudent to perform a PBS in most instances of abnormal CBC, along with basic tests that are dictated by the type of CBC abnormalities. The latter may include, for example, serum ferritin in patients with microcytic anemia or lymphocyte immunophenotyping by flow cytometry in patients with lymphocytosis; whether a hematology consultation is needed can be based on the initial laboratory results, which always are reviewed in the context of the clinical history. However, a prompt hematology consultation is encouraged in patients with severe cytopenia, pancytopenia, or extreme cytosis of any type or when a PBS report suggests TTP or acute leukemia. Finally, we strongly encourage the practice of always reviewing old medical records before initiating a costly work-up of an \u201cabnormal\u201d CBC.",
