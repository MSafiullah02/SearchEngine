            "text": "One of the largest effects of climate change is likely to be reflected in changes in water resource use, which will need to account for water\u2019s equally important roles in electricity production/greenhouse gas production (King and Webber 2008) and ecological service provision (Corvalan et al. 2005; Keath and Brown 2009) so as to provide more sustainable water services into the future. A likely consequence of these changed services is an increase in the use of water fit-for-purpose. For example, where there is municipal water supply, not treating all to drinking water quality, give that less than 10% is required in the home for that purpose (Rathjen et al. 2003). Rather, for other urban and irrigation needs, there will be increased use of recycled wastewater streams for toilet flushing, garden/crop irrigation and cloths washing, so reducing the demand on traditional urban water resources (possibly up to 70%) and keeping environmental water to support ecological services and reduce trans-boundary effects of water pollution.",

            "text": "At a regional scale and in developed regions, climate change is already having a profound impact on water decisions within Australia (WSAA 2008), and is expected to have major impacts in many other regions. For example, Californian water resources are projected to significantly change with respect to snowpack, river flows, and sea levels. By 2050, it is predicted that the Sierra snowpack will decline by 25%, which is an important source of urban, agricultural, and environmental water (California Department of Water Resources 2009). More variable weather patterns may also result in increased dryness in the southern regions of California. The sea level has risen about 7 inches at the Golden Gate Bridge in the last century, and continued sea level rise could threaten many coastal communities, as well as the sustainability of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that supplies 25 million Californians with drinking water. As a consequence, water reuse has to increase, most likely via a second non-potable supply pipe to homes (Okum 2002) and/or through wastewater irrigation (direct or via aquifer storage and recovery) (Kracman et al. 2001; Dillon et al. 2009), which will open up new ecological niches for waterborne pathogens.",

            "text": "An example of the possible effects of climate change on waterborne pathogens in developing regions can be seen in the increases in diarrheal disease during El Ni\u00f1o periods in Peru. For each 1\u00b0C increase in temperature, hospital admission increased by 8% (95% CI 7\u20139%), with an additional 6,225 cases of diarrheal disease recorded (Checkley et al. 2000). In Fiji, diarrheal disease appears to increase by 3% (95% CI 1.2\u20135.0%) per 1\u00b0C temperature increase, noting also that a significant increase in diarrhea rates occurred if rainfall was either higher or lower than average conditions (Singh et al. 2001). Overall in developing regions, water, sanitation and hygiene-related disease currently account for some 5.5% of total disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn et al. 2008). Changes in diarrheal disease has been the main metric used in WHO reports on possible climate change impacts related to waterborne disease (McMichael et al. 2004; Campbell-Lendrum and Woodruff 2006). What is not clear from most reports, however, are the trans-boundary effects, let alone the raft of other diseases unrelated to diarrhea (e.g., see Table 5.2 and Niklasson et al. 1998; Blinkova et al. 2009). For example, given the increase in aquaculture produce from developing regions, what may be the impact on countries that purchase these products for increased diarrhea and other disease endpoints?\n",

Given the globalization of food products, however, numerous disease outbreaks have been recorded for other situations when crops eaten raw are spray irrigated with poorly treated water (Rose et al. 2001; Jay et al. 2007; CDC 2009b). The latter is of particular concern with zoonotic pathogens in surface water (Bharti et al. 2003; Fayer 2004; Bednarska et al. 2007; Mattison et al. 2007; Moulin-Schouleur et al. 2007; Zell et al. 2008; Banyai et al. 2009; Robertson 2009; Rutjes et al. 2009), which includes viruses, bacteria and parasitic protozoa (Table 5.2).",

            "text": "As an example of the difficulty in describing human pathogens one can look at members of the important waterborne parasitic protozoan genus Cryptosporidium. Most human illness is thought to be due to C. hominis and C. parvum (cattle genotype), yet several other Cryptosporidium species or genotypes: C. meleagridis; C. felis; C. canis; C. suis; C. muris; C. andersoni; C. hominis monkey genotype; C. parvum (mouse genotype); C. parvum (pig genotype II) and Cryptosporidium rabbit genotype have caused human illness (Kv\u00e1\u010d et al. 2009). So how to target the right species? In a similar way but at the strain level within a species, Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been the focus of method development and study, due to numerous water- and food-borne outbreaks. Yet focusing on O157:H7 strains appears to be at the detriment of missing the even more important non-O157 shiga toxin-producing E. coli(Bettelheim 2007; Lathrop et al. 2009). The situation is further complicated in E. coli, which is probably better described as pangenomic (i.e. not a single isolated species, but one that shares many genes amongst a broader range of related members) that includes the six known pathovars, each of which may have separately inherited particular virulence factors (Rasko et al. 2008).",

Hence, the emergence of toxigenic V. cholerae involves horizontal gene transfer, in vivo gene expression and follows phage seasonality. In marine waters V. cholerae becomes resistant to the phage, yet in the intestine it remains susceptible and hence, maintains its virulence (Zahid et al. 2008). Also, V. choleraeis commensal to phytoplankton and their consumers zooplankton, notably copepods, as such it is also a vector-borne disease.

They have shown that class 1 integrons are common in nonpathogenic soil and freshwater \u03b2-Proteobacteria in the absence of antibiotic resistance genes, yet are almost identical to the core of the class 1 integrons now found in pathogens, suggesting that environmental \u03b2-Proteobacteria were the original source of these genetic elements. Because these elements appear to be readily mobilized, their lateral transfer into human commensals and pathogens was inevitable, especially given their intersect with the human food chain. The strong selection pressure imposed by the human use of antimicrobial compounds then ensured their fixation and global spread into new species (Hardwick et al. 2008; Gillings et al. 2009). Hence, changing food production practices influenced by population growth, water resources and climate change will further impact on our loss of efficacy in antibiotics. Newer treatment systems for wastewater are also not completely effective at removing resistance genes (Bockelmann et al. 2009) and intensive animal facilities are a likely hotspot for exchange of antibiotic resistance genes (Kozak et al. 2009; Toomey et al. 2009).",
