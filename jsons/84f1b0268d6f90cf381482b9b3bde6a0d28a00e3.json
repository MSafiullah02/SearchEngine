The report highlighted the importance of human factors (now better referred to as human factors and ergonomics, HF&E) in airway management safety. A small follow up study of NAP4 cases showed that HF&E factors were legion and pivotal in all cases considered. 6 The report made 168 recommendations directed at adult and paediatric, anaesthesia, emergency medicine and intensive care specialties. Whilst these recommendations were diverse, they articulated the need for better preparedness in airway management. Airway preparedness can usefully be divided into two factors: institutional preparedness and individual or personal preparedness. Thereafter a formal proposal was made to the RCoA and accepted. 8 A year after its inception, the role was established in 95% of departments 9 and it has remained at, or close, to 100% ever since.",

A year after the network was formed and three years after NAP4 was published, a survey of Airway Leads identified major changes in airway practices throughout the UK. As a result, 98% of hospitals had made changes in practice including closing the safety gap (the gap between ideal practice and actual practice based on NAP4 recommendations) of approximately 40% in anaesthesia, 50% in ED and 60% in ICU. 9 Although not specifically labelled a Quality Improvement initiative, these changes represent a very successful example of quality improvement on a national scale.

However, the ethos of the Airway Lead remains the same: someone who \"work(s) collegially with their colleagues to ensure appropriate systems are in place\" and \"an airway lead is an anaesthetist working at grass roots level who promotes safe airway management within their hospital.\" 17 Despite the apparent success of the Airway Leads Network there is no doubt that more needs to be done. Updates to devices, techniques and guidelines are ever present and it is a challenge to an Airway Lead to decide if, how and when these should be introduced at a local level as it requires simultaneous education and training for many members of staff. 19 Airway misadventure continues to occur and given the complexity of delivering safe airway management as described above this cannot be a surprise.

The institution must provide the correct physical environment with up to date and fit for purpose airway equipment in all locations where an airway may be managed. The hospital should have appropriate staffing all day every day to manage predictable routine and emergency cases. There should be current evidence-based policies, standard operating procedures (SOPs) or guidelines. Their existence should be communicated to staff in a structured manner via induction programmes, training days and ideally simulation. Monitoring of staff to ensure familiarity should be in place and should be structured.7 Personal preparedness involves the individual practitioner undertaking appropriate knowledge acquisition and learning technical and non-technical skills. However, it goes much further and includes ensuring personal familiarity with that institution's policies, SOPs and guidelines, familiarity with the location and content of emergency airway equipment, knowing the means of calling for help and responding to help when necessary and engaging with induction, training and simulation. NAP4 made the specific recommendation that each hospital should have a Departmental Airway Lead (AWL) and this was endorsed by the Council of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA).",
