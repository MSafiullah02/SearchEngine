It is caused by a Gammacoronavirus called Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and has a positive sense single\u2010stranded 27.6 kb RNA genome (Jackwood & De Wit, 2013). The IBV genome can evolve rapidly by mutation and recombination events, resulting in the emergence of new IBV variants which sometimes confer minimal or negligible cross\u2010protection (de Wit et al., 2011). A majority of such variants cause a transitory problem, which then disappear or remain confined into a specific geographical region. However, a few variants can persist and spread to new areas where they continue to cause disease (Jackwood, 2012; de Wit et al., 2011).",

It was first detected in China in 1996 (Yu et al., 2001) and then reported in Asia, Middle East, Europe, and South America (Ababneh, Dalab, Alsaad, & Al\u2010Zghoul, 2012; Huang, Lee, Cheng, & Wang, 2004; Jackwood, 2012; Marandino et al., 2015; Rimondi et al., 2009). In Italy, the Q1 genotype was reported for the first time in 2011 after causing an outbreak of disease associated with respiratory signs, increased mortality, kidney lesions, and proventriculitis (Toffan et al., 2013). Since then, the genotype has been continuously detected in Italy (Massi et al., 2015). Phylogenetic analysis performed using full or partial S1 sequences showed a high identity (>99%) with Chinese Q1 isolates (Franzo et al., 2015; Massi et al., 2015; Toffan et al., 2013). At a similar period, a high identity (94.1%) between those strains and strains belonging to the 624I genotype was observed (Franzo et al., 2015; Massi et al., 2015), such that the recently proposed new IBV nomenclature based on the S1 sequence placed them in the same lineage (GI\u201016) (Valastro et al., 2016).",

This genotype continued to be detected in Italy until 2004 and then reappeared from 2010 when it was again detected in a few broiler farms affected by respiratory disease located in different areas of Italy. In the following years, the number of detections increased (Massi, 2013) but since 2013 the 624I genotype has not been further detected (Massi et al., 2015).",

Evidence of the presence of this genotype has also been found in Slovenia, where several 624I strains were isolated between 1991 and 1999 (Krapez, Slavec, Barlic\u2010Maganja, & Rojs, 2010), in Poland and South Africa (Capua et al., 1999) and eventually in Russia where 624I genotype was reported in 2002 (Bochkov, Batchenko, Shcherbakova, Borisov, & Drygin, 2006).",

The isolate shows a genome organization slightly different when compared to the genome organization of most IBVs previously reported (5\u2032UTR\u20101a\u20101b\u2010S\u20103a\u20103b\u2010E\u2010M\u20105a\u20105b\u2010N\u20103\u2032UTR) (Cavanagh, 2005), since ORF analysis showed the presence of accessory genes 4b, 4c, and 6b already reported for TCoV and other IBVs (Abolnik, 2015; Hewson, Ignjatovic, Browning, Devlin, & Noormohammadi, 2011). It is not clear whether the scarcity of reports of presence of the accessory genes 4b, 4c, and 6b in IBVs is due to their absence in some genomes; or whether it depends on algorithms and software used by other authors for those ORF's detections. A recent ORF analysis of the genome of the Q1 strain gammaCoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13, (Marandino et al., 2017) did not support the presence of ORF 6b in contrast to the results presented here. On the contrary, a recent study confirmed the expression of the 4b protein after M41 IBV infection in vitro (Bentley, Keep, Armesto, & Britton, 2013). IBV accessory genes 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b are known to be not necessary for viral replication, but several studies demonstrated their involvement in the pathogenicity of the virus (van Beurden et al., 2017; Kint, Dickhout et al., 2015; Kint, Fernandez\u2010Gutierrez et al., 2015, 2016). A similar function might be hypothesized also for genes 4b, 4c, and 6b, especially in the light that the 4b homologous gene in the MERS\u2010CoV has been reported as an antagonist of type I interferon response (Yang et al., 2013) and that the 6b homologue in SARS\u2010CoV was shown to be able to induce apoptosis (Ye, Wong, Li, & Xie, 2008). More studies need to be done to improve the knowledge on these three accessory genes, in particular whether they are peculiar of certain genotypes and whether their expression influences the pathogenicity or the tropism of the virus.",

Our findings, strongly suggest a common origin between the two genotypes. The basal location of the 624I strain in both the phylogenetic trees, coupled with the epidemiological data available, suggests that this genotype might have played a role in the emergence of Chinese Q1. This model requires long\u2010distance intercontinental dispersion of the 624I genotype and this possibility is supported by its ability to circulate for extended periods within the same country (Taddei et al., 2012) and beyond a geographical area (Capua et al., 1999; Krapez et al., 2010). Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive model explaining the intercontinental dispersal of the 624I genotype. Some hypothesis can be proposed, such as migratory birds, illegal trading and poultry movement. Albeit speculative, these hypotheses seem to be supported by the detection of 624I genotype in Russia, which represents an intermediate position between Europe and the Far East (Bochkov et al., 2006). Further investigations are needed since, despite the IBV worldwide dissemination has been observed and accepted for other genotypes (Franzo et al., 2017), the mechanism behind this evidence is not fully understood.",

The identification of such a recombination event within the 1a gene might explain the relatively high genetic diversity between 624I strain gammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/IP14425/96 and Q1 Chinese strain CK/CH/LDL/97I, two viruses isolated only one year apart.",
