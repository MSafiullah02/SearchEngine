            "text": "An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing till December 2019. As of March 16 2020, It has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths worldwide. During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID) are rising worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and control the virus with limited resource. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread (R 0 > 1, R c > 1) is already present in all the five provinces. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. However, long term predictions for Hubei reveals that the symptomatic COVID cases will show oscillatory behaviour. Futher, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Numerical results show that the modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei. Thus, COVID is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. Health care officials should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in the affected areas.",

Now coronavirus is officially called COVID-19 by WHO (World Health Though COVID-19 laboratory testing ramped up rapidly in China and elsewhere as of January 2020, China's central government and all local governments, including Hubei, have tightened preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Many major cities in Hubei province were locked up and several steps were taken, such as quarantining infected cases, tracing close contacts, promoting social consensus on self-protection such as wearing face masks in public places, etc. To control the outbreak, Chinese government actively restricts the movement of more than 50 million people in Central China, which is considered one of the largest quarantine in human history. More than 42,600 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in China as of February 10 [1]. The country is literally at a standstill and the disease has seriously impacted the economy and the livelihood of the people.",

            "text": "As the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID- 19) is expanding rapidly in China and beyond, with the potential for becoming a global pandemic [2] , real-time analyzes of epidemiological data are required to increase situational awareness and inform interventions [43] . Earlier, in the first few weeks of an outbreak, real-time analyzes shed light on the severity, transmissibility, and natural history of an emerging pathogen, such as SARS, the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola [18; 19; 24; 37] . Analysis of detailed patient line lists is especially useful for inferring key epidemiological parameters, such as infectious and incubation periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation and case reporting [18; 19] . However, official patient's health data seldom become available to the public early in an outbreak, when the information is most required. In addition to medical and biological research, theoretical studies based on either mathematical or statistical modeling may also play an important role throughout this anti-epidemic fight in understanding the epidemic character traits of the outbreak, in predicting the inflection point and end time, and in having to decide on the measures to reduce the spread. To this end, many efforts have been made at the early stage to estimate key epidemic parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, serial interval, and doubling time, in which the statistical models are mostly used [40; 35] . An Imperial College London study group calculated that 4000 (95% CI: 1000-9700) cases had occurred in Wuhan with symptoms beginning on January 18, 2020, and an estimated basic reproduction number was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5-3.5) using the number of cases transported from Wuhan to other countries [32] . Leung et al. reached a similar finding, calculating the number of cases transported from Wuhan to other major cities in China [9] and also suggesting the possibility for the spreading of risk [12] for travel-related diseases. Mathematical modeling based on dynamic equations [25; 45] may provide detailed mechanism for the disease dynamics. A variety of modeling experiments for the COVID-19 outbreak have already been carried out. Wu et al. [49] developed an susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) model to explain the dynamics of transmission and predicted national and global disease spread based on data recorded from 31 December 2019 to 28 January 2020. Tang et al. [46] suggested a compartmental deterministic model incorporating the disease's clinical development, the patient epidemiological status and the intervention steps. They found that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 , and that intervention strategies including intense contact tracing accompanied by quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce COVID cases. Using the hypothesis of Poisson-distributed daily time increments Read et al. [41] stated a value of basic reproduction number to be 3.1 based on A SEIR model fitted to real data. Imai et al. [31] performed computational modeling of possible epidemic trajectories in order to estimate the size of the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan, with a emphasis on human to human transmission. Their findings suggest that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission in order to contain the outbreak effectively. Among these, the classical SEIR is the most widely accepted model for characterizing the COVID outbreak epidemic in China. Since the dynamical model can reach comprehensible conclusions about the outbreak, a cascade of SEIR models is being developed to visualize the mechanisms of transmission from source of infection, hosts, reservoir to human [16] .",

In addition, our model includes a net inflow of susceptible individuals into the region at a rate \u03a0 per unit time. This parameter includes new births, immigration and emigration. The flow diagram of the proposed model is displayed in Figure 1 . By recruiting individuals into the region, the susceptible population is increased and reduced by natural death. Also the susceptible population decreases after infection, acquired through interaction between a susceptible individual and an infected person who may be quarantined, asymptomatic, symptomatic, or isolated. For these four groups of infected individuals, the transmission coefficients are \u03b2, r Q \u03b2, r A \u03b2, and r J \u03b2 respectively. We consider the \u03b2 as a transmission rate along with the modification factors for quarantined r Q , asymptomatic r A and isolated r J individuals. The interaction between infected individuals (quarantined, asymptomatic, symptomatic or isolated) and susceptible is modelled in the form of total population without quarantined and isolated individuals using standard mixing incidence incidence [38; 39; 23; 29] .

We fit the model (2.8) to daily new isolated cases of COVID in the five provinces. Due to the high transmissibility the notified cases are immediately isolated, and therefore it is convenient to fit the isolated cases to reported data. Also we fit the model (2.8) to cumulative isolated cases of COVID in those five provinces. We estimate the diseases transmission rates by humans, \u03b2 , quarantine rate of exposed individuals, \u03b3 1 , isolation rate of infected individual, \u03b3 2 , rate at which quarantined individuals are isolated, k 2 , recovery rate from quarantined individuals, \u03c3 1 , recovery rate from asymptomatic individuals, \u03c3 2 , recovery rate from isolated individuals, \u03c3 4 , and initial population sizes to match the COVID cases in five provinces of China. The COVID data are fitted using the Nonlinear Least Squares fitting routine lsqnonlin in the optimization tool box (MATLAB, R2017a). The estimated parameters are given in Table 3 . We also estimate the initial conditions of the human population and the estimated values are given by Table 4 . The fitting of the daily new isolated COVID cases in five provinces of China are displayed in Figure 2 and the fitting of the daily cumulative isolated cases are displayed in Figure 3 . Using these estimated parameters and the fixed parameters from Table 1 , we calculate the basic reproduction numbers (R 0 ) and control reproduction numbers (R c ) for all of the five provinces. These estimates are given in Table 5 From Table 5 , we observe that the estimated R 0 values matches with the previous estimates [52; 42; 7; 9; 51] . R c values are all above unity, which indicates that these provinces should increase the control interventions to limit future COVID cases.",

The axes of these plots are given as average days from exposed to quarantine (1/\u03b3 1 ) and average days from starting of symptoms to isolation (1/\u03b3 2 ). For both cases, the contours show that, increasing \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 reduces the amount of control reproduction number R c and, therefore, COVID cases. For Hubei, using the parameters set from Table 1 , 2, 3, 4 and r Q = 0.3, we conclude that quarantine and isolation are not sufficient to control the outbreak (see Figure 6 (a) and 6(c)). With these parameter values, as \u03b3 1 increases, R c decreases and similarly, when \u03b3 2 increases, R c decreases. But, in the both cases R c > 1, and therefore the disease will persist in the population (i.e. the above control measures cannot lead to effective control of the epidemic). By contrast, our study shows that when the modification factor for quarantine become zero (so that r Q = 0), the outbreak can be controlled (see Figure  6 (b) and 6(d)). From the above finding it follows that neither the quarantine of exposed individuals nor the isolation of symptomatic individuals will prevent the disease with the high value of the modification factor for quarantine. This control can be obtained by a significant reduction in COVID transmission during quarantine (that is reducing rQ ).",

We observe that all the three parameters have significant effect on the cumulative outcome of the epidemic.

On the other hand Fig. 7(b) indicates, reduction in transmission rate will also slow down the epidemic significantly. These results point out that all the three control measures are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei.

Similarly from the figure 8(b) , it is clear that, isolation has positive level impact for r J < 0.715, whereas isolation has negative impact if r J > 0.715.

In this study, we have formulated and analyzed a compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated for the proposed model. It is also shown that whenever R 0 < 1, the DFE of the model without control is globally asymptotically stable. The efficacy of quarantine of exposed individuals and isolation of infected symptomatic individuals depends on the size of the modification parameter to reduce the infectiousness of exposed (r Q ) and isolated (r J ) individuals. The usage of quarantine and isolation will have positive population-level impact if r Q < r \u03b3 1 and r J < r \u03b3 2 respectively. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan. Using the parameter estimates, we then found the basic and control reproducton numbers for these five provinces. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread (R 0 > 1, R c > 1) is already present in all the five provinces. The estimates of control reproduction number indicate that sustained control interventions are necessary to reduce the future COVID cases. The health care agencies should focus on successful implementation of control mechanisms to reduce the burden of the disease.",
