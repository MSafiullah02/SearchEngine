In addition, the questionnaire was greatly expanded from the original to more thoroughly assess readiness for all biological events by incorporating measures outlined in recent Federal Emergency Management Agency11 and U.S. Department of Agriculture12 planning documents that did not exist when the 2011 study took place. Psychometric testing conducted on the instrument has been described previously.6 The questionnaire consisted of 72 items plus demographic questions. The following items were assessed: school disaster preparedness, school biological event preparedness, school having been or plan to be a point of dispensing (POD), stockpiling of infection prevention supplies, seasonal influenza vaccination policy for school personnel, and attitudes regarding school preparedness (eg, perceived preparedness, perceived importance of preparedness).",

Perfect attendance policies do not contribute to school preparedness because they could encourage ill individuals to go to school while contagious, which could contribute to disease spread.16 Similar to previous research,6 this study found that most K-12 schools are poorly prepared for biological events. On average, schools reported having less than half of the measured indicators of preparedness. This study greatly expanded on the single previous study6 that measured school readiness for pandemics. In particular, this study assessed school readiness for bioterrorism and outbreaks of emerging pathogens in addition to focusing on pandemics and found a general lack of preparedness for biological events. It is vital that schools become better prepared for all types of biological events. Just in the last year, the United States has experienced multiple outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases that have occurred primarily among school-aged children and young adults, including measles17 and mumps.18 Other outbreaks and biological events during the last year, such as the importation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola, have also had a strong impact on the United States, although less so on schools than health care agencies and public health. Should an outbreak of an emerging pathogen take hold in the United States, especially if it is a respiratory spread disease, it is likely that school settings will aid in disease transmission because of the close proximity of students.2, 19 It is vital that schools work toward better readiness for biological events.",

Interestingly, nurses reported equal agreement in the importance of school preparedness for both natural disasters and biological events. These findings indicate that although nurses believe it is important for the school to prepare for biological events, they correctly perceive that little is being done in this area to improve readiness. A general comparison between the similar 2011 school pandemic preparedness study6 and this study is useful because both compared 8 of the same biological event preparedness components. In both, schools were found to be lacking in all 8 categories at almost the same rate. For example, 56.3% of school nurses said they reported syndromic surveillance data to their local health department in the 2011 study,6 whereas 49.6% of nurses in this study indicated that their school reports syndromic surveillance data. Almost half (47.8%) of the nurses in the 2011 study reported that the school plan addresses pandemics,6 whereas 34.6% in the current study indicated that the school plan addresses all biological events, such as bioterrorism, pandemics, and emerging pathogens. These findings imply that Missouri schools do not appear to be making much progress for biological event preparedness.",

            "text": "The exact reasons why schools continue to lag in biological preparedness are unclear. Almost all nurses in this study reported that they are interested in school preparedness, and almost three-quarters indicated that they have time to receive this training. However, this study did not differentiate between nurses' interest in school preparedness for natural disasters versus biological events. It is possible that school nurses' interest in preparedness is only in the area of natural disasters or school-related violence and not biological events. One possible explanation is that nurses do not know how to better prepare their school for biological events or know where to obtain that information. Two past studies conducted in Missouri found that only 40% of nurses had received any bioterrorism training,20 83% had not participated in any bioterrorism scenario drills or exercises,20 and school nurses scored poorly on an objective assessment of bioterrorism-related knowledge.21 It is not known if the Missouri nurses who participated in the past bioterrorism-related studies also participated in this current study, but it is unlikely that the Missouri school nurse participants in this current study are significantly different from those in the previous studies. Therefore, Missouri school nurses' general lack of bioterrorism knowledge or participation in bioterrorism-related exercises and receipt of little to no bioterrorism training likely have an impact on schools' lag in biological preparedness, especially as it relates to bioterrorism preparedness. Schools can partner with public health to receive training on biological event preparedness. It is also possible that Missouri schools are better prepared than is reported in this study if the nurse participant was unfamiliar with the school plan and did not consult with a planner or administrator when completing the questionnaire. Future school preparedness studies should consider incorporating school administrators' awareness, knowledge, and perceptions related to biological event preparedness because these individuals can have great influence over disaster planning for the institution.",

For example, <10% of schools have a foodservice biosecurity plan, and only 1.5% address the unique psychological needs that accompany a bioterrorism attack. It is not known if nurses were unaware of the bioterrorism-specific needs for school disaster planning, if they do not know how to address these issues, or if the school disaster planning committee prioritizes other aspects of preparedness. Another possible explanation for the poor school biological event preparedness is that school administrators or school nurses may prioritize readiness for greater perceived threats, such as an active shooter, versus infectious diseases. Future studies need to examine this issue more closely to determine the reasons for the discrepancy between perceived importance for school biological disaster readiness and actual poor preparedness for these events. Studies using a qualitative methodology may be particularly useful to flesh out these issues.",

Numerous researchers have emphasized the important role schools will play in meeting student and staff psychological needs during and after disasters.22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Bioterrorism, in particular, is believed to pose unique psychological challenges because of the nature of such an event: the uncertainty of contaminated areas or human exposures after a covert release and the potential for disease spread if a contagious agent is used.23, 26 For example, mass panic was experienced in multiple schools in the weeks after the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism attack.26 Children and adolescents are at increased risk for severe illness and post-traumatic stress disorder after a bioterrorism attack, and they spend >80% of their waking hours at school.25 Researchers have also asserted that school nurses need to be able to identify students needing referral for treatment to address the psychological effects of a bioterrorism attack.24 For all of theses reasons, it is essential that schools address the psychological needs of students and staff as part of disaster planning, especially as it relates to biological events. School disaster plans need to be coordinated with mental health professionals. This is likely to be most challenging for elementary schools that often do not have counseling staff on-site. It would be prudent for schools to partner with local public health agencies or mental health community-based organizations that can assist with development of plans to address students' psychological needs.",

Although this is higher than participation rates reported in a 2005 study,24 it still means that half of the nurses in this study are not part of their school planning committee. Researchers27 and the National Association of School Nurses28 have asserted that it is vital that school nurses be involved in school disaster planning activities. School nurses are often key health care providers to children and adolescents during routine times and are expected to play a major role in pediatric health if a biological disaster should occur.24 School nurses are also more likely than school administrators to have knowledge about how to prevent disease transmission in the school setting, a vital skill for biological event planning and response. Participation in the school disaster planning committee may also have benefits for the school nurse in the form of higher perceived readiness to respond to a biological event. A 2004 study reported that years of work experience were associated with higher school nurses' perceived readiness to respond to a biological event.29 That association was not found in this study, but being a member of the disaster planning committee was associated with a higher perceived personal readiness to respond to a pandemic and a higher perceived school preparedness for natural disasters. The 2004 study did not assess participation in school planning committees; therefore, it is not known whether those nurses' work experience included being on a planning committee or not. Regardless, the current study's findings suggest school nurse involvement in school planning has personal and institutional benefits. Interestingly, there was no association between school nurse involvement in school planning and perceived interest in disaster planning or perceived importance of school readiness for natural disasters or biological events. This implies that there may be more opportunities for school nurses to be involved in school planning, something that would benefit the individual and the school. This study found an association between being a member of the school planning committee and perceived administrative support to be involved. Dedicated time for disaster planning would be essential for school nurses to be involved. A potential future intervention would be to increase awareness among school administrators regarding the need and benefits of involving school nurses in school disaster planning.",

Furthermore, even in the rare situation of a school having a mandatory vaccination policy, nurses are the only school staff to whom the policy applies. No other school staff are mandated to get vaccinated, and about half of all school volunteers are neither mandated nor encouraged to get vaccinated. These findings are not in line with the Healthy People 2020 goal of having 80% of nonhealth care professional adults and 90% of health care professionals receive the influenza vaccine annually.31 Immunization of school staff against seasonal influenza and other vaccine preventable diseases should be a priority for school districts. This protects not only the school staff from disease, but also reduces sick leave32 and minimizes disease spread even in nonhospital settings.33 School administrators should consider implementing a mandatory vaccination policy for nurses and, at a minimum, encourage all other staff to get immunized. Research indicates that having a mandatory vaccination policy and encouraging workers to get vaccinated have a significant impact on vaccine uptake.30, 34, 35 This would be a simple and cost-effective method of improving school preparedness for biological events. One option for increasing seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among school personnel would be to host a school-based immunization clinic. Past research6 indicates that schools that are planned POD sites, which could include being a vaccine clinic, were more prepared for pandemics than non-POD school sites.",

A few limitations must also be noted. One limitation is that only schools in Missouri were assessed and only those whose nurse belongs to the MASN were invited to participate. Therefore, findings from this study may not be generalizable to all of Missouri or the United States. Only a small number of Missouri school nurses are MASN members, perhaps because of time and cost restrictions; therefore, the findings from this study may be biased toward better-funded schools that cover nurses' MASN membership costs or nurses who prioritize MASN membership who might not be representative of the state as a whole. Second, there may be some responder bias. Characteristics of the nonresponders could not be assessed, a common limitation in survey research. It is likely that nurse respondents were more interested or involved in disaster planning compared with those who chose not to participate. This means that the findings could overestimate school preparedness and affect reported attitudes toward disaster planning assessed in this study. In addition, results pertaining to interest in, and perceived importance of, disaster planning may be artificially inflated because of social desirability bias.",

Infectious disease disaster planning among Missouri schools does not appear to have progressed much over the last 4 years since a similar nationwide study was conducted, and most Missouri schools are not meeting many national and professional organization recommendations and guidelines. The United States continues to experience infectious disease outbreaks and importation of emerging pathogens; schools must be prepared to implement control measures to prevent disease transmission in the school setting. Findings from this study and previous studies6, 29 and national recommendations11, 12 indicate that school nurses should be involved in school planning efforts because these professionals have the knowledge and clinical skills needed for infectious disease disaster planning.",
