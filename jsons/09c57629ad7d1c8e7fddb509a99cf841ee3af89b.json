The level of PEEP should maintain recruitment and ventilation should suit the individual level of lung injury. With the help of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) the regional effect of ventilation can be monitored at bedside (1). The aim of our study was to investigate the ability of EIT to detect changes of regional compliance due to an incremental and decremental PEEP trial in experimental ARDS.",

During the PEEP trial subjects were ventilated pressure controlled (PCV, \u22068 cm H2O, respiratory rate 25, I:E 1:1, FiO2 1.0). Global ventilatory, hemodynamic and gas exchange parameters were continuously recorded. To investigate regional ventilation EIT and CT scans were realized simultaneously at a juxtadiaphragmatic thoracic level. Two non-dependent and two dependent regions of interest were defined in the tomograms. By calculating the difference of functional EIT images between different PEEP levels regional compliance (\u2206 VT) can be displayed. Nonparametric tests were used, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

In patients after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, BGL were measured hourly until BGL were within the normoglycemia range for 4 hours, afterwards 2 hourly measurements were continued. If the target range was exceeded, an hourly measurement was restarted until blood glucose levels returned to target values. Data were collected during a maximum of 24 hours in ICU.

BCPAP was generated with heliox 50/50 at a flow rate of 15-30 L/min. Previous laboratory testing had shown that heliox 50/50 could generate CPAP of 5 cm H2O. The disposable plastic BCPAP device directly was connected to a standard facemask. Patient acceptation, complications and outcome were recorded.",

To prevent liver damage from acetaminophen being a significant metabolite of aniline, the patient was started on intravenous acetylcysteine and silibinin immediately after arrival (acetaminophen levels were 32.9 mg/L then). With a latency of 18-24 hrs after intoxication, the patient destabilized and developed acute respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, and he was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration and ciprofloxacin/tazobactam-piperacillin. Within 5 days, the patient was weaned off to non-invasive, assisted ventilation using a mask. Finally, 15 days after the intoxication, the patient was fully oriented and cooperative. Despite persisting anuria, the general condition of the patient improved during the following days, and he was transferred back to the referring hospital 21 days after intoxication. Hemodialysis was discontinued 34 days, and the patient was discharged 45 days after the attempted suicide.",

Measurement of cardiac output (CO) in the cardiac surgical environment is important for management. A number of methods are commonly used ranging in complexity, accuracy and invasiveness. However there remains a need for a non-invasive alternative, particularly in children.

NAS (Nursing Activity Store) is a workload expression system based on attending times, expressed as percentages of FTE (full time equivalents) needed for caring patients admitted to ICUs. So, one nurse can not cope with more than 100 NAS points during one shift. Our aim has been to assess the different workloads linked to admission diagnosis or other circumstances not related to diagnosis. During 2005 During , 1069 consecutive patients were admitted to our ICU. Admission diagnoses were classified according to FRICE IRS 1.0. Circumstances not related to admission diagnosis were infection detected after ICU admission (92 cases), isolation procedures (71), intermediate care attention (255), and intraICU death (165). Patients attendance processes were evaluated by NAS, expressing results as NAS 1 (first day workload), NAS TOT (whole stay and NAS PRO (daily average). Length of stay (LOS) and NAS were expressed as for days.",

Statistics analysis of data (mean and standard deviation, \u00b1 2) were performed and chi2 were used to compare mortality and coagulation variables in patients with Japanese, ISTH, and Helsinki DIC score. Statistic differences between coagulation variables were determined by independent t-test. The statistical analysis was carried out with the SPSS 10 package, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

The questionnaire was passed for evaluating psychological situation before admission, 48 hours after admission or after being extubated, one week after ICU transfer and 6 months after hospital discharge. before admission (after personal contact, this phase was runned by phone or even via mail). CUBIS results were correlated with the ones obtained from Barthel test. During 2005 During , 1069 patients were admitted to our ICU. Out of them, 531 remained more than 48 hours. We got informed consent from 105 of them, fully followed 6 months after discharge. CUBIS lower score (highest psychological disturbance) was registered during ICU stay and coincides with family and nursing perception of the patient' situation. Recovery began after ICU discharge, but 6 months after hospital discharge, patient's mood had not recover to the pre -admission levels. This profile is quite similar to the one offered by Barthel evaluation.",

At our Intensive Care Units (ICU), the insertion of arterial catheters (AC) allows us a constant measurement of intra-arterial blood pressure and extraction of samples for analytical purposes. Although the AC manufacturer does not suggest the use of heparin (Hep) for its maintenance nor it is indicated in the brochure of this drug, it is an habitual practice to use it at low doses to this goal. Objective: To analyze the action of Hep versus saline serum (SS) in the maintenance of the AC regarding duration, functionality and analytical coagulation results.",

Our aim was to study the reasons for admitting SLE patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) and their outcomes during an 11-year period.METHODS.A retrospective study held in our 10-bed ICU, between Jan.1991-Jan.2002. Medical files of 20 ICU patients with SLE according to the revised criteria of the American Rheumatism Association were reviewed. Parameters recorded were demographic details, clinical signs and symptoms, SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE II), medical treatment, events during ICU stay, and outcomes.CONCLUSION.To conclude, the main reasons for life threatening events and ICU admission were infection and bleeding. The main cause of death was sepsis with MOF. APACHE II score was not a reliable predictor for a bad outcome.

Hospitalario de Palencia, Palencia, SpainINTRODUCTION.There is growing interest in describing patterns and rhythms of biological systems and their variability in physiological and pathological states. The goal of the present study is measuring breathing pattern variability (BPV) by calculating Sample Entropy (SampEn) of several parameters so to settle its pronostic usefulness during weaning. Similarities or differences with healthy subjects BPV were also sought METHODS. Intubated critical patients on MV > 48 h and a group of non-intubated healthy volunteers were included. A variable orifice pneumotachograph connected to a breathing monitoring system (Bicore CP-100) were used. Values captured this way were recorded and saved using a computer software program. Patients underwent a 30 min O2T trial. The following variables were gathered breath-tobreath (both from patients and volunteers): inspired and expired tidal volume (Vti), (Vte); respiratory rate (RR); inspiratory fraction (Ti/Ttot); peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rate (PIFR) (PEFR). The following study groups were obtained: CG (control group): tests conducted on healthy volunteers; SG (succeed group): tests on patients who underwent disconnection and successful extubation; FG (failure group): tests on patients who underwent tests not followed by extubation or who needed reintubation < 48 h; and IG: tests on all intubated patients. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney or Student's t-tests. p<.05 indicated significance RESULTS. 15 healthy volunteers (CG=15) and 40 patients were included. 51 disconnection tests were conducted (IG=51): SG=26; FG=25. SG versus FG: No significant differences were found in BPV. SampEn Vti and SampEn Vte revealed higher values in FG than in SG almost reaching statistical significance(Table 1). IG versus CG: higher SampEn values were obtained in all parameters in CG; differences in SampEn Ti/Ttot, PIFR, and PEFR reached statistical significance(Table 2)CONCLUSION. SampEn PIFR, PEFR and Ti/Ttot revealed higher values in healthy volunteers than in intubated patients. BPV showed differences, but has not been useful in distinguishing successful from failed weaning.SLEEP QUALITY IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS: COMPARISON OF THREE VENTILATORY MODESCabello B 1 , Thille A 2 , Drouot X 3 , GaliaF 2 , Mancebo J 1 , D'Ortho M 3 , Brochard L 2 1 Servicio de Medicina Intensiva, Hospital Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain, 2 Service de R\u00e9animation m\u00e9dicale, 3 Service de Physiologie-Explorations Fonctionnelles, AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France INTRODUCTION.

The main alterations were a diminished percentage of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep accounting for 10 [2-13]%, and a high index of fragmentation with 29 [19-41] arousals and awakenings per hour. Restorative sleep time was longer during the first part of the night, 62 [17-86] minutes and REM percentage was higher during the last night period, 13 [2-26]%. The duration of restorative sleep and the percentage of REM were similar through the three ventilatory modes,CONCLUSION.Sleep architecture is markedly altered in assisted mechanical ventilated patients due to a diminished REM stage (N=15-25%) and a high index of fragmentation (N<10). The ventilatory mode, in the way it was adjusted through this study, does not seem to influence sleep quality.Grant acknowledgement. B.

In several countries midazolam or diazepam are the main drugs of choice for urgent procedures. There are no randomized trials comparing midazolam and diazepam for urgent orotracheal intubation. A clinical equivalence would allow physicians to choose between the agents on a cost basis. The aim of the study is to compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the two drugs.METHODS.Thirty-three patients over 18 yr old undergoing urgent intubation were randomized to either diazepam or midazolam for intravenous sedation.

We registered the demographic data, organic disfunction and infection characteristics. Statistical analysis performed by SPSS 12.0.RESULTS.We included 95 patients, median age of 64 years (P25:54, P75: 71), 82 men (86%) and 13 women (14%), median length of ICU stay of 4 days (P25: 2, P75: 8), median length of hospital stay 21 days (P25: 15, P75: 34), ICU mortality 6/95 (6%), total mortality 10/95 (10.5%). Hemodinamic failure was observed in 43/95 (45%), respiratory failure in 27/95 (28%) and renal failure 8/95 (8%). Infection, as positive cultures, was documented in 46/95 patients (48%). The first infection was diagnosed on day 7.5\u00b14.7 and the second on day 12.7\u00b18. The principal focuses were infection of the cervicotomy (37%), respiratory tract (30%), urinary tract (11%), primary bacteriemia (6.5%) and others (15%). The etiology was: P. aeruginosa 17.4%, E. coli 13%, meticillin-sensible S. aureus (MSSA) 11%, meticillinresistent Staphilococcus aureus (MRSA) 11%, Enterobacter sp. 11% and S. pneumoniae 11%. A second infection was detected in 8/95 patients (8.4%). There were 14/46 (30%) of early-onset infections and 32/46 (70%) of late-onset infections. The most frequent early-onset focus was the respiratory tract, and infection of the cervicotomy for the late-onset focus (p<0.002). The etiolgy for early-onset infection was: E.coli 21.4%, H. influenzae 21.4%, P. aeruginosa 14.3%, Citrobacter sp.14.3% and S. pneumoniae 14.3%. For late infection: P. aeruginosa 19%, MSSA 15.6%, MRSA 15.6% and Enterobacter sp. 15.6%.CONCLUSION. The most frequent complications in postoperative esophagectomy for neoplasia are infection, hemodinamic and respiratory disfunction. When an early-onset infection is suspected we should first think about respiratory focus, and cover Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. In the presence of a late-onset infection, the focus is mainly surgical, and the suspected etiology are P. aeruginosa, MRSA and other nosocomial agents. REFERENCE(S). Law S.

Bispectral (BIS) index monitoring could be sensitive to the nociceptive stimuli experienced by critically ill patients. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an intravenous fentanyl and propofol on the variation in BIS level associated with tracheal suction, a stimulus often reported as particularly painful by critically ill patients.",

Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a novel imaging technology that measures vibration energy emitted during the ventilation process. The vibrations are detected and displayed by 34 sensors, which are spatially distributed and attached to a patient's back. As air moves in and out of the lungs, the vibrations propagate through the lung tissue and the vibration energy is transmitted to the VRI device and a dynamic digital image is created using proprietary software. The VRI provides an opportunity to observe the effects of different ventilator modes on the geographical distribution of lung vibration during ventilation.METHODS.Stable, mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU requiring minimal ventilatory support were identified. Serial VR imaging was performed on 26 patients during volume control (VC with square inspiration), pressure control (PC) and pressure support (PS) modes of mechanical ventilation. Tidal volume was held constant (pressure adjustant with PC and PS) control. Geographical area of VRI images was measured at maximal inspiration using digital software. Statistical analysis was done using t-test.RESULTS.Compared to VC, area of vibration as a surrogate of ventilation were greater for PC (p<0.000001) and PS (p<0.0001) (figure 1).CONCLUSION. Spatial distribution of vibration in the lungs at maximal inspiration energy was significantly greater in PC and PS compared to VC modes of ventilation. Decelerating flow patterns in both PC and PS modes may provide greater distribution of ventilation of the lungs, as observed at the bedside using VR imaging.ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN CRITICAL ILL PA-TIENTSMourelo Fari\u00f1a M M 1 , Pastor Benavent J A 1 , Boutureira Toja L 1 , Fern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez C J 1 , Hurtado Doce A I 1 ,\u00c1lvarez Lata R 1 , Aldama L\u00f3pez G 2 1 Intensive Care Medicine, 2 Cardiology, University Hospital Juan Canalejo, La Coru\u00f1a, SpainINTRODUCTION.The echocardiography in critical ill patient is used like bedside imaging technique for a rapid control of the cardiovascular system. The aim of this report is review the utility of the transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TOE) echocardiography.METHODS.We make 280 random echocardiographies studies (213 TTE and 67 TOE) in the period of six months to 216 patients admitted to polyvalent intensive care unit (ICU) with 24 beds. The studies were realizad with a Phillips 5000 echocardiography: harmonic transducer S3 for TTE and TS6HC transducer for TOE. A descriptive study was performed for analyse the profitability diagnostic, adopt therapeutic decisions with the two echocardiography modalities (TTE and TOE) and the quelity of the images in both studies. Profitability diagnostic: reject or confirm the diagnostic.RESULTS.The population of study were composed of: 74.5% medical pathology, 21% traumatic patients, 4% cardiology pathology and 0.5% surgery patients. The quality of images studies were good in 63 TOE and 179 TTE (94% and 84% respectively). The profitability diagnostic in the TOE was 86.5% (confirm 34.3%; rejected 52.5%) and 62% in the TTE (corroborated 25.8%; reject 36.2%). The reasons to realize the echocardiography in the patients were: Fever / Bacteriemia in the 36.4% cases, 15.7% respiratory failure, 6% hemodynamic monitoring and 7% thoracic injury. The therapeutic management changed according to the result of echocardiography in the 34.3% of the TOE and 27.2% of the TTE.CONCLUSION.We observed a more quelity in the images obtained with the TOR than TTE, but the TTE has a good profitability diagnostic. In the 27% of TTE and 35% of TOE are useful for the therapeutic management. The 56% of TTE were a good techique for hemodynamic monitoring.Grant acknowledgement.

The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be difficult.The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) has developed a diagnostic scoring system to diagnose DIC with basic coagulation parameters. This scoring system is defined solely for patients with clinical conditions associated with DIC. For overt DIC, this system relies on platelet count, prothrombin time (PTT), fibrinogen and D-dimer concentration. For each parameter, the cutoff points were arbitrarily chosen. We investigated the distribution of values for these parameters in critically ill patients without DIC in order to develop specific cut-off values for this population.METHODS.We conducted a prospective cohort study in a 18 bed closed format tertiary referral general ICU in a teaching hospital. For 1 month, daily blood samples were drawn from all patients to determine platelet count, PTT, fibrinogen and D-dimer concentration. A panel of experts determined the presence or absence of DIC.RESULTS.The panel concluded absence of DIC in 121 patients, while ISTH overt DIC scores were >=5 indicating overt DIC in 3 (2.2%) samples in patients with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia, massive hemorrhage and cardiogenic shock. 39 out of 121 patients had clinical conditions associated",

Bleeding is not the most important parameter to neither define mortality nor define diagnostic of DIC on septic patients with coagulation abnormalities. We demonstrated reduction in some coagulation factor important to stimulate the activation of procoagulant enzymes activated on sepsis. It is may be more important to know DIC score, levels of FVII, protein C, FX, PT to detect the patients who need any therapeutic option (FFP).

There are different regimens for IIT but all require frequent measurements of blood glucose. Frequent blood sampling has been recognised as a significant contributor to anaemia on the intensive care unit and we therefore wished to assess the impact of IIT on Hb and blood transfusion requirements.METHODS. Data were extracted from the records of patients enrolled in a recent dual-centre trial of ITT based at Addenbrookes Hospital (AH) Cambridge and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) King's Lynn, ethical approval granted. There were two regimens for blood sampling; in the first unit (QEH) a protocol is in use which limits the volume of wastage when blood is drawn from an arterial line, uses minimum amounts for the sample and returns blood within the line to the patient. In addition only finger prick samples were used for the measurement of blood glucose. The second unit (AH) had no protocol for blood sampling and commonly used Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) samples to measure blood glucose. Hepatology patients were excluded for the purposes of this analysis as this group represent a tertiary referral service of AH which is not reflected at QEH and this group could also be expected to have significantly disturbed glucose control as well as a significantly higher transfusion requirement.

Compared to controls IL-18 serum levels were significantly higher in stroke (p<0.001) and septic (p<0.02) patients. In septic patients IL-18 levels were significantly higher than in stroke patients (p<0.05).CONCLUSION. IL-18 has shown to be upregulated in several diseases and it represents an important marker in monitoring severe inflammatory conditions. IL-18 upregulation, in the early phase after stroke, might mean a IL-18-mediated inflammatory response to brain injury. In our series high serum levels of IL-18 are not associated with adverse neurological outcome. ",

Nurse-driven protocols are known to lead to more efficient glucose control in the intensive care unit than doctors' decisions. Potassium regulation has important similarities with glucose control: potassium can be measured in the same blood sample and on the same machine as glucose, potassium can also be delivered by syringe pump and potassium administration may need multiple readjustments over the day. Therefore, we integrated potassium control into an automated computer program, which had already been successfully implemented for glucose control [1] .",

Overall mortality was 57% and 67% at 28 and 90-day with no between group difference. The MV parameters differed between groups: TV and I/E were significantly higher in ACP+ (respectively 9.7 \u00b1 2.8 vs 8.6 \u00b1 1.8 ml/cmH20 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 ml/cmH20) while PEEPtot was not different.

By contrast, PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, Compliance and SvO2 were independently associated with mortality.CONCLUSION. Around 10 percent of ARDS patients developed ACP, which has no influence on outcome. The heart-lung interactions induced by MV could explain the onset of ACP. In patients suffering from ARDS and hemodynamic disorders, SvO2 monitoring could be recommended to adapt MV modalities. It is likely that MV induced ACP will totally disappear in a brief future with the widely use of low TV strategy. ",

TEE was also performed when vasopressors were stopped (Day n: 7\u00b14). Following echocardiographic parameters were measured (mean of 3 end-expiratory measurements): LV end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic (LVESV) volumes by Simpson's rule (S) and area-length method (A-L), stroke volume (SV) by Doppler, early diastolic blood flow propagation velocity with color M-mode (Vp), and early tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) velocities (Ea) of the mitral ring.

This study showed that (1) LV systolic dysfunction is frequent (46%) at the acute phase of septic shock in fluid loaded patients under vasopressors, (2) initial true LV dilatation is uncommon, and (3) LV diastolic dysfunction seems to be frequent.

The indications were gastroparesis (23), pancreatitis (8) and recurrent aspirations (2). 2/3 of the patients were mechanically ventilated. The duration of the insertion procedure was median 20 minutes (min 6, max 125 min). The time from the decision to place the tube until the start of enteral feeding was median 117 minutes (min 26, max 402 min). The success rate was 94% (31/33). In the 2 unsuccessful cases a gastroenterlogist had to place the tubes endoscopically. The most frequent problem delaying the procedure was a difficult pyloric passage (14/33). There was no association between the specific indication, especially pancreatitis and introduction difficulties (p=0.733, Fisher exact). Further, here was no correlation between time to nutrition start and nursing workload (R=0.14, p=0.49). We observed no adverse events.CONCLUSION. Fluoroscopic placement of a jejunal feeding tube at the bedside is fast, safe and has a high success rate when performed by well-trained ICU staff. It makes the ICU team more self sufficient when enteral nutrition in critical patients needs to be started and no gastroenterology service is available around the clock. ",

For the sake of reducing the risk of the surgical complications we used modified version of the standard Ciaglia teqnique (MVCT), proofed to be efficient in adult population. The main features of the MVCT included:1. Bronchoscope -an external D of the bronchoscope should not exceed 4 mm. The endoscopy was performed discretely, no longer than 15-30 sec each time; 2. Endotracheal intubation tube -played a part of an internal frame of the trachea throughout the puncture and insertion of the guide wire; 3. Mild lateral compression of the trachea throughout the puncture -facilitation of the puncture itself, reduced risk of posterior tracheal wall trauma; 4. The negative pressure in the syringe during the whole period of puncture -allows to identify tracheal puncture as earlier as possible.",

The MVCT of the PDT can be performed in the population of pediatric patients starting from the age of 5 years, providing that the minimal inner diameter of the intubation tube is not less than 5-5.5mm. The other two indispensable conditions to support the safety of the procedure are the sufficient experience of the operator and all of the necessary means and capability for the urgent switch to the surgical tracheostomy Grant acknowledgement.

Immunofluorescence antigen detection in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal secretions was used for virus identification.RESULTS. 84 patients (mean age : 66.4 \u00b1 52.5 days), accounting for 3.6 of admissions in the PICU, had a RSV infection. Twenty two of them (26.2%) were under 28 days of age, 12 (14.3%) had a history of premature birth (gestational age < 32 weeks) and 12 (14.3%) developed a respiratory distress at birth. A cardiac or pulmonary coexisting disease was identified in 14 patients (16.7%) (congenital heart disease : 8, bronchopulmonary dysplasia : 3, cystic fibrosis disease : 3). Three types of clinical manifestations were identified: obstructive form (78.6%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (8.3%) and recurrent apnea (13.1%). Eighty three childrens (98.8%) required MV. Eight of them (9.6%) required high frequency oscillation ventilation. One patient was managed with nasal CPAP. Hyponatr\u00e9mia (<125 mmol/l) was the major complication (48.8%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis, showed that length of MV >7 days (OR = 4.7; 95% CI 1.8 -12; p < 0.001) and a PaCO2 > 70 mmHg (OR = 3.3; 95% CI 1.6 -4.8; p < 0.05) were independent risk factors for occurence of hyponatremia.

The clinical course of RDS in the newborns who were treated with ambroxol differed on more rapid achievement of optimal oxygenation and ventilation values. 18 (71%) newborns treated with ambroxol survived versus 7 (26%) infants in the control group (p<0.05). In the treatment group there were no cases of pulmonary haemorrhage as compared with 11 (43%) cases in the control group (p<0.01), persistent pulmonary hypertension as compared with 8 (30%) cases (p<0.05), and patent ductus arteriosus in comparison with 3 (13%) cases in the control group (p>0.05). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was about 4 times less comparing with the control group (6% versus 26%; p>0.05). The incidences of pneumothorax and intraventricular haemorrhage were similar in the both groups. Administration of ambroxol facilitated extubation of larger number of newborns (67% versus 45%; p>0.05). Among survived infants the total duration of respiratory support was significantly shorter in neonates treated with ambroxol -127.9 (42.24) hrs versus 257.02 (98.23) hrs (p<0.05).",

The main reasons for admission to ICU were loss of consciousness and need for mechanical ventilation. Toxic agents involved in ICU treated cases were drugs (57.4%), carbon monoxide (10.6%), toxic plants (6.4%), household chemicals (4.3%), alcohol (4.3%). Toxic agent was not established in 17% of ICU admissions. Poisoning Severity Score on admission to ICU was PSS=2 (27.6%) and PSS=3 (70.2%). 18 patients (38.3%) required endotracheal intubation and mean intubation time was 7.9 h (\u00b1 6.92 h). Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 5.5 h (\u00b1 4.7 h). ICU treatment was shorter than 24 hours in 39 patients (83%). Out of this number 25 patients (53%) did not present any signs of poisoning, 16 patients (34.1%) presented mild and 2 patients (4.3%) moderate symptoms after 24 hours of hospitalisation. After 24 hours of ICU treatment severe symptoms of poisoning were observed in 2 (4.3%) patients. We reported 2 deaths (4.3%) in first 24 hours after admission. Intensive treatment for longer than 24 hours was necessary in 8 patients (1% of poisoning cases, 17% treated in ICU). Next 2 patients, who presented severe symptoms after 24 hours of stay in ICU, died eventually due to multiorgan failure. Mean ICU length of stay was 1.95 day (\u00b1 0.59), and hospitalization lasted 4.40 days (\u00b1 1.79).",
