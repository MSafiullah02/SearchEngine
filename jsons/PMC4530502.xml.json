They are also part of the intricate network of the craniofacial mucosal immune system. This system shares many properties with other mucosa\u2010associated lymphoid tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues, but is also quite distinct in terms of cellular requirements for organogenesis and mucosal imprinting molecules [reviewed in Ref. 136]. Oral mucosa\u2010associated lymphoid tissue must deal with the continuous onslaught of bacteria, in which the number of colonizing bacteria far exceeds the number of host cells per surface area 48. Because of this bacterial load, humans have evolved different biological mechanisms to tolerate commensal bacteria whilst preventing invasion with pathogenic bacteria. However, in some instances, the human immune response is not up to the task, being unable to maintain the delicate balance needed between tolerance and protection. Consequently, the host becomes more susceptible to the long\u2010term effects of disruption of immune homeostasis that is manifest by several autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, including periodontal disease 162.",

Tissue \u2018resident\u2019 dendritic cells, namely Langerhans cells or interstitial dendritic cells, have relatively long lifespans and play an active role in immune surveillance, promoting host tolerance or immunity. However, nearly 50% of the dendritic cells found in these tissues are migratory dendritic cell subsets, rather than typical resident dendritic cells. Circulating blood dendritic cells are distinguished from tissue dendritic cells in that they neither show dendrite formation nor express maturation features (such as CD83) 185. Because blood dendritic cells lack lineage\u2010specific markers, such as CD3, CD14, CD19, CD56 and glycophorin A, they are generally isolated by negative selection 156, 170, 172. Blood dendritic cells can be divided into three general dendritic cell types \u2013 plasmacytoid dendritic cells and two types of conventional or myeloid dendritic cells (CD1c+ or CD141+) \u2013 based on function and phenotype 56, 84, 185. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are derived from lymphoid progenitors and resemble plasma cells; however, plasmacytoid dendritic cells share more commonalities with myeloid dendritic cells. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are commonly identified by expression of CD123, CD303 and CD304, and they also strongly express toll\u2010like receptors 7 and 9 and can produce high amounts of interferon\u2010alpha in response to C\u2010phosphate\u2010G bacterial DNA motifs (but not to bacterial lipopolysaccharide) 168. Therefore, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are thought to recognize predominantly viral antigens 30, 68. Myeloid dendritic cells, on the other hand, are highly phagocytic, antigen\u2010processing dendritic cells that recognize both bacterial and viral antigens 116, 155. Myeloid dendritic cells can be characterized by their expression of CD1c+ (BDCA\u20101+) or CD141+. CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells express all toll\u2010like receptors (except toll\u2010like receptor\u20109), whereas CD141+ myeloid dendritic cells express a more restricted pattern of toll\u2010like receptors, limited to toll\u2010like receptor\u20103 and toll\u2010like receptor\u201010, suggesting a more specific role in antiviral immunity 84. Recent studies have revealed an important role for blood myeloid dendritic cells in responding to periodontal infection (Tables 1 and 2).",

Myeloid dendritic cells show such a degree of plasticity that some subsets can even serve as osteoclast precursors and have a role in osteoclastogenesis 2, 144. Myeloid dendritic cells are normally present at very low abundance in the blood (below ~1% of all circulating leukocytes). A rise (or fall) in the number of blood myeloid dendritic cells is often a hallmark of underlying chronic inflammatory/infectious disease; as such, blood myeloid dendritic cells have been called the \u2018canary in the coal mine\u2019 of these diseases 123. Most myeloid dendritic cells predominantly function within the confines of the tissues, mucosa\u2010associated lymphoid tissue, lymphatics and secondary lymphoid organs. Myeloid dendritic cells typically exhibit short lifespans (especially after activation), as well as the need for constant replenishing. Myeloid dendritic cells can rapidly mobilize, when needed, in response to hematopoietic factors (such as fms\u2010related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand) 92, 98. In a normal physiologic state of immune homeostasis, myeloid dendritic cells constantly undergo influx to and efflux from mucosal tissues; however, in pathophysiologic states of infection, the total number of blood myeloid dendritic cells can significantly increase 23, 123. Whether this is a consequence of active mobilization of epidermal Langerhans cells and lamina propria myeloid dendritic cells from, for example, periodontally infected tissues to the blood, increased dendritic cell differentiation from progenitors, decreased apoptosis 121 or reduced homing to secondary lymphoid organs 122, is speculative. From a histopathological context, the number of Langerhans cells decreases in the gingival epithelium in both gingivitis and periodontitis, apparently by efflux through the basement membrane. In contrast, the number of myeloid dendritic cells increases in the lamina propria in periodontitis, where they form immune conjugates with CD4+ T\u2010cells, called oral lymphoid foci in situ (Table 1).",

In vitro, this is dependent on the presence of recombinant granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor and interleukin\u20104 for differentiation into monocyte\u2010derived dendritic cells 8, 99, 137, 182 and on the presence of granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor, interleukin\u20104 and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 for differentiation into Langerhans cells 65. These \u2018canonical\u2019 monocyte\u2010derived dendritic cells and Langerhans cells are similar, in many ways, to typical myeloid dendritic cells 25, 65, 108, thus facilitating the study of their functions despite a low abundance in physiological conditions 107. When the host encounters microbial/proinflammatory signals in an infected site, CCR2+ blood monocytes can rapidly migrate and then differentiate into distinct populations of myeloid dendritic cells 27, 66. Toll\u2010like receptor recognition and stimulation seems to be particularly influential in \u2018noncanonical\u2019 differentiation of monocytes into CD209+ CD16+ or CD1b/c+ monocyte\u2010derived dendritic cells 102. However, such increases in the population of myeloid dendritic cells do not necessarily lead to efficient immune responses; in fact, the resultant pool of myeloid dendritic cells can be \u2018immunoincompetent\u2019 in some cases. Such a phenomenon is found particularly during chronic, low\u2010grade infections and it is also associated with faulty pathogen\u2010elimination and antigen\u2010presentation processes; this may further exacerbate the immune dysregulation observed in chronic inflammatory diseases 123.",

The biofilm composition is eventually transformed by an increase in the numbers of certain pathogens. The host response to this biofilm ultimately leads to destruction of soft and hard tissue 24, 40. This involves the release, by local neutrophils and mast cells, of vasoactive peptides (via tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1), resulting in the secretion of inflammatory mediators by resident cells of the gingival tissue (fibroblasts); moreover, invading immune cells \u2018amplify\u2019 the local immune response, particularly polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other myeloid inflammatory cells that are increasingly recruited into tissues via diapedesis, in a process facilitated by vasodilation.

The myeloid dendritic cells in the gingival lamina propria typically express the C\u2010type lectin and the pattern recognition receptor, dendritic cell\u2010specific intercellular adhesion molecule\u20103\u2010grabbing nonintegrin (DC\u2010SIGN or CD209), which is used as an invasin by a broad range of pathogenic organisms 45, 115, 119, 159. In the case of P. gingivalis, the 67\u2010kDa minor fimbrial adhesin (denoted mfa\u20101) is expressed, which is glycosylated and targets the dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin, DC\u2010SIGN, for entry into myeloid dendritic cells 181. This interaction has also been shown to drive myeloid dendritic cell function away from maturation, leading to low expression of accessory molecules and a more immunosuppressive cytokine\u2010production profile 179 (Table 1). Owing to their pronounced migratory function, immature status and weak bactericidal mechanisms, myeloid dendritic cells in blood may be particularly susceptible to exploitation by invasive pathogens. For example, In 2014 in vitro findings of our laboratory show that P. gingivalis, through its manipulation of DC\u2010SIGN\u2013toll\u2010like receptor\u20102 signaling, rapidly induces differentiation of dendritic cells from monocyte progenitors. These dendritic cells, which we termed \u2018pathogen\u2010differentiated\u2019 dendritic cells, are CD1c+ CD209+ CD14\u2212, but immature in phenotype and function unless forced to mature with an inflammatory cocktail 121. In addition, the P. gingivalis\u2013dendritic cell interaction further dysregulates homeostasis by driving cells toward an aberrant chemokine receptor profile. These pathogen\u2010differentiated dendritic cells display poor secondary lymphoid\u2010organ homing capabilities 122 that prevent efficient effector cell responses. Hence, the generation of noncanonical pathogen\u2010differentiated dendritic cells may have implications for pathogen dissemination and immune subversion in the low\u2010grade transient bacteremia and chronic inflammation scenarios observed in periodontal diseases.",

            "text": "Targeting host cells is a fundamental step in viral infection by which viruses translocate their genome into host cells. Accordingly, two main factors are crucial in understanding such a process: (i) how viruses translocate their genomes into the target cell cytoplasm; and (ii) how the virus reaches the \u2018remote\u2019 targeted cells after initial entry. Studying the interactions of dendritic cells with viruses could provide clues on these two aspects of viral disease pathogenesis. As the main immune sentinels, many viruses target dendritic cells for direct propagation or systemic dissemination. Several phenotypic and functional subsets of dendritic cells are found in the peripheral tissues 185. The distinction of these subtypes is based mainly on the expression of pattern\u2010recognition receptors, such as toll\u2010like receptors and specific lectins for detecting high\u2010mannose glycan motifs, at their surface. Differential receptor expression define the maturation state of dendritic cells, and subsequently their function, in immune homeostasis. In addition, the early acquaintance with each receptor determines the subsequent differentiation of dendritic cells, as well as the fate of the microorganisms. For example, in the case of dendritic cells, the dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin, DC\u2010SIGN, can be used as a receptor by many viruses, such as HIV\u20101 38, measles virus 43, hepatitis C virus 138, influenza A viruses 114, cytomegaloviruses 78, herpes simplex virus type 1 42, Ebola virus 3, West Nile virus 41, SARS coronavirus 177 and human T\u2010cell lymphotropic virus type 1 90. Such early\u2010recognition and subsequent intracellular pathways have been heavily investigated, revealing key pathogenic aspects in several viral diseases. The dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin, DC\u2010SIGN, interacts directly with HIV through its gp120 envelope glycoprotein, and this interaction has been established as the route of HIV transmission into T\u2010cells 63. In general, C\u2010type lectin receptors have shown repetitive patterns of use in virus uptake, survival and even systemic dissemination 10. For instance, CD46 and CD150 have been identified as the classic measles virus receptors of epithelial and immune cells 52, 160; however, the identification of measles virus infection of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, which do not express CD150, suggest the involvement of other receptors 62, 105, 109. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that interaction of the measles virus with the dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin, DC\u2010SIGN, allows CD150\u2010mediated entry into dendritic cells 9. Hence, DC\u2010SIGN seems to provide a means for transport of measles virus across the epithelial barrier, suggesting that dendritic cell infection facilitates measles virus to reach the lymphatic organs and replicate robustly 10. Similarly, DC\u2010SIGN efficiently captures the glycan structures on viral envelope glycoproteins, including those of herpes simplex virus\u20101. Herpes simplex virus\u20101 infection can decrease the immunostimulatory phenotype of dendritic cells, and DC\u2010SIGN is specifically involved in the binding and uptake of herpes simplex virus into dendritic cells 120, 134. Another example of herpesvirus infections and dendritic cell interactions is illustrated with herpes simplex virus\u20102, in which the persistent localized inflammatory response in the dermis below herpetic lesions contains chemokine (C\u2010C motif) receptor 5\u2010positive or chemokine (C\u2010C motif) receptor 4\u2010positive CD4 cells with mixed dendritic cell populations that express DC\u2010SIGN 184. The latter suggests that the wide expanse of inamed surface allows more access to target cells, especially with the anatomic proximity of DC\u2010SIGN\u2010rich dendritic cells 184.",

This expansion of the myeloid dendritic cell pool was further increased upon scaling and root planing as a result of the induced bacteremia. Moreover, in patients with chronic periodontitis and existing acute coronary syndrome, the dendritic cell pool was further expanded relative to that of patients with chronic periodontitis alone and healthy controls. We have previously reviewed other diseases reported to influence the blood myeloid dendritic cell pool 123. The response of myeloid dendritic cells in chronic periodontitis was not caused by an overall increase in total peripheral blood mononuclear cells or an increase in canonical factors, the DC\u2010poietins (e.g. CD135 ligand, granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor, interleukin\u20104\u2010 and tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands I/II) that would otherwise account for the increased numbers of myeloid dendritic cells in the circulation. It appears that the expansion occurs as a result of the microbial carriage state of the dendritic cells and their progenitors, because of the bacteremia. The circulating myeloid dendritic cells were demonstrated to carry P. gingivalis, along with a diverse microbiome. Moreover, DC\u2010SIGN+ myeloid dendritic cells, shown to contain P. gingivalis, were identified within the coronary artery plaques in situ. As P. gingivalis targets CD209 for entry into myeloid dendritic cells via its glycoprotein fimbriae, minor fimbrial adhesin 179, this phenomenon was proposed to have particular significance to the pathophysiology of both chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. Chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease have been linked through epidemiologic studies, but the mechanisms involved in the association are still unclear 50. The results of our studies indicate that the microbial carriage state of myeloid dendritic cells activates dendritic cell differentiation and promotes trafficking of these infected myeloid dendritic cells to sites of neovascularization, such as diseased coronary arteries, thereby increasing the cardiovascular risk associated with chronic periodontitis 121.",

The process of phagocytosis itself provides important information about the nature of the engulfed targets so that the pathogen can be routed to appropriate intracellular compartments for tailoring of the immune/inflammatory response 167. After phagocytosis, there are at least four pathways for lysosomal degradation in mammalian cells 125: (i) the endocytic/phagocytic pathway 166; (ii) macroautophagy, involving isolation in an enclosed membrane in the cytoplasm (i.e. the autophagosome), followed by fusion of the autophagosome with lysosomes for degradation 19, 55, 151; (iii) microautophagy, in which a small portion of cytoplasm is engulfed by a lysosome membrane itself 125; and (iv) chaperone\u2010mediated autophagy 49.

The autophagic pathway proceeds through several phases: the initiation and formation of a pre\u2010autophagosomal structure; the development of a phagophore (isolated membrane), followed by vesicle elongation and maturation (lysosomal fusion); and degradation of autophagosomal contents by lysosomal acid hydrolases 28. Autophagy is regulated by homologs of products of the autophagy\u2010related genes, originally identified in yeast 126, 141. Starvation is a potent environmental inducer of autophagy through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway 103. Conversely, growth factors, along with other nutrients, signal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which subsequently results in autophagy inhibition. Another important pathway for autophagy is the Beclin 1\u2010interacting complex, which consists of: (i) Beclin\u20101 and B\u2010cell lymphoma 2 family proteins (that inhibit autophagy); and (ii) class III phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase and the autophagy\u2010related gene, ATG14L, which is required for autophagy 82. Autophagosomal elongation requires two ubiquitin\u2010like conjugation systems: the autophagy\u2010related protein 12 and the microtubule\u2010associated protein light chain 3\u2013protein 8 conjugation systems. After elongation, the cytoplasmic microtubule\u2010associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 is the active form that associates with autophagosome formation until cargo degradation 127. The presence of light chain 3\u2010II discrete puncta on immunofluorescence analysis indicates autophagosome formation.

Recently, autophagy has been shown to function in defense against microbes. For example, Shigella, an invasive bacterium, is reported to evade autophagy in hamster kidney cells by secreting the Shigella flexneri virulent factor, IscB 135. This study also reported that mutant bacteria, which lack the S. flexneri virulent factor gene, showed lower intracellular growth rates, which returned to normal in fibroblast cells with defective autophagy (autophagy protein 5 double\u2010knockout) 135.

Another study, using human and murine macrophages, identified toll\u2010like receptor\u20104 as a sensor for autophagy 176. These studies also showed that the signaling was dependent on toll/interleukin\u20101 receptor\u2010domain\u2010containing adapter\u2010inducing interferon\u2010\u03b2 and toll\u2010like receptor\u20104 and did not affect cell viability, indicating that it is distinct from the autophagy cell\u2010death pathway. In addition, toll\u2010like receptor\u2010dependent autophagy overcomes phagosomal arrest and induces co\u2010localization of Mycobacterium with autophagosomal structures 176. In addition to optimal fusion of phagosomes or autophagosomes with lysosomes, the autophagic machinery in these cells is involved in antigen presentation through the major histocompatibility complex. Autophagy proteins in dendritic cells are critical for the fusion of lysosomes with toll\u2010like receptor apoptotic cell antigens during major histocompatibility complex class II presentation 104.",

Dendritic cells are also inclined to preserve epitopes required for antigen presentation to initiate the adaptive immune response 150.

Autophagy is recognized as an antibacterial lysosomal mechanism for dendritic cells, but also has an immunoregulatory component 13, 47, 93.

Toll\u2010like receptor engagement is the characteristic difference between immune responses in apoptotic and phagocytic cellular machineries in phagocytes 17, 166. For example, the activation of toll\u2010like receptors by bacteria has been reported to regulate phagosomal maturation and lysosomal activities in murine macrophages 17 and efficient antimicrobial autophagy 88, 104, 176. Experiments in toll\u2010like receptor\u20102\u2212/\u2212 or toll\u2010like receptor\u20104\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice have demonstrated lack of co\u2010localization of engulfed bacteria with lysosomal markers within the cytoplasm 17. These studies showed that the receptor recognition by the phagocytic cells of bacterial components is a decisive factor for the intracellular bacterial routing and intracellular degradative systems.

For uptake, CD209 contains internalizing motifs in its cytoplasmic tail 183. Interestingly, CD209 has been implicated in immune suppression and regulation in certain contexts 59, 60, 183. Most notably, CD209 is targeted for immune escape by several pathogens, such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus\u20108, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae\n78, 101, 139, 183. Recently, we reported that engagement of the dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin, DC\u2010SIGN, by the minor fimbriae (mfa\u20101) of P. gingivalis yields weak dendritic cell maturation and an immunosuppressive cytokine profile. In the absence of DC\u2010SIGN targeting by mfa1, the same pathogen yields a very different dendritic cell response, with high levels of interleukin\u201023 and interleukin\u20106, as well as induction of a T\u2010helper cell\u20101/T\u2010helper cell\u201017\u2010type response 179, 180. Furthermore, our study showed that the anaerobe P. gingivalis survives within dendritic cells in an aerobic atmosphere, whereas it dies rapidly in the absence of dendritic cells 179. More recent investigations from our laboratory (Ref 57) revealed higher survival rates of P. gingivalis after DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated uptake. This survival was associated with inhibition of expression of light chain 3\u2010II, Rab family protein\u20105 and lysosomal\u2010associated membrane protein 1 within human dendritic cells. Interestingly, the survival of this strain was inhibited within dendritic cells by autophagy induction. Alternatively, mfa1\u2212\nP. gingivalis targets a non\u2010CD209 route, mostly through toll\u2010like receptor\u20102, induced high expression of LC3\u2010II and co\u2010localization with Rab5/lysosomal\u2010associated membrane protein\u20101\u2010rich vesicles. Furthermore, P. gingivalis was enclosed in the characteristic double\u2010membrane phagophores, whilst escaping vesicle fusion after uptake via DC\u2010SIGN 57 (Fig. 1). The engagement of CD209 and toll\u2010like receptors activates distinct signaling pathways 45, 70, which results in differential intracellular routing and processing of the microbe within dendritic cells. Toll\u2010like receptors promote phagosomal and autophagosomal maturation 176 and subsequent bacterial clearance 17, 166, whereas DC\u2010SIGN seems to serve a counter\u2010regulatory function. The latter observation can also be exemplified in interactions of HIV with dendritic cells, in which not only does HIV take advantage of DC\u2010SIGN receptor permissibility to facilitate engulfment, but recent evidence suggests that the interaction can shut down autophagy mechanisms on dendritic cells 16. Although HIV generally ends up in lysosomes after autophagocytosis, the process activates the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which results in increased HIV\u20101 levels in dendritic cells and increased transmission to T\u2010cells. In fact, the pharmacological induction of autophagy by rapamycin increases HIV degradation and presentation to T\u2010cells 16. Collectively, experimental evidence supports the concept that, because the immunoregulatory machinery enclosed in dendritic cells could be exploited by certain pathogens, augmenting the innate immunity elements (e.g. toll\u2010like receptors/autophagy crosstalk) could be a useful tool in tipping back the immune response toward efficient microbial clearance.",

The maturation of the phagosome will not necessarily proceed through similar steps in different phagocytic cells. Moreover, different phagosomal maturation pathways have been reported in the same cell type. These different pathways are dictated primarily by the cargo contained in the phagosomes, as well as by external signals and the activation and/or differentiation state of phagocytes 69. In other words, \u2018all phagosomes are not created equal and there is a significant degree of phagosome heterogeneity and individuality\u2019 18. In this regard, dendritic cells seem very well equipped for such heterogeneity in phagosome pathways. The functional organization of the dendritic cell phagocytic pathway is unique in several aspects, such as: (i) the ability of dendritic cells to export proteins from the phagosome to the cytosol 145; (ii) the characteristic cross\u2010presentation and subsequent cross\u2010priming by dendritic cells to defeat viral immune\u2010evasion strategies and promote self\u2010antigen tolerance 15, 83; and (iii) evidence of a phagosomal active system of alkalinization in dendritic cells that suppresses acidification within the phagosomes, especially in the first few hours after pathogen engulfment 149, 150.

Basically, the acidic pH enhances the accessibility of proteases to target proteins by denaturation. However, each class of enzyme requires a specific range of pH for optimal activity 150. The optimal pH of proteolytic enzymes provides a system with a crucial adaptability function that suits the role of each phagocyte. For instance, studying acidification in immature dendritic cells showed no change in pH at 3 h after engulfment, in contrast to the immediate decrease of pH in macrophages. This was not only caused by the presence of a low vacuolar\u2010type H+\u2010ATPase pump but also because of active alkalinization of the phagosomes in dendritic cells 149. The active alkalinization process in dendritic cells was assumed to resemble the NADPH oxidase process in neutrophils. However, the NAPDPH oxidase activity in dendritic cells is negligible compared with that in neutrophils 58. It has been proposed that this weak generation of reactive oxygen species in dendritic cells is caused by endogenous inhibitors, which could be abolished by proinflammatory signals. Reactive oxygen species production was also improved in dendritic cells by toll\u2010like receptor ligation and T\u2010cell interactions 117, 169. Although dendritic cells and neutrophils (but not macrophages) show active alkalinization processes, the kinetics and intensities are different. Whereas neutrophil phagosomes \u2018actively\u2019 raise the pH to 8 for 15 min, dendritic cell phagosomes maintain a high pH for several hours. As suggested by others, this extended alkalinization process could be caused by a microbicidal oxidase system contained in the vesicles or by \u2018inhibitory lysosome\u2010related organelles\u2019 within dendritic cells that consume O2 and H+ to produce reactive oxygen species within the phagosomal lumen 149.

Interestingly, we recently reported that dendritic cells infected through the dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin, DC\u2010SIGN, maintain the immature form and display a reduced apoptotic rate 121. In addition, bacteria targeting DC\u2010SIGN were able to survive at a higher rate for a longer time within these immature dendritic cells 57. Typically, immature dendritic cells have a short life as a result of the initiation of active apoptosis shortly after maturation, presumably to avoid immune overstimulation 26, 32. CD209 engagement seems to alter this homeostatic balance. It also appears to have a negative influence on the ability of dendritic cells to expel intracellular cargo by pyroptosis 121. The antibacterial autophagy pathway aims to route the cargo for fusion with lysosomes to facilitate final degradation. Hence, several intracellular pathogens are suggested to block autophagosomal maturation by hindering lysosome fusion or inhibiting autophagy protein\u2010dependent fusion with the lysosome. Interestingly, some reports suggest that certain pathogens use autophagosomes for replication by blocking autophagosomal maturation 5, 13, 53.

This continuous immune activation is influenced by a unique microbial complex (i.e. biofilm) at the oral mucosal interface; however, certain microbes (e.g. P. gingivalis) are able to infect and penetrate the epithelial barrier. In addition, this persistent immune activation induces endotoxin tolerance, which can prevent excessive immune responses but can also prevent microbial clearance 128, 129, 130. Porphyromonas gingivalis has been called a \u2018keystone\u2019 species in the oral microbial community as a result of its ability to influence the entire biofilm and contribute to innate immune\u2010mediated pathogenesis 39.

Certain intracellular pathogens can evade antibacterial autophagy by several mechanisms that range from evading early recognition to inhibition of protease activity within lysosomes. For instance, Listeria monocytogenes masks itself from recognition of autophagic machinery by the formation of a propulsive actin tail 54. An L. monocytogenes surface protein, ActA, recruits the host actin polymerization apparatus (Arp2/3 and Ena/VASP) to polymerize and elongate the actin tail on the bacterial surface. In addition, L. monocytogenes seems to harbor another \u2018anti\u2019\u2010autophagic protein (In1K). Although the mechanism of In1k is as yet unclear, the absence of both In1k and Acta1 causes more bacteria to be targeted by autophagy than the absence of Acta1 alone 54.",

For example, Yersinia spp. recruit YopJ protein, which inactivates several levels of the mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, YopJ induces apoptosis and secretion of caspase\u20101 by inhibiting inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa\u2010B kinase subunit beta (nuclear factor\u2010kappaB subunit) 118, 124. Shigella spp. are reported to regulate nuclear factor\u2010kappaB through secretion of IpaH (E3 ligases), type III secreted effector proteins 7. Escherichia coli and Burkholderia pseudomallei use similar approaches by secretion of Cell cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) and Cif homologue in Burkholderia pseudomallei (CHBP) (type\u2010III secreted effectors), which deactivate nuclear factor\u2010kappaB by blocking the degradation of nuclear factor\u2010jB inhibitor 34. Alternatively, Shigella spp. decrease the acute inflammatory responses by type\u2010III secreted protein (OspF), which specifically inhibits mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases. It seems that microbes can suppress certain pathways, and activate others, to their advantage. Certain species attempt to hinder acute responses whilst augmenting chronic immune activation. This concept could be exploited through pharmacological induction of autophagy and its potential scheme in the treatment of chronic infectious diseases 28. One of the important candidates for such a strategy is sirolimus (a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor). Rapamycin functions through inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in mammalian cells and has been widely used to augment the antimicrobial properties of immune cells, whilst serving an immunosuppressive role 28, 51. Recently, we showed that rapamycin impairs the intracellular survival of P. gingivalis strains that utilize the CD209\u2010dependent route to evade autophagy 57. This could be particularly relevant in the treatment of chronic periodontitis and other chronic persistent microbial infections 121, 123, 179, 180.",

Autophagy showed regulatory actions in the innate and adaptive immune elements (as described above). Of particular interest, induction of autophagy seems to augment antimicrobial innate immunity whilst preventing excessive inflammatory responses. Hence, autophagy induction has great potential, especially in targeting chronic infectious diseases such as periodontitis. For instance, autophagy can enhance production of type I interferon and innate immune responses by delivering viral nucleic acids to endosomal toll\u2010like receptors. However, autophagy was also reported to control cellular levels of reactive oxygen species production, which prevent the response from being excessive 146. Regarding adaptive immunity, it was reported that autophagy protein\u20105 is required for dendritic cells to process and present extracellular microbial antigens for major histocompatibility complex class II presentation 104. In addition, autophagy also enhances the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, as well as cross\u2010presentation for tumor cell antigens in dendritic cells 61, 104, 111. The link between autophagy and antigen\u2010presenting cells suggests that pharmacological induction of autophagy may be beneficial, not only in the treatment of acute infection but also in enhancing vaccine efficacy.

Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a clinically approved immunosuppressive and anti\u2010cancer drug; hence, it exerts pleiotropic effects in which it induces autophagy and down\u2010regulates excessive inflammatory mediators 28. However, it is important to note that the mammalian target of rapamycin regulates several biological pathways and more specific targeted therapy may be required. Another similar approach was studied by targeting 5\u2032 adenosine monophosphate\u2010activated protein kinase activity, which induces autophagy by mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition and activation of the serine/threonine\u2010protein kinase ULK1 (an autophagy transcriptional factor) 1. Autophagy can also be induced by inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, using agents such as lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid 148. It has been suggested that these drugs induce autophagy through reduction in mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ released by the inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate\u20103\u2010kinase receptor, which causes a mild defect in mitochondrial respiration and 5\u2032 adenosine monophosphate\u2010activated protein kinase activation 22.

These observations shaped the need for agents that do not regulate the autophagic process as whole, but specifically target certain levels of autophagosomal formation and maturation (lysosomal fusion). In addition, a promising therapeutic strategy tackles the microbial properties that antagonize antibacterial autophagy. For instance, S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes (discussed earlier) are able to secrete proteins that enable them to escape recognition by the autophagic machinery 54, 135. Presumably, inhibition of these virulence factors would provide a safer and more therapeutic specific approach. This will entail specific approaches to address each type of infection individually and even the targeted host cells. One recent approach that investigated the interaction between the autophagy gene, Bec\u20101, and phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase revealed a candidate peptide (Tat\u2010becline 1) for inducing antibacterial autophagy. Tat\u2010becline 1 specifically induced autophagy and subsequently decreased the replication of several pathogens, including HIV, and reduced the mortality rates of mice infected with lethal West Nile viruses 154.

Upon dendritic cell recognition, immature myeloid dendritic cells take up P. gingivalis for intracellular trafficking and antigen processing and presentation; however, P. gingivalis contains two different adhesins [minor (mfa\u20101) and major (fimA) fimbriae], the expression of which can vary in response to environmental cues (pH and temperature). Immature myeloid dendritic cells express specific pattern recognition receptors to recognize these fimbriae. In our model, recognition is mediated by either dendritic cell\u2010specific C\u2010type lectin receptor DC\u2010SIGN\u2010dependent (A) or non\u2010DC\u2010SIGN dependent (B) routes. (A) DC\u2010SIGN recognizes minor fimbriae promoting optimal pathogen intake 180. Experimental evidence shows that the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010dependent pathway is consistently used by several pathogens to escape intracellular killing 78, 102, 140, 184. Porphyromonas gingivalis exploits the DC\u2010SIGN \u2018regulated\u2019 lysosomal pathway within dendritic cells. Hence, DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated uptake facilitates autophagy escape via inhibition of early endosomal GTPase (e.g. Rab5) and autophagy marker LC3 with subsequent lysosomal evasion. Autophagy evasion is most clearly evidenced by localization of P. gingivalis (expressing minor fimbriae) to single membrane intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1). The DC\u2010SIGN\u2010dependent pathway prolongs the life of the immature myeloid dendritic cell and promotes the intracellular survival of P. gingivalis, thus potentially facilitating persistent infection and systemic dissemination. This immature myeloid dendritic cell secretes proinflammatory cytokines and, upon interaction with naive T\u2010cells, leads to a T\u2010cell regulatory response typically found in chronic inflammatory conditions. (B) Porphyromonas gingivalis\u2010expressing major fimbriae could potentially be recognized by nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerization domain/toll\u2010like receptor pathways (currently unknown). Evidence shows that the non\u2010DC\u2010SIGN pathway mediated by the nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerization domain or toll\u2010like receptor promotes efficient autophagy processes 31, 88, 105, 177. The uptake of P. gingivalis expressing major fimbriae is directed toward Rab5/LC3+ phagophores fused with lysosome for efficient degradation. This leads to induction of dendritic cell maturation and efficient P. gingivalis clearance. The intracellular trafficking pathway ultimately determines the T\u2010cell effectors that are induced \u2013 induced regulatory T\u2010cells or a T\u2010helper 1/T\u2010helper 17 response \u2013 resulting in either a state of acquired immune privilege or resolution of infection.
