            "text": "Research from the past several decades has implicated the posttranslational modifier ubiquitin (Ub) in the regulation of nearly all aspects of cellular signaling, including fundamental roles in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, cell cycle progression, and immune responses. The breadth of cellular roles played by Ub stems in part from its ability to be further posttranslationally modified. Modification of Ub can take the form of additional ubiquitination at one or several of its eight possible amide linkage points, creating complex polyUb chains; by modification with a Ub-like modifier (UBL) such as NEDD8 or SUMO; or through the addition of small chemical groups such as phosphorylation or acetylation (Swatek & Komander, 2016). The combinatorial possibilities of these alterations are enormous and give rise to what is sometimes called the \u201cUb code\u201d (Komander & Rape, 2012). While the significance for many aspects of the Ub code remain to be deciphered, it is clear from the immense body of work at hand that breakdown or dysregulation of Ub signaling can result in severe health-related consequences (Rape, 2018). Therefore, all aspects of the Ub system are under tight control by hundreds of enzymes that together constitute the \u201cwriters,\u201d \u201creaders,\u201d and \u201cerasers\u201d of the Ub code.",

            "text": "Writer enzymes, consisting of the E1 Ub-activating, E2 Ub-conjugating, and E3 Ub-ligating enzymes, regulate the synthesis of defined Ub signals on specific targets. Reader proteins recognize these signals and help elicit the desired cellular outcomes. Eraser enzymes, also known as deubiquitinases (DUBs), are key regulators of the Ub system. Humans encode approximately 100 DUB genes belonging to seven protease families (Haahr et al., 2018; Hermanns et al., 2018; Hewings et al., 2018; Kwasna et al., 2018; Mevissen & Komander, 2017). Additional proteases are specific toward UBL modifiers; herein we collectively refer to all Ub/UBL proteases as DUBs for simplicity. These specialized proteases hydrolyze the isopeptide or peptide linkage at the carboxy-terminus of the Ub/UBL modifier that links it to substrate primary amine groups, usually lysine side chains, thus reversing the action of the writer enzyme and recycling the Ub/UBL back into the free pool for future rounds of conjugation. DUBs can be exquisitely specific for discrete cellular targets, either by selecting particular forms of the modification (e.g., OTULIN (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Rivkin et al., 2013)), by recognizing the modified substrate (e.g., the SAGA complex (Morgan et al., 2016)), or via regulation of subcellular localization (e.g., USP30 (Bingol et al., 2014)) (reviewed in Mevissen & Komander, 2017). Owing to their roles as key regulators of the Ub signal, DUBs have recently become a popular target for pharmacological intervention (Gavory et al., 2018; Kategaya et al., 2017; Lamberto et al., 2017; Pozhidaeva et al., 2017; Turnbull et al., 2017) and show potential for \u201cdrugging the undruggable\u201d (Huang & Dixit, 2016).",

As a key part of this process, one must be able to reconstitute DUB activity in vitro with substrates that have a high likelihood of physiological relevance. Biomedical product catalogues are filled with an array of Ub substrates; choosing those that suit one's needs best and recognizing the intrinsic limitations of such substrates is critical. In the first part of this chapter, we describe several of these substrates and demonstrate their utility in characterizing novel DUB activities. Second, visualization of DUB activity through structural characterization is a prerequisite for understanding the molecular nuts and bolts of the enzyme and its function, as well as identifying any unique properties that distinguish it from related family members. A number of biochemical tools and techniques have emerged in recent years to facilitate such an endeavor, and these will be discussed in the second part of this chapter.",

An important control to run in parallel is the inactive Cys-to-Ala DUB variant, which should abolish probe reactivity (Fig. 1A).

In another unique case, the foot and mouth disease viral protease Lbpro hydrolyzes the UBL modifier ISG15 two residues short of the carboxy-terminus; conventional ISG15 ABPs place the electrophilic warhead out of register and will not react (Swatek et al., 2018). Although these are special cases of unique DUB mechanisms, they demonstrate the potential for false negative results in this assay. We have also noted false positive reactivity of the NEDD8 ABP with entirely Ub-specific DUB enzymes (Mevissen et al., 2013), due to its sequence similarity to Ub. Therefore, Ub/UBL ABPs provide an excellent first measure of activity but should always be verified through other assays, such as those highlighted in Fig. 1.",

First, if parameters such as enzyme concentration, reaction temperature, and time are adjusted such that the fastest reaction is at or near completion at the end of the time course, substrate specificity over the other chain types can be estimated qualitatively. DUBs can display no, some, or in several cases absolute specificity for a single chain linkage type, and determining this requires repeated and careful analyses at multiple enzyme concentrations (Mevissen et al., 2013). ChlaDUB1 demonstrates a preference for K63-linked chains and (to a lesser extent) K48-linked chains (Fig. 1C), but at higher concentration or longer incubations will cleave other chain types as well. An additional advantage over other substrates is that the behavior of polyUb cleavage can be telling of added layers of specificity. Stochastic cleavage of all Ub chain lengths, as observed for ChlaDUB1 (Fig. 1C), indicates recognition of diUb as a minimal unit, whereas rapid cleavage of longer chains down to diUb would indicate additional Ub binding sites that favor increased chain length (see below).",

Examples of DUBs containing these sites are fewer, but they determine the context of the minimal diUb unit recognized across the active site. For example, S2/S2\u2032 sites can introduce a preference toward longer polyUb chain length or toward a heterotypic or branched chain architecture (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al., 2015; Mevissen et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2011). The existence of an S2/S2\u2032 site that introduces a preference for chain length can be determined by closely monitoring the cleavage of tetraUb chains (as discussed above); enzymes that possess these sites will rapidly cleave the longer chain down to the less preferred tri or diUb length, while enzymes that lack S2/S2\u2032 sites will cleave tetraUb more stochastically. DiUb fluorescent substrates and ABPs have also been developed to characterize the existence and specificity of S2 sites (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al., 2016; Flierman et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2011).",

This strategy has proven successful on numerous occasions, most of which take advantage of a monoUb/UBL ABP to study substrate binding to the S1 site. However, particularly for those DUBs that specifically target polyUb chains, a monoUb-bound complex does not tell the full story of substrate encounter. For these cases, nonhydrolyzable diUb-based ABPs were developed that place the electrophilic warhead between the two Ub moieties (Haj-Yahya et al., 2014; Iph\u00f6fer et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014; McGouran et al., 2013; Mulder et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2017). These ABPs trap the substrate\u2013enzyme complex, and have proven effective for structure determination of the K11-specific DUB Cezanne (Mevissen et al., 2016) and the Met1-specific DUB OTULIN (Weber et al., 2017). A second diUb-based ABP, in which the warhead is placed at the carboxy-terminus of the proximal Ub, can trap a substrate bound into the S1 and S2 sites (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2011). In all cases, buffer conditions, reaction parameters, and enzyme:ABP stoichiometry are optimized to push the reaction as close to completion as possible. Final purification of the trapped complex can be achieved through ion exchange and/or size exclusion chromatography, or through the use of an ABP bearing an affinity tag.",

Instead, we will discuss the techniques and examples that have proven successful in the past in order to provide a framework for what can be done with the tools available in the field. Well-defined substrate-bound DUB complexes can be studied with solution and crystallographic structural methods. Depending on size and behavior, NMR can be a useful tool for understanding DUB dynamics and regulation in solution, as shown for the DUBs AMSH and Cezanne (Hologne et al., 2016; Mevissen et al., 2016) as well as the UBL protease SENP1 (Ambaye, Chen, Khanna, Li, & Chen, 2018). Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry can also be used to monitor conformational changes associated with substrate recognition (Gersch et al., 2017; Mevissen et al., 2016). Finally, single-molecule techniques can inform on more global structural parameters, such as polyUb chain conformation following DUB binding (Ye et al., 2012). Crystallography and potentially cryo-electron microscopy can provide the highest-resolution information on substrate recognition and combined with covalent ABPs can offer the fastest route to understanding DUB specificity and mechanism.",

We have used monoUb/UBL ABPs extensively to characterize the role of the S1 site in substrate recognition. Cross-specific DUBs that possess Ub and UBL protease activities are particularly interesting cases, and ABPs have allowed us to explain the Ub/ISG15 cross-reactivity of the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus vOTU (Akutsu et al., 2011, James et al., 2011), as well as the Ub/tomato SUMO (tSUMO) cross-reactivity of Xanthomonas campestris XopD (Pruneda et al., 2016). In the case of XopD, we found that the S1 site is malleable, allowing it to recognize the structurally similar but sequence-divergent Ub and tSUMO substrates (Fig. 3A). The propargyl amide warhead was used for both substrates in this case, and provided a nice mimetic in the XopD active site (Fig. 3B). S1\u2013S1\u2032 diUb ABPs have also successfully trapped and allowed the crystallization of the Cezanne-K11 diUb complex (Mevissen et al., 2016) and the OTULIN-Met1 diUb complex (Weber et al., 2017). In the case of OTULIN, the noncovalent complex with the inactive Cys-to-Ala variant DUB had been crystallized previously (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Rivkin et al., 2013), and the diUb ABP could be confirmed as a suitable mimetic (Weber et al., 2017). The S1\u2013S2 diUb ABP has also proven effective in the crystallization of the SARS coronavirus papain-like protease, explaining its di-distributive behavior of cleaving K48-linked polyUb (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al., 2016).",

DUBs encoding this level of substrate- and site-specificity are likely few in number (as the number of ubiquitination sites outweighs the number of regulatory DUBs by ~ 500 fold) but critical for regulating fundamental cellular processes. Proteases responsible for regulating the UBL modifier SUMO must not only recognize polySUMO chains but also process the precursor SUMO translation product and remove SUMO from target proteins. The latter two processes have been captured in noncovalent complexes and crystallized to reveal the details of how both peptide- and isopeptide-linked SUMO are coordinated into the active site for hydrolysis (Reverter & Lima, 2006). The major role of the UBL modifier NEDD8 is in the regulation of cullin-RING Ub ligases, and this modification is in turn regulated by a dedicated ~ 350 kDa complex termed the COP9 signalosome (Lingaraju et al., 2014). While higher-resolution studies are eagerly awaited, low-resolution electron microscopy studies show large conformational changes associated with NEDDylated cullin binding to the COP9 signalosome, placing the NEDD8 carboxy-terminus near the catalytic subunit, CSN5 (Lingaraju et al., 2014). Lastly, a recent crystal structure has captured how a module from the SAGA transcriptional coactivator complex deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated histone H2B (Morgan et al., 2016). Each of these studies needed to overcome major obstacles in both enzyme and substrate preparation with the reported structures revealing remarkable insights into DUB mechanism and biology.",

However, pharmacological efforts targeting DUB activity demand high-throughput, and the ideal solution to this requirement remains to be seen. Advances in fluorescent substrates are producing more and more suitable mimetics to the natural substrate (Geurink et al., 2012).

As our appreciation of the in vivo Ub code expands, so must our toolset for biochemical and structural studies in vitro. We now know that Ub can be coated by additional posttranslational modifications such as UBLs, phosphorylation, or acetylation (Swatek & Komander, 2016) and that Ub modification of other proteins is not limited to their Lys residues but can also be attached through the amino-terminus or Cys and Ser residue side chains (McDowell & Philpott, 2013). DUB substrates with Ub linked to the target protein in these ways are becoming available (Huguenin-Dezot et al., 2016; Sun, Meledin, Mali, & Brik, 2018) or are on the horizon, and these will undoubtedly reveal fascinating new details of DUB specificity and function.",

(A) Ub/UBL ABP assay monitoring reactivity of Cys-based DUBs. ABPs with a propargyl amide \u201cwarhead\u201d can be purchased commercially or prepared using intein technology (Borodovsky et al., 2002); reactivity is monitored by a molecular weight shift in SDS-PAGE following Coomassie staining. ChlaDUB1 reacts irreversibly with ABPs based on Ub and NEDD8, but not SUMO or ISG15. (B) Ub/UBL-KG(TAMRA) fluorescence-based activity assay. Fluorescent substrates can be purchased commercially or prepared using native chemical ligation (Geurink et al., 2012), and monitored by change in fluorescence polarization. As indicated by the ABP assay, ChlaDUB1 cleaves Ub and NEDD8 substrates, but not SUMO or ISG15. (C) PolyUb chain specificity assay. Purified tetraUb chains for all linkages except K27 can be purchased commercially or prepared enzymatically by the investigator (Michel, Komander, & Elliott, 2018), and cleavage monitored by a molecular weight shift in SDS-PAGE following silver staining. Among the seven polyUb chain types tested, ChlaDUB1 prefers to cleave K63- and (to a lesser extent) K48-linked chains.",
