Bacteriophage predation can regulate microbial abundance and diversity in full\u2010scale biogas units (Shapiro et al., 2010), according to the proposed \u2018phage kills the winner\u2019 strategy (Thingstad and Lingen, 1997). Even though the predator\u2013prey paradigm is still underdeveloped in microbial ecology, research dedicated to aquatic habitats estimated that viral activity (e.g. specific lytic infection and/or prophage induction and activation of the viral DNA replication) destroys daily around 20% of microbial cells worldwide, thus having important implications to microbial food chains, carbon turnover and the global carbon cycle (Suttle, 2007; Maurice et al., 2013).",

Nevertheless, the AD viral population (virome) has received very little attention compared with the AD microbial population (microbiome). Even though bacteriophage lysis was shown to regulate microbial abundance and diversity in full\u2010scale AD reactors treating industrial waste water (Shapiro et al., 2010), and phages were shown to propagate in methanogenic reactors at a rate in terms of virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) of at least 5.2 \u00d7 107 VLPs day\u22121 l\u22121 (Park et al., 2007), to date there are only a few studies characterizing the viral genomic content (mainly dsDNA phages) in these environments (Wu and Liu, 2009; Tamaki et al., 2012; Bibby and Peccia, 2013a).

We believe that using an optimized VLP filtration protocol that excluded the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) commonly used in viral metagenomics (MDA is known to enhance chimera formation and to create random over\u2010amplification; Marine et al., 2014), together with a combination of both sequence\u2010independent and sequence\u2010dependent data analyses, allowed us to establish a detailed and fair picture of viral assemblages in AD reactors.",

To evaluate the impact of the pre\u2010filtration and the tangential flow filtration (TFF) protocols on the efficiency of VLPs recovery, a representative sludge sample was autoclaved (to keep the sample texture close to the original but to eliminate viruses) and spiked in with a \u03a6X174 phage suspension. The phage \u03a6X174, spiked at a known amount, was used to evaluate the recovery rate of VLPs at the different steps of the virus filtration protocol (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13127/suppinfo). According to the number of plaque\u2010forming units (pfu ml\u22121) calculated for each fraction, the amount of the phage remained in the same order of magnitude after the pre\u2010filtration steps. However, it decreased by onefold following the TFF, mounted with a Sartocon Slice 200 Hydrosart cassette of 0.22 \u03bcm, and ultracentrifugation steps. Longer ultracentrifugation time did not result in a higher phage recovery rate (results not shown). Although in general the VLPs filtration protocol performed well, the two last steps could introduce a quantitative bias, especially important if absolute quantification of viruses in a sample is considered (not the case in our study).",

In our case, no additional families were detected for dsDNA viromes with the cassette of 0.45 \u03bcm size in comparison to 0.22 \u03bcm, and the data for the two samples analysed with the two cassette types correlated well (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13127/suppinfo). Moreover, the estimated total species richness, based on contiguous sequences (contigs) spectra, was independent of the cassette pore size used (Table 2). For RNA viromes no striking differences at the family level were observed for either of the two cassette types used.

However, the use of the CLC Genomic Workbench instead of crAss allowed us to perform the co\u2010assembly (separately for dsDNA and RNA viromes) and to determine a normalized (per metagenome size and contig length) degree of relatedness (here referred to contigs spectra), within the same application (not the case for crAss that requires a separate assembly software to be used). In continuation, these relative contigs abundance spectra expressed as DNA\u2010reads per kilobase of transcript (gene) per million reads mapped (DNA\u2010RPKM; here equalled to the number of reads mapped to the contig and normalized by the contig length and per million mappable reads), together with a contig affiliation (sequence\u2010dependent approach), gave a view on a normalized composition profile of dsDNA and RNA viromes for each sludge sample.",

When the reads were mapped back to the assembled contigs, only 48.5% could be aligned for dsDNA viromes, and the collector's curve analysis showed that the detection of the potential viruses\u2010like sequences was not completely saturated (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13127/suppinfo). In contrast, nearly 82% of reads could map back to the assembled RNA contigs, and the calculated rarefaction curves confirmed that most of the existing viral RNA genetic diversity in AD reactors of the three main types was characterized in this study (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13127/suppinfo).",

To verify a possible microbial genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination versus potentially novel massive diversity of dsDNA viruses in AD reactors, the predicted protein features for virus\u2010assigned and unassigned dsDNA contigs were further functionally annotated (Fig. 2A and B). As a result, for contigs assigned of viral origin, 56.3% of the predicted proteins could have been functionally annotated, and their functional profile was different from the non\u2010virus assigned contigs (Pearson correlation coefficient, r of 0.375). Using the subsystems approach (Overbeek et al., 2005), 30.95% of annotated proteins fell into the category \u2018phages, prophages, transposable elements, plasmids', and 14.75% were classified into \u2018clustering\u2010based subsystems\u2019 (unknown function), followed by \u2018DNA metabolism\u2019 (10.46%). In the case of the remaining contigs (64.8 K) that could not be taxonomically assigned of viral origin, only 26.5% of their predicted proteins could have been functionally annotated (Fig. 2A). Their distribution into subsystems categories was similar to a typical microbial metagenome from an AD digester (r of 0.994; Magdalena Calusinska unpubl. data), with three dominant subcategories, including \u2018clustering\u2010based subsystems\u2019 (16.22%), \u2018protein metabolism\u2019 (11.27%) and \u2018carbohydrates\u2019 (11.25%), pointing to bacterial gDNA contamination. Interestingly, the remaining predicted unknown protein features for virus\u2010unassigned contigs that could not be annotated point towards a novel genetic diversity potentially of viral origin. Indeed, out of the estimated 3.9 M protein clusters for the global virome (Ignacio\u2010Espinoza et al., 2013), only around 5000 viral genomes were sequenced and annotated at the time the study was conducted. Moreover, as the majority of the determined open reading frames (ORFs) have no close relatives available in the public databases (Roux et al., 2014a), the analysis of AD viromes provides strong evidence of novel viral genetic diversity in this environment.",

Indeed, previous studies investigating viral assemblages in methanogenic reactors reported the size of some viral DNA genomes to be between 30 and 80 kb (Wu and Liu, 2009), which is in the range of the longest contigs identified in this study. However, further sequence\u2010independent (e.g. based on the calculated contigs spectra, thus not biased by existing databases) contig binning (identification of contigs derived from one genome) should help to re\u2010construct additional new viral genomes, as it was reported for a novel crAssphage discovered in human faecal metagenomes (Dutilh et al., 2014).

Only contigs that were annotated of putatively viral origin were used to calculate the richness. On the one hand, this conservative approach most probably resulted in diversity indices that were minimum estimates, and any novel viruses that show little or no sequence similarity to the previously sequenced ones were not considered. On the other hand, restriction of the analyses to contigs containing ORFs with significant similarity to previously sequenced viral genes should help to reduce the overestimation of richness caused by free contaminant bacterial gDNA (Roux et al., 2013). Spurious singletons (e.g. sequences that could not assemble in larger contigs) that can easily inflate species richness were further addressed by applying a discounted model (Allen et al., 2013). As a result, the estimated richness of DNA viruses was in general higher in farm digesters and biogas units treating a mixture of solid waste and agro\u2010food residues in comparison to WWTP (Table 2). Moreover, thanks to the normalization approach chosen in our study, we could quantitatively compare the richness between the dsDNA and RNA viruses. Accordingly, the estimated richness of dsDNA viruses was outnumbered by at least two orders of magnitude that of RNA viruses present in the analysed AD reactors.",

On the other hand, Caudovirales genomes account for nearly 89% of all sequenced viral genomes (NCBI Viral Genomes, August 2015), biasing current databases and what may influence their predominance in metagenomic studies. Nevertheless, according to the recent revision of the electron microscopic descriptions of prokaryotic viruses, Caudovirales represent the vast majority (over 96.3%) of all known dsDNA bacteriophages (Ackermann and Prangishvili, 2012), supporting the reasonable assumption that Caudovirales might indeed dominate the virome of anaerobic reactors.",

Nonetheless, due to the sequencing approach undertaken in our study, ssDNA viruses were not targeted; therefore, it is not known if and at what quantities they exist in AD reactors. For this reason, to draw more conclusions on how phages interact with their microbial hosts in AD environments, it is important to further analyse ssDNA viruses to have a complete view of viral assemblages.

Here, roughly 16 contigs were of putative Siphoviridae origin, and they were most closely related to Archaeal BJ1 virus\u2010like. Interestingly, 19 contigs of different size range (643\u20134461 bp) were putatively assigned to Salterprovirus, and each of the contigs encoded type\u2010B DNA polymerase, which is a signature of this viral genus. Remarkably, at least two different genotypes of Salterprovirus\u2010like viruses were present, one prevailing in WWTP AD reactors and the other in farm and municipal solid waste treating reactors. Until now, two genomes of Salterprovirus were sequenced, namely His1 and His2, and the viruses were shown to infect only the extremely halophilic genus Haloarcula (Bath et al., 2006). Multiple other dsDNA contigs were assigned to unclassified archaeal viruses that were mainly similar to Haloviruses, Pyrococcus abyssi virus 1 and Hyperthermophilic Archaeal Virus 2.

Indeed, for over 6000 bacterial viruses studied to date, less than 100 archaeal viruses have been described, and most of them infect extremophiles (Ackermann and Prangishvili, 2012). Moreover, except for the head\u2010tailed viruses affecting archaea, most of the characterized archaeal viruses share genome sequence similarity only with the taxonomically closely related viruses (Pietila et al., 2014). Therefore, the identification of novel archaeal viruses that relies on a comparative analysis with sequences deposited in public databases (66 complete genomes were deposited in NCBI Viral Genomes, August 2015) does not correctly reflect their diversity in newly studied natural environments; hence, the genetic diversity of archaeal viruses still remains poorly characterized.",

In general, RNA viruses infecting bacteria are rare, while up to now there were no archaeal RNA viruses reported (Nasir et al., 2014). In consequence, except for one contig assigned as unclassified Levivirus Acinetobacter phage AP205, the two known families of bacterial RNA viruses, namely dsRNA Cystoviridae and ssRNA Leviviridae, were not detected in AD reactors. Interestingly, 46% of virus\u2010assigned RNA contigs were potential plant pathogens and were associated with five ssRNA(+) viral families, namely Virgaviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Tombusviridae, Potyviridae and Secoviridae (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13127/suppinfo). Based on the identity scores to viral genomes listed in Refseq, 11 known viruses were identified using the criteria of \u2265 80% sequence identity over \u2265 90% of sequence length. Several contigs represented Tobamovirus genus (tobacco mosaic virus group), including many members that are widespread and well\u2010characterized plant pathogens, e.g. cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, pepper mild mottle virus, turnip vein\u2010clearing virus, etc. To our surprise, WWTP and municipal solid waste treating AD reactors were the main reservoirs of these viruses with, respectively, nine and ten Tobamovirus members present, while only six were found in farm AD reactors. The prevalence of plant pathogenic viruses in WWTP AD reactors (between 59 and 97% of RNA contigs annotated as plant pathogens were present in the sludge samples from WWTP AD reactors analysed here) could be explained by their dominance in human faeces which are input substrates. The contaminated food was proposed to be the source of plant\u2010infecting RNA viruses in human faeces (Zhang et al., 2005).",

Additionally, the full chain of reactors (fed reactors, post\u2010digesters and storage tanks) should be studied to evaluate the potential of the AD cascade to reduce plant pathogenic viruses.

However, except for three contigs that were putatively annotated as human herpes viruses, none of the other DNA contigs were directly assigned as human pathogens. Whereas our study did not reveal the presence of human adenoviruses in the AD reactors of the Schifflange WWTP [results confirmed by an additional quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13127/suppinfo], an integrated cell culture PCR approach showed their presence in the main influent and effluent streams of the aerobic treatment tanks of the same plant (Ogorzaly et al., 2013). Since adenoviruses represent risk to human health, their removal through AD treatment is an alternative that could be considered to re\u2010design modern WWTPs. Nevertheless, as human adenoviruses were detected in influent and effluent sludge from other mesophilic AD reactors located in the US (Bibby and Peccia, 2013a, 2013b), a global monitoring of different WWTPs should be performed with a standardized procedure (e.g. excluding the MDA step that biases the final quantitative results) to assess the efficiency of the removal of human viral pathogens through the AD treatment. No annotated human gastrointestinal RNA viruses, e.g. rotaviruses, astroviruses, certain members of coronaviruses, etc., were detected in the AD reactors studied. Also, previous metagenomic analysis of human faeces from healthy individuals indicated that less than 2.9% of sequencing RNA reads resembled animal viruses (Zhang et al., 2005), meaning that although the raw sewage represents the effluent from urban human activities, provided that a large part of the population is composed of healthy human individuals, human gastrointestinal viruses are uncommon in methanogenic reactors of WWTPs.",

These observations suggest that viruses in AD reactors, mainly dsDNA head\u2010tailed phages, form assemblages that are different from those found in other environments. Indeed, at the genomic level, Caudovirales are an extremely divergent group with mosaic genomes composed of conserved and variable regions. Most of their homologous nucleotide and protein sequences often display none or only 10\u201320% identity in pairwise comparisons (Krupovic et al., 2011), essentially leading to a high number of hypothetical proteins discovered in viral metagenomes (Hurwitz and Sullivan, 2013). Moreover, it has been assessed at a global scale that between 109 and 1010 fully functional bacteriophage genomes are produced via non\u2010homologous recombination every second (Hendrix, 2009), and once they are viable they can easily spread within the population of closely related viruses, thus keeping on generating diversity. As phages obligatorily require their bacterial hosts, and the concentration and diversity of bacteria are high in AD reactors, no wonder that extensive homologous or non\u2010homologous re\u2010combinations, genomic segment duplications, etc. may take place, leading to a rapid evolution and an immense and novel diversity of bacteriophages in these environments.",

Moreover, the main interest to study viruses in this environment is not only the fact that by shaping microbial dynamics they can negatively influence the process of methane production, but also the development of a phage\u2010mediated treatment of anaerobic sludge, by regulating the abundance of key functional microbial groups, has the potential to control some of the process problems, like foaming, sludge dewaterability and digestibility, or the competition between nuisance and functionally important bacteria (Withey et al., 2005). Although current sequencing methodologies, e.g. metagenomics, enable the sequencing of wild viral assemblages with unprecedented depth and resolution, due to an incredibly high diversity of viral genomes, the majority of viral sequences are not yet found in databases, which prevents their complete characterization when relying on sequence homology\u2010based identification. Therefore, further genetic analysis of gene contents of the identified phage contigs should provide more information about their lifestyle, and investigations with methods such as viral tagging (Deng et al., 2012) or digital PCR (Tadmor et al., 2011) will be required to expand our knowledge on the interactions between viruses and their hosts in AD environments.",

Assembled and annotated contigs are available via metavir2 project Accession Numbers 3506 (dsDNA virome) and 3518 (RNA virome). Contigs classified of viral origin and those that could not be classified as viruses were further functionally annotated using the MG\u2010RAST server (Meyer et al., 2008), and are accessible thought the MG\u2010RAST ID Numbers 4559444.3 and 4571041.3 respectively.",
