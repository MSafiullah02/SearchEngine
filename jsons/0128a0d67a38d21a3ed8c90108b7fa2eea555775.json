Lopinavir is an inducer of methadone metabolism, leading to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof sub-therapeutic level of methadone and the emergence of opioid withdrawal symptoms (which overlap with symptoms of COVID-19) within a week of LR initiation [6]. However, no clinically significant interaction was reported with buprenorphine, another medication treatment for opioid use disorders. Administration of LR inhibits CYP3A-mediated Ndemethylation of oxycodone, leading to significant increase in plasma concentrations of oxycodone, consequently increasing risk of overdose [7]. Concurrent use of LR and bupropion for smoking cessation, may lead to reduction in bupropion concentration, possibly due to induction of CYP2B6 and glucuronidation [8]. Liquid (not the capsule) formulation of LR contains 42.4% ethanol. Its co-administration with disulfiram (for treatment of alcohol dependence) could result in ethanol-disulfiram reaction; it should be avoided.",

Drugs of misuse, such as tramadol and tapentadol, are sold as fixeddose combinations with acetaminophen. High dose misuse of these drugs with favipiravir might increase the risk of acetaminophen toxicity [10].

Presently hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir-ritonavir combination (LR), remdesivir, and favipiravir are candidate medications.

Moreover, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic has met with a pre-existing epidemic of Opioid use disorders. Given the susceptibility and magnitude of both the conditions, co-occurrence seems to be commonplace.
