Therefore, computational methods of biological sequence analysis become an indispensable part of the modern scientist's research arsenal1. In protein studies, the results of sequence similarity searches in databases help generate reasonable hypotheses concerning structural and functional properties of proteins.2, 3 On the DNA level, sequence analysis techniques make it possible to identify genes and functional elements in newly sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic analysis4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 not only provides us evolutionary relations among the sequences but also provides useful information for pharmaceutical researchers to determine which medicinal species share the same medical qualities.

A k\u2010word is a series of k consecutive letters in a sequence. The k\u2010word statistical analysis consists of counting occurrences of k\u2010words in a given sequence. For a sequence s, the count of a k\u2010word w, denoted by c(w), is the number of occurrence of w in the sequence s. The standard approach for counting k\u2010words in a sequence of length m is to use a sliding window of length k, shifting the frame one base at a time from position 1 to m\u2212k+1. In this method, k\u2010words are allowed to overlap in the sequence.

In addition, the way Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov test work is by generating a normal probability plot,35 it is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a data set is approximately normally distributed. Figure 2 is the normal probability plot of 3\u2010word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence.

But, if we estimated this distribution,  from the data , formally, Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov test is inaccurate in this case. There is a version of Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov test, called Lilliefors test,36 that tests normality of the distribution by comparing the data with a fitted Gaussian distribution as we did above, but with a correction to give a more accurate approximation of the distribution of the test statistic. The test proceeds as follows: (1) estimate the population mean and population variance based on the data; (2) find the maximum discrepancy between the empirical distribution function and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with the estimated mean and estimated variance, just as in the Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov test, this will be the test statistic; (3) confront the question of whether the maximum discrepancy is large enough to be statistically significant, thus requiring rejection of the null hypothesis. We also take the 3\u2010word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence for example and perform Lilliefors test. First, we estimate the population mean  and population variance  based on the 3\u2010word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence. Then, we perform Lilliefors test that the 3\u2010word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence comes from the distribution N(0.0156,0.0066).

First, all SARS\u2010CoVs are grouped in a separate branch, which appear different from the other three groups of coronaviruses. Secondly, BCOV, BCOVL, BCOVM, BCOVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP are grouped into a branch, which is consonant with that they belong to group II. Thirdly, HCoV\u2010229E, TGEV, and PEDV are closely related to each other, which is consistent with the fact that they belong to group I.28 Finally, IBV forms a distinct branch within the genus Coronavirus, because it belongs to group III. Grigoriev43 found that the mutational patterns in SARS\u2010CoV genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARS\u2010CoV was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus.44 Rota et al.42 found out that the overall level of similarity between SARS\u2010CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low. Our tree also reconfirms that SARS\u2010CoVs are not closely related to any previously isolated coronaviruses and form a new group, which indicates that the SARS\u2010CoVs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses.",

Being different from the sequence alignment method, the current method is more simple and yields results reasonably.",

We assume that the frequencies of a given k\u2010word in a biological sequence follows the Gaussian distribution. The similarity between two sequences can be evaluated by the difference between their corresponding Gaussian models. In contrast to the traditional word\u2010based methods based on frequencies of fixed k\u2010words, our method takes distribution information of k\u2010word frequencies into account. In other words, our method has the ability to adjust the background information for similarity measure using k\u2010word frequencies. The test of our methods are to perform similarity search and evaluate the functionally related genes. To evaluate this method, we compare it with alignment\u2010based or word\u2010based methods. The comparison demonstrates that our method, intending to explore k\u2010word frequency distribution information, gives more competitive results (Tables 1 and 2). In addition, the reasonable results of phylogenetic tree construction illustrate the validity of our method for phylogenetic analysis.",
