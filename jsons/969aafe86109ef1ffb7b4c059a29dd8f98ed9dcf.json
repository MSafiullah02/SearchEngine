The nucleotide sequence encoding VP1, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of BD 3/99 was aligned with that of 17 other IBDV strains including six very virulent, three classical virulent, five classical attenuated, one antigenic variant and two serotype 2 strains. The VP1 genes of all very virulent strains were 97.5% to 99.8% identical. With the exception of an atypical Australian strain, 002-73, all of the classical virulent or attenuated and antigenic variant strains were also 97.5% to 100% identical. Serotype 2 strains showed only 4-6% divergence from serotype 1 classical virulent or attenuated strains; in contrast, however, the very virulent strains were 10.5% to 12.5% divergent from the classical virulent or attenuated strains as well as serotype 2 strains. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of VP1 revealed 17 common, including 8 unique amino acid substitutions in the very virulent strains. In the phylogenetic tree the very virulent strains formed a distinct cluster and all other strains including classical virulent, attenuated and antigenic variant strains and even serotype 2 strains were grouped together.

Nucleotide sequencing of the variable domain of the VP2 gene and antigenic characterization with a panel of monoclonal antibodies confirmed that BD 3/99 antigenetically and genetically related to very virulent IBDV isolated recently from Europe, Asia and Africa [17] . In the present study a full-length cDNA clone of the segment B of BD 3/99 was constructed. Briefly, cDNA corresponding to the whole genome segment was synthesized and amplified in two overlapping fragments by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To this end, RNA was isolated from the infected bursal homogenate essentially as described [17] .

Two pairs of primers (Table 1 ) based on the segment B sequence of IBDV strain Cu-1 were used in the RT-PCR. The B1-sense primer had an XbaI restriction site and a T7 promoter sequence tagged to its 5 -end, while SmaI, XbaI and XhoI restriction sites were tagged to the 5 -end of the B2-antisense primer. The overlapping region in the two cDNA fragments (B1 and B2) contained a unique BglII restriction site. The B1 fragment was first cloned in the pQE 60 vector (Qiagen, Germany) using XbaI and BglII restriction sites and then the B2 fragment was cloned in the same vector using BglII and XhoI restriction sites; thus a full-length clone of BD 3/99 segment B cDNA (pQE-BD3/B) was constructed. The cloned cDNA insert has a SmaI restriction site at the 3 -end and a T7 promoter at the 5 -end, to be used for linearising the plasmid and in vitro transcription of RNA, respectively. The insert is also flanked by two XbaI restriction sites, which can be used for its subsequent transfer to another vector, if required.",

Each of these fragments was subcloned in the pBluescript II Sk + vector (Stratagene, Germany). The subcloned cDNA fragments were sequenced from the both ends with M13 forward and reverse primers using Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit on an automated ABI 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., USA). The sequence data were compiled using the computer programme Edit-Seq (DNASTAR Inc., USA). Subclones obtained from two independently constructed full-length clones were sequenced. In case of any sequence discrepancy between the duplicate clones, the respective region was amplified by RT-PCR from the original RNA sample using appropriate primers (data not shown) and then sequenced directly. The deduced amino acid sequence of the VP1 of BD 3/99 is presented in Fig. 1 . The VP1 sequence of BD 3/99 was compared with that of other IBDV strains by the Clustal V multiple alignment method using the computer programme MegAlign (DNASTAR Inc., USA). In this method the sequences are grouped into clusters on the basis of the distance between each pairs. The clusters are first aligned as pairs and then collectively. After the alignment, the programme constructs a phylogenetic tree employing the neighbor-joining method. The VP1 of BD 3/99 and 17 other IBDV strains were aligned. These included three classical virulent, five classical attenuated, one antigenic variant, six very virulent and two serotype 2 strains ( Table 2 ). The VP1 sequence of an aquabirnavirus, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) Jasper strain (GeneBank accession no. M58756) [12] , was used as an outgroup in the construction of the phylogenetic tree. The length of VP1 is variable ( Table 2 ). The number of amino acids in VP1 is 881 in CEF 94, 879 in all very virulent strains and in Variant E, 878 in 002-73, Cu-1wt, Cu-1, Cu-1M, W2512, P2 and 23/82, and 876 in OH. For F 52/70, only a partial sequence was available. The discrepancy in length is due to three reasons: (i) the position of the stop codon is variable in different strains due to mutations of one or two nucleotides at the 3 -termimus of the VP1 gene; (ii) strains 002-73 and OH have scattered deletions of three nucleotides which also resulted in frameshift in the amino acid sequence between position 100 and 135; (iii) strain OH has additional deletions of two codons causing disappearance of two amino acids at positions 650 and 789 (numbering is according to Cu-1wt strain). Sequence distances data (Table 3 ) derived from the multiple alignment of the VP1 encoding nucleotide sequences revealed that all the very virulent strains are 97.5% to 99.8% identical. Similarly, with the exception of strain 002-73, all the classical virulent and attenuated strains are 98.2% to 100% identical. A very virulent strain differed from a classical virulent or attenuated strain within a range of 10.9% to 12.5%. The early Australian strain 002-74 was almost equally divergent (10.2% to 12.3%) from the other classical virulent or attenuated strains as well as very virulent strains. The Variant E strain was more close to the classical virulent or attenuated strains (97.5% to 97.9% identity). The VP1 of two serotype 2 strains, OH and 23/82, is 92.7% to 96.1% similar to the classical virulent or attenuated strains but only 87.5% to 89.9% similar to the very virulent strains.",

Among the 3 classical virulent strains, 002-73 appeared to be highly divergent having as many as 11 amino acid substitutions as compared to Cu-1wt. Only a partial sequence was available for F 52/70. In general, the VP1 sequence of the attenuated strains and the antigenic variant strain were similar to that of Cu-1wt. Only at position 13, all of the attenuated strains have unique Threonine instead of Lysine present in all other strains. At position 546, the attenuated strains and Cu-1wt have Leucine but all other strains have Proline. The amino acid residue at position 12 is highly variable irrespective of pathotype or serotype. It is interesting to note that as compared to Cu-1wt all the very virulent strains have 17 common amino acid substitutions. Out of these, 8 substitutions (Glu146Asp, Gly147Asn, Asp242Glu, Leu390Met, Glu393Asp, Ser562Pro, Ser687Pro and Lys695Arg) are unique to the very virulent strains only. The remaining 9 substitutions are also shared by either a classical virulent strain 002-73 and/or serotype 2 strains.",

The length of each pair of branches represents the distance between sequence pairs. The units at the bottom of the tree indicate the number of substitution events one would expect that the VP1 gene should remain well conserved. In fact, this is the case when the VP1 gene of serotype 1 classical virulent and attenuated strains and serotype 2 strains are compared. They show only 4-6% divergence (Table 3) . Surprisingly, the very virulent strains differ from the classical virulent and attenuated strains as well as serotype 2 strains at a level of 10.5% to 12.5% (Table 3) . However, a multiple alignment of the segment A polyprotein gene of the very virulent strains and classical virulent/attenuated strains would show less than 5% variation, while serotype 1 and serotype 2 strains would have as much as 18-20% divergence (unpublished observation). The 002-73 sequence was not taken into consideration for the statements made above because of its unique divergence from all other IBDV sequences. Nucleic acid polymerases show fundamental structural similarities reflected by distinct sequence motifs [19, 27] . Three or four most commonly found RdRp motifs are now considered to be involved in the polymerase activity in RNA viruses [15, 21, 29] . The first three well-conserved motifs are DXXXXD, S/TGXXXTXXXN, and G/SDD; the fourth motif is relatively less conserved but contains a single conserved residue R/K (essential residues are given in bold face, residues not in bold face are quite preserved but mutations are tolerated, X indicates any residue).

Although several very virulent IBDV-specific mutations have been identified in the capsid proteins, none has so far been implicated in enhanced virulence. The role of VP1 in the virulence of IBDV also has not yet been established. It is likely that the efficiency of the viral polymerase would influence the replication rate and, thus, the pathogenic potential of a virus. In an earlier study 17 common amino acid substitutions, including 8 unique substitutions, were observed in two very virulent IBDV strains (OKYM and UK 661) [37] . Interestingly, these substitutions are also observed in all the very virulent IBDV strains sequenced so far ( Table 4 ). The significance of these mutations is not known. None of these mutations is within any putative RdRp motif. However, the essential domain of the RdRp motif may extend beyond the consensus region and mutations in the vicinity of the RdRp motifs can influence the polymerase activity [30] . Out of 8 amino acid substitutions unique to very virulent IBDV, 3 were in the central region of the VP1 sequence where putative RdRp motifs are located (Fig. 1, Table 4 ). These are Leu390Met, Glu393Asp and Ser562Pro. All three mutations predict a minor shift in the hydrophilicity of the protein (data not shown). Site-directed mutational experiments will be required to elucidate if these mutations play any role in possible enhancement of the polymerase activity and, therefore, virulence of the virus. It is interesting to note that at amino acid position 13 all classical attenuated strains have a unique mutation (Lys13Thr). Any possible role of this mutation in attenuation of these strains deserves further investigation.",
