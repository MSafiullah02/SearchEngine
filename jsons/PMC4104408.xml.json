            "text": "WNV infection of mice has provided valuable insight into the pathogenesis of virus infection in humans (reviewed in [5]). Three distinct stages of WNV pathogenesis have been defined through studies in mice: initial infection and spread (early phase), peripheral virus amplification (viremic phase), and neuroinvasion (central nervous system (CNS) phase). The early phase is defined by WNV infection and replication at the site of inoculation, in keratinocytes [6\u2022], dermal dendritic cells and skin-resident Langerhans cells [7]. The viremic phase is defined by virus spread to the spleen, a primary site for peripheral virus replication, and non-productive infection of other peripheral organs (e.g. liver and kidney). During these first two stages, dendritic cells, macrophages, and possibly neutrophils are believed to be the key target cells of infection [8, 9, 10]. While the specific dendritic cell or macrophage subsets that amplify WNV in vivo have yet to be identified, genetic deletion of CD8+\u03b1 DCs or antibody-mediated depletion of macrophages lead to dysregulated host control of virus replication, increased mortality, and defects in adaptive immunity [9, 11\u2022\u2022, 12, 13]. The final stage involves WNV neuroinvasion into the central nervous system, where the virus targets and replicates in neuronal subsets. These distinct stages of pathogenesis are believed to recapitulate what occurs in humans following WNV transmission by a mosquito bite.",

            "text": "Following virus infection of a target host (i.e. humans infected with WNV), the immune system is rapidly engaged and drives antiviral immune responses necessary for controlling virus replication, limiting virus-mediated pathology, and providing immunity to re-infection (Figure 1a). Accordingly, the innate and adaptive immune systems are essential for providing protection against WNV infection [5]. In particular, type I IFN and related antiviral defenses are triggered following recognition of WNV infection and activation of the RIG-I like receptor (RLR), Toll-like receptor (TLR), and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways. Infection analysis of RIG-I\n\u2212/\u2212 or MDA5\n\u2212/\u2212 macrophages, dendritic cells and fibroblasts revealed that RIG-I is activated early during infection whereas MDA5 is required for enhancing and sustaining type I IFN and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression [14, 15, 16]. Furthermore, in vivo studies have demonstrated that RLR signaling is required for protection as well as controlling peripheral organ and CNS viral burden, limiting virus-mediated pathology, and programming protective immunity to WNV infection [5, 17]. Similarly, the TLRs [18, 19] and NLRs [20, 21] have been shown to restrict virus replication in a cell and tissue-specific manner and regulate protective CNS immunity during WNV infection. Additionally, components of the innate immune cellular responses, including natural killer cells [22, 23], neutrophils [8], and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [24], and cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune responses are critical for protection against WNV infection (as reviewed in greater detail in [5]). Studies in humans infected with WNV have been limited, however, certain risk factors for symptomatic infection outcome include advanced age, immunocompromised status [25], genetic factors [26, 27\u2022\u2022, 28], and reduced expansion of regulatory T cells [29\u2022].",

Specifically, these studies are designed to identify host factors can either directly antagonize a specific aspect of the viral life cycle (e.g. virus binding, entry, RNA synthesis, and budding) or indirectly by modulating the immune response. Gain-of-function based approaches typically involve ectopic expression of an individual host gene and evaluating the impact on virus replication. In these assays, a reduction in virus replication suggests an antiviral property associated with the gene of interest. These genes are then used in follow-up studies to determine the mechanism of action. An initial small-scale screen by Jiang and colleagues identified RSAD2 (also known as viperin) and ISG20 as cellular enzymes that efficiently suppress WNV infection [44]. In this analysis, over-expression of viperin and ISG20 suppressed WNV-replicon colony formation, suggesting that these antiviral proteins likely target viral RNA or protein biosynthesis. In a similar manner, Schoggins and colleagues screened more than 380 human genes and identified several additional interferon-stimulated genes, including pattern recognition receptors (RIG-I, MDA5, CGAS), transcription factors (IRF1, ATF3, IRF7), and uncharacterized antiviral genes (HPSE, NAMPT, PBEF1, SAA1, and PHF15) that were observed to restrict WNV infection [45].",

In this assay, an increase in virus replication indicates that the gene of interest possesses antiviral activity. Krishnan and colleagues used siRNAs targeting over 21 000 human genes to screen and identify cellular proteins associated with the early stages of WNV infection which include entry, viral RNA synthesis and translation. This study identified over 300 host proteins that impact WNV infection, of which 283 host genes were found to facilitate WNV infection and 22 host genes reduced WNV infection. In a similar analysis, Li and colleagues used shRNAs to screen 245 human ISGs and identified 47 host genes that negatively impacted WNV replication [46]. This list of ISGs includes previously identified genes (e.g. MAVS, STAT2, IRF1, IFITM2, and PKR) as well as novel ISGs such as DDX24, IFI44L, IFI6, TRIM21, and TRIM6. More recently, Yasunaga et al. used Drosophila to identify cell-intrinsic antiviral genes that restrict WNV infection [47]. This group performed a genome-wide high-content RNA interference screen in Drosophila cells that identified 50 host genes, that when silenced, enhanced WNV replication. Remarkably, many of these genes have defined human orthologs. Follow-up mechanistic analysis on a subset of the candidate genes, found that members of the Tip60 acetylase complex and dXPO1, which controls nuclear export of specific host mRNAs, possess antiviral activity against WNV infection. These high-throughput based screening assays have provided yet another avenue for identifying host genes involved in controlling WNV replication. However, for many of these host genes, the underlying mechanisms of viral control are not well characterized. Future studies should place a greater emphasis to define the mode of action of these anti-WNV ISGs.",

It is becoming increasingly evident that development of effective vaccines that provide life-long immunity requires a comprehensive understanding of the innate and adaptive immune response to virus infection [48]. In support, systems biology approaches have been used to identify molecular networks that regulate the immune response to vaccination in humans [48, 49]. Specifically, transcriptional analysis of blood from individuals vaccinated against yellow fever virus (YF-17D) [50] or influenza virus [51] identified molecular signatures that can predict the magnitude of the immune responses to a vaccine. These studies are beginning to pave the way toward the development of a \u2018vaccine chip\u2019 that could be used to predict vaccine-induced immunity [48, 49]. In summary, the use of these technologies will continue to provide valuable insight to overcoming current challenges that have hindered effective vaccine development and prophylactic treatment strategies to prevent or combat emerging and re-emerging virus infection.",
