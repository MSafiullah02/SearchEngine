Deep sequencing from lower respiratory tract samples confirmed infection was caused by a novel coronavirus that had previously not been found in humans or animals. Subsequently, this novel coronavirus was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness, and its main clinical manifestations are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue [2,3]. Not only patients with symptoms but also patients in the incubation period can become the source of infection. Therefore, early diagnosis is very important.",

Radiological examinations are relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and may demonstrate normal findings in early stage of infection. In contrast, thin-section chest CT examination plays a key role in assisting diagnosis. To date, considerable knowledge gaps remain in the chest CT imaging features of COVID-19.",

We conducted the meta-analysis using the transformed data. The pooled proportion was calculated using the result of the meta-analysis by the formula (P = (sin(tp/2))2). Statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with Cochran\u2019s Q test and the I\n2 statistic [4]. For the Q statistic, P < .10 was considered statistically significant for heterogeneity; for I\n2, a value >50% was considered to have severe heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by constructing a funnel plot and by Egger\u2019s test [5]. For Egger\u2019s test, P < .10 was considered statistically significant.
