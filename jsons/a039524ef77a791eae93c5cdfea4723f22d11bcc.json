How do paramedics describe the challenges and facilitators involved in responding to these situations? What are the skills they use to respond to these situations? The present study examined paramedics' experiences and perceptions regarding behavioral health emergencies, aiming to address a significant gap in the literature on paramedics' ability to respond to the needs of individuals experiencing behavioral health crises.",

            "text": "Limited research based in the UK, Europe, and Australia has examined the extent to which paramedics feel equipped by their training to respond to situations of a behavioral health nature, with a marked lack of USA-based research in this area. In a survey of members of the College of Paramedics (UK), 98% of the 623 respondents endorsed the need for increased mental health education and training. 2 Paramedic training curriculums in the UK have evolved to incorporate more of an emphasis on behavioral health, yet whether or not this behavioral health training is effective has not yet been investigated. 1 Several Australian studies investigated paramedic perceptions of their mental health training and decision-making during mental health emergencies. 5, 8 Paramedic participants reported inadequate mental health training and indicated a need for increased education on mental illness, particularly regarding possible treatment options that are feasible as part of prehospital care. 8 Paramedics described relying more on intuition than education when faced with challenging cases. 5 In a mixed methods study, Australian paramedics reported the need for more education on how to adequately respond to older adults experiencing complex mental health crises including depression, social isolation, and food insecurity. 7 Limited research has explored paramedic perceptions, attitudes, and experiences responding to behavioral health emergencies, but the existing research indicates that many emergency healthcare providers consider physical health emergencies more valuable or important than behavioral health emergencies. [8] [9] [10] Studies indicate that paramedic students do not consider training in mental health issues as relevant to the profession, 1 with an Australian study of paramedic undergraduate students indicating a lower level of regard for those with intellectual disabilities, substance abuse disorders, or acute mental illness compared to students studying in other health professions. 11 A multi-site, qualitative study based in Paris, France and New York, New York examined how social and professional values influenced prehospital emergency workers' responses. 9 The authors found that patients deemed to have lower social value were lower priority to emergency providers, with cases involving substance use or calls from lower socioeconomic areas, for instance, regarded as less legitimate uses of emergency services. 9 Notably, situations that required more complex or heroic medical or surgical actions were also attributed higher value by emergency healthcare workers. 9 Greater importance was attributed to medical (versus behavioral health) emergencies across additional studies, with paramedic participants implying that behavioral health calls were not valid emergencies, 5 and with paramedic participants indicating that their role is mainly to transport-not to treat-individuals experiencing behavioral health crises. 8 Additionally, paramedic participants perceived their services as often used inappropriately for behavioral health emergencies due to the limited availability of more appropriate behavioral health services. 8 Related research regarding the perceptions of emergency department physicians and nurses in the USA also revealed a greater value placed on physical versus behavioral health emergencies, as well as perceptions that certain crises (such as self-harm) were less valid, or less worthy of emergency treatment. 10 This is particularly concerning given that emergency department healthcare providers interact with a substantial number of persons seeking behavioral health emergency care: in 2015, approximately 4.1% of visits to an emergency department were related to diagnosed mental health disorders (approximately 5,666,000 visits). 12 The number of emergency department visits related to opioid overdose increased by 29.7% in the USA between July 2016 and September 2017. 13 Emergency healthcare workers are treating a significant number of behavioral health emergencies, rendering improved understanding of healthcare providers' perceptions and attitudes towards this population crucial.",

Early readings of the transcript data allowed the researchers to develop preliminary ideas regarding potential themes. Each researcher then thoroughly analyzed the individual transcripts, generating initial codes and beginning to search for themes both within and across documents. During this stage, the researchers met frequently to compare and contrast the results of each individual's analysis, reviewing emerging themes and collaborating to refine themes into a coherent set. To asses inter-rater reliability, two un-read transcripts were reviewed by all team members and coded independently, followed by meetings as a research team to compare coding decisions on each transcript and reconcile any discrepancies. This rigorous process helped to ensure strong inter-rater reliability as we were able to gain consensus in our coding process for all other transcripts. Researchers individually arranged transcript data verbatim into groups of initial themes, and a master document was then created collaboratively, which outlined each finalized theme and included transcript excerpts embodying each theme.",

Once certified, paramedics must undergo periodic recertification, which requires both exams and evidence of continuing education-this could be a key point of intervention for a robust behavioral health training. This data clearly demonstrates that the paramedic profession needs-and endorses the need for-additional behavioral health training: a review of paramedic education and training curriculums across the USA would aid understanding of how to improve upon current behavioral health education for paramedics. The effectiveness of fairly recently implemented behavioral health education for paramedics in the UK has not been investigated 1,4 -a similar gap appears to exist in the USA. Further research should evaluate existing behavioral health training for paramedics in order to better understand how current practices may be failing to adequately prepare paramedics in this area. Enhanced education and training on this subject has the potential to improve paramedics' ability to fully respond to the needs of patients in times of behavioral health crises. Although literature specifically focusing on prehospital providers is lacking, research on behavioral health training of emergency department providers indicates that such training has the potential to improve behavioral health care. 18 Training in behavioral health for medical professionals has traditionally been thought of as secondary or less important, in the context of all that one needs to learn to be a competent medical practitioner, 1 but as this study illustrates, interactions with patients who are having a behavioral health crisis are common and can be challenging. Improved behavioral health training, either in their time of certification or during times of recertification and continuing education, for paramedics may improve care for individuals experiencing behavioral health emergencies in the community and can be a key point of intervention.",

Further research could work to develop policies and procedures to help strengthen the referral mechanism between paramedics and behavioral health providers. Again, training would strengthen this referral link as training can increase the paramedic's capacity to identify behavioral health concerns more effectively, therefore increasing their capacity to refer with greater confidence. Structured and standardized behavioral health training could serve as a key point of intervention, improving job satisfaction for paramedics by enabling them to more confidently manage increasingly complex behavioral health calls, and most importantly, better serving individuals with behavioral health disorders. Improved capacity for care at the prehospital stage of intervention could potentially reduce unnecessary emergency room transfers and/or medical interventions for people experiencing behavioral health emergencies, reducing potential harm and preventing additional distress to the patients served, and ultimately benefitting the health care system as a whole.",
