The introduction of insurance coverage may provide some data in the future.

Estimates of the number of Americans seen at Bumrungrad in Bangkok range from 55,000 to 64,000 in 2006,8, 19 an 11% to 30% increase over 2005, and 83% of visits were for noncosmetic treatments.19 Approximately 850 United States patients were reportedly operated on in 2007 at two Wockhardt hospitals in Bangalore and Bombay, twice as many as in 2006.6 Another source estimates that 50,000 Americans travel each year for major noncosmetic surgery, such as joint replacement, coronary artery bypass, new or repaired heart valves, and back repair.20 As these are nonemergent, elective procedures it is not yet possible to determine if the recent fluctuations noted here and in Fig. 1 reflect true trends or events in the airline and travel industries. For example, following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, travel to Asia was reduced in 2004 and travel may have been postponed, with a subsequent rebound of the accumulated number of trips in 2005 and 2006.",

The employer-based rebate plan,7 which formed the basis of the West Virginia proposal, was reportedly discontinued by the next year because of displeasure voiced by the employee union.30 The Internal Revenue Service has also taken note: amounts paid by a group health plan for medical procedures are not taxable to employees, but the issues are less clear around provision of lodging, transportation, and even the cash rebates in self-insured or fully-insured situations.30\n",

There are issues related to whether a local physician at the patient's home will be comfortable or not providing immediate postprocedure follow-up, but that would also be true if a the patient traveled to another part of the United States.

For India it has been postulated that the quality of the local medical schools, a low cost of living, family preferences, and the barriers to foreign accreditation may mean that Indian doctors may prefer to work in India rather than elsewhere, allowing this growth in patient-care capacity.3 The fact that English is commonly spoken and that many of the clinicians trained in institutions familiar to their North American patients are both factors in site selection by United States-born patients, who may have never traveled internationally before.3, 7, 8\n",

            "text": "In the United States, there is a single system for organ procurement and transplantation coordinated under congressional mandate by the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit, scientific, and educational organization. As of July 18, 2008, there were 9,029 transplants between January and April from 4,578 donors with 99,393 candidates on the waiting list (www.optn.org). The need for transplantable organs far exceeds the available supply and travel to a country with less rigorous methods of distribution has been termed \u201ctransplant tourism\u201d or \u201corgan trafficking.\u201d51 The 2007 United States Annual Report includes a study by Marion and colleagues, that has been published separately,52 on transplant tourism. It examines transplants in foreign countries among patients removed from the United States waiting list from 1986 to 2006. Patients are removed from the US waiting list when they receive a transplant in the United States, die before receiving a transplant, or they can self-elect to remove their name from the list to seek care outside the United States. The majority (89.3%) of the 373 foreign transplants were kidney. Between 2001 and 2006 the annual number of waiting-list removals increased. Recipients of foreign transplants were significantly more likely to be male, college educated, nonresident or resident alien, and 10 times more likely to be Asian and self-funded. Forty-two percent of the transplants occurred in East Asia and the Pacific, with three countries accounting for one half of all foreign transplants: China (26%), Philippines (12%), and India (10%). The report states \u201c\u2026it is possible and indeed probable that instances of organ buying, selling, and/or trafficking outside the U.S. occurred. On the other hand, bona fide emotionally and/or biologically related living donor transplants were likely done. For example, U.S. citizens as well as resident and non-resident aliens may have friends or relatives in their country of origin who are unable to come to the U.S. to donate because of restrictive policies governing the issuance of travel visas.\u201d Conversely, an analysis of kidney and liver transplants to nonresident aliens in the United States, although small in number, shows that these liver candidates had shorter times to transplant and the self paying had the shortest time.53 In an accompanying commentary entitled \u201c\u2018Transplant Tourism\u2019 in the United States?\u201d the author makes the point that foreign nationals are paying for access to organs, which should cause inward reflection on condemnation of other transplant enterprises. It also demonstrates that the developed world has the opportunity to measure and report on the extent of the behavior and provide outcome results. The author also notes that the National Task Force on Transplantation that developed the United States system in 1986 stated that deceased donor organs were a \u201cnational resource,\u201d but did not envision the globalization that has transpired in the interim. Shortages are a universal problem and reliance on deceased organs, even in a well-developed program such as Spain's, can only meet 50% of the demand. Thus, other models involving living donors, which could be regulated, prevent organ vending, and protect the donor, have been proposed for discussion in a series of recent articles.54, 55, 56 Transparency, where there is so much potential to exploit, is key.56, 57, 58\n",

One United States center identified 10 patients who underwent transplantation outside the United States during the period September 16, 2002 to June 30, 2006, and returned to the same center for care. Three patients had indicated they intended to seek transplantation abroad. Two patients were seen in the emergency room on the day of arrival in the United States. Complications were primarily infectious, with six infections in four patients: severe wound infection with acinetobacter (one); sepsis (three); cytomegalovirus (CMV) (one); and central nervous system aspergillus (one). Nine of the 10 grafts survived, as did 9 of the 10 patients, which is consistent with results obtained for patients transplanted in the United States and from a much larger series of patients, who had also traveled for the purpose of transplantation, reported on from Malaysia (n = 515) at about the same time.59, 60 However, an Australian series of 16 patients who had traveled overseas for commercial transplantation had survival rates at 1 and 5 years that were lower when compared with Australian living-donor transplants.61 Two of the 16 contracted Hepatitis B virus (HBV) abroad, three were hospitalized for acute CMV infection shortly after return home, and one had aspergillus infection of the graft and multiresistant Pseudomona aeruginosa of the surgical wounds. In the Malaysian study there were significant rates of infection, but they did not differ between the living related donor (n = 258) transplanted in Malaysia, the commercial living donor (n = 389), or commercial cadaveric donor (n = 126) transplanted abroad. The infection rates were: bacterial <=35%; viral <=26%; HCV <=17%; HBV <=12%; fungal <=7%; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CMV and malaria <5%. There were no HIV infections. Case reports such as this are affected by survivorship bias related to those patients who did not return for unknown reasons, and differences of endemic rates of infection in the population with such agents as HBV. One must be careful to examine the year of study when comparing rates of infection with HIV, as prior studies may include patients transplanted in early time periods.61\n",

Treatment for the septic joint, with an organism not commonly encountered in Australia, involved four separate surgeries and antimycobacterial therapy, resulting in a cost of $140,000. The procedure had been done in a hospital accredited by the JCI, rates of infection in the procedure worldwide are known to be 1% to 2%, and it was acknowledged that even if 1 patient in 20 develops an infection, having the operation overseas is an economically viable option. However, the case illustrates many of the issues in medical tourism: exposure to infections of different types or higher prevalence than at home, the lack of ability to address the root source of adverse events and effect change, the wisdom of undertaking major surgery away from one's home environment (especially when long-haul air travel before major surgery significantly increases the risk of perioperative venous thromboembolism74), and in the event a complication does occur, the fairness of using resources that could fund procedures for multiple patients to treat one who had disregarded medical advice. Patients in this situation have little legal recourse75 and may also encounter a radically different cultural framework of reference, based in part on the local perception of an individual's decision to seek care away from home. The president of the Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons of Thailand is quoted as saying that all plastic surgery is \u201cimprovement not perfection,\u201d and patients must realize there are drawbacks to traveling to another country for medical care. \u201cHow can a doctor look after patients if they go back to their country?

For example, many of the same countries profiled as top destinations for medical tourists seeking care are also profiled on the American College of Surgeons Web site link (www.operationgivingback.facs.org), where health care professionals at all stages of their surgical career can search for opportunities to volunteer as the other type of medical tourist, the health care worker who travels to provide medical care. New Orleans is also on the list of destinations, and as the Web site is open source, international surgeons could consider volunteer opportunities in the United States best suited to their expertise and interests here. However, regardless of their level of skill, physicians and surgeons interested in providing medical care in other countries may face legal barriers regarding licensing, structures that have been put in place to establish standards with the goal of protecting patients. Health care that involves invasive procedures is not without risk even in developed countries. The recent investigation of hepatitis C at an endoscopy clinic in Las Vegas has demonstrated how standards are necessary but not sufficient, even in developed areas.77 Recognition of the common source and subsequent gaps in basic infection-control practices were possible because, as a result of vaccination, rates of hepatitis in the United States have declined to the point where individual cases can be investigated.78 These public health and legal checks and balances provide valuable insight but also add to health care costs,79 and although outbreaks receive wide attention, the majority of cases of hepatitis in the United States are now imported by travelers from developing parts of the world.78\n",

Medical tourism demonstrates how dynamic the boundaries of the village seem to be and how transit between countries, particularly between country of birth and country of residence, affects health in both areas. The patient having a check-up before visiting a child studying abroad may also plan to have major dental procedures and be of an age to have missed both natural exposure and vaccination programs for hepatitis A or B, be unaware of prevalence rate and vaccination practices at the destination, and be convinced that he or she can tell whether the facility is safe just \u201cby looking,\u201d particularly when significant cost savings are at stake. The field is changing constantly; some international sites now describe care not just for adults but children, particularly for what are perceived as cosmetic procedures, such as orthodontics.22 Physicians should either be familiar with up-to-date sources of information (eg, www.cdc.gov/travel) or referral options, and inquire whether or what role travel plays in their patient's life.",
