Our result revealed that the attenuated strain presented a decreased pathogenicity in 1-day-old chickens. The strain ZYY-2014 inoculated birds presented typical IBV clinical signs with a mortality of 43%, while the attenuated strain ZYYR-2014 inoculated birds remained healthy. The strain ZYYR-2014 also presented stronger antibody responses and lower viral loads in tracheas, lungs and kidneys.
