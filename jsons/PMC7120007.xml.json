But if the macrophage is not able to contain the infection or the bacillus is highly virulent, MTB multiplies multifold before the macrophage bursts. Release of various cytokines by the macrophages attracts further macrophages which phagocytose the released MTB (Knechel 2009). In the first 2\u20133 weeks, development of T cell-mediated immunity causes activation of macrophages which then destroy the MTB within them (van Crevel et al. 2002). This causes the formation of a typical granuloma with a caseation necrosis in the lungs and the draining lymph nodes. This attributes to the typical imaging features in primary TB.

As a result of the formation of this communication with airways, air enters the lung parenchyma in this area of consolidation, forming what is a typical lesion of the secondary TB, that is, a cavity. As the contents of the cavity are discharged into the bronchus, the patient develops cough with expectoration. Spread of these discharges into the airways may also give rise to typical imaging appearance of endobronchial spread.

Decubitus views to demonstrate the mobility of the intracavitary mass are helpful in doubtful cases. Pathologically, the lesion comprises of fungal hyphae intermixed with varying amounts of mucous and cellular debris. On CT, a soft tissue attenuation lesion located within a cavity is typical (Fig. 32). Thickening of the walls of the cavity and that of the adjacent pleura is described. This thickening may be the earliest sign of aspergillosis, even before any visible changes in the cavity are seen. It represents a hypersensitivity reaction rather than a fibrosis and is reversible with treatment (Franquet et al. 2000).\n",

Other CT findings include air bronchogram within nodules (Fig. 47), focal consolidations, lung abscesses (Fig. 48), and halo signs. About 70 % of the lesions are generally located just beneath the pleura (Fig. 49) and about feeding vessels (Fig. 50). It was reported that radiographic evidence of a nodular density suspended in a thinly walled hyperlucent cavity is characteristic of septic pulmonary emboli (Yoong and Cheong 1997; Iwasaki et al. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
