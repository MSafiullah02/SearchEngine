With respect to outbreak response, WHO should focus on four core functions: supporting national capacity building through technical advice; rapid early response and assessment of outbreaks (including potential emergency declarations); establishing technical norms, standards, and guidance; and convening the global community to set goals, mobilise resources, and negotiate rules. Beyond outbreaks, WHO should maintain its broad definition of health but substantially scale back its expansive range of activities to focus on core functions (to be defined through a process launched by the WHO Executive Board).\u2022Recommendation 10: The Executive Board should mandate good governance reforms, including establishing a freedom of information policy, an Inspector General's office, and human resource management reform, all to be implemented by an Interim Deputy for Managerial Reform by July 2017. In exchange for successful reforms, governments should finance most of the budget with untied funds in a new deal for a more focused WHO.

That month, both Guinea and Liberia confirmed Ebola outbreaks to WHO. By March 24, Ebola was confirmed in Conakry, home to more than one in seven Guineans. Two months later Ebola had spread to three capital cities with international airports. Without any approved drugs, vaccines or rapid diagnostic tests, health workers struggled to diagnose patients and provide effective care. Without sufficient protective gear, and initially without widespread understanding of the virus, hundreds of health workers themselves became ill and died. Despite M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res' warnings about the unprecedented scope of the outbreak,12 national authorities in Guinea downplayed it for fear of creating panic and disrupting economic activity.12, 13 Internal documents14 suggest similar concerns might have influenced WHO, which publicly characterised the outbreak in March as \u201crelatively small still\u201d.15 WHO's Global Alert and Response Network sent an expert team to support national efforts, as did others such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, those teams withdrew from Guinea and Liberia in May when reported cases decreased, even as viral transmission continued.16 In late May, Sierra Leone became the third country to declare an Ebola outbreak to WHO. For the first time in the known history of Ebola, the virus had spawned sustained outbreaks in three countries. This should have raised substantial alarm, as coordination was weak between the national governments of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, the borders extremely porous, and human movement and trade highly fluid. In late June, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res labelled the situation as \u201cout of control\u201d and publicly called for more international attention and resources.17\n",

Nevertheless, rapid information sharing, and mobilisation of health workers for contact tracing and patient care had limited the outbreak in Senegal to one confirmed infection.35 In Nigeria, the Nigerian Center for Disease Control, previous experience with polio eradication efforts and a lead poisoning emergency were all cited as important factors in successful control of the outbreak in Africa's most populous country.36 By the end of January, 2015, more than $5 billion had been committed for the Ebola response (although the proportion of these funds actually spent on Ebola and in the affected countries remains unclear).37 Research and development efforts were quickly operationalised despite uncertainty on processes for regulatory approval, with at least three vaccine candidates, three blood products, and five drug candidates in clinical trials, with WHO playing a coordinating role.38 During this phase, the binding constraints were no longer political attention, funding, or human resources, but operational coordination, accountability for effective use of funds, and maintaining momentum to prevent new infections.",

Several non-governmental organisations vocally advocated for a stronger global response, treated patients, trained health workers, supported community mobilisation and longer-term recovery efforts. Additionally to massive funding from traditional donors, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, Cuba, and China made substantial contributions of personnel, funding, logistics, and technology (Huang Y, Council on Foreign Relations, personal communication).40 Private foundations and companies contributed funds, with $245 million from the top five contributors, along with meaningful in-kind assistance, such as air lifts.3 The initiation and conduct of clinical trials were accelerated amidst the challenging conditions of an outbreak, enabled by the cooperative efforts of industry, research funders, regulatory authorities in the USA, Europe, and west Africa, scientists, and directly affected communities.",

A true recovery will need far greater willingness by member states to entrust resources and delegate authority to WHO, but it has rarely been in a weaker position to command such trust and authority. Confidence in the organisation's capacity to lead is at an all-time low. Calling for additional staff or a larger budget will not address this. WHO must find a way to prioritise what it does, and regain its credibility, independence, and legitimacy to perform its core functions (table). Breaking out of this 20-year impasse will demand clear commitment and a different kind of leadership by WHO to implement fundamental reforms under a tight timeline, matched by an equally clear commitment by member states to reward such reform with appropriate authority and resources. WHO performed a key coordinating function in research and development during the Ebola epidemic. It was also central to controlling nine previous Ebola outbreaks, SARS, and other epidemics. These examples are important reminders of what WHO can do under determined leadership. WHO is in a formal reform process that was spurred by a budget crisis in 2011; in some ways, it has been in a perennial process of reform since at least the 1990s. These previous efforts are a reminder that high-level political leadership, such as the engagement of heads of state, will be needed if the outcome is to be different this time. At this point, anything less than fundamental reform will mean continued marginalisation and decline, alongside increasing vulnerability for global public health.",

The scope of WHO's work would thus continue to embrace the full range of health issues, but its functions should be far more circumscribed. We restrict our analysis to core functions in infectious disease outbreaks. However, there remains the need to define WHO's core functions in other key areas of work, such as non-communicable diseases, injuries, environmental health, health systems, and social determinants of health. For this purpose, the January 2016 Executive Board should launch a fundamental review of the organisation's constitution and mandate to define its core functions. This review should identify and hand over non-core activities to other actors, thereby streamlining WHO's activities. It should also examine which core functions are not being fulfilled or adequately funded.",

Preventing small outbreaks from becoming large-scale emergencies demands investment in minimum capacities in all countries and encouragement of early international reporting of outbreaks by adhering to agreed international rules. Responding effectively to outbreaks demands much stronger operational capacity within WHO and within the broader aid system if outbreaks escalate into humanitarian emergencies, a politically protected process for WHO's emergency declarations, and strong mechanisms for the accountability of all involved actors, from national governments to non-governmental organisations and from UN agencies to the private sector. Mobilisation of the knowledge needed to combat outbreaks will require an international framework of rules to enable, govern, and ensure access to the benefits of research, and financing to develop technology when commercial incentives are inappropriate. Finally, effective governance of this complex global system demands high-level political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose credibility is restored through the implementation of good governance reforms and assertive leadership.Panel 3Summary of recommendations\nPreventing major outbreaks\n\n1.Develop a global strategy to invest in, monitor, and sustain national core capacities2.Strengthen incentives for early reporting of outbreaks and science-based justifications for trade and travel restrictions\n\nResponding to major outbreaks\n\n3.Create a unified WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response with clear responsibility, adequate capacity, and strong lines of accountability4.Broaden responsibility for emergency declarations to a transparent, politically protected Standing Emergency Committee5.Institutionalise accountability by creating an independent Accountability Commission for Disease Outbreak Prevention and Response\n\nResearch: producing and sharing data, knowledge, and technology\n\n6.Develop a framework of rules to enable, govern, and ensure access to the benefits of research7.Establish a global facility to finance, accelerate, and prioritise research and development\n\nGoverning the global system\n\n8.Sustain high-level political attention through a Global Health Committee of the Security Council9.A new deal for a more focused, appropriately financed WHO10.Good governance of WHO through decisive, time bound reform and assertive leadership\n",

The creation of a Standing Emergency Committee would replace the current ad hoc International Health Regulation Emergency Committee. The Standing Emergency Committee will meet and receive information from the Emergency Centre regularly, with the mandate to declare a public health emergency of international concern by a majority vote of its members.
