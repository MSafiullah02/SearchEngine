Besides the host innate immune defence ensured by hundred of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) which can be rapidly mobilized to neutralize viruses [3], innate pathogen recognition is mediated by dozens of soluble, membrane bound or cytosolic germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which detect conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [4]. Soluble serum PRRs include collectins, ficolins and pentraxins that may opsonise viruses leading to their complement-dependent destruction. Membrane-bound endocytic/phagocytic PRRs, including the mannose receptor (MR), scavenger receptors (SR), and dendritic cell-specific ICAM grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) may also directly recognize viruses to mediate virus uptake.",

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-expressed signaling PRRs: while TLR1/2/4/5/6/10 are distributed on the cell surface, TR3/7/8/9 are located within endosomal compartments [5]. Detection of cytosolic-located PAMPs can be achieved by specific PRRs which include the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLR), RIG-I and MDA5 [4]. Following recognition of viral PAMPs, these PRRs transduce intracellular signals to activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and/or type I IFN (IFN-I) regulatory transcription factors (IRF)3 and/or IRF7, leading to proinflammatory cytokine and IFN-I expression by the infected cells. Newly synthesized IFN-I is secreted and binds to IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN stimulating genes (ISGs) with direct anti-viral effect [4].",

MBL binds to carbohydrates on the surface of a wide range of pathogens and activates the lectin pathway of complement. However, the degree of glycosylation of viral glycoproteins is a general factor in determining sensitivity to MBL recognition (Figure 1\n). For example, the sensitivity to MBL detection of seasonal H1N1 strains of influenza virus (highly sensitive) and A (H1N1) pandemic viruses (poorly sensitive), is depending on the extent of glycosylation of their respective hemagglutinin (HA). The loss of a single N-linked glycan from the HA of influenza virus is associated with resistance to MBL detection and increased virulence [7\u2022]. MBL can also bind to high-mannose glycans on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 [8]; the level of glycosylation of gp120 is variable, depending on infected cell [9] what might allow prevention of MBL binding.",

            "text": "Phagocytosis is an innate defence system of specialized phagocytes, i.e. macrophages, neutrophiles and DC, first described more than 120 years ago by Ilya Ilitch Metchnikov (Nobel prize in medicine 1908) [14]. It is only recently that this process appeared as a mechanism promoting virus entry. Adenovirus targeted to the Fc\u03b3 receptor 1 of hematopoietic cells gives rise not only to adenovirus aggregates which are phagocytosed, but also to single particles which enter into the cells by endocytosis [15]. Interestingly, both phagocytosis and endocytosis of adenoviruses were shown to cooperate in order to optimize viral gene delivery. Thus, phagocytosis might facilitate entry of aggregated viruses, but not the one of single particles. However, virus phagocytosis was also reported by Clement et al. who have shown that plasma membrane protrusions of fibroblastic cells are formed around entering herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 that further enter cells in phagocytosis-like particles [16]. A recent study has shown that the additional binding to the \u03b1V\u03b23-integrin routes HSV-1 to an acidic vesicular compartment [17\u2022\u2022]. In regard to the role of integrins in phagocytosis [18], it might be determined whether the \u03b1V\u03b23-integrin routes HSV-1 through phagosome-like vesicles. Finally, the giant mimivirus was also shown to use phagocytosis to infect macrophages [19]. Although the big size of mimiviruses may explain why they evolved to subvert phagocytosis, this cellular process might be usurped by other viruses.",

SR-BI, a class B SR, which binds a variety of lipoproteins (high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL)), is utilized by HCV to gain entry into hepatocytes (Figure 1). SR-BI binds the envelope E2 glycoprotein of HCV [29]. However, HCV may be associated with the serum factors LDL and HDL. These associations shield the virus from neutralizing antibodies. However, LDL/HDL on HCV could bind SR-BI and contribute to viral entry [30\u2022\u2022]. HDL improves HCV entry by accelerating SR-BI-mediated endocytosis, and HCV and HDL binding to SR-BI, as well as the lipid transfer activities of SR-BI, are required for SR-BI involvement in HCV entry [31, 32]. Interestingly, the SR-BI-dependent recognition of HCV by dendritic cells leads to cross-presentation of viral antigens what might contribute to elicit an host CD8+ T cell anti-HCV response [33].",

Nevertheless, the list of viruses recognized by or signaling from cell surface TLR (TLR2 and TLR4), is growing: wild-type measles virus (MeV) [40], the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [41], CMV [42], HSV-1 [43], mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) [44], Epstein-bar virus (EBV) [45], lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [46], mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-68) [47], vaccinia virus (VV) [48], and human rhinovirus (HRV)6 [49].

Only examples of direct modulation of RIG-I by virus-incorporated proteins were yet reported (Figure 2). RIG-I detects unique 5\u2032 triphosphate on virus genomic RNA and triggers IFN-I induction [54]. RNA viruses elicit IFN-I production upon RIG-I recognition soon after virus entry and delivery of their genome inside the cytosol. However, it was shown that genomic RNAs of several emergent double-stranded (ds)RNA viruses evade RIG-I detection because of the cleavage of triphosphates at the RNA 5\u2032 end, by a viral function [55]. Beyond, virion-incorporated proteins such as ebola-VP35 can also prevent RIG-I-mediated detection by competing for RNA genome interaction [56]. Another mechanism for direct RIG-I modulation was recently described with the protease of HIV-1 which promotes the lysosomal degradation of RIG-I [57]. Moreover, immunoglobulin-dependent dengue virus entry into immunoglobulin Fc region receptor (FcR)-bearing cells promotes activation of hydroxyacetone kinase and autophagy-related genes (ATG)5-ATG12, which disrupt the RIG-I and MDA-5 signaling cascade and prevent IFN-I production [58].",

The immediate-early (IE)62 protein is an abundant tegument protein of the alphaherpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV). IE62 promotes inactivation of IRF3 by preventing its phosphorylation by TANK-binding kinase (TBK)1 [59\u2022]. Moreover, although IE62 is not able to interact with TBK1 or IRF3, unproductive TBK1-IRF3 complexes are maintained, limiting the redistribution of trapped-TBK1 to activate other IRF3 substrates. Another example is the phosphoprotein P of rabies virus that binds to the ribonucleoprotein of free virions, which prevent TBK1 dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 [60]. Similarly, ebola virus VP35 also inactivates IRF3 [61] and the nucleoprotein of LCMV dampens IFN-I induction by preventing IRF3 activation [62].",

            "text": "Autophagy is a catabolic lysosomal mechanism which plays a crucial role as an innate defence mechanism by promoting virus or virus-derived component degradation and delivery of virus RNA to TLR-containing endosomes leading to IFN-I induction [69, 70]. However, several viruses evolved strategies to avoid or usurp autophagy to their own benefit [71]. Although the manipulation of autophagy upon virus entry to improve infectivity was not yet reported, several studies reported autophagy induction upon virus receptor engagement (Figure 2). Vaccine MeV entry induces autophagy through the direct engagement of the regulatory complement activation receptor CD46 [72\u2022\u2022], a receptor also for human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) and several serotypes of adenoviruses [73, 74]. Although CD46-mediated autophagy induction does not enhance MeV entry [72\u2022\u2022], whether MeV benefits from autophagy induction to replicate is not yet known. TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7, PRRs that recognize virus genome PAMPs, were also reported to induce autophagy upon ligand binding [75], what might be hijacked by some viruses to promote their own replication. Moreover, it is also shown that autophagy-associated proteins can be recruited to nascent phagosomes and accelerate phagosome maturation [76]. Moreover, clathrin-associated plasma membrane contributes to the formation of autophagosomes [77\u2022\u2022]. Since phagocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis are both involved in virus entry, their links with autophagy proteins or with the entire autophagy process, respectively, might benefit for virus entry/replication. Further studies are required to determine whether viruses induce/use autophagy or autophagy-associated proteins upon entry to enhance entry and infectivity.",
