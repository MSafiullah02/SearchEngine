            "text": "Most time series measured over continuous range assume a normal error distribution. These traditional time series models are however vulnerable to outliers. Outlier in time series has been realized as an influential factor in model fitting and forecasting. Failure to downweigh the outlying effects may lead to a poor model fit, an overestimation of variance, an inappropriate interpretation and an inaccurate prediction. This issue has received a great deal of attention, therefore several approaches have been developed to reduce the influence of outliers and the distributional deviation in the data analysis. Over the past decades, two main approaches are considered to cope with the overdispersion caused by the outliers. The first approach simply incorporates mixture effects to account for the heterogeneity in the distribution of the data. This can be viewed as a missing data problem assuming that the membership of the data from one of the distributions is unknown and has to be estimated. The mixture model is usually implemented using expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm.",

            "text": "The second approach is to adopt a heavy-tailed distribution instead of the commonly used Gaussian distribution as the error distribution of the data. Some popular choices of heavy-tailed distributions include the Student\u2019s t-distribution and a more general class of distributions is the Pearson Type IV distribution (Johnson et al., 1995). Alternatively, the exponential power (EP) distribution which can describe a leptokurtic (positive excess kurtosis) or platykurtic (negative excess kurtosis) shape is another good choice. However, the implementation of these distributions is difficult because the derivation of the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters is intractable using conventional numerical and analytic approximations (Choy and Smith, 1997). To overcome this problem, Box and Tiao (1973) proposed a new exponential power family of normal scale mixtures (SMN) and later Qin et al. (1998) pioneered the scale mixtures of uniform (SMU) which replaced the normal distribution in the SMN form by uniform distribution. Theoretically, any distribution that can be expressed by SMN form, also has a SMU representation.",

The recent emergence of the software WinBUGS which performs the Bayesian statistical inferences using MCMC algorithms also facilitates the implementation of these representations, thus enhancing their popularity in the context of Bayesian modelling. This hierarchical structure is very practical in insurance applications because it is well known that the normal error distribution falls short of allowing for irregular and extreme claims and hence contaminates the estimation procedure and leads to poor estimation. For instances, Choy and Chan (2003) applied the Student\u2019s t- and EP distributions in SM representations to predict the insurance premiums to be charged on the policyholders in credibility analysis and Chan et al. (2008) predicted and projected the loss reserves data with various heavy-tailed distributions under the generalized-t distribution family expressed in SMU representation.",

Yet, discrete count time series is observed in many occasions especially in a medical context. In clinical trials, patients usually have longitudinal measurements and sometimes the appearance of outlying observations in the data set may inflate the mean and variance of the data distribution and have an adverse effect on both the parameter estimation and prediction. Despite overdispersion, trend is often observed in time series and examining the trend patterns provides useful information on the movement of outcomes over time.",

            "text": "To cope with this problem, Thall and Vail (1990) proposed adding cluster-specific and time-specific random effects into the mean link function to give extra-Poisson variation to the data. Thereon, Jowaheer and Sutradhar (2002) incorporated the gamma random effects in the Poisson mixed model and later, Jowaheer et al. (2009) adopted a Poisson mixed model with two independent sources of normal random effects to deal with the problem. Nevertheless, the mixed effects approach which assumes the mean of the Poisson distribution follows gamma or log-normal distribution maybe inadequate to cast light on the outlying effect caused by the extreme observations. To tackle this pitfall, plenty of researches tried various mixing distributions. Some useful ones include generalized inverse Gaussian, generalized gamma, generalized exponential, inverse gamma, etc. Refer to (Gupta and Ong, 2005) for more details. In this paper, we seek a new direction to model overdispersed longitudinally time series of counts due to the presence of outliers. Our proposed model is an extension of the generalized mixture Poisson geometric process (GMPGP) model proposed by Wan and Chan (2009) which is developed from the geometric process (GP) model originated by Lam, 1988a, Lam, 1988b. The GMPGP model is a two-component mixture model with a mean function to analyze the covariate effect and a ratio function to describe the time effect. Meanwhile, the mixture effects in both mean and ratio functions can capture the population heterogeneity and overdispersion in the data. See Wan (2006) and Wan and Chan (2009) for more details. In this paper, we introduce a robust mixture Poisson geometric process (RMPGP) model using some heavy-tailed distributions in scale mixture representation. We assume that the outcome variable has a Poisson distribution with a stochastic mean which forms a latent GP, and the mean of the GP after geometrically discounted by the ratio follows a heavy-tailed distribution such as log-t distribution or log\u2013exponential power (log\u2013EP) distribution represented in SMN and SMU forms respectively. Under the scale mixture representation, the model parameters can be simulated using the MCMC algorithms and the mixing parameters help to identify the extreme values in the outlier diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is a pioneering work in adopting Student\u2019s t- or EP distributions for Poisson time series. Besides, our proposed GP models have a trend component (ratio function) which enables the study of trends of the outcomes over time and can accommodate the clustering effect using a mixture of homogeneous distributions. These make our model more advantageous than many existing Poisson time series models.",

The data were collected from a clinical trial of 59 epileptics by Leppik et al. (1985). In the randomized controlled trial, m=59 patients suffering from simple or complex partial seizures were assigned to either an antiepileptic drug progabide (z\u03bci1=1) or a placebo (z\u03bci1=0) with no intrinsic therapeutic value. The seizure counts were recorded at a two-week interval for an eight-week period (ni=4) with no dropout or missing cases. As shown in Table 4\n, the seizure counts exhibit a prominent extra-Poisson variation with large variance to mean ratios at all time t due to some outlying observations as displayed in Fig. 4\n(a) and (b). To assess the overdispersion in the data, we fit a simple Poisson regression model using a mean link function \u03b7it=exp(\u03b20+\u03b21z\u03bci1+\u03b22t) and a PGP model using a mean function \u03bcit=exp(\u03b2\u03bc0+\u03b2\u03bc1z\u03bci1) and a ratio function ait=exp(\u03b2a0+\u03b2a1t). The mean and variance under both models (indicated by \u2018 \u2217\u2019 in Table 4) are equivalent and are given by \u03b7it and \u03bcitaitt\u22121 respectively. Obviously, neither of the two simple models, as restricted by their equidispersed property, can capture the overdispersion. Besides, the higher mean seizure counts of the placebo group indicate that \u2018treatment group\u2019 is a feasible covariate. Moreover, the gradually decreasing seizure counts over time for both placebo and progabide groups suggests that time t maybe a possible time-evolving effect. In addition, population heterogeneity in terms of trend pattern and count level are also detected intuitively. In consideration of these and the clinical interest of examining trend patterns, we adopt the RMPGP models to analyze the epilepsy data.",

The negative \u03b2\u03bc1 in both RPGP models indicate the treatment effect that patients receiving progabide are associated with lower seizure counts. However, within the treatment group, it is explicit that some of these patients have abnormally high seizure counts. Simply fitting a simple RPGP model may fail to allow for the clustering effect among patients receiving the same treatment. We therefore fitted a 2-group RMPGP model and also attempted to fit a 3-group RMPGP model using both Student\u2019s t- and EP distributions but the results indicated that one of the groups in the 3-group RMPGP model degenerated and hence the models were discarded.",

A plausible explanation is that the EP distribution has a more flexible tail behaviour and thus provides a better fit to the data. To further investigate this, their observed and fitted pmfs for the low-level group are illustrated in Fig. 5\n(a)\u2013(d) at different time points, in which the observed pmf ftl(w) for group l at time t is generally given by (19)ftl(w)=\u2211b=0,1\u03c8b{\u2211i=1mI\u00afilI(Wit=w)I(z\u03bc1i=b)\u2211w\u2032=0\u221e\u2211i=1mI\u00afilI(Wit=w\u2032)I(z\u03bc1i=b)},w=0,1,2,\u2026 where I(Wit=w) is an indicator which returns 1 when Wit=w for patient i at time t in group l and 0 otherwise, I(z\u03bc1i=b) indicates the treatment group b of patient i,I\u02c6il is the posterior mean of the group membership indicator and \u03c8b is the weight associated with the placebo (b=0) or progabide group (b=1). On the other hand, the fitted pmf f\u02c6tl(w) is simply obtained by the numerical approximation described in (5) based on the parameter estimates \u03b8l and is weighted by \u03c8b. Based on Fig. 5(a)\u2013(d), both models imitate the observed pmfs pretty well. However the estimated trend in the ratio function cannot accommodate the upsurge in observation w=4 at t=2 resulting in a discrepancy between the observed and fitted pmfs in Fig. 5(b). It is not surprised to find that the two RMPGP models give similar pmfs as both have the capability of modelling highly overdispersed data.

Ignoring the outlying effects may also lead to overestimated mean and variance resulting in invalid interpretation and prediction.
