            "text": "The rudimentary mammary tissue undergoes several developmental changes during morphogenesis and lactogenesis: In the 4-mm human embryo, the breast tissue appears as a tiny mammary band on the chest wall2,\n3; by the 7-mm embryonic stage, the mammary band develops into the mammary line, along which eventually develops the true mammary anlage; by the 12-mm stage, a primitive epithelial nodule develops; by the 30-mm stage, the primitive mammary bud appears. These initial phases of development take place in both genders (Table 5\u20131). Further development in the male, however, appears to be limited by androgenic or other male-associated substances.4,\n5 Castration in male rat embryos early in gestation leads to female breast development, whereas ovariectomy in the female does not alter the course of development of the mammary anlage. Toward the end of pregnancy, initial phases of fetal mammary differentiation seem to occur under the influence of placental and transplacentally acquired maternal hormones, with transient development of the excretory and lactiferous ductular systems. Such growth, differentiation, and secretory activities are transient and regress soon after birth.5,\n6\n",

For example, lactation in goats can be induced by milking maneuvers. Adoptive breast-feeding also is well documented in primitive human societies. Sudden and permanent cessation of suckling can result in the termination of milk secretion and involution of the breast to the prepregnant state as the concentrations of prolactin decline. Estrogen and progesterone also may amplify the direct effects of prolactin or may induce additional receptors for this peptide hormone on appropriate target tissues in the breast.\n",

Increased estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy stimulate secretion of prolactin from the pituitary, whereas placental lactogen appears to inhibit the release of a prolactin-inhibiting factor from the hypothalamus. Prolactin, lactogen, estrogen, and progesterone all aid in preparing the mammary gland for lactation. Initially in gestation, an increased growth of ductule and alveolobular tissue occurs in response to estrogen and progesterone. In the beginning of the second trimester, secretory material begins to appear in the luminal cells. By the middle of the second trimester, mammary development has proceeded sufficiently to permit lactation to occur should parturition take place.",

Loss of placental hormone secretion results in an endocrine hypothalamic stimulation of prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland, as well as neural stimulation of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. The stimulation of the nipple by suckling activates a neural pathway that results in release of both prolactin and oxytocin. Prolactin is responsible for stimulating milk production, whereas oxytocin stimulates milk ejection (the combination is known as the let-down reflex). Oxytocin also stimulates uterine contractions, which the mother may feel while she is breast-feeding; this response helps to restore the uterus to prepregnancy tone.",

Synthesis of IgA appeared to be slightly increased in the parous women. IgA was found in the mammary tissues during the proliferative stage of the menstrual cycle in the nulliparous women and during the luteal phase in the parous women. The number of IgA-producing cells in the nonlactating breast was observed to increase with parity. These findings suggest that the immunologic makeup of the nonlactating, as well as the lactating, breast may be significantly influenced by the hormonal milieu. In another study of virgin mice given exogenously administered hormones,92 an extended exposure to estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin was necessary for maximal increments in IgA-producing plasma cells in the breast. Similarly, castrated males exposed to these hormones became moderately receptive to mammary gland homing of cells specific for IgA synthesis. As would be expected, testosterone eliminated female breast receptivity to these cells. These studies suggest the existence of a hormonally determined homing mechanism in the mammary gland for class-specific, immunoglobulin-producing cells.",

In limited observations, combinations of prolactin with estrogen and progesterone (in concentrations observed normally at the beginning of parturition) appeared to have an amplifying effect on the synthesis and secretion of IgA from peripheral blood lymphocytes.93 This observation raises the possibility that the high levels of sIgA observed in colostrum and milk may be the result of selective, hormonally mediated proliferation of antigen-sensitized IgA cells in the peripheral blood. The immunoglobulin could acquire secretory component during its passage through the mammary epithelium and eventually appear in the colostrum or milk as mature sIgA. Although the appearance of sIga antibody in milk characteristically follows antigenic exposure in the GALT or BALT, the precise nature of the IgA content in milk appears to be determined by a variety of other factors operating in the mucosal lymphoid tissue. These include the regulatory T cell network in the GALT and possibly in the BALT,94 the nature of antigens (soluble proteins versus particulate microbial agents),95 and the route of primary versus secondary antigenic exposure.96\n",

Infants fed human milk have demonstrated the presence of all immunoglobulin classes in the feces. Fecal IgA content was three to four times greater than that of IgM after human milk feeding.

Precoating of V. cholerae with specific sIgA protects infant mice from disease.104 Similar results have been obtained by using specific purified milk sIgA in preventing E. coli\u2013 and Shigella dysenteriae\u2013induced disease in rabbits.105 Less definite, but suggestive, is a study conducted with human milk feeding relative to the intestinal implantation of orally administered live poliovirus vaccine.106 This study found that breast-feeding may reduce the degree of seroconversion for poliovirus antibody in the vaccinated infants. Because antipolio IgA is present in human milk and colostrum, the investigators concluded that specific IgA may bind poliovirus and influence viral replication in the intestinal mucosa. Extensive experience with oral polio immunization worldwide, however, has not found an association between breast-feeding and live vaccine failures. Other studies have clearly shown that the magnitude of poliovirus replication in the intestine is determined by the presence and level of preexisting sIgA antibody. With high levels of intestinal IgA antibody, little or no replication of vaccine virus was observed in the gut. With lower levels, varying degrees of viral replication could be demonstrated.107\n",

Although several investigators have been unable to show in vitro antibody synthesis by milk lymphocytes, studies performed with colostral B cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus have shown production of IgG, as well as J-chain\u2013containing IgM and IgA.141 A small population of CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells also can be identified in most milk samples but cannot be accurately quantitated.126 In functional studies, however, colostral cells exhibit NK cytotoxicity, which is enhanced by interferon and IL-2. Colostral cells also elicit antibody- and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxic responses. The NK, as well as the antibody- and lectin-dependent, responses in colostral cells, however, have been observed to be significantly lower than those of autologous peripheral blood cells. Reduced cellular cytotoxicity of colostral cells also has been observed against virus-infected targets and certain bacteria. In fact, with several specific virus-infected targets, colostrum and milk cells conspicuously lack cellular cytotoxicity when compared with autologous peripheral blood cells.

Macrophage\u2013T cell interactions also have been postulated as being responsible for this relative hyporesponsiveness,84 although it is not known whether the effects are the result of decreased helper or increased suppressor function. Recent studies have shown that milk lymphocytes exhibit reduced responses to allogeneic cells but display good ability to stimulate alloreactivity.142 Treatment of milk lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies cytotoxic for T lymphocytes or with anti-HLA class II antigen\u2013specific monoclonal antibodies has resulted in a substantial reduction in in vitro proliferative responses to bacterial antigens. It appears that, in general, the T cell proliferative responses to PHA and tetanus toxoid in breast-fed infants are significantly higher than those in bottle-fed infants, possibly secondary to the presence of maternally derived cell growth factors and other lymphokines present in human milk.140,\n145\n",

The function of these memory T cells in the recipient human infant is currently unknown, however. Mucous membrane sites in the alimentary or respiratory tract, or both, of the recipient infant would seem to be potential entry sites for human milk leukocytes. Of considerable interest, very small numbers of memory T cells are detected in blood in infancy.149 Thus, it is possible that maternal memory T cells in milk compensate for the developmental delay in their production in the infant. In this regard, the proportion of T lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor-\u03b3\u03b4 (TCR-\u03b3\u03b4) is approximately two times greater in colostrum than in blood.150,\n151 Human TCR-\u03b3\u03b4+ cells populate organized lymphoid tissues and represent half of the intraepithelial lymphocytes in the gut.152 Thus, the intestinal epithelia may have a selective affinity for TCR-\u03b3\u03b4+ cells and provide a favorable environment for maternal T cells in milk to be transferred to the breast-fed infant. Evidence from experimental animal studies indicates that milk lymphocytes enter tissues of the neonate,153,\n154,\n155,\n156 but this has not been demonstrated in humans. In addition, the possible transfer of histocompatibility antigens and T cells to the neonate through breast-feeding has been examined by determining the fate of skin grafts in suckling rats fed by allogeneic mothers.157 Such foster feeding of milk may result not only in increased allogeneic graft survival but also in development of \u201crunting\u201d syndrome, possibly as a result of a graft-versus-host\u2013type reaction in the breast-fed animal. Effects of the transfer may be related to dosage of ingested allogeneic cells, in that increasing cell numbers transferred may prolong skin graft survival but may also increase the likelihood of a graft-versus-host reaction. Of note, the suckling rat gut has a higher degree of permeability to whole proteins than that characteristic of the human intestine. Furthermore, clinical experience in immunodeficient neonates has never supported the development of graft-versus-host reaction\u2013like disease in the breast-fed human infant. In humans, possible transfer of maternal T cell reactivity to tuberculin protein from the mother to the neonate through the process of breast-feeding has been observed.99,\n158,\n159 The implications of these observations are that maternal cellular products or soluble mediators of cellular reactivity may be transferred passively to the neonate through breast-feeding. Admittedly, however, the occurrence of such phenomena in humans has not been studied carefully. Thus, it must be emphasized that at present, evidence to suggest any T cell\u2013mediated immunologic risks associated with breast-feeding in humans is lacking. On the other hand, it is still unknown whether milk T cells, either TCR-\u03b1\u03b2+ or TCR-\u03b3\u03b4+, play a role in the transfer of adoptive immunoprotection to the recipient infant.",

Unfortunately, the specific functional role, collectively or individually, for the epithelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils, or lymphocytes in the mammary gland or the milk remains to be defined. In view of the high degree of selectivity and the differences in the quantitative and functional distribution of cellular elements, it is suggested that the mammary gland, like mucosal surfaces, may function somewhat partitioned from the cellular elements in peripheral blood, in a manner similar to that for other peripheral sites (such as the genital tract) of the common mucosal system. It is, however, not known whether the characteristic proportions of macrophages, T lymphocytes, other cytotoxic cells, or epithelial cells are designed for any specific functions localized to the mammary gland in the lactating mother or to epithelium or lumen of the intestinal or respiratory mucosa of the breast-feeding infant, or both. The observations on the transfer of delayed hypersensitivity reactions in human neonates and of graft-versus-host reactivity in the rat raise the possibility that milk cells may function as important vehicles in transfer of maternal immunity to neonates. The potential beneficial and harmful roles of such cell-mediated transfer through the mucosal routes, however, need to be investigated further. The paucity of NK and other cytotoxic cells in the colostrum may have a role for the breast-feeding neonate, especially in influencing the antigen processing and uptake of replicating microorganisms and their immune response at systemic or mucosal levels or both. Although colostral cells await further elucidation of their function in the mammary glands and the suckling neonate, it is likely that their presence in the milk represents a highly selective phenomenon and not a mere contamination with peripheral blood cells.",

(2) They are adapted to resist digestion in the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient infant. (3) They protect by noninflammatory mechanisms. (4) They act synergistically with each other or with factors produced by the infant. (5) Most components of the immune system in human milk are produced throughout lactation and during gradual weaning, but (6) there is often an inverse relationship between the production of these factors in the mammary gland and their production by the infant during the same time frames of lactation and postnatal development. Indeed, as lactation proceeds, the concentration of many factors in human milk declines. Concomitantly, the mucosal production of these factors rises in the developing infant. It is unclear whether the inverse relationship between these processes is due to feedback mechanisms or whether the processes are independent.",

Although the quantities of total gangliosides in human and in bovine milk are similar, the relative frequencies of each type of ganglioside in milk from these two species are distinct. More than 50 types of monosialylated oligosaccharides have been identified in human milk, and new types are still being recognized.182 Monosialoganglioside 3 constitutes about 74% of total gangliosides in human milk, but the percentage is much lower in bovine milk.183,\n184 Also, the level of the enterotoxin receptor ganglioside GM1 is 10 times greater in human than in bovine milk.184 This difference may be of clinical importance because GM1 inhibits enterotoxins of E. coli and V. cholerae.185 It also is of interest that intact human milk fat globules, as well as the mucin from the membranes of these structures, inhibit the binding of S-fimbriated E. coli to human buccal epithelial cells.186\n",

Its bioactive properties were confirmed by the finding that human milk samples inhibited blood lymphocyte proliferation and that this property was greatly reduced by treatment with anti-IL-10 antibody. Of interest, mice with a targeted disruption in the IL-10 gene, when raised under conventional housing conditions, spontaneously develop a generalized enterocolitis that becomes apparent at the age of 4 to 8 weeks (time of weaning).259 These observations suggest that IL-10 in human milk may play a critical role in the homeostasis of the immature intestinal barrier by regulating aberrant immune responses to foreign antigens. Soluble receptors and cytokine receptor antagonists also are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Human colostrum and mature milk have been shown to contain biologically active levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptors I and II (sTNF-\u03b1RI and sTNF-\u03b1RII).260 The in vivo relevance of these observations also has been confirmed in a chemically induced colitis model of rats. Animals with colitis fed human milk had significantly lower neutrophilic inflammation than animals fed either chow or infant formula.261 Similar \u201cprotective\u201d effects were seen in rats with colitis fed an infant formula supplemented with IL-1Ra,261 suggesting that this anti-inflammatory agent present in milk may contribute to the broad protection against different injuries provided by human milk feeding.",

            "text": "In the 1990s, several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that mediate the effector phases of natural and specific immunity were discovered in human milk. These include IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-8, growth-related peptide-\u03b1 (GRO-\u03b1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and TGF-\u03b2 (Table 5\u20138). Human milk displays a number of cytokine-characteristic biologic activities, including the stimulation of growth, differentiation of immunoglobulin production by B cells,288,\n289,\n290 enhancement of thymocyte proliferation,291 inhibition of IL-2 production by T cells,292 and suppression of IgE production.267 IL-1\u03b2293 and TNF-\u03b1 294 were the first two cytokines quantified in human milk. In colostrum, TNF-\u03b1 is present mainly in fractions of molecular weight between 80 and 195 kDa, probably bound to its soluble receptors.260 Milk TNF-\u03b1 is secreted both by milk macrophages294,\n295 and by the mammary epithelium.296 IL-6 was first demonstrated in human milk by a specific bioassay.297 In this study, anti-IL-6\u2013neutralizing antibodies inhibited IgA production by colostrum mononuclear cells, suggesting that IL-6 may be involved in the production of IgA in the mammary gland. The presence of IL-6 in milk also has been demonstrated by immunoassays.294,\n296,\n298,\n299 In like manner, IL-6 is localized in high-molecular-weight fractions of human milk.298 The association of IL-6 with its own receptor has not been studied in milk, although the expression of IL-6 receptor by the mammary epithelium296 and in secreted form in the milk260 may explain the high molecular weight of this cytokine in human milk. The expression of IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein in milk cells and in the mammary gland epithelium suggests that both milk mononuclear cells and the mammary gland are likely major sources of this cytokine.295,\n296,\n300 The presence of IFN-\u03b3 in human milk also has been reported,151,\n296,\n299 although some investigators have found significant levels of IFN-\u03b3 only in milk samples obtained from mothers whose infants had been delivered by cesarean section. The significance of this observation is not clear at present. IFN-\u03b3 bioactivity as well as its association with specific subsets of milk T cells also remains to be determined.151(The presence and possible function of IL-10 in human milk are discussed in the section \u201cAnti-inflammatory Agents.\u201d)\n",

IL-8 and GRO-\u03b1 belong to the CXC family and are mainly chemotactic factors for neutrophils. On the other hand, CC chemokines, which include MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), are chemotactic factors for monocytes, basophils and eosinophils, and T lymphocytes.302 The presence of both CXC and CC chemokines has been described in human milk (see Table 5\u20138). IL-8 concentration was first determined in a small group of milk samples by Basolo and colleagues.296 These investigators identified the expression and secretion of IL-8 by mammary epithelial cells, although milk cells also appear to produce this chemokine.295,\n300 Another member of the CXC chemokine found in human milk is GRO-\u03b1, along with the two CC chemokines MCP-1 and RANTES.300 Expression of MCP-1 and, to a lesser extent, RANTES mRNA was confirmed in studies of milk cells.300 Recently, high levels of the CC chemokine eotaxin, a potent and specific chemotactic factor for eosinophils and subtype 2 helper T cells (TH2), also have been demonstrated in human milk.303\n",

Secretory IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in preterm as well as in term milk, although the sIgA concentration appears to be significantly higher in preterm milk collected during the first 8 to 12 weeks of lactation. Secretory IgA antibody activity against certain organisms (E. coli somatic antigen) in the preterm milk was observed to be somewhat less than, or at best similar to, that found in term milk. In addition, the number of lymphocytes and macrophages in milk appears to be lower at 2 weeks but significantly higher at 12 weeks in milk from mothers with preterm (born at 34 to 38 weeks of gestational age) infants than in milk from those with full-term infants.311 The authors of these investigations have proposed that some of the observed changes may reflect the lower volume of milk produced by mothers delivered of preterm infants. The possibility remains that changes in the immunologic profile of preterm milk may be a consequence of inadequate stimulation by the preterm infant, alterations in the maternal hormonal milieu, or other factors underlying premature delivery itself.",

The former represents an anatomic and enzymatic blockage to invasion of microorganisms and antigens, and the latter, an inhibition of colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Although permeability of the neonatal gut to immunoglobulin is rather short-lived or incompletely developed, unprotected or damaged neonatal gut is permeable to a host of other proteins and macromolecules for several weeks or longer. Large milk protein peptides and bovine serum albumin have been shown to enter the circulation and produce a circulating antibody response. The inflamed or ischemic gut is even more porous to both antigens and pathogens. A variety of proven and presumed mechanisms for the role of both IgA and the normal flora have been proposed to compensate for these temporary inadequacies. Evidence for gut-trophic substances in humans is still preliminary. Ample epidemiologic evidence exists for a positive effect of breast-feeding in establishing the normal gut flora. Most compelling are the observations in rural Guatemala of gross contamination of milk by potentially pathogenic aerobic, gram-negative bacilli, including E. coli and Shigella species, with an absence both of diarrheal illness and of significant numbers of these organisms in the feces of infants during the period of lactation. In addition, the diverse serotypes of aerobic, gram-negative bacilli present in the oropharynx and the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate may serve as a source of antigen to boost the presensitized mammary glands, leading to a further modulation of specific bacterial growth in the mucosa.313 The precise role of antibody that blocks adherence of these pathogens to the gut and the effects of other factors, such as lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, in those situations are undetermined.",

Conflicting data exist regarding prevention of human rotaviral infection and disease. Evaluation of nursery outbreaks of rotaviral disease has suggested that the incidence both of infection and of illness was lower in breast-fed infants, but the incidence of symptoms in formula-fed infants also was very low. Studies carried out in Japan have noted a fivefold decrease in incidence of rotaviral infection among breast-fed infants younger than 6 months of age. It must be emphasized that most rotavirus infections in neonates are asymptomatic, regardless of breast- or bottle-feeding.317,\n318,\n319,\n320,\n321 On the basis of careful clinical observations, Bishop and co-workers322 in Australia first questioned the positive effects of breast-feeding in rotavirus infection. More recent case-control studies of enteric viral infections in breast-fed infants have suggested that breast-feeding may protect infants from hospitalization rather than from infection itself.323,\n324 Longitudinal follow-up of a large cohort of infants during a community outbreak of rotavirus has shown that attack rates of rotavirus infection were similar in breast-fed and in bottle-fed infants. The frequency of clinical disease with diarrhea, however, appeared to be significantly lower in breast-fed infants. Of interest, the protection observed in these patients was more a reflection of altered microbial flora from breast-feeding than of specific immunologic protection against rotavirus. Thus, it appears that breast-feeding provides significant protection against diarrheal disease, although the mechanism of such protection remains to be defined.323,\n324\n",

Beneficial results of breast-feeding as prophylaxis against atopy have been observed in most of the studies; in others, however, beneficial effects were reported only in infants with a genetically determined risk for atopic disease. Finally, no beneficial effect at all or even an increased risk has been suggested in some breast-fed infants. Kramer, in an extensive meta-analysis of 50 studies published before 1986 that focused on infant feeding and atopic disease, has attempted to shed some light on the controversy.344 Seven of the 13 studies on asthma included in this analysis claimed a protective effect of breast-feeding, whereas 6 claimed no protection. Several serious methodologic drawbacks, however, have been noted in this analysis. In a number of the studies analyzed, early infant feeding history was obtained months or years after the feeding period, ascertainment of the infant feeding history was obtained by interviewers who were aware of the disease outcome, or insufficient duration and exclusivity of breast-feeding were documented; all were confounding variables that considered inappropriate \u201cexposure standards.\u201d Nonblind ascertainment of disease outcome was found to be the most common violation of the \u201coutcome standards.\u201d",

Factors that seem to have the greatest potential for confounding effects include the family history of atopic disease, socioeconomic status, and parental cigarette smoking. Only 1 of 13 studies on asthma included in the meta-analysis adequately controlled for these confounding factors. Moreover, 3 of the studies that did not demonstrate a protective effect of breast-feeding on asthma had inadequate statistical power.

The first study269 consisted of prospective, long-term evaluation from infancy until the age of 17 years; the prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in those infants with short-duration (less than 1 month) or no breast-feeding, which increased to a demonstrable difference by the age of 17 years, than in the infants with intermediate-duration (1 to 6 months) or prolonged (longer than 6 months) breast-feeding. The differences in the prevalence of atopy persisted when the groups were divided according to positive or negative atopic heredity. Furthermore, the atopy manifestations in the different infant feeding groups did not remain constant with age. In particular, respiratory allergy, including asthma, increased greatly in prevalence up to the age of 17 years, with a prevalence as high as 64% in the group with short-duration or no breast-feeding.269 In the second study, a prospective, longitudinal study of the prevalence and risk factors for acute and chronic respiratory illness in childhood, the investigators examined the relationship of infant feeding to recurrent wheezing at age 6 years and the association with lower respiratory tract illnesses associated with wheezing early in life.345 Children who were never breast-fed had significantly higher rates of recurrent wheezing at 6 years of age. Increasing duration of breast-feeding beyond 1 month was not associated with significantly lower rates of recurrent wheezing. The effect of breast-feeding was apparent for children both with and without wheezing lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first 6 months of life. In contrast with the findings of the first study, however, the effect of breast-feeding was significant only among nonatopic children.345\n",

            "text": "The exact mechanisms by which breast-feeding seems to confer long-lasting protection against allergic sensitization are poorly understood. It is likely, however, that multiple synergistic mechanisms may be responsible for this effect, including (1) maturation of the recipient gastrointestinal and airway mucosa, promoted by growth factors present in human milk242,\n243,\n244; (2) inhibition of antigen absorption by milk sIgA346; (3) reduced incidence of mucosal infections and consequent sensitization to bystander antigens347; (4) changes in the microbial flora of the intestine of breast-fed infants325; and (5) direct immunomodulatory activity of human milk components on the recipient infant.241 A number of earlier and more recent studies have greatly contributed to the understanding of macromolecular transport across the immature gut and its consequences in terms of the generation of circulating antibody or immune complexes, the processes that are blocked predominantly by sIgA, the glycocalyx, and the intestinal enzymes. These mucosal immunologic events have been the basis for the concept of immune exclusion. Immune exclusion is not absolute, however, because uptake of some antigens across the gut may be enhanced rather than blocked by interaction with antibody at the mucosal surface. Beginning with the observations of IgA-deficient patients, it has become clear that the absence of the IgA barrier in the gut is associated with both an increased incidence of circulating antibodies directed against many food antigens and an increased occurrence of atopic-allergic diseases.346 Some studies have noted complement activation in serum after feeding of bovine milk to children with cow\u2019s milk allergy. The neonate is similar in some respects to the IgA-deficient patient,348 and increased transintestinal uptake of food antigen with consequent circulating antibody formation in the premature infant has been reported.349 Other studies have suggested that early breast-feeding, even of short duration, is associated with a decreased serum antibody response to cow\u2019s milk proteins.253 Prolonged breast-feeding not only may partially exclude foreign antigens through immune exclusion but may also, because the mother\u2019s milk is the infant\u2019s sole food, prevent their ingestion.350 It must, however, be emphasized that intact bovine milk proteins and other food antigens and antibodies have been observed in samples of colostrum and milk.6\n",

The neonatal ferret gut, however, is quite permeable to macromolecules and permits passage of large quantities of virus-specific IgG. In the absence of either documented antibody or cellular transfer in the human neonate across the mucosa, any mechanisms of protection against respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory pathogens remain obscure.",

The possibility of postnatal transmission of this virus from mother to child has been considered in a large number of infants breast-fed in the United States and in other parts of the world. In some of these infants, breast-feeding has been implicated as one of the major risk factors for acquisition of HIV infection. Since 1985, small but significant numbers of infants with HIV infection possibly acquired through the process of breast-feeding have been reported.376 In virtually all reported cases, maternal seroconversion for HIV antibody probably occurred after delivery of the infant. More than 50% of these mothers acquired the infection through heterosexual transmission, and about 30% through blood transfusion. Few of the mothers were judged to be intravenous drug users. Although acquisition of HIV infection before delivery cannot be ruled out with certainty, the likely route of transmission in these infants has been presumed to be through breast-feeding. The most convincing observations are based on several maternal-infant pairs in whom maternal seroconversion to HIV antibody occurred 4 months or longer after delivery.377\n",

Limited epidemiologic studies carried out to date, however, have failed to demonstrate the magnitude of risk of HIV infection in breast-fed infants. Cohort studies383 in different populations have suggested increased, reduced, or similar transmission rates in breast-feeding and in non\u2013breast-feeding (bottle-feeding) infants of seropositive mothers (Table 5\u201311). Thus, it appears that although precise epidemiologic data are still lacking, a majority of breast-fed infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers remain uninfected despite the presence of HIV DNA in the milk in a high proportion of such mothers. Nevertheless, the risk of acquisition of HIV infection through breast-feeding must not be ignored. On the basis of meta-analysis of available data, it has been estimated that the additional risk of HIV infection through breast-feeding may be as high as 22%.384 Some studies have suggested that breast-feeding contributes up to a 50% increase in the overall vertical transmission of HIV infection.385\n",

Associated maternal factors include younger age, multiple deliveries, high virus load, lower number of CD4+ lymphocytes, and maternal mastitis. Other risk factors associated with the maternal milk include high viral load in the milk, long duration of breast-feeding, especially mixed formula feeding and breast-feeding, low levels of antiviral factor in the milk (low CTL, sIgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme). Evidence of oral candidiasis in the breast-feeding neonate also appears to be a risk factor for development of breast-feeding\u2013associated HIV infection.1\n",

Many states, however, now depend on formula manufacturer rebates to fund part of their WIC programs, creating something of a conflict of interest.

During the past 150 to 300 years, however, the human societal culture has undergone remarkable changes in rapid succession, which have had a major impact on the basic mechanisms of maternal-neonatal interaction and breast-feeding. Such changes include introduction of sanitation and nonhuman milk and formula feeds for neonatal nutrition, use of antimicrobial agents, introduction of processed foods, and exposure to newer environmental macromolecules and dietary antigens. The introduction of such manmade changes in the neonatal environment has had a profound impact on human homeostatic mechanisms and at the same time allowed new insights into the role of breast-feeding in the developing human neonate.",

Newer evidence suggests a protective role of breast-feeding in modulating many respiratory, intestinal, and urinary tract infections, otitis media, and NEC in the neonate. This information has been recently reviewed by Hanson in an elegant monograph.415 Despite the overwhelmingly protective role attributed to natural breast-feeding and the evolutionary advantages related to the development of lactation, several infectious agents have acquired, during the course of evolution, the ability to evade immunologic factors in milk and to use milk as the vehicle for maternal-to-infant transmission. The potential for the acquisition of infections such as those due to HIV, HTLV, CMV, and possibly other pathogens highlights potential hazards of breast-feeding in some clinical situations.",
