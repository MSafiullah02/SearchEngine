WHO also requested that all countries immediately activate their preparedness plans and be on high alert for an unusual outbreak of an influenza-like illness and severe In response to COVID-19, China invested an unprecedented amount of resources in epidemic control in economic, socio-cultural, and personnel terms. Across the country, all economic activity and celebrations for the lunar new year were halted for more than four weeks starting in late January. The first city on complete lockdown was Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicentre, on January 23, followed by at least 48 cities and four provinces, affecting approximately 500 million people -6.3% of the world\"s population, and more than the entire population of the United States or European Union. To contain the epidemic, China imposed travel restrictions on its own residents, denying travel visas to those wanting to leave, and 3 stopping all overseas toursa self-imposed control measure intended to prevent the virus from spreading abroad.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Though the virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be highly contagious, as of February 24, the epidemic had been largely contained within Hubei province. In addition to Hubei, only 4 out of 32 provincial-level administrative divisions in mainland China had a cumulative confirmed case count over 1,000, ranging from 1,016 (Hunan) to 1,342 (Guangdong); 2 all had laboratory-confirmed deaths of fewer than 20. 2 Within Hubei province, cases and deaths have been mostly concentrated in Wuhan and a handful of neighbouring cities (Figure 1 ). 2 These epidemic control efforts bought life-saving time for the rest of the country and the international community, allowing for more research on COVID-19 for treatment strategies, development and production of diagnostic testing and vaccines, as well as local planning for epidemic preparedness and response. Table 1 presents the estimated case fatality rates (CFR) based on confirmed deaths over cases. 2 The numbers highlighted the tremendous stress on the physical and psychosocial health of the front line workers. Furthermore, the call of duty as care provider, guilt for not putting loved ones first, the risking of their own health and lives, and even mistreatment by their own community as potential disease carriers all added to the burden of their choice to fight this fight on the front lines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 943, "end": 944, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 523, "end": 532, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 848, "end": 855, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although it is impossible to ascertain the precise CFR for COVID-19 at this point in time, it has already become clear that the CFR is far lower than that of previous coronavirus outbreaks like SARS (10%) 3 or MERS (34.4%) 4 , and public communication and media reporting should provide factual communication on epidemiological data available and be cautious in distinguishing \"real risks\" vs \"perceived risks\" in their messaging.

The difference in fatality rates 4 between Hubei vs non-Hubei provinces (3.7% and 0.8%, respectively) may be attributed to both clinical and non-clinical factors during a large-scale public health emergency such as a lack of information regarding the health threat during early days of response, failure of the early warning and mitigation systems, compromised standard of care, exceeded surge capacity, and limited access to care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 224, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 627, "end": 628, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "An outbreak can happen anytime, anywhere, and can affect anyone. Unfortunately, the largest epidemic control effort ever put forth to contain one single epidemic in human history has been met with negativity from the international community, with the onset of strict travel restrictions, mass evacuations, and widespread flight cancellations in early February, despite WHO advising against them. This response was disproportionate to what was seen even at the highest level of global alert during the A(H1N1) pandemic. Before COVID-19 spread beyond mainland China, hostility had already emerged in lands far away from the epicentre with lamentable instances of fearmongering, racism in the media, misleading rumours and conspiracy theories, and discrimination and violence against Chinese/East Asian expat communities. Stigmatization and discrimination during epidemics have been welldocumented and consistently correlated with racism and xenophobia, often spread through the media. 5, 6 When diseases are thought to be deadly, some cope with their fears by blaming new outbreaks on individuals or groups outside of their own social circle. Often, people whose national, ethnic, or religious backgrounds are different from those of the \"mainstream\" group/media are accused of spreading the disease, exacerbating already existing racial and political tensions -for example, Chinese people in the current outbreak and Africans during the Ebola epidemic. 8 In Asia, several media outlets have opted to use \"Wuhan-pneumonia\" 7 instead of COVID-19 in their reporting even though WHO has explicitly advised against naming new human infectious diseases with geographic locations or populations since 2015.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 983, "end": 985, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 986, "end": 987, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1453, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "By employing framing strategy to \"other\" a subgroup in society, the media draws attention to certain aspects of the issue and alienates one sub-community from the rest of the population as the leading culpable factor for an outbreak.
