Genomic diversity resulted in proteome diversity, with one-third to half of proteins variable among ASFV proteomes. Besides, nearly 20% of proteins had replications in adjacent positions. Further analysis identified extensive homologous recombination in the ASFV genomes, which is consistent with the occurrence of indels. Repeated elements of 15~50 bp were widely distributed in ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination. Moreover, two homologous recombination-related enzymes, the recombinase and DNA topoisomerase, were found to keep conserved in all ASFVs analyzed here.",

It is classified as the only member of the family Asfarviridae 1 2 . The genome of the virus belong to double-stranded DNA, the size of which range from 170 kb to 190 kb 3 . ASFV mainly infect suids, which include domestic pigs and wild boars, and soft ticks. The former was reported to be natural host for the virus 4, 5 . ASFV was firstly discovered in Kenya in 1921 6 . It remained restricted to Africa until 1957 when it was reported in Portugal. Until now, the virus has caused outbreaks in more than fifty countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and South America 5 . The latest reports show that the virus caused outbreaks in more than ten provinces in China 7, 8 . Because of high lethality caused ASFV in domestic pigs, massive culling campaigns and pig movement restrictions are the most commonly used strategies for control of the virus, which often cause huge loss on pig production and people's livelihoods 4 . Unfortunately, no vaccine or treatment against ASFV is available in the current. Development of more effective method for control of the virus is challenging.",

They should reflect the genetic diversity of ASFVs to a large extent. Secondly, the location and size of indels observed in ASFV genomes are affected by alignment algorithms. To remove this bias, we have used two different kinds of commonly used methods for generating alignment of ASFV genomes. In both cases, frequent indels were observed and found to play a more important role than genomic mutations. Thirdly, the proteome of each ASFV was inferred by computation methods.

Discussion This work systematically analyzed the genetic diversity of ASFVs. The large genome enable the virus encode an abundance of proteins. The functions of the virus in its life circle could be accomplished by multiple proteins. For example, 38, 5, and 4 protein groups were respectively involved in DNA replication and transcription, antigen and evasion of host immunity. The numbers are very likely to be under-estimated since 40% of proteins had unknown functions. This may facilitate efficient control of host cell and precise regulation of viral activities. Large differences were observed between the proteomes of ASFVs due to two reasons. On one hand, one-third to one-half of proteins of each ASFV are variable among ASFVs. On the other hand, there were lots of gene replications (or paralogs) in ASFV genomes. Diverse proteome among viruses may lead to diverse phenotype, such as antigen and virulence.",

            "text": "Although lots of efforts have been devoted to develop vaccines against the ASFV, unfortunately, all of them have been unsuccessful. The failure could be attributed to many factors, such as the absence of neutralizing antibodies, diverse antigen-related proteins, complexity of neutralization, and so on. This work found that besides the core proteins p54 and p72, three other antigen-related proteins (pEP153R, pCP204L and pEP402R) were variable among ASFVs. Besides, a total of 62 membrane proteins were identified, half of which had unknown functions. They are very likely to be antigen-related. More efforts are needed to determine their role in stimulating neutralizing antibodies, and the neutralization mechanisms and efficiency. Previous studies showed that immunized pigs with the baculovirus expressed hemagglutinin of ASFV were protected against the viral lethal infection. This suggests that incorporation of more antigen proteins in the vaccine may provide better protection.Indels were found to contribute much larger to the genetic diversity of ASFVs than genomic mutations did. Compared to genomic mutations, indels could introduce large variation to the genome, and cause a great damage to the genome structures, which may lead to death of the individual organisms. Therefore, few indels were observed for viruses with small genome, such as influenza viruses and HBV. However, for viruses with large genomes, such as ASFV, they are more robust to indels since they have lots of repeated elements and proteins (paralogs).Moreover, indels may provide a more efficient way of survival than genomic mutations under the natural selection pressure, since the virus could rapidly change its phenotype, such as antigen, virulence, or ability of replication and transcription. For example, deletion of some MGF genes could reduce viral replication or virulence, which may help viral infection of soft ticks3,38 .",
