Viverrids are commonly exploited for human consumption, being farmed and hunted for their fur, meat, \u2018civet\u2019 scent, to produce civet coffee, or to be kept as zoo animals or pets (Schreiber et al., 1989; Balakrishnan and Sreedevi, 2007; Shepherd and Shepherd, 2010; D'Cruze et al., 2014). While habitat loss has contributed to historical population declines, hunting for human consumption is considered the most significant threat to their global conservation (Schreiber et al., 1989; Shepherd and Shepherd, 2010).",

Given the potential for transmission of diseases between wildlife, humans and livestock (Jones et al., 2008), a complete list of pathogens and indigenous microflora also enables evidence\u2010based risk assessment of human and animal contact with the species in question (Travis et al., 2006).",

In doing so, it expands on our understanding of viverrid health and the key epidemiological factors of infectious disease involving free living and captive wildlife. More importantly, this review assesses the significance of isolation of organisms from viverrids in terms of the implications for public health. Anthropogenic factors including wildlife trade, the keeping of viverrids in captivity and land use change all encourage increased contact between viverrids and other species, thereby facilitating the transmission and spillover of these organisms between humans, viverrids and other animals.",

It is undoubtedly incomplete as many more reports are likely to exist in the medical records of zoos and rescue centres that hold viverrids, unavailable to a database literature review. Inaccuracies are also likely included due to the reliance on traditional approaches to identification, such as descriptions of morphology (Nadler and De Leon, 2011). Increased availability of molecular methods has significantly improved accuracy in the detection and identification of organisms (Bhadury et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009), resulting in a revision of numerous taxonomic trees (Brown\u2010Elliott et al., 2006; Balajee et al., 2009).

Three important viruses of domestic carnivores were also reported, including canine distemper virus (CDV) (Machida et al., 1992; Hur et al., 1999; Chandra et al., 2000; L\u00f3pez\u2010Pe\u00f1a et al., 2001; Hirama et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Takayama et al., 2009), feline parvovirus (caused by the feline panleukopenia virus, FPV) (Ikeda et al., 1999; Demeter et al., 2009) and canine parvovirus (CP) (Santos et al., 2009; Xiao\u2010Ying et al., 2011; Duarte et al., 2013). In more recent years, the use of advanced molecular techniques has enabled the identification of five novel viruses of uncertain significance. These were an orthoreovirus (mammalian reovirus MPC/04) isolated from Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) in China (Shao et al., 2008, 2010); the ikoma lyssavirus, a novel divergent lyssavirus (Marston et al., 2012); two picornaviruses (genet faecal theilovirus (GFTV) and a kobuvirus genotype); and a picobirnavirus (genet faecal picobirnavirus) (Bodewes et al., 2014;).",

The sarcoptid mite, Notoedres cati, a common parasite of domestic and wild felids, was reported for urban\u2010dwelling Masked palm civet in Japan (Ninomiya et al., 2003). Many species of ixodid tick, most of which are themselves carriers of zoonotic pathogens, were also reported, including Amblyomma testudinarium (Grassman et al., 2004); Ixodes ovatus (Tanskul et al., 1983; Robbins et al., 1997); a number of Haemaphysalis spp. (Hoogstraal and Trapido, 1966; Hoogstraal, 1971; Tanskul et al., 1983; Tolosa and Regassa, 2007; Mediannikov et al., 2012); Rhipicephalus spp. (Grassman et al., 2004; Tolosa and Regassa, 2007); Dermacentor tawianensis (Hoogstraal et al., 1986) and D. auratus (Hoogstraal and Wassef, 1985). The chewing louse, Felicola bengalensis was collected from a wild civet (Changbunjong et al., 2011), and one internal arthropod parasite, the pentostome Armillifer moniliformis, was reported for a range of civet species (Stabler and Self, 1967; Krishnasamy et al., 1981). Identification of arthropods was based on morphology of varying life cycle stages of the organisms collected from viverrids.",

However, most reports listed here provide no information on the presence or absence of clinical signs associated with infection, as many document researches carried out on stored biological samples (Moinet et al., 2010), on samples collected at necropsy (Santos et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2013), or on samples, such as faeces, collected opportunistically without seeing the individual animal (Colon and Patton, 2013; Su et al., 2013). In other reports, including all reported nematodes in viverrids (Table 3), clinical signs were simply not discussed. In these cases, it is not possible to elucidate whether isolation of these organisms from clinically unwell Viverridae explains the presence of disease, or whether it is simply an incidental finding.",

Viverrids are understood to be infective hosts, capable of transmitting disease, for a small number of organisms. These include the SARS CoV, for which Masked palm civets were important amplification and transmission hosts in the epidemic of respiratory disease caused by the organism in southern China in 2003 (Guan et al., 2003). Viverrids also transmit the infective life cycle stage of a number of macroparasites including the Sarcoptid mite, Notoedres cati (Ninomiya et al., 2003) and helminthes Toxocara genettae (Sanmartin et al., 1992), Ancylostoma sp. (Coumaranem and Mohan, 2008), Rictularia sp. (Schmidt and Kuntz, 1967; Kumar et al., 2005), Taenia sp. (Mahannop et al., 1984; Millan and Casanova, 2007) and Diplopylidium monoophorum (Millan and Casanova, 2007). However, for many more, the significance of viverrids as hosts is probably insignificant. For example, wild Common genets are dead end hosts for Leptospira interrogans serovars (Icterohemorragiae and Ballum) (Mill\u00e1n et al., 2009); and Binturong (Arctictus binturong), Small\u2010toothed palm civet (Arctogalidia trivirgata), Masked palm civet, Common palm civet and Otter civet (Cynogale bennettii) are believed to be accidental hosts for the pentostome Armillifer moniliformis (Stabler and Self, 1967; Krishnasamy et al., 1981;). In many other cases, the opportunistic identification of organisms from a small sample size, a recognized impediment to disease surveillance in wild species (Stitt et al., 2007), hampers our ability to understand the role of Viverridae in the organism's life cycle. The amount of useful epidemiological information obtained is particularly limited where a multihost organism, such as the ixodid tick Amblyomma testudinarium, is identified from just one individual viverrid (Grassman et al., 2004). Positive results obtained through opportunistic sampling of small numbers of individuals remain useful in that they provide information on the presence of potential new carriers for an organism, but further research is required to understand the role that viverrids play in the organism's life cycle, or their significance in the epidemiology of the diseases which they cause.",

Canine distemper virus (CDV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CP) (Table 1) are all highly contagious and cause significant morbidity and mortality in susceptible carnivore species. Infected carnivores shed a high viral load in faeces and other bodily secretions (Deem et al., 2000; Steinel et al., 2001), facilitating environmental contamination and rapid spread of disease. Infection of susceptible animals does not require direct contact as transmission may be via inhalation of aerosolized respiratory secretions or ingestion of contaminated material from the environment (Deem et al., 2000; Steinel et al., 2001). Spillover of canine distemper virus from the domestic dog has already impacted several wild carnivore populations, including African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) (Fanshawe et al., 1991), Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) (Timm et al., 2009), Black\u2010footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) (Williams et al., 1988) and Lions (Panthera leo) (Roelke\u2010Parker et al., 1996), and has been implicated as a significant concern for the conservation of Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in Russia (Gilbert et al., 2014). Multihost viruses such as those listed for Viverridae may pose a threat to the conservation of threatened wild viverrids where their distribution overlaps areas inhabited by unvaccinated domestic carnivores, and must be considered in population management, preventative health measures or in case of disease outbreak. Conversely, viverrids themselves may contribute to the maintenance and cycling of pathogens in an environment which, in turn, could threaten the conservation of other endangered species.",

Wild species are a common source or carrier of zoonotic pathogens (Wolfe et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2008), and there is a growing interest in understanding the host, pathogen and external (environmental and anthropogenic) factors that facilitate their transmission from wild animals to people and other animals (Bengis et al., 2004; Woolhouse and Gowtage\u2010Sequeria, 2005; Greger, 2007; Chomel, 2008; Rhyan and Spraker, 2010). The vast majority of organisms reported here for viverrids have the capacity to infect a wide range of species a characteristic which, while common amongst pathogens in general \u2013 91% of all domestic carnivore pathogens infect more than one host (Cleaveland et al., 2001) \u2013 is of concern as it is a significant risk factor for outbreak of disease (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Greger, 2007). Given the prevalence of multihost organisms reported for viverrids, particularly those with zoonotic potential, an examination of the factors bringing these forest dwelling mammals into unnaturally close proximity with humans is warranted. For the Viverridae, these include the trades (legal and illegal) in wildlife for human consumption, keeping of viverrids in captivity (wildlife farms, zoos or rescue centres), and human contact with free\u2010ranging viverrids in areas where human and viverrid habitation overlap, or from human incursion into wild spaces.",

While the number of organisms reported for this animal source (refer to \u2018Country (source)\u2019 column, Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) is low compared to other animal sources, this is likely due to the paucity of research in this area rather than a reliable indication of the health of viverrids in the trade, or the potential significance of this source as a concern for public health.

In fact, a viverrid played a central role in the pandemic of human respiratory disease caused by one of the most significant diseases to emerge from the wildlife trade system to date \u2013 the SARS CoV (Table 1). Masked palm civets in this crowded, multispecies wet market in southern China were implicated as the main source of infection in humans via exposure to viral particles in bodily fluids aerosolized during slaughter and preparation for human consumption (Guan et al., 2003; WHO, 2004; Li, 2008; Chan et al., 2013).

Any one of the zoonotic pathogens reported for viverrids in this review may be transmitted to humans during this process, but the rabies virus, another significant viral zoonosis commonly reported for viverrids, is one for which this process is a documented transmission risk (Table 1). The broad tissue tropism of rabies (Carey and McLean, 1978) facilitates aerosolization and environmental contamination during the butchering of rabid animals, resulting in confirmed cases of transmission to people following slaughter of domestic dog and cat in China and Vietnam (Kureishi et al., 1992; Wertheim et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2011). Given the conditions in which the wildlife trade currently operates, the considerable scale of trade in viverrids and their susceptibility to such a wide range of multihost organisms, it is likely that species from this family could again play a central role in the emergence, amplification and transmission of disease to people within this system (Dong et al., 2007).",

Civets have traditionally been farmed for their fur (Shi and Hu, 2008) and to supply the demand for \u2018civet\u2019 scent (used in the production of perfume), a practice which drives farming of civets in Ethiopia (Tolosa and Regassa, 2007) and India (Balakrishnan and Sreedevi, 2007). More recently, farming of civet in Asia has expanded to supply a growing demand for their meat in wildlife restaurants and markets (Patou et al., 2009). While published data on wildlife farming are scant, the number of individual civets on farms is likely to be large \u2013 by 2003, 40,000 individual civets were registered on farms in China (Patou et al., 2009). Another growing industry is the production of civet coffee, where coffee beans are fed to civets and subsequently harvested, undigested, from their faeces. Traditionally collected from the faeces of free\u2010ranging animals in the vicinity of coffee farms, coffee producers are increasingly turning to caged production to satisfy demand for this product, which has the dubious distinction of being the \u2018world's most expensive coffee\u2019 (D'Cruze et al., 2014; Techangamsuwan et al., 2014).",

This was confirmed on PCR and serology from a number of Owston's civets (Chrotogale owstoni) which died following an outbreak of respiratory and neurological diseases in a conservation breeding programme in Vietnam (Roberton et al., 2006). While no evidence of viverrid\u2010to\u2010human transmission of HPAI H5N1 exists, isolation of pathogens with pandemic potential from any mammalian host is significant as it may provide conditions suitable for the virus to adapt to mammalian respiratory epithelial receptors, enabling efficient mammal\u2010to\u2010human, and possibly also human\u2010to\u2010human, transmission, paving the way for a potentially devastating pandemic (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2006; Peiris et al., 2007). Isolation of this virus from captive civets is also significant in that some countries with the highest number of human cases and fatalities due to HPAI H5N1, such as Indonesia, China and Vietnam (WHO, 2015), overlap with those where civets are also farmed in the greatest numbers (Patou et al., 2009; D'Cruze et al., 2014), a risk compounded by the poor standards of husbandry and lack of veterinary care reported for wildlife farms (WSPA, 1998; WCS, 2008).

For many of the organisms reported here for captive civets, including the enterobacteriaceae Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serovar Glostrup in Nigerian zoos (Falade and Durojaiye, 1976; Enurah et al., 1988b) and Escherichia coli in a Japanese zoo (Ahmed et al., 2007), the faecal\u2013oral transmission route is common. Appropriate hygiene and husbandry standards can reduce the spread of these organisms amongst animals, and between animals and humans, in captive environments. However, for those workers tasked with the collection of undigested coffee beans from civet faeces in the production of civet coffee (D'Cruze et al., 2014), they present a significant, ongoing occupational hazard which must be addressed.",

These pathogens are considered \u2018neglected\u2019 because they are poorly studied and commonly ignored by donors, policy makers and public health officials (Maudlin et al., 2009); however, they continue to cause widespread morbidity and mortality in the poorer regions of the world (Hotez et al., 2007; WHO, 2010). Identification of the pathogens responsible for NTDs in captive viverrids contributes to our understanding of potential animal reservoirs for these diseases, knowledge which is vital to the development of interventions aimed at their control or elimination (Zinsstag et al., 2007).",

A novel lyssavirus, the ikoma lyssavirus, was subsequently isolated from the civet (Marston et al., 2012). Although the pathogenicity of Ikoma Lyssavirus to humans is unknown, and further research is required to understand its prevalence and distribution (Marston et al., 2012), this case highlighted the risk of disease emergence when immunologically na\u00efve people come into close and unnatural proximity with wild animals.",

Direct contact between viverrids and people in an urban environment leading to disease transmission was reported in Japan, where cat scratch fever (caused by the gram\u2010negative bacteria Bartonella henselae) was transmitted to a man via a scratch from a free\u2010ranging Masked palm civet (Table 2) (Sato et al., 2013). Peri\u2010urban wildlife may also serve as sylvatic reservoirs for zoonotic disease (Weiss and McMichael, 2004), as reported for African civet, believed to contribute to the maintenance and cycling of the mongoose biotype of the rabies virus (Sabeta et al., 2008), and Masked palm civet, considered a maintenance host of the enteric pathogens Salmonella, Campylobacter spp. and Yersinia (Table 2) in Japan (Lee et al., 2011).",

A number of these have clear and serious implications for viverrid health, and as such, this information facilitates sensible health management of both wild and captive viverrids, and provides a knowledge base from which future research, surveillance programmes and disease outbreak investigations can be developed. As the vast majority of organisms listed here are also capable of infecting a wide range of hosts, including humans, many may also pose a risk to public health.
