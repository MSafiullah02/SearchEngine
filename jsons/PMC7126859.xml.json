Based on pathogenicity in experimental animals, human enteroviruses have been subgrouped into polioviruses (PV; 3 serotypes), coxsackie A viruses (CAV; 23 serotypes), coxsackie B viruses (CBV; 6 serotypes), echoviruses (EV; 28 serotypes), and enteroviruses 68\u201371. The outcome of enterovirus infections in man varies from minor respiratory illnesses to paralysis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis and generalized infections with multiorgan failure in newborns (Grist et al., 1978). Most of the enterovirus infections, however, are assumed to be asymptomatic. Although several enterovirus serotypes can cause many of the illnesses mentioned, there are disease entities that are typically caused by one or only a few serotypes. These include epidemic poliomyelitis (PVs), hand-foot-and-mouth disease (mainly CAV16), acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (CAV24 and enterovirus 70), herpangina (certain CAVs) and pleurodynia (CBVs) (Grist et al., 1978).",

Moreover, HRV infections may result in sinusitis, otitis media, or exacerbation of asthma (Pitk\u00e4ranta and Hayden, 1998). Due to its unique pathogenicity and genetic distance when compared to other picornaviruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV), previously designated as enterovirus 72, was reclassified in hepatovirus genus (Minor, 1991). More recently, two echoviruses (serotypes 22 and 23) with exceptional molecular properties have been assigned to a new genus, parechovirus (Hyypi\u00e4 et al., 1992, Stanway et al., 1994, Mayo and Pringle, 1998).

Serological detection of enterovirus-specific antibodies provides indirect evidence of the etiology of the disease. Diagnosis of HAV infections is based on demonstration of specific IgM-class antibodies. In general, the isolation methods currently used for picornavirus identification are cumbersome, laborious and insensitive. Even at its best, several days are required for specific diagnosis. Hence, the introduction of newly developed molecular techniques into picornavirus diagnosis that provide means for faster and more sensitive virus detection has been highly appreciated. These methods improve not only laboratory diagnosis and clinical management of picornavirus infections, but increase knowledge of the clinical importance of human picornaviruses. The authors summarize here recent advances in RT-PCR and sequence analysis of human picornaviruses which, together with in situ hybridization techniques, have significantly improved the virological laboratory diagnosis of these infections.",

            "text": "The picornavirus genome is an \u22487000\u20139000 nucleotides (nt) long, single-stranded RNA molecule. The long open reading frame, coding for the capsid and nonstructural proteins, is preceded by a 5\u2032 noncoding region (5\u2032NCR; 750 nt in enteroviruses). This region contains several conserved motifs which participate in the formation of secondary structures required for translation and replication of the virus genome. Most of the RT-PCR assays described have taken advantage of these homologous regions which are shared by entero- and rhinoviruses (Fig. 1\n). Because the amplification products are usually of a similar length, a specific oligonucleotide probe is needed for discrimination between the two picornavirus groups (Hyypi\u00e4 et al., 1989, Santti et al., 1997). Alternatively, a primer may be targetted to a conserved region in the VP2 capsid protein gene and used together with another primer from the 5\u2032NCR (Olive et al., 1990). An advantage with this primer pair is that the entero- and rhinovirus amplicons differ in length, due to an apparent deletion in the HRV genome in the region preceding the initiation codon. It has been shown in a number of studies that virtually all the enterovirus serotypes and most of the HRV isolates can be detected using these primer sequences (Hyypi\u00e4 et al., 1989, Horsnell et al., 1995, Pulli et al., 1995, Arola et al., 1996, Huttunen et al., 1996, Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1997, Hyypi\u00e4 et al., 1998, Oberste et al., 1998)",

Specimens including CSF, throat swabs, stool samples and sera were collected from the first eight patients with typical symptoms. The etiological agent was identified as an enterovirus from CSF by RT-PCR (Arola et al., 1996), after which this technique was mainly used for virological diagnosis. RT-PCR was positive from seven of the eight CSF samples, while virus isolation was positive from three CSF, throat swabs and stool specimens, all from the same three patients (Table 2\n). RT-PCR from serum samples gave positive diagnosis in five patients including one patient whose CSF remained negative in the RT-PCR test.

(1997)]. Partial sequence analysis of virtually all enterovirus serotypes has shown that they belong to these four clusters (Pulli et al., 1995, Huttunen et al., 1996) and that the VP4/VP2 region sequence can be used for molecular typing of clinical isolates (Arola et al., 1996). It is notable, however, that, for instance, polioviruses cannot be discriminated from CAVs in the C cluster by this means and other genomic regions are required for the purpose. In the 5\u2032NCR the clustering of enterovirus serotypes is different and does not provide a useful tool for typing, but can be used in some epidemiological studies. Although genetic clustering can also be detected among HRVs (Horsnell et al., 1995), the correlation of this grouping with pathogenesis of infection is not currently clear.",

The global eradication program has significantly benefitted from these studies. A region of 150 nt in the junction of the structural gene VP1 and the viral protease gene 2A has been universally adopted for this purpose. The term genotype, which is defined as a cluster of genetically related viruses with <15% nucleotide sequence divergence, has been used for poliovirus strains (Rico-Hesse et al., 1987). Within each serotype, the independent genotypes usually have distinct geographic distribution, consistent with the existence of separate foci of endemicity. These studies have provided an invaluable insight into the pathways of virus transmission and epidemiologic links.",

These include the two serotypes responsible for large outbreaks of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, CAV24 variant (CAV24v; Ishiko et al., 1992) and enterovirus 70 (Takeda et al., 1994). Regression analysis of the genetic distances between isolates has enabled estimation of the time of emergence of these viruses. The viruses were predicted to originate from single focal places; CAV24v in November 1963\u00b121 months, about 7 years before the first isolation of the virus in Singapore, and enterovirus 70 in August 1967\u00b115 months, 2 years before recognition of the virus in a pandemic of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The molecular epidemiology of CAV9, CBV1 and CBV5 as well as echovirus 30 which is characteristically involved in epidemics of meningitis has also been studied (Chang et al., 1992, Zoll et al., 1994, Kopecka et al., 1995, Gj\u00f8en et al., 1996). In hepatitis A virus infections, the molecular epidemiology has been investigated by many reseach groups and an extensive analysis of partial sequences from different geographic locations has been used to establish a useful database for further studies (Robertson et al., 1992). Recently, an RT-PCR assay was also developed for the detection of parechovirus 1 in clinical samples and the amplicons, representing the 5\u2032NCR, were used in epidemiological analysis (Joki-Korpela and Hyypi\u00e4, 1998).",
