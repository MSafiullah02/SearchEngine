Between Jan 1 st to Mar 28 th , 2020, when the outbreak was at its peak in the city, 679 patients received treatment in the Tongji radiotherapy (RT) center, only one of which was later confirmed to have contracted COVID-19, demonstrating the effectiveness of our measures. It is therefore our sincere wish to share the experience with the global community.",
