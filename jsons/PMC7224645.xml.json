His exquisite tenderness and skin changes required emergent repair. With penetrating fear in his eyes, he told his surgical team of his siblings who had both gotten sick and passed in the last year. His fear of becoming sick or dying was recognized and acknowledged \u2013 who wouldn't be afraid in his position; but he was safe now, in the care of physicians who knew exactly how to fix the cause of his pain. There was no better place for him to have his problem than in the hospital. Now he was here, and everything else was in our hands. His trembling grip and imploring gaze made clear his fear felt seen but was not mitigated. As a surgeon, bringing patients' anxiety and fear into quiescence is as close as one can come to a nonsurgical remedy, knowing that the true resolution of their fear happens under the blade of a knife and the curtain of sedation.",

A crash cart appeared. The room populated within minutes. He became profoundly hypoxic. After half an hour of ACLS, he finally regained return of spontaneous circulation. His bedside EKG and echo showed antero-lateral infarction with a hypokinetic septal wall consistent with ischemia of his left anterior descending coronary artery \u2013 he had suffered a massive heart attack. His road toward recovery now led him to ECMO and the catheterization lab.",

For the determinists, perhaps a world without a pandemic would have still resulted in these events in some other way. But to extend one's hand to a patient in treacherous waters and watch a buoy become an anchor places the weight of unseen costs of this pandemic on a very personal set of shoulders.",

The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment introduced in 1905 \u2013 to watch a train go down the main track and kill five people, or to flip a switch for the trolley to go down a side track, killing only one, but then becoming directly responsible for that person's death. While typical variants include changing the number of people on each track or making one of the possible victims the switchman's family member, the current variant brings a tremendous number of considerations:\u2022As the train moves forward, the number of people on both the main and side tracks increases, but the actual number at each track is unknown. The mortality and morbidity associated with being in the way of the trolley is also unknown. Some may survive only to be injured, others may survive with no sign of injury at all.\u2022There are groups of people demanding that it is a violation of their rights to not be positioned on the main track. They are eventually on the main track and their occupation of resources puts additional people on the side track.\u2022The governing body supplying funding for the trolley, reopens ticket sales for additional passengers, who find themselves on the main track in the path of the trolley. Investing in the trolley also lengthens the tracks, increasing the amount of time before the trolley hits and thus the number of people on either track.\u2022The tracks do not target isolated groups of people; rather, there is an infinite number of options that will result in morbidity and mortality in both groups to varying degrees.\u2022The number of subsequent groups of people on main and side tracks (i.e. second and third waves) are dictated by current decisions with an impact that can be anticipated but not predictable.\n",

How long will our patients wait at home until their elective surgeries become urgent? How long can you treat a patient's cancer with chemotherapy before their cancer becomes unresectable? How will patients be affected by increasing length of stay by several days for follow up studies to avoid returning to clinic, or by decreasing length of stay for patients who are sent home from the hospital with monitoring devices and telehealth to decrease exposure? With data and guidelines changing continuously, it is important to maintain ongoing, transparent discussions of frameworks developed by different institutions to provide care for our patients.",

Alabama has been fortunate enough to be trending somewhere between the early and late phase recovery of the ACS guidelines. The decision to start caring for patients who have been getting sicker at home is based on an incredibly complicated trolley dilemma in which the focus is on damage control, both actively and in anticipation. Though the current burden of the pandemic is different in every state, eventually each will need to determine whether it is an appropriate time to resume \u201celective\u201d cases, as well as tier which cases are to be resumed at which time. As the ACS described, \u201cunderstanding both the local facility capabilities (e.g., beds, testing, operating rooms [ORs]) as well as potential constraints (e.g., workforce, supply chain), while keeping an eye on potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 will continue to be important.\u201d",

In addition, there is no clear evidence on permanent immunity against COVID-19. Until testing capabilities are able to select and isolate only those who are known to be infected with COVID-19 or the development of a vaccine can successfully reduce S, spread can only be minimized by decreasing i not only through containment of the symptomatic, but additionally by restricting interactions among the symptomatic and asymptomatic alike.",
