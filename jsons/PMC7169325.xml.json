The high margin of viral safety can be attributed to a number of measures that manufacturers have implemented during the last decade. These measures are part of a multifaceted strategy for pathogen safety that includes donor screening, donation testing, virus inactivation or removal measures during manufacture, strict adherence to good manufacturing procedures and post\u2010use surveillance of products. However, recent outbreaks of emergent viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010associated coronavirus and monkeypox, have indicated that potential threats to the blood supply exist and have resulted in a re\u2010evaluation of the current pathogen safety strategy for plasma products.",

            "text": "Although donor deferral and plasma donation screening effectively provide safety for known pathogens, the presence of a new or emergent virus cannot be detected when its existence is not anticipated. Consequently, robust viral clearance procedures within manufacturing processes are critical. The capacity of these procedures to remove or inactivate viruses is validated in small\u2010scale studies in which high levels of virus are spiked into a manufacturing intermediate and the reduction of infectious virus is measured. Typically, a number of these experiments are performed, each using a different virus that could potentially be present in plasma. Some potential contaminants, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and parvovirus B19, cannot be readily cultured in vitro. For viruses like these, a closely related virus with similar physicochemical properties, and which can be easily propagated in the laboratory, is used [1]. Like HCV, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is a member of the Flaviviridae and has been used for many years as a model for HCV. Other viruses, such as the Flaviviruses yellow fever virus and tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus, as well as the Alphaviruses Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus, have also been used to model HCV. Inactivation/removal of BVDV and other HCV model viruses by various manufacturing processes has effectively represented HCV clearance, as evidenced by the lack of HCV transmission by products which have claimed significant levels of BVDV clearance.",

Most WNV\u2010infected individuals have subclinical infections, with a short, but defined, viraemic period. During epidemics of WNV infection, when the prevalence of viraemia within the population is high, the risk of a viraemic blood or plasma donor is also high. In fact, in 2003, WNV was transmitted to transplant recipients from an infected organ donor and to recipients of whole blood and platelets from infected donors [2]. This resulted in the implementation of a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010endorsed WNV screening programme for whole blood. The programme includes donor deferral questions and nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) [3, 4, 5]. The FDA and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) concur with manufacturers of plasma products that various viral\u2010inactivation measures used during the processing of these products are sufficient to provide a high degree of safety for this virus [3, 6].",

VV is a unique enveloped virus, with complex lipid membrane structures [9]. Although some studies have evaluated VV inactivation, it is not always included in the panel of viruses used for virus clearance studies for plasma\u2010derived products. WNV, a member of the Flaviviridae, is closely related to BVDV, which has been used for many years as a model for HCV. It would be expected, then, that WNV inactivation would be similar to that of BVDV, and that WNV\u2010inactivation studies could verify the validity of using BVDV as a model for virus\u2010inactivation studies. The virus\u2010inactivation data presented here demonstrate that current virus\u2010inactivation procedures provide inactivation of WNV and VV and support the use of virus\u2010inactivation data from model viruses.",
