Embryonic cells can be passaged many more times than cells taken from adults. Some types of cells (for example, fibroblasts) divide more readily than do cells that are normally nondividing in the adult animal (for example, neurons). Tumors provide another source of cells for virus culture. Tumor-derived cells can often be passaged indefinitely. These immortalized cells are excellent tools for the virologist. They are relatively easy to culture, many types are commercially available and they can be genetically modified. Multiple genes can be introduced, mutated, or deleted to generate an unlimited supply of \u201cdesigner\u201d cells.Box 4.1Serologic AssaysSerologic assays use the power of antibody\u2013antigen interactions (the ability of an antibody to bind its cognate antigen with high specificity).A primary antibody is one that binds a specific antigen. If HIV is the antigen, the primary antibodies are those that bind to HIV proteins. For a direct ELISA, the primary antibodies are chemically linked to a fluorescent tag or an enzyme tag.A secondary antibody is one that binds to a primary antibody. If the primary antibody is human-anti-HIV (from an infected patient, for example), the secondary antibody recognizes the human antibody. The secondary antibody might be rabbit, mouse, or goat antihuman IgG. The benefit of using a secondary antibody is that a single aliquot of secondary antibody can be used to detect many different human antibodies, regardless of what antigen those antibodies bind.",

In contrast, if the virus is highly cell-associated, the cells must be gently lysed to release the virus. Mixtures of virus and cell debris are subjected to low-speed (~5000\u00d7g) centrifugation to pellet cell debris, but not the much smaller virions. At the end of the low-speed centrifugation, the liquid supernatant, containing the virus, is saved and the pellet (containing the cell debris) is discarded.

The gradient is prepared and the virus sample layered carefully onto the top. During centrifugation, the components of the sample will separate into layers depending on their buoyant density. By using a gradient, one can achieve a finer separation of the different macromolecules within a sample.

The microscope is designed so that only the emission light (fluorescence) reaches the eye or detector, allowing fluorescent structures to be seen with high contrast against a dark background.

DAPI (Fig. 4.3\n) can pass through an intact cell membrane thus can be used to stain both live and fixed cells. It is used extensively in fluorescence microscopy to label the cell nucleus because it binds to ds DNA. Different fluorochromes are excited by specific wavelengths of irradiating light and emit light of defined wavelength and intensity.

Alexa dyes (Fig. 4.4\n) are a series of fluorescent molecules that are widely used as fluorochromes. Among the Alexa dyes, there are choices of molecules with a variety of excitation and emission spectra. If different Alexa dyes are attached to different molecules, cell images can be collected using filters specific for each color. The relationship of one macromolecule to another can be determined by overlaying the images. For example, if a green image and a red image are superimposed, yellow pixels are seen where the tagged macromolecules colocalize in the cell.Box 4.2Variations of the ELISA can be used for Antigen or Antibody Detection\nDirect ELISA. Primary antibodies (i.e., anti-influenza virus antibodies) are chemically linked to enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (AP). These reagents facilitate detection of viral antigens in a sample. If a fluorescent molecule is attached to the primary antibody, the assay is a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay.\nIndirect ELISA. The primary antibody is untagged, but a tagged secondary antibody is used to detect the presence of primary antibody. For example, if the primary antibody is developed in an immunized rabbit, the secondary antibody is anti-rabbit IgG (perhaps obtained from mice immunized with rabbit IgG). Indirect ELISAs are common because it is cheaper to tag one batch of antirabbit IgG than to tag the specific antibodies directed against hundreds of different viral (or other) proteins.\nSandwich ELISA. The antigen of interest is \u201csandwiched\u201d between two antibodies. An antibody or a serum sample is used to coat the dish or tube. A sample containing an antigen is added and allowed to bind to the antibody. A second antibody is added to the wells. It will bind to the antigen (if present). In this example the antigen must be able to interact with two antibodies. Requiring that two different antibodies react with the same antigen can improve the specificity of the assay.",

Genes encoding cellular or viral proteins can be modified by addition of the GFP gene to create a \u201ctagged\u201d protein.

Confocal microscopy can image either fixed or living cells that have been labeled with one or more fluorescent probes. The excitation energies required to reach deep into the cells are very high and specimen damage can result. In contrast deconvolution methods employ conventional widefield fluorescence microscopes for image acquisition. Excitation intensities can be kept low, resulting in less damage to the specimen.

EM uses an electron beam in place of light, and the beam is focused by electromagnets, rather than by glass lenses. EM has great resolving power and can magnify objects by up to ~10,000,000 times. Disadvantages of EM are that fixed and processed samples are dead, and biological samples are heavily damaged by the electron beam even as they are being imaged (sample damage results from the interaction of electrons with organic matter). However, the simple structures and crystalline nature of viruses were first revealed by EM and it remains a common tool of the virologist. In a process called negative staining, heavy metals are used to coat the surface of virus particles to make a \u201ccast\u201d or \u201crelief map\u201d (Fig. 4.6\n). The heavy metal coating is much less sensitive to radiation damage than the biological sample, thus the coated surface structures are well preserved.

Cryofixation of samples produces a glass-like (vitrified) material rather than crystalline ice. Cryo-EM allows the observation of specimens that have not been chemically stained or fixed, thus showing them in their native aqueous environment. Low temperatures provide for better images with less specimen damage, but cryo-EM micrographs have less contrast than stained images. Cryo-EM images are more complex than negative stains because the entire particle (including the interior) is seen in the image. However, thicker frozen specimens can be cut into thin sections using a cryoultramicrotome. Images generated by cryo-EM are often enhanced by collecting and computationally averaging multiple images. This allows use of lower and less damaging doses of electrons. Tomography is a process whereby a series of images are taken with the specimen tilted at different angles relative to the direction of the electron beam. The images are computationally combined to create 3D images (tomograms) of the sample. Extremely high-resolution (<4 \u00c5) images have been achieved for icosahedral viruses because they are constructed from many repeating subunits that can be computationally averaged. Cryo-EM, while a powerful technique, requires expensive and specialized equipment and highly trained personnel (Fig. 4.8\n).",

The HA is fast and inexpensive and does not require either sophisticated instrumentation or extensive training. It is done by preparing serial dilutions of a virus sample. An aliquot of each dilution is added to RBCs in a microtiter plate well or test tube. One well contains RBCs and saline (negative control) and another contains a known positive reference sample of virus. The samples are gently mixed and allowed to sit at room temperature. In the negative wells the RBCs will slide down to form a tight button at the bottom of the tube. In positive wells the RBCs and virions will bind to each other to form a mesh of cells on the bottom of the tube.

Antigen detection ELISAs can be used to quantitate the amount of virus in a cell culture supernatant or patient sample. In this case the primary antibody is a purchased and/or standardized reagent.

            "text": "While PCR amplification requires some prior knowledge of a viral sequence, it is now routine to sequence all nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) in a sample, using high throughput, unbiased sequencing techniques. Sequencing technologies can provide a genome\u2019s worth of data (billions of nucleotides) in a day. Powerful algorithms are used to analyze the data and compare it to information stored in public databases. Sequences of no interest (human DNA in a patient sample) can be ignored, allowing the investigator to quickly focus on any viral sequences that may be present. As in the case of PCR, the sensitivity of the assay is both a positive and a negative, and the most careful researchers will include multiple negative controls in their assays. Use of unbiased sequencing has resulted in an explosion of new viruses from humans, animals, and environmental samples. The current challenge is to develop an understanding of which viruses might be threats and which are part of our normal viral flora.Box 4.4Common Biochemical and Molecular Techniques for Investigative Virology (2)\nFlow Cytometry. Cells are suspended in a stream of fluid and flow past an electronic detection apparatus. The number of cells passing the detector is counted. Thousands of cells per second can be counted. Often cells are labeled with fluorescent dyes (tagged antibodies, for example) and are not only counted, but are separated into different collection tubes based on labeling patterns. The process is often used to get pure populations of cells from a mixture. Immunologists take advantage of the fact that different types of proteins are found on the surfaces of different types of lymphocytes. Thus labeled antibodies can be used to quantitate and separate different lymphocyte subsets from a blood sample. Not only can the presence of a molecule on the cell surface be detected, but the relative amounts can be determined as well. Flow cytometry is also used for viral diagnostics. Cells infected with an unknown agent can be incubated with panels of antibodies.\nReverse Genetics. Virologists study viral genes to determine their functions. Historically this was accomplished by finding and purifying mutant viruses to determine how they differed from their \u201cwild-type\u201d parents. With the development of gene cloning technologies, virologists are able to clone entire viral genomes, manipulate them in the laboratory (introduce specific mutations) and examine the effects on virus replication or disease. Introducing specific mutation is the \u201creverse\u201d of traditional genetic method of identifying a mutant phenotype and then determining the genetic cause. In order to do reverse genetics, the virologist usually starts with a cloned viral genome that can be introduced into cells to produce infectious virus.\nDesigner Cells and Designer Animals. In addition to mutating viral genes, virologists manipulate the hosts as well. It is relatively easy to add, delete, or modify the genetic makeup of cultured cells. Animal genomes can be modified as well. Systems to create designer mice are reasonably efficient and hundreds of types of genetically modified mice are commercially available. What is gained by modifying the host? At every step in the virus life cycle, viral proteins interact with cellular proteins and a single viral protein may interact with dozens of cellular proteins. To analyze the effects of just one type of interaction, it may be preferable to modify the host genome. It is also possible to genetically alter a resistant host to render it susceptible to a virus. For example, the receptor for a human virus could be added to mouse cells to generate a tractable animal model. It can be challenging for a student of virology, new to reading scientific literature, to determine the types of virus or host mutations that have been used to obtain data for a specific study. But this is critical to understanding and evaluating experimental results.",

Some are designed to detect viral proteins, enzymes, or genomes directly from a patient sample (blood, throat swab) and these are useful in a clinical setting. One type of rapid diagnostic assay design (lateral flow immunoassay) uses the process of diffusion to move a sample across a test chamber. The liquid sample contacts various dried reagents as it flows through the chamber. Among the strengths of the lateral flow immunoassay is the ability provide rapid diagnostic capabilities in a medical/veterinary setting. Tests can be designed to detect either antigen or antibody from a patient sample. An example of an antigen capture assay is shown in Fig. 4.17\n. The test strip contains three key assay reagents (dried on the strip). Closest to the sample addition chamber is an antiviral antibody. In our example the antibody is conjugated to gold nanoparticles. When the liquid from the patient sample is applied, it flows, by capillary action, across the slide and will encounter the labeled antibody. The labeled antibody is picked up in the flowing liquid and will bind to any viral antigen present in the sample. The liquid continues to move across the slide (by capillary action) until it hits the Test (T) strip. In our example the T strip contains antibody to the virus in question. If the labeled antibody is bound to virus, it will be stopped (captured) at the test strip. If the labeled antibody is not bound to virus, it will move past the T strip and reach the control (C) strip. Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies are bound at the C strip and will capture any labeled immunoglobulin in the liquid. Thus if the sample is positive for virus, a colored line should appear at the T strip and the C strip (because there is excess labeled antibody). If the sample is negative for virus, the T strip will remain colorless but the C strip will be positive.",

Any of these changes in the infected cell cultures (as compared to uninfected controls) provides an indication that an agent is replicating, and that further testing is warranted to identify the agent.
