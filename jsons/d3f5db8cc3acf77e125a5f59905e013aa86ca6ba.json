Accordingly, much of the government's infection prevention and control guidance for COVID-19 is centred around minimising transmission via these methods. The coronaviruses implicated in the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks caused enteric manifestations in conjunction with the respiratory symptoms experienced by many with COVID-19. Since the early retrospective cohort studies of patients in Wuhan, more recent observational studies report common gastrointestinal symptoms to be more prevalent than previously thought. 1 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNA were frequently detected in stool specimens of infected individuals. The New England Journal of Medicine case report of the first COVID-19 patient in the USA detected high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in their stool sample. 2 Experts recognise the hypothesised faecal-oral route to be a plausible mode of transmission.",
