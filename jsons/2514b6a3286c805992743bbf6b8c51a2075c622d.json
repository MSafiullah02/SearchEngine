It is important to consider that although the difference of IPD incidence between study periods did not reach statistically significance, cases of IPD in the PCV13 era were more common in patients with comorbidities. We consider that phenomena as an indirect indicator of vaccine effectiveness. Likewise, cases of IPD in patients with sickle cell anemia trended down in our cohort. This is most likely a consequence of PCV vaccination enforced in this population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 134, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 135, "end": 138, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Introduction of new viral detection technologies has prompted the analysis of viral coinfection of patients with IPD [26] .

It is notable that rhinovirus seems to stimulate S pneumoniae adhesion to airway epithelial cells [27] .

Approximately 10% of pneumococcal isolates were not available for typing or were found to be nontypeable. Most of those samples belong to the pre-PCV era (1999) (2000) . We began prospective collection of samples from the CMCD microbiology laboratory late in 2000. In addition, MLST was not available starting 2011. However, only 2 isolates were classified as nontypeable during the PCV13 period. Our study was based on results from a single tertiary referral center, and hence, our findings may not be generalizable to other areas of the country. Children's Medical Center Dallas is the major referral center in the area, covering most of the pediatric population of the Dallas area. However, there are other medical centers, which were not included in the study, and the incidence of IPD could be overestimated or underestimated. Finally, although we could not associate vaccination status of individuals to development of IPD, we can point out that average PCV vaccination rates were slightly lower in the Dallas area compared with other areas of surveillance in the country. These findings could potentially contribute to some of the differences contained in this study in comparison with other reports.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 192, "text": "(1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 193, "end": 199, "text": "(2000)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our findings show an overall reduction of IPD after introduction of PCV13 in the Dallas area. Penicillin resistance among bacterial isolates and occurrence of IPD caused by serotype 19A are decreasing as well. Interestingly, we documented persistence of PCV7 serotypes in the PCV13 era. The group with the most significant reduction of IPD corresponded to children younger than 24 months with the highest impact by clinical syndrome seen in the pneumonia group. Patients with comorbidities represented a significant percentage of patients with IPD. Additionally, concerns for geographic variation in serotype replacement phenomena arise from the present study. Continuing careful monitoring through national and international population-based IPD surveillance is necessary to determine the long-term impact of PCV13. Groups of emerging serotypes (including persistence of PCV7 serotypes), changes in antimicrobial susceptibility, and possible geographic differences in serotype distribution should be addressed in future studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Messina", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Katz-Gaynor", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Barton", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "Pediatr Infect Dis J", "volume": "26", "issn": "", "pages": "461--468", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Safety and immunogenicity of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bryant", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Block", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Baker", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "Pediatrics", "volume": "125", "issn": "", "pages": "866--75", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Early trends for invasive pneumococcal infections in children after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Kaplan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Barson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Lin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Pediatr Infect Dis J", "volume": "32", "issn": "", "pages": "203--210", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Team.
