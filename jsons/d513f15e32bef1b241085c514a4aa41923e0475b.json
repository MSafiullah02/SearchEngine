In this article we identify a class of these distribution systems that add value to merchandise through presentations to customers that have been identified as enchanted (p. 4, Ritzer, 2010) . Most studies explicating the role of enchantment in consumption have focused on brick and mortar distribution channels where customers directly interact with merchandise or experiences. However, many sectors now feature multi-channel retail options for consumers including mediated and digital avenues. For example, retailers may sell goods at brick and mortar stores, in outlet stores, by catalog, through company websites, or at seasonal channels such as pop-up stores. The variety of possible distribution channels experienced by consumers produces, in turn, a variety of shopping alternatives that are intrinsic parts of the consumption experience. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, many of these channels of distribution have been severely curtailed. Government stay-at-home orders caused a large percentage of brick and mortar stores to close, leaving many retailers with primarily digital channels to distribute their goods. These wrenching changes may have lasting impact with digital channels increasing in importance for many sectors of the economy. Given these on-going changes to distribution, we delve into how enchantment might be digitally articulated in mediated shopping situations, paying attention to the cultural techniques and affordances of the platforms and spaces, often in contrast to traditional distribution channels.",

The varieties of distribution channels now available continue to create diversity in the retail environments experienced by consumers. Such experiences and the differences between them are important, with many channels enabling shopping experiences that are significant extensions of simple product selection. For example, Nordstrom has recently opened small neighborhood-based stores dubbed \"Nordstrom Local\" that have little or no clothing stock but rather are locations for customers to interact with stylists, try on clothes, and place and pickup online orders (Hsu, 2017) . Locals also offer tailoring services and manicures in an effort to create an alternative shopping environment.",

As the logistical channels that bring goods and services to consumers are strategically enchanted, an additional method of establishing value in distribution channels is established. We contextualize this process by considering factors that drive the perceived value of goods and services within channels of distribution. Beyond the contributions of traditional value chains to products, differing modes of distribution may contribute independently to the perceived value of products, thus allowing and even requiring a broad view of the value acquisition process in distribution-a view that may include the enchantment of distribution channels. In their presentation of a service-dominant logic of marketing, Lusch and his associates (c.f. Lusch, Vargo, & Tanniru, 2010; Vargo & Lusch, 2004; Lusch, 2011) have used an ecological metaphor to conceptualize ways that various stakeholders interact as they exchange goods and services. So, for example, associated with each product will be a network of customers, dealers, original equipment manufacturers, and tiers of suppliers interacting with each other in a dynamic exchange ecology. Moreover, the advent of the Internet has reshaped value networks so that economic advantages previously held by certain stakeholders have been moved to others within the networks (c.f. Yakhlef, 2011). Logistics services-traditionally the operational processes that enable transactions between those who supply goods and services and their customers-become an integral part of the marketing process and are subsumed under such value networks.",

Organizations using relevant logistics solicit information about specific customer needs and then develop solutions based on those identified needs. For example, when an integrated service provider customizes a mass mailing to meet a customer's specific scheduling requirements, when a manufacturer integrates a particular array of electronic features into a product in order to achieve the functionality a customer requires, or even when a particular fabric is selected for an article of clothing so that it will be fashionable, the logistics involved create value because the service rendered is relevant to customers.

            "text": "Conceptualizing producer-customer exchanges as enchanted or disenchanted historically stems from Weber's (1905 Weber's ( /2002 description of the introduction of rationalism into economic and administrative realms. In his analysis, pre-modern life was mediated by magic and mystery; the advent of modernity led to systematic increases in formal rationality, supplanting a mystical, enchanted worldview and evolving into a more systematically organized secular society. Campbell (1987) provides an alternative analysis that admits a re-enchantment of rationalized systems of consumption motivated by self-illusory hedonism. According to Campbell, we consume goods not simply for utilitarian reasons but also to fulfill our consumerist daydreamsyearnings that make the process of consuming an enchanting experience. When reality fails to measure up to our daydreams, we are disappointed but inevitably re-enter the market in further search of satisfaction. The cycle repeats itself endlessly as our needs to re-experience yearning generate new desires. Weber (1905 Weber ( /2002 sees the process of disenchantment as an irreversible state of modernity while Campbell (1987) views the possibility of re-enchantment as essentially a product of potential consumer's imaginations. In building on Campbell's approach, Ritzer (2010) argued that although re-enchantment may ultimately be futile in searching for meaning in consumption practices, re-enchantment nonetheless serves as an offset to highly rationalized and controlling marketing practices. More recently, post-modern thinkers have seen the processes of disenchantment and re-enchantment as sociohistoric constructions that are in a process of continual \"fruitful tension\" (Saler, 2006, p. 700) where combinations of rationalizing and enchanting elements are present simultaneously.",

Such farms typically sell produce by subscription in a commune format-delivering some rather arbitrary selection of organic produce (what is ripe in a particular week) to local consumers on a weekly basis. By participating in community-supported agriculture, consumers eat local and thereby re-territorialize their food. According to this formulation, enchantment is strongly tied to place as consumers see themselves as making environmentally supportive and ethically correct choices. Through sympathetic magical connections contact is forged with the \"land\" and the life-giving forces it represents while at the same time rejecting the values and ideology associated with industrialized agribusiness.",

In the first, we look at Target Inc., a large brick and mortar discount chain. Although Target has made a strong commitment to its ecommerce business, the retailer still sold only 4.4% of its goods via a digital channel in 2017 (Target, 2020) and so must primarily be considered a brick and mortar retailer. The store has also done little to involve customers in its value network, relying instead on traditional marketing approaches. Nonetheless, Target has been successful in attracting customers with designer collaborations and we describe their use of digital technology as a way to engage customers by identifying clothing that they prefer. Second, we examine enchantment at Amazon as an example of how enchantment can take place in a value network that is almost exclusively digital (Denegri-Knott & Molesworth, 2010) . Finally, we turn to Koji BBQ, a hybrid organization that, like Target, distributes its products in face-to-face interactions, but like Amazon, uses digital technology as an integral part of its logistics. These differing cases allow us to identify characteristics of digital enchantment that may be applied in organizations that function in a variety of value networks.",

However, beyond this, Target's use of a relatively more open value network produced by carrying a clothing line that already looks desirable to customers-has introduced the element of intrigue or enchantment into the shopping process. Such enchantment fosters a degree of engagement with shoppers-engagement with the designer brands presented, with the social media platforms that accompany the Target Who What Wear line, and with merchandise digitally made relevant for customers by engaging them in the curation process.",

Customers cast into the position of being an algorithmic audience experience a degree of enchantment because of the personal relevance of the recommendations presented to them. As a member of an algorithmic audience, customers recognize a connection with other, similar individuals. This connection is extended to validate an association with various subcultures (Hebdige, 1979) , taste cultures (Gans, 1974) , or lifestyles (Holt, 1997) . Such personal validation is desirable and given that recommendations are always instantly available, are both intriguing and rewarding to customers. Notice that it is the consumption practice that is desired and that this is over and above the value that is provided by any specific product. As a result, the recommendation process itself is engaging and enchanting-beyond the utility provided by particular products.",

The use of Twitter has moved these stories from static places online to dramatic emotion-laden episodes that one can act out as adventures. A series of YouTube videos sprung up around the beginning of Kogi as part of its marketing strategy, but also spontaneously as active audiences filmed and put together their own personal treks to find the Kogi tacos. One of the first to do this was a local area DJ named akaider, the title was called 'Chasing the Dragon (The Kogi BBQ Adventure),' and he was later invited to start performing alongside some of the trucks stops in Little Tokyo in response to his video.",

This is mobile hypersocial technology (Ito, 2008) , as Twitter allows for a conversation never before possible. Twitter feeds and tweets tell about the truck coming to an area, if it is stuck in traffic, if the cops made Kogi move to a new area, or if they ran out of food for the day.

The enchantment driven by surprise drives both online and purchases and instore visits. The presentation of the unexpected is also a driver of the popularity of Kogi Tacos. In the transportation-oriented culture of Los Angeles, traveling for food (cruising for burgers) has long been a popular pastime.

By this criterion, things that are scarce are seen as more valuable. Cialdini theorized that the scarcity heuristic operates because of psychological reactance, a negative drive state created by perceived restrictions of freedom or choice (Brehm & Brehm, 1981) . Things that we perceive as scarce come to be perceived as more valuable because not possessing the item is seen as a threat to our freedom.",

Applied to our case studies, the realization by customers that only a limited amount of merchandise is manufactured for each of Target's WhoWhatWear seasons drives demand both in terms of the availability of the merchandise and the amount of time it is available. Both the time and availability conditions restrict choice and potentially create reactance if customers don't buy promptly. To combat such potential restrictions of freedom, customers seek to obtain the scarce merchandise and in addition seek to enjoy the experience of enchantment that accompanies the merchandise. It is critical to note that if the merchandise is sold out, satisfactions from both the item and the enchanted context within which it once was available will be missing. Potential threats to freedom thus impact both merchandise and context. Finally, it is clear that the context in which such merchandise is purchased may be digital or brick and mortar. Highly popular Target merchandise from their designer collaborations has repeatedly crashed their website due to the high volume of customers trying to purchase the limited amount of merchandise on offer (e.g. Wahba, 2015, April 20) . Kogi BBQ operates similarly, as each truck carries only a limited amount of ingredients and when the food is gone, the truck closes. Twitter is full of stories of customers who waited in line for substantial amounts of time only to be denied their food at the last minute. These circumstances all operate to increase the desirability of Kogi's food through the perception of scarcity. Potential restrictions of the choice to eat a Kogi taco drive up both the desirability of the product and the desirability of the enchanted context within which it is consumed. Our case studies support the concept that perceived scarcity and the reactance that it generates can be generated in both digital and brick and mortar contexts.",

For example, Kogi BBQ's minimal advertising budget forced them to rely on the free Twitter platform to alert customers about their often-changing locations. The social media platform meshed with their physical taco truck to create complementary platforms that together were significantly more impactful than the sum of the two considered separately. In the same way, Amazon's expanding physical bookstore chain (Alter and Wingfield, 2016) features books that have been selected based on online customer responses. For example, the in-store cookbook display features only cookbooks that have been rated online as four-star books or higher. The same is true with a variety of other displays. Customers in the physical bookstore are reassured that they are viewing quality, popular books because of the meshing of Amazon's online rating system with the viewing and touching of the physical books. In addition, Amazon Prime customers (a $99.00 per year premium digital membership that features free shipping) receive discounted prices at Amazon physical bookstores. Experiencing multiple interacting platforms lends to an enchanted, transmediated purchasing environment. Both Ritzer, (2005) and Thompson and Coskuner-balli (2007) see enchantment in opposition to the rationalization of business processes. Returning to Campbell (1987) , we consume goods not simply for utilitarian reasons but to also fulfill our consumerist fantasiesconsumption daydreams that make the process of consuming an enchanting experience.",

            "text": "Campbell asserts that our experience will never live up to our fantasies so that although enchantment is a potentially powerful corrective to the rationalization of consumption, it will always fall short. In addition, as Thompson and Coskuner-balli (2007) point out, re-enchantment serves as an ideological veil that obscures the reality that enchantment itself has become rationalized (Ritzer, 2005) . Although a number of the examples presented in this paper support such a conclusion, it is also possible to view re-enchantment within the value networks that a service-dominated logic approach prescribes (Lusch, Vargo, & Tanniru, 2010) . The digital consumption experiences in our case studies make it easy for suppliers to intentionally involve their customers in perfecting and presenting their services so that the goal of relevant logistics can be realized. For example, in Targets's WhoWhatWear designer collaboration, the basis for the choices in this collection was, of course, the design curator's taste, but feedback from Target customers and the Who What Wear website with over two million Twitter followers (Twitter, 2016) was also a significant part of the selection criteria. The collection was produced in part by customers. Under such circumstances, the cynicism that accompanies re-enchantment may well be tempered by customer participation-in the case of Target by customers who recognize their own tastes in the Who What Wear collection. It is important to point out that such customer participation would be impossible without a digital communication channel that allows for customer feedback.",

The company tweets location information, but it is then the choice and responsibility of the customer to commit to the cruise for food. The customer choice and commitment associated with going on the hunt for Kogi tacos is in opposition to a calculated maneuver on the part of the seller and can be seen as a corrective to corporate manipulations. Kogi can be representative of larger cultural shifts and trends.

Rather, a conceptualization of logistics as part of loosely coupled value networks that subsume traditional value and distribution chains suggest that integrating customer participation is essential to provide a complete account of logistical processes. Digital shopping experiences make entry and continued participation in these value networks easy and convenient; and in the case of social distancing, necessary. Our case studies support the view that customers can be enchanted by using ubiquitous digital devices and platforms. As a result, enchantment may be co-produced digitally in cooperation with customers, suggesting that enchanting logistics may not entirely be due to the strict calculations of corporations. As corporations seek to provide logistical solutions that are relevant to customers, digital enchantment becomes a tool that allows for differentiation from competitors and increasing levels of fit between products and consumers.",

            "text": ". In 2008 Target and Mizrahi parted ways, and the company launched a new series of design collaborations. So that Target could achieve its goal of product rotation, these collaborations were intended to be limited in time. For example, in 2009 Target partnered with designer Alexander McQueen to produce the McQ Alexander McQueen for Target collection (Edelson, 2008). Overall, Target has presented collaborations with 150 designers (Wahba, 2015) with varying levels of success. Although sales from the designer collections have contributed only a fraction to Target's bottom line, the interest and consumer excitement generated by the constantly rotating and potentially surprising designer merchandise has created a level of enchantment at a discount chain that would normally be found only at much smaller and more exclusive sellers. More recently Target has opened their value network somewhat through a digitally informed collaboration with the WhoWhatWear.com blog. Developed by Target with Katherine Power and Hillary Kerr, former fashion editors of Elle magazine and co-founders of the WhoWhatWear.com blog, the clothing line showed apparel and accessories curated by Who What Wear in Target stores in February 2016. The basis for their choices in this collection was,of course, their taste, but also digitally collected feedback from Target customers and the Who What Wear website with over two million Twitter followers(Twitter, 2020). In announcing the design collaboration, Katherine Power stated, \"We've kind of taken our expertise as fashion editors and combined it with what our audience truly wants. We're gonna be tapping into, you know, all of the Target guests and all of our social media followers\"(Target-A Bullseye View, 2016). As a result, the collection was produced in part by customers. Under such circumstances, the cynicism that accompanies re-enchantment may well be tempered by customer participation-in the case of Target by customers who recognize their own tastes in the Who What Wear collection.",

Kogi's use of new mediated technology and multiple social media platforms have effectively bridged the gulf between the producer and consumer. No longer is the chef a distant 'other' in the back of a large restaurant, but is now in close proximity, both through food and technology. Taking the food to the streets takes on a form of renaissance--a return to a perhaps mythic age when food was more interactive and participatory. The truck gives a sense of 'street cred' and the raw authenticity associated particularly with long-standing traditions of Mexican taco stands. However, Kogi's manipulation of new technology forged a different relationship with consumers.",
