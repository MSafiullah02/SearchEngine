More than 11 million patients with respiratory chief complaints account for 10.7% of all patients presenting to US Emergency Departments (9). Therefore, knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and complications of human metapneumovirus is essential to the Emergency Physician.",

No chest radiograph was obtained at that time. The cough persisted and the day before presentation to the ED she developed a maximum temperature of 38.4\u00b0C (101.2\u00b0F) orally, increasing cough, and audible wheezing. She had no other significant past medical or birth history, no allergies, and was taking no medications.

Initial examination revealed an alert, well-hydrated female with bilateral rales and wheezing but no retractions, flaring, grunting, or stridor.

Chest radiograph demonstrated a right middle lobe infiltrate and small right pleural effusion consistent with lobar pneumonia (Figure 1). Upon reexamination 90 min after albuterol therapy, she was breathing comfortably with no wheezing, improved oxygenation, and respiratory rate. The lobar infiltrate was assumed to be bacterial superinfection and she was treated with pediazole (erythromycin + sulfasoxazole) orally. Pediatric follow-up was arranged for the following day and she was discharged from the ED with her parents. Her post-ED recovery was uncomplicated.",

Large amounts of heterogeneity within its genome may account for incomplete immunity and recurrent infections that are often seen with this virus (2, 3, 4). Seroprevalence studies have shown that this virus has been circulating among the human population for 50 years and virtually all children older than 5 years show serologic evidence of past infection (1). The age distribution is bimodal, with children < 5 years old and adults aged > 65 years accounting for 35.1% and 45.9% of infections, respectively (2, 3). hMPV infection is highly seasonal, with 86.7% of all hMPV-positive cultures being isolated between December and May (5).",

Symptoms primarily involve the upper respiratory tract, with congestion, cough, and rhinorrhea being the most prevalent (1). The highest incidence of infection is found in young adults, yet the elderly patients with multiple comorbidities have the most clinically significant infections. Dypsnea, wheezing, and hypoxia are usually confined to the elderly and immunocompromised, who present with bronchitis or pneumonitis. In Rochester, New York, 11% of hospitalized adult patients with acute respiratory infections had an associated hMPV infection (1). Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to hMPV also contributes to the increased severity of illness in the elderly. Martinello et al. recently demonstrated a 12% incidence of hMPV infection in patients admitted with a COPD exacerbation (15).",

An increase in host susceptibility to pneumococcal infection due to infection with influenza virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and RSV has been shown in animal and in vitro studies (16). In African children without human immunodeficiency virus, Madhi et al. were able to decrease the incidence of hospitalization for pneumonia associated with influenza A virus by 39%, pneumonia associated with parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133 by 44%, and pneumonia associated with RSV by 32% by immunizing children with 9-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV) (17). These findings suggest that viral infections predispose to pneumococcal coinfection. Bacterial pneumonia coinfection with hMPV was first reported by Boivin et al. in two Canadian children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness. Isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2). Similar to their previous study with other viruses, Madhi et al. recently reported a 58% overall reduction in the incidence of pneumonia associated with hMPV by immunizing with PCV (18). The authors suggest that this is \u201ca conservative estimate of the prevalence of pneumococcal coinfection in children with hMPV\u201d (18).",

In addition to bacterial coinfection, simultaneous infection with RSV and hMPV may lead to increased severity of disease compared with either virus alone. In one series of patients admitted to the ICU with positive hMPV cultures, 75% were also positive for RSV (19). hMPV may also be a significant inciting agent of asthma exacerbations. The incidence of acute asthma exacerbation after hMPV infection has been measured at 8\u201314% (2, 3, 14, 20). There also have been reports of detection of hMPV in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which adds this virus to the list of potentially lethal pathogens. However, a definitive correlation has yet to be established (3, 4, 21, 22). Finally, a fatal case of encephalitis in an infant has also been reported (23). Although these associations are in the preliminary stages, as testing for this virus becomes more readily accessible, the impact of hMPV on the ED is likely to be established.",
