The clinical picture is that of a flu-like syndrome of mild severity in most cases, but in 15% of cases it is complicated by interstitial pneumonia and avariable degree of respiratory failure. Below are some numbers (from 9 March 2020) that give the idea of the virulence of COVID-19.\n",

In Northern Italy, the emergency is progressively involving all cardiology ICUs, not in order to manage cardiovascular complications of the viral infection, but simply to offer beds for treatment of the severe respiratory failure caused by viral interstitial pneumonia. However, the net effect of this reorganization that has been imposed by local and national health authorities is a significant reduction of sites and staff committed to the \u2018usual\u2019 treatment of cardiovascular disease. In particular, elective cardiothoracic operations and interventional procedures are being cancelled. The restriction of free movement between regions imposed by the central government adds to this, with a reduction of cardiology outpatients who\u2014despite everything\u2014decide to access our clinics. This viral emergency, limiting our ability to manage the medical repercussions in the first instance, could have detrimental effects on the entire health system.",

Bearing in mind the dramatic economic cost, how severely should restrictions to free movement, public venue and working place closures be enforced? As physicians, our decision-making is generally based on the risk\u2013benefit assessment of the single individual, but in this case three elements are involved, each with a different degree of validity and vicinity to the decision-maker:",

The acute deprivation of these meetings leads not only to a sudden availability of time, but also to a reduction of intellectual (and thereby neurohormonal) stimulation related to these events, as well as a suspension of routine.",

During \u2018normal\u2019 life, time suspended is generally something positive. Typical examples include school outings, short stays with grandparents during childhood, and vacations in general. If anything, even the classic flu can often generate time suspended, during which, one is not severely ill, aware of the benign prognosis, but at the same time somewhat tried by the illness and takes comfort in a warm bed and being taken care of by family members. On these occasions, one often wishes for the situation to be prolonged.",

On a strictly clinical level, since in most cases the clinical picture is very similar to that of classic flu, the psychological mechanisms mentioned above will be reproduced, but with the major limitation that the prognosis is more uncertain. In this way, despite the data showing that prognosis is benign in 90% of cases, the affected individual\u2014and the physician particularly\u2014needs to manage a variable but creeping burden of anxiety. Outside the clinical context, all (both affected and unaffected) will experience increased anxiety due to travel restrictions, change in working hours and habits and not being able to go out to a bar, caf\u00e9, or restaurant. The deafening silence in campuses and cities binds one in a strange relationship with oneself, and to make things worse, the duration of this period is far from certain.",

Time dilates and the day suddenly lengthens. There is finally time to think, read, write, and make progress with research projects that are underway or need to be initiated, but also, to direct personal energy to a direct relationship with patients. In truth however, this change is by no means simple or automatic. The sudden excess of free time is surprising and leaves a hollow feeling. One realizes how much our usual rhythm, imposed by anxiety and our too many engagements, are actually necessary to maintain an active and productive intellect. Indeed, the restriction of personal contact\u2014that is sometimes yearned for in times of excessive meetings and boards\u2014suddenly becomes a burden. One ascertains for oneself what we try to teach our children and students, i.e. that the internet and social media are not able to surrogate direct personal contact. ",
