Syndromic surveillance is defined as an ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of \"syndrome\"-specific data for early detection of public health aberrations. The rationale behind syndromic surveillance lies in the fact that specific diseases of interest can be monitored by syndromic presentations that can be shown in a timely manner such as nurse calls, medication purchases, and school or work absenteeism. In addition to early detection and reporting of monitored diseases, syndromic surveillance also provides a rich data repository and highly active communication system for situation awareness and event characterization.",

New \"privacy-conscious\" data mining techniques also need to be developed to better protect privacy and patient confidentiality From a policy perspective, there are mainly four sets of issues that need to be studied and related guidelines developed ). The first set is concerned with legal issues. There exist many laws, regulations, et al. 2004) . (Kargupta, Liu et al. 2003; Wylie and Mineau 2003; Ohno-Machado, PS and agreements governing data collection, data confidentiality and reporting, which directly impact the design and operations of IDI systems. The second set is mainly related to data ownership and access control issues. The key questions are: Who are the owner(s) of a particular dataset and derivative data? Who is allowed to input, access, aggregate, or distribute data? The dissemination and alerting needs to be made jointly by organizations across jurisdictions and has to carefully balance the needs for information and possibility of information overflow.

Data standards are also critical to provide unambiguous meaning to data and form the foundation that enables data aggregation as well as data mining. Many data standards have been developed in health care and public health informatics, causing considerable confusion and implementation difficulties. Fortunately, the swarm of data standards applicable to IDI is beginning to narrow to a manageable group by the combined efforts of the National Center for Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS) and the Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) E-Gov initiative (Goldsmith, Blumenthal et al. 2003) . See Table 26 -1 for some of the key standards. While these standards are currently required only for federal government information systems, in all likelihood, data standards adopted by the federal government will be assimilated and adopted by private industry over a relatively short period of time due to the combination of payor (Medicare, Medicaid, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS)) pressures, the sheer size of the federal government health care sector, and the need for private industry to communicate with these government systems. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has also provided funds for encoding hospital laboratory information systems with the intention of helping migrate the systems from local code sets or CPT4 and ICD-9 code systems to LOINC and SNOMED codes that will allow interoperability with local, state, and federal health information systems adhering to CHI standards.",

Among them, Health Level 7 (HL7) is the dominant messaging standard for transfer of clinical information. Almost all hospital information systems exchange HL7 messages and the majority of large private clinical labs have adopted the HL7 standard as well. The current ANSI approved version of HL7 is 2.5; however, several new Version 3 messages for public health reporting have been developed and are being reviewed for implementation as a normative standard. The HL7 Version 3 specification represents a paradigm shift from the flat file structure of the 2.x HL7 versions to an object oriented Reference Information Model (RIM) foundation. This change provides the necessary structure to disambiguate the detailed information in the message and maintain the contextual relationships between data elements that are critical in infectious disease and bioterrorism system to system communication. The CDC has set a goal of using Version 3 messages for morbidity reporting from states to the CDC. Additionally, the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard is being considered in a variety of reporting and data collection scenarios including the CDC Outbreak Management System. Data Ingest and Access Control. Data ingest control is responsible for checking the integrity and authenticity of data feeds from the underlying information sources. Access control is responsible for granting and restricting user access to potentially sensitive data. Data ingest and access control is particularly important in IDI applications because of obvious data confidentiality concerns and data sharing requirements imposed by data contributors. Although ingest and access control issues are common in many application domains, IDI poses some unique considerations and requirements. In most other applications, a user is either granted or denied access to a particular information item. In IDI applications, however, user access privilege is often not binary. For instance, a local public health official has full access to data collected from his or her jurisdiction but typically does not have the same access to data from neighboring jurisdictions. However, it does not necessarily mean that this official has no access at all to such data from neighboring jurisdictions. Often he or she can be granted access to such data in some aggregated form (e.g., monthly or county-level statistics). Such granularity-based data access requirements warrant special treatment when designing an IDI system.",

Early knowledge of a disease outbreak plays an important reporting of notifiable diseases is often slow and incomplete, a new breed of public health surveillance systems has the potential to significantly speed up detection of disease outbreaks. These new, computer-based surveillance systems offer valuable and timely information to hospitals as well as to state, local, and federal health officials (Pavlin 2003; Bravata, McDonald et al. 2004; Dembek, Carley et al. 2005; Yan, Zeng et al. 2006 ). These systems are capable of real-time or near real-time detection of serious illnesses and potential bioterrorism agent exposures, allowing for a rapid public health response (Mandl, Overhage et al. 2004 ). This public health surveillance approach is generally called syndromic surveillance, an ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of \"syndrome\"-specific data for early detection of public health aberrations. role in improving response effectiveness. While traditional disease surveillance often relies on time-consuming laboratory diagnosis and the In the literature, the discussion of syndromic surveillance systems usually falls under the following functional areas: 1) data sources and acquisition, 2) syndrome classification, 3) anomaly detection, and 4) data visualization and data access. The surveillance data are first collected from the data providers to a centralized data repository where the raw data are categorized into syndrome categories to indicate certain disease threats. Anomaly detection employing time and space data analysis algorithms characterizes the syndromic data to detect the anomalies (for example, the surge of counts of clinic visits aggregated by days, or anomalous spatial clusters of medical records aggregated by ZIP codes). The data visualization and data access module is used to facilitate case investigations and support data exploration and summarization in a visual environment. The rest of this section is dedicated to these four functional areas, respectively.",

Syndrome classification is thus one of the first and most important steps in syndromic data processing.

This method can identify hotspots with irregular shapes in an online context Another challenging issue for real time outbreak detection is that the surveillance algorithms rely on historic datasets that span a considerable length of time against which to measure the anomaly of observed data. Few methods demonstrate reliable detection capability with short-term baseline data. Measurements on timeliness, specificity, and sensitivity of the detection algorithms have been reported; however, existing evaluation studies are quite limited, as they are either reliable only for one specific disease (Kleinman and Abrams 2006) or are biased by simulation settings as very few bioterrorism attacks for real testing are available.",

The BioPortal project was initiated in 2003 by the University of Arizona and its collaborators in the New York State Department of Health and the California Department of Health Services under the guidance of a federal inter-agency working group named the Infectious Disease Informatics Working Committee. Since then, its partner base has expanded to include the USGS, University of California, Davis, University of Utah, the Arizona Department of Health Services, Kansas State University, and the National Taiwan University. BioPortal provides distributed, cross-jurisdictional access to datasets concerning several major infectious diseases, including Botulism, West Nile virus, foot-and-mouth disease, livestock syndromes, and chief complaints (both in English and Chinese). It features advanced spatialtemporal data analysis methods and visualization capabilities. Figure 26 -2 shows its system architecture. BioPortal supports syndromic surveillance of epidemiological data and free-text chief complaints. It also supports analysis and visualization of lab-generated gene sequence information. Figure 26 -3 illustrates how epidemiological and genetic data analyses are integrated from a systems perspective.",

One method recently developed uses a concept ontology derived from the UMLS (Lu, Zeng et al. 2006) . For each chief complaint (CC), the method first standardizes the CC into one or more medical concepts in the UMLS. These concepts are then mapped into exist-ing symptom groups using a set of rules constructed from a symptom grouping table. For symptoms not in the table, a Weighted Semantic Similarity Score algorithm, which measures the semantic similarity between the target symptoms and existing symptom groups, is used to determine the best symptom group for the target symptom. The ontology-enhanced CC classification method has also been extended to handle CCs in Chinese. BioPortal supports outbreak detection based on spatial-temporal clustering analysis, also known as hotspot analysis, to identify unusual spatial and temporal clusters of disease events. BioPortal supports various scan statisticbased methods through the SaTScan binary, which has been widely used in public health; the Nearest Neighbor Hierarchical Clustering method initially developed for crime analysis; and two new artificial intelligence clusteringbased methods (Risk-Adjusted Support Vector Clustering, and Prospective Support Vector Clustering) developed in-house, which can support detection of areas with irregular shapes .",

Figure 26 -4 illustrates how these three views can be used to explore an infectious disease dataset. The GIS view displays cases and sightings on a map. The user can select multiple datasets to be shown on the map in different layers using the checkboxes (e.g., disease cases, natural land features, and land-use elements). Through the periodic view the user can identify periodic temporal patterns (e.g., which months or weeks have an unusually high number of cases). The unit of time for aggregation can also be set as days or hours. The timeline view provides a timeline along with a hierarchical display of the data elements, organized as a tree. A new gene sequence-based phylogenetic tree visualizer (not shown in Figure 26 -4) has been recently added to the STV interface for diseases with quick mutation rates such as the foot-and-mouth disease. This allows BioPortal users to explore epidemiological and sequence data concurrently. Data confidentiality, security, and access control are among the key research and development issues for the BioPortal project. A role-based access control mechanism is implemented based on data confidentiality and user access privileges. The project has also developed a consortium type of data sharing Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) to reduce the barrier of sharing information among data contributors including local and state public health agencies.",
