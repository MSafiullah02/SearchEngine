For the next 20 years, the number of practicing psychologists remained small, and service settings were highly varied\u2013university lab/clinics, public clinics/hospitals, and a few in independent practice. The first major change in the magnitude, location, and nature of practice occurred during 1914\u20131918 with World War I and the need to evaluate new recruits for potential military service, particularly with the deployment of the Army Alpha and Beta tests. Clinical psychology and clinical practice experienced a big growth in psychological testing (particularly IQ testing). Growth and range of practice in the 20 years after the war were modest, but not insignificant (VandenBos, Cummings, & DeLeon, 1992).",

In 1967, Massachusetts General Hospital established an in-house medical station at Logan International Airport in Boston to provide health care for travelers via combined microwave audio and video links. This more or less coincided with NASA\u2019s foray into telehealth through the use of physiologic monitors for astronauts (Nesbitt, 2012).

One of those articles was a survey of 596 practicing psychologists about the nature and extent of psychologists\u2019 involvement in telepsychology (VandenBos & Williams, 2000), reporting that only 2% had ever used internet or satellite technology to deliver health care. In 2019, a survey of 1,791 psychologists averaging 26 years of experience found that the vast majority of psychologists had still never used telepsychology (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020).",

Telepsychology practice went from 29% of users employing online platforms for a portion of their practice to over 80% conducting almost all their practice online. This is an amazing practice transformation that occurred in just 1\u20132 weeks. This rapid shift occurred because the technology was available, and some processes and procedures were already in place for telepsychology, including online practice guidelines (Joint Task Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists, 2013). Additionally, most psychologists had some level of exposure to telepsychology practice even if they were not doing it regularly.",

Obviously, nonsalaried psychologists in independent practice are most affected by this decline, but those in institutional settings may also feel job insecurity in that productivity measures such as relative value units are likely to decrease. The medium and long-term consequences of this caseload reduction are not yet apparent, but we believe that dues-driven psychological organizations may see a reduction in their overall memberships, and organizations that provide services to psychologists, such as meetings and conventions, may also experience reduced attendance numbers.",

From the inception of service delivery to evaluation of outcomes of assessment or psychotherapy conducted via telepsychology, fundamental practical and risk-management differences exist. Psychologists may be unaware that a separate informed consent form is required when transitioning from in-person to telepsychology services. An explicit safety plan including emergency contacts and resources at the patient\u2019s location is likewise required, as are protocols to ensure patient privacy when receiving at-home psychological services (Alvord, 2020).",

We did not query specifically as to BAAs associated with users\u2019 platforms.

In such times, consultation and sound clinical judgment based on the needs of the individual patient may become the best sources of guidance for the practitioner.

Much depends on state and federal laws and regulations as well as reimbursement decisions made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private third-party payers. Ultimately, however, patient and provider acceptance will determine the extent to which distance service provision becomes a more widespread component of the treatment repertoire. It is our belief that, by availing themselves of extant and developing resources such as those provided by the National Register, The Trust, and other organizations, psychologists will become sufficiently comfortable with this medium to create lasting change, and that both practitioners and patients will benefit from expanded access to mental health services.",
