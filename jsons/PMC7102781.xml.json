Several samples can be obtained from the respiratory system that can be used for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection. These include tracheal aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum. Tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage samples (lower respiratory samples) yielded significantly higher viral copies than nasopharyngeal and sputum samples [1]. Analyzing whole blood and plasma also yielded positive viral genome [2]. The kinetics of viral presence in blood is not well understood. The observation of lymphopenia in severe cases and the presence of the virus receptor on na\u00efve and memory T lymphocytes [3] warrant the study of viral replication inside T lymphocytes.",
