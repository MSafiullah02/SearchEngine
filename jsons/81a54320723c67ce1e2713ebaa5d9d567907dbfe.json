Based on the outcome seen in some in vitro studies, numerous clinical studies were launched but only few of these which were published, presented relevant results and highlighted the efficacy of different treatment modalities [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Additionally, a lot of controversial findings are noticed among the researches. A study conducted by Gautret et al. has supported that hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing viral load [8] , while there are a few studies which disagree with this [7] . Some research studies have even reported harmful effects of hydroxychloroquine [10, 16] . Moreover, most of the published studies had small sample size [7] [8] [9] 13] or conducted a non-randomized clinical trial (non-RCT), which are major limitations in deriving a sound outcome [8, 10-12, 14, 15] . Many review articles which have discussed the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients showed limitation as they included only few relevant studies, significant Chinese studies were omitted and analysis of treatment effects was not quantified while formulating the results [17] [18] [19] . Recently, two systematic review with meta-analysis were published which had small sample size [20] and there was no clear clarity with regard to the effects of using hydroxychloroquine alone, or when combined with azithromycin, for the treatment of COVID-19 [21] . These systematic review did not include any national trials All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In view of severe outbreak of COVID-19 and rapid increase of studies being conducted, it is crucial to systematically evaluate the relevant studies in a rigorous manner.

One Chinese trial was described as randomized, although the method of randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of assessors during outcome evaluation was not mentioned [7] whereas another randomized control trial properly described the method of randomization and double-blinding [9] .

Reports have indicated that the average age of COVID-19 patients was about 50 years, and the percentage distribution among male and female was nearly equal [30] [31] [32] Since the mortality risk for COVID-19 varies by age, the current evidence suggests that older people are at a higher risk of getting affected from COVID-19 than younger ones [33, 34] and it might be related to multiple comorbidities commonly seen in older people [35] .

Therefore, as there are limited related RCTs in the literature at present, only those were included in our study. In the lack of experimental random allocation to the intervention, the effects of the hydroxychloroquine might be overestimated. Furthermore, the two single-center RCTs which were conducted in China had some limitations as it included small sample size, did not conduct an international trial, and only limited data was available regarding the viral load. In our present study, bias might be present since little information was provided on demographic data, comorbidity, severity of disease, and the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin such as QT prolongation. In addition, we have not performed a dose-response meta-analysis, due to the lack of original data. Finally, the limited number of available studies which were included, made it unworkable to evaluate the true effect of hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, the present results should be interpreted cautiously, and further large, prospective RCTs needs to be conducted in a methodologically rigorous manner.",

These results were based on the outcome reported in only two trials which had their own limitations such as small sample size (66 patients), short observation period (6-7 days) and short duration of drug treatment (5-10 days)[7,8]. Another small case series which included more severely infected COVID-19 patients reported an unfavorable viral elimination with the combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin[13]. However, Gautret et al.conducted a similar study which included 80 patients and reported that hydroxychloroquine when coadministered with azithromycin displayed a prompt reduction in viral load, with nearly 80-90% negative cases reported at Day7-8 [12]. Another cohort study which took place in France, included 1061 new COVID-19 patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
