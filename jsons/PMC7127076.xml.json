            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1), also known as dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is well studied in the animal kingdom. The mammalian ACE is best known for its role in the renin\u2013angiotensin system, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure homeostasis (Bernstein et al., 2013). Angiotensin I is converted to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II by ACE through the cleavage of a C-terminal dipeptide of angiotensin I. Apart from this, ACE takes part in thermoregulation (Schwimmer et al., 2004), hematopoiesis (Hubert et al., 2006), and immune responses (Bernstein et al., 2013). The mammalian ACE has two distinct isoforms, i.e., a double-domain somatic form and a single-domain testicular form (Bernstein et al., 2013).",

Insect ACE only has one isoform, which resembles the testicular form of the mammalian ACE (Lemeire et al., 2008). The biological functions of ACEs in insects are diversified. They are involved in larval growth and development (Isaac et al., 2007), metabolic inactivation and biosynthesis of neuropeptides (Isaac et al., 2009), digestion (Lemeire et al., 2008), regulation of male and female fecundity (Isaac et al., 1999; Ekbote et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2018), modulation of insect-plant interactions as effector proteins (Wang et al., 2015), and immune response (Aguilar et al., 2005; Macours et al., 2003; Duressa and Huybrechts, 2016). Regarding the roles of ACE in the innate immune system of insects, upregulation of ACE transcripts was observed in defense against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not against fungal infection in Locusta migratoria and Anopheles gambiae (Aguilar et al., 2005; Macours et al., 2003; Duressa and Huybrechts, 2016).",

            "text": "\nRice stripe virus (RSV), a single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Tenuivirus, is one of the most destructive pathogens to rice and has caused serious rice yield loss in many East Asian countries (Toriyama, 1986). This virus is efficiently transmitted by the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus in a persistent-propagative manner (Falk and Tsai, 1998). The genome of RSV contains four RNA segments. RNA1 is negative-sense and encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The other three segments are ambisense and encode NS2, NSvc2 (putative membrane glycoprotein), NS3 (gene silencing suppressor), CP (nucleocapsid protein), SP (disease-specific protein), and NSvc4 (movement protein) (Cho et al., 2013). As a persistent-propagative plant virus, RSV has a limited replication level in the vector insect under the surveillance of the insect immune system, such as pattern recognition molecules, immune-responsive effectors, reactive oxygen species, and the Toll pathway (Zhao et al., 2016, 2019a). In addition to these well-known immune pathways, the ACE gene of L. striatellus (LsACE) was found to response; its transcript level was upregulated in viruliferous planthoppers (Zhang et al., 2010). However, whether this ACE gene plays an immune response function against RSV infection in the vector insect is unclear.",

            "text": "The immune function of LsACE in RSV infection of vector insects is different from that of the mammalian renin\u2013angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of various human viruses. The expression of LsACE is activated by RSV, and the increase in LsACE is not in favor of the viral infection, as shown by inhibited viral SP expression. Cytoplasmic viral inclusions comprise SP that directly interacts with the ribonucleoprotein particles of RSV; the knockdown of SP expression significantly limited the spread of RSV in the infected insects (Wu et al., 2014). In our study, overexpression of SP due to the knockdown of LsACE in planthoppers led to a more serious disease incidence in rice plants, suggesting a higher viral transmission efficiency from vector insects to host plants. Therefore, the immune function of LsACE may be embodied in blocking the RSV spread in vector insects. In contrast, the SARS coronavirus and avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9 share a common regulation on the mammalian renin\u2013angiotensin system, namely, the elevation of angiotensin II levels in parallel with reduced ACE2 and sometimes enhanced ACE activities (Kuba et al., 2005; W\u00f6sten-van Asperen et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014). The plasma level of angiotensin II is strongly correlated with the disease severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Angiotensin I is cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II and is further converted to angiotensin 1-7 by ACE2 (Imai et al., 2010). Therefore, these two enzymes have opposite functions in the mammalian renin\u2013angiotensin system. Activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin system in viral acute respiratory distress syndrome and in RSV-infected vector insects produces a different effect on viral infection. This is probably due to differences in the substrates that are catalyzed by the two enzymes in mammals and insects.",

            "text": "LsACE may have extensive protein interactions. As a member of the M2 metalloprotease family, ACE is usually involved in the digestion of small hormonal peptides and neuropeptides, such as leucokinin, locustatachykinin, and allatostatin in insects (Lamango et al., 1997). We identified 20 proteins that putatively interact with LsACE. Of these proteins, several were associated with immune and inflammatory reactions. Kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase 3 (EC 2.6.1.7), also known as kynurenine aminotransferase III, is a component of the kynurenine pathway that is partially involved in neuroactive and immunomodulatory metabolites (Asp et al., 2011). The DnaJ-like protein subfamily A member 2 is generally considered a potential target of the immune response in rheumatoid arthritis (Kotlarz et al., 2013). AMP deaminase 2 regulates the accumulation of extracellular ATP, which provokes pro-inflammation and immune effects in systemic lupus erythematosus (Guo et al., 2018). The RR1 cuticle protein 2 precursor may take part in viral transmission because the homologous cuticle proteins in the small brown planthopper (CPR1) and in the aphid Schizaphis graminum were found to be involved in the viral transmission process (Liu et al., 2015; Cilia et al., 2011). The macrophage migration inhibitory factor has a central role as a regulator of innate immune and inflammatory responses in human sepsis and other inflammatory diseases (Baumann et al., 2003). Considering that these proteins are not small peptides, we suggest that LsACE directly binds these proteins to affect their functions instead of cleaving them. One or more immune pathways could be targeted by LsACE.",
