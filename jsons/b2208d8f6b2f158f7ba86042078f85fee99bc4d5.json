            "text": "RNA silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionary conserved sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanism that plays an important role in cell differentiation and development. [1] [2] [3] In addition, RNAi serves as a defence mechanism against invading viruses and transposons. [4] [5] [6] RNA interference is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, which are processed in the cytoplasm by the dsRNAspecific endonuclease Dicer into 19-24 nucleotides (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or micro-RNAs (miRNAs). 7 These si/miRNAs are incorporated into the multiprotein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that guides the recognition and ultimately the cleavage or translational repression of complementary singlestranded RNA, such as messenger RNA or viral genomic RNA. [8] [9] [10] RNA interference has been employed to inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), dengue virus, poliovirus, influenza virus A, coronaviruses, herpesviruses and picornaviruses. 11 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions contain a single-stranded RNA genome that is a putative RNAi target. After entry into a host cell the genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into dsDNA, which is integrated into the host chromosomal DNA. Newly synthesized unspliced genome-length and spliced subgenomic viral RNAs are possible targets for RNAi in the cytoplasm. It has recently been reported that HIV-1 encodes a suppressor of RNAi, the Tat protein, indicating that HIV-1 replication is controlled by RNAi in human cells. 12 Due to its sequence specificity, RNAi is a potentially powerful and selective method for intracellular immunization against HIV-1 infection. RNA interference-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication has been accomplished by synthetic siRNAs in a transient manner [13] [14] [15] [16] and by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expression vectors in stably transfected cells. [17] [18] [19] Despite potent inhibition, the use of siRNA/shRNA as a therapeutic antiviral is limited, because of the rapid emergence of HIV-1 escape mutants. [19] [20] [21] Minor sequence changes in the target sequence, sometimes even a single point mutation, are sufficient to abrogate the inhibition of virus replication. Strategies to reduce the chance of viral escape include the simultaneous use of multiple siRNAs 22, 23 or the use of long-hairpin RNA (lhRNA, a single-hairpin molecule) or long dsRNA (two complementary molecules that form a duplex). 16, 24 Another possibility is the use of miRNA-based approaches, which do not require perfect sequence complementarity. 25, 26 Several reports describe efficient RNAi induction by lhRNA and long dsRNA as in vitro generated transcripts that are transfected into cells or as gene constructs that produce the transcripts intracellularly. Transfection of pre-implantation mouse embryo cells, undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and embryonic carcinoma cells with in vitro synthesized long dsRNA confers specific gene silencing. 27, 28 However, exposure of non-embryonic mammalian cells to dsRNAs longer than 30 basepairs (bp) leads to rapid induction of a specific set of cytokines, including the class I interferons (IFNs). 29 During natural virus infections, the IFN response is activated by virusproduced dsRNAs, and acts as an innate defense mechanism. Viruses counter this response by encoding IFN antagonists, which are also responsible for the fact that antiviral IFN therapy is often not successful. 30, 31 So far, virus-encoded RNAi suppressor factors, like the HIV-1 Tat protein, do not appear to be able to suppress induced antiviral RNAi. Strong induction of RNAi by intracellular expression of virus-specific dsRNAs is likely to outcompete the inhibiting effects of RNAi suppressors.",

Cotransfection of pLAI with the pEF1atat, pEF1a-rev or pEF1a-nef1 vectors resulted in marginal inhibition of HIV-1 production in C33A and HEK 293T cells, and only the pEF1a-tat vector was inhibitory in Vero cells ( Figure 4a ). We also designed a control pEF1a-green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid that expresses a similar extended lhRNA against GFP mRNA. No inhibition of virus production was observed with the control pEF1a-GFP vector, thus providing additional evidence for the specificity of lhRNA-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 production. We previously demonstrated potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in T cells that stably express an shRNA targeted to viral nef gene sequences. 19 Therefore, if lhRNA inhibits HIV-1 potently, it should be at least as active as the sh-nef control. Unlike the results with in vitro synthesized nef2 dsRNA, either diced or not, all lhRNA constructs (tat, rev and nef1) were much less potent inhibitors than the control sh-nef construct, which produces the short hairpin from a polymerase III promoter. Because pEF1a-tat and pEF1a-nef1 were slightly more effective than pEF1a-rev in C33A and 293T cells, we focused on these lhRNAs in the subsequent experiments.",

The latter system seems ideally suited to restrict lhRNA expression to cells that are infected by HIV-1, thus providing a unique safety feature. Furthermore, we replaced the 46 bp spacer between the repeats by the 1000 bp EF-1a intron, since it has been shown that this improves the inhibitory potential of lhRNA-encoding DNA constructs. 50 The Tet-On system is based on the specific, highaffinity binding of the rtTA trans-activator to the tet operator (tetO) in the presence of dox, triggering transcription of downstream genes. This system has recently been used to express synthetic miRNA precursors in mouse or human genomes, following trans- Inhibition of HIV-1 by lhRNA P Konstantinova et al duction with retroviral or lentiviral vectors. 51 Vector pLAI was cotransfected with p7tetO-tat or p7tetO-nef1 ( Figure 3 ). We also included pCMV-rtTA and the control pRL, and dox was added 4 h later. p7tetO-tat or p7tetO-nef1 conferred no or very poor inhibition of HIV-1 as compared to the sh-nef control (Figure 4b ). The potency of the lhRNAs was not increased by varying the ratio of lhRNA-expression vector to pCMV-rtTA or the dox concentration. Moreover, a non-specific decrease of RL expression was observed at higher pCMV-rtTA concentrations, which is probably due to promoter squelching (results not shown).",

In order to increase the efficacy of the lhRNA molecules, we cloned the HIV-1 leader sequence (C) between the LTR and nef1 in pLTRC-nef1 ( Figure 3 ). Control plasmid pLTRasC-nef1 was made with the C element inserted in antisense orientation. Previously, we reported that sequences from the 5 0 untranslated leader of the HIV-1 genome, such as the RNA dimerization signal, can be used to inhibit HIV expression in trans. 53 We presumed that C should bring the antiviral RNA along viral pathways, conferring a stronger inhibitory effect. Indeed, in HEK 293T cells transfected with pLAI and pLTRC-nef1, HIV-1 production was almost completely inhibited ( Figure 5a ). The level of inhibition conferred by pLTRC-nef1 is comparable to that of the positive control sh-nef. Inhibition is specific and not due to a more general cell toxicity problem because no significant decrease in RL expression was observed (results not shown). Control plasmid pLTRasC-nef1 was much less effective in inhibiting HIV-1 production, with a potency comparable to that of the original pLTR-nef1 construct. Plasmid pLTRC, in which the nef1 sequence has been deleted, failed to inhibit HIV-1 production (Figure 5b ). This result indicates that the presence of the C element enhances lh-nef1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1, but the presence of the nef1 sequence is essential for the potent effect of pLTRC-nef1.",

Because pLAI gene expression is strongly inhibited by pLTRC-nef1, a negative feedback loop may have been established, which leads to an underestimation of the inhibitory potential of pLTRC-nef1. We therefore added a Tatexpression plasmid (pcDNA3-Tat) in trans to secure pLTRC-nef1 expression. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with 100 ng pLAI and 10-100 ng pLTRC-nef1 with or without pcDNA3-Tat.

The 1 kb EF1a intron is positioned downstream of the EF1a promoter. A schematic representation of the final hairpin structures is shown on the right. In pEF1a constructs, the two complementary RNA strands are separated by a 46 nt loop. In the p7tetO and pLTR constructs, the complementary sequences are separated by a 1 kb spacer that contains splice donor and acceptor sites.

            "text": "The use of synthetic siRNAs or shRNA-expression plasmids as inducers of RNAi-based therapy against HIV-1 faces the major obstacle of the emergence of virus escape variants. Similar to the combined use of antivirals in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), one could design an RNAi therapy with extended lhRNA/ dsRNA. Endogenous expression of two long complementary RNAs, with the potential to form an extended dsRNA duplex, leads to specific suppression of gene expression in mammalian cells. 32, 34, 35, 37 Interestingly, fulllength dsRNAs could not be detected, suggesting that Inhibition of HIV-1 by lhRNA P Konstantinova et al processing by Dicer precludes their accumulation in the cytoplasm. Long dsRNAs are indeed processed in vitro by the RNAi machinery into multiple active siRNAs. 55, 56 Several lines of evidence show that lhRNAs induce gene silencing by the RNAi mechanism. Inhibition of Dicer abrogated the gene silencing induced by lhRNA against GFP, indicating that silencing was mediated by RNAi. 32 These results suggest that long dsRNA is well tolerated in mammalian cells, most likely because it is processed rapidly by the RNAi machinery. It is also relevant to mention that mammalian cells may naturally produce dsRNA derived from repetitive and transposable elements. 57, 58 A recently performed bioinformatics study revealed the presence of at least 4520 full-length transcripts, which form sense-antisense gene pairs in the human genome. 59 We designed a set of anti-HIV-1 lhRNA/dsRNAexpression constructs and compared their ability to inhibit virus production with a very potent shRNAbased inhibitor that we described previously. 19 Ideally, a single lhRNA should provide more potent inhibition of HIV than an shRNA. An additional advantage of lhRNA is that it does not require predetermination of optimal shRNAs and HIV-1 target sequences because multiple effective siRNAs will be produced. A potential disadvantage of the use of lhRNA as therapeutic is that the multiple siRNAs are more likely to cause off-target effects. (a) pT7-luc (100 ng) construct was cotransfected in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with or without 30 ng pT7-pol. At 2 days after transfection, cells were lysed and the expression of firefly luciferase was measured. (b) pT7-nef2 (100 ng) and pT7sh-nef vectors were linearized 3 0 of the T7 termination signal with XbaI and BamHI, respectively, and cotransfected with 100 ng pLAI, 30 ng pT7-pol and 2.5 ng pRL in HEK 293T cells. Two separate complementary RNA chains, potentially forming dsRNA, are transcribed in the cell from convergent T7 promoters. Equal amounts of a pH1sh-nef expression vector and the empty vector were added as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cotransfections were also performed without pT7-pol to check for non-specific effects of the T7 plasmids. Virus production was determined as described in the legend to Figure 2 . Standard error bars represent the means of four independent experiments. Cells were lysed 2 days after transfection to measure Renilla luciferase. (c) Sequence-specific inhibition of the pGL3-Nef reporter, containing the 250-nucleotide (nt) nef2 target sequence downstream of the luciferase coding domain, by pT7-nef2. HEK 239T cells were cotransfected with 100 ng of pGL3-Nef, 100 ng pT7-nef2, 30 ng pT7-pol and 2.5 ng pRL. pH1sh-nef (10 ng) expression vector and the empty vector were added as positive and negative controls, respectively. (d) Titration of T7 polymerase. pLAI (100 ng) was cotransfected with increasing amounts (0-3-10-30-100 ng) of pT7-pol and 100 ng pT7-nef2 or pT7sh-nef.",

The most active constructs either link the lhRNA to viral RNA sequences (C) or express the long dsRNA directly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that translocation of dsRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is a crucial step for these molecules to enter the cytoplasmic RNAi pathway. It is widely accepted that RNAi is a cytoplasmic process, as most protein components of the RNAi pathway, including Argonaute 2, TRBP and Dicer, assemble and function in the cytoplasm. 54, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] Putative problems in nuclear export of lhRNA may thus hamper its inhibitory activity. Modification of the lhRNA by addition of the HIV-1 leader sequence (C) or direct cytoplasmic expression of long dsRNA by the T7 polymerase created potent inhibitors. The viral C sequence may provide the transcript with a non-self signature and thereby boost RNAi. It has previously been suggested that the inhibitory effect of C-containing transcripts is sequence-specific, possibly due to premature formation of RNA dimers, 53 but the exact mechanism of inhibition remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "RNA interference-based gene therapy against HIV-1 seems to be a viable option, either as mono-therapy or combined with traditional drug therapy. 22, 68 The outgrowth of RNAi-resistant virus mutants presents a major obstacle for all sequence-specific inhibitory strategies. The simultaneous targeting of multiple conserved targets by lhRNA may confer increased robustness to future RNAi therapies. We will focus on optimization of the DNA constructs encoding HIV-1-specific lhRNAs, for example, the type of promoter used and the structure of the lhRNA. We will also test stable expression of these constructs in HIV-susceptible cells. These cell lines will be extensively tested for the emergence of RNAi-resistant virus variants. Figure 7 In vivo RNA expression from long-hairpin RNA (lhRNA) constructs. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 500 ng of the indicated lhRNA/double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000. Constructs pLTR-nef1 and pLTRC-nef1 were cotransfected with 30 ng pTat. Construct pT7-nef2 was cotransfected with 100 ng pT7-pol. The pUC19 plasmid and poly (I:C) were used as negative controls and pT7-nef2 plasmid DNA was used as a positive control. Total RNA was isolated from the cells 48 h after transfection. The nef expression level was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers Nef-B/X and antiU3-att, which create a 110 basepairs (bp) amplification product. b-Actin mRNA expression was analyzed as an internal control. pT7-nef2 RT\u00c0 is a control reaction without RT step. 293T cells (1.5 \u00c2 10 5 ) were cotransfected with pLAI and the indicated lhRNA/double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000. Construct pT7-nef2 was cotransfected with pT7-pol. Renilla luciferase (pRL) was used as an internal control. The pUC19 plasmid was used as a negative control. In vitro transcribed ds-nef2 RNA and poly (I:C) act as positive controls for IFN-b induction. Two separate transfections were performed, which were processed for either IFN-b mRNA expression or renilla measurement. No significant differences in Renilla expression were measured, except for the toxic treatment with ds-nef2 RNA and poly(I:C) (results not shown). In addition, we measured CA-p24 in the supernatant, which showed the inhibition characteristics described earlier. Total RNA was isolated from the cells 24 h after transfection. The IFN-b expression level was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). b-Actin mRNA expression was analyzed as an internal control.
