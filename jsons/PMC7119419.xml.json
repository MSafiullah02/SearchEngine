Although only about 10% of infected persons transmitted the virus to household members, a large percentage of household members were infected. These observations suggest that there is a large variability in infectivity among SARS patients, with a small proportion appearing to be more infectious and more likely to transmit the disease to close contacts than others. This might be related to the difference in viral load among different patients. Identification of highly infectious SARS patients will facilitate infection control.",

Indeed, more than a quarter of patients had infected their household members compared with 10% of health care workers infected before implementation of the protective equipment rule. This might be because many patients were elderly and required assistance for daily activities from household members. Moreover, clinical presentation tends to be atypical in elderly SARS patients (5), who often do not have the typical symptoms of high fever, chills, and rigors. The atypical presentation may delay hospitalization and increase the risk of transmission to household members.",

Once these workers developed symptoms, they would seek medical attention and be admitted early, which would reduce their contact with household members.",
