            "text": "Travel medicine is based on the concept of risk reduction. Travelers' risk perception about travel-related infectious diseases is considered a major component of their response to pre-travel advice [1], [2]. Travelers' acceptance of vaccination and observance of malaria prophylaxis measures are partly dependent on their perception of the frequency of the threat and its severity and of their own susceptibility to the threat. Consequently, studies specifically addressing risk perception in travelers have been conducted so that the clinician can provide advice that is both meaningful as well as effective in ensuring safe travel [3]. However, the perception of risk by travelers as well as by travel medicine experts is highly subjective, and although this subjectivity suffuses the field of travel medicine, it has rarely been discussed [4] and there has been little formal study on the subject of risk (i.e., risk research) in the context of travel medicine [5].",

Of the 35 KAP surveys, 34 used a cross-sectional design with self-administered questionnaires (n = 26) [6], [8], [9], [10], [13], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [26], [29], [30], [31], [33], [35], [36], [37], [39], [40], [41], [43], [44], [45], four of which were web-based [13], [18], [19], [21], or face-to-face questionnaires (n = 7) [7], [11], [14], [24], [28], [32], [38]. One KAP survey was a prospective cohort survey using face-to-face and telephone questionnaires [34]. Only four studies used a methodology distinct from KAP surveys. One cross-sectional study used a combination of questionnaires and a visual psychometric measuring instrument called the \u2018pictorial representation of illness and self-measure\u2019 or PRISM [12]. One cross-sectional study used a self-representation model (SRM) method [27]. Two cross-sectional studies measured psychosocial factors [25], [42].",

            "text": "In this review paper about the methodology used in studies addressing the risk perception of travelers about infectious diseases, we show that almost all have been conducted using the KAP method. In 2002\u20132003, the European Travel Health Advisory Board (ETHAB) conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional study to determine the KAP for travel health matters in passengers traveling to developing countries [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. The questionnaire included demographic and travel data, source of travel advice, perceived risk of specific infectious diseases, perception and status of vaccinations, perception and practice of malaria prophylaxis. This questionnaire (or adapted versions) has been used in many studies in different populations of travelers to date. With this method, the studies were able to quantitatively define three components: travelers' actual knowledge of a given disease (symptoms, transmission, preventive measures, etc.), their attitudes (negative, positive, or neutral) toward preventive measures or in terms of intended risk taking/avoidance behavior, and their practices (protection rate). As is typically the case for the KAP method [46], measurements were obtained using either self-report questionnaires or structured interviews. A large amount of descriptive data can be collected from a single survey, revealing quantitative as well as qualitative information [47]. Valuable information was obtained from the above KAP surveys showing an overall lack of knowledge among travelers about the most frequent travel-associated infections and associated preventive measures. These findings have led researchers to outline the need for efficient communication strategies in order to improve travelers' risk knowledge and their adherence to safety measures [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [19], [20], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [45]. Although the KAP method has been widely advocated, it is not without limitations. One shortcoming is that this methodological approach is mainly descriptive. Estimates in percentages are typically provided for knowledge, attitudes, and practices separately, but the interrelationships between these three components are hardly examined. However, knowing whether and how safety behaviors can be predicted by risk knowledge and attitudes is important information. Descriptive statistics alone can be misleading. This is the case in the KAP studies reviewed here, where high percentages of knowledge have been found to coexist with either high [6] or low [18], [22], [38], [40] percentages of protective behavior, while other studies reported low percentages in both knowledge and protective behavior [17], [19], [20], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [45]. The use of multivariate statistical analyses is thus necessary to assess the respective and real contribution of each key variable. In addition, repeated descriptions of how poor the risk knowledge of travelers is do not inform about efficient measures likely to promote healthy behavior. Travel medicine would benefit at present from experimental studies designed to test different interventions for improving adherence to safety behaviors [48].",

            "text": "Another limitation of the KAP method is that it overlooks psychosocial variables that have proven to be influential in health related behaviors. For example, the health belief model [49], [50] states that the adoption of safety behaviors will not only depend on individuals' perceptions of the likelihood and seriousness of the disease (often measured with the KAP method), but also on their perceived balance between benefits and costs of preventive measures. In line with this, a meta-analysis of 18 studies [51] showed that low perceived barriers and high perceived benefits were consistently the strongest predictors of various healthy behaviors such as tuberculosis screening, quitting smoking, taking medication, dental care, condom use, or attending programs. The theory of planned behavior [52], [53] also proposes that subjective norms (perceived social pressure from important others like friends, family, general and specialized practitioners) and perceived personal control over the behavior are direct predictors of intentions to engage in healthy behavior, which in turn predict behavior. Findings provided support for this model across various health-related behavior categories such as addictive behaviors, automobile-related behavior, clinical and screening behavior, eating behavior, and safe sex behaviors [54], [55], [56]. At least one other psychosocial factor is worth mentioning that can help understand why low adherence to safety behaviors can be observed despite high risk knowledge: positive illusions. Social and cognitive psychology has demonstrated that individuals tend to exhibit unrealistically positive self-evaluations [57], which can make them overconfident in their decisions and unrealistically optimistic. Of particular interest here, unrealistic optimism (the tendency to think that bad events are more likely to happen to others than to oneself) [58], [59] has been documented in over a thousand studies and for various undesirable events such as diseases and natural disasters [60]. Findings show that unrealistic optimism leads to overestimating the ability to quit smoking [61], neglecting risk information [62], and hindering precautionary behaviors [63] to the point that unrealistic optimism has been found to be positively associated with higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis [64]. In sum, the perceived costs and benefits of safety behaviors, social pressure, personal behavioral control, and unrealistic optimism are key variables that should receive attention in travel medicine, in order to provide a fairer picture of travelers' risk perception about infectious diseases and their likelihood to adopt safety behaviors (See Table 2\n).",

            "text": "Finally, the KAP method is also vulnerable to the limitations of self-reporting, with participants being either unwilling or unable to report their true feelings, intentions, and behaviors [65]. Some individuals may indeed report their intention to use chemoprophylaxis for social desirability purposes. Others may honestly report their intention to adopt healthy behaviors while finally failing to adopt them for reasons beyond their awareness. Implicit measurements of attitudes such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) [66] have been proposed to complement the information provided by self-reports. The IAT is a 10-min computer-based task that assesses the degree to which people associate some target categories (e.g., \u201csmoking, \u201d \u201cnot smoking\u201d) with specific attributes (e.g., \u201cpositive, \u201d \u201cnegative\u201d). The relative strength of these associations (as indexed by reaction times) reflects individuals' automatic or implicit attitudes. For instance, an IAT designed to assess individual risk propensity uses the categories \u201cme\u201d and \u201cnot me\u201d and attributes \u201crisky\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d [67]. Individuals with high risk propensity are typically quicker to associate \u201cme\u201d with \u201crisky\u201d than \u201cme\u201d with \u201csecure, \u201d and these implicit attitudes predict higher risk-taking behavior. Several IATs have been developed in the health domain to measure implicit attitudes towards addiction (e.g., alcohol, smoking, drug abuse), diet (tendency to a eat high fat diet), or suicidal ideation/attempt, and these implicit attitudes have proved significant predictors of risky behaviors above and beyond the effects of explicit attitudes [68], [69], [70]. Travel medicine could benefit from such implicit measurements. New IATs adapted to travelers and infectious disease need to be developed and evaluated. They might help identify travelers likely to engage in risky behaviors, and thus provide a more appropriate pre-travel consultation.",
