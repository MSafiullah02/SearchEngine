TGE can affect pigs of all ages, but the disease severity and mortality rate are high in piglets under 2 weeks of age. The causative agent is TGE virus (TGEV), a coronavirus that primarily infects and replicates in the epithelial cells of pig intestines. Affected animals shed the virus in their feces . The disease transmission occurs primarily via fecal-oral route [ 2 ] . During an outbreak, rapid detection of TGEV in feces is very useful for implementing the disease management practices in a timely manner. Any TGEV-specifi c diagnostic assay must be able to differentiate it from porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a natural mutant of TGEV with truncated spike protein and altered cell tropism towards respiratory epithelial cells [ 3 ] . PRCV mostly causes mild or subclinical respiratory disease. However, in some PRCV-infected pigs, the virus can be shed in the feces [ 4 ] . Realtime PCR -based assays are well suited for rapid, specifi c, and sensitive detection of viruses such as TGEV. The real-time RT-PCR assay described here is based on amplifi cation of a conserved region of the spike protein gene of TGEV strains and detection of the amplifi ed products using a TaqMan probe [ 5 ] . The assay, along with the RNA extraction method described here, can be established in any molecular diagnostic laboratory for detection of TGEV in pig fecal samples [ 6 -8 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 93, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 463, "end": 468, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 839, "end": 844, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 979, "end": 984, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1301, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1477, "text": "[ 6 -8 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Preventing contamination of samples and reagents with nucleic acids and nucleases is critical to obtaining accurate and reproducible results with any PCR -based diagnostic assay.
