The worldwide spreading of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) represents a major problem encountered at an increasing frequency in ICU [2, 3]. Among ICU patients, between 5 and 25% are ESBL-E carriers [4\u20136]. Whereas a previous carriage is the major risk factor associated with VAP related to ESBL-E [7, 8], only 5\u201320% of the ESBL-E carriers will develop a VAP related to ESBL-E [9, 10]. With regard to the occurrence of ESBL-E-associated VAP, the negative predictive value of a ESBL-E digestive carriage is high, while its positive predictive value, i.e., the probability of having an ESBL-E infection in case of ESBL-E carriage, is less than 50% [9, 11\u201315].",

In case of community-acquired urinary tract infection, the involvement of ESBL-E might be predicted by the relative abundance (defined as the proportion of the concentration of ESBL-E vs. total concentration of Enterobacteriales in the feces) of ESBL-E carriage. Subsequently, the amount of ESBL-E in the digestive flora and the presence of an oropharyngeal colonization as compared to a rectal colonization may be associated with a higher risk of ESBL-E-associated VAP when GNB-VAP is diagnosed.",

            "text": "The relationship between rectal and oropharyngeal GNB colonization and VAP has not been fully addressed in the literature. In a monocenter study performed in patients receiving selective digestive decontamination [34], Frencken et al. showed that a rectal colonization predicted the respiratory tract colonization for both Enterobacterales and non-fermentative GNB. They also showed that both rectal and respiratory tract colonization with Enterobacterales predicted the involvement of these bacteria in the investigated ICU-acquired infections, including bacteremia. Another monocenter study found that the monitoring of both respiratory and rectal colonization increased the adequacy of antibiotic therapy of VAP and BSI due to Gram-negative bacteria (mainly P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.) [35]. More recently, in acutely ill patients who developed VAP caused by Enterobacterales species, a prospective observational case\u2013control study suggested that the causative pathogens gained access to the oropharynx early after the start of the mechanical ventilation and outgrew the commensal members of the microbiome [36]. The results called for assessing whether a specific pattern of the oropharyngeal microbiome could predict VAP. Carbonne et al. assessed the presence of ESBL-E in respiratory samples collected in ESBL-E-positive rectal carriers, irrespective of any clinical symptoms. Respiratory samples were significantly more frequently positive when the sample was collected after an ICU stay longer than 5 days [13]. A meta-analysis [37] showed that respiratory tract colonization with multi-drug-resistant bacteria including Enterobacterales predicted the risk of subsequent VAP. The prediction was better when surveillance tracheal cultures were systematically performed at least twice a week.",

Of note, in this study, we did not try to demonstrate that this semi-quantitative assessment was linked to ESBL-E-relative abundance. Some studies performed in critically ill patients identified a relationship between the relative abundance in the stool of enterococci [39], ESBL-E [40] and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales [41], and subsequent infections due to these organisms. Indeed, the amount and the proportion of multi-drug-resistant GNB in the digestive microbiota are linked to the bacterial translocation in immunocompromised patients [42].

First, the study was performed in one unit without confirmatory data on other independent samples and its results may not be extrapolated to other ICUs.

Considering the poor link between rectal colonization and early-onset ICU-acquired infections [12] or positive respiratory samples [13] in previous studies, we consider that our results should not be generalized to early onset infections without further validation. Finally, the link between ESBL-E VAP and ESBL-E digestive carriage might be different from ESBL-E. coli and other Enterobacterales producers of ESBL. However, our result suggested that the quantification of the digestive carriage is a more important factor than the nature of the Enterobacterales species to predict ESBL-E VAP (Table 3, Model 3).",
