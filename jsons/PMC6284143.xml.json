Even though ED providers try to triage patients according to their clinical needs while managing scarce resources, these activities are often overwhelmed by the complexity and large volume of data. Emergency physicians are required to treat multiple patients while maintaining situational awareness of the ED surroundings [1]. This task is very challenging because it requires acquisition, processing, integration, and archiving of large data at multiple levels [2]. Thus, physicians frequently feel like they are losing control over the ED, which aggravates burnout and affects performance [3,4].",

While ED overcrowding remains a major health care issue, it significantly and adversely affects quality of care by influencing major quality factors, such as timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and patient-centeredness, resulting in increased mortality and morbidity [5,8-10]. Multiple studies have suggested the use of system engineering and science to improve ED performance, streamline the process, and improve the throughput [11-13]. However, a strategic approach to identify process delays and supply-demand mismatch using traditional hospital information systems (HISs) is not feasible. It is important to monitor and manage the ED as a whole.",
