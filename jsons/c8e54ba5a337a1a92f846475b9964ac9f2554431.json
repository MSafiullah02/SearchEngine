The study done by Liang Y et al, 2020 tried to see the relation between age and depressive symptoms. Though medical staff at younger age (<30 years) had higher self-rated depression scores than those with older age (30 years), the difference wasn't statistically significant. Cai et al., 2020 also suggested that age-group studied can variedly influence the subject matter of worry. Medical staff aged 31 -40 years were more worried about infecting their families whereas in staff>50 years of age patient's death caused more stress. In staff aged 41-50 years, factors like worry regarding their safety were also important. Older staff reported increased stress due to exhaustion due to prolonged work hours and lack of personal protective equipment. Irrespective of the age, the safety of colleagues and the lack of treatment for COVID-19 were perceived as factors that induced stress in all medical staff. . Also, the same study showed that nurses compared to doctors had more anxiety, depression, and anxiety. Cai et al., 2020 also reported that nurses felt more anxious and nervous compared to other professionals.",

Safety of family had the highest role in reducing stress along with corrective guidance, effective safeguards for the prevention of disease and positive attitude from their colleagues (more in female staff). Kang et al., 2020 reported that the degree of contact with confirmed or suspected cases and access to psychological materials/ resources is related to the extent of mental health disturbances. The degree of contact was directly related whereas the access to psychological help inversely related to the proportion of mental health disturbances. The subject's self-perceived physical health was poor in participants with higher mental health problems (Kang et al., 2020) . The only study from India included in the current review showed that certain positive motivational factors like supportive and proud family and colleagues, positive role models, validation and appreciation by peers/patients, positive caretaking experience, a sense of validation of existence, knowledge and acceptance of the possible inevitability of infection need to be strengthened to boost the morale of HP. As per this study, the negatives associated with patient care include multiple needs of the patients, stigma, need for clear management plans. One solution proposed by the HP interviewed to overcome the negatives include setting up of multidisciplinary teams and screening questionnaires. (Mohindra, et al., 2020) .",

Compared to the outbreak of SARS, widespread global connectivity and extensive media coverage are leading to the catastrophic reactions secondary to the outbreak (Tang et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2020) Research in the past had shown that epidemics can cause severe and variable psychological effects on people. In the general population, this can lead to the development of new psychiatric symptoms, worsening of pre-existing illnesses. Irrespective of getting exposed or being infected people can develop a fear of falling ill or dying, excessive worry/anxiety, helplessness, tendency to blame other people who are ill. The psychiatric illnesses that people develop include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, somatic symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, to delirium, psychosis and even suicidality (Hall et al., 2008; Muller, 2014; Sim et al, 2010) . As already pointed out, studies done in the past reported that HCW especially those working in emergency units, intensive care units, and infectious disease wards are at higher risk of developing adverse psychiatric impact (Naushad et al, 2019) . The current review also showed similar results that HCWs are at higher risk of developing adverse psychiatric outcomes. Findings were contradictory for front-line health workers with one study suggesting that they J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f are at higher risk than peers and other study finding no significant difference in stress with respect to the department.",

None of the studies included in the current reviewed assessed for PTSD in the HCW. The effect of social support and coping was shown by a systematic review conducted on the impact of a disaster on the mental health of HCW.

Certain initiatives were taken by the Chinese government for handling the psychological issues. It has issued emergency psychological crisis intervention guidelines for people infected with COVID-19 (National Health Commission of the People's republic of China, 2020). The Chinese government also implemented certain strategies to reduce the psychological burden on health workers. These include setting up of psychological intervention teams, use of shift duties, online platforms with medical advice. The psychological intervention teams consisted of 4 different teams including: the psychosocial response team, psychological intervention technical support team, psychological intervention medical team, psychological assistance hotline teams (Kang et al., 2020) . Similar suggestion to devise a psychological crisis intervention plan and development of psychological crisis intervention team was put forth by Rana et al., 2020 The studies included in the review have certain limitations altogether. All of them are crosssectional studies that were carried out from days-months. Except for 1 study which included 3 different geographical areas and 37 hospitals, all the other studies were conducted in only one province limiting the generalizability of the results within the country. 5 studies included in the review are from only one country (China), so the results may not be the same in many developing countries with a shortage of HCW. The sample size range varied between 78-1257, with 3 studies having sample size <550, larger sample size would better identify the extent of mental health problems.",

As per Cai et al., 2020 concerns for personal safety, concerns for their families, and concerns for patient mortality were the important stress-triggering factors in the medical staff. This study also looked into the reasons for continuing work during the outbreak like social and moral responsibility, recognition from hospital authorities, and anticipated additional financial compensation. Lai et al., 2020 have done a study from 34 hospitals in China, their results suggested that 3/4 ths of the 1257 health workers were in distress, half of the participants reported symptoms of depression and a third of them reported insomnia, 2/5 th of them reported anxiety symptoms. In the study conducted in India, the HP reported certain personal fears and worries regarding several factors. They are the possibility of being sources of infection, being isolated/quarantined, putting family members and other staff at risk, fear of improper use of personal protective equipment, fear of household problems due to lockdown and medical insurance. The possible solutions proposed are an increase of manpower and better community awareness to reduce stigma(Mohindra, et al., 2020).",
