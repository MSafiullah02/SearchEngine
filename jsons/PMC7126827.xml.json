Taxchinin A (1), isolated from Taxus chinensis, was the first naturally occurring taxoid to be correctly assigned as the A-nortaxane skeleton,4 although brevifoliol (2) was the first natural taxoid with the A-nortaxane skeleton to be isolated from the leaves of T. brevifolia, it was incorrectly assigned to have a taxa-4(20),11-diene system.5 We have also isolated taxchinin A and brevifoliol from the leaves and stems of T. chinensis and they were found to be the most abundant taxoids in the leaves and stem of this plant (Fig. 1\n).",

Therefore the derivatives of taxchinin A and brevifoliol, consisting of the various unsaturated ketones at ring A and ring C, were designed and synthesized. The total 21 synthetic compounds, accompanying the parent compounds 1 and 2, were subjected to a cytotoxic screening of human non-small lung cancer (A549) cell line.

The significant cytotoxicity of the 5-oxo-13-substituted taxchinin A 11 and 15 may be due to the conformational change in the taxane rings as reflected in certain key J-coupling. The coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 is an important descriptor of the shape of the taxoids, which serves as a reporter of the dihedral angle along the bottom portion of the B ring.15, 16, 17 Among all obtained taxoids (1\u201323), only compounds 11 and 15 showed similar coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 (Table 2\n). In compound 11 the J\n2\u20133 is 7.6 Hz; in 15 it is 7.1 Hz, which suggested that 11 and 15 might have the similar conformations which are different from those of the other derivatives.",

The observed SAR of these derivatives is very interesting which shows that exocyclic unsaturated ketone at ring C is the key structural element for the activity, while the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone positioned at ring A has no effect for the activity. Moreover, 5-oxo-13-substituted taxchinin A 11 and 15 are the most potent derivatives among this series of compounds with IC50 of 0.48 and 0.75 \u03bcM, respectively, which may be due to the conformational change in the taxane rings, as reflected in the key J-coupling between H-2 and H-3. Further investigation on the SAR utilizing a CoMFA method was carried out. The resulting 3D-QSAR model provides an invaluable tool to design more cytotoxic compounds. With the employment of all of these results, further design, synthesis, and cytotoxic evaluation are ongoing in our laboratory and the results will be reported in due course.",

The CoMFA grid spacing was 2.0 \u00c5 in the x, y, and z directions. The default value of 30 kcal/mol was set as the maximum steric and electrostatic energy cutoff. Minimum-sigma (column filtering) was set to be 2.0 kcal/mol. The regression analysis was carried out using the full cross-validated partial least-squares (PLS) method (leave-one-out) with CoMFA standard options for scaling of variables. The final model (non-cross-validated conventional analysis) was developed with the optimum number of components equal to that yielding the highest q\n2.",
