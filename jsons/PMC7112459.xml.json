Such bifurcations already occur robustly in relatively low-dimensional\ndynamical systems.17 The closely related\nhomoclinic bifurcation often marks the point where a limit cycle is destroyed and thus\ncauses a discontinuous phase transitions in many systems. One of these is the adaptive SIS\nmodel: an SIS system, where additionally the susceptible nodes try to avoid infection by\nrewiring their links away from infected nodes.13 In the adaptive SIS model, the importance of these homoclinic\nbifurcations is very minor but can play the role of an epidemic threshold in a small\nparameter space. Homoclinic bifurcations have also been observed in other network models,\nwhere information is exchanged globally between nodes, e.g., Ref. 18.",
