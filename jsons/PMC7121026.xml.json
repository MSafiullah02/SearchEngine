Although the SARS epidemic has subsided, many authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have warned of the possible re-emergence of this highly infectious disease. Thus, the sensitive tests for SARS are of great public health importance. However, a number of diagnostic tests are not very sensitive during the early phase of the disease. For instance, the use of nasopharyngeal aspirates using an early generation reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV has a sensitivity of only 32% on d 3 of the disease (7). This severe limitation has restricted our ability to identify patients in a prompt manner and to institute isolation and treatment.",

Conventional RT-PCR approaches are normally qualitative in nature and require time-consuming and contamination-prone post-PCR analysis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR has overcome many of these shortcomings and has been increasingly adopted by various laboratories for SARS diagnosis (2, 11\u201315). With suitable instrumentation, this technology allows data to be recorded and analyzed during PCR cycling. Furthermore, it runs as a closedtube system, and postamplification manipulation can be eliminated. Thus, this methodology reduces the risk of contamination and minimizes hands-on time. The entire amplification process requires only 3 h and allows such technology to be used for high-throughput application.",

            "text": "During the SARS outbreak, the PCR-based testing for SARS was focused mainly on the analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stools (7, 11). An early study reported that SARS-CoV RNA was detected in 32% of nasopharyngeal aspirates from SARS patients studied at a mean of 3.2 d after the onset of illness, and the detection rate increased to 68% at d 14 (7). In the same study, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in 97% of stool samples collected at a mean of 14.2 d after symptom onset. Similarly, viral RNA was detected in 42% of urine samples collected from the SARS patients at a mean of 15.2 d after onset (7). Despite the high sensitivity of stool sample testing, early detection of SARS-CoV still suffers from a lack of high sensitivity. Although most of the assays have been predominantly focused on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stools, the quantitative interpretation of these data can be difficult because of the inability to standardize such data as a result of numerous factors, such as sampling technique for nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine volume, variations of bowel transit time (e.g., during diarrhea), or stool consistency. On the other hand, plasma/serum-based assays may allow the precise and standardized quantitative expression of viral loads, thus enabling the assessment of disease severity and prognosis. Detection of viral nucleic acids in plasma/serum has been well established for viral load studies for numerous other viruses (16, 17). At the beginning of the SARS outbreak, a single report showed the relatively low sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV RNA in plasma using an ultracentrifugation-based approach, with low concentrations of SARS-CoV detected in the plasma of a patient 9 d after disease onset (2). Subsequently, together with the improvement of viral RNA extraction in which plasma or serum requires no ultracentrifugation, two real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays, one aimed toward the polymerase region and the other toward the nucleocapsid region of the virus genome (Fig. 1), were developed for measuring the concentration of SARS-CoV RNA in serum/plasma samples from SARS patients (13,14). In these assays, the absolute calibration curves are constructed by serial dilutions of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified, single-stranded synthetic DNA oligonucleotides specifying the studied amplicons (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that such single-stranded oligonucleotides reliably mimic the products of the reverse-transcription step and produce calibration curves that are identical to those obtained using T7-transcribed RNA (18, 19). The use of such calibration methodology significantly simplifies the process of obtaining a calibration curve when compared with the labor-intensive preparation of calibration curve involving amplicon subcloning and in vitro transcription.\n\n\n",

This in vitro-transcribed RNA is usually generated by subcloning the amplicon behind a T7 RNA polymerase promoter in a plasmid vector. However, this procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming, which is unsuitable when a large number of RT-PCR systems must be constructed in a short period of time. An alternative method can be used to construct a calibration curve, using synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the amplified sequence. Previous data have shown that such single-stranded oligonucleotides reliably mimic the products of the reverse transcription step and produce calibration curves that are essentially identical to those obtained using T7-transcribed RNA (18).3.Our studies have revealed that 0.28 mL of plasma is the minimal sample volume for the robust detection of SARS-CoV RNA in serum. Thus, 3 mL of blood samples should be sufficient for testing.4.When plain blood samples are left unprocessed, their corresponding serum RNA concentrations will fluctuate over time (26). This artifactual fluctuation may be owing to several factors, such as release of RNA from necrotic and/or apoptotic blood cells and the stability of the original and the newly released RNA. To guarantee a reliable serum RNA concentration, we recommend all blood samples be stored at 4\u00b0C and be processed as soon as possible.5.According to our pre-analytical studies, no significant differences in viral RNA concentrations were observed between serum stored at -20\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C (unpublished data). Nonetheless, we routinely store serum samples at -80\u00b0C.6.The use of one-step, one-enzyme RT-PCR with rTth polymerase has several advantages over the two-enzyme RT-PCR: (1) it has been reported that the Tth polymerase is more resistant to inhibitors present in biological specimens than Taq polymerase (27); (2) the rTth polymerase is thermostable and thus allows the reverse transcription to perform at high temperature (60\u00b0C), thereby minimizing the secondary structures present in the RNA; and (3) as both reverse-transcription and PCR are carried out in a single tube, this reduces both hands-on time and the risk of contamination.\n",
