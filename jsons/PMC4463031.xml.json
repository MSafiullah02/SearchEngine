Overall, H. influenzae (30.8%) and S. pneumoniae (20.4%) were the most common bacterial agents, which is in accordance with the etiology of AOM in Costa Rica, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Germany, France and Israel.20\u201327 A previous South African study conducted over a decade ago, also implicated H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae as the leading causes of complicated-AOM in South African children.28 We also detected a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses in 74.2% of the NPA collected at the time of AOM episodes. The similarity of our results across HIV+, HIV\u2212 and HEU children suggests that there was no meaningful difference in the etiology of AOM by HIV status.

The resistance of S. pneumoniae serotype 19A to penicillin was mainly intermediate, thereby highlighting the lack of resistance from this usually penicillin-resistant serotype.39 These findings are consistent with recent reports from other countries,23,24 and underscore the observed change in antibiotic resistance to penicillin over the past decade, particularly because a high percentage of samples were resistant to penicillin in the previous South African study.28 Similarly, most other vaccine serotypes were also intermediate in their resistant to penicillin. Our study also indicated that NTHi-positive episodes were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (60.8%) and ampicillin (13.9%), consistent with previous reports from South Africa.24,28 Furthermore, the low resistance for S. pneumoniae and NTHi to amoxicillin/clavulanate supports its continued use in the treatment of AOM as recommended in South Africa.37 In addition to antibiotic treatment for AOM, vaccination indicated against AOM may help control the associated disease burden.40,41 Because more than 50% of the isolated serotypes in our study were PCV7-serotypes and the non-PCV7-serotypes among unvaccinated children were 3, 5, 6A and 19A in conjunction to the burden of NTHi, it may be useful to consider the potential value of PCVs in their protection against AOM in South Africa.",

A high viral RSV load in combination with S. pneumoniae has been associated with an increased risk of AOM, and the same study also showed an increased risk of AOM during co-infections with hBoV and H. influenzae,54 combination found in 6 episodes in our study. Further studies to better understand the mechanisms of viral\u2013bacterial co-detection in the nasopharynx and the development of AOM in this region are required.",

MEF samples in this study were not analyzed for respiratory viruses due to the insufficient sample volume. The lack of a control group of healthy children restricts this study from addressing whether viral identification was co-incidental or causally related to AOM. Other limitations of our study are that the number of HIV+ children enrolled was lower than the number of HIV\u2212 and HEU children; besides HEU were presumed to be HIV-uninfected without a confirmatory HIV test, and the HIV\u2212 group included children born to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected mothers. The presence of some viruses was only accessed by PCR while for others PCR and immunofluorescence assay were used, so comparisons were limited. Results from a single center should also be interpreted cautiously when considering potential national implications. In addition, our study did not examine the association of NTHi with recurrent AOM cases, which has been recognized previously.55 Furthermore, the lack of a difference in bacterial etiology between vaccinated and unvaccinated children was possibly due to the low vaccination coverage at the time of the study, whereas such differences have been noted elsewhere following introduction of PCV7.56 A follow-up etiology study in the context of high vaccination coverage should be performed.",
