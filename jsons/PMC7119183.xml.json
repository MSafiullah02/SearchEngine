            "text": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of 29.7 kb that belongs to genus \u03b2 of the Coronavirinae subfamily (de Groot et al., 2008, Enjuanes et al., 2008, Gorbalenya, 2008). The replicase gene is encoded within the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the SARS-CoV genome, including two overlapping open reading frames (ORF) named ORFs 1a and 1b, the latter being translated by a ribosomal frameshift upstream of the ORF 1a stop codon (Brierley et al., 1989, Thiel et al., 2003, Ziebuhr, 2005). Translation of both ORFs in the cytoplasm of infected cells, results in the synthesis of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are processed by two viral proteinases to yield 16 functional non-structural proteins (nsps) (Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). These non-structural proteins are the components of the membrane-anchored replication\u2013transcription complex (Stertz et al., 2007). The largest non-structural protein of SARS-CoV is the multifunctional nsp3 protein that comprises 1922 amino acid residues. It has been proposed that nsp3 could act as a replication/transcription scaffolding protein (Imbert et al., 2008). At least seven domains have been identified in nsp3 based on amino acid secondary structure prediction, phylogenetic conservation, structure and functional analysis (Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). These domains are: (i) the N-terminal acidic domain, called nsp3a, that adopts a ubiquitin-like globular fold (Serrano et al., 2007); (ii) the ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase (ADRP), named nsp3b (Saikatendu et al., 2005); (iii) the SARS unique domain (SUD), also called nsp3c, that binds RNA G quadruplexes (Tan et al., 2009); (iv) the nsp3d domain that contains two subdomains involved in the papain-like proteinase (PL2pro) activity (Harcourt et al., 2004), and another one with a ubiquitin-like fold; and (v) the additional domains (nsp3e\u2013g) that include a RNA binding domain, a transmembrane (TM) region and a zinc finger motif. In a recent report nsp3 has been shown to be an interferon antagonist (Devaraj et al., 2007). In this sense, the papain-like protease domain has a deubiquitinating activity that shows a deISGylation activity that could be involved in the inhibition of interferon responses (Barretto et al., 2005, Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2009, Lindner et al., 2005, Lindner et al., 2007). Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like ligands is a multistep process, carried out by a well-defined enzymatic pathway, which is required to maintain physiological levels and functional activities of several cellular proteins. In addition, the reversal pathway, named deubiquitination, has been recognized as an important process in the regulation of protein degradation by the proteasome. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to modify host ubiquitination and deubiquitination machinery to modulate cell cycle, to interfere with innate and adaptative immune responses and to enhance virus replication and egress (Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009). In this sense, it has been shown that several viral proteins are directly modified by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins during the virus cycle. Moreover, some viruses encode their own ubiquitinating or deubiquitinating enzymes that may alter the ubiquitination level of cellular and viral targets (Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009).",

It has been shown that SARS-CoV E protein plays an important, but not well-defined role in virus assembly and budding. The SARS-CoV E gene has previously been shown to be a non-essential gene, although deletion of this gene from the viral genome reduces virus titers in cultured cells by 20- to 200-fold in relation to the wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-wt), depending on the cell type infected (DeDiego et al., 2007). SARS-CoV lacking the E gene is attenuated in the highly sensitive hACE-2 transgenic mouse model and in hamsters, and it has been proposed that the E gene is a virulence factor (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008).",

In this article, we report the construction of a recombinant SARS-CoV expressing E protein linked to two tandem affinity tags [influenza haemmaglutinning (HA) and a FLAG epitope] spaced by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site throughout the C terminus of E protein. This system allowed the rapid purification of E and associated proteins from SARS-CoV-infected cells. Using this system, the interaction of SARS-CoV envelope protein with structural proteins S and M, and with the multifunctional protein nsp3 was identified. In addition, the binding of E protein to cellular proteins including dynein heavy chain, fatty acid synthase, aminopeptidase puromycin sensitive, transmembrane protein 43 and lactate dehydrogenase A is shown. In this paper, we focused on E-nsp3 binding that was mediated through the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain-1 of nsp3 in the absence of other viral proteins. Moreover, these two proteins colocalized in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV infected cells. In this report, evidence showing that E protein is ubiquitinated in cells is also provided. Taken together these data showed an interaction of SARS-CoV structural E protein with a replicase component (nsp3), that could be implicated in the virus life cycle influencing E protein ubiquitination and turnover.",

Total RNA from mock-infected cells or cells infected with the SARS-CoV-wt, the virus lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-\u2206E), or the SARS-CoV-EtagCt virus were isolated and amplified by RT-PCR. E, M and N gene sgmRNAs were amplified using a forward primer complementary to the leader sequence and reverse primers specific for each gene. A band corresponding to wild-type E mRNA was detected in cells infected with the parental SARS-CoV while no band was detected in SARS-CoV-\u2206E-infected cells, as expected. In the case of cells infected with SARS-CoV-EtagCt, a PCR product of 340 bp corresponding to mRNA encoding the tagged E protein was identified (Fig. 1B). The sequence of this PCR product maintained the sequence introduced in the SARS-CoV-EtagCt virus. No differences in the PCR products derived from the mRNA encoding M and N proteins were detected (Fig. 1B). To study tagged E protein expression, extracts from mock-infected cells, or cells infected with SARS-CoV-wt, SARS-CoV-\u2206E or SARS-CoV-EtagCt were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1C). A SARS-CoV E protein-specific monoclonal antibody generated in our laboratory was used to detect the expression of this protein (J. L. Nieto-Torres, M. L. DeDiego, E. Alvarez, and L.

The densitrometric scanning of those bands showed only \u223c 5% difference between E-wt and E-tag, indicating that the expression of tagged E protein is unaffected by the extra sequence added to E. In addition, using FLAG or HA epitope specific monoclonal antibodies, a band corresponding to tagged E protein was observed in cells infected with SARS-CoV-EtagCt, whereas no bands were detected in both SARS-CoV-wt or SARS-CoV-\u2206E-infected cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the E-tagged protein maintained both epitopes. As a control of infection, SARS-CoV N protein was detected in all the viruses (Fig. 1C). No differences in N protein expression levels were detected between cells infected with SARS-CoV-wt, SARS-CoV-\u2206E and SARS-CoV-EtagCt.",

Cell lysates were applied to an anti-HA resin and bound proteins were eluted by proteolytic cleavage of the tag at the TEV protease site. Eluates from the proteolytic cleavage on the anti-HA resin were incubated with an anti-FLAG agarose and proteins bound to matrix were eluted by specific competition with FLAG peptide. To identify proteins that copurified with E-tag, the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. In the case of purifications from cells infected with SARS-CoV-EtagCt, several protein bands were detected, whereas purifications in parallel using extracts from mock-infected cells or cells infected with the wild-type virus did not reveal any detectable protein band (Fig. 4A). These data indicated that the proteins identified specifically bound to E-tag protein. Some of the bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry to identify the corresponding proteins by screening against the available NCBI protein database. A set of 12 proteins was reproducibly identified in at least two out of four experiments with significant MASCOT scores (p\n > 0.05) (Table 1\n).

All infected cells showing the presence of E protein also stained with the nsp3 specific antibody giving an identical pattern, consistent with a perinuclear distribution (Fig. 7\n). The localization of the tagged E protein was the same as untagged E in infected cells indicating that the tag sequence did not change the E protein localization (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results suggest that nsp3 and E protein colocalize in the cytoplasm of infected cells and that the absence of E protein did not change the subcellular distribution of nsp3.",

The cells were lysed 24 h post transfection, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and E protein was detected by Western blotting using an antibody E protein specific (Fig. 8A). An additional band corresponding to monoubiquitinated E protein was detected only when E protein was expressed in presence of Ub-OK (Fig. 8A, lane 3). By contrast, samples from cells expressing E protein (Fig. 8A, lane 2) or Ub-OK (Fig. 8A, lane 1) alone did not show the novel band. The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was expressed in parallel to serve as a positive control of ubiquitination (Fig. 8B). In this case, different lower migrating bands corresponding to different ubiquitination states of the protein were observed.

It plays important roles in coronavirus assembly and morphogenesis (Fischer et al., 1998, Ortego et al., 2002, Ortego et al., 2007), alteration of the cellular membrane permeability (Liao et al., 2004, Liao et al., 2006) and virus\u2013host interaction (Liu et al., 2007). In this study, we used a TAP approach coupled to mass spectrometry to identify viral proteins interacting with SARS-CoV E protein that could be important to regulate its functions. This led to the observation of interactions between the E and other viral structural proteins such as S and M. Cellular proteins significantly binding to E protein were also identified, as dynein heavy chain, fatty acid synthase, aminopeptidase puromycin sensitive, phosphofructokinase platelet, tubulin alpha and beta, actin beta, transmembrane protein 43 and lactate dehydrogenase A. The interaction between E and M coronavirus proteins has already been reported in other CoV species, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), by coimmunoprecipitation in virus-infected or transfected cells (Corse and Machamer, 2003, Lim and Liu, 2001, Maeda et al., 1999). The role of SARS-CoV E protein in virus assembly has been analyzed studying the formation of VLPs both in mammalian and insect cells (Ho et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2004, Mortola and Roy, 2004, Siu et al., 2008), and by reverse genetics (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008). Although there are conflicting reports on the proteins necessary for the formation of VLPs in SARS-CoV (Ho et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2004, Mortola and Roy, 2004), it has been clearly shown that a recombinant virus lacking E gene produced virions with the same morphology as the wt virus, indicating that E protein is not necessary to obtain infectious SARS-CoV (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In addition to the interaction of E protein with S and M, a novel interaction between E protein and the non-structural protein nsp3 was identified. The nsp3-E interaction was detected by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of lysates from SARS-CoV-infected cells. Furthermore, nsp3 and E protein colocalized in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that nsp3 and E protein may form a protein complex in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The interaction among SARS-CoV proteins has been studied using different approaches (yeast two-hybrid assay, mammalian two-hybrid assay and coimmunoprecipitation) (Pan et al., 2008, von Brunn et al., 2007). Studies using a two-hybrid system have shown the interaction of E protein with nsp1, nsp8, nsp11, 3b, 7b and 9b proteins (von Brunn et al., 2007). Some of these interactions were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of proteins expressed in human HEK 293-transfected cells. In addition, interaction between E and 7a proteins was detected using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, although this interaction was not confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation nor pull-down approaches (Pan et al., 2008). Nevertheless, these articles did not describe the interaction between E protein and the structural proteins M and S, or the non-structural nsp3 protein. This was probably due to the limitation of two-hybrid systems in detecting proteins with transmembrane domains that could prevent the transfer of bait\u2013ligand complexes to the cell nucleus, where these complexes lead to transcription. The system described here, allowed the identification of E protein interacting partners in the context of SARS-CoV infection overcoming potential limitations of two-hybrid assays. Interestingly, a recent report identifying the SARS-CoV structural proteins showed that, in addition to the well know structural proteins S, E, M, and N, nsp3 is a tentative novel minor virion component (Neuman et al., 2008). A network of protein\u2013protein interactions within SARS-CoV components has been proposed (Neuman et al., 2008). In this network, the interaction between nsp3 and E protein could, in principle, be explained by an indirect link through the 9b protein in the virion. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated in an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay that nsp3 specifically interacts with E protein in the absence of other viral proteins. This data suggested that the interaction of nsp3 with E protein is most likely a direct interaction, although the requirement of proteins from the reticulocyte lysate assay could not be formally excluded.",

It has recently been proposed that nsp3 may act as a replication/transcription scaffolding protein (Imbert et al., 2008). In this report, it has been shown that nsp3, in particular the PLP domain, interacted with a large number of partners of the replication/transcription complex. This data in combination with the presence of a transmembrane domain within nsp3 suggested that this protein could act bringing several proteins into close proximity, within the double membrane environment. In the present report, we showed that E colocalized with nsp3 in the cytoplasm during the infection. In this sense, nsp3 may bring the E protein into the vicinity of the replication/transcription complex.",

            "text": "It has been shown that ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes are important in the viral life cycle (Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009). Several viral proteins possess deubiquitinating activity. One of them is the PLpro domain of the SARS-CoV nsp3 protein that belongs to the USP family of deubiquitinases (DUBs) and has deubiquinatin activity in vitro (Lindner et al., 2005). Moreover, it has been proposed that the PLpro domain might act protecting the viral replication complex from proteasomal degradation via deubiquitination. However, the viral and cellular targets of the nsp3 DUB domain remain completely unknown. Here, we describe that SARS-CoV E protein is ubiquitinated in vitro and in cells, although the function of this post-translational modification in the course of infection is not known. Nps3-E interaction could have a role in controlling the ubiquitination status of E protein during the infection and, as a consequence, on its turnover and modulation of the innate and adaptative immune responses or virus replication and egress, similarly to what has been suggested in other viral systems (Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009).",
