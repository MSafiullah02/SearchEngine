Reflecting major efforts to identify a cost-effective alternative to high-price passive immunization with anti-RSV nAbs, a number of compounds have entered advanced preclinical development and clinical testing in recent years (Table 1). Breakthroughs in the structural and functional characterization of the viral entry machinery and polymerase complexes in the past decade [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21] have furthermore created a novel opportunity for structure-informed mechanistic characterization and ligand optimization.

Inserted into the viral envelope in type 2 transmembrane protein orientation, the native attachment protein tetramer consists of membrane-distal globular head domains and a membrane-proximal \u03b1-helical coiled-coil stalk (Figure 1A) [1,22]. The head domains of paramyxovirus attachment protein types assume the overall six-bladed propeller fold of sialidases. However, only HN proteins, which are found, for instance, on members of the respirovirus and rubulavirus genera, have actual neuraminidase activity, and only paramyxoviruses with HN-type attachment proteins use sialic acid moieties displayed on the target cell plasma membrane as receptor. In contrast, morbilliviruses such as MeV and henipaviruses enter cells through proteinaceous receptors, CD150 and Nectin-4 in the case of MeV [23,24,25], and ephrin-type receptors in the case of NiV [26,27], which eliminates the need for neuraminidase catalytic activity. The sialidase-like fold of the head domains in nevertheless conserved also across the morbilliviruses and henipaviruses, indicating that sialic acid-mediated attachment to target cells represents the entry strategy of a common ancestral paramyxovirus.",

They are synthesized as bio-inactive precursor proteins F0 that require proteolytic maturation. The physiological oligomer is a homo-trimer, and only the trimer can assume a native conformation and gain intracellular transport competence. Accordingly, newly synthesized F trimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and in the case of the Morbilliviruses the ER is also the site of subsequent hetero-oligomerization of attachment and fusion protein complexes (24). F trimers assume initially a metastable prefusion fold that resembles a lollipop-like shape (Figure 1A\u2013F), consisting of a membrane-proximal coiled-coil prefusion stalk and a single globular head domain. Both stalk and head domains are cooperatively formed by all three monomers [1]. The stalk connects to the transmembrane domains and short C-terminal cytosolic tails. Anchoring of the transmembrane domains in the lipid envelope adds stability to the prefusion conformation. Consequently, crystal structures of prefusion PIV5 and NiV F ectodomains could only be obtained when the transmembrane domains were replaced with soluble trimerization domains [21,34]. Crystallization of prefusion PIV3, MeV, and RSV F required additional disulfide bonds and/or cavity filling mutations to stabilize the soluble ectodomains [35,36,37]. ",

Subsequent concerted hairpin formation by several F trimers and zippering of the 6HB domains locally introduces extreme negative curvature (away from the cytoplasm or virion lumen, respectively) into the lipid bilayers, resulting in local disarray of the lipid layers at the approaching fusion tips that facilitates membrane merger [22,43].

Most synthetic anti-F peptides are derived from residues of the homotypic or a closely related HR-B domain and block 6HB closure through competition with endogenous HR-B for access to the HR-A triple helix grooves [62]. Consequently, these peptides act late in the F refolding cascade, trapping the trimer in a pre-hairpin conformation, analogous to the mechanism of action proposed for the only clinically approved direct-acting antiviral peptide, the HIV entry inhibitor Fuzeon [63,64]. Although efficacious, Fuzeon also embodies the liabilities of HR-derived therapeutic peptides [65]: the drug product is difficult to manufacture resulting in high treatment cost, oral bioavailability is lacking, and the virus-derived peptides are immunogenic, causing severe injection site reactions [66]. Reflecting these limitations of synthetic peptides, advanced preclinical development and clinical trials have mostly focused on small-molecule antivirals. ",

            "text": "As of February 2020, eight small-molecule RSV entry inhibitors have advanced to some stage of clinical testing (Table 1). Common characteristics of most of these drug candidates include exceptionally high potency in the nanomolar or sub-nanomolar range, oral bioavailability, high target specificity, and a very low genetic barrier against viral resistance. Although the chemotypes are structurally distinct, all of the advanced RSV entry inhibitors for which pharmacophores have been solved bind to overlapping druggable sites in the central F cavity near the base of the F head domain (Figure 2), stabilizing the prefusion conformation of the trimer by locking the fusion peptide in place [67]. Accordingly, escape mutations affect residues in the fusion peptides (i.e., FL141W) or lining the binding site (i.e., FD486N and FF488Y). Resistance hot-spots are located at the interface between prefusion F head and stalk domains (i.e., FD401E and FD489E) [68], which contributes to stabilizing the metastable prefusion conformation of F proteins [21,36]. Consistent with the distinct positions of resistance sites, viral escape is thought to reflect distinct principles. Substitutions directly lining the target site or allosterically affecting its shape reduce binding affinity of the ligand without altering the conformational stability of prefusion F [67]. Secondly, mutations in the F head-stalk interface such as FD401E and FD489E can destabilize the prefusion fold, narrowing the window of opportunity for productive interaction of the inhibitor with prefusion F by accelerating the rate of F refolding [68]. This kinetics-based secondary escape mechanism is characterized phenotypically by F hyperfusion activity. ",

Firstly, several hot spots have been identified that mediate universal escape from inhibition by all advanced RSV entry inhibitors tested, despite the structural diversity of the different chemotypes [68]. The existence of these pan-resistance sites suggests that it may be challenging to proactively counteract viral escape through synthetic scaffold optimization [69]. Supporting this notion, a large-scale high-throughput drug screen using a recombinant RSV strain carrying a signature pan-resistance mutation did not return any hits blocking F protein activity, although entry inhibitors typically emerge readily and are often pharmacodominant in anti-RSV drug screens [70,71]. Secondly, studies in the mouse RSV pathogenesis model have demonstrated early that signature pan-resistance mutations such as FD401E do not mandatorily coincide with viral attenuation in vivo [68], raising substantial concern that entry inhibitor-resistant RSV may emerge rapidly in the field, and remain pathogenic and possibly able to spread.

An exception is a chemically well-behaved small-molecule MeV inhibitor, AS-48, which potently blocks MeV F protein-mediated membrane fusion [61,72]. Primary resistance hot spot to AS-48 is F residue N462 [73], which locates to the non-covalent interaction network that affixes the base of the prefusion F head domain to the HR-B derived stalk (Figure 2). Resolution of this intramolecular interface was demonstrated to be a prerequisite for F refolding [74] and drug-resistant MeV F was hyperfusogenic [73,75], illuminating a conserved role of this microdomain in controlling the conformational stability of prefusion F proteins. Ultimate confirmation that AS-48 blocks MeV entry through locking F in a prefusion conformation came from an MeV FM94G/N462S double mutant, which carries an additional substitution in a defined cavity formed by the F2 subunit and depends on dose-dependent stabilization by AS-48 to maintain an intracellular transport-competent conformation [73]. Once displayed at the cell surface, the FM94G/N462S/AS-48 complex can be efficiently stimulated by MeV H upon receptor binding, underscoring that the compound indeed preserves a fusion-competent fold of F.

A cryo-EM structure of HPIV3 F complexed with nAb PIA174 likewise locates the binding site to the apex of the prefusion F trimer, establishing contact with residues of all three F protomers [37]. Underscoring that membrane-distal domains of the F proteins are most immune-accessible, two NiV F nAb complexes were recently reported that locate the binding sites at the apex of prefusion F [86] and an adjacent quaternary epitope [87], respectively (Figure 5). The binding sites of these antibodies are conserved in hendra virus F, resulting in good cross-neutralization. ",

Pharmacodominance of this site for all highly potent small molecule entry inhibitors characterized so far is nevertheless remarkable, since mapping of nAbs has revealed this diverse set of alternative sites in membrane-distal regions of the F head that, when engaged, stabilize the F prefusion fold. The current lack of small molecule ligands directed against these antigenic sites presumably directly reflects the fundamental differences in the nature of binding sites and mode of target engagement by antibodies and small molecule drugs. Typically, protein-protein interfaces including those between antigen-antibody are flat in geometry, span a large internal surface (the footprint of an antibody is approx. 1000 to 2000 \u00c52), and include numerous polar and hydrophobic interactions [88]. By comparison, small molecules cover at most 300\u2013500 \u00c52 of a protein surface and target sites show concavity, ensuring favorable contacts with multiple sites of the ligand. Although it is therefore challenging to recapitulate the effect of nAbs with small molecules, functional mimicry can be achieved when hot-spot residues on the protein surface are known that contribute overproportionally to the interaction [89]. However, the promise of superior pharmacokinetic properties of small molecule drugs, greater flexibility of administration through different routes, and superior stability and cost-effectiveness has revitalized efforts to replace antibodies with confirmed therapeutic impact with small molecules that mimic antibody binding and functionality [90]. Proof-of-concept for the clinical potential of the approach comes, for instance, from attempts of small molecule-targeting of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway for cancer therapy [91] and the nAb epitope-informed design of a small molecule alternative to a broadly neutralizing anti-influenza virus antibody directed against the HA stem domain [92]. Given the dramatic expansion in high-resolution structural insight in productive nAb-F protein interaction in recent years, it will be exciting to see whether this knowledge can be equally harnessed for the structure-guided development of new classes of pneumo- and paramyxovirus entry inhibitors.

Given the mechanistic similarities and the originally encouraging performance of presatovir in the human RSV challenge model, there is little reason to assume that the alternative entry inhibitor scaffolds that have been successfully tested in the challenge model may fare better in phase IIb trials. High-resolution structural model of entry inhibitors with prefusion F have greatly advanced the appreciation of the molecular mechanism of fusion inhibition but have not yet suggested a path to how viral pan-resistance could be counteracted through proactive ligand engineering. Despite sub-nanomolar potency in cell culture assays and initially very attractive drug profile properties, therapeutic targeting of the base of the prefusion F protein cavity may ultimately not be the most effective approach to address the RSV problem.

Ultimately, the therapeutic targeting of the polymerase may be more fruitful for two main reasons [106]: (i) all enzymatic functions of the viral polymerase complex, initiation of RNA synthesis, RNA elongation, mRNA capping, and cap methylation, must be performed multiple times to complete an individual viral replication cycle, providing\u2014in contrast to entry inhibition\u2014repeated opportunities for interference, and (ii) polymerase blockers suppress not only the synthesis of structural virion components directly, but also heighten virus susceptibility to the innate host antiviral response, since they prevent the expression of viral non-structural immune-modulatory proteins that are essential for viral pathogenesis [107,108].
