He was referred to King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh on 18 May 2015 for further chemotherapy and possible stem cell transplant. Because the disease was not in complete remission, he received several lines of chemotherapy until July. On 29 July 2015 (hospital day 1), the patient presented to the emergency department with cellulitis and sepsis and was admitted for intravenous antibiotics therapy. On hospital day 12, he was given the SMILE protocol (methtrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, L\u2010asparginase and prednisolone). He developed thrombocytopaenia (the nadir platelet count was 2000 per cubic millimetre) and neutropaenia (absolute neutrophil count of 160 per cubic millimetre). The subsequent cycles of chemotherapy were held. On hospital day 21, he developed fever and productive cough with new infiltrate on chest radiograph (Figure 1) and was treated as healthcare\u2010associated pneumonia. Sputum culture on hospital day 23 showed Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii; MERS\u2010CoV sputum real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2013PCR) was negative. On hospital day 42, repeated sputum MERS\u2010CoV rRT\u2013PCR was positive. On hospital day 43, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of increasing hypoxaemia and subsequently on hospital day 46 was intubated and ventilated mechanically. Chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates (Figure 1). He was managed with lung\u2010protective ventilation strategy and neuromuscular blockade. Repeated MERS\u2010CoV rRT\u2013PCR from tracheal aspirates remained positive until his death. Kidney function tests showed mild impairment with peak serum creatinine of 154 \u03bcmol/l. Liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase remained within normal range throughout the ICU stay. On hospital day 50, he died because of refractory shock and severe hypoxaemia. Throughout his ICU stay, he did not receive steroids, ribavirin or interferon.",

Informed consent was obtained from the patient's family. Under a complete aseptic technique using 2% chlorhexidine (chloraPrep with tent; CareFusion, El Paso, TX, USA) and full draping, a 14\u2010gauge (G) needle (Max Core; Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ, USA) was used for tissue sampling. Multiple passes through the right lung, left ventricle of the heart, right hepatic lobe, right kidney and right anterior thigh skeletal muscles (SM) were performed. Additional multiple biopsies also were obtained from the right side of the brain hemisphere using a Max Core needle after creating bone tract using an 11G bone injection needle bevelled tip (Tecres SPA, Verona, Italy). Full autopsy (evisceration) was not performed. Tissue samples were collected within 45 min from death to reduce the post\u2010mortem decomposition and artefact, and all tissue biopsies except those from the brain were performed under ultrasound guidance.",

Using standard histochemical methods, Masson's trichrome (MT), periodic acid\u2010Schiff (PAS), Grocott's methenamine special (GMS), Gram and Ziehl\u2013Nelseen (ZN) special stains were performed on lung tissue. A renal panel that included PAS, Jones\u2019 methenamine silver and MT was also performed on renal tissue, and PAS, PAS with diastase, MT and reticulin special stains were performed on liver tissue. Immunostaining for histiocytic marker CD68 and lymphoid cell markers CD45, CD3, CD4 and CD8 were performed. Lung tissue was stained for cytomegalovirus (CMV). All immunoassays were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines, using automated platform (Ventana Benchmark XT, Tucson, AZ, USA), and heat antigen retrieval by ultracell condition solution pH 8.4. The ultraview universal diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection kit was used for reaction visualisation. Correct positive and negative controls were utilised for histochemical and immunohistochemical (IHC) stains. Unfortunately, immunohistochemical work\u2010up using anti MERS\u2010CoV antibody to detect viral antigen in tissue was not performed. Table 1 summarises the IHC studies performed.",

Histopathological examination of lung tissue demonstrated severe acute haemorrhagic pneumonia and exudative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The histopathological changes were heterogeneous in severity. In the less affected areas, the lung parenchymal architecture was maintained and the alveolar spaces and interstitium contained variable numbers of pigmented pulmonary macrophages and scattered mononuclear inflammatory cells. Variable amounts of filamentous fibrin deposits were seen, mainly in the alveolar spaces (Figure 2A). In severely affected areas, the alveolar spaces were disrupted, ectatic and contained a large amount of blood and fibrin, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate and cellular debris (Figure 2B). Pneumocyte hyperplasia and reactive changes, denudation and sloughing of alveolar cells, rare multinucleated syncytial cells, congestion of the alveolar walls and hyaline membrane formation were evident (Figure 2C). Areas of confluent parenchymal necrosis were seen (Figure 2D). Focal peri\u2010bronchiolar acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate was seen. No granulomas were identified.

The histopathological findings in the lung consisted of haemorrhagic necrotising pneumonia and exudative DAD with heterogeneous severity. These changes are similar to those described in animal model by de Wit et al.8 and recently in humans by Ng et al.7 An interesting morphological finding was the presence of CD4+ lymphocytic intimal arteritis, indicating an active immune response to injurious stimulus. This vascular injury was focal and not associated with intimal fibrinoid necrosis or thrombus formation. Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4)/CD26 is a recently described receptor, by which MERS\u2010CoV enters target cells, and expressed in several types of cells including pneumocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells.6, 9 Pulmonary microvascular thrombosis was described in lethal MERS\u2010CoV in mice transgenic to human DPP4.10 The presence of more aggressive vascular insult and thrombotic event, probably contributing to the necrotising nature of lung disease, could not be excluded in our case. It is worth mentioning that during the clinical course, the patient had bacterial pneumonia which might have contributed to the pulmonary pathological findings at the time of post\u2010mortem examination. Another intriguing finding in examined lung tissue was the ultrastructural localisation of the VP not only in the pneumocytes, as described previously,7 but also in the alveolar macrophages.",

The presence of AKI in our patient is consistent with the recently published data on renal biopsy from a patient with MERS\u2010CoV infection.14 This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the presence of VP in renal PTEC. This finding supports the viral kidney trophism as a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of ARF in MERS\u2010CoV infection.
