This is not the case; even the term \u201csymbiosis\u201d is defined differently by different authors in different fields, by those in different geographic areas, and by those taught by different mentors. The term \u201csymbiosis\u201d was originally used by the German de Bary (1879) to mean \u201cliving together.\u201d His meaning referred to all situations where either similar or unlike organisms or species live together in an intimate association. This is typically thought to include \u201ccommensalism,\u201d \u201cmutualism,\u201d and \u201cparasitism.\u201d We prefer to include all such associations under the general term \u201csymbiosis\u201d but realize that our title does not comply, and many readers prefer to use a more specific term for symbiosis and other associations. In the preface of his book (1970), the eminent parasitologist William Trager quoted \u201cthe conflict in nature between dissimilar kinds of organisms has been popularly expressed in phrases like \u2018struggle for existence\u2019 and \u2018survival of the fittest.\u2019 Yet few people realize that mutual cooperation between different kinds of organisms\u2014symbiosis\u2014is just as important, and that the \u2018fittest\u2019 may be the one that most helps another to survive.\u201d",

Therefore, symbiont is a division of nature similar to \u201cterrestrial\u201d or \u201cmarine.\u201d The symbiont is characterized by where it lives rather than the quality of the relationship. For our purposes, we divide up the world into two kinds of organisms, free living and not free living. This accords us the advantage of comparing the quality of the relationship between free-living organisms and their habitat with that between host and symbiont. The symbiont is dependent upon the host as any inhabitant is on its habitat. We consider symbionts to include bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), bacteria, viruses, \u201cprotozoans,\u201d and metazoans and symbiosis to include commensalism, mutualism, parasitism, and other relationships. Moreover, all symbionts, even metazoans, observed best with a microscope will be considered microbes. More important, we will examine in this series a shift in the interaction among a host and some stage in the life cycle of the symbiont, whether it be free living, facultative, or obligate. We will emphasize that some symbiotic relationships can change from harmless to something that becomes far less favorable for the host.",

Noble et al. (1989) define it as an association between two different species of organisms in which the dependence of the parasite on its host is metabolic and involves mutual exchange of substances; this dependence is the result of a loss of genetic information by the parasite. There are several atypical kinds of parasites. An accidental one infects an unusual or unnatural host; a commensal one derives its substances from the food of its host; and an erratic, or aberrant, one infects an unusual site. A facultative parasite is usually parasitic but is capable of an independent existence, while an obligate one cannot lead an independent, nonparasitic existence. The late Gerald Schmidt\u2019s definitions are listed by Roberts and Janovy (2009). He considered a parasite the \u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d for parasitologists, a parasitologist as a quaint person who seeks truth in strange places and one who sits on one stool while staring at another, and parasitology as a study of the most common mode of life on earth. Many parasites have complicated life cycles with multiple hosts and with a variety of stages, not all of which harm or depend on the host. One can glean that students find it difficult to define a parasite. This series will treat a variety of facultative and other relationships.",

American parasitologists usually define an internal association as an infection, whether harm is caused or not or the organism is small or large. If the association is external, it is referred to as an infestation, and the symbiont is called an ectosymbiont or an ectoparasite. For an internal association to be called an infection, microbiologists usually restrict the agents to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Consequently, some authors restrict an infestation to a metazoan parasite (e.g., Maggenti et al. 2005). Barrows (2011) provided three meanings for an infestation: (1) a parasite\u2019s colonization, utilization, or both of the host; (2) a host being colonized, utilized, or both by parasites; and (3) and environment being colonized, utilized, or both by pests. Other authors consider an infestation to refer to a population rather than to individuals. Still, others use the word \u201cinfestation\u201d to suggest an action and the term \u201cinfection\u201d to suggest a condition or a state. Microorganisms such as oral bacteria that live naturally in the mouth or elsewhere in a body are not considered infections or infectious agents by many microbiologists, but the organisms are symbionts.",

An egg count of 20 per mg in a healthy person or 5 in one anemic with iron or protein deficiency usually indicates the threshold of disease.

            "text": "Temperature often regulates disease in marine animals to benefit stocks of all parties. For example, the English sole, Parophrys vetulus, arrives into its estuarine nursery area in the northern Oregon Coast from January to April, grows dramatically in the upper estuary during the summer, and then migrates offshore in the autumn, never to return inshore. When inshore, the sole gets infected by the microsporidian Glugea stephani that develops in the intestine at temperatures \u226515 \u00b0C. This agent appears to cause mortalities from September through November, but this period is when most of the fish routinely migrate offshore where the temperature remains less than 10 \u00b0C, a temperature that was shown experimentally to inhibit the microsporidian agent\u2019s development, which ultimately results in uninfective spores within a few months. Consequently, the parasite seldom harms the host stock. However, approximately 10 % of the sole stock remained in the upper estuary where an estimated 80 % of those fish had a rapidly developing infection and most probably died and decomposed or were eaten, dispersing the spores. Those fish plus the overwintering infected fish and few reservoir starry flounder juveniles (Platichthys stellatus) (a reservoir host is a primary host that harbors the pathogen but typically exhibits no ill effect and serves as a source of infection) provided infective spores for next year-class of sole (Olson 1981; Overstreet 1982).",

            "text": "Temperature also has a great bearing on many other pathogenic triggers. For example, the coccidian Calyptospora funduli commonly infects the liver, pancreas, and occasionally other tissues in the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, in the coastal Gulf of Mexico. The fish becomes infected by feeding on either the infected intermediate host Palaemonetes pugio (the common daggerblade grass shrimp) or related species. Infections are synchronous, meaning that all the developing stages are the same. Early developing stages and mature oocyst stages are rarely seen in the same fish. In some cases, over 95 % of the liver can be infected without causing any notable severe harm to the host. When heavily infected and lightly or noninfected killifish were maintained in outdoor raceways and freezing occurred, the heavily infected fish all selectively died. Presumably, that was because the liver serves as a storage reservoir for necessary glycogen, vitamins, minerals, and other necessary nutritional resources. Those resources found in 5\u201310 % of the liver were presumably not enough to satisfy the needs of the fish during stressful low-temperature conditions. A series of experimental infections conducted at about 22, 10, and 7 \u00b0C for periods between 5 and 20 days in length (Solangi et al. 1982) showed that both low-temperature treatments inhibited all developmental stages. When the fish were returned from the low temperatures to 22 \u00b0C, development of all the stages resumed except in fish exposed to 7 \u00b0C for 20 days. In those infections, many of the coccidian organisms were atrophied or disintegrated within their parasitophorous vacuoles, and necrosis also occurred in some of the pancreatic tissue. In any event, decreased parasitism during inhibition was not linked with a leucocytic inflammatory response. When fish remained at a constant temperature of about 24 \u00b0C, an inflammatory response to the organism commenced at day 18, intensified at day 20, and diminished by about day 30 (Hawkins et al. 1981, Solangi and Overstreet 1980). In other words, inflammation associated with infections in warm water begins as gamonts developed and ends after formation of the oocyst wall. Consequently, infections that occur during cold winters can be either helpful or harmful to the host, depending on the stage of the parasite, the extent of low-temperature exposure, the age of the fish, and other variables.",

The ascaridoid nematode Contracaecum multipapillatum in a coastal lagoon at Celest\u00fan, State of Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, infects as definitive hosts the olivaceous cormorant and the great egret. The intermediate host for this avian nematode is the Mayan cichlid (Cichlasoma urophthalmus). The juvenile in the fish host for all members of the genus Contracaecum is usually a third stage; however, in the warm area of Mexico, many of the juveniles had developed into the fourth stage. When these fourth-stage juveniles were fed to a kitten, they developed into adults in the intestine, often associated with hemorrhaging small ulcers (Vidal-Mart\u00ednez et al. 1994); they did not develop or cause a pathogenic response in rats, ducks, or chickens. People commonly eat the cichlid in Mexico and, consequently, are potential hosts.

Infections in this commercial oyster were most prevalent and had the highest intensity in Hong Kong between July and September. Kittens, monkeys, and puppies were fed the infective stage from oysters during every month, but those worms collected only from the warm months of August to October infected the mammals (Ko 1976). The worms penetrated the wall of the stomach and intestine, migrated to and lodged in various tissues, and often killed the hosts. To test this temperature-triggering condition, Ko (1977) obtained oysters during the infective season and acclimated them to 5, 15, about 24, 28, and 33 \u00b0C. Worms from these different temperature groups were fed to kittens, and infections were most abundant in the 33 \u00b0C group and were less so in the 28 \u00b0C group; only one kitten became infected from the 24 \u00b0C group, and no kitten from the 5 or 15 \u00b0C group became infected. Since people eat raw oysters, the nematode constitutes a potential public health risk.",

            "text": "Under normal environmental conditions, parasites seldom harm their hosts. When the habitat is a series of aquaculture ponds, several conditions are modified. The pond design usually accommodates a heavy density of snail intermediate hosts near the shallow shore where fish fry occur, and the fish stock inhabiting the middle of the ponds creates an abundance of prey for fish-eating birds. For example, primarily in Mississippi but also less so in adjacent states, the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, is reared, comprising a multimillion dollar industry. In the natural environment, catfishes, including their madtom host relatives, do not occur as juveniles in habitats where the host marsh ramshorn snail, Planorbella trivolvis, and American white pelican, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, occur and defecate in any abundance. Consequently, infections of the metacercaria (larval stage acquired from a cercaria shed by the ramshorn snail) of the pathogenic diplostomoid trematode Bolbophorus damnificus are relatively rare in those natural waters. A total of five different diplostomoid trematode species infecting the catfish were able to kill it in aquaculture environments. Two of these developed from cercariae shed from P. trivolvis that ultimately mature in the American white pelican; two were from worms shed from the ash gyro, Gyraulus parvus, that mature in the double-crested cormorant; and the fifth species is one that matures in seagulls. The most harmful species, B. damnificus, can be present in the catfish with infections of less than 40 metacercariae without harming it. Heavier infections seem to have an effect on the kidney of the fish aiding in their mortalities. In the shallow water where large numbers of infected snails occur, thousands of cercariae can penetrate the young catfish and kill it quickly, even before developing into metacercariae. This is in contrast to two other trematodes, Bursacetabulus pelecanus and Austrodiplostomum compactum, which both infected the nerve cord, brain, optic nerve, and eye and at least in experimental infections can occur as several hundred individuals without killing the host (Overstreet and Curran 2004). The trigger for mortality regarding B. damnificus can be more complicated than pure numbers. In experimental infections with fingerling channel catfish exposed to a sublethal infection of trematode cercariae per fish, they died when additionally exposed to the bacterium Edwardsiella ictaluri, the agent of enteric septicemia of catfish. Controls given either the cercariae or nothing did not die. Those given 7.5 \u00d7 105 colony-forming units per mL of bacteria for 30 min singularly without cercarial exposure started dying at day 7, and, by day 21, the percent cumulative mortality leveled at about 46 compared with 84 % for the group given both the cercariae and bacteria. Then at day 28 when the metacercariae fully developed, groups consisting of the remaining fish given only the trematode and of the negative controls were exposed to the bacteria. Both groups starting dying at day 7, but, by day 21, there was no significant difference in the percent cumulative mortality of about 18 % (Labrie et al. 2004). When contaminating forage fish that occur in the ponds in addition to the commercial catfish became exposed to the cercariae of B. damnificus, they did not become infected. On the other hand, there is an unnamed species of Bolbophorus which also infects both the same snail and pelican, concurrently with B. damnificus. However, it does not use the catfish as the second intermediate host, but it uses mosquitofish and sunfish, which it can kill when in high numbers (Overstreet et al. 2002). Also of note is the finding that channel catfish exposed to the E. ictaluri bacterium 1 day prior to being exposed to the pathogenic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis had 71 % mortality compared with 27, 29, and 0 % for those respectively given only the bacterium or the ciliate or given neither. The bacterium could be detected by PCR in the gills, brain, liver, and kidney of the fish whether infected with the ciliate or not, but, by day 8, the bacterium no longer persisted in the bacteria-only group except in the kidney (Shoemaker et al. 2012).",

Best known is Naegleria fowleri because it causes fatal \u201cprimary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM),\u201d but it is restricted to freshwater, and victims are typically those who swim for extended periods underwater in open bodies with a silty-muddy substratum. The swimmers\u2019 nasal mucosa becomes weakened to the point that the ameba can penetrate the membrane and enter the central nervous system (CNS) along the olfactory nerve. Because that site contains little cellular inflammatory response but provides a good medium for amebic growth, the organism replicates rapidly, usually before the disease can be diagnosed and treated. Marine free-living species of the genus Acanthamoeba do not grow as rapidly and, depending on the species, invade different sites. They enter the skin, lower respiratory tract, or nasopharynx, and the vegetative trophozoite can reach the CNS through the circulatory system. These acanthamebic infections may take weeks or months to cause death, and often infections occur in patients that are immunocompromised (unlike the otherwise healthy hosts that become ill due to PAM) but are still difficult to diagnose. Six different ameba species have also been associated with painful amebic keratitis, a difficult to treat corneal disease. Even though recognized in 1973, amebic keratitis was not common until 1985 when contact lenses became popular; these lenses typically are maintained overnight in a saline solution that can become a source of contamination.",

            "text": "Toxic waste products can trigger a reduction in host resistance, resulting in susceptibility to rapidly reproducing agents that would normally be held in check or not able to produce infections. The myxosporidian Henneguya gambusi infects the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, and is rare, not previously considered pathogenic, and not known from any other fish (Parker et al. 1971). We have also seen it in mosquitofish but only from a location in Mississippi receiving wastes from a timber treatment facility, involving the wood preservative chromated copper arsenate, a mixture of chromium, copper, and arsenic (as copper(II) arsenate) (Overstreet 1997). Presumably, the mosquitofish becomes infected from being in close contact with actinospores shed from a tubificid oligochaete. A small percentage of the few fish in the contaminated creek exhibited mass infection (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2), and it was typically histozoic with plasmodia throughout the skeletal muscle mixed with tissue debris not associated with an obvious inflammatory response rather than in pseudocysts located in the epidermis, corium, and subdermal connective tissue as originally described. A few of those fish from the wild had a severely pathogenic infection, with mature spores liberated from the plasmodia and spread into adjacent muscles, replacing most tissues throughout the body (e.g., Dykov\u00e1 and Lom 2007). However, when we collected 50 fish from this station and 50 from another station containing tubificids and then maintained them in aquaria in our laboratory and fed them commercial flakes daily, over half the fish from the contaminated location became moribund or died within 2 months. No fish from the other location died or appeared unhealthy. The moribund fish were sectioned or examined fresh and demonstrated the myxosporidian with its 10 by 6 \u03bcm spores invading most tissues throughout the samples. Representatives of live fish from both groups did not exhibit infection in section, and none of the remaining fish exhibited infection when critically examined as fresh. The contamination apparently reduced the host\u2019s protective immune response which would normally keep a low infection in check. Light infections had to be present in about half the fish from the contaminated location when brought into the laboratory, even though not evident in fresh or sectioned material. Under normal conditions, spores of all histozoic species occur in small to large pseudocysts, the latter containing millions of spores. When the plasmodium is extremely small or when few vegetative or spore individuals are present, an infection is difficult to see, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes are necessary to detect infections. In fact, the only person we have seen skilled enough to routinely detect minimal infections is Iva Dykov\u00e1 of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.\n\n",

The free-living organism, the ciliate Tetrahymena corlissi, has been reported from fish in aquaria and hatcheries, causing pathological alterations and mortality by Hoffman et al. (1975). They were unable to experimentally infect fish with the ciliate and suggested that infection resulted from a wound or stress. We (Overstreet et al. 1995) sampled the mosquitofish from an outlet canal from an integrated pulp and paper mill, 2.5 km upriver from the canal where water entering from a dam kept mill effluent from flowing upstream, and three downstream locations. Two of 99 fish from upstream, but none from the other locations, had a proliferation of the ciliate in the head and in the musculature, brachial chamber, and pericardial sac; that location also had fish with a significantly higher prevalence of macrophage aggregates in the spleen, a good indicator of stress. After publication, we learned of a long submerged pipe emptying toxic wastes upstream from our locations and originating from a nonrelated facility located several km from the river and apparently promoting the ciliate infection. Some ciliate specimens measured larger than those reported by Hoffman et al. (1975), but sequencing of presumed free-living ciliates infecting various aquatic hosts should allow identifications and experimentation to determine details of the mechanisms that shift a free-living organism to become a pathogenic one. For parasites or diseases of a host organism to be used as monitors of environmental health or biological activities, both the host and the symbionts or pathological responses need to fit several criteria (Overstreet 1997).",

Some cases are rare and others are common. A rare case consisted of finding the diatom Amphora sp., which normally is a free-living alga, in the white shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, presumably after the shrimp\u2019s carapace had been punctured or abraded. The diatom occurred in abundance as clusters in the hemolymph, plus some individuals were present in the gills associated with a melanistic response. The shrimp died. To test the effect of the related Amphora coffeaeformis on shrimp, Overstreet and Safford (1980) injected cultures into shrimp resulting in melanistic responses, but no extensive replication occurred as had been observed in the shrimp killed with Amphora sp. A more common opportunist is the fungus Fusarium solani, which also developed in penaeid shrimp. Farfantepenaeus californiensis, a species of penaeid initially being considered for aquaculture, is a highly susceptible species to this fungus. When experimentally infected with a cultured conidial suspension of this free-living species (Hose et al. 1984), all shrimp became infected within 14 days, tissue destruction and a strong but often unsuccessful hemocytic inflammatory response occurred, and over half of the shrimp died within 24 days. Biochemical and hemocytic parameters of the hemolymph changed significantly as the infection developed when compared with noninfected shrimp. When Farfantepenaeus aztecus or Litopenaeus setiferus was held in seawater with macroconidia spores cultured from an infection from Farfantepenaeus californiensis or injected with those spores, resistance to infection occurred. A strong hemocytic encapsulation and melanization of the macroconidia and lysis of the conidiospores occurred in the gills by 28 h. If spore dosage was excessive, 3.2 \u00d7 106 or greater, all brown shrimp died within 24 h from the macroconidia and hyphae blocking the distal portion of the gill lamellae (Solangi and Lightner 1976). In Litopenaeus vannamei, the primary cultured penaeid today, naturally infected individuals in culture are moderately susceptible to infection and the spore aggregate, often grossly apparent in the distal portion of the eyestocks; Penaeus monodon, which used to be the primary commercially cultured species, is relatively resistant (Lightner 1996). For pathogenicity by free-living algae and fungi, the triggering factor seems to be a wound or being compromised by other infectious agents or toxicants, but, as pointed out, the host species is also critical.",

Cultured specimens enter male but not female sea stars, probably through the gonopores, where it enters the testes and feeds on sperm of fully mature individuals only (Stickle et al. 2007). It has been reported from several sea star species and may have been inadvertently introduced into the Northeast Pacific region in the late 1980s (Boom, in Bates et al. 2010). Recently, Small et al. (2013) determined using ITS (internal transcribed spacer) sequences and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analyses that the histophagous ciliate infecting the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, in research facilities in Virginia and previously thought to be Mesanophrys chesapeakensis was actually O. stellarum. The same or similar infectious ciliate was probably responsible for histophagous disease in wild and captive blue crabs in Mississippi (Shields and Overstreet 2007), penaeid shrimps in Mississippi, and the wild lined shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, from Carpinteria Salt Marsh, California, that we examined for Ryan F. Hechinger, University of California, Santa Barbara. This infection spreads in the partially closed circulatory system of the decapod (McGaw 2005) from the hemolymph to muscle, visceral organs, and other tissues (Figs. 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6), usually killing the host. It has been assumed to enter into wounds of its hosts and now shown by Miller et al. (2013) to cause rapidly developing fatal infections in the blue crab inoculated with the ciliate or exposed to ciliates after experimental autonomy. When exposed to ciliates and not wounded, the crab seldom died. For comparisons, the fiddler crab Uca minax was inoculated with doses of either 10 or over 500 ciliates per crab, and crabs with 10 sometimes established infections, but those with the higher doses developed them rapidly. The infections developed at 10\u201315 \u00b0C, and ciliates were attracted to blue crab serum over other nutrient sources, suggesting the facultative nature of a blue crab parasite.\n\n\n\n",

Some may be involved in other mouth or gingival infections as pericoronitis or inflammation of the gums around molar teeth. However, if they are introduced into the bloodstream from surgical or other lesions, they have the potential of causing endocarditis, especially in individuals with damaged heart valves.

The bothriocephalid Anantrum tortum, a long, up to over 15 cm, cestode, twists either singly or in groups of up to eight, within the intestine of its relatively small fish host, Synodus foetens (inshore lizardfish). It can occur near the pyloric ceca, along the intestine, or near the anus of the samples, measuring up to 300 mm long. Overstreet (1968) detected a 99 % level of significance over a 2-year period between the monthly prevalence of worms located near the anus and water temperature. Salinity was held constant, and an inverse sine transformation was applied to the percentage data. This anal location favors loss of the worm during warm weather, possibly assisting probability of best completing life cycle, but to be expelled, the lizardfish appears to have needed a several-mm-long packet of prey fish scales with a diameter much greater than that of the intestine. The carnivorous lizardfish can eat fishes and shrimps larger than itself. Consequently, fish prey with large scales tends to be advantageous for the lizardfish to rid itself of the parasite.",

In the case of metazoans, a host can come into contact with an especially high, unnatural dose of infective agents such as thousands of cercariae killing an intermediate host well before the corresponding metacercariae develop (e.g., Overstreet and Curran 2004). Intermediate hosts under specific conditions can be heavily infected simultaneously with several parasitic species. Some parasites such as microphallid trematodes infect a variety of birds and mammals. Therefore, a bird could acquire a harmful infection by feeding on individual heavily infected intermediate hosts, or source communities (Bush et al. 1993).",

Those experimentally infected demonstrated a variety of abnormalities, including asynchronous development, degeneration of early developmental stages, formation of macrophage aggregates, and a granulomatous inflammatory response, especially one exhibiting liver destruction in Fundulus olivaceus and Rivulus marmoratus.

Species of the ascaridoid genus Goezia typically embed in an encapsulated ulcer in the wall as well as free in the lumen of the stomach of their natural fish hosts. These associations are described by Deardorff and Overstreet (1980a) for the nematode species Goezia pelagia in the cobia, Rachycentron canadum, and the Atlantic spadefish, Chaetodipterus faber, as well as for Goezia minuta in the gafftopsail catfish, Bagre marinus; the hardhead catfish, Ariopsis felis; and the inshore lizardfish, Synodus foetens. In none of these hosts does there appear to be any significant harm associated with the presence of the nematode (Deardorff and Overstreet 1980a). However, when the introduced host species such as the blue tilapia, Oreochromis aureus; striped bass, Morone saxatilis; and hybrid striped bass become infected with Goezia sinamora, the nematode produces massive fibrotic nodules in the fish stomach, and the nematode can also cause mortality. Goezia sinamora was implicated in mortality of hatchery-reared striped bass and tilapia introduced into a series of lakes in Florida, including Lake Parker [Gaines and Rogers 1972, see correction by Deardorff and Overstreet (1980a)]. In the tilapia, this roundworm has been observed to migrate through the intestinal wall, causing extensive lesions, in addition to forming nodules in the stomach. When the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and other native species of fish were exposed to this nematode, the resulting infections contained relatively few of the roundworms and demonstrated no conspicuous harmful effect (Deardorff and Overstreet 1980a).",

(2009), Adamo (2012), Adamo and Webster (2013)] have reported on parasite infections resulting in virulence, evolutionary, and behavioral changes in intermediate hosts such that the intermediate host has a better opportunity to be preyed upon by the appropriate definitive host than by chance alone. Whereas these changes are not necessarily triggers that make an agent more pathogenic, they often are changes that reflect the point at which the undeveloped, noninfective agent becomes infective to the definitive host and pathogenic to the intermediate host. A good example is the microphallid trematode Levinseniella byrdi, which infects the intestinal ceca of a few bird species such as the seaside sparrow, clapper rail, willet, and semipalmated sandpiper. These birds acquire the infection from one of a few talitrid amphipods such as Uhlorchestia uhleri from salt marshes of Texas to North Carolina and Uhlorchestia spartinophilia in a similar habitat from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to central Maine. In the Gulf of Mexico, the metacercaria also occurs in the amphipod species Orchestia grillus and Chelorchestia forceps (Bousfield and Heard 1986). The dramatic modification in the amphipod usually occurs after about a month, once the metacercaria becomes infective. At this point, the host amphipod turns from greenish or grayish to a translucent or bright orange (Fig. 2.7). The infected amphipod also unusually slows down its movements and, in contrast to its uninfected, negatively phototactic cohorts, does not always hide under wracks of dead, dissociated leaves and stems of spartina grass or other of their dietary debris shelters. Apparently, the amphipod carotenoids become unbound from protein of the infected host, allowing the bird host to be preferentially attracted to the now brightly colored amphipods containing infective metacercariae (Bousfield and Heard 1986). Johnson et al. (2009) experimentally manipulated a few tidal salt marsh creeks in Plum Island Estuary, Massachusetts, by nutrient fertilizer enrichment and exclusion of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog), a primary predator in the system. Interaction of the two treatments reduced abundance of the common Uhlorchestia spartinophilia, and apparently infected amphipods moved from the marsh edge to the adjoining creek-wall habitats during 1 year, resulting in 97 % of the amphipods clinging on the creek walls and exhibiting the bright orange. A subsample of the colored amphipods was confirmed to be infected, and they were seen being fed upon by the semipalmated sandpiper and seaside sparrow.\n",

A similar situation has been noted to occur where Levinseniella tasmaniae but not other microphallids induced an orangish color in the amphipod Austrochiltonia australis in Tasmania (Smith 1981). That is not to say all species of Levinseniella induce coloration and other modifications in their amphipod hosts since Levinseniella tridigitata does not modify Gammarus aequicauda (see Thomas et al. 1996) and Levinseniella carteretensis (or Levinseniella hunteri) does not induce a color change in any of the five talitrids, including U. uhleri, when experimentally infected (Bousfield and Heard 1986, Heard personal communication). Another trigger involves photoreception. The snail host typically sheds large quantities of cercariae of Levinseniella tasmaniae infective for the amphipod host when under light conditions, whether natural or experimentally reversed (Smith 1981). And yet, cercariae of other species are shed during dark or other physical conditions.",

            "text": "The relationships between termites or related insects and their symbionts are numerous and provide examples of an abundance of triggers, including diet, to control the various relationships. Some of these involving termites will be discussed elsewhere by David Bignell (Volume 2, Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-28170-4_6 of this series). Investigations by L. R. Cleveland (e.g., 1926) were designed to better understand symbiosis using termites and their intestinal flagellates. He was well aware that bacteria and yeasts were involved in the relationships and that there was a fine line separating where one symbiotic association ended and the other began. For example, when one agent in a so-called mutualistic relationship could survive without the host, it nevertheless also can become a parasite living off the host. This situation, however, is complicated and difficult to assess. He tried to remove one or more flagellate microorganisms from a host without harm to the host so that the association could be manipulated. He also thought it best to consider all components, which he defined differently than we do (he considered a commensal association to be one when neither party was benefited nor injured), of an association as symbionts. Depending on a specific termite host, he could void the flagellates with starvation, a high temperature not lethal to the host, a specific level of moisture, and oxygen under pressure. For example, by oxygenating the large Pacific Coast termite (Zootermopsis nevadensis) for 7 h at 1.5 atm, two (Leidyopsis sphaerica and Trichonympha campanula) of the four flagellates survived, and the host lived \u201cindefinitely.\u201d Additionally, starving the termite at the above conditions for 6 days left only one flagellate (L. sphaerica), showing that both L. sphaerica and the termite do together constitute a necessary and mutualistically beneficial symbiotic relationship. Without any flagellates but with a diet of wood, the termite lived for about 3 weeks. Reintroducing either L. sphaerica or T. campanula allowed the termite to experience its normal much longer longevity (usually 60\u201370 days). Cleveland realized that the presence of the other two flagellates (Trichomonas termopsidis and Streblomastix strix, both having a poorly understood symbiosis with epibiotic bacteria) in the termite starved for 8 days would help the termite survive for about 10 weeks but were not necessary symbionts; he realized that bacteria played a role in digesting the diet. The \u201cprimitive\u201d termite Mastotermes darwiniensis from Australia was studied by Li et al. (2003), and it had in its hindgut six flagellates, none of which can yet be cultured. Historically, these flagellates were considered to use their digestive enzymes to digest cellulose for the benefit of the termite. However, they determined using PCR technology that the main endoglucanase activity in the flagellates appears to originate from termite cellulases produced in the salivary glands. At least two of the flagellates possess their own endoglucanase genes, which are expressed but without significant enzyme activity in their nutritive vacuole. After millions of years of evolution, these flagellates, suggested by Li et al. (2003), are heading for a secondary loss of their own endoglucanases to exclusive use of the termite cellulases. Feeding on the symbionts still seems to be an important nutritional component of the termite diet.",

            "text": "Some termites, such as those which are soil-feeders, depend entirely on bacterial symbionts (Bignell et al. 1980). This association, often involved with coprophagy, feeding on fecal pellets containing termite bacteria that digest the cellulose, will be treated by D. E. Bignell elsewhere in this series (Volume 2, Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-28170-4_6). Other termites, such as members of the Macrotermitinae, depend on a relationship with mutualistic fungal symbionts of the genus Termitomyces, which form fungal combs in the nests. These and attine ants can produce nests that often are thousands of liters in volume, able to persist for decades, and contain millions of sterile helper individuals usually resulting as offspring from a single queen. Those termites are major decomposers of the Old World tropics, and the ants are dominant herbivores of the New World tropics. The fungal symbionts of the termites can produce sexual fruiting bodies allowing their horizontal acquisition, but those of the attine ants rarely fruit and are typically propagated clonally and vertically by the dispersing queens. The life cycles of the fungus are again shown to help trigger different symbiotic relationships. Aanen et al. (2002) present phylogenies of the termites (about 330 species in 11 genera) and their fungal symbionts which number about 40 and are shared by different termite species. They show significant congruence between the termite and fungal phylogenies because the interactions at higher taxonomic levels show considerable specificity. They also considered the trait of biparental colony founding to constrain evolution of vertical symbiont transmission in termites, where the male survives and mates repeatedly with the female for life but not in ants where males die after a single mating. The Formosan subterranean termite pest (Coptotermes formosanus) builds a large nest with spongelike networks of intricate feces-lined tunnels (carton material). Fungal pathogenic agents are used, usually unsuccessfully, to kill the termite. Studies by Chouvenc et al. (2013) have shown that environmental conditions within termite nests promote the growth of Actinobacteria, whose presence in turn seems to protect the termite colony against fungal entomopathogens, including Metarhizium anisopliae. In other words, the Actinobacteria, which represented a nonnutritional exosymbiosis in the termite, was a defensive mutualism that increased survival of the termite and was additive to the termite\u2019s individual immunity and social defensive capacity, which in turn increased survival of the termite.",

Even with antibiotics, we obtained BP infections with associated catastrophic mortalities when the shrimp larvae were exposed to the virus. After hybridization crosses of shrimp and introducing special wild brood stock, the result was creation of shrimp stocks with improved resistance to BP, and we noted as a bonus our having created crosses exhibiting resistance to other microbial agents.

All groups PL9 or younger became heavily infected within 2\u20135 days, some experiencing high mortalities compared with controls. Surviving postlarvae had reduced growth as determined by dry weight. One of these groups was cultured for an additional 49 days, and the smaller postlarvae that survived the infection appeared similar to the controls after 4 weeks by which time viral prevalence had decreased. Exposure of the virus to older postlarvae produced a high prevalence of infection but with little effect on either survival or growth. When 13- to 14-day-old postlarvae in similar size groups of previously infected and noninfected individuals were starved for 10 days, less than 2 % of the infected postlarvae survived the 10-day period compared with 52 % of the noninfected ones.

The postlarvae exposed when 3-days-old (PL3) exhibited infections in 77 % of those examined at 5 days postinfection (PI) and in 100 % of the same group when examined at day 9 compared with 0 % prevalence in the controls; 14 % of the shrimp that were exposed when postlarvae for 39 days (PL39) had developed an infection at day 9 PI when 20 % of those exposed as PL63s exhibited infections; and the prevalence in the latter group increased to 42 % at day 14. With the exception of one shrimp exposed when a PL120, none developed an observable infection at 19 days, and only 2 of 20 of the exposed PL157 group examined at day 16 exhibited an infection. No control became infected. Other experiments also showed this decrease in prevalence as well as intensity of infection and mortality with age. In general, most postlarvae 12 days old or older did not become infected, and those that became infected did not die.

            "text": "The nutritional condition of Litopenaeus vannamei can be assessed biochemically in terms of available energy reserve. The principal energy storage materials in the penaeid shrimp are lipids and proteins, with carbohydrates considered to be a minor energy reserve. Triacylglycerol (TAG), an ester derived from glycerol, and three fatty acids serve as the primary classes of lipid used for energy storage. In patent infections of BP conducted by Stuck et al. (1996), the polyhedra first appeared in the HP 18\u201324-h postexposure with a maximal infection usually occurring at 72 h (also see Hammer et al. 1998); however, progression of the infection after the initial appearance of the polyhedra was variable among shrimp potentially corresponding with different levels of body lipid used for energy storage. We measured preinfection and postinfection TAG and protein levels during a series of experimental BP exposures using shrimp from a variety of sources with different inherent protein and TAG levels. Mysis-stage or early post-larval protein levels measured either preexposure or postexposure to BP showed no consistent relationship with BP infections. However, a viral prevalence of 86\u2013100 % occurred at 72 h when initial TAG levels measured above 3.5 \u03bcg/mg in contrast to 35 % or less in shrimp when initial TAG levels <2.0 \u03bcg/mg. TAG levels in mysis stage-1 larva rose rapidly from 1 to about 11 \u03bcg/mg in 2 days for both infected and negative control populations, then dipped to about 2 \u03bcg/mg at day 9, and subsequently again rose in both populations but was about 3 \u03bcg/mg higher in the infected shrimp at day 15. Most shrimp died before the end of a week. Two other experiments starting with 9-day postlarvae (PL9s) were conducted when initial TAG levels were either about 1 or 7 \u03bcg/mg, and substantial mortalities did not occur in either. All individuals in the infected groups became infected, at about day 10 in the initial low TAG group and at day 3 in the initial high group. In the initial low TAG group, the TAG level of the infected group stayed about the same at day 20, but that of the control groups increased to about 4 \u03bcg/mg. In contrast, in the initial high TAG experiment in which the TAG level for both infected and control groups dipped from 7 to about 1.5 \u03bcg/mg at day 3, the level increased to about 10 \u03bcg/mg at day 20 and about 15 \u03bcg/mg at day 25. Stress caused by starving postlarvae (PL18s) reduced TAG but not protein reserves. Detection of the BP infection was delayed for 30 h when the group to be infected was starved for 48 h compared with continuously fed controls, but the prevalence of infection in both groups increased rapidly to similar high prevalence values above 80 % between 72 and 192 h PI.",

All but the high \u00d7 low-growth offspring, with a 68 % prevalence of infection, had an 88\u2013100 % prevalence at day 4. The low \u00d7 low-growth cross of 3-month-old shrimp fed the virus IHHNV (infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus, which has been classified as Penaeus stylirostris densovirus) exhibited the highest prevalence (48 %) at 30 days compared with the lowest (6 %) in the high \u00d7 low-growth cross. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymorphisms for the four crosses showed no clear relationship between the prevalence values of IHHNV and BP. Even with similar mtDNA haplotypes included in the initial crosses, the offspring of those crosses exhibited major differences in both steady-state levels and patterns of expression of mitochondrial 12s rRNA at various early developmental stages of the resulting offspring of the different crosses.

In nature, this condition is seldom recognized because only microscopic-sized larvae and early postlarvae usually die from the infection, dead animals cannot be seen because they are small or readily eaten, and the opportunity for the agent and the larvae to come into close proximity is relatively rare. In aquaculture, the virus and larvae can and do come into contact. Hatcheries in the multibillion-dollar shrimp industry have prompted research to solve the previous major threat that collapsed hatcheries in the USA and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere during the early days of the industry when brood stock was obtained from the wild. The related MBV in the Eastern Hemisphere also caused a similar major problem. Now that the industry can rear most penaeid species; detect BP and other infectious agents with PCR, gene probes, and other methods in routine monitoring; produce its own brood stock relative to disease resistance and growth potential; and accommodate ambient temperatures, infections of BP in aquaculture are rare. If they do occur, an entire spawn can be destroyed and disposed and the system decontaminated, and there would be a time loss of only a few days before a new spawn could be produced.",

Most of the presently known 25 or so shrimp viruses cause mortality in subadult animals that have been reared for a few months. The high cost of feed and labor plus the relatively long animal growing period results in a high economic cost. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the costs of an inability to quickly replace the entire infected pond-reared adult or subadult stock as can be done for larvae in hatcheries infected with BP infections.

Although this does not mean that the total number of shrimp in the world doubled (not all of the shrimp in the world were captured), it does suggest that aquaculture substantially increased the total number of penaeid shrimp in the world and continues to do so. It is also clear that the increased number of aquacultured shrimp were at higher densities than wild shrimp. This increased population size and density are conducive to the spread of infectious diseases.",

Facultative symbionts, such as entomophagous nematodes, are both free living and symbiotic (Sudhaus 2008). The adaptation of being symbiotic is that it increases the habitat breadth of the symbiont, and inhabitation of a living organism removes the organism from competition with other organisms encountered living freely in the habitat. Thereby, the relationship allows the symbiont an escape from competition. So that may be the reason for a life history strategy in which both symbiotic and free-living phases exist.

It is calculated as the mean life span of an infection times the number of transmissions (equivalent to births) that would occur over that infectious period (Mollison 1995). It is very much the population growth rate of an infection and is analogous to the net reproductive rate (R\n0) of free-living organisms.

However, there often occurs a trade-off between transmission and virulence. For example, in the case of TSV, the greater the load or intensity of the virus in a shrimp host, the greater the transmission (\u03b2 increases). However, the greater the viral intensity, the greater the chance of mortality of the host (\u03b1 increases) (Lotz 2010). Therefore, the trade-off is mediated by viral intensity. As a result, a balance exists between infectivity and virulence, and the maximum R\n0 is obtained at intermediate levels of virulence (Fig. 2.13). This much of the theory assumes that the source of new infections is living infected hosts and that the death of the host ends infectivity (Ewald 1994; Hochberg 1998). What if transmission occurs not so much from living infected hosts but from hosts after they die? This is likely to be the case for several shrimp pathogens. Soto and Lotz (2001) and Lotz et al. (2003) demonstrated for WSSV and for TSV that transmission from dead infected shrimp is considerably greater than from living infected shrimp. This indicates that the transmissibility of a shrimp pathogen does not end with the life of the shrimp.\n",

In this case, the load does not affect the time of infectivity of a dead infected shrimp, and the trade-off between load and time of infectivity disappears. In fact, increased virulence in live infected hosts causes a high pathogen load in dead animals and therefore increased infectivity of dead hosts without affecting the time of infectivity. So as virulence increases, R\n0 also increases, and we expect virulence to increase over time if transmission is from dead shrimp (Fig. 2.13). Lotz (2010) did not consider the outcome if both living and dead hosts contribute; however, overall R\n0 is \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{a}}}{\\alpha }+\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\delta } $$\\end{document}\u03b2a\u03b1+\u03b2d\u03b4, where \u03b2\na is the transmission rate from a living host, \u03b2\nd is the transmission rate from dead hosts, \u03b1 is the virulence of a pathogen to the living hosts, and \u03b4 is the infectivity decay of a dead infected host.

Although the above reasoning and Fig. 2.13 have been applied specifically to TSV and living and dead shrimp, they apply more generally to any two states that contribute to an overall R\n0. The two states instead can be two habitats or two species of host. The state (habitat or species) that contributes the greatest to R\n0 will dominate setting the optimal virulence. For species of symbiont that have both free-living and symbiotic relationships, the free-living habitat will contribute to the net reproductive rate (R\n0), and the symbiotic habitat will contribute to the basic reproduction number (R\n0). The two R\n0s contribute to the overall growth (and thereby fitness) of the symbiont. If the two states represent different host species, then the host species that is responsible for the greatest contribution to the basic reproduction number will predominate. The conclusion is that what happens in the lesser contributing state will not be as important, and therefore very high virulence could be obtained in a host with little contribution to fitness of the symbiont. The observed virulence is a coincidental by-product of the adaptation to other habitats (Brown et al. 2012; Adiba et al. 2010). In particular, for some human bacterial pathogens, it has been postulated that bacterial pathogenicity evolved from antipredator selection by free-living bacteria and their predatory protists (Br\u00fcssow 2007; Adiba et al. 2010; Brown et al. 2012; Erken et al. 2013).",
