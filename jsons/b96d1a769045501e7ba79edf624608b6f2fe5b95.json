            "text": "The causes of MAKI in malaria may be multifactorial: 1. Shock leading to hypotension and reduced renal perfusion. 2. Intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria (black water fever) often associated with use of antimalarial drugs such as quinine, halofantrine, or me fl oquine. 3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and rhabdomyolysis are rare causes. 4. Antimalarial drugs may precipitate hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-de fi cient individuals resulting in hemoglobinuria and AKI. Renal Pathophysiology : The predominant lesions are acute tubular necrosis, mild proliferative glomerulopathy, and varying degrees of interstitial nephritis. P . falciparum is associated with alteration in red cell surface structure resulting in increased cytoadherence to vascular endothelial cells and red cell sequestration, which in turn interferes with microcirculatory fl ow with subsequent multiorgan involvement. In severe hemolysis, vacuolization of proximal tubular cells and hemoglobin deposition in tubules are seen. Immuno fl uorescence shows mesangial C3 and IgM deposition. EM shows subendothelial and mesangial electron-dense deposits with granular, fi brillar, and amorphous material. Immune complexes of malarial antigen can be present in the glomerular basement membrane. Diagnosis : Blood smear examination using thick and thin smears stained with Giemsa stain revealing the presence of asexual forms of P . falciparum is diagnostic. Staining with the fl uorescent dye acridine orange increases sensitivity. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that detect the presence of P . falciparum -speci fi c antigens are also in use.",

Shock leading to prerenal AKI. 2. Hemoglobinuria due to hemolysis and myoglobinuria due to rhabdomyolysis. 3. DIC with fi brin thrombi in the glomeruli leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a hemolytic-uremic syndrome-like picture. 4. Direct nephrotoxicity of the venom. 5. Sepsis and hypersensitivity to antivenom are rare causes.Renal Pathophysiology : Snake venoms can cause cellular injury through enzymes and cytokines and initiate a sepsis-like process. AKI can occur due to shock or due to intravascular hemolysis (hemotoxic snake) or rhabdomyolysis (myotoxic snake).Renal Histopathology : Renal biopsy and histology can show a varied picture: 1. Tubulointerstitial: most common; degeneration of tubular cells, necrosis, interstitial in fi ltrates, and edema. 2. Glomerular: focal segmental mesangial proliferation, areas of necrosis, thrombosis, and mesangiolysis. IF may show IgM and C3 deposits occasionally. 3. Cortical necrosis: necrosis of all elements with thrombi in the vessels. 4. Vascular: segmental necrotizing vasculitis.Treatment : Management includes speci fi c antivenom treatment; monovalent antivenoms are preferred over polyvalent. In situations where antivenom is not available, plasmapheresis or blood exchange has been used. Early and frequent peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is important for survival. Urine alkalinization has a role if there is pigmenturia or if the snake is known to be myotoxic/hemotoxic and renal failure is not yet established. Caution is necessitated as administration of sodium bicarbonate in the setting of acute renal failure can be dangerous, leading to further fl uid overload and hyperosmolality. ",
