            "text": "Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a major diagnostic tool for infectious lung diseases, especially in immunocompromised patients [1]. Viral agents play an important role as etiologies of pneumonia in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts [2\u20135], and may be involved in a substantial proportion of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [6\u20139]. The development of molecular biology techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has dramatically increased the yield of viral tests for various respiratory diseases [2, 4, 5, 8]. However, most studies have been performed in specific settings, with highly selected patients. Hence, the yield of viral tests on BAL fluid (BALF) remains poorly characterized in routine practice. A key dilemma with the development of new tests is the relatively high cost associated with their non-discriminated use. To better inform the use of viral tests in patients with respiratory diseases, we performed an observational, retrospective study in our institution, with three aims: (i) to assess the diagnostic value of viral tests on BALF in routine practice; (ii) to analyze the characteristics of patients with virus-positive BALF; and (iii) to identify the factors predictive of positive viral tests in BALF.",

BALF specimens were aliquoted and immediately transported to laboratories. Appropriate staining was carried out for the direct identification of bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites. Cultures for bacterial identification were inoculated under standard aerobic conditions on four different media, as well as on specific media for Mycobacterium spp., when indicated. For the usual respiratory pathogens, the bacterial count was considered to be significant when quantitative culture yielded >103 CFU/mL of specimen. In addition, tests for atypical pneumonia agents were performed at the request of the physician in charge, on BALF (i.e., PCR, immunofluorescence, specific staining, and culture on appropriate media) and by serology.",

The sample was mixed (volume 1:1) with viral transport medium, i.e., minimum essential medium enriched with sorbitol (70 %), bovine serum albumin, streptomycin, vancomycin, colimycin, and amphotericin B. BALF was first analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), A and B influenza viruses, 1\u20133 parainfluenza viruses, and adenovirus, as well as herpes simplex viruses (HSV)-1 and -2, in immunocompromised patients. In parallel, BALF was inoculated onto MRC-5 and LLC-MK2 monolayer cells, and also onto MDCK cells during the influenza season. In immunocompromised patients, an immunocytochemistry (ICC) for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed. The detection of viral genomes was carried out according to the clinical context and a request from the physician in charge. HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 were detected using a commercial method (Herpes Consensus\u00ae, Arg\u00e8ne, France). In addition, CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV, HHV-6, and influenza A and B were detected with in-house PCR, adapted from previously described methods [13]. Neither PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab/aspirates nor viral serology tests were routinely performed during the study period in our institution.",

ICU patients with virus-positive BALF were more likely to be treated than non-ICU-patients with virus-positive BALF (70 % vs. 30 %, p = 0.015). There was no significant association between antiviral treatment and outcome in patients with virus-positive BAL.",

Of the 232 consecutive BALF tested for viruses, 70 (30 %) were positive. Previous studies have estimated the diagnostic yield of viral tests from BALF in different settings, and the proportion of virus-positive BALF ranged from 14 to 49.5 %, depending on the population studied (e.g., immunocompromised, ICU patients) and the viral techniques used (e.g., PCR, ICC, IF, culture) [2\u20135, 14, 15]. A broad range of respiratory diseases have been associated with viral infections. Hence, testing for viruses in BALF may be considered in patients with a wide spectrum of clinical and radiological abnormalities [16, 17]. However, our study suggests that viral tests are unlikely to return positive except in two, non-exclusive, situations: (i) immunocompromised patients; (ii) bilateral ground-glass attenuations on CT scan.",

            "text": "In this study, the vast majority of viruses detected belong to the Herpesviridae family, mainly HSV-1 (38.6 % of all virus-positive BALF) and CMV (33 %), as previously described by Garbino et al. in unselected hospitalized patients [14]. Respiratory viruses were found in only five cases out of the 232 BALF investigated: RSV (n = 3), rhinovirus (n = 1), and adenovirus (n = 1), representing only a small proportion (7.1 %) of virus-positive BALF. This low prevalence of respiratory viruses may be related to the sub-optimal selection of cases where these tests were performed in our institution during the study period. In addition, the absence of any influenza diagnostic in BALF may be explained by the low intensity of seasonal flu in France during the study year (2008) and by the preferential use of PCR tests on nasopharyngeal aspirates when the diagnosis of influenza is suspected. Multiple studies performed in the ICU have identified herpes viruses, mainly HSV and CMV, in patients with VAP. HSV-1 has been found in 16\u201362 % of patients under mechanical ventilation for >5 days (median, 7 days) [18\u201320]. Luyt et al. documented an HSV-related cyto-pathogenic effect, with intra-nuclear inclusions in 20 % of VAP in patients ventilated for a median duration of 14 days [20]. CMV replication was observed in the plasma of one-third of CMV-seropositive patients with VAP after 4\u201312 days of mechanical ventilation, and lung involvement was documented by CMV-related cyto-pathogenic effect in 5\u201330 % of patients [21\u201323]. All these studies found that HSV and CMV in BALF are associated with increased morbidity and/or mortality. However, the causal relationship between HSV or CMV in BALF and patient outcomes cannot be ascertained from these observational studies.",

Multiplex PCR tests, with their ability to detect several viruses in one set, may be particularly interesting in the diagnostic workup of acute respiratory diseases suspected to be of viral origin [24\u201326]. In our study, the diagnostic yield of viral tests would have dropped from 30 to 20 %, had PCR tests not been performed. This advocates for the systematic use of PCR techniques for viral tests in BALF, in accordance with previous studies [27, 28], in the situations where viruses may reasonably be suspected (i.e., acute lower tract respiratory disease in immunocompromised patients and/or patients with unexplained bilateral ground-glass attenuations on CT scan). On the other hand, the initial assessment of immunocompetent patients with interstitial lung disease should not include any viral test on BALF, as previously reported in 40 patients with interstitial fibrosis [29]. During the exacerbation of idiopathic fibrosis, viral tests on BALF may be of higher value, although recent papers have questioned their clinical significance [29, 30].",

            "text": "This study has limitations related to its retrospective, monocentric, and observational design, as investigations on BALF were not protocolized, and the request for viral testing was left to the discretion of the physician in charge. Firstly, the retrospective review of medical charts identified a significant proportion of patients who were unlikely to suffer from viral infections, and for whom viral tests should not have been performed. In contrast, among patients not included in this study as no viral test was requested, there probably were patients who would have benefited from viral tests on BALF. However, the comparison of the 212 patients who had BALFs tested for viruses in 2008 and a random selection of 40 patients who had BALF samples not tested for viruses during the same year found that the only significant differences were immunodepression (10 % vs. 83 %, p < 0.0001) and ground-glass attenuations on CT scan (23 % vs. 74 %, p < 0.0001). This suggests that clinicians are aware of the situations most likely to be associated with the presence of viruses, and that they appropriately select the patients in whom viral tests are more likely to return positive. Lastly, PCR was performed in only 149 of 232 BALF investigated for viruses. More systematic use of PCR tests in these patients may have increased the proportion of viruses identified. Secondly, the identification of virus in BALF during the diagnostic workup of a respiratory disease does not systematically imply that the virus is responsible for the disease and that the patient will improve with appropriate antiviral treatment. Despite these limitations, this observational study allowed us to identify categories of respiratory diseases where viral tests are very unlikely to return positive (e.g., initial assessment of immunocompetent patients with interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary micronodules). As a consequence, indications for viral tests in BALF were dramatically reduced for these patients in our institution. In conclusion, testing for viruses on BALF should be mostly restricted to acute lower tract respiratory disease in immunocompromised patients and/or patients with unexplained ground-glass attenuations on CT scan, especially when PCR tests are used.",
