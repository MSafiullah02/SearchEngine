            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine with complicated roles in tumor progression and antitumor immunity (Oft, 2014). IL-10 could suppress the expression of MHC class II and CD80/CD86 in antigen-presenting cells (Hashimoto et al., 2001), and promote alternative activation of macrophages (Nakamura et al., 2015). IL-10 could also limit the extent of inflammation by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from T cells and macrophages (Ouyang et al., 2011). These functions of IL-10 might suppress antitumor immunity but were essential for the suppression of tumor-promoting inflammation (Oft, 2014). IL-10-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells and macrophages was critical to the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease, a common preceding event to colorectal cancer (Mager et al., 2016). Interestingly, several recent studies indicated that IL-10 also promoted antitumor immunity through proinflammatory actions. IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice succumbed to more rapid tumor metastasis with a lack of intratumor expansion of CD8+ T cells and reduced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Mumm et al., 2011). Injection of pegylated IL-10 significantly elevated the levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and granzymes in tumor (Mumm et al., 2011, Mumm and Oft, 2013). In addition, IL-10 was required for the activation of tumor-resident, but not lymph node-resident, CD8+ T cells (Emmerich et al., 2012). Together, these partially contrasting results suggest that the role of IL-10 in tumor is likely context-dependent.",

It is well understood that the immune system plays a crucial role in the prognosis of breast cancer (Standish et al., 2008), but the exact mechanism underlying its pathology is still unknown. Like in other tumors, the role of IL-10 in breast cancer is also unclear. Breast cancer patients tended to present elevated serum IL-10 (Hamidullah Changkija and Konwar, 2012). The significance of the correlation between IL-10 concentration and breast cancer prognosis was dependent on the patient cohort, types of treatment, and the location of IL-10, but most studies demonstrated that higher IL-10 levels were associated with worse disease status (Chavey et al., 2007, Hamidullah Changkija and Konwar, 2012). However, since breast cancer cells, but not normal breast tissues, directly expressed IL-10 (Chavey et al., 2007, Venetsanakos et al., 1997), the high IL-10 expression might be a result rather than the reason of cancer progression. Also, whether IL-10 could activate and expand tumor-resident CD8+ T cells is yet unclear in breast cancer.",

In this study, we found that IL-2 and IL-10 worked synergistically to enhance the survival and proliferation of activated CD8+ T cells, resulting in elevated overall cytotoxic response. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) counteracted this synergy, possibly by depleting the level of IL-2 in culture but did not directly suppress IL-2 synthesis. In breast tumor, the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was low but could be enhanced by exogenous IL-2 and IL-10.",

Both IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated anti-apoptotic function in CD8+ T cells (Liu et al., 2010, Oft, 2014). We first found that breast cancer patients presented elevated serum IL-2 and IL-10 levels than healthy individuals (Fig. 1\nA). To compare and contrast the roles of IL-2 and IL-10 on CD8+ T cell survival, CD4-depleted PBMCs from breast cancer individuals were unstimulated or stimulated through the T cell receptor (TCR) with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies, in the presence of no additional cytokine (None), additional IL-2 (+IL-2), additional IL-10 (+IL-10), or additional IL-2 and IL-10 (+IL-2 + IL-10). CD4+ T cells were depleted because they could secrete high amount of IL-2 and IL-10 and produce confounding results. The survival of CD8+ T cells was then examined (Fig. 1B). After short-term (24 h) incubation, no significant differences in the apoptosis level of CD8+ T cells among various treatment conditions were observed (Fig. 1C). However, after longer-term (72 h) incubation, in TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells, the addition of either IL-2 or IL-10 had suppressed the level of apoptosis, compared to those with no additional cytokine (Fig. 1C). When both IL-2 and IL-10 were added, the increase in the survival rate of TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells was higher than the increases in IL-2 alone and IL-10 alone combined. Interestingly, this effect was only observed in TCR-stimulated, but not unstimulated CD8+ T cells, as the viability in TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells presented lower viability than unstimulated CD8+ T cells when no additional cytokine was added (Fig. 1C).",

The long-term +IL-2 + IL-10 group demonstrated significantly elevated cytotoxicity compared to the short-term +IL-2 + IL-10 group. To investigate the increase in long-term cytotoxicity in +IL-2 + IL-10 T cells, we examined the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells in various cytokine treatments (Fig. 3\nA). IL-2 alone promoted the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells. While IL-10 alone did not significantly increase the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells, the IL-2 and IL-10 combined resulted in the highest frequency of dividing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3B).

However, the CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were shown to have crucial antiinflammatory properties in breast cancer (Curiel, 2007, Watanabe et al., 2010). Therefore, we decided to examine the actions of Treg cells on the effects of IL-2/IL-10 on CD8+ T cells. Foxp3 represents the canonical transcription factor for Treg cells. Foxp3+ T cells were concentrated in the CD25+ fraction of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4\nA and C). We fractionated total CD4+ T cells into CD25+ and CD25\u2212 fractions, with greater than 91.5% purity for the CD25+ fraction and 99% purity for the CD25\u2212 fraction (Fig. 4B and D). Each fraction was then added to the TCR-stimulated CD4-depleted PBMC culture, with additional IL-2 and IL-10. The addition of CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells did not significantly change the cytotoxicity or proliferation of IL-2 and IL-10-treated TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells, while addition of CD4+CD25+ Tregs significantly suppressed the cytotoxicity and proliferation of IL-2 and IL-10-treated TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5\nA\u2013C). We next investigated the effect of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells on the concentration of IL-2 and IL-10, and found that the addition of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells significantly reduced the concentration of IL-2 in a cell number-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). However, CD4+CD25+ Treg cells did not directly suppress the transcription of IL-2 mRNA in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5E). In addition, CD4+CD25+ Treg cells did not significantly change the concentration of IL-10 in culture or the transcription of IL-10 mRNA (Fig. 5D and 5E).",

            "text": "The immune system is involved in almost every step of tumor pathobiology. Chronic inflammations are angiogenic and tumor promoting, while cytotoxic immune responses are crucial to tumor surveillance and elimination. Growing amounts of evidence suggest that IL-10 is more than a regulatory cytokine in antitumor immune responses. Both the proinflammatory and antiinflammatory actions of IL-10 have been implicated in the development as well as the suppression of tumor. On the tumor-suppressing side, IL-10 inhibits Th17 inflammation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-23 enrichment, which could exert tumorigenic effects (Langowski et al., 2006). IL-10 also induces the activation and expansion of tumor-resident CD8+ T cells (Emmerich et al., 2012). On the tumor-promoting side, IL-10 is highly expressed in cancerous breast tissues but not the normal breast tissue, and is associated with higher grades of breast cancer in some studies (Chavey et al., 2007, Hamidullah Changkija and Konwar, 2012). These contrasting observations suggest that the precise role of IL-10 in cancer is context-dependent. In this study, we showed that the full antitumor capacity of IL-10 likely required the concurrent presence of IL-2. First, we found that after long-term TCR stimulation, the CD8+ T cells in breast cancer patients tended to undergo apoptosis, a phenomenon suppressible by IL-2 and/or IL-10 (Fig. 1). The cytotoxicity of TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells also tended to decrease over time, a trend that could be reverted by IL-2 and IL-10 (Fig. 2). IL-2 significantly increased the level of proliferation in TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells, while IL-10 did not (Fig. 3). Combining these results, IL-10 seemed to function primarily by improving the survival, but not the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells. A similar role of IL-10 was previously discovered in acute coronavirus-induced encephalitis, where highly activated CD8+ T cells transiently expressed IL-10 while maintaining their cytotoxic functionality (Trandem et al., 2011). Notably, the addition of IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated synergistic effects, because when both IL-2 and IL-10 were present, the improvement in CD8+ T cell survival, proliferation and cytotoxicity was higher than the sum of the improvements mediated by each individual cytokine. Furthermore, the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells presented low cytotoxicity and could be rescued by neither IL-2 nor IL-10 alone but by the combined effects of IL-2 and IL-10 (Fig. 6). Together, this study offered a possible explanation to the partially disagreeing observations regarding the role of IL-10 in cancer, that the specific outcome of IL-10 enrichment was dependent on IL-2. This study also suggested that a combination of IL-2 and IL-10 might be incorporated in future immunotherapies.",

In normal breast tissue resected together with the tumor, very few tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells could be recovered. Therefore, a \u201cnormal\u201d control was lacking in experiments performed on tumor-infiltrating T cells.
