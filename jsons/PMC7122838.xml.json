However, this immunostimulation can also have adverse effects.

The use of recombinant adenovirus for ASO delivery to target cells offers some advantages over other methods, such as selectivity to airway epithelium and prolonged expression of transfected ASO-encoding genes (>1 week following instillation). However, adenovirus-mediated gene delivery induces immune responses to adenovirus that preclude repeated applications and there are several safety concerns such as the potential for oncogenic transformation. Other recent approaches include the use of ribozymes (RNA enzymes) and siRNA. The use of ribozymes offers some advantages over \u2018traditional\u2019 antisense because these catalytic RNA molecules can recycle after inducing the cleavage of complementary mRNA cleavage and therefore appear to act more efficiently than DNA-based antisense.
