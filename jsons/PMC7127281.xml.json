            "text": "Approximately 370 million people around the world suffer from chronic liver infection with the HBV, a kind of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus (WHO, 2011). Patients are at especially high risk when their serum viral load is higher than 100,000 copies/ml according to a report by the REVEALHBV (risk evaluation of viral load elevation and associated liver disease/cancer-hepatitis B virus) group (Iloeje et al., 2006, Lee et al., 2002). It is therefore clinically desirable to develop a quantitative diagnostic method to provide a high-sensitivity genetic assay for routine checkups or even for self-monitoring at home. Although polymer chain reaction (PCR) (Carrino and Lee, 1995) has been used in many areas of biotechnology and serves as the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, it requires efficient control of thermal cycles and thus has higher instrumentation costs. PCR is also known to have errors caused by its hybridization mechanism (Cadwell and Joyce, 1992). There are currently many research efforts devoted to miniaturizing the thermal cycler for point-of-care applications (Cooney et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2011). However, PCR still requires hours of operating time to have enough end products for detection because of the limits of thermal transition rate and thermal conductivity (Zhang et al., 2004).",

Both methods are indirect detectors of amplification; both signals are proportional to the amount of produced DNA and the reaction time. Measurement of Mg2P2O7 turbidity has one advantage: a simulated chemical reaction can be used to obtain Mg2P2O7 for calibration purposes or internal quality verification without using real buffer medium and targeted DNA samples (Lee et al., 2008). However, LAMP detection by turbidimetry is limited by in-homogeneity of particle size, uneven spatial distribution, re-dissolution of Mg2P2O7 particles and turbid samples; these factors result in relatively low sensitivity in short reaction time (approximately 20 min). In addition, this posts even greater challenge for the detection of smaller reaction volumes with smaller reactant amounts, e.g., polymerase, dNTP, buffer medium and extracted samples. One way to bypass this limitation is to use the surface sensing method rather than the traditional volume sensing approaches.",

Its beam was collimated and polarized by a plano-convex lens set and polarizer on the incident arm. This collimated beam was aligned toward the PC prism at a 72\u00b0 angle of incidence. The reflected light intensity is affected by the dielectric property of the LAMP solution in the vicinity of the Au surface. Monitoring the changes in intensity of the reflected light gives a measure of the change in the refractive index and therefore a measure of the LAMP reaction. We have observed a difference of 3000 RU between the SPR signal maximum (3500 RU) and minimum (500 RU). A mechanical fixture with precision pins was constructed to hold the sensing cartridge at the desired position, allowing reflection and projection of the light to a CCD camera with a focused microlens (TV LENS 12MM 1: 1.4, Japan).

Results show that the linearity of the PC prism compares favorably with the linearity of the glass prism; both prisms have a good correlation coefficient (R\n2\n > 0.99). The response value (\u0394RU = 540.984) of the glass prism at 10% ethanol is slightly less than the response value (\u0394RU = 612.728) of the PC prism. This difference is caused by the amount of reflective light energy absorbed by Cr film, an adhesive layer between the glass and Au film. The LOD is approximately 0.08% with the glass prism and 0.07% with the PC prism. The refractive index of the ethanol solution was computed using the binary mixing rule (Tasic et al., 1992). We were able to calculate that 1 \u0394RU was equivalent to a change in refractive index of 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 with the glass prism and 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 with the PC prism.",

Fig. 4B shows the results of three repeated cycles between 25 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C. These results demonstrate the reversibility of SPR responses to temperature cycling. The \u0394RU changes are due to the temperature dependence of the refractive index of water. The difference of response values (\u0394RU) between 65 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C was 178 \u00b1 1.5 \u0394RU for the PC prism and 177 \u00b1 1.4 \u0394RU for the glass prism. The 50 nm Au film coated onto the PC prism performed similarly to the 50 nm Au film coated on the glass prism; the film did not detach from the prism with temperature variance, even though the thermal expansion coefficient of PC substrate (70.2 \u00d7 10\u22126\n \u00b0C\u22121) (Serini, 2000) is greater than that of glass substrate (approximately 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22126\n \u00b0C\u22121) (Brown, 2004). The difference of SPR responses between these two types of prisms was neglected. The time to increase temperature from 25 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C is approximately 5 min in our system. The 5-min temperature response time was used in a follow-up experiment. Since both prisms exhibit temperature-dependent changes in SPR measurements, it remains important to maintain a stable temperature for LAMP detection by SPR, stable temperature is necessary for LAMP detection by SPR.",

The SPR response is sensitive to temperature-induced refractive index changes in the micro-reactor. This approach can minimize fluctuations caused by environmental factors and thus provide better discrimination of the LAMP reaction. The traditional Kretcheman SPR chip uses matching oils for the coupling of an Au glass slide and a BK-7 prism. Our PC prism has the advantage of direct Au film deposition without the use of a glass slide. It thus provides easier and better integration with the PMMA cartridge and further reduces the cost of materials for disposable applications. We pre-filled the micro-reactors with 10 \u03bcl of premixed LAMP solution to fully immerse the gold film. This volume does not cause the reagent to overflow when we seal the micro-reactors with adhesive film. Whether the reaction chamber is tightly sealed or not can be verified by the SPR response curve. We have noticed that if the seal is damaged, the LAMP reaction will be stopped, possibly due to the evaporation of water changing the mixed volume ratio of the solution.",

As shown in Section 3.1, the static refractive index of the LAMP medium decreased by approximately 0.0011 refractive index (RI) units. This change in refractive index might be due to amplified DNA, reaction by-products, or bulk medium. The change in refractive index provides a feasible mechanism for measurement of LAMP by the SPR sensor, which is known to have high sensitivity for refractive index changes. Fig. 5A shows the overlaid results of real-time SPR response versus different initial concentrations of DNA templates. The results are fitted to values measured with a refractometer. The detection range for initial DNA concentrations was 2 fg/ml to 20 ng/ml. Fig. 5 shows that as initial DNA template concentration increases, more prominent changes in SPR responses were recorded. The average response for 20 ng/ml is approximately 533 \u0394RU, from which a refractive-index change of 1.1193 \u00d7 10\u22123 was obtained.
