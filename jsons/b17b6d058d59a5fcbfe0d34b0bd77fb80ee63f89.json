Healthcare administrators and emergency management must attempt to calculate needs based on projected illnesses and existing capacities. Based on a 40% prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States during the pandemic, 100 million people infected, about 21 million will be hospitalized, with about 4.5 million of them needing intensive care. While healthcare systems across the country have varying abilities to accommodate this patient load, a six-month epidemic will result in filling 275% of the potentially available capacity of inpatient beds and >500% of the intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity. If the course is flattened to 12 months, the need for hospital beds would be 137% and the ICU beds 254% of capacity. 1 Either situation will require a significant increase in our physician, nurse, and associated workforce.",

Many factors go into this process, including selecting the groups of professionals we will need, streamlining their licensing and credentialing processes, identifying appropriate roles for them, and supporting their health and well-being. The questions we must answer are these: How many staff will we need? How do we provide them with emergency licenses and credentials to practice? What interstate licensing compacts and registration systems exist to facilitate the process? What caveats are there to using retired healthcare professionals and healthcare students? How can we best avoid attrition among and increase the numbers of international medical graduates? Which non-clinical volunteers can we use and in what capacities? The answers to these questions will change as the crisis develops, although the earlier we address them, the smoother will be the process of using augmentees for the healthcare system.

As of late March, New York was increasing existing hospitals' bed capacity by at least 50%, doubling the number of ICU beds, and waiting for the US Army to convert four sites into temporary hospitals for people needing less intensive care or who are recovering. 2 Washington State has received 1000 hospital beds from the military, and California, anticipating a need for more than 19,000 new beds, is opening multiple temporary hospitals, including reopening some that had closed. Florida is similarly opening multiple hospitals with thousands of beds. 2 In disaster situations, although most healthcare professionals will want to respond, whether they actually do so, and then continue to do so, depends on the risk they perceive to themselves and their families, the measures being taken to keep them safe, the value they see in their work, the completeness and transparency of the information they are given about the developing situation, and their personal (professional, religious, and other) values. 3, 4 Once healthcare professionals decide to stay, their numbers will inevitably decrease due to the vast influx of patients and the expanded roles they must perform, leading to burnout, as well as to illness-related attrition, especially in epidemics. For example, 14% of Spain's first 40,000 confirmed coronavirus cases were medical professionals.",

The goal . . . is to match the caregiver competencies with patient needs. To that end . . . the scope of practice and experience of various caregivers, should be used to assign caregivers to the patients.\" 6 Primary clinicians who may have normally worked in a variety of specialties can be assigned to positions in which they will be useful. All physicians, advanced nurse practitioners, and physician assistants can help in their areas of expertise or in fast-track and primary care, permitting the full-time staff to treat the sickest patients. Surgeons of all types, podiatrists, and some dentists (eg, oral surgeons) can assist in the emergency department (ED), clinics, and the operating room. Volunteer healthcare professionals can also staff alternative care sites. These extensions of clinicians' scopes of practice are informal; they are based on supervisors' knowledge of an individual's capabilities and on extenuating circumstances.

A management team is sent to help the requesting state's emergency operations center evaluate and obtain the appropriate resources. When EMAC has been activated, the receiving state recognizes responders' licenses, certificates, and permits, \"subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe.\" 15 EMAC was ratified by the US Congress in 1996 16 and has been adopted by all states, the District of Columbia, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The requesting state is responsible for reimbursing the assisting state for any expenses incurred. EMAC also addresses liability and compensation (sometimes through the Federal Emergency Management Agency).

In 2018, the Enhanced Nursing Licensure Compact (eNLC) was implemented, requiring applicants to undergo state and federal, fingerprint-based, criminal background checks. Nurses working under the NLC must practice in accordance with the laws of the state where the patient is located and are subject to that state's jurisdiction, licensing board, courts, and laws. 15 Unfortunately, four of the states hardest hit thus far 20 by COVID-19 (Washington, New York, Illinois, and California) are not signatories to this compact. 21 REPLICA allows EMS personnel to work across state boundaries in the performance of their assigned EMS duties. It functions in both routine and disaster settings and has been approved by 27 states. 22 REPLICA grants legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in any other member state. Under the agreement, EMS personnel must complete an FBI biometric criminal background check when applying for a new EMS license and states must share licensing and disciplinary actions with the other participating states. 23 A legal framework for the International Emergency Management Assistance Compact (IEMAC) already exists in Connecticut statutes. It describes a mutual aid system among six New England states and five Canadian provinces. However, no other jurisdiction has approved or implemented it. Its structure would provide licensure reciprocity for health professionals and other disaster workers aiding a governmentinitiated emergency response. 15 ",

It also waived licensing requirements for both instate and out-of-state healthcare providers to treat patients via telemedicine. 9 As it begins to augment overwhelmed civilian medical systems, the US Army has solicited its retired doctors, nurses, and medics who have served in critical care or EMS positions to return to work if they are not already employed in the civilian sector. 31 New York State officials have said that they will recertify individuals for immediate deployment. 2 Those returning to work in the NHS after >3 years' retirement, however, will take a short refresher course. This highlights one problem with this group of (usually) older individuals. Their knowledge of current practice may be outdated. In some cases, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic, they also may be at much higher risk of dying, although once an immunoglobulin G test is readily available, those found to have had the disease may be immune. 32 Many of them also may have other health-related problems. 30 This requires individual screening by a knowledgeable professional. In addition, they will need malpractice insurance, which they undoubtedly lack. On the other hand, they will bring a lifetime of knowledge and experience, and often amazing skill in those procedures with which they are familiar.",

Yet, depending on their level of training, they may have insufficient experience to be useful in many critical areas. More importantly, it raises the ethical issue of whether society should potentially sacrifice many next-generation practitioners to function in a potentially minor role. While in the UK more than 24,000 final-year student nurses and doctors are starting to work in the NHS, 29 US healthcare students have mostly been pulled off clinical rotations. 33 New York University Medical School offered its senior medical students who meet all graduation and screening requirements the voluntary opportunity to graduate three months early so they can help relieve the strain on frontline clinicians. The plan is to have them immediately begin working as paid interns in their hospital's internal medicine and emergency departments, although they do not have to continue in those specialties. 34 Medical schools across the country Augmenting the Disaster Healthcare Workforce Iserson have followed their lead. Many health professions students are assisting their colleagues in non-clinical ways, including staffing community and clinic information lines, helping to procure additional personal protective equipment, babysitting, grocery shopping, and doing other necessary chores for hospital workers, and volunteering on time-sensitive COVID-19 laboratory projects. 30, 35 International Medical Graduates So far, this group of generally well-trained additional physicians has received little attention. IMGs include those in training whose visas will soon expire, those accepted into US residency programs for July 1 but who cannot gain entry to the US; and those still unlicensed due to the requirement that they need to repeat a residency in the US. Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, advocates revisiting the rules about internationally trained physicians who are living in the US. He believes that we should eliminate \"for now-the regulation that you have to repeat your residency in order to practice in the US. These people are ready to go, and my experience with them is they're very talented, very well trained and coming from all different countries. That's a pool we should tap.\" 30 To address the dilemma of IMG physicians who may soon be compelled to leave the workforce against their will or who were supposed to begin residencies, the American Medical Association \"urged immigration authorities to extend visas for foreign national physicians lawfully practicing in the US and for the Departments of State and Homeland Security to expedite visa processing to ensure that non-US citizen IMGs can enter the country to begin their residency training programs on July 1.\" 36 As of early April, the government has not taken any action to retain or acquire these physicians.",

Supervisors must carefully manage augmentees who may not be familiar with the facility, its procedures, and personnel, even if they are healthcare professionals. That includes carefully planning the group's work schedules, housing, meals, and security. Burnout is common among disaster workers. Often this is due to workers' unwillingness to step aside to let others assume their tasks at the end of a shift. Augmentees housed in the patient treatment facility may be unable to rest adequately, especially when sleeping and resting areas are not sufficiently isolated from patient care areas. Food keeps the army of disaster healthcare workers on its feet and helps maintain esprit de corps. With limited outside sources of prepared food coupled with long work hours, facilities should expect to feed staff 24 hours a day. 37 The most important principle is to make safety the first consideration-in all situations. A necessary part of the overall security system is to supply some type of identificationpreferably in a format that cannot be easily copied-to those volunteers who have authorization to enter the healthcare facility. For example, some nurses in New York City hospitals are benefiting from newly instated protections, including \"nurses now being driven to and from work in private cars whose drivers are certified healthy, sealed lunches being delivered to their hospitals, childcare, and grocery deliveries to their families at home.\" 7 New York nurse Katherine Ramos, currently working at an ED and caring for two ill family members, said grocery delivery \"made a major difference in her ability to continue to care for others and help flatten the curve. 'They have not just been keeping me safe, but they've been keeping the rest of the populations safe, which is huge,' Ramos said. 'I don't want to be the one spreading anything to anybody.'\" 7 Personal welfare is often disregarded in times of crisis. Experienced disaster team members suggest that encouraging augmentees to care for themselves will allow them to function ",
