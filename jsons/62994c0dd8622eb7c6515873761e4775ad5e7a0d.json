ORF1 encodes a 1693 amino acids (AAs) long polyprotein that has structural and functional motifs responsible for viral replication: methyltransferase, papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Ahmad et al., 2011) domain) and a polyproline or hypervariable region (Holla et al., 2013) . ORF2 encodes a 660 AAs protein which is the main component of the viral capsid (Zafrullah et al., 1999) . The capsid is formed by the interaction of ORF2 protein dimers with the 5 end of the viral genome through its N-terminal region, which is rich in arginine (AA 101; 180 molecules of proORF2 per virus particle) (Xing et al., 2010) . This protein has three linear domains: the S domain, which forms the capsid, and the M and P domains, which are involved in the interaction of the virus with the host cell (Perez-Gracia et al., 2014) .

The ORF3 protein probably regulates the host cell environment through its interaction with various intracellular pathways. Firstly, it activates the ERK by binding and inhibiting their phosphatase. Prolonged activation of ERK would generate a survival and proliferative cellular sign that can favor viral replication and extend the life of infected cells by attenuating the intrinsic pathway of death. Secondly, the innate immune response is downregulated by reducing acute phase protein expression and increasing secretion of \u24231-microglobulin with immunosuppressive capacity (Chandra et al., 2008) . The ORF3 protein interacts with ORF2.

Since Koonin and colleagues (Koonin et al., 1992) first described its genomic structure in 1992, there have been no significant advances in our understanding of the genome structure; the sequence published by this group is still used as a reference by many researchers. Thus, our method should contribute to the knowledge of the HEV genome, as it enables direct and sensitive amplification of the complete coding genome from clinical samples, unlike most published methods, which have been standardized for use after HEV has been grown in cell culture e.g. (Tanaka et al., 2007) . Our system would allow clinical samples (of serum or feces) to be used to analyze the complete sequence in human HEV infections of particular interest to public health; for instance comparative genome analysis of chronic and acute infections could be done. Furthermore, it is important to have highly sensitive research tools to investigate HEV transmission by blood products, since this is known to be possible with low viral loads (Huzly et al., 2014) . To date, the only complete HEV genome sequences available in databases from Spanish research groups correspond to viruses found in pigs (EU723513, EU723516 and EU723515) (Peralta et al., 2009) .

Viral methyltransferase is essential for HEV replication and infectivity, and is required for efficient binding of mRNA to ribosomes as well as for avoiding the innate immune response mediated by interferon (Pichlmair et al., 2006) . Heterogeneity of the second AA of the PCP putative catalytic site (Tyr/Cys), imprecision in the function and limits for the region that has been proposed but not confirmed as being a functional protease (Suppiah et al., 2011) , together with its low level of conservation, highlights the need for functional studies in relation to this protein. Conversely, conservation of RdRp I-VIII motifs including the GDD sequence that binds Mg 2+ , which is essential for replication, is consistent with its proposed key functional role (Koonin, 1991) . Two described domains are still not functionally characterized at present. Of these, the Y domain is highly conserved in our analysis, suggesting that an important function is located in this region, although little is known about it. In the case of the X or macro domain, although its function is unclear, it is analogous to other viral genomes that are better known as coronaviruses (Koonin et al., 1992) . It may not be essential for replication, given its high tolerance to polymorphic AAs. The macro domain is known to be involved in the inflammation process in animal models, and influences viral pathogenicity by substitution of a conserved AA residue that is responsible for the reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

The previously described PMSP motif of the P1 proline-rich region (Ahmad et al., 2011) occurs in the PMS(F/Y) reference sequences, but not in any case of P80, suggesting that a mistake has been made in classifying residues into this motif. Amino acid S79, whose phosphorylation is determinant for the ORF3-ORF2 interaction (Tyagi et al., 2002) , is fully conserved in all of them. The analysis of the IC sequence indicates that the sequence from feces was fully representative of that from serum, making molecular analysis more feasible when serum samples are scarce. Methyltransferase and the Y domain showed no mutations with respect to the consensus. In contrast, PCP, the X domain, helicase and RdRp had 1, 3, 3 and 9 AA substitutions, respectively. Mutations accumulate predominantly in the intermediate portion of the RdRp, presumably being located outside the protein's active site, although the previously described III and IV motifs (Koonin, 1991) are affected. Conversely, the 3 region and the GDD functional motif described as keys for replication (Agrawal et al., 2001 ) is fully conserved. The data provided by (Lhomme et al., 2014a) suggest that the proline-rich region has an important role in the persistence of the infection. The studied IC sequence harbors neither inser-tion nor deletions in this genome region, which may be to do with the resolution of the infection. Future research on immunocompromised patients becoming persistently infected would provide data on the molecular basis of HEV persistence. ORF2 and ORF3 domains present no or single AA substitutions, with the exception of the Nterminal portion of S domain, which accumulates six mutations. We hypothesize that these differences in the capsid protein might be related to morphological or functional features, but they must surely represent phylogenetic differences relative to the reference sequences in terms of sub-genotype. Finally, we found a mutation in the IC sequence of the PXXP motifs of the P2 region associated with virus release (Pawson, 1995) . Future directed mutation analysis might investigate the effect of this specific substitution on virus release.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 68, "end": 98, "text": "(Rodriguez-Frias et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 191, "end": 218, "text": "(Perez-Gracia et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 266, "end": 286, "text": "(Holla et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 287, "end": 316, "text": "Rodriguez-Frias et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 395, "end": 415, "text": "(Holla et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 435, "end": 455, "text": "(Holla et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 487, "end": 509, "text": "(Karpe and Meng, 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 519, "end": 541, "text": "(Suppiah et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 583, "end": 605, "text": "(Karpe and Meng, 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 623, "end": 643, "text": "(Holla et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 656, "end": 676, "text": "(Ahmad et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 927, "end": 949, "text": "(Kar-Roy et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1095, "text": "(Taneja et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1249, "text": "(Ahmad et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1506, "text": "(Tyagi et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2119, "text": "(Koonin, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2243, "text": "(Agrawal et al., 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2309, "text": "(Lhomme et al., 2014a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3205, "text": "(Pawson, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We conclude that the designed tool allows the molecular analysis of the complete HEV coding genome sequences from clinical samples.
