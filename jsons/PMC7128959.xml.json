            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the country within 1 month. The pathogen of this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name on February 11, 2020 for the epidemic disease: Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has affected people in more than 28 countries/regions, including Taiwan, and has become a global threat.1, 2, 3, 4 In addition, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the virus, which was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice.5 Prior to this, on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern; therefore, this outbreak constitutes a public health risk through the international spread of disease and requires a coordinated international response. Increased dissemination of information through use of the internet is associated with increased transmission of information from all geographical regions and across disciplines regarding recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-196; nevertheless, important factors associated with COVID-19, specifically age and sex distribution, incubation period, clinical features, and optimal treatment, remain uncertain. Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease (ARD), and pneumonia.",

Detailed epidemiological information based on a larger sample of patients infected with COVID-19 is needed to determine the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to determine whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period.",

In fact, an in vitro study demonstrated that the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of remdesivir against nCoV-2019/BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 in Vero E6 cells was 0.77 \u03bcM, and the 90% effective concentration (EC90) was 1.76 \u03bcM.31 However, only one case in the US showed a clinical response to remdesivir, although the viral load appeared to decline at the time of initiating remdesivir (cycle threshold from 18\u201320 to 23\u201324).33 Subsequently, two large clinical trials, NCT04252664 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252664) for mild/moderate COVID-19 and NCT04257656 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656) for severe COVID-18, were initiated in China, with an estimated end date in early April 2020. In these two trials, the 10-day regimen of remdesivir was 100 mg once daily for 9 days after the loading of 200 mg on day 1.34 Chloroquine is another promising drug.35\n,\n36 An in vitro study on the time-of-addition assay in Vero E6 cells demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and at post-entry stages of COVID-19, and the EC90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV was 6.90 \u03bcM.31 In addition, passive immunization therapy and the use of interferon could theoretically be helpful, but to date there is no evidence to validate this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Although information on COVID-19 has increased rapidly since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, many issues remain unresolved. First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier state to severe pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality rate was high.12, 13, 14 Subsequent to the publication of the studies of patients with only ARD or mild pneumonia, we found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased, children or neonates could contract COVID-19, and the mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports.8\n,\n11 However, whether children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear.49 In addition, most studies, especially those with a large patient population, were conducted in China, and the study of asymptomatic carriers was limited. More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Second, Zou et al. reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients; however, the viral loads from patients with severe diseases were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate presentations. Moreover, higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat.50 As there is a concern of virus spread due to severe cough induced by performing a throat swab, nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of patients with COVID-19. However, this study involved a population of only 18 patients, including one asymptomatic patient.49 In addition, every test has its own limitation and sensitivity/specificity; however, the studies investigating the performance of current diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2 among different COVID-19 populations, including asymptomatic carriers, ARD, and pneumonia, are lacking. The false positive and negative rates of each diagnostic tool among patients with COVID-19 presenting varying degrees of severity of the disease remain unknown. This type of information is important for screening patients with COVID-19 and to aid isolation and infection control strategies. Finally, since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the asymptomatic individual, the prophylactic or pre-emptive use of effective anti-viral agents to reduce the viral load and decrease the risk of virus spread from asymptomatic carriers may help to control the spread of COVID-19.",
