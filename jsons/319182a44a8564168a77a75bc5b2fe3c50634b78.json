Renin, a protease produced predominantly in the 304 kidneys, cleaves angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin I (Ang I). Subsequently, 305 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves Ang I to produce Ang II. Ang II is 306 hydrolyzed by various angiotensinases, such as ACE2. ACE2 is a terminal 307 carboxypeptidase and a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and a potent negative 308 regulator of the RAS. The imbalance in enzymatic activity of ACE/ACE2 has been 309 suggested to involve in pathogenesis in several diseases, including lung diseases (23). 310",

GSE19187 included gene expression data from a 167 nasal epithelial cell brushing study of 38 children (11 healthy children, 14 children 168 isolated rhinitis, 7 children with rhinitis and controlled asthma, 6 children with rhinitis and 169 uncontrolled asthma) on a platform of Affymetrix Human gene 1.0 ST Array (13). 170 The purpose of this study was to establish gene expression signatures of nasal 171 brushings from children with dust mite allergic rhinitis as defined by clinical diagnoses 172 and asthma control staging as determined by the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on 173 Asthma (ARIA) (14) clinical criteria and positive skin prick testing to Dermatophagoides 174 pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farina. Controlled or uncontrolled asthma 175 diagnosed was based upon NAEPP EPR3 criteria (15). Supervised learning and 176 unsupervised clustering were used to predict the different subgroups of patients and 177 define signaling pathways associated with rhinitis and asthma. These profiles were 178 compared with those of primary cultures of human nasal epithelial cells stimulated with 179 either IL-4, IL-13, interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta or IFN-gamma following in vitro 180 differentiation. For our analysis, we used baseline data prior to any IL-4, IL-13 or IFN 181 exposure. 182 The second dataset GSE4302 contained gene expression data that stemmed 183 from an airway epithelial brushing study of 86 subjects (28 healthy subjects, 16 smokers 184 and 42 mild-to-moderate asthma) where diagnosis of asthma was based upon NAEPP 185 EPR3 criteria (15). Data are on a platform of Affymetrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 186 Waltham, MA, USA) Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (16-19). In this study, 187 participants underwent bronchoscopy with endobronchial brushing and biopsy. However, only epithelial gene expression data were included in the dataset. Epithelial 189 cell gene expression was determined using microarray and PCR analysis. In a subset, 190 epithelial cells were exposed to IL-13 and dexamethasone to further elucidate IL-13-191 induced genes and which were suppressed by dexamethasone. Participants with a 192 history of oral or inhaled steroid use in the past 4 weeks were excluded. For our 193 analysis we evaluated baseline data prior to any exposure to IL-13 and/or 194 dexamethasone. 195 196 Statistical analysis 197 Analysis of the ex vivo data was performed using a mixed effects model with the 198 subject as a random effect. We performed statistical analyses on \u2206Ct values ( -(Ct PPIA -199 Ct ACE2 )). Analysis on this scale (log of concentration) exhibits distributional 200 characteristics that are more consistent with modeling assumptions (Normal errors, 201 constant within group variance) than analyses for 2 -\u2206\u2206Ct that are commonly used (12). 202",

These results support an important protective role of 316 Ang1-7 in allergic asthma, as well as the role of ACE2 in reducing inflammation (24). T2 317 cytokines appear to reduce ACE2 expression, reducing the anti-inflammatory function of 318 ACE-2-generated Ang1-7. 319 ACE2 also has an additional function in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The 320 spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to mediate virus attachment to host cell 321 membranes. Hoffmann et al. (9) demonstrated that host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 322 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven 323 inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 324 for S protein priming. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 could be a therapeutic target in COVID-19. 325 It has been shown that ACE2 is a host factor employed in cell entry by two additional 326 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (25). TMPRSS2 has been 327 reported to facilitate infection with human coronavirus 229E (26), Middle East 328 respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (27), H1N1 (28, 29), H3N2 and 329 H7N9 influenza viruses (30, 31). Taken together, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are 330 important host factors for infection with many viruses, with some particularly relevant to 331 asthma. We speculate whether the upregulation of TMPRSS2 gene expression in the 332 upper and lower airway increases susceptibility of asthmatic patients to infection by 333 influenza. 334 The role of T2 cytokines in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is not clear. IL-4 and IL-13, both T2 cytokines relevant to asthma, reduce ACE2 expression in Vero 336 E6 cells, a primate kidney epithelial cell line (32). We show similar effects by IL-13 in the 337 upper and lower airway in human asthma and rhinitis. While we evaluated gene 338 expression, there are conflicting reports regarding the existence of ACE2 protein in the 339 nasal epithelium. Hamming et al. reported that ACE2 protein was present in the basal 340 layer of the nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium but not present on surface of nasal 341 epithelial cells (33). Bertram and colleagues noted ACE2 and TMPRSS2 342 immunostaining in sinus epithelium using antigen retrieval methods (34). Furthermore, 343there are two forms of ACE2, full-length ACE2 and soluble ACE2, the latter which is 344shed from the full-length, membrane bound protein and is considered as a potential 345 therapy (35). In our study we report overall gene expression of ACE2 in nasal and 346 airway epithelial cells to include the extracellular domain, but do not report expression of 347 membrane bound and soluble forms. While we speculate that T2 cytokine stimulation 348 may suppress ACE2 in the central and upper airway to reduce viral entry, evaluation of 349 membrane bound and soluble forms of ACE2 is the logical next step to determine the 350 significance of this observation. 351In addition, increased expression of TMPRSS2 could negate any protective effect 352 of reduced ACE2 expression. Epidemiological support for such assertion is suggestive 353 as studies from China have not identified asthma as a major risk factor for severe 354 COVID-19 (2, 3), some reports from the United States have identified asthma as a risk 355 factor for COVID-19 (5, 6) while others have not (36, 37). Additional data from both 356 biological and epidemiological studies are warranted.",
