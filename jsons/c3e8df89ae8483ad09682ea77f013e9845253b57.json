However, few studies have evaluated the duration of viral shedding which has important implications for guiding decisions around isolation precautions and antiviral treatment in patients with confirmed COVID-19 [7, 8] . Factors associated with prolonged duration of viral shedding are totally unclear. One recent randomized controlled trial showed that Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment could not provide incremental benefits, including viral shedding, beyond standard care in hospitalized severely ill patients with COVID-19 [9] . But a post hoc subgroup analysis found that earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could accelerate clinical recovery and reduce mortality [9] . Therefore, it remains crucial to determine whether adding LPV/r treatment impacts the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in non-critically ill patients and whether earlier administration of LPV/r could shorten the duration of viral shedding.",

Our corresponding estimate in the current study using throat-swab specimen for viral detection was 23 days. About 30% patients had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA after 30 days from symptom onset. Investigations of virus shedding in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have demonstrated that viral RNA was detected in the respiratory tract specimen for more than 1 month from illness onset [11, 12] . Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens elicited a higher and more prolonged RNA levels than that in upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens [13] . More severely ill patients typically had higher and more prolonged RNA levels [13] .

Interestingly, subgroup analysis found that only initial administration of LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not started after 10 days, could shorten the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding compared with no LPV/r treatment. One recent randomized controlled trial showed that LPV/r treatment could not provide additional benefit, including viral shedding, beyond standard care in hospitalized adult patients with severely ill COVID-19 who required a range of ventilatory support mode [8] . However, a post hoc subgroup of the LPV/v in the randomized controlled trial found that earlier administration of antiviral treatment could accelerate clinical recovery and reduce mortality, which is consistent with our findings. Admittedly, patients recruited in the trial were in advanced phase of infection (as evidenced by 25% mortality in the control group). In contrast, most All rights reserved.

Because LPV/r is not particularly designed against SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible for LPV/r on SARS-CoV-2 to be as effective as neuraminidase inhibitor on influenza [20] . The median duration of viral shedding even in patients who received LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset was 19 days in current study, demonstrating that LPV/r treatment could not completely inhibit viral replication. In this regard, earlier administration of LPV/r therapy after symptom onset to patients who were not in late phase of infection may be the key things to determine its efficacy. In summary, older age and lack of LPV/r treatment contributed to prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment can shorten the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

            "text": "Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials remain crucial to test whether earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding, accelerate clinical recovery and improve survival in patients with COVID-19, especially for non-critically ill patients. One randomized controlled trial for LPV/r in treatment of mild COVID-19 has launched in Korea (NCT04307693). Our investigation has some limitations. First, owing to triage strategies, almost all patients in our hospital were categorized as general and severe COVID-19, therefore extrapolating these findings to critically ill patients need caution. Second, the estimate duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is limited by the type of respiratory specimen, frequency of respiratory specimen collection andlack of quantitative viral RNA detection. Third, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not necessarily indicate the production of infectious virus. Forth, we excluded fatal cases from the final analysis because all of them had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA until death, and time to death could not accurately reflect the duration of viral shedding, therefore the association between viral shedding and mortality could be not assessed. Finally, interpretation of our findings was limited by sample size. Further large cohort studies are still needed to define the duration of viral shedding and risk factors for prolonged viral shedding in patients with COVID-19.",
