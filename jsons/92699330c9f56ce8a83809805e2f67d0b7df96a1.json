Coronavirus nucleoprotein (N) plays a structural role in virus assembly and has also been shown to be important in RNA synthesis. 4 In addition, template switching, an obligatory step in CoV transcription, needs to overcome an energy threshold. Therefore, we asked whether RNA chaperones are involved in transcription and, most importantly, if N is an RNA chaperone.",

We used transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as a model to investigate this possibility. No RNA chaperone activity can be predicted based on domain conservation. Nevertheless, it was recently reported that RNA chaperones are the protein class with the highest frequency of containing long intrinsically disordered regions. 14 Structural analyses of coronavirus N proteins showed that they also fulfill this criterion.",

Recombinant N protein was incubated with biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides representing viral TRSs or a cellular RNA. A band shift appeared in all cases, indicating that N protein binds RNA nonspecifically, as expected (data not shown). To map the RNA binding domain in the N protein, a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), generated in our laboratory, was used. 17 In similar EMSA experiments, it was found that some of the mAbs recognizing the amino terminus of the protein significantly blocked N-RNA binding, while mAbs recognizing the carboxy terminus did not, and a supershift band appeared in these cases (data not shown). A mAb from each set was used in subsequent experiments. Once the functionality of the recombinant N protein was assessed, an advanced RNA chaperone assay was performed. Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) dimer RNA was used in a hammerhead ribozyme self-cleavage assay. 16 This RNA has two ribozyme cleavage sites and must be properly folded for the cleavage reaction to take place. In the absence of protein, under cleavage conditions, all processed products appeared but there was no progression in the cleavage reaction with incubation time. In contrast, in the presence of recombinant N protein, cleavage products appeared, with a significant decrease in the amount of uncleaved products (Fig. 2) . This result strongly suggested that TGEV N protein is an RNA chaperone.",

In the absence of protein, there were no changes in the cleavage reaction with incubation time. The same result was obtained in the presence of the control GST protein. In the presence of recombinant N protein, the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved product increased more than threefold compared with reactions lacking the N protein. This enhancement of the cleavage reaction was due to the N protein, because preincubation of the GST-N with a mAb that blocked RNA-protein binding also blocked activity in the cleavage reaction. The levels of cleavage product obtained were similar to those observed in the absence of N protein. Similarly, N protein preincubated with a mAb that did not block N-RNA binding enhanced the cleavage reaction, and the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved product was more than fivefold compared with the protein-free reactions. The difference between results obtained with GST-N protein alone or with the mAb present protein was not simply due to its RNA binding ability, as another RNA binding protein, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), did not exert any effect on the cleavage reaction (data not shown).
