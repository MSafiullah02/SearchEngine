As of March 15, 2020, more than 160 0 0 0 cases and more than 60 0 0 deaths in over 150 countries have been reported ( https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ). Few cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents have also been described [3] [4] [5] , with a null death rate in the group 0-10 years, and 0.2% in the group 10-19 years. The majority of the most severe clinical courses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and those with chronic comorbidities, often receiving immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory treatment [1 , 2] .",

The novel coronavirus seems to dysregulate immune response in infected individuals, mainly by acting on lymphocytes, especially T-cells [8] . Whether patients with IBD may be more susceptible to COVID-19 is a reasonable concern. Currently no cases of IBD patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. International IBD non-profit organisations issued online advices and preliminary recommendations regarding COVID-19 management in adults with IBD [9 , 10] . We would like to emphasize the importance of addressing main concerns from IBD paediatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic, taking into consideration their peculiar disease characteristics and comorbidity spectrum.",

Currently no evidence supports treatment suspension in mild or moderate cases of COVID-19, neither in children living in an endemic area, also due to the washout period of most immunomodulators (such as azathioprine, methotrexate) and biologics. An exception could be raised by steroid treatment. In paediatric IBD, different studies have shown steroids carrying higher risk of infections compared with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, while the risk of immunomodulators and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents, given alone, seems to be comparable [6 , 7] . In addition, steroids are not effective for the treatment of lung injury or shock in adults' SARS-CoV-2 infection [11] . In line with these observations, discontinuation (or at least tapering) of steroid treatment during COVID-19 epidemic may be a reasonable option.",

The immunosuppressive effect of these drugs should not be overlooked, since it may eventually increase the risk of infectious complications and promote the spreading of COVID-19; however, active IBD itself has been thought to be a potential risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, it seems wise to apply an individual risk assessment, avoiding the postponement of new treatment (or increasing in dose an ongoing treatment) in case of severe disease flares. For patients on biologics, switching to subcutaneous self-injection medication (i.e. adalimumab) at home could be encouraged, aiming to limit hospital appointments, or if intravenous medication (i.e. infliximab) is not available.",

Indeed, although the most common clinical presentation of COVID-19 is a moderate-to-severe respiratory illness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea (3.8%), nausea, and vomiting (5%) can also occur [2] . In the retrospective analysis of hospitalized children carried out from January 7 to January 15, 2020 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 was detected in 6 previously healthy children, 4 presenting with vomiting [5] . A 22-year old male presented with diarrhoea at the onset of COVID-19 [13] . However, current clinical evidence does not support COVID-19 as a cause of IBD flares, and therefore a systematic exclusion of COVID-19 in the setting of an IBD flare is not recommended. In cases with suspected symptoms of COVID-19, prompt medical evaluation and careful followup are crucial. Only where exposure to confirmed COVID-19 occurs (viral RNA detection from nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, according to the World Health Organization), discontinuation of all immunosuppressive and biological treatment could be taken into consideration, as recommended during any severe infection [6 , 7] .",
