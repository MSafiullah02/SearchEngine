This information would be beneficial to adequately reorganize outpatient clinics and hospitals to provide the highest possible level of orthopaedic care to our patients in a safe and efficient manner. Methods A literature search was performed for relevant research articles. In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the EU CDC and other government health agency websites were searched for any relevant information. In particular, interest was paid to strategies and advise on managing the orthopaedic patient flow during outpatient clinics as well as surgical procedures including the necessary safety measures, while still providing a high-quality patient experience. The obtained information is provided as a narrative review. Results There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic. Conclusion As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned. The exact timing largely depends on factors outside of our control. After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase. This paper offers key points and possible strategies to provide the highest level of safety to both the orthopaedic patient and the orthopaedic team including administrative staff and nurses, during the start-up phase.

Nevertheless, the infection curve with a steep rise has placed extreme demands on the various health care systems and has led unfortunately to the break down of health care system in certain areas, forcing agonizing choices between live-saving treatment or not for certain patients.",

These main strategies have been able to effectively 'flatten the curve' of COVID-19 infections and hence delay the time of peak infection. However, these strategies do not reduce the absolute number of infections, they merely spread that absolutely number over time and thus provide more valuable time to treat the total number of patients effectively. There is a general consensus that this first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, most likely will be followed by a second and/ or third wave of infections in the absence of a vaccine. Thus, on one hand, as the first wave of this pandemic becomes controllable, continued vigilance is imperative and strategies need to be implemented to provide optimal prevention of a resurgence of infection and to react adequately in case of such a resurgence. On the other hand, a progressive return to normal orthopaedic activities is desirable as many patients with semi-urgent or chronic disabilities need help as they have been delayed for a significant period.",

LEVEL 0. Reopening of the orthopaedic outpatient clinic should ideally be associated with a screening for symptoms and testing of the entire orthopaedic team including physicians, nurses and administrative staff 1 day ahead of the opening. If tested negative, repeat testing at specific intervals might be advisable for screening and documentation purposes. If tested positive, the person should be quarantined and retested 14 days later. As reinfection and reactivation rates of the virus are still unclear, continued vigilance and repeat testing are still warranted. LEVEL 1. As a significant number of patients might be asymptomatic and infectious [4] , a routine questionnaire identifying potential infection or high risk for infection is currently being developed in collaboration with the CDC, Apple and Google. These self-questionnaires can be found at https ://www.apple .com/covid 19/ and include questions on the presence of emergency symptoms (severe, constant chest pain or pressure; extreme difficulty breathing; severe, constant lightheadedness; serious disorientation or unresponsiveness), age group (below 18, 18-64, above 65), recent symptoms (fever, chills or sweating; difficulty breathing; new or worsening cough; sore throat; aching throughout the body; vomiting or diarrhea), underlying disease or risk factors, international travel in the last 14 days, COVID-19 incidence in your area, direct exposure to others with COVID in the last 14 days, living in a long-term care facility, working in a medical facility in the last 14 days. This questionnaire is definitely of interest once the current restrictions are progressively lifted and could provide the orthopaedic team some guidance in getting specific categories of patients back into the office.",

            "text": "As the elderly and patients with co-morbidities are at a higher risk for nosocomial transmission [3] , it could be of interest to start up your clinic with the younger asymptomatic patients without documented risk factors. Ideally, the questionnaire section relating to specific COVID symptoms is performed digitally, 1 day ahead of the outpatient visit. Age, comorbidities and risk factors could be collected at the moment the patient is making the appointment. This information could route the patient to the most convenient time slot taking into account that older patients or patients with comorbidities are advised to wait until a later stage after restart. LEVEL 2. Upon entering the clinic, temperature controls using individual temperature checks by a certified nurse or by infrared cameras might further allow identification of patients with fever. Obvious observations like sweating, dyspnea or coughing need to draw the attention and alarm the staff for a potential infection. Patients need to be provided with a single-use face mask or surgical mask to reduce the risk of spreading virus particles. Usually no aerosol-producing procedures are performed during outpatient clinic, so the need of more advanced protective masks, such as FFP2 (N95) masks, should be not recommended for the medical doctors and sanitary personnel [5] . The reception staff needs to be protected adequately by avoiding unnecessary direct and indirect contact with patients. Ideally, exchanging any type of physical document or paperwork (ID card, written questionnaires) should be avoided. If impossible to avoid, adequate decontamination is necessary. LEVEL 3. Waiting areas will need specific attention including social distancing and hygiene. These countermeasures will significantly reduce the capacity of the waiting area and will profoundly affect the patient flow. The corona crisis will force the orthopedic team to redesign and rethink waiting areas. Fully packed waiting areas will no longer be the ideal and recommended scenario. Patients ideally wait outside, in the car, in the parking lot, in the cafeteria and are called in just in time. In between patients, the seats and other furniture need to be disinfected routinely. LEVEL 4. Once entering the examination room or doctor's office, access to and from the examination office space might be facilitated; conversion of a hand knob to an elbow knob might mitigate the contamination risk. The time spent in the room could be strictly minimalized in time and human resources. Therefore, certain aspects of the clinical visit like the subjective history taking might be done prior to the visit using a digital interface. The clinical orthopaedic exam should be done swiftly and efficiently. Orthopaedic residents and fellows are allowed to participate in the process.",

In the progressive start-up phase, 'urgent' and 'urgent, somewhat elective' surgery might be considered. Elective surgery should be further delayed until the highest level of safety can be guaranteed. According to AAOS guidelines, patients for whom surgery is deemed \"elective\" are those with chronic problems whose surgery can certainly be delayed without significant harm to the patient or eventual outcome. Although an argument can be made for the need for surgery in some individuals due to pain or functional impairment, the determining principle is that delaying treatment will not significantly alter the eventual outcome. Such surgeries include elective total joint replacements for osteoarthritis, spinal fusion, chronic joint conditions (e.g., atraumatic, chronic rotator cuff tears; posterior cruciate ligament injuries; and degenerative meniscal tears) and other conditions that although painful will not be altered by delay in treatment (e.g., elbow tendinitis and carpal tunnel surgery). Whereas the pathology may cause significant functional impairment to the patient, severely reducing his quality of life, major surgeries such as total joint replacement should still be performed. Patients undergoing total joint replacement will need to be able to be discharged from the hospital in the shortest delay possible (generally less than 72 h), thus to reduce the risk of nosocomial infections [2, 8] . Some outpatient surgery can be considered in early start-up phase, as the pathology can become more complex if left untreated or associated with a major functional deficit (defined as urgent, somewhat elective). Surgery for injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament tears, locked or bucket handle meniscus, acute traumatic rotator cuff tears, biceps injuries, should still be performed. If possible, these procedures should be done in the outpatient setting to minimize utilization of resources.",
