Although how viruses influence asthma inception is poorly understood, much research has focused on the host response to respiratory viruses and how viruses can promote; or how the host response is affected by subsequent allergen sensitization and exposure. This review focuses on the innate interferon-mediated host response to respiratory viruses and discusses and summarizes the available evidence that this response is impaired or suboptimal. In addition, the ability of respiratory viruses to act in a synergistic or additive manner with T H 2 pathways will be discussed. In this review we argue that these 2 outcomes are likely linked and discuss the available evidence that shows reciprocal negative regulation between innate interferons and T H 2 mediators. With the renewed interest in anti-T H 2 biologics, we propose a rationale for why they are particularly successful in controlling asthma exacerbations and suggest ways in which future clinical studies could be used to find direct evidence for this hypothesis.

This review will be limited to the discussion of impaired innate type I (IFN-a/IFN-b) and type III (IFN-ls) interferons in asthmatic patients. Some studies have shown a defective or impaired type II IFN-g response in cells of asthmatic patients or lower T H 1/T H 2 ratios in atopic asthmatic patients versus control subjects 7 ; however, these studies will not be discussed further.

Respiratory viruses are the main triggers of AEs in adults and school-aged children, accounting for around 85%.

Coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and the more recently identified metapneumoviruses and bocaviruses are also involved; however, they are less common. 12, 13 Both RSV and rhinoviruses have been associated with asthma inception and are strongly associated with wheeze in infants; however, the exact mechanisms remain elusive. There is some argument whether rhinoviruses and RSV cause asthma or might be markers of asthma susceptibility; it is also unclear whether both viruses act in the same manner or are subtly different. In young children RSV bronchiolitis has been linked to increased allergic sensitization 14 and immune skewing to increased T H 2 responses. 15 The skewing to T H 2 responses might reflect a way of evading protective T H 1 responses.

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are capable of infecting the bronchial epithelium of the lower airway, resulting in a local inflammatory reaction characterized by airway neutrophilia, attraction of T lymphocytes, activation of macrophages, and damage to the integrity of the bronchial epithelium. 7 In an effort to limit viral spread, host cells also mount a type I (IFN-a/b) and type III (IFN-l) interferon response. Interferons are antiviral cytokines made by a wide range of cells in response to viral infection and ligation of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Type I IFN-as and IFN-b signal through the IFN-a receptor (IFNAR) 1 and IFNAR2 complex, whereas type III IFN-ls (IFN-l1/IL-29, IFN-l2/IL-28A, and IFN-l3/IL-28B in human subjects) act through the IL-10 receptor b chain and IFN-l1 receptor a chain. 18 Interferons are the first-line defense against viral infection 19 and induce expression of the distinct genes termed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through signaling through the type I and type III interferon receptor complexes. 20, 21 ISGs can be extracellular proteins, such as the T H 1-attracting chemokines CXCL10 (interferoninducible protein 10) or CXCL11 (interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant [ITAC]), or other interferons, with IFN-b inducing downstream IFN-a and IFN-ls. 22 Most ISGs are intracellular proteins that interfere with and thus attempt to contain viral protein trafficking, nucleic acid synthesis, or virion assembly and release. Currently, the number of known ISGs is thought to exceed 380 23 ; however, there is the possibility of cell type-specific ISGs that are yet to be identified.",

HBECs from asthmatic patients produced lower levels of IFN-b, had lower levels of virus-induced apoptosis, and higher rhinovirus loads over time. Proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and CCL5) between the 2 groups were similar, and the cells from asthmatic patients produced normal levels of rhinovirus replication when pretreated with exogenous IFN-b.

Although the trial found no benefit in the primary outcome in the intent-to-treat population of 72 asthmatic patients receiving active treatment versus 75 receiving placebo, a beneficial effect was observed on peak expiratory flow (P 5.033), and in a subpopulation composed of patients with more severe asthma (n 5 27 active and n 5 31 placebo), benefit was observed in ACQ scores (P 5 .004) and peak expiratory flow (P 5 .029). This finding supports the premise that interferon production is indeed impaired in asthmatic patients and that restoring this defect then beneficially influences clinical disease.",

Newcastle disease virus and RSV have both been used to show differences in interferon levels between groups when studying PBMCs 4,32 ; however, a recent side-by-side comparison of interferon responses in asthmatic patients and control subjects with RSV and influenza virus did not show impaired interferon production in HBECs from asthmatic patients. 40 In another study differences in IFN-a responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells have also been shown with influenza virus. 28 More studies with comparisons of rhinovirus with other respiratory viruses clearly need to be performed to better understand whether the defect in interferon expression is virus specific. Likewise, studies of impaired interferon production in nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic patients have produced mixed results, 41, 45, 46 suggesting that deficiency might be more profound in lower airway cells, yet deficiency is still observable in peripheral leukocyte populations. 28, 32, 47 The role of atopy is perplexing; Baraldo et al 34 showed that deficient interferon production was a feature of atopic asthmatic, nonatopic asthmatic, and nonasthmatic atopic children, 34 and studies focusing on allergic rhinitis without asthma have produced mixed results, 4, 52 furthering the debate about whether it is asthma or atopy (or both) that drives this defect. Some argue that there is controversy regarding interferon deficiency in asthmatic patients because studies investigating interferon responses in patients with stable disease 53 or during AEs in vivo 54,55 find increased rather than decreased interferon levels in asthmatic patients. However, we would argue that studies of interferon levels in vivo will be confounded by differences in viral loads and that if one wishes to investigate the presence of interferon deficiency in a disease state, this can only be done by infecting cells with a standardized quantity of virus ex vivo or stimulating cells with a standard quantity of a viral mimic ex vivo. However, enhanced rhinovirus replication in asthmatic patients in vivo during experimental challenge studies has been observed. 2, 7 Gaps in our knowledge relating to the argument for impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients include (1) a lack of studies testing whether the defect is stable and repeatable in the same samples, (2) few data on asthma phenotypes other than atopic asthma, (3) a paucity of studies with viruses other than rhinovirus or a rhinovirus versus other comparison with other viruses, and (4) a lack of studies relating interferon deficiency to either asthma control at the time samples were taken or underlying asthma severity. Another limitation is that ex vivo studies use small patient numbers and a definite study of interferon expression in larger studies, such as birth cohort studies, is only beginning to be applied with impaired antiviral immunity taken into consideration.",

            "text": "Our mechanistic understanding of impaired interferon responses in asthmatic patients remains poor, despite much effort. The inability to identify detailed mechanisms likely points to a complex mechanism that is not easily understood. Initially, researchers considered 2 possible explanations. First was that impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients was due to a single gene defect, microRNA, or epigenetic determinant present in asthmatic patients. This hypothesis would describe the defect as static, unchanging, and likely identifiable in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or perhaps large gene expression data sets from next-generation sequencing approaches or protein activation data sets. The second hypothesis described a more complex gene-environment interaction that could involve a variable or even transient phenotype, immune imprinting, the actions of more than 1 gene, microRNA, or an epigenetic determinant. Thus far, databases of next-generation sequencing 56, 57 and microarray data 38, 58 have generally all failed to show a reproducible single gene defect that would explain the specific decreased expression of innate interferons observed in asthmatic patients. With the exception of TLR7 59 and the highaffinity receptor for the IgE a chain (Fc\u03b5RIa) at 1q23, 60 large published GWAS data sets on asthma again showed no obvious clue that explains these findings. 61 The possibility still exists that a single gene defect resides in a very specific subpopulation of asthmatic patients but has been diluted in the larger studies that define asthma based on the clinical attributes or FEV 1 alone and often involve several hundred donors. Considering the different cell types involved (leukocytes vs structural cells), it is possible that the mechanism responsible for the defect is cell type specific. It is also possible that HBECs, because of the culture associated with their study, are more prone to lose this defect, explaining the conflicting studies that have arisen. Considering the available evidence, coupled with the failure of several HBEC studies to reproduce this defect, 38, 39, 43 overall, the data argue against the single gene-hypothesis and encourages alternative hypotheses to be considered.",

SOCS1, but not the closely related family member SOCS3, was observed to be of greater abundance in bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with atopic asthma, and abundance was related to PC 20 data and atopy. In a small cohort of asthmatic children with severe therapy-resistant asthma, 36 levels of SOCS1 mRNA in unstimulated cells negatively correlated with impaired IFN-b and IFNl expression after rhinovirus infection and poly I:C treatment. 63 SOCS1 can also function as a nuclear protein through a conserved J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 140, NUMBER 4 nuclear localization sequence and might interfere with gene transcription. 67 In the same bronchial biopsy specimens, SOCS1 nuclear staining was increased in asthmatic patients, and functional studies in vitro with mutants lacking the ability to home to the nucleus did not suppress rhinovirus-induced IFN-b and IFN-l1 induction. 63 The data strongly suggest that SOCS1, a virus and T H 2 cytokine-inducible negative regulator that is overexpressed in asthmatic patients, might be at least in part responsible for the impaired interferon levels observed. Further studies are required to support these findings, including bigger studies of SOCS1 expression in bronchial epithelium of asthmatic patients. A recent study showed reduced SOCS1 mRNA expression in bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with severe asthma compared with patients with mild-to-moderate asthma; however, immunostaining was not performed. 68 The idea of increased SOCS1 expression in asthmatic patients remains attractive and provides a mechanistic link of how T H 2 pathways can negatively regulate innate interferons.",

TLR7 is a single-stranded RNA receptor that uses the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) to engage a signaling apparatus leading to IRF3/7 activation and hence IFNa transcription. Furthermore, TLR7 expression was inversely related to AE rate and ACQ scores, strongly suggesting that TLR7 expression levels are related to clinical asthma outcomes. Studying expression patterns of microRNAs identified several mi-croRNAs that differed between AMs from healthy subjects and asthmatic patients, and 4 of these showed identity to the untranslated region of TLR7. Further expression analysis identified that 3 of these microRNAs, 150, 152, and 375, were significantly upregulated in AMs from asthmatic patients versus control subjects. Each microRNA was not induced by the T H 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, and also IFN-g and were not affected by steroid treatment. The importance of each microRNA in reducing TLR7 expression was then shown by using TLR7-specific luciferase reporters, and targeting each microRNA resulted in significantly increased interferon levels and ISG induction. Together, the data offer an important mechanistic explanation for impaired interferon in AMs from asthmatic patients in that decreased abundance of TLR7, an important PRR, is due to increased expression of 3 microRNAs that target the mRNA of TLR7. Although the article did not discuss why these microRNAs have increased abundance in asthmatic patients, the 3 microRNAs represent new therapeutic targets aiming to restore defective AM antiviral immunity to rhinovirus.",

Together, these studies suggest that in leukocytes TLR7 expression or function might be a key factor determining impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients.

The discovery of important pro-T H 2 factors (IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) produced from the epithelium that induce type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) now allows a more precise understanding of how respiratory viruses can promote T H 2 pathways because the mediators are induced by viral infection and their expression is consistent with clinical manifestations of asthma, asthma severity, or features of AE pathogenesis. 2,3 How viruses induced pro-T H 2 factors from the epithelium and how this relates to establishing T H 2 immunity are depicted in Fig 1.

In the same experiments IFN-a increased Fc\u03b5RIg chain expression; the g chain is involved in stabilizing Fc\u03b5RIa on the cell surface and together suggests a more complex role for IFN-a in regulating atopy and IgE-mediated responses. 80 In fact, viral induction of IFN-a in early life is thought by some to enhance Fc\u03b5RIa expression on DCs and other antigen-presenting cells, likely leading to enhancement of allergic sensitization, and has been suggested as another potential mechanism how viruses contribute to the establishment of atopy. 16 Mouse models have also been able to replicate the negative regulation on T H 2 responses; IFN-l2 (IL-28), when administered through the airways, can suppress the generation of allergic airways inflammation in an ovalbumin sensitization and challenge model in mice that is T H 2 driven. 81 This mechanism involved downregulation of OX40 ligand on DCs, leading to less T H 2 cell polarization.",

            "text": "Recently, in a mouse model of influenza virus infection, infection of Ifnar1 2/2 mice resulted in higher levels of virusinduced lung eosinophilia, ILC2 recruitment, and higher levels of serum IgE. 82 In comparative human studies, ILC2s cultured with IL-33 and IL-17 produced the T H 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-9, which were downregulated in the presence of IFN-b. 82 This was the first study to show that, in a similar manner to T H 2 cells, innate lymphoid cells are also affected by innate interferons and that their type 2 function might be increased in an environment that lacks interferon and hence this important negative regulatory mechanism. These mechanisms are shown in Fig 2. Conversely, ex vivo and mouse model evidence strongly suggests that T H 2 pathways have potent negative effects on the induction of innate interferons by viruses. For example, cross-linking Fc\u03b5RI on DCs before influenza virus or rhinovirus challenge downregulates IFN-a production. 28, 29 Blocking IgE function with omalizumab restored this defect and reduced the rate of AEs, showing for the first time outside an experimental infection setting 6 that ex vivo interferon measurements can predict clinical outcomes. 51 In a mouse model of pneumovirus infection, cockroach allergen exposure in early life followed by infection led to an asthma-like phenotype with impaired lung type I and type III interferon production. 83 Ex vivo, cultured, plasmacytoid dendritic cells pretreated with IL-33 showed reduced IFN-a levels on infection, along with reduced levels of IRF7, viperin, and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, an important signaling molecule in TLR7 function. These data further support the importance of TLR7 expression or function in impaired interferon production in immune cells.",

            "text": "In HBECs pretreatment with TGF-b, 59,84 IL-4, or IL-13 85 can reduce rhinovirus-induced IFN-b and/or IFN-l levels; this suppression is specific for interferons and does not inhibit proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, 85 which is consistent with studies of impaired interferon production in HBECs. 5, 36 Additionally, other non-T H 2 cytokines, such as IL-2, do not have this inhibitory effect on interferons, again highlighting the unique relationship between T H 2 cytokines and innate interferons, which is not simply an effect of any cytokine impairing the effect of another. Although the mechanism was not studied, it is possibly related to induced SOCS1 because SOCS1 is T H 2 inducible, its levels are increased in asthmatic patients, and it is a potent negative regulator of virus-induced interferon production. 63 Therefore establishing how T H 2 cytokines can impair virus-induced interferons is a priority, and the mechanism could be an important therapeutic target. A summary of mechanisms responsible for T H 2 pathway impairment of innate interferon production is shown in Fig 2. Because the overall evidence strongly underscores many potential mechanisms of counterregulation of T H 2 cytokines and type I and III interferons, it could be proposed that in patients with atopic or eosinophilic asthma, impaired interferon production is due to ongoing and uncontrolled T H 2-mediated inflammation. The observations of increased SOCS1 levels in biopsy specimens of asthmatic patients and that SOCS1 can directly suppress interferon induction 63 suggest a mechanism explaining why interferon levels ex vivo can be inversely associated with markers of T H 2 pathways. However, it is possible that impaired interferon production might not be limited strictly to patients with eosinophilic or T H 2-high asthma 31 and that other mechanisms could explain impaired interferon expression in asthmatic patients. Considering the evidence that impaired interferon production in asthmatic patients can be associated with atopic asthma and the growing wealth of studies using anti-T H 2 biologics, the above idea is a testable hypothesis, and future research should endeavor to examine the effects of T H 2 biologics in clinical trials on interferon expression in asthmatic patients in vivo.",

In the high-T H 2 subgroup, the rate of protocol-defined exacerbations was 60% lower in the lebrikizumab group than in the placebo group (P 5 .03). 86 Dupilumab, an mAb specific for the IL-4 receptor a chain, reduced AE rates by 87% in a study of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma with eosinophilia. 87 Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 antibody, reduced blood and sputum eosinophil numbers in a study focusing on prednisolone-taking asthmatic patients with persistent sputum eosinophilia. Mepolizumab also significantly reduced rates of AEs and prednisolone use and improved the median time to AEs by 8 weeks. 88 In another study of patients with eosinophilic asthma with a history of severe AEs, mepolizumab significantly reduced AE rates versus placebo up to 52%. 89 The anti-IL-5 receptor a antibody benralizumab significantly reduced rates of AEs up to 57% in asthmatic patients with high baseline levels of eosinophils. 90 Furthermore reslizumab, another anti-IL-5 antibody, showed a 58% reduction in AE rates, which was not significant versus placebo in patients with poorly controlled eosinophilic asthma, 91 and pitrakinra, an IL-4 variant that inhibits IL-4/IL-13 signaling, reduced the decrease in FEV 1 versus placebo during allergen challenge in atopic asthmatic patients. 92 Small molecules targeting chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T H 2 cells have additionally shown promise increasing FEV 1 93 and reducing eosinophilic airways inflammation, 94 and a DNAzyme-targeted GATA-3 has improved FEV 1 and reduced sputum eosinophil numbers and plasma IL-5 levels versus placebo in patients with eosinophilic asthma. 95 These results are encouraging and show proof of concept that targeting T H 2 pathways in atopic asthmatic patients or asthmatic patients with eosinophilia can lead to improvements in AEs.",

In a study of children and young adults with persistent asthma, omalizumab significantly reduced the proportion of participants who had 1 or more exacerbations by 18% and also reduced the number of days with asthma symptoms. 96 Another study in asthmatic children investigated the effects of omalizumab on AE rates, and omalizumab was found to improve AE rates by approximately 5-fold. 51 IFN-a from rhinovirus-infected PBMC cultures was also sampled before and after omalizumab treatment (4 months). Although there was no difference between omalizumab and placebo before treatment commenced, after randomization, the omalizumab group had improved IFN-a induction after rhinovirus infection, and this increase was related to the AE rate. Based on median IFN-a production in the omalizumab group, those subjects with IFN-a levels of less than the median had an almost 6-fold increase in AE rates compared with those who displayed a higher than median IFN-a response. This observation is of importance because it is the first evidence that measuring IFN-a response ex vivo can predict clinical outcomes in a clinical trial and provocatively suggests that a benefit of anti-T H 2 pathway treatment might be due to restoring an impaired interferon response and increasing antiviral immunity.",

Increased viral replication accompanied by impaired interferon production in lung cells of asthmatic patients was first observed in 2005, 5 and since then, a number of studies have repeated these initial observations, although some have not observed this. This work culminated in the first trial of inhaled IFN-b for asthma in 2014, 37 which showed a significant effect in a subpopulation with more severe disease.",

The inconsistency of some studies investigating interferon levels in asthmatic patients is likely due to subtle differences in laboratory techniques, including preparation and use of both viruses and cells, as well as patient recruitment and characterization. Furthermore, this phenotype in HBECs might be unstable. There is a paucity of studies measuring interferon levels ex vivo, and the study by Teach et al 51 has shown that this is possible and meaningful. A further point is that future investigations of inhaled IFN-b could benefit from identifying those with impaired interferon responses as a preferred study population; however, whether this is a stable phenotype remains unproved.",

TLR7's role in determining interferon induction in immune cells is also encouraging, tempting speculation that a dedicated GWAS in poor interferon responders versus good responders might be a worthwhile pursuit. Although the effects of IgE cross-linking on virus-induced interferon 28 Regarding anti-T H 2 biologics, we have proposed herein that the benefit of these therapies on AEs, which largely have a viral cause, could be through restoration of defective antiviral immunity, thus protecting the host from more severe infections that progress to the lower airway. Ex vivo studies, mouse models, and now clinical trials 51 provide conclusive evidence that type I and III innate interferons and T H 2 pathways have antagonistic effects on each other, providing a mechanism or mechanisms explaining how asthmatic patients might benefit from T H 2-targeting therapies. The restoration of a defective innate interferon response could be a novel mechanism of action, and future studies of anti-IL-5, anti-IL-4, and anti-IL-13 biologics should endeavor to examine this in detail. This is a testable hypothesis; however, without conclusive human evidence linking interferon responses to AE-related clinical outcomes, this novel hypothesis will remain underappreciated.",

            "text": "Overview of additive or synergistic effects of allergen exposure and viral infection driving both pro-T H 2 and IgE/T H 2 inflammation. Viral infection damages the epithelial barrier and results in the pro-T H 2 cytokines IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. These cytokines act on ILC2s, DCs, and T H 2 cells, resulting in production of the T H 2 cytokines IL-13, IL-4, and IL-5. These cytokines have a central role in allergic asthma: IL-4 and IL-13 drive antibody class-switching to IgE in B cells, IL-13 can act also on airway smooth muscle cells, causing bronchoconstriction and contributing to airway remodeling, and IL-5 contributes to eosinophil production. Actions of IL-4 and IL-13 and viruses on airway epithelial cells can induce the eotaxins that attract eosinophils and the chemokines macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which attract T H 2 cells into the airway. IgE cross-linking by allergen on mast cells produces histamine, leukotrienes, and the prostaglandins PGD 2 and PGE 2 , which further promote bronchoconstriction. PGD 2 binds chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T H 2 cells (CRTH2) and activates basophils, T H 2 cells, and ILC2s. Viruses can also cause oxidative stress, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) production can lead to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1a/b, TNF, and IL-6. This generally results in neutrophilic inflammation and activation of macrophages. Allergen-induced IL-1a can also promote the pro-T H 2 response and lead to further IL-33 production and activation of ILC2s.

T H 2 cytokines can negatively regulate virus-induced interferons; cross-linking of cell-bound IgE on DCs prevents virus-induced IFN-a on infection; pretreatment of HBECs with IL-4, IL-13, or TGF-b results in low IFN-b and IL-29 induction on infection; and IL-33 can act on DCs and reduce IRAK levels and hence IFN-a induction on infection. Interferons can suppress T H 2 responses; pretreatment of T cells with IFN-a/b reduces GATA-3 and IL-5 levels in T H 2 cells; viruses or TLR7 agonists produce IFN-a/b from DCs, which act on T H 2 cells to reduce level of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13; and IFN-b pretreatment of ILC2s causes a reduction in IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Finally, IL-28A (IFN-l) acts on DCs to reduce OX40 ligand and prevent T H 2 cell expression of IL-5 and IL-13. BECs, Bronchial epithelial cell; pDCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells.",
