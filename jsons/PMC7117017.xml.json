            "text": "Nucleic acid aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules, generally 25 to 60 bases in length, identified from pools of random-sequence oligonucleotides (ONs) by an in vitro selection process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) [1], introduced in the early 90s independently by the research groups of Gold and Szostak [2], [3], [4]. Thanks to their unique three-dimensional folding, aptamers can recognize a wide range of molecular targets including proteins, small molecules, ions, whole cells and even entire organisms, such as viruses or bacteria, with affinities, expressed in terms of dissociation constants (K\nd), ranging from picomolar (pM) to micromolar (\u03bcM) [5], [6], [7]. Each ON aptamer can adopt a unique subset of 3D structures defined by the combination of base-pairing, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, sugar puckering, as well as electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and non-canonical intra-molecular interactions. This structural complexity results in a high probability of selecting an aptamer that can strongly and specifically interact with the target of interest through hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, van der Waals, hydrophobic and/or electrostatic interactions. The high affinity and selectivity for the target, as well as the multiplicity of possible target types, make aptamers a valid alternative to antibodies in a wide variety of applications, from therapeutics (as drugs or drug-delivery systems) to diagnostic and sensing devices [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Nucleic acid aptamers exhibit significant advantages over antibodies, such as smaller size, lower immunogenicity, remarkable stability in a wide range of pH (\u2248 4\u20139) and temperature; in addition, aptamers allow an easy control of their folding processes, which, even after prolonged denaturation, are typically reversible upon restoring the native conditions. In addition, once selected, oligonucleotide-based aptamers are easily obtained in animal-free systems by chemical synthesis. This allows also easily performing ad hoc tailored chemical modifications that can increase aptamer chemical and biological stability and bring the production costs well below those of antibodies [16], [17].",

During these processes, the best aptamers for the selected target are enriched and the initial ON library complexity is decreased (Fig. 1\n, left).",

Aptamer libraries can be derived from chemical synthesis, genomic DNA [18] or transcriptomic sources [19], and can be realized with deoxyribo-, ribo-, or modified nucleotides [20], [21], [22], [23]. Modified nucleotides are primarily used to increase the chemical and enzymatic stability of aptamers, but can also contribute to greatly broaden their chemical diversity, improving their binding affinity and specificity for a selected target. Among the methods developed for expanding the repertoire of nucleobase-modified aptamers, recently Mayer et al. introduced click chemistry protocols to generate a novel class of modified aptamers, termed \u201cclickmers\u201d, fully compatible with the common steps of established in vitro selection procedures (click-SELEX) [23]. Many enzymes that can \u201cread\u201d or \u201cwrite\u201d aptamer sequences containing unnatural nucleotides are available [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] and methods that identify the precise location of these nucleotides within an aptamer sequence are known as well [27], [28], [29].",

            "text": "After incubation of the library with the selected target, partition of bound from unbound sequences can be obtained in different ways (Fig. 1, right side). Typically, heterogeneous methods have been applied for this purpose: (i) filtration, based on differential retention of protein\u2013DNA complexes and free DNA on a membrane; (ii) affinity chromatography, in which the protein is immobilized on a surface and retains oligonucleotides on the basis of their binding affinity, while the unbound sequences are discarded; or (iii) magnetic beads-based separation, in which a magnetic separator is employed for partitioning the unbound ONs from the beads-bound target-aptamer complex [34]. These surface-based techniques suffer from non-specific adsorption of free ONs to the surface of the matrix, reducing the efficiency of partitioning and leading to the necessity of multiple rounds as well as negative selection steps. Furthermore, the immobilization process used in heterogeneous partitioning techniques can negatively affect protein structure, so potentially reducing the biological relevance of the selected oligonucleotide [34]. Thus, homogeneous methods are highly desirable for the selection of aptamers for protein targets, especially in case of aptamers developed for therapeutic applications. As an alternative to surface-based methods, kinetic capillary electrophoresis (KCE) techniques have been described as very efficient systems in aptamer selection. These are based on the separation of the aptamer\u2013target complexes from unbound ONs according to their different electrophoretic mobility in an electric field [35]. In particular, non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM) is the most widely used KCE method for the highly efficient selection of aptamers, allowing also to accurately calculate the binding parameters (K\nd, k\non and k\noff) of the aptamer\u2013target interaction [36], [37]. The efficiency of partitioning by NECEEM is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional surface-based selection techniques [36]. As a result, library enrichment can be completed in as few as 2\u20134 rounds of NECEEM-based SELEX, in contrast to the 10\u201330 rounds typically required in SELEX based on heterogeneous partitioning. Ideally, in an electric field, the zones of free DNA, DNA\u2013target complex, and free target are separated. The lower the K\nd value, the more time the aptamers spend within the target, and the closer is their migration time to that of the free target. In contrast, the higher the K\nd value, the more time the aptamers spend as free DNA molecules, and the more similar is their migration time with respect to that of free DNA [37]. The mobility of DNA\u2013protein complexes is typically intermediate between those of the DNA and protein alone, and thus the whole electropherogram displays the various components in the following order: (1) free protein; (2) specific DNA\u2013protein complex (with low K\nd values); (3) non-specific DNA\u2013protein complex (with high K\nd values); and (4) free DNA. A fraction collection approach in capillary electrophoresis SELEX (FCE-SELEX) allows partition and collection of the aptamer\u2013target complexes from the original DNA library, as illustrated in Fig. 2\n, ensuring no aptamer is missing [38].",

With increasingly stringent conditions (shorter incubation times, higher temperatures, higher ON/target ratios) in successive rounds of SELEX, the high-affinity oligonucleotides are enriched. For a number of years, the classical PCR amplification protocol has been used. However, the conventional PCR amplification method was found to quickly degrade the products and rapidly form by-products through the formation of heterodimers [39]. Additionally, DNA amplification by conventional PCR is susceptible of nonspecific primer hybridization, primer dimers, amplification bias [40], and potential aptamer loss due to their adhesion on the walls of PCR tubes [41]. A number of approaches have been proposed over the years to mend the aforementioned inefficiencies of PCR amplification in SELEX [34]. More recently, a SELEX method which combines the NECEEM partitioning with a highly efficient amplification procedure, termed Emulsion PCR (ePCR), has been described [42]. ePCR allows compartmentalizing and miniaturizing the PCR reaction in vitro, by vigorously mixing mineral oil and surfactants with a conventional PCR mix, creating a local homogeneous-like PCR amplification environment. These conditions reduce primer-dimer formation, nonspecific primer hybridization and amplification bias, i.e. the major causes of PCR inefficiencies in early amplification cycles [39], [40], [41], allowing increasing the product yield due to the close proximity in micelles of the template DNA, the primers and polymerase, each in high local concentration.",

Once identified, the putative aptamers can be synthesized and analyzed to determine the target affinity and specificity of binding vs. other possible targets. Structural characterization is important for optimizing the aptamer features after its selection from a pool. Then, computational analysis can predict the nucleotide bases important for ligand binding and biophysical studies by NMR or X-ray crystallography can identify the molecular details of the aptamer\u2013target interaction. These biophysical analyses, by far the most definitive and informative techniques for resolving tertiary structures, are however limited to buffer conditions compatible with data collection. The interaction sites between an aptamer and its target can be established by biochemical assays such as nuclease protection [47] and UV-cross-linking assays [48], performed on the selected ON in the presence or absence of the target [49]. Information on the binding pocket and the bases critical for target contacts are essential for aptamer optimization. This provides a map that guides the insertion of modifications to retain or increase the binding affinity while altering aptamer properties such as size or structural stability.",

            "text": "Another important consideration for aptamer development is that the target used during the selection process should be identical to the \u201cnatural\u201d one, i.e., in the case of a protein target, for example, very similar to the protein found in vivo. This requirement is frequently fulfilled using, as SELEX targets, proteins that might only be modified with a short tag. It is often more difficult to ensure identity when the \u201cnatural target\u201d is a membrane protein or a small molecule that has to be modified to allow its immobilization for the SELEX capture protocols. Indeed, isolated membrane proteins used for SELEX may lack the normal glycosylation pattern or the association with natural partners such as other proteins, lipids or carbohydrates, that influence/modulate their structure, the availability of surface docking sites and the affinity for aptamers preventing the access to the natural target [50]. To address some of these problems, selection techniques like cell-SELEX and tissue-SELEX have been developed [51], [52], [53], [54]. These methods provide an effective approach for the identification of new biomarkers as disease signals in diagnosis and therapy. However, the cell-SELEX system provides low aptamer enrichment efficiency because many off-target surface biomarkers are co-expressed on the cells of interest [55]. To overcome this challenge, a modified SELEX method that combines the cell-based SELEX with purified protein-based SELEX techniques was introduced (hybrid SELEX) [55], [56]. In addition to the hybrid-SELEX approach, other modified cell-SELEX technologies have been developed, such as internalized cell-SELEX, designed to select functional aptamers that can be internalized by human cells [55], [57], [58], [59], [60] and FACS-SELEX, that is used to eliminate dead cells that non-specifically bind nucleic acids and affect subsequent aptamer selection results [55], [61].",

However, with the many advances made to improve the efficiency of selection and to increase the affinity, specificity, and bioavailability of aptamers, the future of therapeutic aptamers looks extremely promising. To date, Macugen (pegaptanib sodium), selected against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is the only existing aptamer-based drug, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in humans, also undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of diabetic macular oedema [62]. Nevertheless, new aptamer-based candidate drugs are undertaking clinical trials [9], [32], and this gives us hope that increasingly more aptamers and aptamer-like compounds will be approved as drugs in the next future.",

This apparent contrast can be easily solved considering the extremely high polymorphism of G-quadruplex structures. In fact G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic acid conformations adopted by guanine-rich oligonucleotides. The core G-quadruplex unit is the guanine tetrad, a cyclic planar arrangement of four guanines linked through Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds. Stacking of two or more guanine tetrads generates a G-quadruplex motif, which is further stabilized by cations hosted in the central cavity of the G4 [65], [66] (Fig. 3\n).",

The apparently rigid G4 structure is instead rather plastic and can fit into widely different nucleic acid architectures. Multiple elements participate in conferring G4 structures a high level of adaptability: 1) the intramolecular or intermolecular character of the system; 2) the parallel or antiparallel direction of the guanine-rich tracts in the G4 assembly; 3) the length, sequence and direction of the loops; 4) the syn or anti guanine orientation around the N-glycosidic bonds; and 5) the number of consecutive G-quartets formed. The body of evidence thus far gained indicates that intramolecular G4 conformations are generally favoured, with loops consisting of 2\u20134 bases, often adopting an antiparallel arrangement with alternated syn/anti orientations. The preferred number of consecutive G-quartets is 2 or 3, to avoid excessive conformational stiffness. Furthermore, other individual differentiating elements can be additionally present in the G4-based aptamers, such as bulges [67], mixed G:A:G:A, G:T:G:T and G:C:G:C tetrads [68], [69], G-vacancies [70], A-tetrads sandwiched between G-tetrads [71] or A:G4 pentads [72]. An additional level of structural diversity is related to the possibility of raising both DNA and RNA G4-based aptamers [73], [74].",

Discovered by coincidence and not by conventional SELEX approaches [80], AS1411 (Advanced Cancer Therapeutics, formally named as ACT-GRO-777) is the most advanced and first-in-class anticancer aptamer having entered clinical trials. AS1411 is a G4-forming 26-mer DNA aptamer, highly stable and resistant to nuclease degradation, targeting nucleolin. Nucleolin is a ubiquitous and multifunctional protein playing essential roles in cell survival, growth and proliferation [78]. AS1411 binds to the external domain of nucleolin, which is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. Therefore, AS1411 is able to specifically recognize and then be taken up by cancer cells [81]. The internalized aptamer-nucleolin complex inhibits DNA replication, resulting in accumulation of cells in S phase and cytotoxicity against cancer cells [82]. Recently, a novel mechanism of action for AS1411 has been proposed: AS1411 is internalized via nucleolin-mediated macropinocytosis, the internalized aptamer-nucleolin complex hyperstimulates macropinocytosis, which then causes non-apoptotic cell death, known as methuosis [83].",

Its sequence is d(TGTGGGGGTGGACGGGCCGGGTAGA), which folds into a stable G-quadruplex structure. On this basis, a truncated mutant of Vap7 was designed (V7t1) in which the guanine tracts necessary to form the G-quartets were conserved. V7t1 folds into several G4 structures [93] and strongly binds VEGF-165 with low nanomolar K\nd values. Using in silico maturation to further increase the aptamer binding affinity, a class of mutants of V7t1 was designed; from these studies, the best aptamer selected was 3R02, having a 16-fold higher affinity for the target than V7t1 (K\nd\n = 300 pM) [94].",

The hypothesized mechanism of action is the following: the complex is efficiently taken up by cells exploiting the binding to nucleolin and, after light exposure, the activation of TMPyP4 destroys only the cells carrying the internalized complex. In vitro studies have shown that TMPyP4, when conjugated with AS1411, preferentially accumulates in breast cancer cells than in epithelium normal cells. Furthermore, the photodamage produced by this conjugate is overall more extensive in cancer cells than in normal cells. These results proved that the delivery and uptake of TMPyP4 are effectively mediated by the specific interaction of the AS1411-TMPyP4 complex with nucleolin.",

            "text": "The overall analysis of the known G4-forming therapeutic aptamers provides an interesting picture, from which some general conclusions can be drawn [143]. First of all, a significant number of aptamers selective against cancer cells adopt a G4 structure as a preferential conformation. The presence of a G4 folding appears to be an essential structural motif for aptamers endowed with cancer-selective antiproliferative activity. Upon screening 11 oligonucleotide combinatorial libraries, differing in nucleobase composition and length, Bates et al. found that only the G-rich libraries showing features consistent with G4 formation strongly inhibited cancer cell growth, in contrast not affecting healthy cells [144]. Then, the parallel G4 topology seems to be largely prevailing among these bioactive aptamers. One remarkable example is the nucleolin-binding aptamer AS1411, advanced to Phase II clinical trials against renal cell carcinoma [80], which, even if present as a mixture of different monomeric and even dimeric G4 conformations, essentially prefers parallel structures [145]. In another study, investigating the antiproliferative effects of G4-forming aptamers, Shangguan et al. suggested that the intramolecular parallel G4 structure may be a key feature for cellular protein recognition, allowing efficient cell uptake through endosome/lysosome pathways [146]. This study was carried out on a number of parallel G4 structures, including putative G4-forming sequences from the human genome. These findings support the idea that structure-activity relationship analyses can speed up the identification of G4 scaffolds useful for the design of optimized therapeutically active aptamers. Thus, aptamer selection can be performed using partially randomized G-rich oligonucleotide libraries combining SELEX with rational design methods. However, in some cases, even minor mutations in G4 sequences may have dramatic effects on aptamer stability and/or activity [147], [148], [149], [150], inducing marked alterations in the G4 topology (e.g., an intramolecular antiparallel G4 can be converted into an intermolecular parallel one [151]) or causing the aptamer to target different epitopes of the protein [120]. Thus, the randomization process is always a compromise between the need for the highest sequence permutation and for a stable G4-folding [152]. In the case of an intermolecular scaffold, the combinatorial libraries usually contain several consecutive guanines (G-runs) with randomized flanks [98]. In the case of an intramolecular scaffold, the G4 core is typically kept intact, while the loops are randomized.",

An active G4 module can be linked to a duplex motif to get a hybrid structure with improved thermodynamic stability [153], [154]. Alternatively, polyvalent aptamers [118] can be obtained by conjugating similar or different G4 modules (homo-polyvalent or hetero-polyvalent aptamers, respectively), able to recognize distinct sites on the same target protein [123], [155], [156] or different targets [157]. A synergistic effect between the linked domains is typically expected with polyvalent systems [158]; in this case, however, the success of the overall strategy critically depends on the choice of the linker between the modules. In this context, combinatorial libraries with randomized linkers and fixed active modules have been fruitfully used [159].",

            "text": "Another central issue is that, due to the abundance of G4 motifs in the human genome [160], all playing diverse regulatory roles [161], a variety of genomic G4-forming motifs (particularly those located in gene promoters) can be regarded as potential candidate aptamers. In other words, G4-forming aptamers can be designed taking inspiration from natural nucleic acid substrates and then used as their competitors for endogenous G4-binding regulatory proteins, ultimately affecting gene expression and normal cell functions. In this regard, a valuable example is the G4-forming oligonucleotide carrying the sequence located in the insulin promoter, found to recognize insulin and insulin-like growth factor 2 [162], [163]. A promoter-derived aptamer selection method (G4PAS) has been successfully used to identify G4s with good affinities for VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor-AA and retinoblastoma protein RB1 [164]. Native and modified ON mimics of G4s from RAS proto-oncogenes are able to compete with DNA-protein complexes that regulate transcription and therefore can be used as decoys for transcription factors [165], [166]. Rational design of G4 decoys, first described by Xodo et al., appears to be a very promising strategy in anticancer research [167]. In parallel, it can be expected that new, more effective G4-forming antiviral agents will be developed as a consequence of the rapid progress in the studies on the G4-forming sequences of HIV-1, Epstein-Barr virus and Papilloma Virus genomes and their participation in viral life cycles [96], [97]. Hopefully, more and more gene-inspired G4-forming aptamers will be discovered in the near future.",

The sensing process of aptasensors is similar to other biosensors: the aptamer recognizes its target, and the signal transducer transfers the recognition information into measurable signals. The aptamers can be immobilized (heterogeneous) or used in solution (homogenous phase) [169]. Once immobilized, the aptamers are able to release targets upon washing with different buffers, thus allowing in principle to reuse an aptasensor several times. Multiple sensing strategies have been developed till now, combined with various transducers, such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence, colorimetry, electrophoresis, electrochemistry, electrochemiluminescence (ECL), field-effect transistor, and so on. These aptasensors can be generally divided into two classes: \u201clabeled\u201d and \u201clabel-free\u201d sensors [170]. The most recent developments in the use of aptamers in diagnostics and imaging have been recently reviewed by Neerathilingam et al., who have discussed in detail the applications of aptamers for the detection of infective agents, antigens/toxins (bacteria) and biomarkers (cancer) [171].",

            "text": "The most studied G4-forming aptamers in many diagnostic applications are the thrombin binding aptamers (TBAs), two short DNA sequences of 15 (TBA15) and 29 (TBA29) nucleotides in length, relatively easy and inexpensive to synthesize and able to recognize with high affinity and specificity the fibrinogen- and heparin-recognition exosite on thrombin, respectively (exosites I and II) [117]. Despite the high biological significance of thrombin as a target, both TBA15 and TBA29, properly modified to fulfill the desired detection process, have been widely used essentially as a proof-of-concept to verify the feasibility of the proposed analytical method. The success of TBAs as model systems in the development of detection assays is due to several factors, such as: 1) the high affinity and specificity for the target; 2) the availability of two G4-based thrombin aptamers, each targeting a specific exosite on the protein in a non-interferring manner, giving the possibility to perform sandwich-type assays; 3) the rapid and unambiguous switching of the aptamer structures triggered by thrombin binding, and 4) the catalytic activity of the protein, still present after the binding event for both aptamers. The scientific literature has plenty of research studies for the detection of thrombin. They are based either on very complicated multi-recognition systems or on rapid and easy methods, and can be grouped in homogenous- or heterogeneous-phase assays, using labeled or label-free, as well as enzyme-assisted assays. For a detailed recent review, illustrating the development of more than one hundred analytical techniques centered on the TBA-thrombin system, see also ref. [172]. We report here an update on recent TBA-based sensing systems, discussing in parallel other, less recent assays, selected on the basis of their apparent efficiency and simplicity.",

The QDs can be \u201cactivated\u201d with fluorescence enhancement by adding extra Cd2 + to the solution in a basic medium; the positively charged Cd2 +-activated CdTe QDs interact with the negatively charged TBA, leading to fluorescence quenching; when thrombin is added, TBA forms a G-quadruplex structure through specific interaction with its target, releasing the QDs with a recovery of the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4b). A linear response for thrombin has been observed in the range from 1.4 nM to 21 nM, with a detection limit of 0.70 nM. This method is easy to perform since covalent modifications or immobilizations of the aptamer are avoided, can reduce background signal and improve sensitivity due to the turn-on sensing mode, and can be performed directly on real serum samples, not requiring pre-treatments of the serum matrix.",

Due to the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the aptamer and CNDs, the energy donor and acceptor are taken into close proximity, leading to the phosphorescence quenching of TBA QD-donors. With the introduction of thrombin onto the TBA-QDs-CNDs system in \u201coff state\u201d, the phosphorescence is \u201cturned on\u201d due to the formation of G4-thrombin complexes, which release the energy acceptor CNDs from the energy donors (Fig. 4c).

The proposed aptasensor has also been used to monitor thrombin in complex biological fluids, including serum and plasma, with satisfactory recovery ranging from 96.8 to 104.3%.

Upon thrombin addition, the target strongly interacts with the TBA probe displacing the cationic polymer, which in turn induces gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aggregation; this event produces a visible change in color from red-wine to blue-purple, detectable also by naked eye (Fig. 4e). This colorimetric sensor could detect thrombin up to 1 pM with high selectivity also in the presence of other interfering proteins and was successfully applied to determine thrombin levels in human serum samples.",

The system is composed of an Eu3 +-doped CdS nanocrystal (CdS:Eu NC) film on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as ECL emitter. AuNPs, labeled with a hairpin-DNA probe (ssDNA1, Fig. 5\n) containing TBA15, are linked on the NC film: an ECL quenching effect (off) is produced as a result of F\u00f6rster-resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the CdS:Eu NC film and the proximal AuNPs. Upon hybridization with a free ssDNA (ssDNA2) complementary to the hairpin, a duplex structure is formed and the AuNPs are pulled away from the CdS:Eu NC film, causing an ECL enhancement (on) due to the interactions of the excited CdS:Eu NCs with ECL-induced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in AuNPs at large separation. The addition of thrombin induces ssDNA1 to form a G-quadruplex structure, displacing the ssDNA2 and allowing the AuNPs to get close to the CdS:Eu NC film again, eventually producing an enhanced ECL quenching (off). This \u201coff-on-off\u201d system showed a maximum 7.4-fold change of ECL intensity, due to the configuration transformation of ssDNA1, providing great sensitivity in thrombin detection in a wide detection range, from 50 aM to 1 pM.",

The strategy relies on the preferential adsorption of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to GO over aptamer-target complexes. The TBA-thrombin complex formation was monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using the guanine oxidation signal. In the absence of thrombin, the aptamers are adsorbed onto the surface of GO, leading to a strong background guanine oxidation signal. Conversely, in the presence of thrombin, the conformational transformation of TBA after incubation with the thrombin solution and formation of the aptamer-thrombin complexes, which have weak binding affinity for GO, leads to the desorption of TBA-thrombin complex from the electrode surface and significant oxidation signal decrease (Fig. 6\n). The selectivity of the biosensor was studied using other biological substances. The biosensor signal was proportional to the thrombin concentration from 0.1 to 10 nM with a detection limit of 0.07 nM.",

            "text": "Very important advances in the field of G4 aptasensors came from the discovery of a peroxidase activity associated with the G4-hemin complex (DNAzyme). Initially, in 1998, a specific aptamer binding iron (III)-protoporphyrin IX (hemin) was selected (PS2.M), which was a G-rich DNA sequence able to form a stable G-quadruplex structure [181]. It was demonstrated that the aptamer-hemin complex had significantly higher peroxidase activity than hemin alone, under physiological conditions, catalyzing (DNAzyme) the oxidation of 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiozoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with concomitant formation of the colored radical cation product ABTS\u2022\n+\n[181]. Its peroxidase activity was also significantly higher than that of a previously reported hemin-catalytic-antibody complex [182]. It was later realized that the RNA version of PS2.M (rPS2.M) also showed enhanced peroxidase activity, demonstrating that RNA-based aptamers can have a similar structure and function [183]. The intramolecular G-quadruplex structure was shown to play an important role in the peroxidase activity [184]. As a general DNA ligand with the porphyrin ring, hemin should bind also to other G-quadruplex families. This point was indeed investigated exploring the interactions between hemin and other G-quadruplex aptamers, discovering that most G4-forming aptamers were able to bind hemin, with different affinities depending on the type of G4 structure, and had peroxidase activity (DNAzyme) [185]. Regarding the sensing system, in addition to ABTS, many other compounds can also act as substrates being oxidized by H2O2 upon G4\u2013hemin complex catalysis, such as luminol to produce chemiluminescence [186] or chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer [187], 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) [188], etc. The peroxidase-mimicking activity of G4 DNAzyme is related to the topology and conformation of the G4 structure [189]: remarkably, parallel G-quadruplexes display much higher peroxidase activity than those displayed by hemin and antiparallel G-quadruplexes.",

During the blood sampling process, an anticoagulant buffer (citrate) containing the reversible active-site inhibitor argatroban (1, Fig. 10\n) is added to the blood sample containing thrombin (2, PDB 1DWC). Complex formation between argatroban and thrombin efficiently prevents irreversible inhibition of thrombin by endogenous thrombin inhibitors. Wells of streptavidin-coated microtiter modules, previously loaded with the 3\u2032-biotinylated anti-thrombin aptamer HD1\u201322 (3), that simultaneously targets exosites I and II of thrombin, are overlaid with plasma. After incubation and capturing of the argatroban-thrombin complex by HD1\u201322, the wells are washed to remove plasma remains and reversibly bound argatroban. Subsequently, a thrombin-specific peptide substrate, bearing an AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) fluorogenic probe (H-D-CHA-Ala-Arg-AMC, 4), is added to quantitatively determine the amount of functional active thrombin captured in the wells. Thus a supramolecular oligonucleotide-based enzyme capture assay for the sensitive detection of thrombin was developed in plasma, under routine clinical conditions [194].",

They are capable of simultaneously binding their protein target and hemin through two different modes. Most importantly, their corresponding hemin-DNA complexes reveal excellent peroxidase-like activities, higher than that of the reported hemin-PS2M DNAzyme. The potential of these systems in bioanalysis was demonstrated for AGRO100, which was applied to the chemiluminescence detection of nucleolin expressed at the surface of HeLa cells. Based on the specific AGRO100-nucleolin interaction, the surface-expressed nucleolin of HeLa cells is labeled in situ with the hemin-AGRO100 DNAzyme, and then determined in the luminol-H2O2 system (Fig. 11\n). Through this approach, the sensitive detection of total nucleolin expressed on the surface of about 6000 HeLa cells was accomplished [195].",

Structural studies have identified that the binding motif of the aptamer is an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion. For AGR2 detection, an allosteric molecular beacon, named AGR2-aMB, coupled with a fluorescence flow cytometry sensing system, was developed (Fig. 12\n). The AGR2-aMB is a single strand DNA consisting of a streptavidin (SA) aptamer sequence [197], a C14B1 sequence, a short sequence complementary to a small tract of the SA aptamer sequence, and a fluorophore. A stable hairpin structure is formed by intramolecular hybridization between the SA aptamer sequence and the complementary sequence, temporarily disabling the probe ability to bind with SA beads. Consequently, when incubated with SA beads, no probe can bind to SA beads, and the beads display very low fluorescence. In the presence of AGR2, however, the C14B1 sequence in the loop of aMB binds to the target sequence, in turn disrupting the hairpin structure to release the SA binding sequence, and thereby activating the binding affinity of the probe to SA beads. Thus, the AGR2-bound probe will bind to SA beads, which will strongly fluoresce due to FAM labeling of the probe. Target molecules can be detected and quantified by reading the fluorescence intensity of SA beads through a flow cytometer (Fig. 12).",

The protein target is a typical component of the cell wall of this gram-positive bacterium and also represents one of its virulence factors, rendering Protein A a suitable target for its detection.

It was demonstrated that PA#2/8 strongly binds to native and recombinant Protein A and clearly distinguishes its target from functional related proteins like Protein G and Protein L, which were not recognized. Remarkably, the aptamer does not bind to human serum albumin (HSA) used as unspecific control protein. ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate was then applied to each well, following a washing step (Fig. 13a). Successively, a 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution was added to each well and the optical density at 450 nm was measured. Similar experiments were performed by coating the wells with bacterial cells of Staphylococcus aureus to assess the binding ability of aptamer PA#2/8 and truncated variants to Protein A in an intact cell context. The results of the ELONA assay clearly demonstrate the specific recognition and binding of the aptamer to the cells via Protein A. PA#2/8 and its truncated variant PA#2/8[S1\u201358] were able to differentiate between the Protein A-producing S. aureus Cowan strain and the Protein A-deficient Wood46 strain (both as formaldehyde-fixed cells) or living E. coli as the negative control. Improvements of the ELONA assay in terms of binding results will be obtained by development of a sandwich or competitive assays (Fig. 13b and c), which could avoid the immobilization of the target cells and improve the assay handling.",

Many analytical methods make use of thrombin as target and TBA as a proof-of-principle of the proposed analytical method. The literature has plenty of research studies developing both very complicated multi-recognition systems and rapid, easy systems for the detection of thrombin. Indeed, in almost all the research works describing a new TBA-based sensing system, the authors claim that the realized assay can be potentially extended to other G4-forming aptamers for whatever target. Therefore, assays for the selective detection of other molecular targets than thrombin, using G4-forming aptamers, can be expected. However, we critically need high-resolution structures of other G4-forming aptamers in complex with their targets to fully answer the question whether TBA is typical or atypical, and how (and if) other G4-forming aptamers can afford the same high target specificity and binding affinity displayed by TBAs. New structures will help G4-forming aptamers to meet their therapeutic promise and analytical potential, leading to a new chapter in DNA G-quadruplex research.",

Complex formation between argatroban and thrombin efficiently prevents irreversible inhibition of thrombin by endogenous thrombin inhibitors. b) Wells of streptavidin-coated microtiter modules previously loaded with the 3\u2032-biotinylated anti-thrombin aptamer HD1\u201322 (3) that simultaneously targets exosites I and II of thrombin are overlaid with plasma. After incubation and capturing of the argatroban-thrombin complex by HD1\u201322, wells are washed to remove plasma remains and reversibly bound argatroban. Subsequently, a thrombin-specific peptide substrate, bearing an AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) fluorogenic probe (H-D-CHA-Ala-Arg-AMC, 4), is added to quantitatively determine the amount of functional active thrombin captured in the wells.",
