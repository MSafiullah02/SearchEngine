            "text": "Herpesviruses comprise a large and diverse order (Herpesvirales) of double stranded DNA viruses that infect humans and a wide range of other hosts (Pellet and Roizman, 2007, Virus Taxonomy: The Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses The Online (10th) Report of the ICTV, 2017). Human diseases caused by herpesviruses range from vesicular rashes to cancer. The order Herpesvirales is subdivided into three families, including the Herpesviridae, which is further subdivided into three subfamilies, the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae. Within subfamilies, groups of related herpesvirus species are classified into genera. The nine species of human herpesviruses are distributed across the three subfamilies and several genera (\nTable 1); these viruses are the main focus of this work. Prior studies found that the Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae are more closely related to each other than to Alphaherpesvirinae (Montague and Hutchison, 2000). In contrast to some other human viruses, the human herpesviruses have a long evolutionary history, with evidence suggesting that the primordial herpesvirus diverged into the Alpha-, Beta, and Gammaherpesvirinae approximately 180 million to 220 million years ago (McGeoch et al., 1995). Coupled with their genome complexity and the availability of numerous complete genome sequences, this deep evolutionary history makes herpesviruses a tractable and informative model to study virus genome evolution at the levels of gene duplication and protein domain rearrangement.",

Orthologs were defined by Fitch in 1970 as homologous genes in different species that diverged from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Genes that, either in the same or different species, diverged by a gene duplication have been termed paralogs (Fitch, 2000, Fitch, 1970). While the terms ortholog and paralog have no consistent functional implications (Jensen, 2001), orthologs are oftentimes considered more functionally similar than paralogs at the same level of sequence divergence. This has been termed the \u201cortholog conjecture\u201d, which remains a topic of active research (Altenhoff et al., 2012, Chen and Zhang, 2012, Nehrt et al., 2011, Rogozin et al., 2014), due to its importance for computational sequence functional analysis (Eisen, 1998, Zmasek and Eddy, 2002) and the significance of gene duplications for biological evolution (Zhang, 2003).",

            "text": "Many eukaryotic proteins, and by extension, proteins of eukaryotic viruses, are composed of multiple domains, components that can each have their own evolutionary history and functional implications. The architecture of a protein is a product of the ordered arrangement of its several domains and their overall tertiary structure. Evolutionarily, individual domains can combine with other partner domains, enabling formation of a vast number of domain combinations, even within the same species (Moore et al., 2008). Assembling multiple domains into a single protein creates a distinct entity that can be more than the sum of its constituent parts. The emergence of proteins with novel combinations of duplicated and then diverged domains is considered to be a major mechanism for rapid evolution of new functionality in eukaryotic genomes (Itoh et al., 2007, Peisajovich et al., 2010). It is especially important in the evolution of pathways, where novel linkages between existing domains may result in the rearrangement of pathways and their behaviors in the cell (Peisajovich et al., 2010). The modular structure of eukaryotic proteins provides a mechanism that enables evolutionarily-rapid differentiation and emergence of a multitude of novel protein functions from an initially limited array of functional domains. Proteins can gain (or lose) new domains via genome rearrangements, creating (or removing) domain combinations, in addition to modification of domains themselves by small-scale mutations (Patthy, 2003, Ye and Godzik, 2004).",

This analysis resulted in the classification of proteins into \u201cStrict Ortholog Groups\u201d (SOGs), in which all proteins are orthologous to each other (related by speciation events) and exhibit the same domain architecture. The SOG classification also enabled the development of an informative name convention for each SOG that includes information about the protein's function (if known) and a suffix indicating the taxonomic distribution of the protein. For example, an \u201caBG\u201d suffix would indicate that proteins of this group are found in some (but not all) human Alphaherpesvirinae species (lowercase \u201ca\u201d), and all human Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae species (uppercase \u201cB\u201d and \u201cG\u201d). Such suffixes allow for the quick understanding of presumed conserved protein function and minimal common genome across the Herpesviridae family. The SOG classification results have been made publicly available through the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) (Pickett et al., 2012) at https://www.viprbrc.org.",

Uracil DNA glycosylases are found in eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea, as well as in herpesviruses and poxviruses (Chen et al., 2002). Our phylogenomic analysis shows that for all nine human herpesviruses, uracil DNA glycosylase is well conserved and contains one Pfam domain, UDG (uracil DNA glycosylase superfamily). In addition, the gene tree for human herpesvirus uracil DNA glycosylases (\nFig. 1B) precisely recapitulates the herpesvirus species tree (Fig. 1A); therefore, this protein family can be inferred to have evolved from a single common ancestor and without any gene duplications or domain rearrangements (see Table 2 for virus-specific gene names).",

This sequence variant was identified in HCMV strains isolated from Chinese patients (Shiu et al., 1994) and is identified in Pfam as \u201cHCMVantigenic_N domain\u201d. In our global hmmscan analysis (applying the same threshold of E = 10\u22126 for every Pfam domain) E-value support for presence of this domain in some strains is strong (E < 10\u201322) and matching over the entire Pfam model while other HCMV strains do not exhibit significant sequence similarity with this domain. It has been suggested that this domain polymorphism may be implicated in HCMV-induced immunopathogenesis, as well as in strain-specific behaviors, such as tissue-tropism and the ability to establish persistent or latent infections (Pignatelli et al., 2004). In our new systemic naming approach (see below) we term the SOG of the protein with HCMVantigenic_N domain \u201cGlycoprotein B_ ABG.b\u201d, whereas all other proteins fall into the \u201cGlycoprotein B_ ABG.AbG\u201d SOG.",

Cellular family B DNA polymerases are the main polymerases involved with nuclear DNA replication and repair in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and include DNA polymerases II and B, and polymerases \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03b5 (Garcia-Diaz and Bebenek, 2007). Family B DNA polymerases are also found in other dsDNA viruses, such as the insect Ascoviridae, and members of the Iridoviridae (e.g., fish lymphocystis disease virus) and Phycoviridae (e.g., chlorella virus) (Villarreal and DeFilippis, 2000). In addition to these two large and ubiquitous domains, Simplexvirus (which include human simplex virus 1 and 2) and Mardivirus also possess a small C-terminal domain, called the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit Pol (DNAPolymera_Pol) domain in Pfam (Zuccola et al., 2000), and are longer by about 45 aa on average than DNA polymerase proteins from other Herpesviridae. According to currently available genomic data, DNAPolymera_Pol is found in members of the Simplexvirus genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae. While varicella-zoster virus (Human herpesvirus 3) and other members of the Varicellovirus genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae possesses DNA polymerases that also tend to be longer, similarity of these protein regions to the DNAPolymera_Pol domain is low, using the current Pfam model for DNAPolymera_Pol (Pfam version 31.0). The function of this third domain is to mediate interaction between DNA polymerase and its cognate processivity factor (Bridges et al., 2000, Loregian et al., 2000) based on the observation that a peptide corresponding to the 27 C-terminal amino acids of HSV-1 DNA polymerase has been shown to inhibit viral replication by disrupting the interaction between DNA polymerase and UL42 (Digard et al., 1995, Loregian et al., 1999). In this context, it is interesting to note that the DNA polymerase processivity factors are only distantly-related across the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae (see below). It is therefore conceivable that the interactions of Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae DNA polymerase processivity factors with their corresponding DNA polymerases (which lack a DNAPolymera_Pol domain) is different in nature than for Alphaherpesvirinae. As for Varicellovirus it is unclear whether they possess a functional DNAPolymera_Pol domain, and a definitive answer will require similar biochemical assays as have been performed for HSV-1.",

By comparing this gene tree with a species tree for human Herpesviridae (Fig. 1A), we can infer three gene duplication events (marked as red squares in Fig. 4), resulting in four groups of orthologous genes: UL33/U12, US27, U51/ORF74, and US28. In our new nomenclature (see below), we call the first group \u201cG-protein coupled receptor homolog UL33/U12_B\u201d because it is found in all four human Betaherpesvirinae species (uppercase B suffix). The second group is called \u201cG-protein coupled receptor homolog US27_b\u201d as it is found in some human Betaherpesvirinae (lowercase b suffix). The third group is called \u201cG-protein coupled receptor homolog U51/ORF74_bg\u201d because it found in some human Betaherpesvirinae and in some human Gammaherpesvirinae (lowercase \u201cbg\u201d suffix). The fourth group is called \u201cEnvelope protein US28_b\u201d. No orthologous genes were found in the human Alphaherpesvirinae. Whenever available, we base our names preferably on (Mocarski, 2007) or the \u201cRecommended name\u201d (under \u201cProtein names\u201d) from the UniProtKB database (Bateman et al., 2017). For reasons of consistency and objectivity, we used an automated approach to root all trees by mid-point rooting. It is possible, that the true root for the 7-transmembrane domain proteins tree is at the base of the U51-ORF74 subtree. In this case there would be only two duplications in the tree, but still the same four ortholog groups: U51/ORF74, US28, US27, UL33/U12. Functionally, all these proteins appear to be hijacked human proteins that are being used by the virus to modulate the host immune system. In particular, many of them appear to act as chemokine (orphan) receptors (Casarosa et al., 2003, Casarosa et al., 2001, Isegawa et al., 1998, Murphy, 2001, Zhen et al., 2005) (\nFig. 5).",

Unfortunately, the phylogenetic signal across this group of protens is weak, thus some support values are low. Two groups of US22 orthologs span all four human betaherpesviruses: CMV tegument protein UL23 is likely to have orthologs in HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7 (Roseolovirus) Protein U3 (\u201cTegument protein UL23/Protein U3_B\u201d). Similarly, CMV Tegument protein UL43 is likely to be orthologous to HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7 (Roseolovirus) Protein U25 (\u201cTegument protein UL43/Protein U25_B\u201d). U3 and U25 are paralogous towards each other, as they are connected by a gene duplication, as are HCMV UL23 and 43. Four groups of orthologs specific to Roseolovirus are Tegument protein DR1, Tegument protein DR6, Protein U7, and Protein U17/U16. In U17/U16 proteins, it is unclear whether they possess a second US22 domain, as the similarity to this domain is weak to the point of insignificance. In contrast, U7 proteins possess at least three US22 domains and an additional C-terminal Herpes_U5 domain. Proteins U7 are most closely related to CMV UL29, but differ in their domain architecture (lack of Herpes_U5 domain). Thus CMV UL29 forms its own species-specific group of orthologs. Numerous proteins with US22 domains are specific to CMV (and thus all paralogous to each other) given current data: apoptosis inhibitor UL38, early nuclear protein HWLF1, tegument protein UL26, US24, protein UL24, UL29, UL36, US23, US26, protein IRS1, and protein TRS1.",

As new genome sequence data become available, the SOG data in ViPR is continuously updated in order to keep current with the ever expanding universe of Herpesvirus protein sequences. In addition, SOG annotations in ViPR will be expanded to include non-human Herpesviruses in the future. SOG data is also available for Pox- and Coronaviruses in ViPR, and will be applied to other virus families in the future.",

The second part (after the period) relates to entire DAs. \u201c.
