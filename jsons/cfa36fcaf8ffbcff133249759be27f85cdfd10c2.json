Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, human activities are largely restricted in many regions in India since mid-March of 2020, and it is a progressing experiment to testify effectiveness of restricted emissions. In this study, concentrations of six criteria pollutants, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , CO, NO 2 , ozone and SO 2 during March 16th to April 14th from 2017 to 2020 in 22 cities covering different regions of India were analysed. Overall, around 43, 31, 10, and 18% decreases in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and NO 2 in India were observed during lockdown period compared to previous years. While, there were 17% increase in O 3 and negligible changes in SO 2 . The air quality index (AQI) reduced by 44, 33, 29, 15 and 32% in north, south, east, central and western India, respectively. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years. The mean excessive risks of PM reduced by~52% nationwide due to restricted activities in lockdown period. To eliminate the effects of possible favourable meteorology, the WRF-AERMOD model system was also applied in Delhi-NCR with actual meteorology during the lockdown period and an un-favourable event in early November of 2019 and results show that predicted PM 2.5 could increase by only 33% in unfavourable meteorology. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that even during unfavourable meteorology, a significant improvement in air quality could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented.",

However, the peak PM 2.5 concentrations during episodes in winter did not reduce due to unfavourable meteorology (Wang et al., 2019) . Similarly, Zhang et al. (2014) estimated~33% reduction in nitrate in eastern US by emission control was offset by meteorology.

While, the first confirmed case in India was on January 30th, 2020, the first international travel advisory posing restrictions on travel to China, Republic of Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan was issued on March 11th of after the country saw sudden jump in COVID-19 cases on March 4th (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). Southern state of India, Kerala, which was initially the most effected state imposed curtails on mass gatherings on March 10th. Starting from March 16th all places of mass gatherings such as institutions, shopping malls and theatres were closed across the country. The first nationwide lockdown for fourteen hours was on March 22nd, which was followed by 21 days lockdown starting from March 24th. This lockdown enforces restrictions and self-quarantine measures, which reduce emissions from transportation and industries. The changes in air pollution in this lockdown period can provide an insight into the achievability of air quality improvement when there are significant restrictions in emissions from many sources and gives regulators better plans to control air pollution.",

Similar conclusions can be derived for PM 2.5 and PM 10 in other regions. A slight increase in SO 2 concentrations was observed in 2020 compared to previous year.

In southern India, clear decrease in NO, NO 2 and O 3 was observed during the lockdown period, while increase in CO was observed. Increases in O 3 and CO and decreases in NO and NO 2 were observed in central India. Most cities in northern, western and southern regions are VOC limited (Sharma et al., 2016) , thus this increase in O 3 could be due to more decrease in NOx compared to VOC. Furthermore, this could also be attributed to decrease in PM concentrations, which can result in more sunlight passing through atmosphere encouraging more photochemical activities and thus higher O 3 production (Dang and Liao, 2019; K. Li et al., 2019) . ",

About 44, 33, 29, 15 and 32% reductions in AQI were observed in north, south, east, central and western regions. Delhi observed the maximum reduction of 49% in AQI. This reduction in AQI was also associated with a change in dominant pollutant in many cities.

Similar lockdown in China did not result in significant improvement in air quality due to unfavourable meteorology (Wang et al., 2020) . To understand this effect, two simulations were carried out. While in Simulation 1 the actual meteorology during the analysis period in 2020 was used, in Simulation 2 the meteorology pertaining to worst case during early November of 2019 was used (Beig et al., 2020) . In both cases the emissions from all sources but energy, residential and windblown dust in Delhi NCR was zeroed out to predict PM 2.5 . The model performance in 30 observations stations in the city are shown in Table 1 . Results indicate that except in eight sites, the mean fractional bias (MFB) falls under the USEPA criteria of \u00b10.6 (EPA, 2007). The relative change in concentration in Simulation 2 compared to Simulation 1 is also included in Table 1 . In 24 sites an increase in concentration was observed due to unfavourable meteorology. On an average the concentration in Simulation 2 in sites with good model performance increased by 33% compared to Simulation 1. This indicates that even the meteorology was not favourable, the average daily PM 2.5 concentration in Delhi-NCR would increase to 54 \u03bcgm \u22123 , which is less than the CPCB standard (60 \u03bcgm \u22123 ) and 1.13 times more than the corresponding WHO standard. However, this increase might not be accurate in the air pollution episode during November, even though similar restrictions on human activities are implemented, as the residential emissions increase in north India mainly due to space heating (Guo et al., 2017) .",

Among all pollutants, PM 2.5 had maximum reduction in most regions. In contrary, in most regions an increase in O 3 was observed, which could be due to the decrease in PM in addition to decrease in NOx. This substantial reduction in concentrations resulted in a 4 times reduction in ER. As expected, a significant reduction in AQI was observed in 2020 compared to previous years. However, four cities had O 3 as their dominant pollutant instead of PM 2.5 , suggesting that attention should also be given to decreasing emissions of precursors to secondary pollutants in addition to controlling primary PM. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years. Further analysis on actual and unfavourable meteorology using WRF-AERMOD modelling system concluded that even the predicted PM 2.5 could increase due to unfavourable meteorology, the average concentration would still be under CPCB limits. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that a significant improvement in air quality in India could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented.
