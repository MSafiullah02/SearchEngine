            "text": "Clearly, the manufacturing sector provides critical products (e.g., autos, computers, aircrafts, telecommunications equipment, etc.) that enable What constitutes the services sector? It can be considered \"to include all economic activities whose output is not a physical product or construction, is generally consumed at the time it is produced and provides added value in forms (such as convenience, amusement, timeliness, comfort or health) that are essentially intangible\u2026\" (Quinn et al., 1987) . Implicit in this definition is the recognition that services production and services delivery are so integrated that they can be considered to be a single, combined stage in the services value chain, whereas the goods sector has a value chain that includes supplier, manufacturer, assembler, retailer, and customer. More importantly, services are co-produced, whereas goods have traditionally been pre-produced; this and other differences are explored in Section 5 to identify possible new innovations in services. Tien and Berg (2003) provide a comparison between the goods and services sectors. The goods sector requires material as input, is physical in nature, involves the customer at the design stage, and employs mostly quantitative measures to assess its performance. On the other hand, the services sector requires information as input, is virtual in nature, involves the customer at the production/delivery stage, and employs mostly qualitative measures to assess its performance. As a consequence, the management of goods technology is different than the management of services technology (Berg and Einspruch, 2007) . For example, since services are to a large extent subject to customer satisfaction and since, as Tien and Cahn (1981) postulated and validated, \"satisfaction is a function of expectation,\" service performance or satisfaction can be enhanced through the effective \"management\" of expectation. Parasuraman et al. (1998) employed the gap between expectation and actual service to evaluate service quality, as defined by reliability, tangibles, assurance, responsiveness and empathy. Tien and Berg (2003) also call for viewing services as systems that require integration with other systems and processes, over both time and space; in fact, they make a case for further developing a branch of systems engineering that focuses on problems and issues which arise in the services sector. In this manner, they demonstrate how the traditional systems approach to analysis, control and optimization can be applied to a system of systems that are each within the province of a distinct service provider. They underscore this special focus not only by the size and importance of the services sector but also by the unique opportunities that systems engineering can exploit in the design and joint production and delivery of services. In particular, they identify a number of service systems engineering methods to enhance the design and production/delivery of services, especially taking advantage of the unique features that characterize services -namely, services, especially emerging e(lectronic)services, are decision-driven, information-based, real-time, continuously-adaptive, customercentric and computationally-intensive.",

They consider the existent industry strategy to be in the red ocean (red, because of the bloody competition over a shrinking profit pool), while the innovative strategy to be in the blue ocean (blue, because of an uncontested market space that is ripe for growth). As an illustration, we employ the strategy canvas in Figure 1 to indicate howfrom our experience -BMW is differentiated from the other, high performance foreign vehicles (i.e., Acura, Audi, Infiniti and Lexus).",

It identifies the relationships between goods, experiences (which are typically integrated goods and services), and Table   9 identifies the primary drivers, enablers and decision attributes associated with 45 services innovation areas, assuming 5 areas in each of the 9 service categories or domains. Although both the domain areas and the identification process are quite subjective, it is interesting to note that the drivers, in order of impact, are: integration (16 out of 45), adaptation (13), customization (12) , and collaboration (4) . Similarly, the enablers are: automation (19) , organization (7), Third, as real-time decisions must be made in an accelerated and co-produced manner, the human decision maker or service provider will increasingly become a bottleneck; he/she must make way for a smart robot or software agent.

On the other hand, the differencesincluding competitive advantages due to innovations -among nations are being, in the words of Friedman (2005), \"flattened\". Consequently, anyone can innovate without having to emigrate to the U. S. or other developed countries. He astutely recognizes 10 events or forces that all came together in the 1990s and converged around the year 2000. They include: 1) 11/9/89, the day the Berlin Wall came down and the world became one; 2) 8/9/95, the day Netscape went public and ushered in the global potential of the Internet with a concomitant over-investment (and subsequent dot-com bubble and crash) in optic fibers, an investment which greatly benefited India's weak infrastructure; 3) out-sourcing, whereby support work -especially software-writing -can be digitized, disaggregated and shifted to any place in the world (e.g., India) where it could be done cheaper, better and faster; 4) off-shoring, whereby entire factories are shipped overseas (e.g., to China) because of cost considerations; 5) open-sourcing, whereby software source codes are shared and improved by interested users; 6) in-sourcing, whereby one company allows another company (e.g., United Parcel Service) to take over, for example, its logistics operation; 7) supply-chaining, whereby an efficient global supply chain links, for example, Wal-Mart to all its suppliers in real-time; 8) informing, whereby anyone can access data and information through the various search engines; 9) wireless access, whereby anyone can be reached at anytime and from anyplace; and 10) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), whereby telephony is carried out over the Internet. It should be noted that flatteners 3 through 8 are actually different forms of collaboration. In order to counter the adverse impacts of a flat world on the U. S., he recommends that three U.S. versus China/India gaps have to be addressed: an ambition gap among our workers, a production gap of graduating engineers and scientists, and an education gap in our K-12 grades. Another interesting consequence of the flat world is the emergence of a \"stateless\", 24/7 (i.e., always-on) transnational enterprise. For example, Trend Micro, an antivirus software company with executives and laboratories spread out in seven locations throughout the world from Munich to Tokyo, has been able to react and respond to viruses faster than Symantec, the market leader. With dual headquarters in Switzerland and Silicon Valley and its manufacturing center in low-cost Taiwan and China, Logitech is able to compete effectively with Microsoft in the area of computer peripherals.

Tien et al. (2004) for \"one-stop shopping\", a highly desirable situation for a consumer or customer. Integration of financial services has resulted in giant banks (e.g., Citigroup); integration of home building goods and services has resulted in super stores (e.g., Home Depot); and integration of software services has resulted in complex software packages (e.g., Microsoft Office). Integration also enhances system efficiency, if not its effectiveness. For example, the radio frequency identification (RFID) tagor computer chip with a transmitter -serves to integrate the supply chain. The tags are being placed on pallets or individual items passing through the supply chain. When activated by a reader, the tags can send or receive information. Wal-Mart and the U. S. Department of Defense are beginning to mandate the use of RFID in the supply chain. The real question is how companies can go beyond compliance and derive real value from RFID. Suppliers implementing RFID face two sets of considerations: \"before the beep\" and \"after the beep\", where the \"beep\" refers to the point at which an RFID tag is read by an electronic reader. Before the beep includes technical considerations to ensure that tags are properly encoded, affixed to pallets or cartoons, and positioned so that readers can obtain and interpret the data, while knowledge gleaned after the beep includes issues related to data management and abstracted information that could appropriately support or inform critical decision making. Early indications suggest that RFID can result in labor savings (as readers can replace employees by obtaining data from tags within 30 feet), revenue enhancement (as better inventory management can reduce inventory shrinkage), and more informed choices (as, for example, the elimination of unnecessary handling by automatically forwarding a product to the customer without having to go through a warehousing phase). Another benefit of employing RFID is speed; thus, whereas conveyor belts in a typical distribution center operate at about 20 to 30 feet per minute, the Wal-Mart mandate of 600 feet per minute is well within RFID's capabilities. Additionally, RFID can help suppliers take full responsibility for ensuring that the retailer's inventory is replenished on an as-needed basis, thereby eliminating lost sales due to out-of-stock merchandise. In essence, RFID serves to make the supply chains more visible in real-time, and as the price of tags decreases, RFID will become ever more popular and critical to the efficient functioning of any supply chain, including the distribution and shipping of goods. adaptive decision making is critical when confronting urban disruptions. While terrorist acts are the most insidious and onerous of all urban disruptions, it is obvious that there are many similarities in the way one should deal with these willful acts and those caused by natural and accidental incidents that have also resulted in adverse and severe consequences. However, there is one major and critical difference between terrorist acts and the other types of disruptions: the terrorist acts arewillful -and therefore also adaptive. One must counter these acts with the same, if not more sophisticated, willful, adaptive and informed approach. The right decisions must be made at the right time and for the right reason, including those concerned with the preparation for a major disruption, the prediction of such a disruption, the prevention or mitigation of the disruption, the detection of the disruption, the response to the disruption, and the recovery steps that are necessary to adequately, if not fully, recuperate from the disruption.",

Clearly, methods must be developed that can fuse and analyze a steady stream of non-homogeneous (i.e., quantitative and qualitative) data.It is helpful to further address data fusion, which can take place at the signal level, the feature level and/or the decision level.Signal-level fusion refers to combining the signals of a group of sensors. The signals from the sensors can be modeled as random variables, contaminated by uncorrelated noise. The fusion process is considered an estimation procedure. Only if the sensory signals are strictly homogeneous or alike can the fusion take place at the signal level. Feature-level fusion refers to combining the features that are extracted from sensory data. A set or vector of primary features is first obtained, then composite features can be created, and analysis is typically undertaken on the composite features. Thus, Ayache and Faugeras (1989) employ extended Kalman filtering to efficiently integrate sequences of images at the feature-level in order to determine the surfaces of three-dimensional objects. The feature-level fusion enables the overall uncertainty concerning the location of objects to be reduced in the presence of environmental and sensory noise. Gunatilaka and Baertlein (other hand, decision-level fusion refers to combining information extracted from sensory data at the highest level of abstraction; it is commonly employed in applications where multiple sensors are of a different nature or are located in different regions of the environment. Fusion is accomplished by judicious processing of the individual sensory information, or through symbolic reasoning that may make use of prior knowledge from a world model or sources external to the system. The prevailing techniques for decision-or symbol-level fusion include Bayesian (i.e., maximum a posteriori) estimation (Gunatilaka and Baertlein, 2001) and Dempster-Shafer's evidential reasoning (Garvey et al., 1981). Evidential reasoning is actually an extension of the Bayesian approach; it makes explicit any lack of information concerning a proposition's uncertainty by separating firm belief for the proposition from just its plausibility. In the Bayesian approach, all propositions (e.g., objects in the environment) for which there are no information are assigned an equal a priori probability. When additional information from a sensor becomes available and the number of unknown propositions is large relative to the number of known propositions, an intuitively unsatisfying result of the Bayesian approach is that the probabilities of known propositions become unstable. In the Dempster-Shafer approach, this is avoided by not assuming an a priori probability. Instead, the unknown propositions are assigned to \"ignorance\", which is reduced only when supporting information becomes available.",

Thus, adaptive (i.e., non steady-state) decision methods are required.

Nevertheless, the question remains: where are Tien's (2006) white spaces or Kim and Mauborgne's (2005) blue oceans where possible new innovations in services (and/or experiences) may reside?

At present, for example, Google provides a weighted or prioritized set of output pages when a word or phrase search is initiated; unfortunately, several hundreds of pages are presented and sometimes with conflicting, if not confusing, informationa classic case of the aforementioned data rich, information poor (DRIP) conundrum. Likewise, Wikipedia -with an anyone-can-contribute ethos and a 200 gigabyte database, containing 3 million articles in 200 languages -suffers from the same problem, even though some contributions can be edited by a Wikipedia elite of some 800 longtime contributors. Interestingly, in a recent comparison between Wikipedia and its major peer, Encyclopedia Britannica, Nature (2005) asked experts from several disciplines to review 50 articles -with identical subject matter and of similar length -from each encyclopedia and assess them for their accuracy, resulting in 2.9 errors per article for Encyclopedia Britannica versus 3.9 errors per article for Wikipedia. Nevertheless, it is obvious that an authoritative Google (Agoogle) is needed, one which provides fewer pages of output and a higher degree of accuracy for each search. Such an Agoogle would not only replace the various search engines but may well become the largest capitalized company in the world. A final white space concerns the economic measurement of services itself. Corrado et al. (2005) are concerned that while the government's decades-old system of data collection and statistical analysis are appropriate for capturing tangible investments in equipment, buildings and even software, they are inadequate in reflecting the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation. In other words, the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Washington, D. C., is not tracking the billions of dollars that companies spend each year on innovation and product design, brand-building, employee training, or any of the other investments -not consumptions -that are required to compete in today's global economy. As a result, services-oriented economies -like those of the U. S. and Japanare probably much stronger than the official statistics indicate.

To this, it might add information gathered by watching the user via a video camera or by scrutinizing his/her calendar. Most probably, such an agent would be based on a Bayesian statistical model -capable of evaluating hundreds of user-related factors linked by probabilities, causes and effects in a vast web of contingent outcomes -that infers the likelihood that a given decision on the software's part would lead to the user's desired outcome. The ultimate goal is to judge when the user can safely be interrupted, with what kind of message, and via which device.

Clearly, such agents constitute potential white spaces. Finally, the strategic, tactical and operational framework detailed herein is but just one Carnegie-Mellon University.

            "text": ", customers would like to be empowered as individuals; that is, as individuals, they should be able to a) contribute in a collaborative situation, b) receive customized or personalized attention, c) access an integrated system or process, and d) obtain adaptive real-time or just-in-time input. Thus, service innovations should be about how best to a) collaborate (especially in regard to self-serving, contributing, customization, integration and adaptation.Collaboration -especially inter-company collaboration -is perhaps the most surprising driver. After all, patents were established to protect intellectual property, long enough for the inventors to recoup a good return on their creative investment. However, since services are, by necessity, co-created or co-produced, collaboration is essential. Indeed, von Hippel(2005) found that 40 percent of a company's customers modify its products in some way so as to better suit their needs. Moreover, as noted by Palmisano (2004), the innovation challenges are too complex; they require collaboration across disciplines, specialties, organizations and cultures. Additionally, the easy access to data through search engines (e.g., Google, AOL, Yahoo, Microsoft Network, etc.), the proliferation of collaborative software (e.g., Wikipedia, MySpace), and the open source software movement (e.g., Linux, Open Invention Network) have all combined to facilitate collaboration. (In 2005, IBM gave -royalty free -500 software patents to the Open Invention recently initiated the Partnerships for Innovation program that seeks to bring together researchers from academe, the private sector, and government for the purpose of exploring new innovation partnerships. Amazon has taken a giant step in collaboration; through the Amazon Web Services effort, it has, in essence, given its software (including personalization functions) and a good portion of its actual sales to thousands of software developers, who are finding -for a fee -innovative ways of collaborating not because they wish to give away their business, but because they wish to grow the business. On the other hand, a large number of individuals are collaborating -for free -to enhance an open source software (e.g., Apache), to network, including meeting new friends, sharing photos, or emailing internally (e.g., MySpace), to play a global game with guilds and imaginary gold (e.g., World of Warcraft), or even to live in a virtual world with individualized avatars and Linden dollars (e.g., Second Life), all to satisfy their creative, if not altruistic, and competitive needs. There is much to learn about collaboration, organization, and other real-time business applications from the always-on virtual world. In fact, the real-world is using Second Life type of environments to introduce and test new ads, to train new hires, and to design and market new products. Of course, the two worlds are becoming more intertwined when virtual land development companies act in a very realistic manner and when 300 Linden dollars can be exchanged for one U. S. dollar. Customization is a critical by-product of collaboration. Tien et al. (2004) have identified several levels of customization. Partial customization occurs in an assemble-to-order environment; that is, upon the arrival of a customer order, the stocked components are assembled into a finished product. As examples, in addition to computer assemblers like Dell and Gateway, Nike offers a program called NikeiD that allows customers to choose the color, material, cushioning, and other attributes of their athletic shoe order, and Procter & Gamble allows women to create and order custom personal-care products such as cosmetics, fragrances, and shampoos. Another form of partial customization occurs when the customer market is partitioned into an appropriate number of segments, each with similar needs. For example, Amazon targets their marketing of a new book to an entire market segment if several members of the segment act to acquire the book, although its approach is neither massive nor timely at this time. Mass customization occurs when the customer market is partitioned into a very large number of segments, with each Customization of clothing, car seats, and other body-fitted products is being advanced through laser-based, 3-D body scanners that not only capture a \"point cloud\" of the targeted body surface (e.g., some 150,000 points are required to create a digital skin of the entire body) but also the software algorithms that integrate the points and extract the needed size measurements. For example, European shoe makers recently initiated a project called EUROShoE, in which an individual's feet are laser scanned and the data are forwarded to a CAD/CAM computer that controls the manufacturing process. Likewise, electronics giant Toshiba wants to give Web surfers and walk-in customers new tools to view digital versions of themselves trying on clothes, accessories and make-up.",

Paradoxically, one set of white spaces concern innovations that can mitigate the unforeseen consequences or abuses of earlier innovations. Antivirus companies like Symantec and Trend Micro are barely able to cope with the avalanche of new viruses and virus delivery schemes. Ad spamming is taking over the email system, much like junk mail took over the traditional postal system. Spyware, a form of adware that tracks an individual's every click and sends the data to advertisers, has now infected some 80 percent of all personal computers in the U. S. Indeed, fraudulent clicks by robotic viruses have cost advertisers millions of dollars. In \"phishing\" or creating a replica of an existing Web page to fool users into submitting personal, financial or password data, hackers are stealing individual identities and committing fraud. Sadly, the same innovations that have enhanced global interconnectedness have engendered new vulnerabilities, including cyber attacks. Thus, electronic viruses, biological agents and other toxic materials can turn a nation's \"lifelines\" into \"deathlines\", in that they can be used to facilitate the spread of these materials -whether by accident or by willful act. In this vein, the Internet -with over a billion users -has become a terrorist tool; jihad websites are recruiting members, soliciting funds, and promoting violence (e.g., by showing the beheading of hostages). Also, as evidenced by the 9/11 attack, components of an infrastructure (e.g., airplanes) can be used as weapons of destruction. In sum, new and more powerful innovations are required to secure and safeguard those innovations -including mobile devices, electronic systems, and, more recently, even RFID tags -that define and underpin our advanced economies. A related set of white spaces concern innovations that can safeguard our rights to privacy. In fact, in 2003 the U. S. Congress stopped the Terrorism Information Awareness program sponsored by the Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) because it was going to mine massive amounts of data, including personal transactions of U. S. citizens, in order to connect the dots leading to terrorists and terrorism. Moreover, the continuing anti-terrorist surveillance program by the U. S. government and the widely acclaimed and increasingly profitable search, marketing and even social networking innovations on the Internet could easily be considered to be an invasion of privacy. As an example, constitutional scholars feel that current wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) on communications between individuals outside the U. S. and citizens inside the country is both unconstitutional and against the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Additionally, identifying one's buying habits, broadcasting one's location and submitting data to social network sites about one's friends (without their explicit permission) are also questionable from a privacy perspective. Clearly, sophisticated innovations are required to prevent incursions into our private lives.Another set of white spaces concern innovations that can protect us from the always-on, interconnected world. With a 24/7 electronic world and wireless mobile devices, we are unfortunately always reachable -for mostly business purposes -from anywhere in the world. Increasingly, our business life extends into and takes over or displaces our home life.Thus, although our work output has increased (mostly due to our increased working hours), we more electronic devices and gadgets do not necessarily increase our well-being; instead, over time, we tend to take these innovations for granted and to raise our expectations for what future innovations can bring, thus mitigating our overall satisfaction -which, as Tien and Cahn",

            "text": "A number of remarks should be made concerning the process or calculus of services innovation that is contained herein. First, it is obvious that such a process or calculus must constantly be refined as new business practices,new technologies, new customer needs and new cultural imperatives surface. Moreover, as Christensen et al. (2007) suggest, sometimes customer needs -which may be quite different at different times -should not be the focus of an innovation; instead, the job -which exists independently from the customer and is relatively stable over time -should be the focus. Second, as emphasized throughout the paper, significant research is required to fully and fruitfully apply the proposed calculus to identifying new innovations in services. For example, the decision informatics paradigm must continuously undergo upgrades and refinements, especially as computing becomes faster and cheaper and as powerful new tools are developed. Additionally, research into cognition (i.e., understanding how people process input) could result in findings that may have a significant impact on not only services innovation, but also the decision making process itself. It should be noted, however, that although so called, \"business intelligence\" (BI) software (offered by MicroStrategy, Hyperion Solutions, SAS, Cognos, etc.) could have been developed by employing the decision informatics paradigm, we are not aware that any of the proprietary software actually followed such a purposeful, systematic and decision-driven approach.Moreover, to our knowledge, most of the BI software attempts to make sense of the transactions data and to present it in a way that anyone, from a sales representative to a chief executive, can understand and use; indeed, for the most part, the software represents a query window into data warehouses. Thus, it is unclear whether the BI software contains any sophisticated, real-time data fusion, data analysis, decision modeling, or systems engineering methods.",
