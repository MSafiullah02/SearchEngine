However, for some viruses, particular strains are endemic to specific areas and can be genetically distinguished from strains in other regions. In contrast, for some other viruses, genetically similar strains can spread and circulate all over the world. This study addresses global dissemination of various viral infections. Methods: We classified 34 viruses as per their ability to cross borders by review. We also described factors responsible for and the dynamics of global dissemination. We examined biological characteristics of viruses, manners or routes of transmission, host responses and epidemiological factors. Results: Factors required for viruses to cross borders include 'non-blood infection', 'short incubation period', 'short infectious period', 'frequent re-infection', 'small basic reproductive number (R 0 )' and 'high annual incidence'. Conclusion: Knowing the factors responsible for global dissemination of pathogens is useful for controlling and/or containing both classic and emerging infectious diseases.",

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was first observed in the human population between the 19th and 20th centuries [1, 2] . Then, the virus spread all over the world within decades [3] . In 2002-2003, a new variant of coronavirus from southern China, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, spread throughout many countries across continents within a few months [4] . Pandemic influenza remains a great global concern. In 2009, swine-origin H1N1 virus caused a pandemic [5] . This virus from North America spread all over the world and caused substantial morbidity and mortality [5] . Knowing the factors responsible for global dissemination of pathogens is useful for controlling and/or containing both classic and emerging infectious diseases. Moreover, many vaccine-unpreventable viral infections can turn to be vaccine-preventable diseases in near future [6] . Knowledge of global dynamics and distribution of pathogens can guide us in establishing vaccination strategies.",

Today, people can travel freely to different parts of the world in no time because of globalization and advancements in aviation technology. This, however, fails to explain the spread of diseases such as the Spanish flu in the early 20th century that led to a pandemic, even with slower modes of transportation [7] . Localization of a virus can be attributed to its distribution by non-human reservoirs. A good example is a tropical disease like yellow fever that is transmitted by mosquitoes. The disease is endemic only in areas where there are mosquitoes transmitting the yellow fever virus.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) develops new variants almost annually and these new variants are present simultaneously in widely separated areas [10] [11] [12] [13] .

With regard to measles virus, which we regarded as LOCAL, the multiple genotypes in Morocco, the US, Canada and the UK were attributed to multiple importations, suggesting frequent importation and lack of endemic strains [16] . In several European countries, some previously endemic genotypes appear to have been replaced by imported strains [16] . With regard to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), certain HIV-1 genotypes are geographically clustered, inferring that they are LOCAL, although demographic clustering is not absolute [3, 25, 26] . Certain recombinant viruses have already contributed substan-tially to the global pandemic [3, 25] . It has been suggested that HIV-1 subtypes can influence viral transmissibility and pathogenicity [27, 28] . This implies that only specific 'strong' (in replication ability and/or transmission ability) strains could be GLOBAL. We could not define obvious borderline between LOCAL and GLOBAL such as P-distance because each study had used different ways. Although the classification into the two categories is not robust, we classified viruses, if anything, into LOCAL or GLOBAL. * After review, it was hard to classify as LOCAL or GLOBAL. As to coronavirus, 229E isolated at geographically distinct locations showed little evidence of variability, whereas isolates of OC43 from distant areas differed in sequence. As to rhinovirus, few studies were conducted investigating intra-subtypic diversity since the virus has more than 100 serotypes. ",

An explanation could be that small R 0 favors frequent re-infection since infection by a virus for which R 0 is high confers life-long immunity, as is the case with infections caused by measles virus, rubella virus and poliovirus. Re-infection with such viruses is rare. If we look at this from a LOCAL virus perspective, herd immunity could provide an explanation. Most people in a community are infected with indigenous strains of a virus with high R 0 resulting in herd immunity, thus protecting them from re-infection with imported strains.

Therefore, a short generation time cannot sufficiently explain differences between LOCAL and GLOBAL viruses, which might be confounded by other factors.

An epicenter is characterized by high incidence and continuous transmission of the infec- tion. In fact, our analysis found 'high annual incidence' as a factor associated with GLOBAL viruses. Population density can also affect spread of infectious diseases. Especially, the spread of measles has been studied focusing on the synchrony between endemicity and spatiotemporal factors. Sparsely populated regions appear to act as barriers to local diffusion of measles and may act to channel and isolate epidemics in urban centers [37] . Breaks in the continuity of measles transmission were found for communities with small population (e.g. rural areas and small islands) [38] [39] [40] [41] . Thus, waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to peripheral small towns at the domestic level [39, 42] . There is also a tendency for the influenza season to start in California more often than in any other state [43] . This can be attributed to population size and international connectivity.",

In such communities, it would be interesting to note what type of viruses can be imported there with little communication with the outside world.",
