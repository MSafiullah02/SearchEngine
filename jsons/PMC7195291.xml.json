Small droplets are released in the environment every time someone sneezes, coughs, or talks. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Given their travel history, the current epidemiological emergency, and the fact that conjunctivitis has been described as a presenting sign of infection with Coronaviridae family of viruses, it was decided to perform a naso-pharyngeal swab in all these five subjects. It is important to note however that no one of them displayed fever, general malaise, or respiratory symptoms.",

Despite exceptional measures such as nation-wide lockdowns, containing the spread of SARS-CoV-19 has been difficult. It has been questioned whether and to which extent asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of the virus. The percentage of asymptomatic cases is also still debated, but according to a recent Japanese analysis, about 30 % (95 % confidence interval between 7.7 % and 53.8 %) of infected subjects might remain completely asymptomatic [11]. Patient zero of the Italian outbreak is believed to become infected via an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individual [12].",
