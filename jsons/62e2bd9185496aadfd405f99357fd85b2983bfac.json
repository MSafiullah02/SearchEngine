He was evaluated by gastroenterology and otolaryngology and an endoscopy and laryngoscopy were performed. There were no obvious signs of bleeding but endoscopy did note blood emanating from the larynx. At presentation, his physical exam was notable for bilateral inspiratory rales with normal vital signs including oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.",

The serologic analysis that confirmed the diagnosis included Antinuclear Antibody of 1:360, P-ANCA positivity, and antibody to Myeloperoxidase of greater than 8.0 units. The constellation of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, renal involvement, and p-ANCA/MPO positivity confirmed a diagnosis of Microscopic Polyangiitis. Imaging of the sinuses showed no signs of inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide pulse dosing for six doses.

Three characteristic patterns have been identified: Capillaritis, 'Bland' pulmonary hemorrhage, and alveolar bleeding due to another process [1, 2] . Capillaritis is the most common cause of DAH and is typically a result of antibody-mediated cell damage. Autoimmune conditions associated with DAH include antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides, Goodpasture Syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Table 33 .1). Initial evaluation of a patient with hemoptysis and suspected diffuse alveolar hemorrhage typically includes fiberoptic bronchoscopy to identify a source of bleeding, identification of potential infectious etiologies, and serologic workup for autoimmune conditions. DAH should be distinguished from other causes of pulmonary hemorrhage caused by localized pulmonary abnormalities and the bronchial circulation. ",

            "text": "The diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitides is usually based upon findings of pulmonary and/or renal abnormalities with small-vessel necrotizing inflammation with the presence of auto-antibodies directed against neutrophilic anti-gens. Previously, ANCA directed antibodies were classified as cytoplasmic-pattern and perinuclear-patter, c-ANCA and p-ANCA, respectively. The two ANCA antigens commonly identified are proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). MPO is more commonly associated with microscopic polyangiitis with a sensitivity of 50-70%, although PR3 has been identified in cases of MPA with a sensitivity of 26% [5] [6] [7] . Specificity of the combination of P-ANCA and MPO for ANCA-associated vasculitides is significantly greater at 99.8% [8] . In a review of patients with MPA and alveolar hemorrhage, 14 out of 27 patients revealed p-ANCA positivity while 11 out of 27 patients were c-ANCA positive [4] . Among those with p-ANCA antibodies, 12 out of 12 patients were positive for MPO specific antibodies. The requirement of biopsy for the diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitides remains controversial. In the correct clinical setting with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, radiographic abnormalities, and serologic confirmation of antibody, the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis can be determined. Given the relapsing nature of disease and requirements for prolonged immunosuppression, it is suggested that confirmation of diagnosis by histopathology be determined whenever possible.",

Historically, initial management of ANCA-associated vasculitides has centered on immunosuppression with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. The goal of treatment is induction of remission and maintenance of disease suppression. Therapy is typically tailored to severity of disease, notably mild vs. moderate to severe. These determinations are based upon organ-threatening or lifethreatening manifestations. Pulmonary involvement, and specifically alveolar hemorrhage, is considered moderate to severe disease. Plasmapheresis has been shown to be beneficial in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and ANCAassociated vasculitis [9] . In many cases the pulmonary hemorrhage may be exacerbated by coagulopathy. Aggressive treatment with platelets for thrombocytopenia or fresh frozen plasma may be needed for control of the alveolar hemorrhage. There may be a component of pulmonary congestion due to left heart pathology. Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure can improve pulmonary congestion by decreasing afterload and preload thus helping with alveolar hemorrhage. Also, as a patient with DAH becomes hypoxemic, increasing peep may recruit more alveoli and improve oxygenation.",

Cyclophosphamide carries several adverse reactions including cytopenias, infertility, bladder injury, and risk of malignancy. It has been identified that B lymphocytes play an integral in role in the pathogenicity of auto-immunity [14] . Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been successfully used to reduce B-lymphocyte populations. Since 2010, there has been growing evidence that Rituximab can be used as an alternative to cyclophosphamide in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitides. When compared with cyclophosphamide, Rituximab was found to be non-inferior at induction of remission and maintenance of remission [15, 16] . In fact, Rituximab was found to be more effective for inducing remission of relapsing disease (67% vs. 42) [15] . Rituximab has been found to be superior to azathioprine in disease remission over 2 years [17] . Thus, rituximab has been shown to be a viable option for treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitides. While the patient in the case report was treated with cyclophosphamide, the use of rituximab could have been entertained.",

Systemic recombinant Factor VII has been successfully used in a case of massive hemoptysis due to community acquired pneumonia [18] . Case reports and observational studies have shown a beneficial effect of intrapulmonary administration of activated recombinant factor VII in cases of refractory diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [19] [20] [21] . Primarily, this practice has been shown to be beneficial in cases of DAH in allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplant recipients. Limited case reports, however, have reported successful cessation of bleeding in cases of ANCA-associated vasculitis [19, 21] . At this time, use of recombinant Factor VII is considered \"off-label\" but further study is warranted for general use in cases of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage refractory to standard therapy.",
