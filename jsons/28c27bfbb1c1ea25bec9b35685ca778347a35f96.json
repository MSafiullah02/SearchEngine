Respirology 2007; 12: 100-103 Background and objective: Health-care workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of acquisition and transmission of respiratory virus infections. Nosocomial transmission of influenza has been documented but whether this is so for other respiratory viruses has not been assessed. Methods: Epidemiological, clinical and viral laboratory surveillance was carried out on HCWs presenting with acute respiratory infection in a university hospital. Results: Over a 2-year period, 203 subjects were recruited: rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus (37.7% in flu negative samples) and influenza A/B was positive in only 12.3% of subjects. Only 19.7% of HCWs were immunized against influenza. High detection of rhinovirus occurred even during the peak of the influenza season and half of the infected subjects reported an influenzalike illness. Conclusion: Rhinovirus infection occurred frequently in this study population and probably contributes to influenza misdiagnosis. Educational interventions about different viruses causing respiratory symptoms and an increase in standards of infection control besides influenza immunization among HCWs is needed.",

Nosocomial spread of these agents follows a seasonal pattern, with the peak incidence in winter months, reflecting the disease activity in the community. 1 Influenza infection is of great concern given the significant morbidity and mortality that ensues. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of influenza infection due to their exposure to ill patients, as well as their exposure to the general community. 2 Vaccination of HCWs has been shown to reduce the incidence of influenza among them and results in prevention of disease transmission to patients. 3 However, vaccine access and misconceptions regarding the vaccine efficacy and possible side-effects are associated with non-vaccination in some studies. 4 Influenza immunization effectiveness is related to local influenza activity and laboratory documentation of other viral infections may be helpful to clarify concerns about exclusive influenza prophylaxis conferred by vaccine among HCWs. 2 Other viruses usually more related to common cold clinical presentation may account for some misconception. In this context, Boivin et al. 5 reported the role of picornaviruses in flu-like illnesses in adults. Epidemiology surveys in Brazil have highlighted the role of rhinovirus as a very frequent cause of respiratory disease. 6 In addition, rhinovirus infection appears to result in a higher morbidity and mortality than usually seen with the common cold. 7 To address this, a study of HCWs from a university hospital was undertaken to assess the aetiology of respiratory viral infections, their clinical presentation",

There was a very low rate of influenza immunization among HCWs from the Sao Paulo Hospital. Previous surveys on vaccination conducted in the USA and Europe have shown that influenza immunization rates among HCWs are usually less than 30%. 10, 11 There is considerable effort taken to improve influenza immunization rates among HCWs to improve patient safety particularly for those patients at high risk. 12 In this regard it is very important to understand the reasons for non-compliance to vaccination programmes. The reasons identified were fear of adverse side-effects from the vaccine, avoidance of medications and on individual belief of low susceptibility to influenza infection. 2 The major reason identified by another study of vaccination refusal in the Brazilian elderly was the misconception that the vaccine may cause influenza and the common concern about the 'non-effectiveness' to prevent 'flu and cold'. 13 Rhinovirus was the most frequent virus detected and did not follow a typical seasonal pattern as described elsewhere. The frequency of rhinovirus infection is probably underestimated because coinfection in these influenza positive samples was not assessed. In addition, ILI clinical presentation was associated with rhinovirus infection in half of the study population and is likely to contribute to the misconceptions about influenza vaccine effectiveness, particularly during the influenza season, with there being high circulation of both viruses. As ILI in this study was the reason for a physician consultation, the high rate of these symptoms among rhinovirus infected patients may be overestimated. The design of the study did not allow investigation of rhinovirus infection in patients with mild symptoms. However, Boivin and collaborators did assess the role of rhinoviruses as a frequent pathogen associated with important respiratory and systemic symptoms among health volunteers, during the influenza season. 5 Those results strongly suggested that rhinovirus contributed to the maintenance of the myth that inactivated influenza vaccine could cause the flu.",
