These RCs contain viral RNA and proteins as well as several recruited host proteins and lipids that create a favorable environment for RNA replication. RCs may serve as platforms to concentrate viral RNA, proteins, and nucleotides, creating an appropriate replicase topology. Additionally, RCs form a barrier between viral RNA replication and the cytosol, which contains innate immune sensors and RNA degradation machinery. In this paper, we review in mechanistic detail the formation of viral RCs and highlight recent findings that have advanced our understanding of (+) RNA virus replication.",

For some viruses, the source of membranes is unimportant. Flock house virus (FHV) replication is unperturbed by targeting RCs to a different subcellular location [2]. However, other (+) RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) have distinct but spatially linked sites of replication and virion assembly that likely require specific localization of RC formation [3, 4\u2022]. Multiple lines of evidence support a role for RCs as the site of viral replication, as opposed to a cellular response to viral infection. Immuno electron microscopy (EM) detects BrUTP incorporation into FHV viral RNA localized inside RCs [5], while long (>40 nucleotide) dsRNA, indicative of the RNA replication intermediate, is detected in RCs for several (+) RNA viruses [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\u2022].",

Prototype viruses of the DMV RC class include the coronaviruses, picornaviruses, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV DMVs are ER-derived vesicles that appear sealed from the cytoplasm [3]. Since there is not an obvious neck, as with the invagination RCs, it is unclear how HCV RNA could traffic from the RC to the site of virion assembly, the lipid droplet. It has been proposed that components of the nuclear pore complex are recruited to HCV RCs to regulate traffic into and out of the RC [25, 26\u2022]. HCV also induces single-membrane and multi-membrane vesicles that are not associated with replicating viral RNA, but may represent endosomes and/or autophagosomes, which are sometimes observed in the proximity of RCs [10, 27, 28, 29].",

Reticulons induce positive membrane curvature, which may promote two functions: (i) counter-balance the 1a negative membrane curvature to enable spherule expansion or (ii) promote positive membrane curvature at the neck of the spherule (Figure 1a).

Given these similarities, the role of the ESCRT machinery, which is required for retroviral budding, has been investigated in two plant viruses that form invaginations: tomato bushy shunt virus (TBSV) and BMV. TBSV p33 recruits cellular ESCRT-I proteins to induce formation of its RC [35, 36], while ESCRT-III proteins are required for proper RC morphology [36, 37]. This suggests a role for ESCRT-I in initiating invagination, with ESCRT-III required to produce the correct RC morphology, possibly closing the neck of the invagination via positive membrane curvature with incomplete membrane scission. Thus, there are similarities between TBSV RC formation and the steps of retroviral budding before membrane scission. BMV also co-opts ESCRT-III factors for proper BMV spherule formation [38\u2022]. Unlike TBSV and HIV, BMV does not require components of ESCRT-I. Presumably, its 1a protein can initiate RC invagination without the need for ESCRT-I.",

            "text": "A second strategy for modulating membrane curvature is to modify its lipid composition, either via lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) or de novo lipid synthesis. This can involve the insertion of lipids that (i) increase membrane fluidity (cholesterol, sphingomyelin, or unsaturated phospholipids), (ii) induce positive membrane curvature (ceramide), or (iii) induce negative membrane curvature (lysophosphatidylcholine). Modifying membrane lipid composition is likely crucial for RC formation, virion envelopment (and possibly assembly), and virion infectivity. A key node for viral manipulation of lipid synthesis is fatty acid synthase (FASN), which generates palmitate (C16:0). Palmitate is either post-translationally linked to proteins or further modified by lipid synthetic enzymes to produce the bulk of membrane lipids. Replication of multiple (+) RNA viruses requires FASN [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. HCV increases the expression of FASN, although FASN does not appear to localize to RCs [43]. FASN is redistributed to RCs during DENV [39, 45] and WNV infection [42]. DENV NS3 binds FASN, recruits it to RCs stimulates its activity and de novo lipid synthesis [39]. This is required for DENV replication and lipid alterations at the RC, including increases in sphingomyelin and ceramide upon DENV infection of mosquito cells [41].",

Although PC and PE are increased during HCV infection [47], only PC accumulates in HCV RCs [48\u2022]. In the case of BMV RC formation, the BMV 1a protein interacts with and recruits choline requiring 2 (Cho2p), a cellular enzyme involved in PC synthesis, to sites of viral replication, which is essential for BMV replication [48\u2022]. Alternatively, TBSV RC formation relies on PE. TBSV p33 promotes cellular redistribution of PE and in vitro reconstitution of TBSV RCs from liposomes revealed an exclusive role for PE in maintaining TBSV replication. [49\u2022]. Modulation of lipid synthesis is thus a general strategy for formation of both classes of RCs.",

PI(4)P recruits LTPs to RCs leading to alterations in the lipid composition of the RC. HCV NS5A binds and activates the ER resident kinase, PI4K-III\u03b1at RCs, which is essential for HCV replication and appropriate RC morphology [50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. Two LTPs that bind PI(4)P are implicated in HCV replication: four-phosphate adaptor protein 2 (FAPP2) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). FAPP2 is recruited to viral RCs where it might supply glycosphingolipids [55]. OSBP interacts with NS5A and its silencing leads to inhibition of both HCV replication and particle secretion [56, 57, 58]. OSBP is recruited to HCV replication compartments in a PI(4)P-dependent manner and mediates transport of cholesterol to RCs [56]. PI4K-III\u03b1 has two other functions in HCV replication. It modulates NS5A phosphorylation and the downstream product of PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2, also accumulates at RCs and is bound by NS5A, which may be important for appropriate replicase topology [59, 60].",

A second source of cholesterol for RCs, in addition to OSBP, is retrograde trafficking from the plasma membrane to RCs via early endosomes during enterovirus infection [64].
