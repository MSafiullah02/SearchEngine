From the perspective of the severity of a spreading process, the most influential spreaders are those resulting in a much larger final infected proportion of the whole system when the spread of a disease or a piece of information originates from them than from other nodes. Centrality measures such as the degree [1], betweenness [2], closeness [3], eigenvector centrality [4], and k-shell coreness [5] have been used to identify the most influential spreaders. The degree is the simplest measure. In social networks, for example, an individual with a large degree has more direct contact with other people and is thus likely to be more influential than one with a small degree for transmitting disease or information. Subsequent research indicates that the core nodes as identified by the k-shell decomposition are the most influential spreaders [6]. Algorithms based on other centrality measures have been proposed to improve the accuracy of identifying influential spreaders [7\u201310]. They include the neighborhood coreness [11], improved eigenvector centrality [12,13], H index [14,15], and nonbacktracking centrality [16].",

For example, by counting the number of possible infection paths of various lengths, the final infection range can be estimated for a spread originated from any node [17]. The degree distribution of clusters of infected nodes after certain transmission events leads to a node property called the expected force, which can be applied to predict the spreading influence of all nodes under different epidemiological models [18]. The dynamic-sensitive centrality is able to locate influential nodes from both topological features and the dynamical parameters, such as the infection and recovery rates in a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model [19]. In the k-truss decomposition, which is a triangle-based extension of k-shell decomposition, the maximal k-truss subgraph contains the most influential spreaders [20].",

            "text": "In most studies on identifying influential spreaders so far, the networks are taken to be unweighted and undirected. Each edge is treated as being equivalent in its function, as in the centrality and ranking methods [10]. However, edges in a network could be quite different [21]. In weighted networks, the weight of an edge reflects the strength of the interaction between the connected nodes, as in situations concerning the number of communications, size of trade, intimacy of friendship, frequency of cooperation, etc. [22\u201324]. In addition, edges may not be equally important in keeping the network robust [25]. An example is the small influence on network robustness in food web networks when redundant links are removed [26]. In terms of network functionality, differences among edges are also observed. For example, removing redundant links has no effect on network synchronization [27], but closing specific routes in air transportation networks can minimize the spreading of a disease [28]. To quantify the weight of an edge, a class of measures relying on its importance in the network structure has been defined [29]. For example, the edge betweenness counts the number of shortest paths between any two nodes that go through the edge and it can be regarded as the weight of an edge [30]. Immunizing edges of high betweenness was found to be effective in suppressing epidemics [31], but deleting such edges in scale-free networks would enhance the transmission efficiency dramatically [32]. In a global air transportation network, the strength of an edge that reflects the volume of passengers traveling between two airports was found to correlate positively with the product of the degree of the connected nodes. Thus, a measure wij=(kikj)\u03b8\n[33] was introduced as the weight of an edge. This measure has been adopted in many works for distinguishing the importance among edges in unweighted networks [34\u201336].",

The sum of asymmetric weights of links originated from a node defines a measure of the strength si of a node i, which is shown to be an efficient quantity for identifying influential spreaders with a low computational complexity. Based on the node strength, an s-shell decomposition scheme is proposed for assigning an s-shell index to every node, which provides a more accurate ranking of the nodes in their influence in spreading processes.",

The k-shell decomposition method decomposes the network into hierarchical shells in a progressive process. Initially, nodes with degree k=1 are removed from the network together with their links. After the process, nodes with only one link left may appear. These nodes and their links are then removed and the process is repeated until there are no nodes left in the network with only one link. The removed nodes and links form the 1-shell, and these nodes are assigned an index kS=1. Next, nodes with degree k\u22642 are removed in a similar way and the set of removed nodes are assigned an index kS=2. This pruning process is continued until all nodes are removed and assigned a kS index. This index is called the k-shell index or coreness of a node.

To quantify the influence of each node on spreading, we let one node, say, node i, be infected and all the other nodes be susceptible initially. The SIR dynamics proceeds from the seed-infected node to other nodes until there is no infected node in the network. The recovered nodes at the end are those once infected and the fraction of recovered nodes gives the final infected range of the initial seed. For an initially infected node i, the spreading dynamics is repeated for 100 times. The average infected range Mi of node i is recorded and taken to reflect the influence or the spreading efficiency of the node i. This quantity can be obtained for any node i in the network and used as a measure to rank the nodes on their importance in the spreading dynamics.

On the other hand, too large an infection probability gives spreading efficiencies of the nodes that are too close to each other to clearly distinguish their relative importance. In the results that follow, we choose an infection probability \u03bb that is above the epidemic threshold and makes the final infected range amount to 1%\u201320% of the system for most nodes as the spreading origins [6].",

The idea can be illustrated by considering a leaf node (node of degree 1) connected to a hub (a node of large degree), the number of outgoing links is very large for this leaf node.

This method defines the weight symmetrically in both directions and focuses on the influence of clustering, i.e., counting the number of nodes that are both first and second neighbors. This idea is partly in contrast to our method of weakening the effect of nodes that are both first and second neighbors.

The results show that the node strength outperforms the degree (squares) in almost all networks.

The edges connecting i and its neighbors will be assigned a large link weight, thus resulting in a large strength, as well as a large s-shell index. If evaluated by degree and the k-shell index, node i will be ranked low as a less important node. Second, the methods proposed herein can identify nodes that are in fact not influential spreaders but are ranked high by degree and k-shell index, which form a local clique structure [39]. For example, in the real-world network CA-Hep, there exists a cliquelike local structure composed of 32 mutually connected nodes with very few outgoing links. In our methods, the edges of these nodes will be assigned low weights, due to the very few or even no outgoing links, thus having a low strength and s-shell index.

In Ref. [53] the authors indicated that clustering strongly affects the percolation properties and size of a giant component. By avoiding the edges that are responsible for clustering, the percolation properties of clustered random networks can be computed correctly. This idea is very similar to our way of defining the dynamical importance of edges, which synthesizes the first and second neighbors but neglects the nodes that are both first and second neighbors. This guarantees that the contribution of triangles is not overcounted. How to use the percolation theory to distinguish the influence of each node requires further exploration [54,55]. For example, researchers used the optimal percolation and message-passing method to predict the spreading influence of nodes and the proposed index counts the degree of nodes that is at a certain distance from the central node [51].",

Let us set a=1/2 so that the term (kikjout)a in wij represents a geometric mean. The comparison in Fig. 6 of the imprecision function shows that si ranking gives a lower imprecision than the degree and k-shell index. An interesting point is that the imprecision of node strength evaluated at a=1/2 is even lower than that evaluated at the optimal value of a in the AS network for p<0.1. The result indicates that although the best performing overall ranking correlation coefficient occurs at some optimal a, the same value does not necessarily give the best identification of the most influential spreaders.\n",

Although an edge between nodes i and j certainly helps spread a disease, its role may be different when the infection goes from i to j than in the other direction. This is because what matters is whether the node j, after infected by i, would reach out to other nodes that node i itself could not reach. If so, the link carries a greater importance for infection from i to j, which is quantified by a higher weight wij for the link. It is therefore necessary to invoke asymmetric and bidirectional weights with wij\u2260wji for a link so as to capture the dynamics in spreading processes. Here we introduced a form of wij [see Eq. (3)] and showed that it facilitates accurate ranking in the node's importance. Pictorially, the network is better described by the nodes connected by links with asymmetric weights in different directions when spreading dynamics is concerned.",

Applying s and ss rankings to nine real-world networks, it was found that our measures generally outperform the standard rankings based on the degree of the nodes and the k-shell decomposition method.

In all cases, the measure with asymmetric weights ss works better than that without the asymmetry. In the Emailcontact and Hamster networks, the two measures are equally accurate.

The idea of examining the functionality of a link in spreading in either direction is a general one and thus could be further developed for ranking a set of objects. As the current method only considers one step, it may be extended to further steps. Consider if node j in Fig. 1 has three outgoing nodes that are leaf nodes, while node k has only one outgoing node which further connects to many nodes. Whether taking further steps into consideration is a better choice for defining the dynamical link weights needs to be verified in future research. Previous results indicated that taking the two-step neighborhood into consideration balanced the calculation cost and ranking accuracy the best in a ranking method [56]. Although we work on defining the link weight from the network structure, it is worth considering how to integrate the artificial link weight with real weight on weighted networks. We think that the formation of a network structure depends on the function of the network elements of nodes and links. Thus, the artificial link weight defined by the structure and the real weight on weighted networks that reflects the function may be highly correlated. How to merge and balance these two features in weighted networks is a valuable question to be explored in future work. In addition, we used the SIR model as the spreading dynamics. However, the idea of invoking asymmetric weights wij\u2260wji for a link remains valid for other processes such as rumor spreading and information diffusion, although the exact form of the weights may depend on the details of the process under consideration.",
