Although lipids such as fatty acids, phospholipids and sterols are obtained from their host or are synthesized from building blocks obtained from the host, less abundant lipids that are more difficult to acquire (e.g. specific unsaturated fatty acids, eicosanoids, ecdysteroids and quinones) are synthesized by the parasite, often by modification of more abundant substrates 102, 103, 104. Comparison of the four different panels shows that viruses, bacteria and parasites target glycolipids whereas fungi do not. Many viruses and bacteria use glyco(sphingo)lipids as receptors, but whether these lipids are indeed crucial for infection has been addressed in only a few cases.

Most DNA viruses (e.g. herpes viruses) replicate their genomes inside the nucleus, but some [e.g. vaccinia virus (VACV)] assemble structures in the cytoplasm to complete their replication cycles (reviewed in 108\n109). All +RNA viruses [e.g. poliovirus (PV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), West\u2010Nile virus (WNV) and SARS\u2010 and MERS\u2010coronavirus] reorganize host cell membranes into membranous structures in the cytoplasm that serve as a scaffold for viral RNA synthesis/replication (referred to as \u2018viral factories\u2019, \u2018membranous web\u2019 or \u2018replication organelles\u2019). While all +RNA viruses generate replication organelles, the morphology of these organelles varies greatly among virus families. Each virus family hijacks membranes from a different cellular organelle (e.g. Golgi, ER, mitochondria, endosomes or lysosomes), exploits a distinct set of host factors, and modulates specific lipid metabolic pathways to build replication organelles with a unique protein and lipid composition (reviewed in 110\n111).",

Many +RNA viruses use FAs to synthesize lipids to build their replication organelles. PV was reported to enhance uptake and prevent routing of FAs to lipid droplets 64, whereas DENV recruited FAS to its replication organelles and increased the activity of the enzyme to ensure high amounts of local FA synthesis 66. Also other viruses, e.g. WNV, require FAS activity, as their replication is inhibited by FAS inhibitors 59. Furthermore, the cellular energy regulator AMPK, which is an inhibitor of FAS, restricted infection of a number of unrelated viruses including the \u2010RNA virus Rift Valley Fever Virus 68 and HCV. At least HCV actively counteracts this restrictive mechanism by inactivating AMPK 112. Finally, not only the amount of FAs may be important, but also chain length and saturation. PV specifically enhances the uptake of long chain FAs 64 and the replication of HCV and the integrity of its membranous web depend on the enzyme stearoyl\u2010CoA desaturase 1, which converts the saturated FA stearate into the mono\u2010unsaturated FA oleate 113.",

HCV utilizes predominantly PI4KIII\u03b1 to generate large pools of PI(4)P in its membranous web that are essential for viral RNA replication 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 114, 115. PI4KIII\u03b1 activity was shown to be important for the integrity of the membranous web and the PI(4)P levels affect the phosphorylation status of one of the viral proteins (NS5A), thereby influencing the process of viral RNA replication 40, 44. Enteroviruses (e.g. PV, Coxsackievirus B3 and most probably also the other enteroviruses) on the other hand rely on PI4KIII\u03b2 for a PI(4)P\u2010rich environment in their replication organelles 37, 116, 117. It has been suggested that the PI(4)P\u2010rich environment attracts the viral polymerase to the replication organelles to replicate the viral RNA 37. A new role of PI(4)P in infection was recently uncovered for both HCV and enteroviruses, being the recruitment of oxysterol\u2010binding protein (OSBP) to the replication organelles 60, 63 (see below). Also the replication organelles of the \u2010RNA virus Junin virus were reported to contain PI(4)P, but the significance of this finding is still unclear 118. Recent research into the importance of phospholipids for virus replication has focussed on PI(4)P, but there is emerging evidence that also other phospholipids play a role. In DENV\u2010infected mosquito cells, PE (primarily lysoPE16:0) and PA are upregulated, but the role of these lipids in replication remains to be established 65. Most strikingly, influenza A virus (IAV), a \u2010RNA virus that replicates in the nucleus, upregulates the synthesis of ether\u2010phosphatidylcholine (ether\u2010PC) species in peroxisomes, which appears to be important for replication, although the role of the ether\u2010PCs is unknown 119.",

OSBP is an important regulator of cellular lipid homeostasis that shuttles cholesterol from ER to Golgi 121. It is suggested that in infected cells OSBP is important for the accumulation of cholesterol (category E) on the replication organelles 60, 63. To accommodate the requirements for cholesterol, HCV upregulates the synthesis of cholesterol (and FAs) via SREBP activation 122, whereas enteroviruses, which shut down host protein synthesis, acquire cholesterol by increasing uptake of the lipid and possibly by rerouting cholesterol from lipid droplets 61, 62. The roles of cholesterol in virus replication have only begun to be unravelled. For HCV, OSBP and cholesterol appear to be important for the integrity of the membranous web 60. Enteroviruses were proposed to require cholesterol for optimal proteolytic processing of viral proteins by a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated 61, although a role in replication organelle organization similar to HCV remains possible. Other viruses also require cholesterol or modulate its synthesis for efficient replication (e.g. DENV, Norwalk virus; 51\n58), although the role of cholesterol in the replication of these viruses is still under investigation. Interestingly, hepatitis B and C viruses, which are in distinct virus families, accumulate the cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates 7\u2010dehydrocholesterol and desmosterol respectively 123, 124. The importance of these lipids for infection is not known, but their function may extend beyond that of mere biosynthetic intermediates.",

Cholesterol\u201025\u2010hydroxylase, which synthesizes the cholesterol derivative 25\u2010hydroxycholesterol (25HC) (category E), was found to be such an ISG 129 and 25HC levels were highly elevated upon infection 130. 25HC was suggested to alter the properties of host and virus membranes (e.g. IAV, HIV and EBOV) and reduce their permissiveness for fusion 129. Additionally, 25HC inhibits the synthesis of a wide variety of lipids and thus may restrict viruses that require lipid synthesis. Another ISG, IFITM3, was reported to disrupt OSBP function and alter cellular cholesterol homeostasis, which inhibited infection of at least two different enveloped viruses 131. However, viruses in turn have developed mechanisms to neutralize the innate defense mechanism.

Pathogenic species such as the relatively common Trichophyton (causing athlete's foot), Crytococcus neoformans (causing meningoencephalitis) and Aspergillus spp. (causing infections of ear, eye and nails) are often opportunistic and systemic infections normally only occur in immunocompromised individuals 185. Thus, fungi do not typically enter the host cell but affect host lipid metabolism by extracellular secretion of factors. Indeed, fungi are rich sources for molecules that interact with the lipid metabolism of mammals. Particularly, well studied are molecules that interfere with various steps in the synthesis of sphingolipids because of their applicability in fundamental research and cancer therapy 186, 187. Sphingolipids are key molecules in protein trafficking, lipid homeostasis and cell differentiation and their balanced occurrence is essential. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first, committing\u2010 and rate limiting step in sphingolipid de novo synthesis. Sphingofungins, lipoxamycin and myriocin are fungal structural analogs of the SPT intermediate\u2010 or end products with potent and highly selective inhibitory activities 188, 189. Also subsequent steps in the synthesis of the sphingolipid backbone are efficiently inhibited by fungal metabolites: ceramide synthase is sensitive to Fumonisins (isolated from Fusarium verticillioides), AAL\u2010toxin (Alternaria alternata) and Australifungins (nonpathogenic Sporormiella australis) 190, 191, 192. It is interesting to note that all these fungi\u2010derived molecules interfere with early steps in sphingolipid synthesis, i.e. prior to the synthesis of sphingomyelin in host cells (Figure 2C). This is probably related to the fact that after the synthesis of (dihydro\u2010)ceramide, the fungal\u2010 and mammalian anabolic metabolism of phosphosphingolipids diverge. Whereas mammals synthesize SM, fungi use inositol as an headgroup, leading to inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), which plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of Cryptococcus neoformans\n193, 194. Therefore, these inhibitors are also potent antifungals and it has been suggested that these inhibitors are used to gain advantage over fungi competing for the same resources 185.",

Phospholipases are hydrolytical enzymes that degrade membrane phospholipids, leading to membrane dysfunction or even disruption of the cell. In this case, targeting of the most abundant host cell membrane phospholipids, PC and PE, is effective in interference with membrane integrity (Figure 2C). The action of phospholipases also results in the generation of bioactive signaling molecules. In the case of phospholipase C action, diacylglycerol is generated which leads to activation of protein kinase C and tilts the survival/death balance toward survival and proliferation. In the case of phospholipase A or B, FAs are released that can be consumed by fungi and/or oxidized to generate potent signaling molecules with a profound impact on the immune system. These oxidation products are derived from PUFAs in the host cell. Arachidonic acid is used as a precursor in the generation of eicosanoids, a family of oxygenated C20 fatty acids that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes 195 (Figure 2D). Enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid is achieved by the actions of either lipo\u2010oxygenases, cyclooxigenases or CYP enzymes, but also nonenzymatic reactions (lipid peroxidation) can lead to the formation of bioactive arachidonic acid metabolites known as isoprostanes 196. Similarly, other PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) or docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) can serve as precursors for bioactive oxidation products in mammalian hosts. Analysis of the genomes of numerous fungi suggests the ubiquitous presence of enzymes forming oxidized FAs 197.

Similar results were obtained for entry of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani into macrophages and Trypanosoma cruzi into HeLa cells, as cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane inhibited entry of the parasite 224, 225, 226.",

Although Plasmodium is unable to synthesize sterols, it does contain cholesterol that must be diverted from host cell compartments and properly delivered to the PV. Interestingly, the PV membrane forms tight associations with the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shortly after invasion and during schizogony 239. The gathering of host ER to the PV membrane offers an attractive mechanism to situate the host lipid biosynthetic machinery in close proximity to the PV and may be reminiscent of the currently intensely investigated organellar contact sites that allow rapid transport and/or exchange of lipids.",

Due to the lack of experimental resolution, most of these studies address the effect of lipid classes.

Notable examples are the role of the ganglioside GM1 as the receptor of cholera toxin (although in this case the importance of the fatty acid composition is not known)240, and a highly specific interaction of a single sphingomyelin species, SM 18, with the transmembrane domain the COPI machinery protein p24 241. Lipidomic and/or metabolomic studies on host\u2013pathogen interactions bear great potential to contribute to advancement of intracellular (lipid) trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells. First of all, systematic lipidomic analysis of lipids allows the simultaneous screening of virtually all lipids in one assay. Second, using mass spectrometry, the analysis can be performed with much higher sensitivity, allowing the identification of minor (signaling) components. Third, the new generation of mass spectrometers has a much higher resolution, allowing precise annotation of molecular species.",

The different types of microbial pathogens do so in a very different way. Simple (unicellular and prokaryotic) microbial pathogens such as bacteria target host cell lipids that are generally not synthesized by bacteria. These include structural membrane lipids such as cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine as well as signaling lipids such as phosphoinositides and sphingomyelin. In addition, they target neutral lipids for fatty acid production for a variety of functions. In broad outlines, viruses and bacteria target the same group of lipids (compare Figure 2A and B) with one notable exception: whereas several viruses target PS in the host cells, this is only sporadically reported for bacteria. The complex eukaryotic microbial pathogens, fungi and parasites, interact with the host cell lipidome in a very different way as compared to bacteria and viruses (compare Figure 2C and D with Figure 2A and B). The most notable differences between \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018complex\u2019 microbial pathogens are (i) the lack of cholesterol and signaling lipid (phosphoinositides and sphingomyelin) targeting by fungi and parasites; and (ii) the abundant targeting of the eicosanoid pathways in the host cells by fungi and parasites, often dealing with systemic inflammations in the host organism.",

TAG species generally contain saturated and mono/di unsaturated fatty acids with an average chain length of 16\u201318 carbon atoms.
