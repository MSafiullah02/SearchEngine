This is because a clinician might recognise a problem but be unable to fix it without the support of his or her institution, whereas at other times the problem might be invisible to the clinician (eg, if a patient who should have been transferred to an intensive care unit [ICU] dies before transfer, the ICU clinician will not know). Additionally, clinicians are usually unaware of the extent to which the overall provision of resources is adequate for a population.",

Financial pressures faced by the hospital will affect the level of provision of ICU services. Also, the prevailing professional culture can affect who is admitted to the ICU, how they are treated, and how the ICU is staffed.",

One might expect improved care if other staff, such as managers, were better informed about key clinical issues. Clinical education programmes for non-clinical staff have been started in the UK but we are unaware of any formal evaluation of such initiatives. Similarly, there are no national standards or requirements for clinical education of non-clinical staff in the USA.

For example, the morbidity and mortality of meningococcal septicaemia in children might be reduced if parents have greater awareness of the need for prompt admission to hospital and aggressive resuscitation.11, 12, 13 Similarly, a public well-educated about the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) might comply better with preventive strategies and quarantine procedures.14, 15\n",

The data were to be used to drive purchasing decisions and, through their public reporting, stimulate improvements in health-care quality.27 Although there might have been an improvement in outcome over time, it was unclear whether this was driven by the data collection and reporting,28 and after 4 years the programme was shut down because of cost, lack of clear benefit, and reluctance of some institutions to continue participating.",

In addition to considering collection of risk-adjusted outcome data, JCAHO has proposed other ICU quality measures, including catheter-related infection rates, ICU physician staffing patterns, and compliance with several evidence-based ICU processes of care, such as ventilator weaning protocols.42 This level of detail, measuring actual patients' care processes and outcomes, is part of a broader initiative by JCAHO to develop and implement rigorous quality assessments. In view of the importance of JCAHO accreditation, the use of these measures could have profound, and hopefully beneficial, effects on ICU care in the US.

The courtroom, which is explicitly about assigning blame, would seem to have little role in this framework. Yet, an interesting phenomenon of medical malpractice in the USA has been the evolving definition of a professional standard of care. Over the last two centuries, the courts have moved from a definition that was locally-defined and based on subjective expert testimony to one that is nationally representative and grounded in strong scientific evidence.45 As such, the courts increasingly represent a venue in which, theoretically, best evidence-based medicine could be promoted and enforced, and some have argued that legal deterrence is essential in the promotion of health-care quality and patient safety.45\n",

First, the responsibility for clinical processes can be shifted between professions, most commonly involving nurses taking on tasks traditionally performed by doctors. At present, the lack of high quality research on the effect of such changes in the care of the critically ill patient precludes clear policy advice.55 Responsibilities can also be transferred by introducing new categories of staff. Physician assistants, developed in the 1960s for primary care, now work in secondary care as well.56 Although their potential role in care of the critically ill is unclear at present, substitution of one profession for another offers another potential approach to improving patients' safety.57\n",

This might range from informal collaborations and referral networks to regionalised care, involving a major reconfiguration of services. The rationale for regionalisation is that scarce, expensive resources can be consolidated in a regional centre where their use can be optimised and staff can gain the most concentrated training and expertise. There are two potential models for regionalisation: close small hospitals and consolidate services in a few, large institutions or create different levels of ICU on the basis of resources and expertise, such as those proposed recently by the American College of Critical Care,61 and triage patients such that the sickest patients are transferred to the highest level ICUs. The second model is more politically acceptable and has already been implemented in neonatal intensive care and trauma care with evidence of improved outcomes.62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 The British Paediatric Association has recommended a similar model for care of critically ill children (>1 month of age) in the UK, although their conclusions can be challenged for lacking a good evidence base.72, 73\n",

Efforts to tie performance measures to financial incentives, such as the JCAHO efforts, hold promise. Greater public education and awareness will be important for generating advocacy and political will for change. Ultimately, however, significant and sustainable improvements in patients' care and safety will demand fairly large changes in the way professions and institutions inter-relate. In particular, greater use of regionalised care, akin to US state trauma systems, and greater use of physician-extenders, such as nurse practitioners, seems warranted.
