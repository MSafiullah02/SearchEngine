On the other hand, despite our improved knowledge of the pathogenesis of asthma, newer medications with fewer adverse effects, and increased standardization of treatment protocols, there has been a paradoxical increase in asthma mortality.

A good history includes current or past history of cough, wheezing, viral respiratory diseases, accompanying allergy symptoms or signs, shortness of breath, and sinus problems. The intensity and characteristics of any breathing sounds should be determined. It is also important to obtain an exposure history to attempt to clarify relevant triggers for asthma exacerbations. This can include indoor allergen exposures, Immunodeficiency syndromes Obesity Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency outdoor pollens, viral upper respiratory infections and exercise, exposure to foods, and an occupational history of both the child (if old enough to be working) and the parents or caregivers. Exposure to day care is also important and environmental tobacco smoke and pollution exposure should also be documented. A past medical history asking about previous hospitalizations, doctor visits, frequent otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, and a complete medication history, including use of nebulizers or inhalers and any other pertinent medications should be elicited. The family history is also important, as asthma has a genetic component.",

The atopic march describes a commonly seen paradigm in which children who are atopic (genetically predisposed to developing allergies) present early in life with atopic dermatitis, then asthma, and finally allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Common allergens can be categorized into either indoor or outdoor allergens. The outdoor allergens are mostly linked to seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereas indoor allergens are linked to perennial allergic rhinitis. There are geographical differences in the seasonal distribution of pollen allergens. Recently, it has been suggested that climate change may be impacting the prevalence of various outdoor allergens through different mechanisms. In addition, environmental exposures and host factors can lead to changes in an individual's sensitivities throughout life. Certain allergens, such as dust mite, cat and dog dander, and Aspergillus are independent risk factors for the development of symptoms of asthma in children under 3 years of age (4).",

There are several important changes. Firstly, the main goal of asthma treatment is control of symptoms and disease. A list of specific goals to target control is given in Table 6 . Better distinction is made between monitoring asthma control and classifying asthma severity. Severity is defined as the intrinsic intensity of asthma and is still grouped into the original classification of mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. Categorizing severity in this manner is helpful for initiating therapy. Control is defined as the response to therapy, in terms of the degree to which manifestations of asthma are kept to a minimum. Therapy should be adjusted periodically in order to maintain control. The second major change is the focus on impairment and risk. These are the two key domains of control and severity, and provide additional information or parameters to assess response to treatment. Impairment is defined as the extent to which standard goals of asthma treatment are maintained, so this includes the frequency and intensity of symptoms and interference with good quality of life, such as an inability to conduct normal daily activities. Risk can include several parameters -the likelihood of developing an asthma exacerbation, the risk of side effects of medications, and the risk of declining lung function or lung growth.",

Because we spend up to a third of our time sleeping in close quarters with dust mites, the bedroom should have a high priority when developing an indoor allergen avoidance program. Dust mites require water to survive, and damp environments allow them to reproduce and proliferate. Keeping the relative humidity of the home around 50-55% will help keep dust mite concentrations down. In addition, the uses of mattress and pillow encasings, as well as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are additional control measures that may provide benefit. The child with asthma should also not be the one to vacuum as the action of vacuuming can disturb dust mite reservoirs and release these particulates into the breathing zone. Good ventilation and filtration systems in the home can also help to reduce exposure. Additional measures of allergen avoidance are illustrated in Fig. 4 .",

Measurement of spirometry before and after bronchodilation treatment can help determine if there is reversibility of lung function. Because sometimes patient history, especially in children, can be inaccurate, spirometry provides an objective assessment of the child's condition. Spirometry can be attempted at about 4-5 years of age, but at these very young ages, obtaining reliable results depends on the child's ability to follow instructions and their physical coordination. Data on predicted values of spirometry parameters have been obtained by several investigators and are dependent on age, gender, height, and ethnic background. However, as in the case of peak flow measurement, there is significant individual variability, and it is important to establish each child's baseline spirometry. Obviously, as the child grows, this will change, so frequent updates may be needed.

With the proper teaching, even a 5 year old can learn to use a peak flow meter effectively (Fig. 5) . Usually, peak flow measurements are done in the morning and in the evening, but the peak flow meter can be used throughout the day or night, whenever necessary. Most new peak flow meters are small enough to fit in a pocket or a purse. Traditional peak flow meters are available for children and adults. The low range peak flow meters usually measure up to about 450 L/m, while the high range measure up to 800 L/m. The peak flow zonal system, based on the child's personal best peak flow, is a convenient and simple method for parents and patients to assess how they are doing, whether to administer a breathing treatment, and whether to seek additional help. Electronic versions of peak flow meters are also available. These have the advantage of being able to record and store data that can be analyzed and trended on a computer. Some of the newer electronic versions can also measure FEV1, which is considered to be a more reliable measurement of airway obstruction as it is not as dependent on patient technique or effort. An assortment of peak flow meters and spacers is shown in Fig. 6 .",

Most of these have been attributed to oral or parenteral steroids. In children with asthma, the major concerns regarding inhaled or nebulized steroids have been the effect on growth (27) . Studies to determine if inhaled corticosteroids indeed have such an effect are difficult to conduct because asthma itself has been associated with growth retardation (28) . Results have therefore been inconsistent; however, the bulk of the evidence suggests that even if there is growth retardation, this is usually reversible, and there is a period of \"catch-up\" growth. Moreover, even if corticosteroids do indeed affect growth, the extent of growth retardation is minimal. Thus, the risk of growth retardation is small compared to the potential for serious asthma exacerbations. Adrenal suppression in children on inhaled steroids is also not a significant problem. In a study of 14 children on a dry-powder beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler, there was no suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (29) . The dose of beclomethasone was 12-25 mg/kg/day. Other studies have failed to demonstrate adverse effects on the HPA axis (30) . On the other hand, use of high doses of fluticasone has been shown to cause HPA axis suppression (31) . It is not known if there is any clinical significance to these observed effects.

            "text": "LABAs are available either alone or in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. The two available LABAs currently available are salmeterol xinafoate and formoterol fumarate. Salmeterol xinafoate possesses a long hydrocarbon chain connecting the binding site with the active site of the molecule. Theoretically, this conformation allows repetitive interaction between the active site and the target receptor, as the binding site is firmly attached to an alternate site on the cell membrane and the long chain acts as a tether. Salmeterol is indicated down to age 4. It used to be available as an MDI and the diskus, but now only the diskus is available. The dose per puff in the diskus is 50 mg and should be taken twice daily. The terminal elimination half-life of salmeterol is 5.5 h. Formoterol is available in an aerolizer, a dry powder device in which a capsule must be punctured in a specialized chamber. A total of 12 mg of drug is contained in one capsule. Formoterol is also dosed twice daily. The mean elimination half-life of formoterol in healthy subjects is 10 h. The structures of salmeterol and formoterol are illustrated in Fig. 11 . The LABAs are not generally considered first-line treatment for persistent asthma and the current recommendation is that it be used as an add-on therapy. Recently, case reports appeared in the literature of asthma-related deaths associated with salmeterol use. The FDA subsequently attached a black box warning on increased asthma-related deaths to the LABA class of drugs. The issue is, however, still under significant debate due to the presence of other confounding variables that may or may not have been taken into account in the studies. The recommendation for the use of LABAs is to discontinue the LABA once the patient's asthma has been stabilized and control of his/her asthma has been achieved. It remains to be seen if there will be adverse consequences of such a recommendation (32) .",

Systemic steroids, administered orally or parenterally on a chronic basis, are associated with a long list of adverse effects, many of which are potentially more serious than the disease they are being used to treat. These side effects are listed in Table 10 . One important side effect that is sometimes forgotten is osteonecrosis. While corticosteroidinduced osteonecrosis is more common in autoimmune diseases and transplant patients than in asthma, one should still have a high index of suspicion when treating an asthmatic child who has been on steroids for a long time (44) . Generally speaking, a short course of steroids to treat an asthma exacerbation is acceptable from a risk benefit standpoint. In this case, if the corticosteroid course is less than 7 days, no tapering of dose is needed. A tapering schedule should be formulated for those patients in whom steroids are being used for longer than 1 week. If the patient requires multiple courses of steroids, then the possibility of developing serious side effects should be considered.",

Inhaled albuterol or terbutaline provides relief for up to 1 h during exercise. Other short-acting bronchodilators that have been used in EIA include fenoterol and bitolterol. Oral bronchodilators have provided longer relief, up to 6 h for albuterol and 2-5 h for terbutaline. Cromolyn and nedocromil have been found to protect against EIA for 120 and 300 min, respectively. Theophylline has also been used in EIA, but the narrow therapeutic window and the lack of benefit observed at lower doses has hindered its widespread use. The use of ipratropium bromide in EIA has not produced consistent results.

The devices have undergone significant evolution since then and now are the most common device to carry and administer drugs to treat asthma. Dry powder inhalers (DPI) are an alternative to MDIs. While the ability to deliver drug straight to the airways has revolutionized asthma treatment, the use of these devices in children presents some special considerations. The most important of these is the ability of young children to use these devices effectively. Specifically, this is the ability of the child to (1) understand how to use them and (2) be coordinated enough to use them accurately and effectively. MDIs require considerable more coordination than DPIs, although spacer devices do help. If a child is found to be unable to effectively use one of these devices, then it would be much more beneficial to the asthmatic child to continue with the use of nebulizers. A comparison of the various drug delivery devices is given in Table 15 . The table also shows the most common age at which these inhalers can typically be used, although it is important to appreciate that there is a significant variability to these ages.",

On the other hand, a child's asthma can vary during their childhood and even into adulthood. Asthma is dependent on having a genetic predisposition and clinically, is modulated by the environment. Environmental modulation can stem from allergenic exposure, exposure to other agents such as endotoxin, irritants, ozone, particulates, and even temperature. Hormones can also play a role in asthma, as suggested by the interesting observation that in pregnancy, women who have asthma have an equal chance of their asthma worsening, improving, or remaining unchanged. What is known, however, is that asthma is an inflammatory disease that results in bronchoconstriction. Successful treatment of the asthmatic means control of the inflammation. Failure to control inflammation results in chronic obstructive lung disease, as in the case of the cigarette smoker. The introduction of inhaled corticosteroids over the past few decades has greatly improved asthma care, and probably will prove to have a beneficial effect on long-term sequelae of asthma. The persistently high mortality from asthma is probably more related to patient and provider education and compliance than anything else. This is why treatment of asthma requires a comprehensive management plan that incorporates all facets of treatment, including environmental control, medications, education, and immunotherapy (Fig. 16) . Regular monitoring is important to minimize the morbidity of chronic asthma. ",

Early experience in the United States suggests that it is of comparable efficacy to SCIT, but with significantly diminished side effects or risk of anaphylaxis. One potential drawback of SLIT compared to SCIT is the lack of supervision associated with self-administration of oral or sublingual extracts. Better patient education may circumvent this objection, however, and SLIT may yet become widely used in the treatment of asthma. The other potential road block with SLIT is the absence of an established regimen for prescribing SLIT in polysensitized individual. A study of 51 polysensitized children with allergic rhinitis and/or mild to moderate asthma treated with SLIT for 1 year showed an improvement in symptoms of allergic rhinitis severity and classification, nasal, ocular and bronchial symptoms, and medication use. While the majority (42) of these children was treated with a single allergen, seven were treated with two or more extracts and experienced benefit as well (59) .

Multiple studies have shown that management by an asthma specialist (especially allergists) leads to reduced morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life. Treatment by a specialist leads to fewer hospitalizations, fewer exacerbations requiring emergency care, better quality of life, and better outcomes. However, the availability of financial resources, and more important, the failure to properly allocate such resources can be such an economic burden that optimal systems of healthcare are not implemented. As a result of this, many asthmatic children receive the bulk of their care from generalists and even mid-level practitioners, even in those cases where referral to a specialist may be indicated.",

Asthma educators who may be nurses or even medical assistants who are specially trained may help, but no financial resources are actually devoted to this form of medical care. Too many patients with asthma are not well controlled and eventually end up in an urgent care or emergency department, at many times the cost of prevention. A list of recommendations for referral to a specialist is given in Table 20 . These should be considered the very minimum requirements for referral to a specialist. Table 20 indications for referral to a specialist summAry Since our last edition, the treatment of asthma in children has become more standardized, at least amongst allergy and asthma specialists. Inhaled corticosteroids have become the first-line medical treatment of asthma in all age groups. There is still debate on the preferred add-on therapy, the options being increasing the dose of steroids, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonists, or adding a LABA, but all of these options are acceptable, and should be tailored and customized for each individual child with asthma. Future research may be able to identify which treatment might be preferred based on the patient's pharmacogenetics, but we have not yet reached this point. Environmental control has become a mainstay in asthma treatment, and new modes of immunotherapy have contributed to a significant less morbidity over the past two or three decades. Hospitalization rates of asthmatic children have decreased, drugs with high rates of side effects such as theophylline have been replaced, and quality of life has improved. Most children with asthma are able to enjoy very normal lives, compete in sports at a high level and have very few missed school or work days, as long as they are compliant with their asthma management plan.",

Another main issue, which may become even more of a problem in the face of cost-cutting measures associated with a variety of health care reform ideas, involves the access to specialist care. There is also some concern that health care reform in the United States may lead to an overall reduction in access to care to any healthcare provider, let alone the asthma specialist. From a scientific standpoint, the future of pediatric asthma is bright. Research is ongoing to better understand the pathophysiology of asthma, and in doing so, developing new pharmaceuticals to treat asthma. Knowledge of the genetic basis for asthma and how children react to asthma medications will help guide us in developing a personal care plan for the treatment of each child with asthma. Hopefully, this will lead to further improvements in the outcomes of asthmatic children.",
