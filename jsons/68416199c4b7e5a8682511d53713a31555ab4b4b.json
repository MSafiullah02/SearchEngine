Unconditional raw asset prices are certainly well described by suitable random walks that contain no predictability whatsoever. Our experience as practitioners suggest that predictability is best found conditionally and that linear regressions are not the most efficient tools to uncover non-randomness in this context. There is essentially no linear price return auto-correlation; however some significant cross-correlation are found (in sample) between changes of SVI and future price returns. One would be tempted to conclude that GT data do contain more exploitable information than price returns. In our opinion, using such methods prevents one to ask the right question and to assess properly the predictability content of either type of data. We propose that one should first build a non-linear prediction algorithm and then feed it with either past returns, GT data, or both, and finally compare the respective performance of each case.",

But prediction about the future in the past is even harder because it often seem easier than it should. It is prone to many kinds of biases that may significantly alter its reliability, often positively [Freeman, 1992 , Leinweber, 2007 . Most of them are due to the regrettable and possibly inevitable tendency of the future to creep into the past. Any small leak from the future may empower an unbiased random strategy into a promising candidate for speculative trading. Let us now look closely at how this happens when trying to find predictability in GT data. The procedure goes as follows: The rest of the paper is devoted to discuss each of the above steps.",

For instance assume that an increase in SVI with respect to its moving average should be followed by a negative return. The same kind of strategies is found in Kristoufek [2013] who proposes to build a portfolio whose asset weights decrease as a function of their respective SVI. All this is unsatisfactory. There is no reason indeed why a given relationship should hold for the whole period (they do not, see below) and for all stocks.

We focus here on the components of the S&P 100 index.

A distressing number of papers use keywords from the future to backtest strategies, for instance , Choi and Varian [2012] , Janetzko [2014] . One gross error is to think of the keywords that could have been relevant in the recent past, for instance debt, AIG, crisis, etc. instead of trying to think of ones which will be relevant. But a much more subtle error is common: to take a set of keywords that is vague enough and eternally related to finance, for instance finance, and to find related keywords with Google Sets [Preis et al., 2013, Choi and Varian, 2012] . This service suggests a collection of keywords related to a given set of keywords and is accessible in a spreadsheet from docs.google.com. We entered a single keyword, finance, and asked for related keywords. We did not obtain any fancy keywords (restaurant, color, cancer, etc.) as in , but did find the celebrated keyword debt, among others. The problem is that one cannot ask Google Sets in 2014 what was related to finance in 2004. As a consequence, the output of Google Sets introduces information from the future into a backtest. Since, as far as we know, Google Sets does not provide a wayback machine, it must not be used at all to augment one's set of keywords used to backtest a strategy. This shows that the choice of keywords is a crucial ingredient.",

Correcting them needs at least a null hypothesis, i.e. a null set of keywords known before the start of the backtest period. This is why we collected GT data for 200 common medical conditions/ailments/illnesses, 100 classic cars and 100 all-time best arcade games that we trust were known before 2004 (cf. appendix A) and applied the strategy described in with k = 10. Table 1 reports the t-statistics (t-stats henceforth) of the best three positive and negative performances (the latter can be made positive by inverting the prescription of the strategy, transaction costs permitting) for each set of keywords, including the one from . Our brain is hard-wired to make sense of noise and is very good at inferring false causality. We let the reader ponder about what (s)he would have concluded if bone cancer or Moon Patrol were more finance-related. This table also illustrates that the best t-stats associated to the keyword set of are not significantly different from what one would obtain by chance: the t-stats reported here being a mostly equivalent to Gaussian variables for time series longer than, say, 20, one expects 5% of their absolute values to be larger that 1.95.

It used to be made of real numbers whose normalization was not completely transparent; it also gave uncertainties on these numbers. Quite consistently, the numbers themselves would change within the given error bars every time one would download data for the same keyword. Nowadays, GT returns integer numbers between 0 and 100, 100 being the maximum of the time-series and 0 its minimum; small changes of GT data are therefore hidden by the rounding process (but precision is about 5% anyway) and error bars are no more available. This format change is very significant: for instance, the process of rounding final decimals of prices sometimes introduces spurious predictability, which is well known for FX data [Johnson, 2005] . In the case of GT data, any new maximum increases the granularity of the data, thereby making it even less reliable. It is one of the reasons members of quantopedian.com could not replicate the results of before the GT data set was released by the authors [Cuantopian.com, 2014] .

This may be due to the fact that the backtest system just learns to recognize trends unconditionally, in other words, that the predictors are simply equally useless. We therefore remove some information content from the predictors. This is done for example by computing a rolling median of each predictor; a value of the predictor is now reduced to a binary number which encodes which side of the previous median it belongs to. We then use exactly the same backtesting system as before with the same parameters. The performance associated to GT data and price returns is now unambiguous (Fig. 4) .

Assuming that this is not due to us not using the right method, our findings suggest that Google Trends data are equivalent to price return themselves. They do share indeed many properties with price returns: they are aggregate signals created by many individuals, they reflect something related to the underlying assets. In addition both are very noisy: the uncertainty about GT data, gathered from their previous file format, is about 5%. From this point of view, there is nothing miraculous or ground-breaking about GT data. We had to use sophisticated non-linear methods coupled with a careful backtest procedure, which contrasts with the much simpler approaches usually seen in current academic literature. Why it was needed at all is probably because it is hard to guess at first what an increase in SVI means, since it may be related to good news (e.g. higher interest from potential customers), or bad ones (e.g. worry about the company itself), or both, or neither. Indeed, such data include too many searches unrelated to the financial assets for a given keyword, and even many more unrelated to actual trading. As a consequence, adding another signal based on the change of the number of news related to a given asset helps to interpret what a change of SVI means [Wang, 2012 , Cahan, 2012 . Another possibility is to use other sources of data, such as Twitter or Wikipedia , which have the invaluable advantage of being available at a much higher frequency. At any rate, we challenge the community to show that for a given backtest system, predictors based on weekly Google Trends data only are able to outperform predictors based on price that themselves yield about 17bps per week including 2bps transaction costs.",
