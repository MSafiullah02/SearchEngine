Donor testing for antibodies to syphilis began in 1938.7 Bacterial infections, a major threat at the time of World War II, were later decreased by cold storage of whole blood and red blood cells (RBCs) in plastic containers.5, 7 In the 1970s, transfusion\u2010associated hepatitis (TAH) was largely prevented by near elimination of paid donation through product labeling to identify paid collections, concurrent with testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.5 However, the medical importance of the residual hepatitis risk, mostly attributed to non\u2010A, non\u2010B hepatitis (NANBH), was recognized slowly.5 With the acute threat of bacterial infections largely controlled, syphilis effectively prevented, and the full consequences of NANBH transmission unappreciated, the blood community in the late 1970s was more focused on systemic issues of economic competition and supply instabilities than on transmissible disease.

However, despite a number of high\u2010level federal meetings, actions by the national government to contain the AIDS risk from transfusion were not undertaken until 1983.8 Although transfusion transmission of HIV undoubtedly took place at least 5 years before the recognition of TAA due to the very long asymptomatic period of the disease, the delay in a response to TAA subsequent to these initial reports of disease in persons with hemophilia and transfusion recipients also contributed to the AIDS tragedy. Rage within the hemophilia community, due both to the fact of transmission of a fatal infection and to the failure of authorities to provide adequate warnings and preventions, was expressed in a demand for a congressional investigation. Members of Congress instead directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to look into the matter. This was accomplished through a contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study the evolving HIV\u2010related events impacting blood safety and the decision\u2010making process in this crisis period.",

These failures to act more rapidly and aggressively in the face of TAA were seen to unmask an underlying weakness in the ability of federal agencies to address a new threat in the face of substantial scientific uncertainty. This weakness was attributed to systemic deficiencies, primarily of leadership and coordination. In particular, the IOM criticized the federal agencies for lack of top\u2010level leadership needed to overcome inherent bureaucratic inertia; absence of a systematic approach within advisory committees sufficient to maintain their focus; over dependency on the regulated industry as a source of data given the inherent conflict of interest; and failure to engage in forward thinking both with respect to new technologies and emerging safety threats. As a consequence, the risk of TAA was severely underestimated; patients and care providers were not suitably warned of the risk; and resistance to a change in the status quo caused delayed intervention. In a set of 14 recommendations directed primarily at federal agencies, the IOM called for a more responsive and integrated decision\u2010making process including establishment of a Blood Safety Council reporting to a designated Blood Safety Director within HHS and a standing \u201cexpert panel\u201d to assure communication of blood product risks and alternatives to their use both to care providers and to the public. Specifically to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the IOM recommended that, \u201cWhere uncertainties or countervailing public health concerns preclude eliminating potential risks, the FDA should encourage, and where necessary require, the blood industry to implement partial solutions that have little risk of causing harm.\u201d While not itself a mandate, the IOM's admonition that the FDA should institute measured precautions in the face of uncertainty has become a dominant factor in blood safety decision making. A more vigilant and proactive FDA approach to blood safety unfortunately has had the unintended consequence of dramatically increasing the manufacturing costs and therefore the price of blood.10\n",

The present structure includes the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) as the blood safety director; heads of Public Health Service and related agencies as members of a Blood, Organ and Tissue Safety Executive Council (BOTSEC); and an HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee for Blood and Tissue Safety and Availability (formerly the Advisory Committee for Blood Safety and Availability). The ASH is the acknowledged national blood safety director with final responsibility and authority for decisions regarding blood safety and availability. An interagency Blood, Organ and Tissue Safety Working Group meets monthly by teleconference, more often when necessary, and the BOTSEC meets approximately quarterly face to face with the ASH to provide information and guidance regarding current and emerging issues involving the nation's blood supply.11 Unlike FDA's Blood Products Advisory Committee, whose function is to provide external scientific advice relevant to regulation, the Secretary's advisory committee is empowered to discuss broad legal, ethical, social, and economic issues affecting the blood system. To give voice to patient concerns, both advisory committees seat voting representatives of communities that have been particularly affected by TAA. Additionally, in response to a series of congressional hearings, reports from the Government Accountability Office, and the IOM study, the FDA developed and HHS subsequently adopted a comprehensive \u201cblood action plan\u201d12 designed to address the identified shortcomings, to ensure greater coordination among the department's public health agencies, and to increase the effectiveness of the FDA's scientific and regulatory activities. Notably, the post\u2010TAA era has witnessed an aggressive effort by the FDA to improve blood safety through enforcement of cGMP in blood product collection and processing aligned with the model of pharmaceutical manufacturing and a more formal relationship than blood establishments experienced in the past. The FDA initiative also involved promotion of automation to reduce human errors, including use of validated blood bank software. An intensive program of field inspections designed to assure universal regulatory compliance of blood collection establishments resulted in a number of court\u2010enforced voluntary injunctions (consent decrees).",

From the CDC perspective, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss how to reduce the risk of AIDS in transfusion recipients and persons with hemophilia in the absence of a test for the etiologic agent. Several possible strategies were presented, including deferral of blood donations by persons known to be at increased risk for AIDS and the use of surrogate tests to identify persons at increased risk of transmission, such as those with detectable antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti\u2010HBc) or low CD4/CD8 T\u2010cell ratios.

Bulk preparations of the virus, known at the time as HTLV\u2010III, were provided by the National Cancer Institute to diagnostics companies for the development of antibody detection tests. The first such screening test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, was approved by the FDA in March 1985. Because of concerns that persons would donate blood for the purpose of learning their HIV infection status, the CDC funded the first alternative HIV test sites, where individuals could obtain free and confidential testing. Blood banks also established the option of confidential unit exclusion to allow persons who had donated blood to confidentially indicate that the blood should not be used for transfusion. A watershed event in blood safety was the statement by the FDA commissioner at a September 1994 workshop that nucleic acid technology should be implemented to close the window period for HIV detection by serology. This technology had been considered too costly and cumbersome for practical application in blood banking. The introduction of direct testing for HIV in donor blood, first by p24 antigen assays, which proved largely unproductive,13 and then by nucleic acid tests (NATs) for viral RNA, which proved beneficial, put to rest a decade of concern about residual HIV risk from donations in the 3\u2010 to 6\u2010week infectious \u201cwindow period\u201d before seroconversion dependent on the sensitivity of different screening tests. The successful adaptation of NAT to donor screening, including testing of specimens in small pools of 16 to 24, established a new era in risk reduction from transfusion\u2010transmitted viral diseases. In addition to increasing the safety of transfused blood, HIV antibody screening of donors led to \u201clookback\u201d programs in which recipients of previous unscreened donations from infected donors were identified. These recipients were found to be at substantial risk for infection.14, 15 Although no effective treatment was available at the time, infected recipients could be counseled to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to others.",

In England, Dane and coworkers22 showed by immune electron microscopy that the Australia antigen represented the envelope protein of HBV and it was renamed the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The serologic distinctions between hepatitis A and B were further solidified by the controversial, but definitive prospective studies by Krugman and colleagues23 at the Willowbrook State School. The US government played a pivotal role in these momentous events, first through the initial discovery of the Australia antigen in the intramural program at NIH and then through extensive grant support of the Blumberg laboratory at the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia.",

The Transfusion Transmitted Virus Study, supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, published a retrospective analysis of a prospective study that showed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing of donors might effect a 30% reduction in TAH incidence.33 This was confirmed by a similar analysis of the NIH prospective TAH study,34 but implementation of ALT donor screening at the NIH failed to demonstrate the predicted benefit.35 Similar retrospective testing of the Transfusion Transmitted Virus Study36 and the NIH37 prospective studies suggested that anti\u2010HBc testing might result in a 30% to 40% reduction in TAH, and this fostered the voluntary introduction of ALT and anti\u2010HBc donor testing in 1986 to 1987; the FDA recommended routine donor testing for anti\u2010HBc in 1992. Although anti\u2010HBc screening was introduced specifically to detect HBV carriers who were HBsAg negative (now termed occult hepatitis B), it also served as a surrogate for NANB carriers and for seronegative HIV carriers because of overlapping transmission routes. Had anti\u2010HBc surrogate testing been introduced in the early 1980s it presumably would have prevented some cases of transfusion\u2010transmitted AIDS and NANBH. This delayed implementation was the basis for extensive litigation, but also served as the driver for the IOM recommendation of invoking the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d when weighing new donor screening interventions and this precautionary approach has significantly improved transfusion safety.",

Houghton and associates at Chiron then \u201cwalked\u201d the genome, characterized an antigen derived from the nonstructural region of the viral genome, and developed an antibody assay to detect this viral protein.39 Studies at the NIH40 confirmed that the cloned agent, designated hepatitis C virus (HCV), was detected in virtually all NANBH cases and identified an implicated donor in near 90% of these cases. First\u2010generation anti\u2010HCV testing was introduced in 1990 and second\u2010generation assays in 1992.

Initial efforts to screen blood donors using signs and symptoms of WNV infection proved ineffective.41 In 2002, a total of 4156 cases of human illness were reported, and at least 21 people contracted WNV through transfusion, six of whom died.42 The rapid expansion of WNV across the United States and reported to BOTSEC by the CDC lent urgency to developing a screening test before the next epidemic season.43 The FDA requested that industry develop such a test; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute provided $3.47 million in research support; the American Red Cross provided 35,000 archived specimens; and the FDA facilitated rapid national test implementation and ultimate approval. Although development of blood screening tests usually takes years, the NAT assay for WNV was available for the 2003 epidemic season, building on technology platforms already developed for HIV and HCV.

Based on the available epidemiologic data in 1999, the FDA recommended that blood components collected from donors diagnosed with vCJD be withdrawn and developed a mathematical model for indefinite donor deferral based on geographic exposure (donors who resided in the United Kingdom for a total of 6 months or more, between 1980 and 1996) that eliminated an estimated 87% of donor exposure\u2010days to bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom with a projected loss of approximately 2% of donors, which was considered a difficult balance of safety and supply, necessitating close monitoring of the blood supply.50 Based on continuing surveillance of vCJD, the geographic exclusion was expanded in 2002, providing approximately a 90% reduction in total risk\u2010weighted person\u2010days of donor exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy in western Europe including the United Kingdom with an estimated total donor loss of approximately 7%. The question of blood transmission was answered when the United Kingdom reported four cases of vCJD infections associated with blood transfusion that occurred between 2003 and 2007.51 All four recipients had received transfusions of nonleukoreduced RBCs between 1996 and 1999, which confirmed the long incubation. Only time will tell whether the steps taken in the United States will prove both warranted and sufficient, but the policy reflects adoption of a \u201cpartial solution\u201d when it appears to reduce risk and an attempt to act expeditiously and responsibly with a benefit\u2010to\u2010risk model to address risk in the face of scientific uncertainty.",

Most infections are found in immigrants from Latin America. Whereas most new infections are vector borne, transmission by blood transfusion is well recognized. Six transmissions had been reported in the United States before the ability to screen blood donors.52 As early as 1989, the FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee recognized that while only 20% to 30% of those infected with T. cruzi develop symptomatic disease, the infection is lifelong in the absence of early treatment and can be fatal.53 In view of increasing immigration to the United States from endemic regions, the Blood Products Advisory Committee recommended testing donors when a suitable test became available. Donor history screening proved insufficiently sensitive and specific. Not until 2006 was a test found suitable for licensure. Shortly thereafter, the major blood collectors undertook universal donor screening for antibodies to T. cruzi.",

Nevertheless, to address public concerns as well as the dearth of scientific information regarding blood transmission, the FDA provided prudent but specific recommendations concerning donors with a confirmed medical diagnosis of anthrax or proven colonization with B. anthracis and provided criteria for product quarantine and retrieval related to reports of postdonation illness.59\n",
