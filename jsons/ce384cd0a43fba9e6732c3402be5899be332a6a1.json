Support for this tentative classification has been obtained recently from neutralization and immunofluorescence studies showing an antigenic relationship between FIP virus and the coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine (6, 8, 13) . Numerous attempts to isolate FIP virus in chicken embryos (11, 14) , in primary feline cells (I, 3, 7, 12) and continuous lines (7) have failed; in vitro virus growth could be demonstrated so far only in cultures of cells derived from the peritoneal exudates of kittens after experimental infection with FIP virus (7) . The present report describes the successful propagation of FIP virus in the brain of one-day-old mice. This system was selected since coronaviruses of such diverse species as man, mouse, rat and chicken have been shown to grow in suckling mouse tissues (for review see 4).",

Med., Reihe B, Bd. 25, Heft 4 306 OSTERHAUS, HORZINEK and WIRAHADIREDJA publication (5) the sporadic occurrence of clinical FIP could reflect virus spillover from a non-feline reservoir. Although serology has shown a rather high percentage of healthy cats to possess antibodies (indicating cat-to-cattransmission of the virus), the mouse as predominant prey mammal could still play a role in FIP epidemiology. Since clinical symptoms have never been observed even in older FIP virus infected mice (Osterhaus and Horzinek, unpublished observations), they might be inapparent carriers; this possibility is being investigated.",
