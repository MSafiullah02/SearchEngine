As manifest in the phenomenon of hybrid sterility, these would tend to isolate an individual reproductively from most members of the species to which its close ancestors had belonged, but not from individuals that had undergone the same non-genic variation .

Thu s, the main specie s positively selects itself by negati vely selecting variants. Should these variants find compatible mates, then they might accumulate as a new species that, in turn , would positiv ely select itself by negatively selecting further variants. This is \" spec ies se lection,\" a form of group se lection that many biologists have found hard to imagine. Indeed, Richard Dawkins, hav ing sco rned the \" argume nt from personal incredulity,\" was obliged to resort to it when confro nted with the possibility of species se lection: \" It is hard to th ink of reasons why species survivabi lity should be decoupled from the s um o f the surv ivabilities of the individual members of the spec ies\" [4] . When the latter sentence is parsed its logic see ms imp eccabl e. Hold tight , and we will see if we can work it out. \"The spec ies\" is the establi sh ed main species, members of which imp eril themselves onl y marginally, if at all , by mating with (denying reproductive success to) members of a small potentially incipient species . Thu s, in reproductive interactions between a main and an incipient spec ies, survivability of the main spec ies is coupled negatively to the sum of the survivabilit ies of ind iv idua l members of the incipient specie s (i.e. it surv ive s when they do not survive), much more than it is coupled positively to the sum of the survivabilities of its own individual members (i .e. it s urv ives when they survive). In this sense, main spec ies survivability is coupled to the sum of the survivabilities of individual members of the incipient species, and decoupl ed from the sum of the survivabilities of its own individual members. Of course, by individual survivabilities is meant, not just mer e survival, but survival permitting unimpeded production offertile offspring. Survival of members of an incipient species occurs, not only when cla ssical Darwinian phenotypic interactions are favourable (e.g. escape from a tiger), but also when reprotypic interactions are favourable (e .g. no attempted reproduction with members of the main species). Tigers are a phenotypic threat. Members of the main species are a reprotypic threat [3] .",

Thus, there has been conversion of the sequence of the original M allele to that of the P allele. There has been a loss of heterozygosity (as in (a)) and a gain of homozygosity (as in (d)). In this example, gene conversion involves copies of homologous genes (alleles) on different chromosomes. However, gene conversion can also involve homologous genes (non-allelic \"paralogues\") on the same chromosome (see Fig. 8 -2). Note that, in Chapter 4, sequence 3.1 (P above) is shown to form a stem-loop with the central bases being located in the loop (sequence 4.4). Since the single base-pair difference between P and M versions is in this loop, then the M version has the potential to form a similar stem-loop. Because the loops differ slightly, during the initial homology search loop-loop \"kissing\" interactions might fail and prohibit subsequent steps. However, cross-over points can migrate (e.g.",

In the case of duplicate eukaryotic genes that have diverged in sequence, Koichi Matsuo and his colleagues noted that divergence was greatest at third codon positions, usually involving a change in (G+C)% [30-33]. Thus, there was a codon bias in favour of the positions of least importance for the functional differentiation that would be necessary for the operation of natural selection. Where amino acids had not changed, different gene copies used different synonymous codons. It wa s proposed that the (G+C)% change was an important \"line of defence\" against homologous recombination between the duplicates. Thus, recornbinational isolation of the duplicate (largely involving third codon position differences in (G+C)%) would protect (preserve) the duplicate so allowing time for functional differentiation (largely involving first and second codon position differences), and hence, for natural selection to operate. In the general case, isolation would precede functional differentiation, not the converse.

Indeed, there is evidence supporting this. The sex chromosomes (X and Y) tend not to recombine at meiosis except in a small region (the \"pseudoautosomal\" region; see Chapter 14).

In this case, a further layer of intergenomic (G+C)% differentiation would be imposed upon the previous intragenomic differentiation . Again, when a sufficient degree of reproductive isolation had been achieved this initial barrier between species would usually be replaced by other barriers, thus leaving (G+C)% free to continue differentiating in response to intragenomic demands. However, (G+C)% is never entirely free. It can itself be constrained by demands on gene function (i .e. natural selection) that primarily affect first and second codon positions.
