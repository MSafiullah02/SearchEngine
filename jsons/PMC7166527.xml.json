Recently hMPV was reported to cause outbreaks in long\u2010term care facilities in Canada and the USA with attack rates of 18\u201370% [Boivin et al., 2007; Louie et al., 2007; Marchand\u2010Austin et al., 2009; teWierik et al., 2010]. In Ontario, the proportion of respiratory illness caused by hMPV is variable, peaking in winter months, where it causes up to 27% of outbreaks in the Greater Toronto Area [Marchand\u2010Austin et al., 2009].",

It has been classified into two subtypes, A and B [Huck et al., 2006], based on differences in nucleotide sequences and reactivity patterns with monoclonal antibodies along with in vitro neutralization assays with subgroup\u2010specific antisera. These two subtypes were further divided into distinct subgroups A1, A2, B1, and B2, among which subtype A2 exhibits highest diversity [Huck et al., 2006]. Subtypes A2 and B2 have been found to have additional sublineages or subclusters or clades\u2010 A2a, A2b [Huck et al., 2006], A2b1, A2b2 [Regev et al., 2012], and B2a and B2b [Carr et al., 2008].

A standardized process exists for conducting respiratory outbreak testing in Ontario that involves coordinated efforts between Ontario's public health units, institutions, and Public Health Ontario Laboratories. When an institution or medical officer reports two or more cases of respiratory illness, an outbreak investigation may be initiated by a public health investigator and respiratory specimens are submitted to Public Health Ontario Laboratories for respiratory viral testing. Public Health Ontario Laboratories provides this outbreak testing for institutions such as daycares, special care facilities, long\u2010term care facilities, hospitals, psychiatric, and correctional facilities. Nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens are tested for outbreak investigations based on Public Health Ontario Laboratories testing algorithm, which consists of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) for influenza A and B followed by subtyping of at least one specimen for influenza positive outbreaks. Multiplex respiratory viral PCR that targets a number of viruses including hMPV is also performed. Molecular testing was performed on the first six specimens submitted from each outbreak during the first 2 years of the study and the first four specimens during the final influenza season (November 2011 to February 2012). Commencing in November of each influenza season (defined as October 1 to April 30), an in\u2010house influenza A and B PCR based on CDC protocols, and influenza subtyping based on CDC or in\u2010house assays was performed [Duncan et al., 2011]. In addition, MRVP [(Seeplex RV or Seeplex RV15ACE; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) or Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada)] were used to test for adenovirus, human coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A and B, hMPV, parainfluenza 1\u20104, and RSV. During the final influenza season (November 2011\u2013February 2012), only influenza\u2010negative samples were tested by Multiplex respiratory viral PCR.",

RT\u2010PCR amplification was conducted using primers targeting a 940 bp region of the G gene [Ludewick et al., 2005] and a 780 bp region of the F gene [van den Hoogen et al., 2004]. Amplicons were sequenced using the Big Dye v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the same primers used for amplification. Multiple sequence alignments of the Ontario hMPV strains and hMPV sequences accessed from GenBank for the G gene and F gene were performed by BioEdit (version 7.1.19). Reference sequences were downloaded from GenBank for the various subtypes (sublineages). Reference sequences for the F gene subtype A2b2 that was described recently were kindly provided by Dr. Michal Mandelboim; Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Israel (shown as HMPVG578 and HMPV S5335 in Fig. 2). Phylogenetic analysis for the F gene was done using the reference sequences as provided by Dr. Mandelboim which have been previously used to refer to A2b2 [Regev et al., 2012]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by constructing neighbor\u2010joining trees and each tree topology was statistically analyzed by bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA 5.0) software [Tamura et al., 2011]. Sequences of hMPV isolates obtained from this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers (KC709690\u2010KC709792, KC795605\u2010KC795682 for G\u2010gene and KC709690\u2010KC709781 for F\u2010gene sequences.).",

Four hundred thirty\u2010six specimens collected from 195 (8.5%) of the outbreaks were positive for hMPV. The majority of outbreaks (61.3%) occurred in long\u2010term care facilities followed by retirement homes (3.2%), hospitals (1.8%), psychiatric hospitals (0.75%), camps (0.2%), daycares (0.4%), and schools (0.69%). However, locations for 31.9% of outbreaks were not known as the information was not provided on the laboratory requisitions at the time of specimen submission. All patients showed signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness, which is a prerequisite prior to submitting respiratory specimens for laboratory investigation. The mean and median age of hMPV\u2010positive patients in these outbreaks was 80.7 and 85 years, respectively. Most hMPV positivity was observed in winter and spring each year (Fig. 1). During the immediate period following the second wave of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (December 2009\u2013April 2010), an increased prevalence of hMPV infections was observed, detected in 66 (21%) of 311 outbreaks tested. During the study the predominant viral pathogen detected in all laboratories testing at Public Health Ontario Laboratories was rhinovirus/enterovirus, followed by influenza A, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza, human coronaviruses, and influenza B. During November 2009\u2013March 2010, the percentage of specimens positive for influenza A or rhinovirus/enterovirus was very low, while the percent positivity for RSV, hMPV, and parainfluenza was high.",

[2011] and observed in this study during the 2009\u20132010 influenza season (Fig. 1).
