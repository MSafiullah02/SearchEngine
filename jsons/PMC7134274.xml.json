Even worse, some assume the sheer volume provides greater objectivity, neutrality and accuracy, but \u201cdata are always the result of conscious, subjective decisions on the part of researchers, and are the result of inherently social processes\u201d [1]. The perceived authority or effectiveness is lost by being overwhelmed by all the automatically-collected data, by mistaking omniscience for omnipotence or intelligence: \u201cthe more you know about the secret lives of others, the less powerful you turn out to be!\u201d [2].False precision: digital geographical coordinates are often given to some arbitrary precision based on a data storage decision (eg: single vs double precision), rather than the accuracy of the recording method, giving incorrect perceptions of coordinate accuracy. For example, a point geocoded from a toponym (eg: Tshwane) could have a precision of a second (about 30 m), though the toponym encompasses many square kilometres. False precision also applies to other types of data.Quality: many factors can inhibit the quality of data, but these are often not well understood by the end users.Metadata: documenting data, their quality and characteristics are essential for being able to use the data meaningfully, but metadata is often not well understood by the end users and is often not provided adequately.\n",

While this can be ameliorated through other data, local knowledge and insights, and careful statistical analysis, it is of particular concern when those using the data are blissfully unaware of the bias. Bias also occurs in training sets for models, such as in machine learning. Error is ubiquitous [3].Liability: this could be for incorrect data, which then compromises someone\u2019s rights, endangers safety and security, wastes money and other resources, and so on.Right to exploit content: on the other hand, for some (such as entertainers and artists) it is important to be able to exploit their content publicly which might be inhibited by corporations controlling the content \u2013 analogous to censorship.Censorship: this can be disguised and rationalized as prudent selection, due to the limited budget of a public library, to suppress hate speech, to maintaining literary excellence, to ensure balance and/or to meet the audience\u2019s requirements [4, 5].\n",

Ethical judgement is influenced by the values of a person or group: their convictions of what is good or desirable [8]. Values are determined by different factors, including culture, religion, social and economic status, personal experiences, age, gender and profession. Data are often shared globally and the ethics of using such data is subject to significantly diverse value systems. Normative ethics aims at establishing the norms or standards for appropriate conduct and applied ethics is how these are used to deal with practical moral problems. There are three major approaches in normative ethics, which in practice, are often mixed:Virtue ethics emphasises virtues or moral character as a way of assessing or justifying each and every action or non-action.Consequentialism emphasises the consequences of actions, which can be interpreted as the end justifies the means; andDeontological ethics emphasises duties or rules, which can be reduced to a check list of what to do in different situations [8, 9].\n",

The Panopticon is a circular building with an inspection house in the middle from which a custodian could observe secretly the inmates (around the perimeter) who could not communicate with anyone. Foucault [32] invoked the Panopticon concept1 as a metaphor for the tendency of modern \u201cdisciplinary\u201d societies to observe and attempt to \u201cnormalise\u201d their citizens. \u201cThe panopticon induces a sense of permanent visibility that ensures the functioning of power\u201d [34]. Unsurprisingly, this can lead to limited, or even curtailed, political and personal freedoms, and the loss of self-reliance [35]. Dobson and Fisher [36] took Foucault\u2019s metaphor further, identifying three \u201cpost-panoptic\u201d models:Bentham\u2019s original concept, which they consider to be the one Foucault used;Panopticism II, in the form of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d type of surveillance of [37]; andPanopticism III, technology tracking humans and their activities, such as cell-phone tracking [9, 12, 38], GNSS receivers, RFID2 and geo-fences3. Crucially, the technology for Panopticism III is relatively cheap, effective and widely available to anyone, and not just well-resourced national security agencies.\n",
