This is also the case with medical conspiracy theories. This article reviews some of the most notorious health-related conspiracy theories. It then approaches the reasons why people believe these theories, using concepts from cognitive science. On the basis of that knowledge, the article makes normative proposals for public health officials and health workers as a whole, to deal with conspiracy theories, in order to preserve some of the fundamental principles of medical ethics.",

Although this kind of narratives have existed for a long time, scientists are only beginning to understand why people come to believe them in the first place. The medical world is not spared of these dynamics. Conspiracy theories can do a lot of harm, and that is why there is an urgent need to study them. By better coming to understand how they arise and spread, we can begin to propose concrete measures in order to better educate the public, and prevent them from being captivated by these narratives.",

As early as 1964 Richard Hofstadter (2012) studied the so-called \"paranoid style\" in American politics. But, many observers converge on the idea that Donald Trump's political ascendency has marked a new era of conspiratorial thinking in the United States and other countries under its sphere of influence (Hellinger 2019) . Before being a politician, Trump was a celebrity; and thus, both roles have managed to influence his followers into making conspiracy theories more popular. He is on record for giving credibility to numerous conspiracy theories: global warming is a hoax, Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Rafael Cruz participated in J.F. Kennedy's assassination, Bill Clinton ordered the assassination of Vince Foster, Antonin Scalia was murdered, vaccines cause autism.",

That does not imply that conspiracy theories are necessarily false, because, in some cases, some small evil groups have indeed conspired to bring about unfortunate situations.

Although this paper was thoroughly refuted, it was retracted from the journal where it was published, and most of Wakefield's co-authors have also retracted from their views, it ultimately unleashed a new wave of a moral panic against vaccination (Goldacre 2008) . In recent years there have been occasional outbreaks of measles in affluent areas, and the main factor for this seems to be that parents choose not to vaccinate children, out of fear that they may turn out autistic. In this conspiracy theory, pharmaceutical companies know that vaccines are not safe, but they are still making big profits on them, so they deliberately keep this information hidden.",

That threat is an explanatory framework as to why people believe in conspiracy theories, on a neuroscientific, psychological, and sociological level. Even though these approaches may come from different theoretical perspectives, they complement each other, to the extent that they establish correlations amongst variables, and offer some measure of predictive factors regarding the proclivity to believe conspiracy theories. Inasmuch as the disposition to believe conspiracy theories has some firm biological grounding, I shall approach the way evolutionary theory accounts for specific psychological mechanisms that in human evolution primed us to believe things like conspiracy theories. But, given that conspiracy theories are further developed on account of environmental factors, I shall also examine studies that relate to environmental variables (both psychological and sociological) that facilitate the rise of conspiracy theories.",

One particularly useful tool in the study of how ideas stick comes from the cognitive science of religion: minimally counterintuitive effects. It has been established that belief in conspiracy theories is more associated with intuitive rather than analytic thinking (Swami et al. 2014) . But, conspiracy theories are more popular if they retain an element of minimal counterintuitiveness. As Boyer explains this notion, concepts that violate a few ontological expectations of a category, are more memorable than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts (Boyer 1994) . Religious concepts such as fairies, demigods, healing powers, miracles, and so on, are more easily remembered because they step out of the ordinary, and defy the way things happen conventionally. In the same manner, conspiracy theories stick relatively easily, because they involve concepts that are not so common: there is no expectation that everyday, evil scientists in labs manufacture deadly viruses, or that dentists advance water fluoridation in order to make people more stupid. This appeal to counterintuitive concepts ultimately leads conspiracy theorists to frequently make contradictory claims. For example, research shows that many people who believe Princess Diana staged her death, also believe she was killed by the royal family (Wood et al. 2011) . Likewise, medical conspiracy theories frequently claim that pharmaceuticals profit from making people buy ineffective cures for cancer (and thus letting people die), yet at the same time keep them alive so that they continue to be clients.",

Paranoia works on a personal level (the individual feels personally attacked), whereas conspiracy theories are about threat perception as a group (Van Prooijen and Van Lange 2014).

            "text": "Conspiracy theories are not so much explained by paranoia, but rather, by natural inclinations towards agency detection. Steve Guthrie's (1995) cognitive science of religion is relevant in this regard: according to his theory, religious beliefs come mostly as a result of the human brain's tendency to attribute agency and detect patterns, usually in the form of anthropomorphism. The same principle applies to conspiracy theories. It has been empirically established that the tendency to detect agency in inanimate stimuli predicts belief in conspiracy theories (Imhoff and Bruder 2014) . Evolutionarily, agency detection was an important advantage, as error management theory would predict, under the principle of \"better safe than sorry\" (Haselton 2000) . As Gray and Wegner (2010) explain this principle, under the threat of predators, \"the high cost of failing to detect agents and the low cost of wrongly detecting them\u2026 [suggests] that people possess a Hyperactive Agent Detection Device, a cognitive module that readily ascribes events in the environment to the behavior of agents\". In medical conspiracy theories, unfortunate things (such as, say, the outbreak of some virus) cannot just happen without a purpose. Some agent must be behind it. And thus, instead of accepting that AIDS spread because of contact with chimpanzees in Africa, conspiracy theorists are better satisfied with attributing agency to the whole phenomenon, preferring to believe that some cabal actually designed the deadly virus. Heider and Simmel's (1944) famous experiment of purposeless movements of shapes demonstrated that most subjects tend to attribute intentions and agency to those shapes. Developmental psychologists have long asserted that teleological thinking is deeply enshrined in preschool children (Kelemen 1999) , and understanding randomness requires more mature cognitive functions that not all human beings develop to the same extent. It has been documented that believers of conspiracy theories are even more likely to detect nonexistent patterns in random data (Van Prooijen et al. 2018 ). In fact, many conspiracy theorists acknowledge that their work is mostly about \"connecting the dots\", as in David Icke's Dot Connector video series. Indeed, conspiracy theories frequently fall under the category of \"monological belief systems\" , i.e., a set of interconnected ideas that are mutually reinforcing. Thus, medical conspiracy theories are frequently not just about health issues. They are enshrined in a grander scheme of things, and usually involve the typical suspects: Masons, Illuminati, etc., as well as greater conspiratorial themes, such as the New World Order and population control. This has been very typical of Nancy Turner Banks (2010), a prominent writer about medical conspiracy theories, who frequently brings Jews into her explanations. Conspiracy theorists try to make sense of the world by providing an overly simplistic explanation of phenomena. This is usually done by focusing exclusively on one single idea, and explaining everything else on the basis of that idea.",

First, inasmuch as everything is connected in a grand conspiracy, the single best predictor of belief in one conspiracy theory is belief in a different conspiracy theory (Goertzel 1994) . And second, inasmuch as conspiracy theories reinforce each other, they ultimately become incorrigible: evidence against them is interpreted as evidence of a conspiratorial effort to try to suppress them (Grimmes 2016) , thus confirming the original conspiracy theory. This ultimately becomes a form of cognitive dissonance. As documented by Festinger (1957) in a famous study, whenever individuals strongly adhere to beliefs that turn out not to be true, this causes discomfort. But, only rarely, will individuals acknowledge they are in error. More frequently, individuals will accommodate to that discomfort by adjusting the original belief, so that the evidence against it can now be reinterpreted as confirming the original belief.",

            "text": "It is also true that, inasmuch as conspiracies are enshrined in a grand scheme of things, there is also a tendency to explain big events with big causes. This is the so-called proportionality bias. Conspiracy theorists cannot accept that something as big and deadly as the AIDS epidemic came out of something so trivial as casual contacts between chimpanzees and humans. In their mind, such a big phenomenon needs to have bigger causes, such as evil scientists designing HIV to wipe out specific populations. Rob Brotherton (2013) neatly observes that there are countless conspiracy theories about JFK's assassination, but very few about Ronald Reagan's assassination attempt. The difference between both cases reflect this proportionality bias: inasmuch as in the first case the president was assassinated, big explanations are sought; in the second case, the president survived, so conspiracy theories about that event were soon left in oblivion. This is also the case with explanations for medical phenomena. In one particular study, Ebel-Lam et al. (2010) found that when subjects read about a disease outbreak that does not lead to deaths, they are less likely to believe that the outbreak was intended; by contrast, when another group of subjects read a story in which the outbreak does result in deaths, they are more likely to attribute it to a conspiracy. Piaget and Inhelder (2008) documented how children in preoperational stages rarely believe that accidents just happen. This suggests that, intuitively, we are intention seekers. In fact, Evelyn Rosset's (2008) empirical studies demonstrate that, subjects pressed with time, are more likely to explain things with greater intentionality bias, inasmuch as in shortness of time, intuition overtakes analytical thinking. Likewise, for conspiracy theorists, there are no accidents. In their mindset, bad things always come from bad agents. Many medical procedures may have minor unfortunate side effects, but conspiracy theorists have trouble understanding that these side effects are not necessarily intended.",

Unsurprisingly, we react quicker to snakes than to flowers, as has also been empirically documented (Ohman et al. 2001 ).

Thus, the capacity to detect alliances and figure out how outsiders get together against our own inner group, was a very important adaptation. As Tobby and Cosmides (2015) posit it, human brains are equipped with an \"alliance detection\" system. Consequently, conspiracy theories put this system in play: in their mental patterns, they bring together unrelated people, and conclude that they are forming an alliance behind closed doors, planning to harm a particular collective. For the most part, physicians are unrelated to politicians, but given that physicians are frequently perceived as a different group (and indeed, they are, given that they are professionally organized as such) in its own right, conspiracy theorists align them with the rest of outsiders, and imagine that they form coalitions to plot against patients.",

Officials have realized that, of all social media, Twitter in particular plays a huge role in the shaping of opinions and transmission of information, related to health issues (Denecke et al. 2013 ). Twitter has the particular advantage of conveying messages in a limited amount of words. From a cognitive science perspective, this proves very useful, because studies do show that shorter messages can have more powerful effects in brain processing (Saharia 2015) , especially if they pertain to emotional issues, as the case of medical conspiracy theories tends to be. Consequently, one important ethical implication from the cognitive science of medical conspiracy theories, is that, inasmuch as these theories rely on simplistic bites, one efficient way of combating misinformation might be by relying on similarly short information that debunks the false narratives circulating. For this endeavor, Twitter is ideal. One study has shown that misinformation and conspiracy mongering regarding the Zika virus effectively countered by Twitter (Wood 2018) .",

It is important to remember that, apart from the natural disposition towards gossiping, internet has potentiated the effects of rumor. This facilitates the spread of lies, but as Lidsky (2008) explains, the deliberate spread of false information cannot be protected as free speech. Although the internet has been an immensely valuable resource, communication ethicists now understand that more regulation is needed (Weiser 2009) , and this is an important aspect in addressing conspiracy mongering, particularly in the healthcare sector. Experts still debate whether internet has made conspiracy theories more prevalent; for now, there is no definite consensus, and it may still be too early to tell (Wood 2013 ). Yet, the internet is here to stay, and given that reality, public health officials must give more consideration to lobbying action to lawmakers and politicians, in order to call for a greater control of the information that is divulged in the cyberspace.",

Medical ethics in the past did not place much emphasis on the principle of autonomy, and paternalism was the rule. Things have changed over the last few decades, but physicians need to further ensure that patients retain the power of decision through informed consent. On a concrete level, this implies that public health officials emphasize to public health workers about the utmost importance of not imposing decisions on patients, and about the need to convey all the relevant information to them. Yet, we should keep in mind that in the current discussion, ethical imperatives can go beyond informed consent, given the different forms of public engagement. For example, O'Neill (2003) argues that \"since the point of consent procedures is to limit deception and coercion, they should be designed to give patients and others control over the amount of information they receive and opportunity to rescind consent already given.\"",

Furthermore, hospitals can arrange for weekly seminar series open to the wider public, in which particular social and political problems related to conspiracy theories claims are discussed (e.g., the price of medications, government healthcare plans, race representation in particular diseases), and seize the opportunity to hear attendees that may potentially be sympathetic to medical conspiracy theories, and engage them in dialogue.",
