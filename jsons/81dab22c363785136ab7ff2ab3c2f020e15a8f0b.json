Good assessment and consultation often start with a review of the existing medical chart and records. In this chapter, a practical method for extracting information from often complex, chaotic medical records is reviewed with particular emphasis on information relevant for neuropsychological evaluation (see also Lezak et al. 2004; Victor and Ropper 2001; Zaidat and Lerner 2008, for review) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 930, "end": 948, "text": "Lezak et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 949, "end": 972, "text": "Victor and Ropper 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 973, "end": 1008, "text": "Zaidat and Lerner 2008, for review)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Various state and federal guidelines mandate the prompt evaluation of an individual admitted to a hospital or longer-term health care facility.

This is usually in the form of a succinct sentence often or ideally in the patient's own words such as \"shortness of breath\" or \"change in mental status\" or \"admitted for elective cardiac surgery.\" The chief complaint encapsulates the reason for admission, at least on the initial basis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inpatient Chart"}, {"text": "1. History of present illness. This forms the main narrative of the admission history and physical and often starts with a brief review of past medical history. An example of this might be a \"Chief complaint of left-sided weakness\" followed by \"The patient is a 68-year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease admitted for left-sided weakness of 1 day's duration.\" The History of Present Illness often contains additional important information such as who provided the history; whether it was the patient or family or other medical personnel. It may also contain cross-references to other portions of the medical chart such as records obtained from the Emergency Medical Services. More importantly, one needs to scrutinize the History of Present Illness section for what it does not contain, such as important demographic information or vague statements that need to be considered in making one's own evaluation at a later date. 2. Past medical history. Typically, this is a listing of medical conditions, frequently abbreviated. Regulatory agencies such as JCAHO have rightly criticized the practice of abbreviations in medical charts as they can be confusing or ambiguous, and this may impact patient quality of care. Caution should be given in considering the source of medical history and confirming the list of critical past illnesses, as these can be in error and, if so, may lead to erroneous conclusions about contributing factors in the patient's current condition. For example, a patient with an erroneously reported history of Diabetes, Hypertension, or Coronary Artery Disease may be evaluated differently when presenting with stroke symptoms only to find out they have blood clots (phlebitis) after a long journey in a sedentary position. 3. Family and social history. Although this is usually a very truncated section of the history and physical, it is of importance in interpretation of any neuropsychological testing. This is one of the few sections that actually gives a sense of the person as living on a day-to-day basis. It will frequently contain information such as marital status or gender, tobacco, alcohol, and drug abuse. It may also contain information about the number of children, although in an inpatient setting this is often not specified. Of special importance is the patient's educational history and primary language (if specified), as many neuropsychological skills and test performances vary considerably with education, and consideration should be given to evaluate a patient in his/her primary language. For example, the same memory capacity would not be expected of someone with 4 years of education compared to someone with a graduate degree. If not a Fluent English speaker, performances and expectations should be altered. For practitioners who do not speak the language of the patient, options may include identifying another practitioner who does speak the language or finding an interpreter (caution should be taken if a family member or friend of the patient is used as this may Blood Pressure with systolic recorded over diastolic. In charting, these are often abbreviated as T, P, R, B/P, and often noted as numbers in that order. Caution is again warranted as the information provided here may have been copied from earlier in the chart (or another chart), such as the evaluation in the emergency room, and may not reflect information at the time of the writing of the admission History and Physical. It is also not uncommon in a busy inpatient hospital setting for the actual writing of the admission History and Physical to be delayed for several hours following the actual examination.

Again, cross-reference with the history as described above is often useful. Gross vision problems may be noted here (or in CN exam section), including strabismus, exotropia, esotropia, or ambylopia. Strabismus is the lack of muscle co-ordination between the eyes. Exotropia refers to an eye being deviated away from midline (deviated outward), and is a form of strabismus. Esotropia refers to an eye being deviated towards the midline (deviated inward), and is a form of strabismus.

Cranial nerves. These are often summarized as \"CN II-XII intact.\" Cranial nerve I (olfactory nerve) is generally not tested. As with mental status, it is not always clear when this is a cursory evaluation versus a summation of a detailed examination. See Chap. 3 for review of anatomy of Cranial Nerves, and Chap. 4 for list of the Cranial Nerves and methods for assessment. Neurologists will often group cranial nerves into functional clusters including smell, taste, vision and eye movement, hearing, swallowing, and facial and neck strength and sensation. Sometimes, one will see \"CN I-XII were intact (or WNL),\" indicating sense of smell was evaluated. However, a more detailed exam will provide clear indication how the CN's were tested (e.g., \"each nostril tested separately, and pt. able to identify several common scents.\"). Motor examination.

A variety of terms may be used to describe when it is present, but the most common will be action tremor (including postural, kinetic, physiological, and intention tremors) or resting tremor (classically, Parkinsonian tremor). Among action tremors, the most common clinically diagnosed type is essential tremor (ET), which is a tremor of 4-8 Hz most predominant when a static limb posture is maintained, but may also be evident when moving (intention tremor). Classically, it affects the upper limbs bilaterally, but may present worse in one limb (typically dominant hand). It may also involve the head, termed titubation, with a nodding type of movement. Involvement can include jaw, lips, and larynx, such that the patient's voice has a quavering quality. It is uncommon for lower extremities to be markedly affected by ET. It can progress to be disabling, making writing illegible and preventing a patient from holding a cup of water to drink (see also Chap. 19, this volume, for further review of ET and other movement disorders). Physiological tremor is present in all normal individuals, and is of high frequency (8-13 Hz) and low amplitude such that it is not seen by the naked eye nor appreciated by most people. When exaggerated, termed Enhanced Physiological tremor, by fright, anxiety, extreme exertion, withdraw from alcohol, toxic effects from some chemicals (caffeine, lithium, etc.) or metabolic dysfunction (e.g., hyperthyroidism or hypoglycemia), the physiological tremor increases to be seen and to disrupt routine activities. Enhanced physiological tremor can appear like ET, and is most easily appreciated when holding arms out with fingers outstretched. Intention tremor refers to a tremor distinguished from other action or postural tremor by its form and associated features. Intention tremor is absent at rest and the initial start of a movement. However, as increasingly fine movement is needed for an act (i.e., picking up a full cup of water), the tremor becomes present with a sideways oscillation at about 2-4 Hz of increasingly large amplitude that often continues after the target is reached. Intention tremor is always associated with cerebellar ataxia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 213, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Fig. 2.2 Illustration of the Plantar (Babinski) reflex"}, {"text": "Other abnormal movements, such as chorea, athetosis, dystonias, ballismus (often hemiballismus) or akinesia, are often noted here. Choreiform movements may involve the proximal or distal muscles and are involuntary, excessive, jerky, irregularly timed, and randomly distributed. These movements can vary from subtle (appearing as \"restlessness\" to unstable dance-like gait while walking), to more severe (disabling flow of continuous extreme and violent movements). They are frequently associated with basal ganglia diseases. Athetosis describes slow writhing-like movements that are slower than choreiform movements, but may be described as \"slow choreiform movements.\" Choreoathetosis is an \"intermediate\" form of choreiform movements. Ballismus describes an extreme of choreiform movement in which motor movements are rapid and include violent flinging movements. It typically involves an involuntary, continuous, uncoordinated movement involving proximal and distal muscle groups resulting in a limb being \"flung out.\" It typically involves one side of the body, termed hemiballismus, but bilateral paraballismus has been reported.

Examples include ideomotor and ideational apraxia. Ataxia refers to inability to coordinate muscle movements that is not due to motor weakness. Muscle movements will appear clumsy or \"jerky.\" Ataxia is typically associated with lesions to the cerebellum leading to gait abnormalities (see below), but may also occur due to sensory ataxia from damage to proprioception sensory pathways. Optic ataxia is the inability to coordinate eye-hand motor movements and is observed with Balint's syndrome (see Chap. 9, this volume).

Dysmetria is abnormal movements associated with cerebellar damage, and involves dysfunction in the ability to accurately control the range of movement needed for a muscular action. Dysmetria is commonly tested with finger-to-nose testing. The individual with dysmetria will be unable to guide his/her finger to the examiners finger or nose, in which the target is under-or overshot, with attempts at corrections which have a 'jerky' quality and overcorrection is often present.
