Plasmodium infection may result in severe malaria in patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium knowlesi, which can develop malaria-associated acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) and often results in morbidity and mortality. ALI or ARDS is with mortality rates of approximately 80 % (Taylor et al. 2012; White et al. 2013), accompanied by pulmonary edema (Taylor et al. 2006). Malaria-associated ALI/ARDS is thought to be due, in part, to increased alveolar permeability, parasite sequestration, and host immune response; however, the mechanisms behind it are largely unknown (Mohan et al. 2008).",

Galectins are a family of highly conserved glycan-binding proteins that play an important role in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Rabinovich and Toscano 2009). Galectin-9 (Gal-9) down-regulates T helper (Th)1 and Th17 responses and is involved in the suppression mediated by CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells, mainly through interaction with the Th1-specific cell surface molecule TIM-3 (Seki et al. 2008; Chou et al. 2009). The Gal-9/Tim-3 interaction acts as a specific inhibitor of Th1 and Th17 immune responses (Lu et al. 2015). Although the participation of lungs involved in the severity of malaria has been well documented (Boulos et al. 1993; Taylor et al. 2006; Rojo-Marcos et al. 2008), knowledge about this pathogenesis is still limited. The mechanisms through which infection with Plasmodium spp. result in lung disease are largely unknown.",

To score lung inflammation and damage, the lung pathology was semiquantitatively scored as described previously (Knapp et al. 2004) with minor modification. In brief, the following parameters were analyzed: interstitial inflammation, intra-alveolar inflammation, bronchitis, alveolar edema, endothelialitis, and thrombi formation. Each parameter was graded on a scale from 0 to 3 as follows: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe.

Accumulating evidence indicates that galectins fall into the category of immune regulatory molecules. Gal-9 ameliorates respiratory syncytial virus-induced pulmonary immunopathology through regulating the balance between Th17 and regulatory T cells (Lu et al. 2015). Gal-9 exerts its pivotal immunomodulatory effects by inducing apoptosis or suppressing effector functions via engagement with its receptor, Tim-3. Interaction of soluble Gal-9 with Tim-3 expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ T cells renders them less susceptible to HIV-1 infection, while enhanced HIV infection occurs when Gal-9 interacts with a different receptor than Tim-3, indicating the versatile role of Gal-9 in viral pathogenesis (Merani et al. 2015). In addition, the plasma levels of Gal-9 appear to track dengue virus inflammatory responses and may serve as an important novel biomarker of acute dengue virus infection and disease severity (Chagan-Yasutan et al. 2013). In this study, we demonstrated that PbANKA infection induces the upregulation of Gal-9 and Tim-3 expressions in the lungs and MLNs.",

            "text": "Immunologic mechanisms are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria-induced ALI, and the study of cells and molecules with immunoregulatory activity has begun to gain importance in recent years. Studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory properties of \u03b2-galactoside-binding protein, Gal-9, and its receptor Tim-3 in parasitic diseases (Katoh et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2014). Gal-9 can be highly modulatory for immune function depending on the circumstance (Wiersma et al. 2013), and some of this activity is mediated by the inhibitory molecule Tim-3 (Zhu et al. 2005). Although data about the role of Gal-9/TIM-3 pathway in the pathogenesis of human diseases is emerging, research about their role during malaria is scarce. In the present study, by using immunohistochemical technique, we found that the numbers of Tim-3+ and Gal-9+ cells in the lungs and MLNs of PbANKA-infected mice were significantly increased at all the times in comparison of uninfected controls; at the same time, the mRNA levels of Tim-3 and Gal-9 were significantly increased in the lungs and MLNs after infection. It has been reported that Tim-3 binding to Gal-9 stimulates anti-microbial immunity (Jayaraman et al. 2010). Administration of exogenous reGal-9 significantly ameliorates hepatocellular damage caused by liver ischemia and reperfusion injury in mice, which may be a new therapeutic strategy against innate immunity-dominated liver tissue damage (Hirao et al. 2015). In addition, our data showed that pro-inflammatory (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were over-expressed in the lungs, and IL-6 and IL-10 were over-expressed in the MLNs after PbANKA infection. IL-10 is originally released by Th2 cells but now is found to be produced by other types of cells as well including B cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells (O\u2019Garra and Vieira 2007). The activation of the immune system by antigens released by P. falciparum plays an important role in the induction and worsening of lung damage (Boulos et al. 1993). CD36 and Fyn kinase are critical mediators of malaria-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction in mice infected with PbANKA (Anidi et al. 2013). Therefore, although the actual regulatory mechanisms for the control of cell surface Gal-9 and Tim-3 were unknown, the increase of Gal-9+ and Tim-3+ cells as well as the enhancement of Gal-9 and Tim-3 expressions in PbANKA-induced ALI, which may play an important role in the development of ALI in murine malaria.",
