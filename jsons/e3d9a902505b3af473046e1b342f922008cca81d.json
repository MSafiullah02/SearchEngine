The scientific study of the genus Calophyllum revealed that it is a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites. These phytochemicals have shown a wide range of biological activities. Some of these have reached to the clinical developmental stage. The Calophyllum inophyllum seed oil has been proved to be an acceptable sustainable source of biodiesel. Few species of the genus are endangered and have been included in the red list of threatened species by the IUCN Red List. Owing to the importance of the genus a review of its ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology has been carried out. It will further help to explore the molecular mechanism of phytochemicals for health benefits.",

Antimalarial drugs such as artemisinin and quinine and anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel and vinblastine are some of the wellknown natural products which are used for the effective treatment of the disease. The major problem associated with the natural products is poor bioavailability and limited yield. These problems are being overcome by medicinal chemists by synthesizing the natural products in good yield and by preparing their analogues with good bioavailability. The genus Calophyllum has also proved to be a potential source of lead compounds for the drug discovery and development. Calanolide A, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor isolated from the genus, is being evaluated under clinical trial. The genus is a rich source of several medicinally active compounds falling under various chemical classes. The genus includes 190 species and is classified under Calophyllaceae family. The species of the genus are identified with various distinguishing characters like red-coloured outer bark and drupe fruit. The species of the genus such as Calophyllum inophyllum is also known to be used traditionally to alleviate disease and is used in the management of leprosy. Owing to the medicinal importance of the genus Calophyllum, this chapter presents a review of its ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology.",

Now, the APG III (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group) system of flowering plant classification classifies it under Calophyllaceae family. There are 190 species in the genus, of which 179 were identified in the Old World (Africa, Asia and Europe) and only 10 species in the New World (the Americas and Oceania) (Eckenwalder 1980) . These species are distributed mainly from eastern Africa to the Pacific in the Old World (Stevens 1980) . The multivariate analysis by Diaz et al. showed that other American species of the genus Calophyllum are originated from this taxon (D\u00edaz 2013) . The species in genus Calophyllum are difficult to classify due to the challenge of establishing distinct boundaries (Watt 2014) .",

The habitat of the species ranges from wet tropical rainforest of the lowlands to drier areas at higher altitudes. Some of the species are also found in flooded areas. The genus has several distinguishing taxonomical characteristics like red-coloured outer bark with diamond-shaped fissures and presence of opposite leaves with closely and alternating parallel veins. Other characteristics of the species include axillary, terminal and raceme inflorescences. The fruits of the genus Calophyllum are drupe possessing very thin layers of flesh along with a large seed. The sepals and petals in the genus are arranged in hermaphrodite flowers. These also secrete latex which is yellow or white in colour (Eckenwalder 1980) . Several species of the genus such as C. apetalum, C. bracteatum, C. caudatum, C. cordato-oblongum and C. mooni have been included in the red list of threatened species by the IUCN RedList. Furthermore, 18 species are categorized as vulnerable (viz. C. apetalum, C. caudatum, C. cordato-oblongum), 5 species as endangered (viz. C. insularum, C. morobense, C. nubicola, C. trapezifolium and C. waliense) and 3 species as critically endangered (viz. C. acutiputamen, C. africanum and C. cuneifolium) (Stevens 1980 ).",

Root decoction of C. inophyllum is used locally in the treatment of ulcers and the leaf decoction is used in the treatment of eye infections (10).

(1993) isolated two tetracyclic dipyranocoumarins, i.e. calophyllic acid (7) and isocalophyllic acid (8), from the leaves of C. inophyllum. Similarly, recedesolide (9), a tricyclic pyranocoumarin, was isolated from C. blancoi (Shen et al. 2004 ). Shen et al. (2003) isolated inocalophyllin A (10) and B (12) along with their methyl esters (11and 13, respectively) from the seeds of C. inophyllum. Furthermore, Yasunaka et al. (2005) ",

These xanthones differ in structure by oxygenation pattern and position of isoprenyl group in the xanthone nucleus. Xanthones are also substituted with various other functionalities like OH, OMe, OCOMe, 3-carboxybutyl, 1,1-dimethylprop-2enyloxy, 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl and 4-hydroxy-3methylbut-2-enyl and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl. Guanidine (39), a 1,5-dihydroxy-6-(3,3-dimethylbut-2-enyl)-1,5-dihydroxy xanthone, was isolated from the timber of C. walker (Dahanayake et al. 1974) . Apetalinone A (40) was isolated from C. apetalum. Apetalinone A bears 1,1-dimethylprop-2-enyloxy ether substitution which suggested that its biosynthesis involves Claisen rearrangement and Diels-Alder reaction (Iinuma et al. 1997) . Acetylblancoxanthone (41), caloxanthone A (42), caloxanthone C (43), jacareubin (44), 6-deoxyjacareubin (45), dombakinaxanthone (46) and osajaxanthone (47) are pyranoxanthones possessing a pyran ring at C5-C6, C6-C7 or C7-C8 isolated from the Calophyllum spp. (Dharmaratne and Wijesinghe 1997; Yimdjo et al. 2004; Shen et al. 2005; Taher et al. 2005; Mah et al. 2015) . Dombakinaxanthone (46), a trioxygenated diprenylated chromen-xanthone, and calozeyloxanthone (48) were also isolated from C. moonii. (Dharmaratne and Wijesinghe 1997) . Furthermore, caloxanthone (49) and pyranojacaeubin (50) possess two pyran rings. Caloxanthone G (51) possesses 2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydropyrane ring while caloxanthone B (52) possesses a furan ring. Gunasekera et al. (1977) isolated three xanthones calabaxanthone (53), trapezifolixanthone (54) and 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)xanthone (55) from the bark of C. cuneifolium. Similarly, brasixanthone B (56) was isolated from the stem bark of C. inophyllum (Mah et al. 2015) (Fig. 5.1; Table 5 .2).",

Studies on its mechanism of action showed that these compounds inhibit reverse transcriptase enzyme and are classified as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Creagh et al. 2001) . Researchers from the National Cancer Institute studied anticancer potential of Malaysian trees in Sarawak's forest. Unfortunately, they did not get any anticancer compound; instead they found an anti-HIV compound calanolide A from leaves and twigs of C. lanigerum. The isolated compound calanolide A showed complete protection against HIV-1 replication, with an IC 50 of 5.9 AE 1.9 \u03bcM. The relocation efforts of the tree were failed and percentage of calanolide A was very less in other species of the genus Calophyllum. Further research showed that calanolide B, an isomer of calanolide A, is slightly less active. Calanolide B has the advantage of being readily available from the latex without causing any harm to the trees (Kashman et al. 1992 11-Demethyl-12-oxo, an analogue of calanolide A, possesses comparable in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and is used as a template to study structure-activity relationship of other congeners (Hanna 1999) . Inophyllums such as inophyllum B and P, isolated from C. inophyllum, displayed activity against HIV with an IC 50 value of 38 nM and 130 nM, respectively (Patil et al. 1993) . Similarly, cordatolides A and B isolated from C. cordato-oblongum showed anti-HIV activity with an IC 50 value of 12.3 nM and 19 \u03bcM, respectively. Five pyranoxanthones isolated from C. blancoi also showed activity against the coronavirus with EC 50 of 3-15 \u03bcg/ml (Shen et al. 2005) (Table 5 .3).",

Calanolide A, isolated from the genus Calophyllum, has shown potential anti-HIV activity and continues to be in the clinical developmental stage. The dependence of calanolide A availability on isolation from the natural source has posed a problem in its further development. Various synthetic routes and alternative sources of the compounds with better yields are being explored to overcome this problem. Further studies to explore the molecular mechanism of the phytochemicals need to be done to exploit it for health benefits.",
