We begin by giving all topological structures of possible phylogenetic trees for the sequences. For each of these trees, we let the informative positions be the leaf nodes, and we then predict their parent nodes based on the information of the leaf nodes, as well as giving the statistics of the differences between nucleotides within the neighbor nodes and computing the sum of the difference of nucleotides on the whole tree, which is called the length of the tree. We choose the tree with the minimum length as the estimation of the phylogenetic tree. For the above example, these four sequences may result in three possible trees without Fig. 6 .3a-c. Using the maximal parsimony method to construct phylogenetic tree. a The topological structure of the first tree, whose length is 4. b The topological structure of the second tree, whose length is 5. c The topological structure of the third tree, whose length is 6 a root as shown as Fig. 6. 3. For every possible tree, we compute the number of substitutions at the informative positions. We find the lengths of the three trees to be 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Therefore, we choose the tree in Fig. 6 .3a as the estimation of the phylogenetic tree.",

The sum of the substitution times is the length of the tree. We have outlined the process of constructing a phylogenetic tree using the maximum parsimony method. However, there remain some questions to be answered. First, if the number of species is too large, then the topological structures of the phylogenetic tree will generally be too high in number. For example, in trees with roots, when the number of species is n \u2265 2, the number of trees with roots is N R = (2n\u22123)! 2 n\u22122 (n\u22122)! . Therefore, the number increases exponentially. Typically, the number of trees with roots is about 3.4 \u00d7 10 7 if n = 10; and the number of trees with roots is about 8.2 \u00d7 10 21 if n = 20. This number is too large to compute the minimum length of a tree. Therefore, we must attempt to decrease the search times. For example, the branch and bound algorithm ensures a minimum length tree will be found. However, the time complexity of the algorithm is close to that of an exhaustive search algorithm in the worst case scenario. It is a time-consuming method. Heuristic search algorithms are another option. They highly reduce the search times but do not ensure the optimal solution will be found. Therefore, we consider using exhaustive search algorithms or the branch and bound algorithm only as long as the number of species is not excessive. It may be worth using heuristic search algorithms if the number of species is high. In addition, repeating this algorithm as the order of species changes will be helpful towards improving the quality of the result.",

However, in most cases, the molecular clock supposition does not hold. The evolution speeds are different as the position is changed. That is, at different positions, the same branch length may not represent the same evolution time or the same substitution numbers. Therefore, \u03bb is connected with the positions. As a result, Yang [108] proved that the distribution of \u03bb is approximated by a \u0393 distribution.

This model is superior to others. Especially in simulation research, this method is better than feature-based methods and distance-based methods. In different regions, we can choose different instantaneous transition probability matrixes. For example, in the region that code a protein, we may use the substitution model of a codon to construct the phylogenetic tree [34], while maximum likelihood methods would be timeconsuming.

For the same biosome, there are many methods to collect the data sample, and for different data samples we may get different results. Therefore, we should analyze the biological meaning from several different angles.Using the above general procedure, we next discuss several examples in biology and medicine. We will detail the content involved within the discussions.",

Based on the penalty matrix, we find the system clustering tree as shown in Fig. 6 .8. 4. When the SARS virus of Pagumalarvata infects human beings, the mutations of the genome consist of three parts: the first part is the mutation differences (i.e., H ag , H bg ) of different Pagumalarvatas; the second part is the mutation differences (i.e., H hf , H hc ) of different human beings; and the third part is the common mutation differences (i.e., H gh ) of human beings and Pagumalarvatas. We believe that the particular mutation H gh is the key to how Pagumalarvata infects human beings. The mutation mode is shown in Table 6 .4.",

After the SARS virus of Pagumalarvata infected human beings, many cases emerged. However, the SARS disease may break out only if the HZS2-E(e) virus occurs. Therefore, the mutation H fe is the key to a SARS outbreak. The mutation modes are as shown in Table 6 .5.Remark 10. The data in Table 6 .5 are defined the same way as those in Table 6.4. Remark 11.
