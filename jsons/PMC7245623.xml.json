            "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)are kinds of stem cells that play an important role in regeneration and restoration because of its multi-lineage differentiative capacity. They have the potential to differentiate to form connective tissues, skeletal muscle cells, and cells of the vascular system [1]. MSCs are developed from the mesodermal germ layer, which is one of the three layers in the inner mass cell [2]. There are a large number of MSCs in the parts of human bodies with high regeneration and differentiation capacity,such as bone marrow, embryo. Besides, the human umbilical cord and adipose tissue are also important origins of MSC for researches. The above four sources are the main sources of MSC researches and are also the main kinds we are going to introduce in this review. In addition to this, there are some rare sources of MSCs, including menstrual blood-derived MSCs [3, 4] and dental MSCs [5]. What they secreted have characteristics of MSCs and the potential for treatments of related diseases. Moreover, it has been discovered that MSCs also played an important role in immune regulation and might be a mediator of inflammation. The signals of inflammation activate MSCs to differentiate proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotype and MSCs can also affect the polarization of monocytes and control pathogenic T cell responses [6, 7]. More recently, it was reported that MSCs transplanted into human bodies for treatments and received good effects. Thus, A new treatment called cell-therapy has emerged and developed [8]. Although MSCs transplantation seems to have a promising prospect for development, most clinical trials remained in phase I or II. And clinical trial failures of autologous and allogeneic MSC products have been frequent. There are even reports about the risk of tumorigenicity and cell death resulted from the transplantation of MSCs [9].",

            "text": "It has been shown that the therapeutic functions of MSCs mediated partly through paracrine effects. The various bioactive molecules that MSCs secreted can modulate immune, inhibit apoptosis and fibrosis, promote angiogenesis and the growth of stem and progenitor cells [10]. Some of them are mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), which were a series of vesicles secreted by MSCs (Fig. 1). EVs are cell-derived membranous structures that originate from the endosomal system or which are shed from the plasma membrane [11]. EVs are not a homogeneous system, including exosomes, shedding vesicles, apoptotic bodies, melanosomes, and prostasomes range from 10 to 1000 nm [12, 13]. Most researches mainly focused on exosomes and microvesicles (MVs). MVs are vesicles of which the particle size is > 200 nm, budding directly from the plasma membrane [14]. Exosomes have the smaller particle size that ranges from 50 nm to 200 nm, for they are formed through the invagination of the early endosome [15]. Unlike microvesicles, exosomes are cup-like vesicles with CD81, CD9, and Alix as their biomarkers, due to the different mechanisms of secretion [1, 16]. Exosomes also have some special biological characteristics and processes. Apart from those proteins that serve as biomarkers, exosomes also carry many functional cytokines and growth factors, regulatory RNAs and so on [15]. The release of exosomes is also a special process. It involves some proteins, such as the ESCRT [17]. The function of exosomes that attract much attention. In the beginning, exosomes were regarded as metabolic waste [18]. With more and more studies of exosomes, the functions of signal transmission and cell-to-cell communication were discovered [19]. On the one hand, they appear similar functions of MSCs and is expected to become the alternatives to cell therapies. On the other hand, it has been discovered that exosomes might influence the tumor microenvironment, but the mechanism remained unknown [20]. Thus, exosomes have the potential to treat cancers by changing the microenvironment of tumors.",

At the same time, they have the advantages of good stability. Not only that, but EVs can also be used as a vehicle to deliver bioactive factors.

And it is also a conventional way to obtain the MSCs-EVs, which is to harvest bone marrow from adult rats or humans [23, 24]. For extracellular vesicles from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs), the most common diseases treated are cartilage defects or osteoarthritis which are related to bone diseases [25] [26]. The reason is that the bone marrow source has the bone targeting ability [27] and can also induce osteogenic differentiation similar to its parent cells [28, 29]. In a study of osteoarthritis, EVs from hBM-MSCs can promote extracorporeal cartilage regeneration because EVs stimulated chondrocytes to produce proteoglycans and type II collagen. Also, those EVs inhibit the adverse effects of inflammatory mediators on cartilage homeostasis. These anti-inflammatory effects were mediated by inhibiting TNF-alpha-mediated upregulation of COX2 and pro-inflammatory interleukins [26]. Since the bone marrow from which hMSC comes is connective tissue, the EVs they secreted were discovered to have a therapeutic effect on other connective tissue such as tendon. Topical administration of MSC-EVs promotes tendon healing by inhibiting the accumulation of inflammatory and apoptotic cells and increasing the proportion of tendon resident stem cells/progenitor cells [30].",

Systemic infusion of hBM-MSCs EVs could prolong the survival time of aGVHD mice and reduce pathological damage of various GVHD-targeted organs. This was due to the immunosuppressive effect of hBM-MSCs derived extracellular vesicles. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were inhibited in EV-treated GVHD mice. While inhibiting the functional differentiation of T cells from naive to effector type, EVs derived from BM-MSCs also retained the CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cell (Tregs) population [35]. EVs can significantly reduce the risk of cell transplantation while retaining the similar efficacy of BM-MSCs. In another study about the immunoregulatory effects of hBM-MSCs EVs, they induced the apoptosis of CD3 + cells and of the CD4 + subpopulation and increased the proliferation and the apoptosis of Tregs. In addition, EVs treatment increased the Treg/Teff ratio and the concentration of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. These results suggest EVs have an immunomodulatory effect on T cells in vitro, but this is not related to IDO, which is an established mediator of MSC immunosuppressive effects [36].",

In some studies, researchers investigated the potential mechanisms of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes (hBM-MSCs-Ex) in the treatment of liver fibrosis and found the therapeutic effect of exosomes on hepatic fibrosis was significantly greater than that of hBM-MSCs [41]. Moreover, recent studies have discovered that exosomes are the main mediators of MSC therapy in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the previous study, transplanting human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into the lateral ventricle of BTBR mice can improve their autistic phenotype for a long time. However, the nasal administration of MSC exosomes to BTBR mice can significantly improve autistic behavior that increased social interaction and reduced repetitive behaviors. This treatment can avoid the risk of rejection and infection associated with the transplant [42]. The exosomes, which are small size vesicles with strong permeability, are also very suitable for nasal administration. In addition, the role of hBM-MSCs-Ex in immunotherapy should not be ignored. Apart from inducing polarization of M2 macrophages, it also regulated the maturation, proliferation, and activation of lymphocytes. For example, the exosomes regulated the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes and affected the function of B lymphocytes by regulating the differential expression of related mRNAs [43].",

In a study of wound healing, hBM-MSCs exosomes mainly regulated the polarization of macrophages by targeting pknox1 with mir-223 in exosomes [44]. However,in another study of heart attacks, LPS-primed mouse BMSC-derived exosomes had a good therapeutic effect on polarized M2 macrophages in vitro and reduce inflammation and myocardial cell apoptosis after infarction [45]. Similar to macrophage polarization, recent studies found that mouse BMSC-derived exosomes can regulate microglia polarization. The exosomes reduced inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system in EAE rat models by increasing microglial cell M2 polarization [46]. In some studies of myocardial infarction, BMSC-derived exosomes showed therapeutic potential in improving myocardial function. GATA-4 is a cardiomyocyte-specific zinc finger transcription factor that regulates differentiation, growth, and survival. GATA-4-expressing BMSCs improve functional recovery than that observed for BMSCs alone when injected into the myocardium immediately after induction of ischemia. It was found that GATA-4-expressing mBM-MSCs exosomes can induce MSCs to differentiate into precursor cells of cardiomyocytes, reduce apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction [47]. Additionally, they significantly reduced the apoptosis rate of cardiac stem cells (CSCs) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after oxidative stress injury. And exosomes of hypoxic-cultured BM-MSCs were more potent than exosomes of normal cultured MSCs. Further researches showed that mir-214 is the main effector molecule in exosomes of BM-MSCs that protects CSCs from oxidative damage. BMSCs inhibited oxidative stress damage in CSCs by silencing the release of mir-214-containing exosomes by CaMKII [48]. Another study explains this phenomenon from another angle. Hypoxia culture enhanced the activity of mir-210 and nSMase2 in MSC and its secreted exosomes, which are important to the secretory pathway of exosomes [49].",

In a study of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, researchers found that miR-199a-3p enriched in hBMSC-Exos and down-regulate Sema3A expression, thereby activating the AKT and ERK pathways when delivering to renal cells by exosomes [52]. Mir -199a-5p was another microRNA that has been showed to protect renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. It is transferred to renal tubular epithelial cells (nrk-52e) in a time-dependent manner and significantly inhibits I/r-induced er stress by targeting immunoglobulin (BIP) [53]. Besides, other microRNAs that BMSCs-Exo contained related to other functions have also been studied. For example, the release of exosomes from BM-MSCs in elderly mice can be absorbed by fat cells, muscle cells and liver cells, resulting in insulin resistance in vivo and in vitro, which was related to miR-29b-3p.

However, there is growing evidence that EVs from mesenchymal stem cells may contribute to these effects and are considered a potential alternative to stem-based therapies. By exploring the effect and mechanism of hepatic ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury (IRI), it has been revealed that human umbilical cord MSCs-EVs (huc-MSCs-EVs) can reduce the infiltration of neutrophils and reduce the oxidative stress of liver tissue in vivo, so as to protect the liver cell apoptosis induced by IRI to some extent. Further studies showed that the mechanism that EVs reduces oxidative stress is that the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) which has anti-apoptosis and anti-oxidation ability is encapsulated in the huc-MSCs-EVs [58]. In addition, huc-MSCs-EVs are proved to promote functional recovery and nerve regeneration in a study of peripheral nerve injury. It promotes the recovery of motor function and the regeneration of axon and reduced gastrocnemius atrophy [59]. Moreover, huc-MSCs-EVs ameliorated bone loss in senile osteoporotic mice. Results showed that the EVs can promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and inhibit osteoclast formation of RAW264.7 cells. Meanwhile, miR-3960 mediates the osteogenesis of BMSCs by huc-MSCs-EVs [60]. At present, it has been reported that EVs ameliorates induced intrauterine adhesions with the combination of estrogen. Whether EVs were administrated alone or in combination with estrogen showed a significant reduction in inflammation and fibrosis. And the combination of EVs and estrogen showed the best therapeutic effect. Therefore, the synergistic effect of huc-MSCs-EVs and estrogen can provide a new strategy for the future clinical combination of drugs [61].",

Studies have discovered that Wharton-Jelly MSCs derived EVs had therapeutic effects in renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, which effect is like Wharton-Jelly MSCs [63, 64]. The study reported EVs released from WJMSCs (WJMSC-EVs) can suppress oxidation by enhancing Nrf2/ARE activation [63]. The microvesicles (hWJMSC-MVs) can enhance the proliferation and alleviate the apoptosis of renal cells. Further research showed that they also reduced the macrophages and inhibit inflammation by down-regulating CX3CL1 [64]. Another research also showed this immune function in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia [65]. Besides, they have neuron protective effects in perinatal brain injury through anti-inflammation [66, 67].

Their therapeutic effect on these diseases is related to the function of promoting angiogenesis and reducing apoptosis. For example, Li et al. reported that exosomes derived from UC-MSC (UC-MSC-Ex) can reduce hepatic inflammation and collagen deposition in liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) [72]. Jiang et al. and Yan et al. further discovered that UC-MSC-Ex has the function of decreasing oxidative stress and apoptosis in CCl4-Induced Liver Injury [73, 74]. At present, researchers have developed functional peptide hydrogel coated exosomes that derived from Huc-MSCs to promote heart repair. The peptide PA-GHRPS can protect H9C2 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative stress. And PGN hydrogel mixed with it and another peptide can effectively encapsulate exosomes, ensuring the stability and continuous release of exosomes. The results showed that the functional exosomes reduced inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis, promoted angiogenesis and improved myocardial function [75]. HuC-MSC- Ex have a unique application for perinatal diseases and neonates. A study of perinatal brain injury showed that intranasally administered exosomes played a neuroprotective role in the injury. They induced a significant reduction in specific neuron cell death and promoted damaged normal myelin formation [76]. Another study showed that they can reduce nerve inflammation, as they block the degradation and proliferation of the NF\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 in response to the stimulation of phosphorylated protein kinase family of molecules LPS [66]. In a study of preterm newborn infants, researchers found that Huc-MSCs-Ex from term newborn infants had an aerobic respiration capacity independent of the entire mitochondria. And there were functional differences between term exosomes and preterm exosomes that preterm exosomes are unable to synthesize ATP. This indicated that premature babies are less able to repair damaged tissue and more able to cope with hypoxia [77]. Additionally, HuC-MSC- Ex had therapeutic effects on ovarian granulosa cell (OGC) apoptosis induced by cisplatin chemotherapy. The exosomes were successfully uptake by OGC and increased the number of living cells. Further evidence suggested that Bcl-2 and caspase-3 expressions are up-regulated, and the expressions of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP are down-regulated, indicating the protective effect of exosomes on cells [78].",

For example, it was found that miR-146a which was an anti-inflammatory miRNA, was strongly upregulated in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated Huc-MSCs and was enriched in exosomes. The exosome containing mir-146a was successfully uptake by fibroblasts. And it inhibited fibroblast activation and associated inflammatory responses, which may result in inhibiting urethral stricture [80]. Another research reported that the mir-146a enriched exosomes had a good effect on sepsis. The mir-146a was transferred to macrophages by huc-MSCs-Ex, resulted in M2 polarization. The increased survival in septic mice further demonstrated the efficacy of this exosome. Different from the former, the way to obtain such exosomes was pretreated Huc-MSCs with pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) [81]. Moreover, in a study on treating burns, Mir-181c in huc-MSCs-Ex plays a key role in regulating inflammation. They suppressed the increase of levels of tumor necrosis factor cytokines \u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and upregulated levels of iL-10. And the over-expression of mir-181c huc-MSCs exosomes can more effectively inhibit the TLR4 signaling pathway and reduce the inflammatory response in burned rats [82]. In addition to promoting wound healing, the research has been done on whether mesenchymal stem cells promote scar formation. The results showed that Huc-MSCs reduced scarring and myofibroblast accumulation in mouse models with skin defects by huc-MSCs-Ex. High throughput RNA sequence and functional analysis revealed that specific microRNAs (Mir-21, -23a, -125b, -145) in exosomes play a key role in inhibiting myofibroblast aggregation which related to factor-\u03b22/SMAD2 pathway [83]. Furthermore, huc-MSCs-Ex contained special protein involved in the protective effect. In previous studies, huc-MSCs-Ex were observed to have antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects and were rescued from liver failure. A recent study revealed that glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) contained in huc-MSCs-Ex, which detoxifies CCl and HO, can reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therefore, huc-MSCs-ex promotes the recovery of liver oxidative injury by delivering GPX1 [74].",

Most of the functions of hAD-MSCs EVs were basically the same as those of the other two sources, such as tissue repair, reduction of injuries and anti-inflammation. Many studies have further investigated the mechanism by which EVs regulates inflammation in various disease models. In studies of osteoarthritis, EVs from AD-MSCs stimulated with interleukin- (IL-) 1\u03b2 reduced the production of inflammatory mediators IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 significantly [84]. In another study, it was discovered that AD-MSCs reduced the levels of other inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, prostaglandin E2 and NO. And the downregulation of prostaglandin E2 was caused by the reduction of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1. Besides, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was upregulated, which also indicated that AD-MSCs EVs have anti-inflammatory effects [85]. Further research also showed that MMP3 was downregulated and CCL2 and CCL5 returned at pre-inflammation basal levels. CXCL8 showed significant contractions, suggesting that EVs regulates inflammation through the CREB pathway. In summary, AD-MSCs EVs decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the chronic FLS inflammatory model [86]. Moreover, AD-MSCs EVs down-regulated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and the accumulation of \u03b3H2AX foci which was associated with senescence. Meanwhile, they also controlled the alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the level of oxidative stress [84]. The anti-inflammatory effects of AD-MSCs EVs were also found in allergic asthma, with the reduction of IL-5 levels in lung tissue. However, AD-MSCs or EVs had different effects on eosinophil cell counts, levels of IL-4, IL-13, and eotaxin in lung tissue, indicating that the mechanism of anti-inflammation might be different [87].",

In a study of atopic dermatitis, AD-MSCs exosomes significantly reduced mRNA expression of various inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-23, IL-31, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in atopic dermatitis skin lesions of the mouse model [91]. The decreased inflammatory factors overlapped with those of exosomes from other sources. AD-MSCs exosomes can also modulate the polarization of macrophages by delivering miRNAs [92]. In the aspect of wound healing, AD-MSCs exosomes were absorbed and internalized by fibroblasts and increased gene expression of N-cadherin, cyclin-1, PCNA and collagen I, III. Further research found that in the early stage of wound healing, systemic administration of AD-MSCs exosomes can increase the production of type I and type III collagen. However, at the late stage of wound healing, exosomes may inhibit collagen expression to reduce scar formation [93]. Another study pointed out that AD-MSCs exosomes reduced scar formation by adjusting the ratio of collagen type III and type I [94]. At present, engineering bioactive antibacterial exosomes hydrogel named FHE@exosomes have been developed for wound therapy. The hydrogel was mainly composed of polypeptide and oxidative hyaluronic acid (OHA), which had thermal-responsive property. The hydrogel regulated the release of exosomes. Results showed that this FHE@exosomes had rapid self\u2014healing and high antibacterial activity [95]. In addition, AD-MSCs exosomes with miR-375-overexpressing promoted bone regeneration [96]. This means that when exosomes from BM-MSCs are not suitable for treating the disease, AD-MSCs derived exosomes may be a good alternative. A recent study tried to combine AD-MSCs exosomes with a polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffold to repair the skull defect and obtained certain curative effects [97].",

Compared to using MSCs directly for disease treatment, EVs reduced the risk of rejection of transplantation and variation.",

The research also indicated that microvesicles had opposite effects on neurons, inhibiting the growth of neurons [4]. And for glioblastoma, BM-MSCs EVs and UC-MSC EVs decreased glioblastoma cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, while adipose tissue MSC-EVs increased glioblastoma cell proliferation and had no effect with cell apoptosis. Experiments also showed that UC-MSC EVs performed superior effects on glioblastoma and can deliver drugs to cancer cells [21]. As for human embryonic mesenchymal stem cells, they had a more powerful neuroprotective capacity than fetal MSC-EVs [106]. However, for other diseases, which MSCs-EVs are more effective need to be further explored.",
