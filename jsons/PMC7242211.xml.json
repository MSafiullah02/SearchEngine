            "text": "Pediatric literature on asthma usually distinguishes preschool recurrent wheeze / also called preschool asthma in children aged 5 years and younger; from school-age children asthma, in those aged 6 to 11 years; and adolescent asthma, in those aged 12-17 years [3], [5], [6]. During preschool years, these events can be isolated, with few or no interval symptoms, and their persistence despite conventional maintenance treatment, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), is a marker of severity [6], [7]. Although viral infections are the main triggers of acute asthma, early and multiple allergic sensitization is a strong risk factor of presenting severe and frequent exacerbations [7], [8]. In school-age children and adolescents, acute asthma attacks are usually less frequent, and not only triggered by lung infections, but also by exposure to allergens and pollutants [3], [9], [10]. Exacerbations rates increase with the severity of the disease, which is defined according to treatment pressure to obtain asthma control [4], [5]. Repetition of frequent and severe episodes under high doses of ICS associated with another maintenance treatment (mainly long acting beta2 agonists) is a criteria of severe asthma in these age-groups [11], [12], as demonstrated in pediatric asthma cohorts [13], [14]. Additionally, it is now recognized that patients prone to exacerbations constitute a distinct susceptibility phenotype, possibly associated with different endotypes, including specific airway inflammation patterns, or inflammatory mechanisms in response to infectious agents [15]. In some individuals, the severity of the disease and propensity to develop acute asthma may also vary throughout the course of childhood [16]. These early-life events can influence the long-term evolution at adult-age, in terms of asthma persistence, phenotype and alterations of lung function, that may lead to early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [17]. Early interventions could modify the natural history of the disease. However, in children with severe asthma, conventional maintenance therapies may be insufficient to prevent asthma attacks [7], [18], and repeated or prolonged oral corticosteroids are associated with many side effects, such as defective growth [19]. New treatment strategies are now needed. Interestingly, some studies have shown the efficacy of biologics in pediatric asthma, mainly on severe exacerbations, and suggested disease-modifying properties of some of them, making it a particularly attractive strategy in children [20].",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinoviruses (RV), both RNA viruses, are among the most common causes of lower respiratory tract infections, i.e. bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia, with a predominance of RSV in the first 12 months of life and then RV in the following years [22]. Birth cohort studies and other epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between early RV-induced wheeze, and to a lesser extent, RSV-induced wheeze, and subsequent development of childhood asthma [23], [24], [25], [26]. Moreover, pediatric asthma attacks are mainly triggered by respiratory viruses, particularly RV, both in the preschool and school-age [10], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. The question of whether asthma-associated underlying inflammation promotes the pathogenic effect of viral infection or whether the virus induces exaggerated inflammation is still under debate and has been the subject of many research studies over the past 25 years.",

Neonatal airway colonization with bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been associated with persistence of asthma [32]. Indeed, Kloepfer, et al. have shown frequent viral and bacterial co-infection in asthmatic children aged 2-18 years [33]. It is well known that viral infection can predispose to bacterial secondary infection. A few studies have begun to describe inflammatory phenotypes linked with altered microbiota, known as dysbiosis, within the airways [34], [35]. Interactions between viruses and bacteria, personal risk factors (e.g. genetic background and atopy), and environmental exposures may promote more severe acute asthma episodes that will influence the progression of asthma [21]. However, the precise role of each of these factors and their interplay with the host immune defenses remains to be elucidated.",

Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are the main cellular targets of pathogens, and act as sentinel cells in response to infection (\nFig 1\n)\n[36], [37], [38]. These structural cells are a central part of innate immune response [39]. They first act as a complex physicochemical barrier, via the presence of tight intercellular junctions and the muco-ciliary escalator, clearing foreign particles out. If not cleared, Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMP) on the surface of infectious agents, will then be recognized through Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR), in particular Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) and intracellular RNA helicases, which will trigger innate immune responses. Although AEC play an early and central role in orchestrating innate immune defenses, innate immune cells including alveolar macrophages (AM) and dendritic cells (DC), especially plasmacytoid DC (pDC), are also involved in innate immune responses against pathogens [40], [41], [42], [43], [44].",

In cultures of primary AEC from children with severe therapy resistant asthma (STRA), lower expression levels of extracellular and intracellular PRR than healthy controls were observed at baseline [45]. Expression of PRR was also decreased upon infection with RV on these cultures and in those from adult asthmatics, suggesting a persistent defect in adulthood [45], [46]. Hence, in AM from adults with severe asthma, Rupani, et al. also showed a reduction of TLR7 expression after RV infection compared with healthy subjects, with an effect potentially mediated by microRNAs [47]. Conversely, in ex vivo cultures of cells from broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from adults with mild-to-moderate asthma, no impairment of PRR expression (TLR, RNA-helicases) was observed [48]. This discrepancy was also illustrated by our in vivo real-life study conducted in 72 school-age children with allergic asthma hospitalized for severe exacerbation, associated with viral infection in 64% (RV: 51%) [49]. Whereas viral infection did not modulate PRR expression and function on PBMC as compared with non-infected asthmatic patients, a reduced expression of PRR was reported in a sub-group of children prone to reinfection outside an exacerbation (steady state 8 weeks later), and displaying neutrophilic airway inflammation away from exacerbation [10], [49]. Although present both at exacerbation and steady state, this impairment of PRR expression as well as the inflammatory profile was not associated with the clinical evolution and risk of exacerbations in the year following exacerbation [50].",

LL-37, also called human cationic antimicrobial peptide is the only human peptide of the cathelicidin family and one of the most-studied [52], [53]. In in vitro models, LL-37 has the ability to reduce virus replication, notably for RSV [53], [54].

They have observed a defect of production of type I IFN. In response to RV, most ex-vivo studies have demonstrated an impairment of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 production in AEC from pediatric asthmatic patients compared to levels observed in cells from healthy controls [45], [56], [57], [58]. This impairment was also demonstrated in adult cells [59], [60], [61]. Interestingly, similar results have been observed in ex-vivo cultures of PBMC. As early as 2002, Bufe, et al. have shown in an ex-vivo model a defective production of IFN-\u03b1 in PBMC from pediatric asthmatic patients compared to healthy controls, upon Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection, an avian respiratory virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family and well-known potent inductor of IFN-\u03b1 [62]. They later extended these observations in whole blood cells cultures from adult asthmatics, upon infection with either NDV of RSV [63]. In the later years, similar results have been shown in pediatric studies [64], [65] but also in adult studies [45], [48], [66]. So far, only a few studies have been conducted upon in vivo inoculation and natural infection. In a cohort of preschool children, IFN-\u03b1 systemic levels were reduced at the time of RV-induced exacerbation in asthmatics, as compared with healthy controls during an asymptomatic RV infection [30]. In our recently published cohort of preschool asthmatic children with natural virus-induced exacerbation (RV: 73%), the most severe children, who were prone-to-exacerbation, displayed lower plasma concentrations of IFN-\u03b2 at exacerbation than the others, suggesting a defect of production in response to viruses limited to this sub-population [8]. In another study conducted in older children, we did not observe altered IFN responses in sputum, plasma and cultures of stimulated-PBMC of patients presenting a virus-induced exacerbation, compared with those with a non-virus-induced exacerbation [49]. In adult asthmatics, a significant type I IFN defect was demonstrated in bronchial epithelium and sub-epithelium obtained from bronchial biopsies compared with healthy controls, after experimental infection with RV-A16 [67]. In contrast, Schwantes, et al. described elevated rather than low RNA levels of type I IFN in sputum from adult asthmatic patients, compared to those observed in healthy subjects, early in the course of a virus-induced exacerbation.[68].",

This will promote the adaptive immune response through DC maturation and migration to draining lymph nodes associated with the airways. Dendritic cells will thus induce na\u00efve T cell differentiation into antigen-specific T cells. This will drive the adaptive immune response within the airways to clear the virus out. The alarmins also contribute to a biased T helper (Th)2 immune response by activating type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and polarizing DC in order to promote T cells differentiation (Fig 1). This specific cytokine environment in asthmatic patients favor na\u00efve T cells polarization into Th2 cells, producing IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, as opposed to Th1 cells, producing IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b2 [37], [72]. These cytokines are responsible for the type 2 inflammation and induce the pathophysiological features of asthma, including eosinophil mobilization, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle hyperplasia and airflow obstruction [3], [73]. . Under the influence of IL-5, eosinophils will enter the airways and perpetuate type 2 inflammation [49], [74]. They will also contribute to resolution of immune responses, including tissue repair [75]. Other cytokines, such as type 17 cytokines: IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, can also promote mucus hypersecretion and production of cytokines and chemokines by AEC. They will favor the recruitment of neutrophils, through the induction of C-X-C chemokines, conducting to a state of chronic inflammation [67]. In the longer term, IL-17 may contribute to the development of airway remodeling during asthma by enhancing the production of profibrotic cytokines, proangiogenic factors, proteases and collagen [76], [77].",

            "text": "In children, the influence of respiratory viruses and innate immune mechanisms on the adaptive immune response development may be crucial. First, some respiratory viruses may induce the release of alarmins, and thus favor the development of Th2 inflammation. A recently published study showed that children with RV-positive-bronchiolitis displayed increased IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio in nasopharyngeal aspirates [78]. Upon RSV infection, Lee, et al. observed a higher production of TSLP by AEC from asthmatic children compared to healthy controls [79]. Hence, some respiratory viruses may induce Th2 inflammation in the airways of children and this may be increased in an asthmatic environment. In a cohort of preschool asthmatic children, ILC markers, such as soluble ST2, were induced in vivo following RV infection in preschool asthmatic children, and were correlated with nasal levels of IL-33 [80]. In our study of school-age children, at exacerbation, airway inflammation in infected patients was characterized by significantly higher IL-5 concentration and eosinophil count than in non-infected patients [49]. This may not be specific to childhood, as Jackson, et al. have also demonstrated an induction of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in BAL following RV inoculation in asthmatic subjects, associated with exacerbation severity [81]. Additional in vitro experiments showed that IL-33 directly induced Th2 cytokine production by T cells and ILC2. However, this RV-inducedTh2 inflammation could be limited to an asthmatic environment in adults, as suggested by an in vitro study reproducing the induction of IL-4 and IL-13 by asthmatic PBMC after co-exposition with RV and IL-33, but showing no effect on PBMC from healthy donors [82]. In addition, exposure to respiratory viruses has also been associated with an increase in Th17 cytokines, as demonstrated in co-cultures of RSV-infected AEC with T cells [83].",

In asthmatic preschool children prone to exacerbation, we observed simultaneously lower production of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3), Th2 cytokines (IL-5), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1), regulatory cytokines (IL-10), and type 1 IFN (IFN-\u03b2) during virus-induced exacerbation in a subgroup of preschool children with characteristics of severe asthma and a history of frequent exacerbations [8]. This association seems to persist in adults, as suggested by Parsons, et al. reporting a parallel decrease of type III IFNs and of IL-6, (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)8 and CXCL10 in adult asthmatic AEC inoculated with RV [46]. In a murine model of allergic asthma, IRF3 controlled the parallel evolution of IFN and Th2 cytokines during acute episodes induced by allergen exposure [84]. Some adult studies have suggested bi-directional influences during viral infection. Upon RV infection, pre-treatment with Th2 cytokines in cultures of AEC may impair TLR3 and IRF3 signaling pathway [59], or type 1 and 3 IFN expression [57]. Lower production of type I IFN, displayed by some children, could also reduce the apoptosis of neighbored-infected cells and increase viral loads, consequently amplifying airway inflammation, inflammatory cytokine production and thus, asthma attack severity [58], [60].",

First, pathogenicity of RV strongly differs according to subtypes, probably because of the implication of different cellular targets. Indeed, infection with RV-C strains, which use cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) as a receptor, may be associated with higher clinical severity [10], [31], [85], whereas B serotypes seem to be responsible for milder symptoms. Interestingly, single nucleotide polymorphism in the CDHR3 gene, which influences the efficiency of RV-C to infect its target cells, has been associated with childhood asthma susceptibility [86]. Moreover, different viral strains could have different replication rates and thus induce higher viral loads [87]. Rhinovirus C strains could also modulate the airways inflammation, and induce higher levels of Th2 and/or Th17 cytokines, as shown in preschool children with RV-C-induced wheeze [88]. Second, systemic viremia has been observed in children infected with respiratory viruses, such as RV-C, and young age was found to be a risk factor associated with viremia [89]. This state could induce an enhanced inflammation in children by interaction of viruses with systemic immune cells. Finally, viral-coinfection has been frequently observed at exacerbation in asthmatic children, particularly in the preschool years [30], [31]. The combined effects of several viruses within the airways may modulate both the innate and adaptive responses.",

Hence, pediatric studies have shown a frequent virus shedding in children, with RV positive samples observed in 19-29% of unselected asthmatic children and in 15-23% of healthy children [10], [28], [90], [91]. In the previously-cited cohort of preschool children prone to exacerbation, we observed even higher rates, with 67% of positive PCR (51% for RV) at steady state [8]. In 78 school-age children, we also observed that 10% of children had positive RV sampling at exacerbation and steady state, and that RV serotypes were systematically different at both time points, pointing toward reinfection rather than persistence [10]. Consistent with these observations, Bergauer, et al. also found 54% of RV at steady state in preschool children with asthma, vs 45% in healthy controls [30]. Interestingly, RV carriage in both asthmatics and healthy controls was found to be associated with higher levels of type III IFN at baseline than in subjects without. This increase in baseline inflammation seems to persist in adulthood. Hence, in sputum cells from 57 asthmatic adults, da Silva, et al. have shown higher baseline levels of IFN and anti-viral molecules compared with healthy subjects [92]. In all, one could hypothesize that RV persistence in asthmatic patients could induce a pro-inflammatory state and/or a desensitization of PRR, which could reduce the response against pathogens within the airways upon new infection.",

This was associated with an aberrant immune response, with increased IL-5 and IL-13 synthesis in PBMC obtained at the age of 6 months [99]. Interestingly, evaluation of the gut microbiota in infants included in the Canadian (CHILD) study showed that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient alterations of the microbiota, known as dysbiosis, in neonates [100]. More specifically, the relative abundance of the commensal bacterial genera Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. Furthermore, antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis has been shown to facilitate the development of allergic asthma in experimental murine models and clinical studies [101]. In a population-based cohort, it has been reported that pre- and post-natal antibiotic exposure was associated with a higher asthma risk [102]. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity whereas wheeze and viral infection were not found to be significantly associated to the bacterial communities. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort, children for whom antibiotics course was reported before the age of 2 years were more likely to have asthma at age 7, although microbiota was not characterized [103]. Similarly, in British Columbia (Canada), \u201dcontrolled\u201d antibiotic use during infancy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of pediatric asthma, and was related with the preservation of gut microbial communities [104]. Altogether, these data confirm the need to preserve the microbiota in early infancy in order to limit the development of asthma.",

Indeed, there are bidirectional interactions between viruses and airway bacteria that appear to modulate the severity of illness and the likelihood of asthma attack [20]. Pediatric studies have shown that upper respiratory tract colonization with Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and/or Staphylococcus genus during RSV and RV infection increases the risk of hospitalization independently of age and of the presence of asthma [105], [106]. In our previously-cited cohort of preschool children, asthma attacks were frequently associated with viral infection (94%, mostly RV). Pathogenic bacteria were isolated in induced sputum in 56%, mainly H. influenza, M. catharralis or S. pneumoniae\n[21]. In adult asthmatics, asymptomatic RV infection was associated with increased abundance of Dolosigranulum and Corynebacterium, whereas symptomatic RV infection seemed to be related with a higher frequency of Moraxella\n[107]. In another adult study, co-infection with virus and bacteria induced higher levels of cytokine/chemokine than bacterial infection [108]. Interestingly, circulating CCL2 and CCL5 concentrations were increased in infected asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatic patients. Streptococcus species may also influence the course of asthma exacerbation, as shown by Kama, et al. in preschool children [109]. Indeed, patients with S. pneumoniae colonization in the pharyngeal microbiota had significantly shorter wheezing episodes and reduced lung inflammation (including lower levels of TNF-\u03b1).",

Mansbach, et al. showed in a joint modeling analysis adjusting for 16 covariates, including viral trigger, that a higher relative abundance of Moraxella or Streptococcus species 3 weeks after day 1 of hospitalization for severe bronchiolitis was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing [111]. In contrast, no significant difference in microbiota composition was observed between oro-pharyngeal microbiota from children with acute wheezing (0-14 years old) and healthy controls [112].

Whereas the commensal Corynebacterium / Dolosigranulum cluster characterized the patients with the lowest risk of disease progression, a switch towards the Moraxella cluster was associated with the highest risk of severe asthma exacerbations. Similarly, in another cohort of school-age asthmatic children, nasal microbiota dominated by Moraxella species was associated with increased exacerbation risk, and eosinophil activation at exacerbation [35]. Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium species\u2013dominated microbiota were linked with reduced respiratory illness and exacerbation event rates, whereas Streptococcus species-dominated microbiota increased the risk of RV infection. Interestingly, using unbiased airway microbiome-driven clustering, Abdel-Aziz, et al. recently described in adult asthmatics two distinct robust severe asthma phenotypes that were associated with airway neutrophilia, and not related to the presence of Moraxella species [114]. Robinson, et al. assessed the lower airway microbiota by performing BAL at steady state in severe preschool wheezers [34]. They reported two profiles: a Moraxella species \u201cdysbiotic\u201d cluster, associated with airway neutrophilia and a \u201cmixed microbiota\u201d cluster associated with macrophage- and lymphocyte-predominant airway inflammation, thus suggesting that bacteria might influence the characteristics of lung inflammation.",

In children, several studies have shown that association of airway neutrophilia with severity is inconstant [115], [116], [117], [118], and may not persist throughout the course of the disease [116], [119]. However, neutrophils present in the airways of severe asthmatic children may have enhanced survival and proinflammatory functions that could increase baseline inflammation [120]. As previously stated, airway neutrophilia has also been associated with a different IFN response, at baseline and at the time of asthma attack, both in adults [66], [92] and pediatric studies [49]. This could have an impact on lung infections. Thus, we have shown that a subgroup of school-aged children with positive viral PCR both at baseline and exacerbation displayed airway neutrophilia [49]. In severe adult asthmatics, airway neutrophilia has also been associated with lesser microbiota diversity in BAL [114], [121]. Finally, experimental RV infection in adult asthmatic subjects directly induces bronchial mucosal neutrophilia [122].

            "text": "Airway eosinophilia is highly frequent in asthmatic children, observed in severe and non-severe asthma, often but not always associated with response to ICS, thus highlighting the diversity of eosinophilic profiles in pediatric asthma [116], [118], [123]. Mouse models and adult studies have suggested a role of IL-5 induced airway eosinophilia as a positive regulator of RV receptor intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on AEC, and a negative regulator of PRR and antiviral responses [124], [125]. However, in children, it remains unclear whether airway eosinophils are involved in the pathophysiology of severe asthma, and in the propensity to develop acute asthma attacks [126]. In addition, peripheral blood eosinophilia, currently used as the basis for selection of eosinophil-targeted biologics, may not be representative of airway eosinophilia in children [127]. Most importantly, it has been reported that eosinophilia is not necessarily associated with higher levels of Th2 cytokines [118], and other cells such as alarmin-stimulated ILC2 may have a greater biological importance in the pathophysiology of asthma attacks [128]. Eosinophils can also have beneficial effects in childhood asthma, as they display regulatory functions and contribute to lung repair and mucosal homeostasis [75]. Peripheral blood eosinophilia has recently been identified has a biomarker predicting the decrease of severity throughout the adolescent years [16]. Finally, it remains to be determined whether eosinophil-targeted biologics, such as anti-IL-5 mepolizumab, are efficient in reducing asthma attacks in children [129]. Overall, as opposed to adults, airway eosinophilia does not appear as the preferential biomarker to classify pediatric patients nor to assess their risk of acute asthma attacks.",

            "text": "Rather than through the recruitment of eosinophils, type 2 inflammation may play a key role in some children\u2019s susceptibility to develop acute asthma attacks through IgE sensitization. Hence, atopy, defined as allergic sensitization, is a key feature associated with risk of asthma attacks in childhood [7], [8], [14]. As shown by latent-class analyses, atopy is also one of the main factors that may account for the heterogeneity of the disease, especially in the preschool years [130], [131] and could drive response to treatment [3]. Pre-existing atopy may play a role in the modulation of IFN response upon viral infection in children, although studies have shown conflicting results [59], [61], [65]. Durrani, et al. have suggested a direct implication of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) in this defect, as its cross-linking on pDC from asthmatic allergic patients is associated with reduced IFN secretion upon RV infection [65]. Following virus-induced exacerbation in atopic children, upregulation of Fc\u03b5RI receptor on monocytes and DC was observed, associated with a concomitant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13 [132], suggesting that respiratory viral infection in atopic children may initiate an atopy-dependent cascade that amplifies virus-induced airway inflammation. This could initiate long-term remodeling and inflammation. Hence, IgE sensitization, especially if occurring early in life and multiple, has been identified as the main factor associated with long-term asthma risk (recurrence of exacerbations, persistence of asthma, impaired lung function) in neonatal cohorts, including MAAS (Great Britain), MAS (Germany), PARIS (France) and PASTURE (Europe) [133], [134], [135], [136].",

For instance, with the development of the Human Genome Project, genome-wide association studies have allowed to link childhood asthma with association signals in or near genes involved in innate immune response pathways, such as the TLR1 locus, and the IL-33 locus [141], [142]. Transcriptomics analyses, which aim at investigating all RNA transcripts in a biological sample, will certainly enable the identification of a large quantity of genes modulated in certain conditions. A recent study has described 94 distinct gene-expression modules between virus-induced and non-virus-induced exacerbation in nasal and sputum cells from a large cohort of school-age children [143]. In asthma attacks, this tool may also provide information on the activated pathways linked with inflammatory and anti-microbial response [144], [145]. RNA sequencing in nasal lavage cells from asthmatic children at exacerbation led to identify some genes overexpressed as relevant \u201cnodes\u201d linking genes of the inflammatory response, such as IRF7 [144]. Transcriptomic analyses have also been used to identify genes associated with different phenotypes of asthmatic patients [146]. Finally, metabolomics, the study of the metabolites produced in living systems (both humans and microbiota) represents another promising strategy in the upcoming years to address the role of immuno-metabolism as well as lung and gut microbiota in asthma pathophysiology [147], [148].",

One of the strategies to enhance their anti-viral responses could involve stimulation of PRR. This strategy has only been tested in pre-clinical and adult studies. Following promising results from pre-clinical studies [149], Silkoff, et al. reported results of a clinical trial assessing the effect of CNTO3157, a TLR3 agonist, upon in vivo inoculation of RV-A16 in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate asthma [150]. The molecule was ineffective in blocking the effect of RV-16 challenge on the onset of asthma exacerbation, without effect on asthma symptoms nor lung function. Additionally, all post-inoculation exacerbations occurred in the CNTO3157 group, and two were severe, thus pointing toward a lack of efficacy and safety of the TLR3 targeting drugs.",

Indeed, Tian, et al. have described, in a mouse model, a prolonged IFN response upon S. pneumonia and S. aureus infection, inducing an impaired bacterial clearance [152].

Two main therapies have been described: polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysates (PMBL\u00ae) and Broncho-Vaxom OM-85 BV. They contain lysates of 8 pathogenic bacteria including H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Both PMBL\u00ae and OM-85 administration have proven to be efficient in preventing respiratory tract infections in adult and pediatric patients with chronic bronchitis and/or history of recurrent chronic infections [155], [156], [157], [158], [159]. Interestingly, in a trial conducted in elderly COPD patients, Ricci, et al. observed a reduced number of seroconversion against numerous viral pathogens in patients treated with PMBL\u00ae, as well as a better control of the number of all infectious episodes and COPD exacerbations, suggesting that the preventing effect of PMBL\u00ae on acute infections was not only on bacterial infections, but also on viral infections [160]. In 152 school-aged children with allergic asthma, Emerick, et al. have described a reduction of exacerbations after 12 weeks of treatment with PMBL\u00ae, and no serious adverse event, although no improvement of asthma control scores were achieved [161]. In 75 preschool children with recurrent wheeze, Razi, et al. demonstrated that OM-85 BV reduced the rate and duration of wheezing episodes in the 12 months following the treatment initiation, and reduced the number of acute respiratory tract illnesses [162]. Finally, in toddlers aged 6-18 months, a clinical trial is ongoing to assess the preventive effect of OM-85V on the onset of first wheeze episode related to lower respiratory tract infection during a 3 years observational period [163]. Regarding the mechanisms of action, prevention of acute respiratory infections was not induced by purified LPS or bacterial DNA, suggesting that other PAMP contained in bacterial lysates would activate innate immunity and lead to promotion of type 1 inflammation by DC [164], [165], [166].",

Thus, it has been hypothesized that supplementing with LL-37 or inducing its production among AEC could enhance anti-infectious defenses. Sousa, et al. have tested the effect of exogenous cathelicidin on RV-1B replication after inoculation on cultures of AEC [167]. They reported that exogenous LL-37, as well as homologous porcine cathelicidins, either administered prior or after infection, displayed antiviral activity against RV by reducing the metabolic activity of infected cells. However, one preclinical study in a mouse model of asthma showed in vivo a deleterious effect of exogenous cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide in airway inflammation and responsiveness [168], and to our knowledge, there is no published study in vivo in humans. Nevertheless, promising results regarding vitamin D supplementation on the release of LL-37 by AEC in in vitro experiments have been published [169], [170], [171]. In clinical studies, there is evidence toward a protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of acute respiratory infections in children [172]. Although there are other effects of vitamin D that might explain its clinical efficacy [80], [173], there is a well-studied biological link between vitamin D and host microbial peptides, via the translocation of vitamin D to the nucleus of AEC, where it activates Vitamin v responsive elements in promoter regions of anti-microbial peptide genes such as LL-37 [52], [171], [174]. Hence, targeting the vitamin D / cathelicidin axis could represent a promising strategy during acute asthma in children.",

Interferon therapies (pegylated IFN-\u03b1 in association with ribavirin) have first been developed in other diseases such as in hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus [175], [176]. Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside that impairs the synthesis of viral mRNA [52]. Its clinical utility, upon respiratory virus infection, has been shown in RSV, Adenovirus, RV, or in (SARS)-CoV immunocompromised patients [177], [178], [179], [180]. Since exogenous IFNs reduced RV replication in in vitro cultures of RV-infected AEC from asthmatic patients [181], a trial was initiated in 147 adult asthmatic patients developing symptoms of viral infection (68% RV) to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled IFN-\u03b2 treatment for 14 days [182]. Overall, it did not improve asthma symptoms, but it enhanced morning peak expiratory flow recovery and reduced the need for additional treatment, i.e. oral corticosteroids or antibiotics. In an exploratory analysis of the subset of more difficult-to-treat patients, IFN supplementation improved asthma control questionnaires. In addition, it boosted anti-viral innate immunity with persistent elevated serum levels of CXCL10, and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules such as CCL4 and CXCL8. In the INEXAS phase 2 trial, designed to assess efficacy of inhaled IFN-\u03b21a for 14 days to prevent asthma exacerbations in adults, McCrae, et al. also reported improvement in the morning peak expiratory flow in the treated arm compared with placebo, but the study stopped early [183], [184].

Treatments aiming to influence the composition of the microbiota are presently tested in different clinical situations and recent data have suggested that these methods might have some interest in asthma. Transplantation of healthy microbiota seems a promising alternative as demonstrated in gut inflammatory diseases [190]. In preclinical study, Arrieta, et al. demonstrated that oral inoculation with four bacterial species previously identified as associated with risk of childhood asthma to germ-free mice improved allergic airway inflammation in their adult offspring [100]. Several studies have also evaluated the benefit of prebiotic and probiotic but their interest during childhood asthma attack has yet to be evaluated [191], [192]. Another option may be to administer bacteria metabolites, which can mimic the effect of normal microbiota. Thus, feeding pregnant mice with short chain fatty acid (SCFA), such as acetate, was associated with modulation of the maternal microbiota and protection from developing allergic airway disease in the offspring [193]. Finally, an increasing number of studies in experimental models of lung infections has demonstrated the potential interest of fecal microbiota transplantation and/or SCFA supplementation, suggesting that they might be efficient in bacteria- and virus-induced exacerbations [194], [195], [196].",

It is not clear whether chronic colonization by these pathogens is causative for severe persistent wheeze in some preschool children and whether these children might benefit from antibiotic treatment. We assessed the relevance of bacterial colonization and chronic airway infection in preschool children with severe persistent wheezing and evaluated the outcome of long-time antibiotic treatment on the clinical course in such children.\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Preschool children (n = 42) with severe persistent wheeze but no symptoms of acute pulmonary infection were investigated by bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Differential cell counts and microbiological and virological analyses were performed on BAL samples. Patients diagnosed with bacterial infection were treated with antibiotics for 2-16 weeks (n = 29). A modified ISAAC questionnaire was used for follow-up assessment of children at least 6 months after bronchoscopy. Of the 42 children with severe wheezing, 34 (81%) showed a neutrophilic inflammation and 20 (59%) of this subgroup had elevated bacterial counts (\u2265 104 colony forming units per milliliter) suggesting infection. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were the most frequently isolated species. After treatment with appropriate antibiotics 92% of patients showed a marked improvement of symptoms upon follow-up examination.\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic bacterial infections are relevant in a subgroup of preschool children with persistent wheezing and such children benefit significantly from antibiotic therapy.\u201d,\u201ccontainer-title\u201d:\u201cPloS One\u201d,\u201cDOI\u201d:\u201c10.1371/journal.pone.0027913\u201d,\u201cISSN\u201d:\u201c1932-6203\u201d,\u201cissue\u201d:\u201c11\u201d,\u201cjournalAbbreviation\u201d:\u201cPLoS ONE\u201d,\u201clanguage\u201d:\u201ceng\u201d,\u201cnote\u201d:\u201cPMID: 22140482\\nPMCID: PMC3226624\u201d,\u201cpage\u201d:\u201ce27913\u201d,\u201csource\u201d:\u201cPubMed\u201d,\u201ctitle\u201d:\u201cWheeze in preschool age is associated with pulmonary bacterial infection and resolves after antibiotic therapy\u201d,\u201cvolume\u201d:\u201c6\u201d,\u201cauthor\u201d:[{\u201cfamily\u201d:\u201cSchwerk\u201d,\u201cgiven\u201d:\u201cNicolaus\u201d},{\u201cfamily\u201d:\u201cBrinkmann\u201d,\u201cgiven\u201d:\u201cFolke\u201d},{\u201cfamily\u201d:\u201cSoudah\u201d,\u201cgiven\u201d:\u201cBisharah\u201d},{\u201cfamily\u201d:\u201cKabesch\u201d,\u201cgiven\u201d:\u201cMichael\u201d},{\u201cfamily\u201d:\u201cHansen\u201d,\u201cgiven\u201d:\u201cGesine\u201d}],\u201cissued\u201d:{\u201cdate-parts\u201d:[[\u201c2011\u201d]]}}}],\u201cschema\u201d:\u201chttps://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json\u201d} [197]. Second, immunomodulatory effects of macrolides are well-described [198], and have been evaluated in the treatment of acute asthma in children. Hence, in the Early Administration of Azithromycin and Prevention of Severe Lower Respiratory Tract Illnesses in Preschool Children (APRIL) study, Bacharier, et al. conducted a pacebo-controlled trial in 607 preschool children with recurrent wheeze and no controller medication, testing the efficacy of azithromycin started prior to the development of lower respiratory tract illness [199]. Macrolide administration reduced the risk of progressing to severe lower respiratory tract illness (i.e requiring a course of oral steroids), without evidence for induction of azithromycin-resistant organisms, nor adverse events. In the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC2010) cohort, children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, some of whom under maintenance treatment, were randomly assigned to receive either azithromycin or placebo in case of episode of asthma-like symptoms, lasting at least 3 days [200]. Children treated with azithromycin displayed a significant reduction of episode length, and the effect size increased with early administration of treatment. Moreover, Mandhane, et al. conducted a placebo-control trial in preschool children aged 12 to 60 months, presenting to the emergency department with wheeze, to assess the effect of azithromycin [201]. They did not show a reduction of duration of respiratory symptoms in the treated group, neither in the time to the next exacerbation upon 6 months follow-up. Thus, there is still limited evidence on the use of azithromycin as a preventive treatment of acute asthma attacks [202]. In addition, studies have been conducted in adult patients to test the effect of azithromycin as a preventive strategy, with conflicting results [203], [204], [205]. Notably, Gibson, et al. described in a placebo-controlled trial that 48 weeks maintenance treatment with azithromycin decreased the frequency of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma-related quality of life in symptomatic asthma despite current maintenance treatment [204]. In a meta-analysis of the three main studies conducted in adult patients [203], [204], [205], maintenance treatment with azithromycin was associated with a reduced rate of exacerbations in asthma as well as in all subgroups (non-eosinophilic, eosinophilic and severe asthma), and a good tolerance [206]. Examining each exacerbation type separately, patients with eosinophilic asthma reported fewer oral corticosteroid courses, and patients with non-eosinophilic and severe asthma reported fewer antibiotic courses. Additionally, a specific effect of macrolides in neutrophilic asthma had been reported previously by Simpson, et al. in adult subjects with severe refractory asthma, treated with clarithromycin for 8 weeks [207]. Clarithromycin therapy reduced sputum concentrations of IL-8 and neutrophil numbers leading to lower levels of neutrophil elastase and Matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 concentrations versus placebo. Finally, a decrease of inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-33, was observed in vitro in cultures of human AEC from asthmatic patients pretreated with clarithromycin, in a context of RV14 infection, suggesting a direct anti-viral effect [208]. Consistent with this hypothesis, another in vitro study showed an effect of azithromycin to reduce RV replication after inoculation in AEC, associated with an increase in IFN and interferon-stimulated genes mRNA expression and protein production [209].",

After proof of efficacy in pediatric clinical trials, it has been widely prescribed in severe asthmatic atopic children aged older than 6 years, providing more insights on the longer-term evolution [210]. In real-life studies, we have observed higher levels of asthma control after its initiation, and a significant decrease of asthma attacks in children previously prone to exacerbation [211]. Hence, a direct effect of omalizumab on RV-induced exacerbations in children has been suggested [212], [213]. In the Preventative Omalizumab or Step-up Therapy for Severe Fall Exacerbations (PROSE) study, a placebo-controlled trial conducted among 478 inner-city asthmatic children aged 6 to 17 years with 1 or more recent exacerbations, Esquivel, et al. observed a decrease of the duration of RV infections, viral shedding, and risk of RV-induced illnesses in omalizumab-treated patients [212]. A recently published adult study including results from two clinical trials has compared the effect of omalizumab on the response to an experimental inoculation with RV-16 in allergic asthmatic adults [214]. Omalizumab-treated patients displayed a reduction of symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, more pronounced in the four first days following inoculation, suggesting that the protective effect of omalizumab on virus-induced exacerbations occurs in the early stages of infection. Teach, et al. described other results from the PROSE study that compared omalizumab with placebo and omalizumab with an inhaled corticosteroid boost with regard to fall exacerbation rates when initiated 4 to 6 weeks before return to school [215]. They recorded 86 exacerbations, among which 89% were associated with a respiratory tract virus detection, most commonly RV (81%). More importantly, they observed a significantly lower fall exacerbation rate in the omalizumab group, but no difference between omalizumab and inhaled corticosteroid boost except in the subgroup of patients with exacerbation during the run-in phase. In an ex vivo study of PBMC taken during the intervention phase, the authors observed increased IFN-\u03b1 responses following RV-A16 inoculation in the omalizumab-treated group, suggesting that the mechanism of Omalizumab protection against exacerbations could involve IFN-\u03b1 dependent antiviral effect [20]. Another study in children with exacerbation-prone asthma before and during omalizumab treatment described the effect of ex vivo inoculation of RV and Influenza A virus on PBMC and blood pDC, after IgE cross-linking on cell-surface Fc\u03b5RI [216]. The authors observed that omalizumab increased both virus-induced IFN-\u03b1 responses in PBMCs and pDC, and subsequently reduced Fc\u03b5RI expression on pDC. Altogether, the lower asthma exacerbation rates consecutive to omalizumab treatment were related to IFN-\u03b1 responses and attenuated Fc\u03b5RI expression on pDC.",

            "text": "Omalizumab remains the most-studied biologic in pediatric asthma but others have been experimented in the past years [217]. Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 antibody therapy, has proven to be efficient in reducing the exacerbation rate in adults and is now available in children older than 6 years old with eosinophilic asthma in Europe and the US [218]. As previously stated, its efficacy in reducing exacerbation rates in pediatric clinical trials and real-life studies remain to be determined [129]. However, adult studies suggest it may have a modifying effect on RV-induced inflammatory response. Hence, a placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adult patients with mild asthma, randomized to receive mepolizumab versus placebo, followed by RV-16 inoculation, to study its impact on anti-viral responses [219]. The authors showed that mepolizumab attenuated baseline blood eosinophils numbers and activation status, but did not prevent the activation of remaining eosinophils upon RV infection. However, after infection, it enhanced levels of airway B lymphocytes and AM and modified BAL levels of CCL20 and IL-1RA. Effects of other drugs targeting Th2 cytokines and alarmins, including lebrikizumab (anti IL-13), dupilumab (anti IL-4R), reslizumab (anti-IL-5), benralizumab (anti-IL-5R), tezepelumab (anti-TSLP), or anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibodies are currently studied in pre-clinical and clinical studies [217].",
