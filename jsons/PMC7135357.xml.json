SSTIs should be treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials with timely surgical intervention for necrotizing fasciitis. The treatment of endotipsitis relies mainly on antimicrobial therapy because infected stent removal is impractical.

Serum B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide may help to differentiate between these 2 entities in patients presenting with acute dyspnea. A recent trial in patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea found that a model using procalcitonin was more accurate than any other individual clinical variable for pneumonia diagnosis in all patients, and in those with acute HF.141 The study found that patients with acute HF and an elevated procalcitonin concentration (>0.21 ng/mL) had a worse outcome if not treated with antibiotics.141 Thoracic ultrasound demonstrating B-lines that suggests thickened interstitial or fluid-filled alveoli, seen most commonly in patients with HF, have been suggested to further aid in differentiating pneumonia from HF.142\n",
