We extend results of Luise and Savar\u00e9 on contraction inequalities for the heat semigroup on P(X) when X is an RCD(K, \u221e) metric space, with respect to the Hellinger and Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances, and explore applications to more general Markov kernels satisfying a reverse Poincar\u00e9 inequality. A key idea is a \"dynamic dual\" formulation of these transportation distances. We also modify this formulation to define a new family of divergences on P(X) which generalize the R\u00e9nyi divergence, and relate them to reverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Applications include results on the convergence of Markov processes to equilibrium, and on quasi-invariance of heat kernel measures in finite and infinite-dimensional groups.",

There, the authors study a \"dynamic dual\" formulation of various distances between probability measures on a metric measure space, including the Kantorovich-Wasserstein and Hellinger distances as well as a family of Hellinger-Kantorovich distances HK \u03b1 introduced in [22] . They focus on the setting of RCD(K, \u221e) spaces, in which the canonical heat semigroup P t generated by the Cheeger energy satisfies a Bakry-\u00c9mery curvature condition; these spaces are, very roughly speaking, more general analogues of Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below. Under this assumption, they obtain contraction inequalities of the form He 2 (\u00b5 0 P t , \u00b5 1 P t ) \u2264 HK \u03b1(t) (\u00b5 0 , \u00b5 1 ) (1.1)",

By the Feldman-Hajek dichotomy theorem for Gaussian measures, they must therefore be mutually absolutely continuous, which we denote by \u00b5 t \u223c \u00b5 h/n t .

Although this argument uses only the reverse Poincar\u00e9 inequality, which is a priori weaker than the reverse logarithmic Sobolev inequality used in Proposition 6.2, the conclusion is also weaker as it does not yield any quantitative information about the distance between the measures \u00b5 t , \u00b5 h t . We note that some proofs of the Feldman-Hajek dichotomy theorem, including Feldman's original proof [17, 18] , make use of the Cameron-Martin quasi-invariance theorem, which would seem to make the above argument circular.

These groups carry a natural sub-Riemannian geometry analogous to the Heisenberg group and other Carnot groups of step two. They use generalized curvature-dimension inequalities to show that these spaces satisfy a reverse logarithmic Sobolev inequality. From this, they derive a Wang-type Harnack inequality, and use this to show quasi-invariance of the heat kernel measure under the group translation. In this section, we show that as in the case of Gaussian measures, transport inequalities provide an alternate route from reverse log Sobolev to quasi-invariance in this setting. We only sketch the argument here, as the details are closely analogous to those for the Gaussian case.",

Since the reverse logarithmic Sobolev inequality holds, Corollary 4.11 and (6.5) imply T 0,2/t (\u00b5 t , \u00b5 h t ) \u2264 T 1,2/t (\u03b4 0 , \u03b4 h ) \u2264 2 te exp t h 2 H /8 < \u221e (6.6) and so by Lemma 4.3 we have \u00b5 h t \u226a \u00b5 t . The reverse statement \u00b5 t \u226a \u00b5 h t follows similarly.Indeed, applying (4.11) with C = 2/t, we obtainOn the other hand, since the density \u033a = d\u00b5 h t d\u00b5t is known explicitly, one can easily compute that in fact D q (\u00b5 h t \u00b5 t ) = q h 2 H /2t. In particular, as t \u2192 \u221e, we have p \u2192 1 and q \u223c t 2 , so we see that both sides of (6.7) approach 1 4 h 2 H and the estimate becomes sharp.One may also study these inequalities for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup Q s , which is the symmetric Markov semigroup on L 2 (\u00b5) generated by the Dirichlet formSee for instance [2, Section 3] , noting that the carr\u00e9 du champ of Q s is \u0393(F, F ) = DF 2 H , without a factor of 1 2 . We have \u03b4 h Q s = \u00b5 e \u2212s h 1\u2212e \u22122s , so to compare with the previous statements, let t = 1 \u2212 e \u22122s , where 0 < t < 1, and replace h by e s h = (1 \u2212 t) \u22121/2 h. We obtainwhere C = 2 e 2s \u22121 = 2 1\u2212t t . Using (4.11), settingp = e C = e 2(1\u2212t)/t and 1 p + 1 q = 1, we have the different estimateAs t \u2192 1, we haveq \u223c 1/(2 \u2212 2t) and both sides are asymptotically h 2 H /(4 \u2212 4t). Finally, we remark that the Cameron-Martin quasi-invariance theorem can also be obtained from Corollary 3.7. Indeed, the reverse Poincar\u00e9 inequality (6.3) for P t implies W 0,1/t (\u00b5 t , \u00b5 h t ) \u2264 W 1,1/t (\u03b4 0 , \u03b4 h ) (6.11) or in other wordsusing the bound from Proposition 3.3, which can be adapted to the Cameron-Martin distance in a similar way to (6.5). Unfortunately, (6.12) has no content unless 1 4t h 2 H <",
