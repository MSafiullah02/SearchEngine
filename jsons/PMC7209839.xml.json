However, an increasing body of evidence is guiding swift global action against the virus. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, notably close to a wet animal market that sells poultry, snakes, and bats.1 The virus shares most of its genetic sequence with coronaviruses found in bats and is thought to arise from that animal, although an infected bat with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified to confirm this theory.2 From Wuhan, the virus crossed over to the human population and spread throughout China and beyond: by March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which is the worldwide spread of a new disease that crosses continents and affects a large number of people.3",

The virus is spread person-to-person and appears to linger in the air for up to 3 hours and upon various surfaces from 24 hours to 3 days.4 Accordingly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend contact and airborne precautions with personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 respirators.5 The virus utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor as its entry point, which is located predominantly in the lung alveolar epithelial cells and the enterocytes of the small intestine.6 Accordingly, COVID-19 presents both as an upper respiratory infection characterized by cough, fever, and fatigue that progresses to pneumonia and as a gastrointestinal illness characterized by diarrhea.7 The progression from mild symptoms to respiratory failure requiring ventilation can be rapid, and cardiac failure has also been implicated. Chest radiographs reveal bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, and computed tomography of the lungs reveals ground glass opacities.8 At the moment, supportive therapies are indicated as treatment. While there are no specific treatments officially, medications are being tested including hydroxychloroquine (a retrofitted anti-malaria and autoimmune drug, which has been employed in China and France) and antiretrovirals such as remdesivir.9\u201311 There is no approved prophylactic medication at this time. Vaccines are under development as a long-term approach aimed toward prevention (Table 1).",

This pandemic was the source of great interest for scientists looking to understand what made it so deadly to learn from the past. The Spanish Flu\u2014like COVID-19\u2014caused severe pneumonia and pulmonary inflammation. Epidemiologists considered the global landscape in 1918. World War I was underway, troops were traveling the world in close contact and acting as vectors, vaccines did not exist and neither did antibiotics, and there were no viral tests. There were no local, state, or federal governing bodies that were prepared to manage an outbreak or pandemic.12 This situation is not the case today, and we have learned from the Spanish Flu. We have the CDC in the United States and the World Health Organization globally monitoring and responding to outbreaks. We have governments ready to mobilize resources and implement social distancing policy via school closures, limiting large gatherings, and shelter-in-place measures. The US Strategic National Stockpile stores facemasks, medications, and other materials to respond to a pandemic (Table 2). We are able to test for COVID-19 and to study it using evidence-based medicine. All of these measures have been deployed in recent days to reduce the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic in the United States and abroad, as much as possible. That China has reported no new domestic coronavirus cases for the third day in a row is encouraging, albeit unusual, news.13",

A slow, steady stream of patients is more manageable compared to a sudden influx of sick patients requiring hospitalization (Table 3).14 This technique is employed once efforts at containment of an outbreak have failed. China has reported success with measures that would not be easily supported in a democratic society. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, however, similarly managed to flatten the curve of new cases without such extreme measures. What can we learn from their handling of the virus? All were quick to screen and then ban entry of flights and individuals from infected regions of China. Social distancing was employed early using the same six-foot benchmark and avoidance of gathering in large numbers. Inhabitants were educated about hand hygiene and wearing masks if they felt ill. The handling and isolation of symptomatic patients and those with travel exposure have been aggressive and appropriate\u2013separate screening locations, separate clinical teams, and separate treatment facilities were used to avoid exposing other patients and limit the possibility of healthcare personnel becoming vectors of transmission themselves. Health authorities have been aggressive in tracking down sick contacts via interviews and closed-circuit television footage and quarantining those at risk. Singapore and Hong Kong were more likely to place identified at-risk individuals in state-controlled quarantine facilities. Taiwan focused on home quarantine reinforced by hefty fines for those who did not comply. Taiwan and Hong Kong closed schools, while Singapore did not. In short, these 3 regions were swift and aggressive in their response, and they have been effective in limiting their cases despite neighboring China, the epicenter of the outbreak (Table 3). Lessons learned from the past century of pandemics should be heeded and rapidly implemented. Had efforts like these been implemented in Wuhan, perhaps the pandemic could have been avoided (Table 4).15\u201317",

The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the Aesthetic Society, and most state medical and regulatory boards have appropriately recommended canceling all elective and nonessential cases.20 This action serves multiple purposes of opening hospital beds for incoming COVID-19 patients, preserving healthcare equipment and resources, and avoiding hospitalizations for patients recovering from elective surgery, which can also place them at risk in a hospital housing infected patients. Additionally, canceling elective surgery supports social distancing in the healthcare setting. Practices that are functionally shut down at this time can elect to donate resources, particularly PPE, including gowns, masks, and gloves, which are in high demand and short supply.21 Such a shortage of PPE is unprecedented in the wealthiest nation in the world, and it places our physician colleagues and fellow healthcare personnel at great risk on the front lines.",

Our practices have slowly evolved according to the national and international response to this virus. Healthcare meetings have been canceled throughout the summer and fall\u2014with no certainty that any professional conferences will be held for the duration of 2020. In plastic surgery, patients travel domestically and internationally to undergo surgery. As countries close their borders and restrict travel, we can expect a substantial reduction in these patient visits to our offices. Telemedicine offers an alternative to communicate with these patients who seek our care and will likely become a common part of future medical practice. Simultaneously, COVID-19 has destabilized the financial markets. The lasting extent of the damage will depend on the virus\u2019 course, whether we find a cure, and how government aid buffers the downturn. As with the economic recession in 2008, we may find that a substantial portion of patients will lack the disposable income to seek elective plastic surgery. Plastic surgeons will have to evolve and to respond creatively to this change in landscape (Table 5).",
