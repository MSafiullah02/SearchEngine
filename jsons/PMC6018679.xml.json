The study hospitals were located in Takeo province (estimated population 0.9 million) and Kampong Cham province (estimated population 1.7 million), both located approximately 150 km from the capital. The participating hospitals could provide supplementary oxygen, but mechanical or non-invasive ventilation and computed tomography (CT) scan were unavailable. Details of patient recruitment and the methodology have been described elsewhere.9 Patients were eligible if admitted to hospital with symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract infection, defined as onset \u226414 d, fever \u226538\u00b0C or a history of febrile episodes within 3 days and cough and at least one respiratory sign (dyspnoea, chest pain or crackles on lung auscultation) without any hospitalization in the previous 3 weeks and without any known tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active cancer. The decision to hospitalize was left to the clinicians\u2019 judgement. The study was approved by the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health Research (024-NECHR). Written informed consent was obtained from patients \u226518 y of age or the parents/guardians of children.

Inferences about disease outcomes such as death were limited by the large proportion of patients with missing information due to transfer to other health care units. Despite this limitation, our results support previous findings that GNB are associated with worse outcome. Since the ascertainment of comorbidities was insufficient and AST information was lacking for a large proportion of our cohort, we cannot conclude whether the excess mortality could be attributed to the GNB pathogens, to differences in underlying health status or to inappropriate antibiotic treatment.",

First, 28% of the patients with GNB were bacteraemic. Second, specimens were prospectively collected prior to any antibiotic treatment at the hospital. Third, only validated sputum was sent for culture and we used a cut-off of 107 cfu/ml of original sputum. Our study was based on prospectively collected information from two separate geographical regions over a 3-y period. We therefore believe the results are generalizable to the general population in Cambodia.",

Prospective clinical trials comparing empiric treatment algorithms according to the severity of CAP are therefore urgently needed. Given the complex situation, microbiological laboratory capacity needs to be increased and blood and sputum culturing in CAP should be encouraged.",
