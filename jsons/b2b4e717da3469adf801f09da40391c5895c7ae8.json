The presence 166 of an expiratory valve also reduces goggles fogging. [10,11] The nominal protection 167 factor is an important index of a respirator performance. It is measured as the ratio 168 between external concentration of contaminant and its concentration measured on 169 the inner side of the device (Cout/Cin). If we assume Cout to be 1, with Cin = (1 -170 filtration performance), we can easily calculate the nominal protection factor. As an 171 example, a respirator with a 94% filtration performance, will have a nominal 172 protection factor of 16. In this case, the value means that the contaminant is 16 times less concentrated inside the device than in the external environment. Another 174 parameter to be known is the threshold limit value, a threshold level of concentration, 175 specific for each contaminant, which must not be exceeded if the safety of the wearer 176 is to be guaranteed. The real-life protection given by a respirator, in fact, depends on 177 its assigned protection factor, an index that depends on the protection factor provided 178 by the respirator, but also by the ratio between the concentration of the contaminant 179 and its threshold limit value. [11] In the case of some biological contaminants, such 180 as the case of SARS-CoV-2, a threshold limit value is not known, and so the 181 An interesting pilot study has evaluated N95 respirator and medical masks in 288 the setting of home care [30] .

The measurement of workplace protection factor was repeated twice for each participant, one with N95 293 respirator and one with medical mask. N95 respirators provided higher respiratory 294 protection in comparison to medical masks, but the protection factors varied on an 295",

            "text": "assigned protection factor of the respirator remains unknown. However, a reasonable 182 estimate of assigned protection factor, intended as real-life protection guaranteed by 183 the device, can be given by the respirator protection factor or by its filtration 184 performance, if other measures are used to minimize Cout to the farthest level from 185 the threshold limit value. Thus, especially in the context of an unknown contaminant, 186 these concepts and common sense make clear the importance of a safety program 187 including different measures (use of PPE, room ventilation, social distancing, source 188 control). 189 In the cases of insufficient supplies or if required for specific characteristics of 190 contaminant, disposable FFR can be substituted by alternative types of respirators, 191 not usually common in the healthcare settings, such as elastomeric respirators and 192 powered air-supplying respirators. Atmosphere-supplying respirators are intended for 193 particularly hostile environments.194The elastomeric respirators are re-usable devices, made of synthetic materials 195 that can be disinfected and have interchangeable filters.[10,11]  The powered and supplied air respirators are battery-powered reusable 197 respirators composed of hoods or loose-fitting masks, provided with interchangeable 198 and disposable filters, such as high-efficiency particulate air filters. An essential part 199 of the correct use of re-usable PPE, typically used in labs setting, is an accurate 200 cleaning/disinfection procedure. Another device is the atmosphere-supplying 201 respirator, which delivers air to the wearer from an external uncontaminated source.202 This feature becomes relevant in highly toxic environments or in the case of oxygen 203 deficit. Concerns about the clinical use of re-usable PPE are: difficult communication, 204 due to the noise generated by the power-unit, the need for electricity or batteries and 205 the exposure of personnel in charge of disinfection to an additional biological risk. 206 [10,11,15] Healthcare workers should follow their local regulations to select the best 207 device. 208 Viral infections 209 Viruses are frequently causes of occupational infections. Personal protective 210 equipment is considered a pivotal part of safety programs for healthcare personnel at 211 risk of exposure especially when no effective therapies or vaccines are available. 212 [7,16,17] 213 Influenza viruses are among the most commonly studied pathogens. They are 214 RNA viruses and belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Their transmission is mostly 215 mediated by droplets through coughing or sneezing, but also by airborne droplet 216 nuclei or by contact, although the importance of the airborne route is controversial. 217 Coronaviruses share some characteristics with Influenza viruses, such as RNA 218 genome. They belong to the Coronaviridae family, known as cause of common cold, 219 but also of other respiratory tract infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Their transmission happens through large droplets or by touching 221 contaminated surfaces and fomites, with uncertainties about airborne route. [18] A 222 recent study has detected NL63, OC43 and HKU1 coronaviruses RNA in airborne 223 droplets nuclei contained in four participants' exhaled breaths, out of ten samples. 224 [19] 225 The recent pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has 226 pushed the scientific community to a better understanding of the transmission routes. 227 To date, the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reasonably caused by 228 respiratory large droplets and contact route, but data are insufficient to exclude 229 airborne droplet nuclei transmission. [20] 230 Inward protection: protecting the wearer from the environment 231 Filtering facepiece respirators provide inward protection, defined as the 232 capacity to reduce the concentration of airborne particles from the environment to the 233 inner side of the device that is in contact with the upper airways of the wearer. Their 234 protection consists of limiting the inhalational transmission of droplets and aerosols, 235 potentially containing pathogens. While FFR are specifically produced for this 236 purpose, medical masks are registered as medical apparel, for general protection of 237 the wearer. [10,11] Moreover, respirators are more expensive than medical masks 238 and healthcare facilities do not usually have stockpiles, thus creating more interest 239 about the detailed differences among these devices, especially during epidemics or 240 pandemics. 241 The most recent indications of World Health Organization (WHO) about the 242 use of PPE during COVID-19 pandemic, recommend the use of respirator N95 or 243 equivalent FFP2 only in the context of aerosol-generating procedures performed on patients with COVID-19, while medical masks are recommended for the general care 245 of patients with COVID-19 provided that they are wearing a medical mask. [21] 246 Aerosol-generating procedures are currently intended for cardiopulmonary 247 resuscitation, tracheal intubation or suction, tracheotomy, manipulation of oxygen 248 masks, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation or, although controversial, use of high 249 flow nasal cannula. [21,22,23] Worth noting, collecting diagnostic respiratory samples 250 (e.g. nasopharyngeal swab) should be considered as aerosol-generating procedures, 251 because it can cause coughing and/or sneezing. Thus, the healthcare worker in 252 charge for these procedures should wear FFR. [7] 253 In its latest technical report, The European Center of Diseases Control 254 (ECDC) stated that healthcare workers in contact with a suspected or confirmed 255 COVID-19 case should wear a medical mask or, if available an FFP2 respirator. [7] 256 Most of the evidence about the use of PPE in viral infections is based on 257 Influenza models. Despite the known similarities in term of transmission, they should 258 be considered with caution in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A recent 259 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of N95 respirators 260 versus medical masks for the prevention of influenza. It included six randomized 261 clinical trials for a total of 9171 participants. No significant differences were found 262 between the use of N95 respirators and medical masks for the outcomes of 263 laboratory confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), 264 laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28), laboratory-confirmed 265 respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) or influenza like illness (RR = 266 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14). One of the trials included was actually done in a household 267 setting. The authors concluded suggesting that N95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and healthcare workers performing low-risk 269 procedures. [24] 270 Specific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing. A randomized 271 multicentre controlled trial (NCT04296643) in Canada is underway to compare the 272 use of either medical masks or N95 respirator in 576 nurses involved in the care of 273 patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome is laboratory confirmed COVID-19 274 among the participants. 275 In addition to FFR, a PPE ensemble usually includes boots, gowns, gloves, 276 hoods and goggles or face-shield. [21] These components seem to provide an 277 additional inward protection, despite the amount of extra protection given by goggles 278 or face-shield remaining controversial, especially in the case of lengthy exposure to 279 airborne droplet nuclei. [25] 280 For household settings, WHO has recommended the use of medical masks, 281 gowns, gloves and eye protection for healthcare workers providing home care to 282 patients with COVID-19, and medical masks for both caregivers and patients. [21,26] 283 Literature exists about the use of masks in household setting, but showing no 284 significant reductions in household transmission, except for some benefit in the case 285 of early application after the onset of the index patient's symptoms. These findings 286 may be partially explained by the lack of compliance with the intervention. [27,28,29] 287",

The role of medical masks for the source control of 320 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is controversial. A recent study showed a lower 321 seasonal coronavirus RNA detection rate in droplets and aerosol samples collected 322 from participants wearing a medical mask, compared to participants not wearing a 323 mask. [19] In contrast with these findings, a study has been conducted on four 324 patients with COVID-19 invited to cough onto a petri dish. Each participant repeated 325 the experiment with no mask, a medical mask and a cotton-mask. Differences in 326 SARS-CoV-2 viral loads on the petri dishes were not significant across the 327 combinations and the virus was detected on the external surfaces of the masks, thus 328 demonstrating a potentially insufficient outward protection. [34] 329 Lack of supplies and re-use 330 The tragic conditions of a pandemic can increase the demand for PPE, 331 potentially exceeding its availability. On 19 th of March 2020, WHO confirmed that 332 \"The current global stockpile of PPE is insufficient, particularly for medical masks and 333 respirators; the supply of gowns and goggles is soon expected to be insufficient 334 also\", as already stated also in the precedent versions of its document 'Interim 335 guidance on COVID-19'. [21] 336 WHO has recommended an extended use of PPE, i.e wearing the same 337 respirator for repeated close contacts in the case of cohorted patients with COVID-338 19. [21] However, no recommendations were released about the re-use or 339 decontamination of disposable PPE. The hypothesis of the re-use has been evaluated by several bench studies over time and interesting data about residual 341 efficacy and performance post decontamination of disposable respirators are 342 available. 343 The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has provided a summary 344 of the evidence available on decontamination procedure of disposable FFR. It is 345 clearly stated that the use of a decontaminated FFR should be a part of a crisis 346 capacity strategy. Vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and 347 moist heat are listed among the methods that may preserve filtering performance. A 348 recommendation is made against the use of autoclave, 160\u00b0C dry heat, 70% 349 isopropyl alcohol, microwave irradiation, bleach and soap and water, because they 350 could affect the filtering performance.

This is of outmost important during aerosol-393 generating procedures, especially airway management, which should be performed 394 by the most skilled available operators. [45] The downside of this approach is the 395 reduced exposure of junior doctors to these procedures. This phenomenon has been 396 already observed during SARS outbreak, and continued in the immediate post-397 outbreak periods, with concerns about training quality and preparedness of young 398 personnel in the management of future similar situations. [41] 399 Finally, although equipped with protective clothing and even being 400 experienced for the required tasks, healthcare workers can also be contaminated by 401 improper removal of PPE, [46] thus regular training should be implemented to 402 guarantee the best protection. Filtering facepiece respirators should be removed after 403 the removal of the other components of PPE, just before removing of the gloves. The 404 anterior part should not be touched during removal. [47] It is important to note 405 doffing is done at the end of a shift, when an already fatigued worker can easily make 406 mistakes during the procedure. A lot of human and organizational risk factors can co-407 exist, and appropriate knowledge of the procedure, plus the presence of a doffing 408 partner are suggested. 409 CONCLUSIONS 410 In general, clinical evidence on the use of FFR is poor. The use of appropriate 411 care of patients with viral infections, such as the currently pandemic, COVID-19. 413 Unfortunately, supplies are rapidly running out worldwide. Moreover, knowledge 414 about specific characteristics of FFR is of utmost importance to select the proper type 415 according to the clinical setting. Direct evidence on the effectiveness of FFR in the 416 prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection is low and still underway, with concerns about 417 the generalizability of other virus models. Available literature seems to reflect the 418 alternating of periods of peak interest, coinciding with epidemics, with periods of lack 419 of interest towards the topic. There should be a more constant research effort which 420 also addresses the need for periodical training of healthcare workers. surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and 506 meta-analysis.

They 143 are differently labelled on the basis of their filtration properties and of the national 144 regulations defining the standard conditions they were tested at [14]. As an example, 145 the European label 'FFP2' refers to a respirator able to reduce a specific aerosol 146 concentration of at least 94%, while 'FFP3' corresponds to a filtration performance of 147 at least 99%. National regulatory standards have similarities around the world and 148 recommendations usually refer to a specific class and its foreign equivalent models. Examples of FFP2 equivalents are N95 (United States), KN95 (China), P2 150 (Australia/New Zealand), DS (Japan) and Korea 1st class (Korea). 151 Worth noting, FFR are tested at a high flow-rate (85-95 L/min) and with test 152 aerosol of around 0.3-0.5\u03bcm in diameter. As a consequence, their real-life 153 performances should be better than the tested one. Filtering performance strongly 154 depends on fitting, and healthcare workers should test different devices to find the 155 best fitting model and size for their face. Filtering face-piece respirators are not 156 intended to be one-size-fits-all. For example, the presence of a beard can alter the 157 sealing, and shaving is required. A fit test with an indicator aerosol should be used to 158 evaluate the presence of leakages and to confirm the choice of the respirator model 159",
