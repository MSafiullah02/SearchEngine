Although there is evidence that dopamine exposure is associated with ICA during the first days of life,4,5 understanding of this association continues to be limited. The effect of different dopamine doses on cerebral autoregulation has not been well studied, but research suggests percent time spent with impaired autoregulation increases with higher doses of dopamine.15 In addition, cerebral autoregulation may remain impaired despite a restoration of blood pressure in response to dopamine, suggesting that dopamine exposure may play a role in this impairment independent of blood pressure.4 This study aims to test the hypothesis that dopamine is associated with ICA in a dose-dependent fashion.",

However, these subjects were significantly more likely to have a higher SNAPPE-II illness severity score, were exposed to high-frequency ventilation, had severe (grades 3 and 4) IVH, and have increased mortality, suggesting a higher acuity in this population. Although it is difficult to determine if the effect on autoregulation is due to dopamine therapy vs. general instability of the subject, we used methods to evaluate data at the time point level while accounting for clustering at the patient level and controlling for severity scoring, blood pressure, and other factors to minimize this influence. In addition, previous studies have also noted an association between dopamine and adverse outcomes even when controlling for patient severity factors.2,18,19 Severe grade IVH was not found to significantly affect the relationship between dopamine titration and ICA. This may be due to the possibility that IVH occurs secondary to ICA. Previously, studies have shown that ICA may precede the development of severe grade IVH;10,13 in addition, it has been shown that dopamine exposure may lead to pressure passive blood flow despite restoration of blood pressure leaving patients vulnerable to reperfusion injury.4",

Inconsistencies may stem from the fact that the response of the premature infant to dopamine is mediated by receptor maturational differences and downregulation, and adrenal insufficiency.23 This uncertainty and concern for changes to cerebral hemodynamics independent of blood pressure underscores the need for close monitoring and maintenance of blood pressure within a tight range during dopamine exposure.",

This may be secondary to a number of factors. In general, the dose response of dopamine is stimulation of dopaminergic receptors (2\u20134 \u03bcg/kg/min), followed by \u03b2-receptor stimulation (5\u201310 \u03bcg/kg/min), and finally followed by \u03b1-receptor stimulation (11\u201320 \u03bcg/kg/min). In premature infants, due to GA differences in \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor expression, the stimulation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors may be noted at lower titrations than \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation,23 potentially leading to maximal \u03b1-receptor-mediated autoregulatory changes in the mid-range titration. In an animal model,24 it was found that autoregulatory capacity increased as dopamine dosage was increased above 20 \u03bcg/kg/min, but expected improvements in cerebral blood flow or oxygenation were not noted. Cerebral artery myogenic tone may also be biphasic with vasodilation at lower dopamine concentrations and vasoconstriction noted at higher concentrations.25 In addition, we speculate that the severity of illness when requiring high doses of dopamine leads to the addition of other medications, such as additional inotropes and hydrocortisone, fluid resuscitation, and blood products exposure, all of which may affect the autoregulatory threshold. In this cohort, 11 subjects were treated with these additional interventions; however, the relatively small number of infants and multiple interventions limits our ability to analyze the specific effects of interventions such as steroids on cerebral autoregulation in this study.",

The single center design and lack of a standard approach to vasopressor initiation may limit the generalizability of this study. Some of the subjects enrolled were exposed to dopamine prior to enrollment, which did not allow for a before-during-after temporal assessment of dopamine in relation to cerebral autoregulation. In addition, although we controlled for patient illness severity and other potential confounders, we acknowledge that there may be multiple factors contributing to ICA that were not accounted for such as carbon dioxide levels, oxygen requirement, sedation exposure, treatment with steroids, and so on. Furthermore, the half-life of dopamine is not well known, although research has suggested that it may be between 2.5 and 6.9 min.26,27 Other factors that may have an effect on dopamine clearance such as infant\u2019s GA, postnatal age, dopamine dose, and changes in infusion rate have not been well studied. Since it is possible that the half-life dopamine is shorter than each 10-min epoch, it is unclear how changes in dopamine dose before and during each epoch could affect cerebral autoregulation. More robust studies into time to steady state and clearance of dopamine need to be completed to better understand its effect on dopamine and cerebral autoregulation.",
