An SEIR compartment model is considered with additional compartments of hospitalized population whose condition is severe or critical and also the fatalities compartment. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is computed by next generation matrix approach and later expressed as a time-dependent function so as to incorporate the NPIs into the model. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved using fourth-order and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Different intervention scenarios are considered and results show that, implementation of closure of education insitutions, curfew and partial lockdown yield predicted delayed peaks of the overall infections, severe cases and fatalities and subsequently containement of the pandemic in the country.",

The WHO report, details the chrolonology of how Wuhan in Hubei Province in China became a global epicenter of COVID-19 with the epidemiological link to the Huanan Seafood wet markets where there was sale of live animals. Over the period, COVID-19 has infected close to 3 million people worldwide with close to 200,000 fatalities reported, necessitating the WHO to declare it a pandemic. With no viable vaccine at the moment, COVID-19 has initiated efforts focussed on containement and strategies aimed at reducing infections and fatalities. On the global platform, there has been a furor of activity in determining the best strategy in containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A host of countries have insituted interventions not limited to social distancing, curfews and total lockdowns. In [3] , a model taking into consideration Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network was implemented, where reproduction numbers (R O ) were computed to determine the transmissibility of the virus between people and reservoirs. The value of R O of reservoir to people was found to be 2.30 while people to people was 3.5. In [11] , they delved into mathematical models of the COVID-19 and with a reproduction number of 2, they considered an SEI model to model the effects of local social gatherings. With a 14-day infectious period, the model showed that with 18 hours exposure, the attendees of the event had a protection efficacy of 70%. In [8] , a conceptual SEIR model to gauge the effects of individual reaction and goverment reactions was investigated. This was in line with Chinese government implementation of social distancing measures in areas considered as epicenters. The model incorporated zoonotic introductions and emigrations and showed that close relations with reported cases, even though asymptomatic transmission could not be established. In Ontario, Canada, [13] implemented a mathematical model for transmission and mitigation strategies. They considered measures taken in the population which included quarantine, isolation of infectious cases and hospitalization with intensive case unit (ICU) cases. It was reported that in absence of substantial physical social distancing and enhanced case detection and isolation , the ICU resources will be quickly overwhelmed. In [1] , considered a model for prediction of new cases ad made a comparison study of United States of America, India and Italy. Different scenarions under physical distancing measures such as lockdown were considered and predictions were made using the available data. It was reported that, without mitigation of physical interaction of the populations, the peaks of infections will be realised much earlier in all the three countries.",

In [12] , they use an agestructured SIR model with social contact matrices from surveys and Bayesian imputation to gauge the spread of COVID-19 epidemic in India, where they use a generalization of the time dependent R O case study data, age distribution and social contact structure. Their predictions implore on the duration of social distancing mitigation such lockdowns and give scope of when periodic ease of the lockdowns can be implemented. Further age-structured morbidity and mortality is reduced on implementation of these measures. [5] investigated a more complex variant of the SEIR referred to as \u03b8-SEIHRD model to take into account the undetected infections and based their study in China. Their study showed that mitigation measures of limiting physical contact decrease the basic reproduction number and subsequently a reduction in infections. Further brisk detection is needed in order to reduce the number of infections. In [6] , results of social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic are presented. They simulate the reduction of reproduction numbers as a result of social distancing measures. In [7] , an important parameter referred to as the identification parameter is included in the simulations to predict the peaks of the epidemic in Japan. This parameter is the ratio between the positive cases to the number of tests performed. Further they used available date and the least-square based procedure with Poisson noise to estimate the infection rate as a function of the identification rate and they consider an SEIR compartmental model. They report that, interventions have a positive effect in delaying the peak of the epidemic and they propose longer interventions to contain the epidemic.",

They forecasted the potential incidence rate and magnitude of the epidemic using observed growth rate and age-distribution of confirmed cases in China. They reported that the number of the infected cases is likely to be high and that isolation of the asymptomatic infectious population will not be enough measure. Further they proposed exceptional social distancing to 'flatten the curve' and caution on the expected rebound of infections when the restrictions are lifted. In [9] , an SEIR model was implemented taking into consideration the population's interaction with the enviroment. This was achieved by considering the enviroment as the host of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

In order to simulate and predict infection cases from the model, we use the framework developed by [7] . In this case it is assumed only a fraction of the infected individuals are identified by the diagnosis.

The model's equation 2.2 that are solved using a fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta method, which is implemented in MATLAB. We consider N = 4.76 \u00d7 10 7 people which is Kenya's total population as per the 2019 census. The simulations are done using the parameters listed in Table (1) . The human-human contact reduction measures we consider are school closedown, dusk to dawn curfew and partial lockdowns in towns and cities perceived as COVID-19 hotspots. The essence of contact reduction is to mitigate the interaction between the susceptible and infectious populations. Based on studies of COVID-19 spread in China, Italy, and Spain, we suppose that if no mitigation measures are in place then an infectious individual would infect three secondary cases, in his/her interaction sphere. Thus we consider the R 0 as 3, for the unmitigated scenario. The first case of the novel corona virus was confirmed in Kenya on 13th March, 2020. On 16th March 2020, schools were closed, which was the first NPI that was implemented by the Kenyan government. Then 14 days into the school closedown, curfew measures were implemented. Thereafter 24 days into school closedown, partial lockdown was implemented. In our simulations, we implement the school closure for 210 days, curfew for 196 days, and partial lockdown for 186 days. This is done via a timedependent Ro, which was taken as a cosine function, see [6] . We presume that school closure yields a 20% reduction in contact while adding a curfew on to the school closure results to a 40% reduction, and introduction of the partial lockdown on to the other two NPIs yields a 60% reduction in contacts as shown in Figure 3. 9 .

In particular, we see a much higher peak of infections in the unmitigated scenario, which arrives much faster due to the high rate of infections when R 0 =3.0. For the first two NPIs the infections peaks are lower and come at a later date. When all the three NPIs are combined, resulting to a R 0 of 1.2, the infections peak at a much lower value and the epidemic begins to subside. However, this leaves a large population in the susceptible compartment such that when the value of R 0 begins to rise, towards the end of the NPI duration, a rebound of infections occurs. Due to the effectiveness of the combined NPIs the new peak is much lower and the epidemic is eradicated. The measures results to a reduction in the cumulative number of infections, see Figure  4b . Combining all the three NPIs leads to a significant delay of the epidemic spread, a time the health system can utilize to put mechanisms and facilities to respond to the epidemic appropriately.",

Relaxation of the mitigation measures on or before September 2020 will likely lead to a resurgence and the country may experience a new wave of infections. Devoid of the aftershocks of these interventions, the country will have no infections as at 31st December 2020.",
