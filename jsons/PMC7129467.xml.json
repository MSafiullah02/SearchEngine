            "text": "Adult T-cell leukemia\u2013lymphoma (ATL) is a kind of peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [1]. It is classified into four categories (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types) depending on clinical features [2]. ATL is often resistant to chemotherapies, thus resulting in poor prognosis [3]. Since ATL per se induces severe impairment of cellular immunity, ATL patients are susceptible to opportunistic infections by cytomegalovirus (CMV), candida, Pneumocystis jirovecci, and Strongyloides stercoralis\n[4]. Mogamulizumab is a promising, brand-new therapeutic option for ATL. This agent binds C\u2013C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) protein abundantly expressed in membrane surface of ATL cells, thereby activating natural killer cells in a manner of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [5]. In patients treated with mogamulizumab, median progression-free survival and overall survival intervals were 5.2 and 13.7 months, respectively [5]. On the other hand, its profile of robust cytotoxicity would be problematic in some cases. In fact, it has been suggested that mogamulizumab increases the risk of reactivation of CMV and hepatitis B virus [6], [7].",

Therefore, combined regimens with VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone), AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone), and VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone) were started as an induction chemotherapy. Soon after the third course of VCAP\u2013AMP\u2013VECP therapies were finished, the number of circulating lymphocytes and ATL cells, LDH and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were unfortunately increased rapidly, suggesting that his status was turned to refractory phase.",

Before the treatment, the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and ATL cells in the peripheral blood was 2849/\u03bcL, 10,780/\u03bcL, and 847/\u03bcL, respectively. On day 2 after induction of mogamulizumab, ATL cells disappeared in the peripheral blood, and the number of lymphocytes was rapidly decreased to 460/\u03bcL, accompanied by the prolongation of severe lymphopenia (grade 3\u20134) (Fig. 1\n). Despite prophylactic medication had been administered with levofloxacin (LVFX), itraconazole (ITCZ), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and acyclovir (ACV), he suffered from infectious complications including CMV antigenemia, gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and aspergillosis during the clinical course. Although these infections were well controlled by the broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment, multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs, an atypical pattern of bacterial pneumonia, were appeared and gradually worsened. Due to acute respiratory failure, he died on day 48 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). Since chest CT showed typical patterns of viral pneumonia (Fig. 2), the peripheral blood was collected premortally and examined with multiplex PCR kit (Seeplex RV15 OneStep ACE Detection, Seegene, South Korea), which can screen most CRVs including influenza virus A/B, human adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus A/B/C, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus A/B, bocavirus 1/2/3/4, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus [11].

LRTI due to HPIV occurred in 13%\u201343% in patients with leukemia and HSCT recipients, and its mortality rate was 12\u201350% [15]. The most important risk factor for progression to LRTI is lymphopenia. Although the thresholds vary according to studies, lymphocyte count less than 200/\u03bcL is accepted as the guideline [8], [13]. In the present case, prolongation of severe lymphopenia less than 200/\u03bcL was considered as the possible main cause to develop fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1.",

Generally, interstitial infiltrates including multifocal distribution of ground-glass opacities suggest viral pneumonia [17], [18], [19]. Regarding HPIV pneumonia, a recent study showed that tree-in-bud opacities reflecting bronchiolitis were the most common finding (67%) followed by bronchial wall thickening (38%) and ground-glass opacities (38%) [20]. Although the typical tree-in-bud opacities were not observed in the present case, centrilobular nodules suggesting bronchiolitis were observed on day 32, and the findings were worsened to diffuse patchy ground-glass opacities over the clinical course (Fig. 2). Thus, CT images observed in this patient were consistent with the previous report of HPIV pneumonia.",

However, it was technically difficult to detect HPIV-1 in the lung because RNA is generally unstable and long-term fixation with formalin and paraffin should be cruel condition for RNA virus including HPIV-1. We finally diagnosed HPIV-1 pneumonia based on a line of evidence as listed below; 1) HPIV-1 was detected in the blood, 2) CT images were consistent with viral pneumonia, and 3) pathological findings suggested RNA viral infection in the lung.",
