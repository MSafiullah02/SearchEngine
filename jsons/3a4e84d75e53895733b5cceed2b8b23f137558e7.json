No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. Method: In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. Result: The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was \u22121.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6-24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2\u221243.0. Conclusion: The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.",

Clinical manifestations consist of: 1 fever or respiratory symptoms; 2. characteristic lung imaging changes [2] . 3. The total number of white blood cells is normal or decreases in the early stage of onset, or the lymphocyte count decreases. The diagnostic criteria for suspected cases comply with any one of the epidemiological history and any two of the clinical manifestations. A suspected case with one of the following pathogenic evidence refers to a confirmed case: 1. PCR tests of COVID-19 nucleic acid positive for respiratory specimens or blood specimens [4] . 2. Respiratory or blood specimen virus gene sequencing is significantly homologous with known COVID-19 [2] .
