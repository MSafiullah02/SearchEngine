            "text": "The concept of therapeutic mobilities, coined by Gatrell (2013), has grown out of a development of research within health geography into therapeutic landscapes; places that are seen to contribute to improved health and wellbeing. Literature on therapeutic landscapes has enriched understandings of the health impacts of places, with detailed descriptions of the healing benefits of iconic sites, such as the Sanctuary of Lady Lourdes in France (Gesler, 1996) as well as more everyday settings, such as parks (Laumann et al., 2001) and gardens (Pitt, 2014). However, the recent \u2018mobilities turn\u2019 has helped develop research that moves from a focus on fixed sites, towards the role of everyday movements through places that can contribute to wellbeing (Doughty, 2013). This emerging body of research focuses largely on the restorative power of mobility to convey the idea that mobility, as well as place, can contribute to improved health and wellbeing.",

            "text": "There has been increasing research into the therapeutic qualities of landscapes (Marcus, 2018; Rose, 2012) and into the value of shared walking in greenspace (Barton et al., 2009; Doughty, 2013) and bluespace (Pasanen et al., 2019). Such research indicates that shared walking through therapeutic landscapes can improve social interaction, boost mental wellbeing and enhance quality of life. Other studies have examined the downsides to walking, for instance when it is stressful or burdensome when walking with small children (Bostock, 2001) or in unsafe neighbourhoods (Green, 2009). Yet, further research that explores the unfavourable qualities of shared walking is required to examine the downsides of shared walking in different contexts (Hanson et al., 2016). This paper explores how group walking may negatively influence wellbeing in later life, and contributes to a richer understanding of the relationship between the two. In literature that focuses on places and landscapes, scholars such as Conradson (2005) and Cummins et al. (2007) have critiqued the assumption that certain environments create an inherently therapeutic experience and argue for a relational approach to place and wellbeing. As Conradson (2005, p, 338) states, \u2018individuals clearly experience even scenic environments in quite different ways, in terms ranging from enjoyment through to ambivalence and even anxiety\u2019. In this study, I argue that presumptions that group walking has intrinsically beneficial influences on wellbeing requires a relational approach that emphasises subjective experience.",

Nevertheless, the widespread promotion of walking groups for older people downplays the possible detrimental impacts of shared walking to health and wellbeing and thus portrays a largely romanticised view of group walking. Walking groups are often prescribed as a way to improve health, without considering the individual issues of older adults, and shared walking in older age is rarely spatially nor relationally understood. For instance, health professionals may not appreciate where people walk and the impacts of this on a person's wellbeing, as well as who they walk with or encounter and how this impacts on their wellbeing. Moreover, \u2018simply exhorting individuals to walk more or expose themselves to greenery is insufficient\u2019 (Carpenter, 2013, p, 124) and the individual, detrimental impacts of walking groups should not be overlooked.",

The austerity measures of the UK government, as well as the previous \u2018Big Society\u2019 agenda, has seen responsibility for health and wellbeing shift from local authorities to communities and individuals (Lowndes and Pratchett, 2012). Cuts to government funding have resulted in the closure or reduction of many public services for older people, such as day centres, meals-on-wheels and home-care support (Age UK, 2015), therefore older adults are being encouraged to take a greater responsibility for their health and wellbeing to ensure they are leading active and healthy lives (Kuh et al., 2014). This promotion and increase of self-responsibility for older people may mean that the detrimental qualities of physical activities are overlooked. Furthermore, there is a need to examine whether older individuals are reaping the benefits that they are assumed to gain from walking groups.",

I am a young white woman, living in Southampton, with experience of interviewing older people. When asking participants questions about their age and health, I was acutely aware of the social difference between myself and the participants. This was especially because of prevalent ageism which often dichotomises younger people as independent and older people as dependent (Angus and Reeve, 2006). I was therefore wary that my position as a healthy young person may have influenced participants\u2019 responses concerning the benefits they gain from group membership and about how healthy their lifestyles are. However, I share both an interest in walking and a similar socio-economic status with most of the participants and I also reside in Southampton. I thus experienced a simultaneous fluidity in my insider/outsider status, sharing some lived experiences with the participants but having a large age difference (Couture et al., 2012). Subsequently, I took a reflexive approach throughout the whole research process, recognising that my positionality may influence the data collection process, as well as the analysis of the findings (Hellawell, 2006).",

I then joined each walking group on their walk, and it was during these walks that ten of the members expressed their willingness to be part of the study. All ten interviews were walking interviews and participants chose to either undertake the walking interview at the same time as one of the walking groups \u2013 but walking further behind the group \u2013 or on a different day altogether. Five of the participants decided to arrange their walking interview for the same time and route as the walking group, thus I was also involved in participating in the walking groups, which allowed for a deeper ethnographic understanding of how these groups function. Each interview lasted approximately thirty to fifty minutes and was audio-recorded. Participants were asked questions about how and why they came to join the walking group, the benefits they gain from the walking group and any issues they have with the walking group.

Although the sample size is small, the depth of the narrative data I uncovered satisfied my study's aims and as a lone researcher on a limited timescale, the sample size of ten self-volunteered participants was also suitable in practical terms.",

Accordingly, the benefits of walking interviews should not be over-emphasised or thought to be without problems, an assumption labelled by Macpherson (2016) as a \u2018methodological orthodoxy\u2019. This concept explains that only noting the positives of walking interviews means that the cultural contexts and diverse circumstances in which participants walk are ignored. Walking interviews do not simply reveal how people respond to the environment, but they create certain socio-natural knowledge and spaces. Implying that walking interviews undoubtedly create somehow more authentic data is therefore misleading (ibid). Talking whilst walking is thought to allow people to express their feelings more openly than if sat directly opposite someone, and walking interviews have been celebrated for enhancing rapport between participants and researchers (Ward-Thompson, 2012).

The increase in self-responsibility of older adults to maintain their health and wellbeing has been regarded as exclusionary in terms of socio-economic class (Cardona, 2008). The demographic makeup of this study's sample may reflect this, as all participants describe themselves as middle-class and White-British. Hanson and Jones (2015a) refer to the \u2018inverse prevention law\u2019 whereby preventative interventions, such as walking groups, are likely to be less successful in areas where interventions are most needed.

It is particularly useful for exploring the perspectives of different research participants, emphasising similarities and differences, and uncovering unexpected insights, which are pertinent to my research aims (ibid; King, 2004). I followed Braun and Clarke's (2006) six guidelines for thematic analysis. Firstly, I transcribed the data verbatim and familiarised myself with the data through re-reading. After, I created initial codes from the data using nVivo version 12 software. These were codes that were interesting and meaningful to my research aims (Braun and Clarke, 2006). The codes were then collated into potential themes which I reviewed, and I produced a thematic map which best represented the data and was supported by codes and the relationships between them (Clarke and Braun, 2014). At this stage, some themes, such as \u2018importance of nature\u2019 and \u2018healthy ageing\u2019 remained closely related to the therapeutic landscapes and therapeutic mobilities literatures. However, my thematic map also included many interpretive themes, such as \u2018lack of integration\u2019 and \u2018personal comparisons\u2019 that had been inductively generated. Thus, the focus on detrimental mobilities emerged more inductively during the data collection, analysis and as the study unfolded. I decided to focus this paper on the themes which showed the detrimental aspects of the walking groups because these were more interesting, meaningful and these findings add to literature that explores the unfavourable qualities of shared walking in different contexts (Bostock, 2001; Green, 2009; Hanson et al., 2016). Finally, I selected extract examples and produced a narrative summary. In text, where participants are referred to, pseudonyms are used and the participants' age stated after.",

Nielson et al.'s (2019) research into social exclusion in an urban retirement village also found similar lines of inclusion/exclusion and these researchers found that being part of the retirement village did not give residents automatic entry to a social group. Likewise, being part of a walking group does not necessarily give all members automatic entry to the social cliques of the group.

Moreover, while sociality is important in the creating of therapeutic mobilities (Doughty, 2013), lack of sociality is also important in creating detrimental mobilities. Likewise, just as engaging in supportive social environments is beneficial for combatting social isolation, engaging in unsupportive social environments, and feeling excluded or rejected, is damaging for social wellbeing. Furthermore, it is important to note that this research did not include the voices of those who perhaps feel so excluded that they no longer attend the walking groups or feel so excluded that they have not joined.

During the interview, both Eileen and Janet walked slow and paid close attention to where we were walking. The routes they chose were simple and short, and they stuck to the main paths of Southampton Common. However, the main paths were not always stuck to by the walking groups, and Eileen explained that if the route of the walking group crossed some of the other terrains of Southampton Common, such as the rough grassland or the woodland, she would often head straight to the caf\u00e9 to wait for the other walkers to finish the walk, rather than walking with them.

Yet, for those at the back of the group, who perhaps, like Eileen, cannot walk as fast, these built-in halts do not provide any rest and could in fact pressure some members into walking faster in order to catch up. Eileen's story highlights an issue of universally prescribing walking groups with the view that they are inherently restorative and relaxing in the same ways for all (Carpenter, 2013). The pressure that members feel to maintain the pace of the group could also have relevance to other group activities, such as cycling groups, long-distance swimmers or park-runners, where the therapeutic experience depends on one keeping pace with a group. Therefore, assuming that shared mobility is valuable to people in the same ways overlooks the nuances between mobility and wellbeing, and the diverse ways in which shared walking is experienced by individuals.",

For instance, Eileen was no slower or less able to walk on uneven surfaces than other members when she joined the group eight years ago, and even for participants such as Jean, a time may come when they feel their social interaction with the group is sufficient for them to feel more relaxed and less lonely. Their accounts emphasise the relationality of the concepts of detrimental and therapeutic mobilities, as changes to an individual's socio-natural engagement and personal circumstances can influence the power of walking to impact positively or negatively on one's health and wellbeing. Changing capacities, especially in older age, impact on the influences of external factors, such as one's socio-environment, thus recommendations for certain group activities must acknowledge the temporal nature of experiences and wellbeing impacts. In uncovering stories about participants' experiences of exclusion and discomfort, it is shown that ideals of walking groups (and other group activities) as beneficial in the same ways for all need re-evaluating. Furthermore, there is a need for promoters of walking groups to have a better understanding of the lived experiences of walking group members because the micro-practices and the range of experiences of members can get overlooked in sweeping statements surrounding shared walking and health.",

Taken together, the findings from this study complicate the boundaries between positive and negative therapeutic experiences and the assumption that membership in a walking group is entirely advantageous. These participants are members of the same walking group, therefore health professionals may presume that they each experience the walking group in a similar way and that they all draw the same healing benefits from each walk (Carpenter, 2013). Their experiences emphasise the importance of examining mobilities at an individual level, and with a relational approach that recognises the interplay of people and place. The findings promote viewing mobility through a detrimental mobilities lens, so that mobility is approached critically, rather than seeing mobility as fundamentally positive, or indeed inherently negative.

The focus of this paper has only been on shared walking as a form of mobility and the findings are based on a small self-selected sample, thus they cannot represent the experiences of all older adults in walking groups. This paper does not seek to disregard the notion that shared walking through greenspace is therapeutic or beneficial to health, but instead seeks to emphasise that shared mobility also has the potential to be detrimental to wellbeing. The impacts of shared mobility, and to a degree community and sociability, on health and wellbeing should therefore not be romanticised.
