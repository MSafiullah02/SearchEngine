Both trials were non-comparative single arm trials, and, in both trials, 84-89% patients had early T-stage disease (T1/T2) and only 16% had >N2b disease and the long-term results of these studies are still awaited to make any firm conclusions. Authors of one of the other trials [2] stated that small sample size impaired analysis of the statistical significance of acute toxicity between the 2 groups of patients receiving 54Gy and 69.3Gy. Other studies showed, patient reported acute toxicity scores consistently higher than clinician reported scores [8.9], and the question also arises whether 2-year progression free survival is an adequate measurement endpoint? None of the eight trials under examination reviewed differences in late toxicity, secondary to de-intensification.",

There is evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA can be detected in the plasma of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma [12] and that plasma circulating tumor human papillomavirus DNA in two consecutive plasma samples during post-treatment surveillance has a high positive predictive value and negative predictive value, for identifying disease recurrence in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer and may facilitate earlier initiation of salvage therapy [13]. Whether viral load at the time of diagnosis can help risk stratification of patients for de- or intensification remains a question. The potential for utilising serological markers to predict suitability of patients for treatment de-intensification may have a role in future studies.",

Reduction of toxicity while preserving anti-tumour efficiency of treatment is a laudable aim but it is important to remember that HNC is a relatively treatment resistant group of malignancies, unlike for example some lymphomas where a significant reduction in total radiotherapy dose has allowed the reduction in treatment morbidity while maintaining very similar survival targets. This is not always the case in head and neck cancer and an example of this is the quoted De-ESCALaTE study [7], where toxicity was similar between cisplatin and cetuximab, but the cetuximab arm showed worse 2-year survival and had higher two-year recurrence rates. Although starting with equipoise, some patients appeared to have died because they went into the study rather than had standard of care treatment.",

This emphasises the need for full discussion and information giving to patients so that they can make an informed decision about entering a de-escalation trial, knowing there may be a less chance of cure than if they had a standard of care treatment outside of a trial. This is even more important in present COVID-19 era, where radiotherapy hypofractionation regimens, and reduced or abandoned concomitant chemotherapy regimens, are being introduced [16], for the best possible motives, to reduce hospital visits and potential immunosuppression, but in general without input from individual patients or patient groups. It should be remembered that advanced HNC can kill patients as well as COVID, and some of the patients may wish to accept a potential risk from contracting coronavirus, while keeping their chances of cure for HNC as high as possible. The case fatality rates in younger age groups have been reported as quite low; 0.32% (95%CI 0.25 \u2013 0.41%) for 20 \u2013 49 years, 1.3% (95%CI 1.1 \u2013 1.5%) for age 50 \u2013 59 years and 3.6% (95%CI 3.2 \u2013 4.0%) for age group 60 \u2013 69 years [17].",
