Influenza A virus possesses eight negative single-stranded RNA segments that encode eleven proteins (HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, NEP, PA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2) and is subtyped by 16 HA and nine NA envelope proteins [1]. A novel influenza A (H1N1) virus first isolated in North America has been a major global focus since April 2009, spreading to 74 countries, infecting more than 35,000 people, and causing 163 related deaths to date [4]. Genetic study has suggested that this new H1N1 virus contains a unique combination of gene segments from both North American and Eurasian swine lineages, of which PB2, PA, PB1, HA, NP, and NS are derived from North American swine lineage (triple reassortant), and the NA and M are derived from Eurasian swine lineage [5]. Simply put, this new H1N1 virus exhibits an obviously complicated gene segment reassortment of previous prevalent virus strains [6], [7], [8], [9].",

Although this virus finally disappeared from detection, it is possible that this strain still remains in the earth, and any possible reassortment of two or more catastrophic H1N1 viruses may be a great challenge to human survival [9]. Although varieties of influenza A virus display a strong ability for reassortment of their gene segments [5], [11], it is not clear whether the reassortment between H1N1 2009 and H1N1 1918 viruses will occur. Meanwhile, investigation of the biological aspects of these strains is urgently needed for influenza A virus control and prevention. In this study, we established H1N1-2009pp and H1N1-1918pp using the HAs and NAs cloned from the H1N1 viruses of 2009 and 1918. We then characterized the HA and NA matching patterns of these two influenza A virus strains to provide important biological information about these H1N1 viruses.",

To investigate whether the HA of the 2009 H1N1 virus strain matches with NA in addition to its own spousal NA of the 2009 H1N1 virus strain, we generated pps with the combination of HA2009 + NA2009, as well as the combination of HA2009 + NA1918. As described above, the combination of HA2009 + NA2009 may form infectious H1N1-2009pp well; interestingly, the chimeric combination of HA2009 + NA1918 may also form infectious pp with infectivity of 11.2 \u00b1 3.12% (Fig. 3\nA), suggesting that HA of 2009 H1N1 virus strain could match NA of 1918 H1N1 virus strain as well. Similarly, to examine whether the NA of the 2009 H1N1 virus strain matches with HA in addition to its own spousal HA of 2009 H1N1 virus strain, we generated pps with the combination of HA2009 + NA2009, as well as the combination of NA2009 + HA1918; the chimeric combination of NA2009 + HA1918 may also form infectious pp with infectivity of 9.0 \u00b1 2.0% (Fig. 3A), suggesting that NA of the 2009 H1N1 virus strain could match HA of 1918 H1N1 virus strain as well. Moreover, the infectivity of the NA2009 + HA1918 combination was significantly higher than both na\u00efve combinations (p < 0.05), indicating that the NA2009 + HA1918 combination may produce a more infectious new pp (Fig. 3A). Taken together, our data reveal that the HAs and NAs of 1918 and 2009 H1N1 virus strains may form infectious chimeric pps, raising the alarm for the possible reassortment of the two catastrophic H1N1 virus strains.",

Methods based on bioinformatics cannot provide direct solid data to support its analysis, and owing to biosafety limits, it is not suitable to perform reassortments using wild-type viruses. Consequently, our pp system provides a safe and convenient approach to investigating possible reassortments. Our data demonstrated that the combination of HA2009 + NA1918 resulted in infectivity greater than that of the na\u00efve combinations HA2009 + NA2009 and HA1918 + NA1918. This suggests that the H1N1-2009 virus may not only recombine with H1N1-1918, but it may also produce a more infectious new virus, raising an alarm for the possible reassortment of the two catastrophic H1N1 virus strains.",
