Two of the leading types of cancer are the human breast cancer (HBC) and the human colon cancer (HCC). The estimated new cancer cases and deaths in US for 2008 shows that HBC will affect 26% of the women (15% will die) and HCC will involve 10% of the men/women (8% men and 9% women will die) (Jemal et al., 2008). Therefore, simple and fast theoretical method can be very useful in the detection of cancer diseases.",

QPDR is one of the widely used analyse for predicting the protein properties and, in the present study, is using the macromolecular descriptors, named topological indices (TIs), obtained with the graph theory. The branch of mathematical chemistry dedicated to encode the DNA/protein information in graph representations by the use of the TIs has become an intense research area (Ag\u00fcero-Chapin et al., 2006; Bielinska-Waz et al., 2007; Liao and Wang, 2004; Liao and Ding, 2005; Randic, 2000; Randic and Basak, 2001; Randic and Balaban, 2003; Randic et al., 2000). The graphic approaches of the biological systems study can provide useful insights in QSAR studies (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2006, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007c; Prado-Prado et al., 2008), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990), enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Chou, 1989; Chou and Forsen, 1980; Chou and Liu, 1981; Kuzmic et al., 1992), inhibition kinetics of processive nucleic acid polymerases and nucleases (Althaus et al., 1993a, Althaus et al., 1993b; Althaus et al., 1994, Althaus et al., 1996; Chou et al., 1994), DNA sequence analysis (Qi et al., 2007), anti-sense strands base frequencies (Chou et al., 1996), analysis of codon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1994) and in complicated network systems investigations (Diao et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2008, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2007a). Recently, the \u201ccellular automaton image\u201d (Wolfram, 1984, Wolfram, 2002) has also been applied to study hepatitis B viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a), HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b), and visual analysis of SARS\u2013CoV (Gao et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005), as well as representing complicated biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a) and helping to identify protein attributes (Xiao and Chou, 2007; Xiao et al., 2006b). We have chosen the TIs for these QPDR models based on the previous work results with similar QSAR/QPDR models. Even if the TIs cannot be always interpreted, they demonstrate to encode the information that permits to create accurate QSAR/QPDR models.",

This model can predict if a protein is HBC or HCC-related using a single equation. For this reason, in addition to the 30 star graph embedded and non-embedded TIs are introduced other two types of continuous predictors (attributes) encoded specific information about each cancer types as following: 30 products of the HBC/HCC cancer probability with the embedded/non-embedded TIs (pTI=probHBC/HCC*TI) and 30 differences between the same TIs and the average of the TIs for each type of cancer [dTI=TI\u2013average(TI)HBC/HCC]. The cancer probabilities represent the fractions of proteins HBC/HCC-related from the entire Sj\u00f6blom's proteins (cancer proteins) and have values of 0.639 (HBC) and 0.361 (HCC). For each protein there are two cases corresponding to both types of cancer. The dependent variable (CancerOrNot) takes 1 for cancer and 0 for non-cancer and the cross-validation (CV) variable has two values (train and val). The best CV methods to examine a predictor are the following: independent dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test (Chou and Zhang, 1995). Chou and Shen, 2007, Chou and Shen, 2008 have shown that only the jackknife test has the least arbitrariness . Thus, the jackknife test has been increasingly used by investigators to examine the accuracy of various predictors (Chen and Li, 2007a, Chen and Li, 2007b; Diao et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2008; Lin, 2008; Niu et al., 2006; Xiao and Chou, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2007). In the actual work, the independent data test is used by splitting the data at random in a training series (train, 75%) used for model construction and a prediction one (val, 25%) for model validation (the CV column is filled by repeating 6 train and 2 val). All independent variables are standardized prior to model construction.",

This difference can be explained by a superior recover of the cancer-related protein sequence information in the case of the differences between the original TIs and the average of them for each type of cancer (dTIs) compared with the products of the original TIs and the cancer type probability (pTIs). Thus, we can conclude that the average of star graph structure for each type of cancer (dTIs) is described better the actual QPDR model compared with the composition of the data sets for each type of cancer that generates the cancer probabilities. In addition, Table 2 shows that better results are obtained using the original TIs and the derived ones (pTIs and dTIs) compared with the isolated TIs/pTIs/dTIs. This difference can be explained be the fact that each set of indices can contains different parts of the protein information that is cancer-related.

The embedded TIs models contain more frequent the trace of the graph/sequence connectivity matrixes tr 3 and the non-trivial part of the Schultz TI S (W is based on the distance matrix, X5 and S on the degree matrix, and tr 3 on the connectivity matrix). The most important type of index that is present in both embedded and non-embedded TI equations is J, the Balaban distance connectivity index based on the node distance degree information. In order to compare two equations with the same number of TIs, we have chosen the embedded models with pTIe and {TIe, pTIe} that contain six variables and reduced the common terms (based on tr 3, S and J). Thus, we can observe that the addition of the TIe to the pTIe will shift the preference from the low order traces (p\n tr 0e, p\n tr 2e) and Kier\u2013Hall index (p\nX2e) to high order trace (tr 5e), Harary number (He) and Gutman TI (S6e).",

These values were analysed with tw-JCA using 61 mutated proteins and 17 types of single amino acid mutations. In the case of HBC, we obtained 215 data groups, called input blocks. To detect the larger variability regions (mutants) we computed a tw-JCA partition of input blocks (rearrange of blocks) setting the threshold value of variability at StDv/2 (see Fig. 2\n). The value obtained was 0.059. The 215 input blocks are regrouped, for similarity, into 11 output blocks (see Tables S3 and S4 in the supplementary material). We can observe that the proteins with number 24 to number 48 are very susceptible to become HBC-related proteins for all studied mutations. The plot corresponding to the reduced values of the reordered data matrix (Table S4) is presented in Fig. 3\n. On the other hand, we carried out the same study for the HCC mutated proteins and found different susceptible proteins, with visible lower probability to be HCC-related (Fig. 4\n). The 184 input blocks were regrouped, for similarity, into 11 output blocks (StDv/2=0.050) (see Tables S5 and S6 in the supplementary material).

The most persistent mutation (log-odd PAM250=4), valine (V) to isoleucine (M), can be considered as the most dangerous one. The main calcium/strontium binding site within each monomer involves the main chain oxygen atom of Ala-457, and also the side chains from residues Asn-436, Asp-438, Glu-485, and Glu-490. The mutations of Glu (E) in Q and D can affect the capacity of binding metals and the normal biological activity. This coagulation factor XIII is a transglutaminase which stabilizes blood clots by covalently cross-linking fibrin, being essential for normal haemostasis. FXIII deficiency due to the genetic mutations results in a life-long bleeding disorder with added complications in wound healing and tissue repair (Anwar et al., 1998). In addition, the abundant fibrinogen present in the tumor connective tissue might contribute to the structural integrity of breast or colon tumor tissues (Costantini et al., 1991; Takahashi et al., 2000; Yee et al., 1994). We can observe that, in general, the natural mutations with higher PAM250 values are less frequent even for 1QRK B (Y\u2192F with PAM250 of 7 is absent) because we cannot create a direct relation between the PAM250 natural amino acid mutation frequency and the influence of the mutations in these types of cancer.",

For each type of cancer, ten HBC/HCC-related proteins where mutated using the same PAM250 values. The tw-JCA plots are presented in Fig. 6\n(for HBC) and Fig. 7\n(for HCC), and correspond to data in Tables S7 and S8 from the supplementary material. The results did not show important probability to obtain a HBC/HCC-related protein by using single PAM250 natural mutations. Activin beta E (INHBE, C_5) has the highest probability (around 50%) to turn into a HBC-related protein after almost all the mutations (Fig. 6 and Table S7).",

In addition, the prediction of cancer probability for mutated proteins was calculated. The human coagulation factor XIII (1QRK B), that normally do not generate HBC, if suffer several mutations, can become a HBC-related protein.",
