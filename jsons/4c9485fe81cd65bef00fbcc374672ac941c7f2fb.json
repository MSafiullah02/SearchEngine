Such efforts to identify the causes of these infectious outbreaks lead to a wealth of information about the viruses and their host.

For example, data and bioinformatics tools from ViPR and IRD have facilitated research into detection and diagnostics of viral pathogens, prediction of viral hosts and environmental reservoirs, viral evolution, development of vaccines, discovery of genomic determinants of virulence, and anti-viral drug development.

These databases can be further distinguished as sequence archives such as GenBank (see \"Relevant Websites section\"), and UniProt (see \"Relevant Websites section\"), where data is deposited by the primary investigators and curated DBs such as RefSeq (see \"Relevant Websites section\") that integrate additional knowledge (e.g., annotations) with sequence records to provide an enhanced knowledgebase. Biomolecule information other than sequences is also stored in other databases, including the Protein Data Bank (PDB; see \"Relevant Websites section\"), which stores 3D structural data, the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; see \"Relevant Websites section\"), which catalogs experimental data on B cell and T cell epitopes studied in humans and other animals and the Virus Particle Explorer (VIPERdb; see \"Relevant Websites section\"), which stores the structures of viruses with icosahedral virions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 158, "end": 167, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Types of Databases"}, {"text": "Virology databases have also been designed to focus on particular taxa of viral pathogens. For example, recognizing hepatitis B virus as a major public health problem worldwide, the Hepatitis B Virus Database (HBVDb; see \"Relevant Websites section\") has been designed to facilitate research on the genetic variability of HBV and its resistance to treatment. HBVDb allows the analysis of annotated sequences for genotyping and drug resistance profiling. Similarly, a collection of databases for research on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are available (see \"Relevant Websites section\") that contain comprehensive data on genome and protein sequences and immunological epitopes. Because influenza virus poses perhaps the most persistent major global public health threat, several databases are dedicated to research on influenza. For instance, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; see \"Relevant Websites section\") is an access-controlled resource of influenza sequence information and related epidemiological data. FluNet (See Relevant Websites Section) is a global web-based influenza surveillance data collection, maintained at the World Health Organization (WHO) and available for tracking the movement of flu viruses globally. The Influenza Virus Resource (see \"Relevant Websites section\") supports the search and analysis of influenza genomic and protein sequences at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

With the foresight into the importance of such capabilities, several dedicated webtools are available for the users to conduct various types of analyses on viral genomes. For instance, tools such as IDSeq (see \"Relevant Websites section\"), Virome (see \"Relevant Websites section\") and VirusDetect (see \"Relevant Websites section\") allow detection of viruses from deep-sequencing of metagenomics samples. IDSeq is designed with the aim of real-time pathogen detection from metagenomes. Virome focuses on environmental metagenomes, whereas VirusDetect specifically uses small RNA datasets to detect viruses using both de novo and reference-based assemblies. Once a novel virus isolate or variant is detected, tools such as the Viral Genome ORF Reader (VIGOR; see \"Relevant Websites section\") enable genome annotation. VIGOR is a homology-driven viral gene prediction program that yields predicted proteins and mature peptides for newly sequenced isolates and variants of human virus. The software uses a set of highly curated databases enabling VIGOR to annotate a given viral genome. Currently VIGOR supports gene prediction and annotation of about 25 different virus taxonomic groups. Tools are also available to study the viral pathogen in the context of its host environment. For instance, STRING-Viruses (see \"Relevant Websites section\") is a webtool available as part of the STRING database that allows assessment of protein-protein interactions using visualization tools such as Cytoscape. This webtool is particularly important for studying how viral proteins interact with host proteins during various stages of infection. Likewise, NextStrain (see \"Relevant Websites section\") is a webtool that enables rapid, real-time tracking of evolving pathogen populations during infectious outbreaks.

The Genomic Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (GCID) program submit detailed structured metadata, including clinical information such as disease symptoms, severity, and diagnostic test outcomes, that are linked with sequence records of the corresponding virus isolate obtained from GenBank.

Derived data include improved and consistent metadata annotations including strain name, clade and genotype information, virus taxonomy, host and country of isolation, and collection date. For instance, the ViPR annotation process extends information available in the representative RefSeq strain for each species. The process uses multiple sequence alignment to map homologous regions across related viral genomes to map mature peptide cleavage sites on polyproteins. Likewise, a custom annotation pipeline is used in IRD to predict open reading frames and sequences for variants of influenza proteins including PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, M42, NS3 and PB1-40. The predicted variant proteins can be retrieved from the Nucleotide and Protein Sequence Search pages. Various tree-based clade classification tools are also available and have been used to predict clades and genotypes of pathogenic strains of several viruses including Zika, rotaA, and Hepatitis C virus in ViPR and H1N1, H5N1 and swine H1 strains in IRD. Furthermore, Sequence Features (SFs) are derived using information integrated from UniProt, GenBank, IEDB and the scientific literature followed by inspection and validation by domain experts. SFs are protein regions with important structural, functional, immune epitopes, or sequence alteration characteristics. Once the SF protein regions are defined, the extent of sequence variation observed in each region is determined as a series of Variant Types (VTs). Lastly, the Host factor component of IRD/ViPR contains a variety of derived data that gives insights about the systems-level infection dynamics. For instance, host factor biosets are group of genes/proteins/metabolites that are significantly differentially expressed/abundant at different times post infection. Data models derived using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) are available to aid identification of co-expressed genes that may be functionally related, tightly co-regulated or members of similar pathway. The set of co-expressed genes can also be visualized as Cytoscape networks where nodes represent genes and edges represents the strength of co-expression. Table 3 ViPR and IRD offer frequent updates on all data types. Genome sequence data are updated daily (IRD) or weekly (ViPR) while all other data types are updated with each bimonthly release.

The highly curated strain level data are displayed with a Genome Map image and a Protein Information table from which detailed structural and functional information for a given gene/protein can be obtained. ViPR utilizes RefSeq strains to extend the manually-curated annotations to strains belonging to the same taxon. Furthermore, RefSeq sequences are used to construct virus ortholog groups and their associated annotations, which enable identification of proteins with similar function within a given virus taxon. ViPR and IRD also offer curated data on T-cell and B-cell immune epitopes and their predicted positioning on protein structures from the IEDB. Data curation in ViPR and IRD continues to grow and expand beyond sequence and strain level information.
