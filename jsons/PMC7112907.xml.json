These assays require nucleic acid extraction from biological samples. The yield and quality of nucleic acids have a direct impact up assay performance (Liu, 2008, Muldrew, 2009). The traditional DNA/RNA isolation techniques using phenol/chloroform extraction are time consuming and prone to sample cross contamination and PCR inhibition from phenol/chloroform carryover. Manual column purification kits using glass fiber filters were developed to replace phenol/chloroform extraction procedures. These kits involve alkaline lysis of cells followed by capture of nucleic acid on a filter membrane in a spin column in the presence of chaotropic reagents. Although these methods have demonstrated improved performance and are extensively used for general molecular biology purposes, they require large elution volumes and are subject to problems such as filter clogging and inconsistent yield (Yang et al., 2008). In addition, increasing demand in clinical diagnosis necessitates reliable automated methods for efficient recovery of nucleic acid from clinical specimens. A solid phase binding technology using magnetic beads was introduced into robotic systems to provide rapid and high-throughput detection capacity (Akutsu et al., 2004).",

Evaluation of methods that allow simultaneous DNA and RNA extraction is useful for clinical diagnosis because the etiology of acute respiratory diseases includes a wide spectrum of microorganisms that can have RNA or DNA genomes and may be present singly or as mixed infections (Mancini et al., 2008, Paranhos-Baccala et al., 2008). Pathogen coinfections are common and may implicate poor prognosis. For example, a recent investigation of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) cases found that presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in H1N1 patients was associated with higher mortality (Palacios et al., 2009). Concurrent detection of several viruses with Gram positive/negative bacteria has been reported in children with pneumonia (Korppi et al., 1991, Palacios et al., 2009, Wolf et al., 2010). These dual or mixed infections require simultaneous isolation of pathogen DNA and RNA for detection.",

KingFisher Flex was purchased and added to the phase two studies. Extractions were performed by trained users of each platform on three separate days. PCR-grade water (Cat# 9935, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was processed in parallel to monitor cross contamination. DNA/RNA was eluted into 100.0 \u03bcL elution buffer supplied by the manufacturers.

Ten-fold serial dilutions of the spiked samples were prepared in 100 \u03bcL of nasal wash. These samples were coded and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.

To compare the relative dynamic range of the extraction systems, a phase two studies were performed as described in Section 2. KingFisher mL and EasyMag were able to extract nucleic acid from L. pneumophila, adenovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus that were spiked into human nasal wash at concentrations spanning 5- to 6-logs (Fig. 2\n). In contrast, the dynamic range (linearity) was 1\u20132 logs less in DNA extractions from S. pyogenes for all of the methods. It was worth noting that the linearity of EZ1 instrument was 1\u20133 logs less than that of KingFisher mL and EasyMag for DNA extraction from S. pyogenes, RSV, and influenza A virus (Fig. 2).",

Biorobot MDX, easyMag and Allprep use a chemical lysis reagent. All other robots deploy enzymatic digestion that involves incubation at room temperature (MagNA Pure Compact) or at elevated temperature (EZ1, KingFisher mL and KingFisher Flex). In addition to the chemistry, the procedures used on each platform are also different. For example, the KingFisher mL and KingFisher Flex are open systems so they are able to accommodate chemistries from different suppliers. Protocol steps and reagent volumes can be modified with the KingFisher Software. In contrast, easyMag (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France), EZ1 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and MagNA Pure Compact (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) are closed systems with preprogrammed protocols, which should minimize cross contamination and human errors. In addition, maximum input sample volume, length of automated protocol, and capacity for high throughput differ across the platforms (Table 1). These variations may lead to differences in lysis efficiency, loading capacity, or in the capability of removing inhibitors.",

The outer cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria consists of a complex of cross-linked peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, polysaccharides, and other proteins, whereas the Gram-negative cell wall is thinner with a fairly simple cross-linking pattern. Although both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are Gram-positive bacteria, lysis of S. pyogenes appears to be more challenging because S. pyogenes contains more peptidoglycan and its cell wall polysaccharide is estimated at 6\u201310% of the dry weight of the microorganisms (McCarty, 1952, Salton, 1953). The viral genome is wrapped within a protein capsid or lipid bilayer membrane. These structural differences may explain why all of the methods displayed similar efficiency in DNA extraction from the DNA virus (adenovirus) and the Gram-negative bacterium (L. pneumophila) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), but exhibited about a 20-fold difference in efficiency in DNA recovery from Gram-positive S. pyogenes (Fig. 1).",

Nucleic acid recovery, degree of inhibition, carry over contamination, reproducibility, and linearity of the protocols were evaluated. No single protocol was superior for all of the agents tested. Rather, their performance appeared to be pathogen specific. The MagNA Pure Compact was most suitable for DNA extraction from the Gram-positive S. pyogenes, whereas KingFisher mL and EasyMag provided better performance for the RNA viruses. The data suggest that the choice of inappropriate methods for nucleic acid extraction may introduce bias to clinical diagnosis or epidemiological investigation, as only organisms susceptible to the method selected would be detectable at lower levels.",
