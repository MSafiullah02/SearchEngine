In this new context, digital supply chains [1] are fundamental to organizations that seek to achieve efficient processes, create business value, and gain a competitive advantage in a sustainable approach. This environment has given rise to new methods such as digital connectivity, interconnection, and interoperability [3], which have emerged as paradigms to be fully grasped by SCM stakeholders, which have to develop new strategies to implement critical technologies and integrate them with the SCM field [4]. The concepts of interconnection and interoperability clearly define the level of digital connectivity [3] of an organization, and consequently, of the way it manages its supply chains. Interconnection in SCM refers to the connection enabled by different technologies in which supply chain partners can obtain information (mainly in real-time) from customers and SCM members and share such data while maximizing value by taking into account the personalization requirements [5].",

The following aspects are required:Design indicators for intra-organizational and operational performance in logistics by means of digital connectivity strategies: considering the challenging landscape imposed by the digital connectivity, organizations need to develop reliable key performance indicators [39] in all business perspectives, especially within the SCM.Apply indicators to measure SCM operational performance using digital connectivity strategies: after the design of key indicators, the next challenge is to implement them [40]. This implies that traditional measures are not sufficient [41] to face the digital connection age.Manage a set of key indicators about the improved processes across the supply chain networks: to follow the digital connectivity results and improve the decision-making process, a performance measurement system (PMS) [40] is fundamental.\n",

For instance, the connectivity can lead to improved flexibility, optimized interactions with suppliers around the globe, and real-time inventories, among others [1].Optimize the level of services, interconnection and interoperability in the SCM using suitable technologies: cutting-edge connectivity is expected to significantly improve the level of services. For example, product embedding sensors would enable real-time analysis of operations and thus help optimize transaction efficiency and speed in process delivery, among others [1].Improve/generate competitive advantage supported by interconnection and interoperability: if all the dimensions of the SIMPLE framework interact harmoniously, the organization will be able to improve or generate competitive advantage.
