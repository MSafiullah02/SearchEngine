This hazard has been increased by the concept of epidemiological transition that prevails in developed countries despite its clear refutation by the above data.",

Seventy-seven persons became sick and 66 died from infections, the victims scattered over a 4.02 km radius. The source aerosols had an estimated mass ranging from milligrams to some grams.3 The dispersion and stabilization power of the aerosol vehicle over the inoculum and the fundamental vulnerability of research laboratories to these particles as infective vehicles are evident given the frequency and the volume of aerosol generating procedures. These aerosol particles are liquid, solid, or mixed particulate bodies in suspension in a fluid (in this case air), whose size varies from 0.01 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, hence being extremely light and able to remain in suspension for long periods of time.",

The researcher had had no direct contact with the viral suspension and was certified as having had no mosquito bites during the procedure, leaving only aerosol as the source of infection. Following 8 days of incubation the researcher presented with fever, muscular pain, and rash, and only lymphocytosis as a remarkable feature, being this a mild normal presentation of CHIKV infection.9 The last case of alphavirus infection was a laboratory infection with Mayaro virus (MAYV) reported in 1999 in which the mode of infection was aerosol inhalation. This occurred during a sucrose\u2013acetone antigen extraction procedure, followed by obtainment of solid antigen by dehydration with the use of a vacuum pump.10 The infection with aerosol as source was demonstrated, and developed clinically following 6 days of incubation with fever and indistinct and mild clinical course, which is expected for normal MAYV infections.10\n",

It must be pointed out that although the clinical development was of mild viral fever, the incubation period ranged from 30 to 90 days, while the normal incubation period for natural RVFV infection is up to 6 days.25 The analyzed cases of CCHFV infection resulted from a single hospital cluster in which one patient presenting hemorrhagic fever due to infection with this virus was examined by a physician whose skin was exposed to bloody vomit during the procedure. After this mucocutaneous exposure, the physician developed fever, leukopenia, and hemorrhages consistent with hemorrhagic fever caused by this virus, and recovered 1 month later. The four remaining cases were exposed to the virus during a surgical procedure on the above mentioned patient, in which a surgeon and an assistant officer had close contact with the patient and an anesthetist and another member of the surgical team also had contact with the patient's blood. Hence the mode of infection was probably mucocutaneous, although the possibility of infective aerosol exposure from the patient's airways cannot be discounted. All four of these cases presented hemorrhagic fever, with a fatal outcome for the surgeon and the assistant officer.24\n",

Two of the cases were nurses who cared for a patient with Bolivian hemorrhagic fever during the last 3 days of disease and life, in which the mode of infection was probably mucocutaneous, though there was also the possibility of infective aerosol involvement. The clinical presentation in one of these nurses was of classical Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, with 10 days of incubation followed by jaundice, necrotizing bronchopneumonia, hemorrhages, and death on the 12th day of illness. Clinically, the other nurse developed fever and nausea after 9 days of incubation and was hospitalized 6 days after, following which hemorrhagic fever presented; the nurse recovered on the 11th day of hospitalization. The third analyzed case in this cluster was a medical examiner who cut his thumb while performing an autopsy on the first nurse at 3-h post-mortem. He immersed the thumb in formalin, changed his gloves, and resumed the autopsy. After 4 days of incubation, fever (38 \u00b0C) manifested, with subsequent jaundice requiring the hospitalization of this case. Hemorrhagic fever then manifested and he died 5 days after hospitalization, with disseminated parenchymal necrosis and lung consolidation being found on pathological analysis.29\n",

Despite that, the researcher only wore a disposable gown, two pairs of gloves, and a surgical mask (droplet protection only), which constitute BSL2 personal protective equipment. The researcher had no positive pressure high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered respirator, and after performing a centrifugation of 200 ml of viral suspension in a bottle with Vero cell culture (high titer viral suspension with high volume), viral suspension was found in the bottom of the rotor and the outside of the bottle was wet when the lid of the rotor was opened by the virologist. After 8 days of incubation the researcher presented myalgia, neck stiffness, fever, and headache. On hospitalization, fever (37.6 \u00b0C), tachycardia (96 bpm), hematocrit of 42%, leukopenia, platelet count of 138 \u00d7 109/l, and moderate proteinuria were present, and intravenous ribavirin was administered for 9 days.

Another exceptional case was an accidental simultaneous infection with HCV and HIV by percutaneous mode of infection.43 For the HCV the period of incubation was 44 days and was followed by mild acute hepatitis.43 Three other HCV infection cases were remarkable due to the exceptionally short incubation periods following percutaneous infection.

The series of analyzed reports on infections with these viruses begins with two cases of infection with herpes B (Macacine herpesvirus 1; McHV1) in laboratory settings. The first case occurred in 1932 and was caused by an infected monkey bite resulting in ascending myelitis and death. In the second case, a small skin injury came into contact with infected monkey saliva, resulting initially in a local herpetic lesion and then in a clinical outcome similar to the first case, with respiratory arrest and death within a few days.58 One additional infection with herpes B (McHV1) occurred by mucocutaneous mode of infection in a research laboratory setting. This case was exposed to unidentified secretions of an infected macaque in the eye. Ten days after this exposure the affected eye was swollen and red but without dendritic lesions, and 5 days later the worker presented fever (38.5 \u00b0C) and conjunctivitis and was hospitalized. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed the presence of 8 lymphocytes/ml, and acyclovir (15 mg/kg) was administered from 2 h after hospitalization. The worker was discharged after 11 days on intravenous ganciclovir outpatient therapy; 1 day later the worker suffered ascending myelitis and subsequently flaccid paralysis. After the presentation of seizures, the clinical picture of postviral acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was considered and this patient was then treated with foscarnet. Over the course of 9 days the patient developed nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, and died 33 days after the beginning of symptoms from refractory respiratory failure.59\n",

The agent was a recombinant strain containing the cytohesin 1 gene whose product inhibits the biochemical cascade triggered by the binding of lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), therefore inhibiting inflammatory cell migration. Clinically, this case presented a local hemorrhagic necrosis in one exposed finger and a papule on the other exposed finger.62 The third case of VACV infection occurred as a student processed a viral suspension of 1010 PFU/ml (high titer), and the most likely mode of infection identified in this report was mucocutaneous, with viral particles carried by the hands to the eyes; alternatively there was the possibility that the eyes were exposed to infective aerosol. The clinical result of the infection was classical purulent ocular vaccinia.63 The likelihood of inoculum carried by hands to the eyes constitutes a clear breach of adequate laboratory procedures and demonstrates the absence of use of personal protective equipment (goggles) as a factor in the occurrence of the infection.",

In comparison, inhalation of infective droplets was involved in 13 SARS cases, accounting for 5.4% of the cases in hospitals, and a cluster of norovirus infections in a Swiss hospital69 through oral mode of infection accounted for 15% of the analyzed cases in the hospital setting. In this study, only one cluster of accidental infections with aerosol inhalation as the mode of infection in a hospital was obtained from one report; this is probably a result of the difficulty of conducting epidemiological surveys of such infections, likely leading to sub-notification of cases.",

The number of analyzed cases has consistently grown through these periods, the first period did not include any hospital cases, and there were more references and cases in the last period than in the first two put together, due mainly to hospital case reports. These data support the idea of a decreasing sub-notification over time, and there are two reasons for these results: the first two periods correspond to the time of discovery and early characterization of many of the analyzed viruses, whereas the last period is marked by the development of the biosafety concept, resulting in a greater number of notifications. Moreover, the volume of virological research and the number of patients with viral diseases in hospitals have both grown over time. There is a uniformity in the laboratory viral infections profile respective to the mode of infection over time; remarkably only two of the percutaneous infections in laboratories were reported in the first period. There are two complementary conclusions that can be derived from these data: (1) there is no sub-notification bias specific to specific modes of infection over time, which was unexpected, and (2) the measures and protocols of biosafety generated to minimize the number of these accidental infections involving specific modes of infection were less effective than commonly supposed. In addition the majority of percutaneous infections in the hospital setting during the last period occurred with syringes after completion of the necessary procedure in the patient and even during needle recapping, demonstrating clear suboptimal implementation of the universal precautions, contact precautions, body fluid isolation, and standard practices of infection control.",

Also 15 of 21 first infections by arboviruses with aerosol involvement occurred during work with infected animal tissue suspensions. Another evident risk factor is the virus being handled, not only this study demonstrates that Piry, WEEV, TBEV, and alphaviruses in general are peculiar with respect to the risk of productive infection upon inoculation through aerosol inhalation, as the clinical severity of an infection by non-conventional mode of infection is clearly virus-orientated as displayed in WEEV, TBEV, McHV1 infections, with a smaller contribution of host resistance for the clinical presentation and outcome.",

However such results are likely the product of a sub-notification bias, as blood-borne viruses are the most frequently diagnosed hospital infections and these are the leading etiologies for infections by this mode of infection. No consistent correlation analysis could be pursued for the probability of infection or its severity and the deepness of the exposure with regard to the modes of infection analyzed. Even a comparison for the percutaneous and mucocutaneous modes of infection was not feasible due to the lack of data with respect to the deepness of exposure variable in a significant portion of the reports; this limitation hampered such a comparison even for those cases with the percutaneous mode of infection. Similarly comparison between the inocula in different cases for different modes of infection was not feasible due to the limitations in the data with regard to the quantity of infective aerosol and droplets. Even the data on inocula in percutaneous infections are limited. The best approach for the issue is to use the clinical state of the source patient as a parameter for the inocula. Such an approach gave positive associations in the case of simultaneous HIV and HCV accidental infection,43 in the case of Lassa hemorrhagic fever,16, 66 and in a case of dengue fever caused by mucocutaneous exposure for which the source patient presented secondary DENV infection with hepatitis and signs indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever.23 However the case of fulminant hepatitis by HBV42 and the lack of data even in percutaneous case reports supporting this notion decrease support for this idea. The atypical or exceptionally severe infections in hospitals do not correlate with the mode of infection or the viral agent involved, and neither a greater deepness of exposure nor higher inocula were reported for these infections. Therefore, although the potential contribution of these factors cannot be ignored, the relevance of the individual host resistance as a factor for the occurrence of such cases is well supported in the hospital setting, whereas the relevance of this factor in such processes is lower in laboratory settings, as supported by the results and analyses presented herein.",

In order to target percutaneous exposures, complete training in the correct usage of needles and sharps should be provided, the use of two pairs of gloves is recommended, needlestick-prevention devices should be used, and even the number of samples or animals to be processed per batch should be limited in a given procedure.",

Hence an expansion of the current standard precautions is advisable. Strongly recommended are the use of needlestick-prevention devices and the use of two pairs of gloves, with the outer pair being changed whenever the current standard precautions require the gloves to be changed. The use of a mask and goggles is also recommended whenever dealing with a feverish patient or whenever there is any reason to suspect a viral infection, particularly a blood-borne viral infection. N95 masks are highly recommended when treating patients with severe respiratory signs or in cases of hemorrhagic fever, and isolation is recommended in these cases, especially the latter. Definitive laboratory diagnosis and identification of the etiology should be sought when dealing with viral infections, especially the acute and potentially lethal ones. Of the eight analyzed cases whose mode of infection was completely unexpected (five percutaneous, one mucocutaneous by DENV, and one mucocutaneous by YFV) and whose clinical development was exceptionally fast and severe (fulminant hepatitis by HBV with mucocutaneous infection), two of the dengue cases (the mucocutaneous infection and one percutaneous due to deep puncture) would have been avoided by the strict adoption of standard precautions and three cases would have been avoided if not only the standard precaution protocols but also precautionary principle awareness had been in effect. This basic principle of biosafety is here interpreted as follows: total control of all the variables of a complex system is not possible at any given time, therefore the adoption of risk minimization and contingency measures against damages are needed, with reasonable criteria, even when the specific risks under evaluation are considered insignificant a priori.",
