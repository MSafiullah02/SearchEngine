A study of 59 patients with COVID-19 found that 34% of patients developed massive albuminuria on the first day of admission, and 63% developed proteinuria during their stay in hospital.14 Blood urea nitrogen was elevated in 27% overall and in two-thirds of patients who died. Computed tomography scan of the kidneys showed reduced density, suggestive of inflammation and edema. Cheng et al.\n13 recently reported that amongst 710 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 44% had proteinuria and hematuria and 26.7% had hematuria on admission. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen was 15.5% and 14.1%, respectively. AKI was an independent risk factor for patients\u2019 in-hospital mortality.13\n,\n14\n",

At a single HD center in Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, 37 out of 230 patients on HD and 4 of 33 staff members developed COVID-19 infection between January 14 and February 17, 2020.30 A total of 7 patients on HD died, of whom 6 had COVID-19 infection. However, the deaths were deemed to be due to cardiovascular causes and not directly to the COVID-19 infection. Patients on HD with COVID-19 had less lymphopenia, lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, and milder clinical disease than other patients with COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "The Chinese Society of Nephrology31 and the Taiwan Society of Nephrology32 have recently developed guidelines for dialysis units during the COVID-19 outbreak. A summary of these guidelines is provided below.1.A working team consisting of dialysis physicians, nursing staff, and technologists should receive training in updated clinical knowledge of epidemic COVID-19, notification of infection at risk, epidemic prevention tools, and guidelines from the government, academic society, and hospital authority. The list of staff should be recorded and retained by dialysis hospitals.2.Information on travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster (TOCC) history of each medical staff, dialysis patient, their family members, residents of the same institution, and colleagues at work should be collected and updated regularly.3.Latest care recommendations and epidemic information should be updated and delivered to all medical care personnel as needed. Training can be done peer-to-peer or online.4.Group activities, including group rounds, group studies, and case discussions, should be minimized.5.It is recommended that staff members have meals at different times to avoid dining together. Goggles, masks, and hats should be removed before meals, and hands washed with flowing water. Talking during meals should be minimized to reduce the spread of droplets.6.Staff should self-monitor their symptoms and should inform the team leader in case they or their family members develop symptom(s) suggestive of COVID-19 infection.7.Entrance control, identification and shunting of people at risk of infection, body temperature measurement, hand washing, wearing of proper (surgical or N95) masks throughout the process, machine disinfection, environmental cleanliness, good air conditioning, and ventilation conditions should be instituted.8.Patients and accompanying persons should be given motion-activated hand sanitizer while entering the dialysis room. Patients should wear medical masks and avoid meals during dialysis. They can bring convenience food such as candy to prevent hypoglycemia.9.Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be admitted to a negative-pressure isolation ward of specified hospitals. If the capacity of the isolation facility is overloaded, the Fixed Dialysis Care Model detailed below is recommended for dialysis patients under the 14-day period of quarantine for possible contact with COVID-19.a.Place of dialysis treatment: patients should continue HD at the original HD center and not change to another center.b.Dialysis shift and personnel: do not change dialysis shifts and caregiver staff to avoid cross-contamination and infection. Minimize the relevant contacts.c.Patients who need vascular access surgery should be screened for novel coronavirus before the surgery. Operations on patients with confirmed or suspected novel coronavirus infection should be carried out in a designated room with necessary protection for medical staff.d.Transportation: public transport should not be used. Patients should arrange personal transportation and take fixed transportation routes. Transport personnel and escorts should wear surgical-grade or N95 masks throughout.e.All patients who have fever should be screened for novel coronavirus infection and should be given dialysis in the last shift of the day until infection is excluded.f.Pass route for entering hospital and dialysis unit: the pick-up and drop-off points should not be shared with other dialysis patients. Entering and exiting with other patients at the same time should be avoided. The route, mode, and time of transport of dialysis personnel should be fixed.g.Precautions in dialysis unit: patients should not be in close proximity; treatment and waiting areas should have good air conditioning and ventilation to remove droplet particles from the air.h.Designated care personnel: all personnel involved in direct patient care should undertake full protection, including long-sleeved, waterproof isolation clothing; hair caps; goggles; gloves; and medical masks (surgical mask grade or above). Hand hygiene should be strictly implemented.i.Dialysis machine: equipment that may come into contact with patients or potentially contaminated material should be disinfected according to standard protocols.\n10.If a newly confirmed or highly suspected case of novel coronavirus infection in dialysis centers is identified, disinfection should be carried out immediately. Areas in close contact with these patients should not be used for other patients until cleared.11.The medical waste from confirmed or suspected patients with novel coronavirus infection should be considered as infectious medical waste and disposed accordingly.\n",
