Whenever a new infectious disease emerges, knowledge regarding clinical features, diagnostic tools, treatment options, and transmission dynamics is very critical. Patients with this disease, can transmit the virus even in asymptomatic phase. Most of the time, patients developed cardiovascular complications after the diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. Very rarely, patients presented with acute cardiovascular symptoms like our patient. Prior history of cardiovascular disease always poses poor outcomes with Covid-19 infection like any other respiratory infection. Studies have shown that Covid-19 infection can worsen existing cardiovascular problems or can precipitate new cardiovascular problems [3].",

It can cause direct myocardial injury by altering angiotensin converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways as it binds to ACE2 receptors of myocardium and lung after entry into the human body [4,5]. It can also cause systemic inflammation and cytokine storm which can cause multi organ failure including cardiovascular involvement [6,7]. Hypoxia and respiratory failure pose a demand-supply mismatch causing myocardia injury. Prothrombotic state along with systemic infection causing shear stress from increased coronary flow can precipitate acute myocardial syndrome which is possibly the precipitating factor in our patient. Major electrolyte imbalances due to multiorgan failure and some drugs used for treatment of severe covid-19 infections have been shown to precipitate arrhythmias as well [8].",
