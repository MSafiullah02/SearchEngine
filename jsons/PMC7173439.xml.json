            "text": "Mercapturic acids (S-(N-acetyl)-l-cysteine conjugates) were first identified over 130 years ago and were soon recognized to play a role in the detoxication of certain halogenated xenobiotics (Bauman and Preusse 1879). However, it was not until 1959 that the tripeptide glutathione (\u03b3-glutamylcysteinylglycine, GSH) was recognized as the source of the cysteinyl portion of mercapturates (Barnes et al., 1959, Bray et al., 1959). GSH is found in almost all bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells in high concentration, typically 0.5\u201312 m mol l\u22121 (Stevens and Jones, 1989, Taniguchi et al., 1989). The mercapturate pathway begins with the formation of a thioether bond between GSH and a xenobiotic in a reaction catalyzed (or enhanced) by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Subsequently, the resulting glutathione S-conjugate is converted to a cysteinylglycine S-conjugate by \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and thence to a cysteine S-conjugate by either aminopeptidase N (APN) or cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (cysteinylglycinase) or possibly leucyl aminopeptidase. Finally, the cysteine S-conjugate is N-acetylated to the corresponding N-acetyl-l-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturate is generally more water soluble than is the parent compound and is more readily excreted. (For reviews, see Chasseaud, 1976, Silbernagl and Heuner, 1993, Stevens and Jones, 1989.) Reactions involved in and associated with the mercapturate pathway are shown in Figure 1.\n",

            "text": "Reactions involved in drug metabolism were originally assigned to two general categories (Williams 1959). Phase I transformations serve to unmask a functional group and may involve reactions such as oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. Phase II transformations generate highly polar derivatives (conjugates), such as glucuronides and sulfate esters, which are excreted into the urine. Almost all these transformations are catalyzed by transferases (Cole and Deeley 2006). It was originally thought that phase II reactions complete the processes begun by phase I transformations. Others have suggested that elimination of the glutathione S-conjugate from the cell may represent a phase III detoxication event (Ishikawa 1992). It is now apparent that many xenobiotics are metabolized entirely by pathways that do not involve phase I reactions. Thus, many glutathione S-conjugates are formed from drugs and other xenobiotics without prior transformation. Moreover, glutathione S-conjugates are rarely excreted by the kidney because of their large size and amphiphilic character, and the presence of GGT and dipeptidases in the proximal tubules. Glutathione S-conjugates are often excreted into the bile (Dekant et al., 1994, Marchand et al., 1988, Silverman, 1992) and/or further metabolized, especially to the mercapturate. As a result of ambiguities in classification, some authors have suggested that it may be time to discontinue the designations \u2018phase I\u2019 and \u2018phase II\u2019 metabolism (Josephy et al. 2005).",

Moreover, in special cases the pathway may serve also to metabolize endogenously generated substances such as leukotrienes (Sections 4.17.2.2.8, 4.17.4.1). However, in some cases a diversion of the pathway leads to the bioactivation of xenobiotics rather than to a detoxication. Thus, cysteine S-conjugates formed from some halogenated alkenes are converted to pyruvate, ammonium, and a reactive, toxic fragment by the action of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (Section 4.17.6.1). Leukotriene transformations and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are considered in more detail below.",

These reactions often proceed at a measurable rate in the absence of a catalyst (Koob and Dekant 1991), but in general the reaction is accelerated by the action of GSTs. These enzymes are widespread in nature and are present in most mammalian tissues. In the mammalian liver, GSTs account for >3\u201310% of the soluble protein (Ketterer and Christodoulides 1994). The cytosolic forms are dimers with subunit M\nr of \u223c25 \u00d7 103. Many GST isoforms have been identified in the rat (Ketterer and Christodoulides 1994). Cytosolic GSTs are now usually classified into several classes (A (alpha), M (mu), P (pi), T (theta), Z (zeta), O (omega), and S (sigma)) according to their isoelectric point, substrate and inhibitor properties, antibody recognition, and N-terminal amino acid sequences. GSTs may also be broadly classified on the basis of their cellular location, namely microsomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic (Hayes et al. 2005). The enzymes contain a binding site for GSH (nucleophile) and a separate binding site for hydrophobic compounds with electrophilic centers. GSTs are highly specific for GSH as nucleophile, but, depending on the isozyme, exhibit wide and overlapping substrate specificities with regard to the electrophilic substrate. Binding of GSH to the active site facilitates ionization to the nucleophilic thiolate anion (GS\u2212) (Ketterer and Christodoulides 1994).",

GSTs also catalyze reactions with epoxide moieties (e.g., in the conversion of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) to leukotriene C4 (LTC4)).

            "text": "In 1959, it was postulated that a glutathionase (an enzyme that degrades GSH) played a role in the formation of mercapturic acids (Bray et al. 1959). Previously, Binkley and Nakamura had demonstrated that the first step in the breakdown of GSH is cleavage of the \u03b3-glutamyl bond followed by cleavage of the cysteinylglycine peptide bond (Binkley and Nakamura 1948). The enzyme that cleaves the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of GSH and glutathione S-conjugates was subsequently isolated and named \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT; also known as \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase) (Orlowski and Meister, 1965, Szewczuk and Baranowski, 1963). A second enzyme that cleaves \u03b3-glutamyl bonds (converting the glutathione S-conjugate LTC4 to the corresponding cysteinyl-glycine conjugate LTD4) was identified independently by two groups in the 1990s and named GGT-rel and \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase (Carter et al., 1997, Heisterkamp et al., 1991). In humans, the genes that encode GGT and \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase are located in close proximity on the long arm of chromosome 22, in an area of the genome that has undergone multiple duplications (Bailey et al., 2002, Bulle et al., 1987, Heisterkamp et al., 1991). With the cloning of the human genome, GGT pseudogenes and genes encoding truncated portions of GGT have been identified, in addition to several genes that theoretically could encode a full-length protein (Heisterkamp et al. 2008). To date only GGT and \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase have been shown to be expressed as functional proteins. Heisterkamp and colleagues recently collaborated with the HUGO (Human Genome Organization) Gene Nomenclature Committee to standardize the nomenclature for the GGT gene family (Heisterkamp et al. 2008). The new nomenclature designates \u03b3-glutamyltransferase as GGT1 and \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase as GGT5. For clarity throughout this chapter, we will continue to use the descriptive names \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase. Homologues of GGT are expressed throughout the plant and animal kingdoms (Martin et al., 2007, Morrow et al., 2007, Ubiyvovk et al., 2006).",

Human GGT consists of 569 amino acids (Goodspeed et al., 1989, Rajpert-De Meyts et al., 1988, Sakamuro et al., 1988). Only the first four amino acids of the N-terminus extend into the cytosol (see Figure 2). All of the enzymatic activity takes place in the extracellular portion of the enzyme (Horiuchi et al., 1978, Tsao and Curthoys, 1980). The enzyme is translated as a single polypeptide chain (Nash and Tate 1982). In the endoplasmic reticulum, the protein is cleaved into two subunits that remain noncovalently bound (Kinlough et al., 2005, Nash and Tate, 1982). Both subunits are required for activity (Gardell and Tate 1981). The enzyme contains seven potential N-glycan sites. N-Linked glycans have been isolated from GGT and characterized (Yamashita et al., 1983, Yamashita et al., 1986). GGT in rat has been shown to contain two O-linked glycans, but no O-linked glycans have been reported for human GGT (Blochberger et al. 1989). Cleavage of the large subunit by papain or bromelain releases a hydrophilic form of the enzyme that is catalytically indistinguishable from the intact membrane-bound enzyme (Ikeda et al. 1995b). The crystal structures of GGT homologues from Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori have been reported, but mammalian GGT has not yet been crystallized (Morrow et al., 2007, Okada et al., 2006).\n",

GGT is also expressed on the apical surface of pancreatic acinar cells, and activity can be detected in pancreatic juice and bile (Kristiansen et al. 2004).

The \u03b3-glutamyl group of the substrate is transiently bound to the enzyme and the reaction proceeds through a modified ping-pong mechanism (Keillor et al. 2005). In the human enzyme, arginine 107 and aspartate 423 are implicated in binding the \u03b1-carboxylate and \u03b1-amino group, respectively, of the \u03b3-glutamyl moiety (Ikeda et al. 1995a). Cleavage of the \u03b3-glutamyl bond releases the glutamyl donor as the first reaction product. The \u03b3-glutamyl group is released from the enzyme when the enzyme:\u03b3-glutamyl complex reacts with either a water molecule, yielding glutamate, or with the \u03b1-amine of an amino acid (transferase or transpeptidase reaction), yielding a \u03b3-glutamyl amino acid (Taniguchi and Ikeda 1998). The \u03b1-amine of a free amino acid or a dipeptide can serve as an acceptor for the \u03b3-glutamyl group (Thompson and Meister 1977). The enzyme is routinely assayed by the development of a yellow color upon the release of p-nitroanaline from \u03b3-glutamyl-p-nitroanalide. The addition of an acceptor such as glycylglycine in a large excess (10- to 40-fold excess relative to the substrate concentration) accelerates the rate of the reaction. The standard biochemical assay is conducted at pH 8.5, the pH optimum of the transferase reaction.",

The essential nature of this reaction was established with the development of GGT knockout strains of mouse (Lieberman et al. 1996). GGT-null mice were born at expected ratios with no apparent phenotypic abnormalities. However, they excreted high levels of GSH in their urine, failed to grow at the same rate as their wild-type littermates, and died by 10 weeks of age from a cysteine deficiency. GGT-null mice can be rescued by supplementing them with N-acetyl cysteine. Earlier work with cultured cell lines had shown that expression of GGT enabled cells to initiate the release of cysteine from extracellular GSH (Hanigan and Ricketts 1993). GSH cannot be taken up intact by most cells. In the knockout mice, GSH present in the glomerular filtrate passes intact through the proximal tubules and is excreted into the urine (Lieberman et al. 1996). In wild-type mice, GGT localized to the apical surface of the proximal tubules cleaves the \u03b3-glutamyl bond releasing glutamate and cysteinylglycine. The cysteinylglycine dipeptide can be cleaved into cysteine and glycine by any of several dipeptidases present on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells (Section 4.17.2.3). Cysteine can be synthesized from methionine or through a salvage pathway, but the knockout mice are not able to maintain an adequate supply of cysteine for growth and development while continuously excreting large amounts of GSH in the urine. The GGT knockout mouse becomes deficient only in cysteine, indicating that uptake of amino acids does not depend on GGT, as had been proposed by some investigators (Orlowski and Meister 1970). A physiological role for the transferase reaction has not been demonstrated.",

The new gene named GGT-rel cleaved the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of LTC4 (a glutathione S-conjugate) but did not cleave the \u03b3-glutamyl substrates routinely used to assay GGT activity. The nucleotide sequence revealed 39.5% identity between the amino acid sequences of GGT and GGT-rel. The similarity included a hydrophobic domain (amino acids 12\u201328) similar in location to the transmembrane domain of GGT, indicating that GGT-rel is also a type II membrane protein with the active site on the cell surface. The ability of the GGT-null mouse to cleave the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of LTC4 and release LTD4 led Carter and coworkers to initiate a search for another enzyme that could cleave \u03b3-glutamyl bonds. They identified an enzyme in the mouse they called \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase, which has since been shown to be the mouse homologue of GGT-rel (Carter et al. 1997). There is also a GGT-rel homologue in the rat (Potdar et al. 1997). Heisterkamp and colleagues presented data that \u2018suggested\u2019 GGT-rel could cleave the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of GSH. However, tissues from the GGT-null mouse, which expresses GGT-rel, did not catalyze any detectable cleavage of GSH or glutathione disulfide (GSSG) indicating that GGT-rel has very weak, if any affinity for GSH as a substrate (Carter et al., 1997, Heisterkamp et al., 1991). Acivicin inhibits both GGT-rel and GGT, but glycylglycine does not accelerate the velocity of GGT-rel as is observed for GGT (Carter et al., 1994, Carter et al., 1997).",

However, studies with GGT-null and GGT-rel null mice indicate that in vivo GGT does not metabolize LTC4 to LTD4, which may be due to the localization of GGT in ducts and glands, sites distinct from those that synthesize LTD4 (Carter et al., 1994, Han et al., 2002).",

APN is a type II metalloproteinase that belongs to the M1 family (Luan and Xu 2007). The M1 family consists of at least nine members, five of which are integral membrane proteins (Albiston et al. 2004). APN is important in modulating the activity of several peptide hormones (Albiston et al., 2004, Luan and Xu, 2007). The enzyme also serves as a receptor for coronaviruses and other human viruses, and influences immune function, cell proliferation, secretion, and angiogenesis (Luan and Xu 2007).",

APN is a homodimer (M\nr of the subunit, 130 \u00d7 103) that contains two zinc ions per enzyme dimer. The enzyme has a broad specificity toward dipeptides and oligopeptides, amides, and arylamides. Usually the N-terminal amino acid is cleaved. The best substrates generally contain an alanine residue at the N-terminus but almost any amino acid can substitute, including proline. When the N-terminus is a proline followed by a hydrophobic residue a dipeptide may be cleaved from the N-terminus (Tate, 1985, Tate, 1989). As a result the enzyme can degrade a large number of peptides down to single peptides (or occasionally dipeptides). The enzyme hydrolyzes a number of endogenous peptides, including the thrombin receptor activation peptide (Coller et al. 1993). The human enzyme is identical to myeloid marker protein CD 13 (Look et al. 1989).",

The human enzyme has been shown to possess an additional sorting signal that allows the enzyme to be segregated in the trans-Golgi network and then to the apical membrane (Wessels et al. 1990). APN, like GGT, is glycosylated (Tate 1989). An intimate relationship exists between high mannose glycosylation and polypeptide folding during the synthesis of the mature enzyme, the timing of which is essential for correct polypeptide folding (Danielsen 1992).",

The enzyme is a dimer (M\nr of the monomer \u223c50 \u00d7 103) and contains four zinc ions per enzyme dimer (Kozak and Tate, 1982, Tate, 1985, Tate, 1989). The rat enzyme is glycosylated, but the human kidney enzyme apparently is not (Campbell et al. 1984). The enzyme is selectively inhibited by cilastatin, whereas APN is selectively inhibited by bestatin. This selectivity has allowed Tate and coworkers to estimate that about 65, 60, and 95% of S-methyl-cysteinylglycine hydrolyzing activities of the rat renal, jejunal, and epididymal membranes are due to cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (reviewed in Tate 1989). Furthermore, cysteinylglycine dipeptidase is the major activity responsible for the hydrolysis of cystinyl-bis(glycine) and LTD4 in these membranes (Kozak and Tate, 1982, Tate, 1989). The enzyme is also thought to be responsible for the hydrolysis of some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as perem and carbaperem (Campbell et al. 1984). The primary structure of the human cysteinylglycine dipeptidase has been deduced from the cDNA by Adachi et al. (1990b). The enzyme is located on the surface of the brush-border membranes (Tate 1989). The cDNA codes for 411 amino acid residues beginning with a signal peptide of 16 residues (Adachi et al. 1990a). A highly hydrophobic region of 16 amino acids was deduced to reside at the C-terminus, but the sequence was later shown to be absent from the mature protein expressed in COS cells (Adachi et al. 1990a). The enzyme, unlike APN, is refractory to release from membranes with papain (Tate 1989). It is released, however, by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Tate 1989). The enzyme is converted from an amphipathic to a hydrophilic form by this treatment. Adachi et al. (1990a) showed that the enzyme is anchored to the membranes at a serine residue via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol.",

However, J\u00f6sch et al. (1998) have reported that a cytosolic liver cysteinylglycinase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cysteinylglycine and model cysteinylglycine S-conjugates. Mammalian cells contain plasma membrane transporters for dipeptides and tripeptides (e.g., Rubio-Aliaga and Daniel 2002). Thus, formation of the cysteine S-conjugate may occur intracellularly as well as extracellularly. The cytosolic activity may be especially important in species such as guinea pig and human that exhibit high hepatic GGT activity (J\u00f6sch et al. 1998). The same group later identified the enzyme as manganese-dependent leucyl aminopeptidase (synonyms: cytosolic aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase 3, proline aminopeptidase, peptidase S; LAP3, LAPEP, PEPS) (J\u00f6sch et al. 2003). This enzyme also appears to be important in GSH turnover in bovine lens (Cappiello et al. 2004).",

Acetyltransferase activity toward alkyl cysteine S-conjugates was detected in rat liver slices by Barnsley et al. (1969). Subsequently, an acetyltransferase that N-acetylates cysteine S-conjugates (eqn [4]) was shown to be present in liver and kidney microsomes (Green and Elce 1975). Evidence has been presented that the activity in microsomes is due to a single enzyme (Birner et al. 1997). The enzyme exhibits some activity toward cysteine and methionine, but is much more active with S-benzyl-l-cysteine and other cysteine S-conjugates.

The importance of the biliary excretion system is underscored by experiments in which 1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) is administered to experimental animals. ANIT is a hepatotoxicant that induces portal edema, parenchymal necrosis, and inflammation of the bile duct epithelium. ANIT reacts reversibly with GSH. The conjugate is released to the bile where the reverse reaction results in bile duct damage and increased GSH concentration (Jean et al. 1995). A number of compounds, including isothiocyanates and isocyanates (e.g., methylisocyanate, the compound responsible for the Bhopal tragedy), can react reversibly with GSH and thereby be disposed throughout the body (Baillie and Kassahun 1994). Biliary cannulation protects rats from the nephrotoxic effects of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and p-aminophenol (Gartland et al., 1990, Nash et al., 1984). This finding also emphasizes the importance of the biliary excretion as a first step in complex multiorgan pathways involved in glutathione S- and cysteine S-conjugate metabolism (Dekant et al. 1994).",

In this context, it is notable that although the specific activity of GGT in the whole adult rat liver is low, the specific activity locally in the luminal membranes of the bile duct epithelium and bile canalicular membranes of hepatocytes is much higher (Tate and Meister 1985). The mixture of S-conjugates in the gut may have at least four fates: (1) excretion with the feces; (2) absorption from the gut to the general circulation and eventual processing in the kidney; (3) recirculation through the enterohepatic system; and (4) metabolism within the gut lumen (Dekant et al., 1988, Dekant et al., 1994). Catabolic reactions within the gut lumen may include conversion of cysteine S-conjugates to pyruvate, ammonium, and a thiol-containing fragment by bacterial cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases. The thiol metabolite may be converted to the thiomethyl derivative by thiol S-methyl transferase. The thiomethyl compound may be excreted or enter the circulation where it may be further oxidized to a sulfoxide and to a sulfone (Larsen and Bakke 1979). These reactions are considered in more detail in Sections 4.17.5.6, 4.17.5.7. Some cysteine S-conjugates formed in the bile may reenter liver cells to be converted therein to the corresponding mercapturate.",

The presence of GGT and dipeptidase in the microvilli of the brush border of the enterocytes (Tate and Meister 1985) ensures that at least some of the glutathione S-conjugate is metabolized within the enterocyte, resulting in release of the cysteine S-conjugate to the circulation. In some cases, the mercapturate may be formed in the small intestinal cells and released to the circulation (Grafstr\u00f6m et al. 1979). However, in other cases, some glutathione S-conjugate may enter the circulation from the brush-border membranes of the gut cells via a mechanism that does not require GGT. This transporter may be identical with the GSH transporter (Dekant et al. 1994).",

            "text": "GSTs are widespread among different tissues (Chapter 4.16). Therefore, it is possible that although glutathione S-conjugates are usually made preferentially in the liver, some may be made elsewhere in the body. Indeed, for several xenobiotics a major site for cysteine S-conjugate formation appears to be the kidney (Hassal et al., 1984, Kanhai et al., 1989, Koob and Dekant, 1990). The glutathione S-conjugates released to the circulation from the liver, gut, and other organs or generated directly in the kidney may be further processed in the kidney. The kidneys efficiently remove GSH and glutathione S-conjugates from the circulation by filtration (\u223c25%) and by basolateral uptake (\u223c75%) (Schrenk et al. 1988). Glutathione S-conjugates transported in the blood are generally too small to be retained by the glomerulus and enter the proximal tubules as part of the glomerular filtrate. Glutathione S-conjugates produced by the renal tubule cells can also be excreted into the lumen of the tubule (Kramer et al. 1987). The glutathione S-conjugate is metabolized at the brush-border membranes by GGT and APN/dipeptidase (Hughey et al., 1978, Jones et al., 1979). In this process the glutamate is released to generate a cysteine S-conjugate and glycine (Curthoys and Hughey 1979). The cysteine S-conjugates produced in the tubules (and S-conjugates arising from tissues other than kidney reaching the tubular lumen via glomerular filtration) may be transported into the renal epithelial cells from the glomerular filtrate by active and passive uptake mechanisms (Anders 2004). Both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transporters have been implicated in the renal uptake of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) (e.g., Anders, 2004, Lash and Anders, 1989, Schaeffer and Stevens, 1987a, Schaeffer and Stevens, 1987b). Most of these studies have focused on uptake of DCVC across the basolateral (peritubular) membrane of the renal proximal cells (Wright et al., 1998, Wright et al., 1998 showed that DCVC is taken up by a Na+-dependent transport system in isolated renal brush-border membrane vesicles (Wright et al. 1998). Several neutral amino acids, but especially phenylalanine, cysteine, and leucine, compete with uptake of DCVC across the luminal membrane in this system (Wright et al. 1998).",

The transporter has high affinity for haloalkene-derived mercapturates, but is also active with glutathione S- and cysteine S-conjugates with lipophilic attachments to the sulfur (Lash and Anders, 1989, Ullrich et al., 1989). Probenecid protects against the nephrotoxicity of certain haloalkene-derived S-conjugates in vivo, probably by blocking the uptake of the mercapturate (Zhang and Stevens 1989).

They may be secreted unchanged for further metabolism, principally within the liver. Uehara et al. (1983) have described the presence of two energy-dependent uptake systems for leukotriene E4 in rat hepatocytes which are not inhibited by GSH or GSSG. Cysteine S-conjugates taken up within the liver are thought to be converted to the corresponding mercapturates and secreted to the plasma to be eventually excreted in the urine (Inoue et al., 1981, Inoue et al., 1982, Inoue et al., 1987). The cysteine S-conjugates within the kidney may also be N-acetylated to the corresponding mercapturate and excreted in the urine (Heuner et al. 1991) or be converted by cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases to pyruvate, ammonia, and a fragment consisting of the original electrophile modified to contain an \u2013SH group (Section 4.17.6.3). As indicated in the foregoing discussion, once formed in the kidney or transported to the kidney, mercapturates are excreted in the urine. However, they are also capable of being cleaved to cysteine S-conjugates by aminoacylases within the kidney (see Section 4.17.5.8). The major interorgan pathways involved in the disposition of mercapturate and mercapturate intermediates are shown in Figure 3.\n",

As reviewed by Cole and Deeley (2006), the ABC family in humans contains 49 members organized into seven subfamilies (A\u2013G). Probably, the most important glutathione S-conjugate transporters are MRP1 (multidrug resistance protein 1; ABCC1) and MRP2 (ABCC2) (Cole and Deeley, 2006, Nies and Keppler, 2007, Sibhatu et al., 2008, Slot et al., 2008). The ABCC2 transporter is important for the transport of LTC4 (Jedlitschky and Keppler, 2002, Nies and Keppler, 2007). Additional ABCC members, including long MRP6, short MRP4, MRP5, MRP8, may also be involved in GSH and glutathione S-conjugate efflux (Cole and Deeley 2006). Interestingly, there are several mechanisms by which GSH may be involved in the ABCC1-catalyzed ATP-dependent transport of various compounds directly out of the cell: (1) transport of the glutathione S-conjugate, including LTC4, (2) GSH-stimulated egress (e.g., vincristine), and (3) GSH-stimulated efflux of the glutathione S-conjugate (e.g., the glutathione S-conjugate of nitroquinoline 1-oxide) (reviewed by Cole and Deeley 2006).

The transcellular transport of solutes is dependent on the hydration state of the liver. Thus, bile formation is an important factor in liver osmoregulation. Solutes excreted into the bile by appropriate canalicular transporters include bile acids, glucuronides, and glutathione S-conjugates (Kubitz and H\u00e4ussinger 2007). Thus, glutathione S-conjugate secretion plays a useful role in liver osmoregulation. However, as noted in several places throughout this chapter, some glutathione S-conjugates (e.g., those derived from halogenated alkenes) are toxic to the kidneys, liver, and other organs. We suggest that the hepatotoxicity may result in part from damage to the biliary system resulting from conversion of the glutathione S-conjugate to the cysteine S-conjugate followed by release of a toxic fragment by the action of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (see Section 4.17.6 for a discussion of the cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases and their role in bioactivation).",

The authors suggest that the transporter plays an important role as a resistance mechanism for preventing apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutic agents and a variety of external/internal stressors, including oxidative stress, heat shock, and radiation (Awasthi et al. 2003).

Most effects of the leukotrienes are exerted via interactions with specific receptors on the cell surface (Ishikawa 1993). Two cell-membrane receptors have been well characterized, namely CysLT1 (synonyms: cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, cysteinyl leukotriene D4 receptor, LTD4 receptor) and CysLT2 (Kanaoka and Boyce 2004). CysLTR1 belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family. CysLT1 is the receptor that participates in cysteinyl leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction of individuals with and without asthma. Stimulation by LTD4 results in the contraction and proliferation of smooth muscle, edema, eosinophil migration, and damage to the mucus layer in the lung. This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. The rank order of affinities for the leukotrienes is LTD4 (K\nd\n \u223c1 nM) > LTE4 = LTC4 (K\nd\n \u223c10 nM) > LTB4. The CysLT1 receptor is widely expressed, with highest levels in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes. Lower expression occurs in several tissues, such as lung (mostly in smooth muscle bundles and alveolar macrophages), placenta, small intestine, pancreas, colon, and heart. Selective antagonists, such as montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and pranlukast (Onon), are used in the treatment of asthma, asthma-related diseases, and a few nonasthma related diseases (Riccioni et al. 2007).",

These o-quinones react readily with GSH and cysteine to form catecholamine glutathione S- and cysteine S-conjugates, respectively, which may account for the low levels of GSH in the substantia nigra of Parkinson disease (PD) patients. The cysteine S-conjugates of DOPA, dopamine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid are present in human brain (Spencer et al. 1998). Interestingly, the concentrations of these compounds are generally lower in many regions of human postmortem PD brain compared to control brain. However, the concentrations of these conjugates are significantly higher in the substantia nigra of the PD patients, suggesting that these compounds may contribute to the damage in this region of the brain in PD patients (Spencer et al. 1998).",

The neurotoxicity of 5-S-cysteinyl catecholamines may be due to their further oxidation to benzothiazine species, such as DHBT-1 (dihydrobenzothiazine-1-(2-aminoethyl)-3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid) (Shen et al., 1996, Shen et al., 1997).

Complex I components/activity are markedly decreased in PD brain, whereas complexes II\u2013V activities are relatively spared (Mann et al., 1992, Mizuno et al., 1989, Schapira et al., 1990). A common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is a decline in cerebral energy metabolism. In PD brain, this decline is due in part to decreased complex I activity. However, other mitochondrial enzymes/complexes of cerebral energy metabolism (e.g., \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC)) may also contribute to decreased energy production in neurodegenerative disease (reviewed by Gibson et al. (2005)). For example, KGDHC activity is decreased in PD brain (Mizuno et al. 1994). Interestingly, DHBT-1 and its electrophilic metabolites are potent inhibitors of KGDHC (Shen et al. 2000) and PDHC (Li and Dryhurst 2001) in disrupted rat brain mitochondria, apparently via covalent modification of crucial cysteine residues.",

Catechols are major metabolic products of estrogens. They are readily oxidized to the corresponding o-quinones, which in turn are converted to GSH adducts. Monks and Lau (1994) suggested that these glutathione S-conjugates may be released from the liver ultimately to be accumulated in the kidney as the cysteinyl conjugates. The cysteine S-conjugates may (1) react directly with DNA, (2) generate reactive oxygen species, or (3) be further transformed to insoluble polymers (possibly involving cyclization reactions) that cause local irritation and cell proliferation (Monks and Lau 1994). More recent data from Monks and coworkers suggest that quinones derived from estradiol and specific glutathione S-conjugates of estradiol are potent inhibitors of human GSTM1-1 and GSTA1-1 (Abel et al. 2004).",

Many of these compounds are cytotoxic and mutagenic (reviewed by Anders, 2004, Anders, 2008). In the presence of GSH and a liver GST preparation these compounds are converted to glutathione S-conjugates and eventually to alkenes. Depending on the structure of the dihaloalkane, the mechanism may involve E2 elimination, substitution followed by elimination, or both (Livesey et al. 1982). In the case of 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane, reaction of the dihaloalkane with GSH yields S-(2-haloethyl)glutathione and halide ion. There is evidence for the formation of an episulfonium intermediate (1-(glutathione-S-yl)thiiranium) from S-(2-haloethyl)glutathione as an intermediate in the formation of haloalkene (Livesey et al. 1982). S-(2-Haloethyl)glutathione may be converted to the thioether cysteine S-conjugate (S-(2-haloethyl)-l- cysteine) by the action of GGT and dipeptidases. Loss of halide ion yields an episulfonium cysteine S-conjugate (1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)thiiranium). 1-(Glutathione-S-yl)thiiranium is thought to be the species responsible for the mutagenicity of vicinal dihaloalkanes by forming an adduct (S-(2-(N\n7-guanyl)-glutathione)) with DNA. 1-(2-Amino-2-carboxyethyl)thiiranium is thought to be the cytotoxic species (reviewed by Anders 2008).",

In the first step, GSH forms an adduct with methylglyoxal (a toxic byproduct of glycolysis) yielding the glutathione S-conjugate \u2013 S-d-lactoylglutathione \u2013 in a reaction catalyzed by glyoxalase I. This enzyme is a metalloglutathione S-transferase that catalyzes a 1,2 hydrogen transfer (Creighton and Hamilton 2001). In the second step, glyoxalase II catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of S-d-lactoylglutathione to free GSH and d-lactate (glyoxalase II reaction) (Cordell et al. 2004). Interestingly, trypanosomes have a two-enzyme system identical to the mammalian glyoxalase system, except that trypanothione (two glutathione moieties covalently bridged by spermidine) is used in place of GSH. Thus the glyoxalase system in trypanosomes is a potential drug target (Silva et al. 2008).",

The bis(conjugate) arises from an attack of a second GSH on an electrophilic center on the monoglutathionyl conjugate. The reaction may be nonenzymatic but in most cases the nature of the reaction is unknown. The mechanism of bis(glutathionyl) adduct formation with bromobenzene is complex. Bromobenzene can be converted to several products in vivo, but in one pathway in rats it is sequentially oxidized to o-bromophenol, 2-bromohydroquinone and 2-bromoquinone. 2-Bromoquinone is subject to attack by GSH at any one of three places on the ring, yielding three possible positional isomers. These isomers can then react further with another molecule of GSH to yield 2-bromo-3,5-(diglutathion-S-yl)- hydroquinone or 2-bromo-3,6-(diglutathion-S-yl)- hydroquinone (Monks et al. 1985). In the case of hexachlorobutadiene, microsomal GST catalyzes GSH adduct formation with elimination of HCl.

These sulfoxides are nephrotoxic, but the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated (reviewed by Anders 2008). Part of the nephrotoxicity of DCVC, however, may be due to sulfoxide formation in vivo and subsequent Michael addition at the terminal carbon of the vinyl group by a suitable nucleophile. Michael addition is much more favored in the case of the DCVC sulfoxide than with DCVC itself. The nucleophile may be GSH. Indeed, S-(1-chloro-2-(S-glutathionyl)vinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide, formed by Michael addition of GSH and elimination of HCl, was detected in the bile of rats treated with DCVC sulfoxide. There was a marked decrease of hepatic GSH which may have been depleted during the formation of the sulfoxide (Sausen and Elfarra 1991).",

Aminoacylase I can catalyze the deacetylation of several N-acetylated amino acids, of which N-acetyl-l-methionine is the best substrate. The enzyme also catalyzes the deacetylation of mercapturates derived from halogenated alkenes (Anders and Dekant, 1994, Giardina et al., 1997, Giardina et al., 2000, Heese et al., 1988, K\u00f6rdel and Schneider, 1976, K\u00f6rdel and Schneider, 1977, Uttamsingh and Anders, 1999, Uttamsingh et al., 1998a, Uttamsingh et al., 1998b). Aminoacylase I activity toward haloalkene-derived mercapturates is widespread in mammalian tissues (Uttamsingh et al. 2000). The enzyme has been cloned from porcine, bovine, and rat tissues (Jakob et al. 1992; Mitta et al., 1992, Perrier et al., 2004, Raphel et al., 1999. The amino acid sequence of human aminoacylase I has been deduced from the cDNA (Mitta et al. 1993). Rat kidney, but not pig kidney, appears to contain two isoforms (Perrier et al. 2004). Pig kidney aminoacylase I shows strong sequence homology to renal dipeptidase and is now assigned to the M20 peptidase family (Liu et al. 2006). Pig kidney aminoacylase I, like the dipeptidase, is attached to membranes (Heese et al. 1988).",

The major physiological function is unclear, although it has been suggested to act on the terminal N-acetyl amino acids released by hydrolysis of peptides containing an N-terminal acetyl amino acid catalyzed by acylamino acid-releasing enzyme (AARE). It has not yet been possible to crystallize the enzyme. Nevertheless, Liu et al. (2006) were able to construct a useful homology model based on the known 3D structures of several members of the M20 peptide family, site directed mutagenesis and docking with N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Previous workers suggested that the zinc ion was needed to hold the enzyme in the correct configuration, but was not involved in catalysis. However, Lui et al. (2006) have presented a new model for the catalytic reaction in which Glu146 functions as a general base, accepting a proton from zinc-bound water and shuttling the proton to the leaving group facilitating breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate.

Part of the US population is exposed to haloalkenes from such sites and in the workplace (Wu and Schaum 2000), and possibly through \u2018recreational\u2019 abuse (Marjot and McLeod 1989). In experimental animals haloalkenes, some halogenated alkanes, and dichloroacetylene are toxic, especially to the kidneys (e.g., Dekant et al., 1994, Elfarra, 1993, Koob and Dekant, 1991. In humans, heavy exposure to trichloroethylene is associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer (Brauch et al. 2004), PD (Gash et al. 2008), and damage to the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve and sensory nucleus of the brainstem (Buxton and Haywood 1967). Cranial nerve damage seems to be associated with formation of dichloroacetylene from trichloroethylene exposed to an alkaline milieu. Dichloroacetylene is an exceptionally good substrate of microsomal GSTs (eqn [2]) and hence is a good precursor of the toxic cysteine S-conjugate DCVC (Reichert et al. 1976). Damage to the trigeminal nerve may be due to the toxic effects of DCVC or to activation of latent herpes virus by the toxic insult (Cavanagh and Buxton 1989).",

Depending on the structure, halogenated alkenes may be metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (especially CYP2E1) and/or by GSTs. The ratio of the two activities varies considerably among the various halogenated alkenes. For example, hexachloro-1:3-butadiene (Wallin et al. 1988) and tetrafluoroethylene (Odum and Green 1984) are metabolized predominantly in rats via glutathione S-conjugation. However, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450s, and only a small portion is metabolized by GSTs (e.g., Koob and Dekant 1991), principally GSTA1-1 (Cummings et al. 2000). Nevertheless, although the cytochrome P450 pathway generates toxic species from trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene (Bull et al. 2002), a major contributor to the overall toxicity of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene is the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate despite the fact that the glutathione S-conjugation pathway is quantitatively minor (Dekant 2003).",

Some of these conjugates are also mutagenic in bacterial tester strains (Commandeur et al., 1991, Dreessen et al., 2003, Finkelstein et al., 1994, Kranendonk et al., 1997, Vamvakas et al., 1988a, Vamvakas et al., 1988b). The cysteine S-conjugate formed from trichloroethylene/dichloroacetylene (i.e., DCVC) induces expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc in LLC-PK1 cells (Vamvakas and K\u00f6ster, 1993, Vamvakas et al., 1993). The mutagenicity depends on the ability of the conjugates to generate chemically reactive thiols \u2013 GGT and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are key enzymes in this process. As noted above, the mercapturates derived from the halogenated alkenes are toxic because they can be hydrolyzed back to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate by aminoacylases (e.g., Uttamsingh et al. 2000). Thus, the mercapturate pathway enzymes together with aminoacylases and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases contribute to the bioactivation of halogenated alkenes. (For reviews, see Anders 2004, 2008; Cooper, 1998, Cooper and Pinto, 2008, Dekant, 2003, Dekant et al., 1994.) The reactive fragments generated from haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates by the action of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are especially cytotoxic in experimental animals to the proximal renal tubules, in particular to the S3 (pars recta) region and, to a lesser extent, the S1, S2 (pars convoluta) region (e.g., Jones et al. 1988) and to isolated human proximal tubules (Chen et al. 1990).",

However, nephrotoxic doses resulted in reduction of the total lyase activity (MacFarlane et al. 1993).

A reduction in the lyase activity could be a protective mechanism as long as the normal metabolic function of the lyase is not compromised too severely.",

However, sub-lethal (priming) doses are autoprotective by stimulating cell division and renal repair (Korrapati et al. 2006). Acute renal failure in humans is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. However, it is potentially reversible if the patients are free of life-threatening complications. Korrapati et al. (2007) have pointed out that the pathophysiology of DCVC-induced acute tubular necrosis followed by acute renal failure in mice and clinical acute renal failure in patients is similar. These authors have begun a proteomic study of this clinically relevant mouse model of priming with low doses of DCVC to afford later autoprotection to the kidney. Whole kidney homogenates from treated and untreated mice were analyzed on 2D gels and spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Eighteen common proteins were shown to be greatly altered in the treated mice, including some enzymes associated with energy metabolism and stress response proteins. Although the proteomic approach to understanding renal disease is in its infancy, this model suggests that biomarker development will be useful in a variety of toxicological paradigms (Korrapati et al. 2007).",

Later, Schultze and coworkers suggested that the toxicity of DCVC is associated with a \u2018C-S\u2019 lyase reaction and formation of a reactive sulfur-containing species that adds to macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids (e.g., Anderson and Schultze, 1965, Bhattacharya and Schultze, 1967, Bhattacharya and Schultze, 1972). It was known for many years that several electrophilic xenobiotics (e.g., phenacetin, acetaminophen, N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene) are thiomethylated in vivo. Thiomethylation was assumed to involve a sulfonium compound derived from methionine. However, Chatfield and Hunter (1973) showed that conversion of 2-acetamido-4-chloromethylthiazole to 2-acetamido-4-methylthiomethylthiazole in rats involves the mercapturate pathway.",

Escherichia coli tryptophanase (a \u2018true\u2019 \u03b2-lyase) and a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase in an extract of Eubacterium limosum were shown to catalyze \u03b2-elimination reactions with the cysteine S-conjugates of E-2-hexenal and 2-hexenol (Wakabayashi et al. 2004). The cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases purified from Fusobacterium necrophorum (Larsen et al. 1983) and F. varium (Tomisawa et al. 1984) have been partially purified and characterized. The enzymes have M\nr values of 228 \u00d7 103 and 70 \u00d7 103, respectively, and require pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. The enzyme from F. necrophorum catalyzes the C-S cleavage of the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor, BTC, and 1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-cysteinylnaphthalene. The propachlor conjugate was shown to be converted to N-isopropylacetanilide, pyruvate, and ammonium. The enzyme from F. varium is most active with aromatic cysteine S-conjugates, but some activity is noted with simple alkyl conjugates. A highly purified cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase was obtained from E. limosum (Larsen and Bakke 1983). The enzyme has an M\nr of about 75 \u00d7 103 and is composed of two identical subunits. The enzyme is active with the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor, trans-9-hydroxy- 10-(S-(l-cysteinyl))-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, BTC, and DCVC. It is also moderately active with the simple alkyl cysteine conjugate S-ethyl-l-cysteine. The enzyme does not require added PLP, but is inhibited by carbonyl reagents suggesting the presence of a carbonyl-containing cofactor. Of interest is the finding that the enzyme is active with cystathionine, djenkolic acid, lanthionine, and cystine, suggesting that the enzyme is similar to cystathionine \u03b2- and \u03b3-lyases. In contrast, the F. necrophorum and F. varium lyases do not exhibit activity with cystathionine. Bernstr\u00f6m et al. (1989) showed that rat fecal contents and the purified E. limosum enzyme catalyze the conversion of the cysteine S-conjugate LTE4 to 5-hydroxy- 6-mercapto-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid. Interestingly, the enzyme can catalyze the conversion of \u03b2-chloroalanine to pyruvate and ammonia, but it is not inactivated in the process. Many PLP-containing enzymes that catalyze this elimination reaction are slowly inactivated by aminoacrylate intermediate(s) formed during the elimination reaction (Section 4.17.6.8). Finally, the E. limosum enzyme exhibits high activity with the S-oxide of propachlor (Larsen and Stevens 1986). The eliminated fragment is presumably a sulfenic acid \u2013RS(O)H.",

The fact that cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase activity is widespread in enteric bacteria and that a major portion of cysteine S-conjugates are excreted into the bile suggests that the gut flora may be important for the incorporation of sulfur into some xenobiotics (Larsen and Stevens 1986). Moreover, it seems that the cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases of the enteric bacteria have different substrate specificities than do the mammalian enzymes. For example, the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor is a substrate for the enteric enzymes, but germ-free rats do not metabolize this compound (Bakke et al. 1981). As noted above, certain sulfhydryl-containing fragments, such as that eliminated from DCVC, are exceptionally reactive and are likely to act locally. Whether cysteine S-conjugates, whose elimination products are very reactive, damage the gut remains to be determined. Additionally, whether more stable thiol products generated from cysteine S-conjugates can be transported from the gut to other regions to exert toxic effects also remains to be evaluated (Larsen and Stevens 1986).",

The human liver enzyme is active with S-arylcysteines but not with S-alkylcysteines.

Interestingly, the enzyme is nine times more active with S-phenylcysteine sulfoxide than with S-phenylcysteine. The identity of this enzyme was also not established. Moreover, the specific activity of the purified enzyme is relatively low (12.3 nmol min\u22121 mg\u22121 with S-(p-bromophenyl)-l-cysteine) and cysteine S-conjugates of halogenated alkenes were not tested as substrates.",

An alternative route may occur, namely reduction of the cysteine S-conjugate of E-2-hexenal to the cysteine S-conjugate of 2-hexenol, followed by a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase-catalyzed elimination to yield directly 3-mercaptohexenol. Both pathways are feasible. A series of alkanoates of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylbutan-1-ol ((CH3)2C(SH)CH2CH2OC(O)R) and a series of alkanoates of 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2CH(SH)CH2CH2OC(O)R), have recently been detected in the fruit peel of Poncilius trifiliata (a close relative of citrus) (Starkenman et al. 2007). The authors suggested that the origin of these volatile sulfur-containing compounds is via \u03b2-lyase reactions on cysteine S-conjugates.",

In the rat, Compound A can form two glutathione S-conjugates, which are eventually converted to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates. These cysteine S-conjugates are substrates of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases giving rise to 2-(fluoromethoxy)-1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropanethiol and 2-(fluoromethoxy)-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propenethiolate, both of which are converted to 2-(fluoromethoxy)-3,3,3-trifluorothionopropanoyl fluoride. Hydrolysis and loss of HF and H2S yields 2-(fluoromethoxy)-3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid. Finally, loss of HF and HCHO yields trifluoroacetic acid. Evidence suggests that a similar pathway for the metabolism of Compound A exists in humans. The pathway suggests that cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are involved in the bioactivation of Compound A in humans, but this hypothesis has been criticized.

However, when DCVC binds to the active site a \u03b2-elimination is catalyzed as a result of the strongly electron-withdrawing moiety attached at the sulfur. This results in the formation of an enamine with resonance stabilized partial carbocation character (eqn [30]) (where R+ is the protonated pyridine form of the intermediate and R is a quinonoid intermediate). In the former case alanine [CH3CHCO2\u2212NH3+] is released from the active site.

For example, pig heart cytAspAT catalyzes \u03b2-elimination reactions with \u03b2-chloroalanine, serine O-sulfate and serine O-phosphate (John and Fasella, 1969, Morino et al., 1974, Ueno et al., 1982). The ratio of transamination to \u03b2-elimination depends in part on the electron-withdrawing properties (nucleofugacity) of the group attached at the \u03b2-position of the amino acid substrate. With \u03b2-chloroalanine and serine O-sulfate only \u03b2-elimination can be detected in the presence of cytAspAT (Morino et al., 1974, Ueno et al., 1982). Several aminotransferases have been shown to catalyze a \u03b2-elimination reaction with TFEC (Table 1). In most cases, transamination was shown to compete with \u03b2-elimination. Presumably \u2013SCF2CF2H is a less effective nucleofuge than is \u2013Cl. However, the \u03b2-elimination to transamination ratio also depends on the enzyme. For example, for mitAspAT with TFEC as substrate the ratio is >100 (Cooper et al. 2002b), but approximately 2:1 for rat kidney GTK (Commandeur et al. 2000). Human BCATm can catalyze a \u03b2-lyase reaction with TFEC, but transamination cannot be detected (Cooper et al. 2003).",

            "text": "It was originally suggested that inactivation of cytAspAT by \u03b2-chloro-l-alanine is due to modification of a lysine residue by aminoacrylate (Morino et al. 1974). However, Ueno et al. (1982) presented evidence that the inactivation in the presence of serine O-sulfate is due to formation of the pyruvate\u2013PLP aldol product. More recently, we showed that rat liver mitAspAT is syntactically inactivated by \u03b2-chloroalanine and TFEC on average after \u223c3850 and \u223c2700 turnovers per enzyme monomer, respectively (Cooper et al. 2002b). We ascribed this difference to the production of one reactive species (aminoacrylate or aminoacrylate bound as Schiff base) in the case of \u03b2-chloroalanine, but two reactive species in the case of TFEC (aminoacrylate and \u2212SCF2CF2H). The eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is chemically very reactive (previous section). Previous work has shown that the \u03f5 amino groups of lysine residues are susceptible to thioacylation (formation of RNHC(=S)CF2H, where R = lysine residue; Fisher et al., 1993, Harris et al., 1992, Hayden and Stevens, 1990, Hayden et al., 1991. We have begun to investigate the mechanism of inactivation of mitAspAT by TFEC. We have noted lysine thioacylation as expected, but have also detected \u2013CF2CF2H linkage to a lysine residue and aminoacrylate addition to a cysteine residue (Cooper and Pinto 2008). Curiously, both human BCATm and BCATc can catalyze \u03b2-elimination with TFEC, but both enzymes are rapidly inactivated. Inactivation occurs on average \u223c170\u2013280 and 40\u201350 turnovers per subunit for BCATm and BCATc, respectively (Cooper et al. 2003). On the other hand, both rat kidney GTK and human GTK are resistant to inactivation by \u03b2-lyase substrates. Human GTK has an unusual \u2018crown\u2019 of aromatic amino acid residues in the substrate binding pocket, which may account for the interaction with neutral amino acids, including cysteine S-conjugates (Rossi et al. 2004). This arrangement may prevent access of reactive fragments to susceptible groups within the vicinity of the active site. Evidently, the relative ease of syncatalytic inactivation by \u03b2-lyase substrates varies greatly among the aminotransferases, and probably depends on ease of access of reactive fragments to susceptible residues in the active site.",

            "text": "As summarized by Cooper (2004), GTK in vitro exhibits a broad specificity toward l-amino acids and \u03b1-keto acids. In general, the enzyme has a preference for l-glutamine, l-methionine (and many other sulfur-containing amino acids), l-phenylalanine (and some other aromatic amino acids), and the corresponding \u03b1-keto acids. As noted above, cysteine S-conjugates are also substrates of rat kidney GTK. Interestingly, l-selenocysteine Se-conjugates are more active aminotransferase and \u03b2-lyase substrates of rat kidney GTK than are the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates, in most cases by an order of magnitude or more (Commandeur et al. 2000). As a consequence, GTK has been suggested to be a possible target for selenium-containing chemopreventive drugs (Commandeur et al. 2000). l-Glutamine is the major amino acid substrate in vivo. The product of glutamine transamination (i.e., \u03b1-ketoglutaramate; \u03b1KGM) is rapidly removed by cyclization to a lactam and/or conversion to \u03b1-ketoglutarate in a reaction catalyzed by \u03c9-amidase. Transamination is therefore \u2018pulled\u2019 in the direction of glutamine utilization. Major roles of GTK are to close the methionine salvage pathway by transamination of \u03b1-keto-\u03b3-methiolbutyrate (KMB), salvage the \u03b1-keto acid analogues of essential amino acids, and possibly to generate cyclic sulfur-containing imines (reviewed by Cooper 2004).",

This ubiquity attests to the importance of these enzymes in amino acid metabolism. The two enzymes are crucial components of the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle for the transport of reducing equivalents (in lieu of NADH) between cytosol and mitochondrion (Fitzpatrick et al. 1983). Oxaloacetate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate link amino acid metabolism to the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle. Coupling of an \u03b1-ketoglutarate/glutamate-linked aminotransferase to AspAT and the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction permits the flow of nitrogen from amino acid to glutamate and thence to ammonium. When this occurs in the periportal cells of the liver this flow directs excess amino acid nitrogen toward ammonium for urea synthesis.

Several AspAT enzymes have been crystallized including chicken mitochondrial and cytosolic forms, the pig cytosolic form, and several bacterial forms (Mehta and Christen, 2000, Schneider et al., 2000). They belong to the Fold Type I family, subclass I. It has long been known that the two isozymes of AspAT can utilize amino acids other than glutamate and aspartate as amino acid substrates. For example, they exhibit some activity with the aromatic amino acids (Miller and Litwack, 1971, Shrawder and Martinez-Carrion, 1972). Rat liver mitAspAT was also shown to readily catalyze transamination of cysteine (Shrawder and Martinez-Carrion 1972). Thus, it occurred to us that this enzyme might be able to utilize cysteine S-conjugates as substrates and this turned out to be the case with rat liver mitAspAT (Cooper et al. 2002b; Table 1). To the best of our knowledge the ability of human mitAspAT to catalyze a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase reaction has not been investigated. However, given the similarity of members of the AspAT family it seems a reasonable assumption that human mitAspAT will catalyze such a reaction.",

On the other hand, it has been reported that acivicin does not protect rats against the nephrotoxicity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (Davis 1988). However, others have shown that S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-l-cysteine (PCBC; the cysteine S-conjugate of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene) is cytotoxic to LLC-PK1 cells (Blackmore et al. 2002). Aminooxyacetate (AOA), a general inhibitor of PLP enzymes protects against DCVC-induced toxicity (e.g., Beuter et al., 1989, Blackmore et al., 2002, Chen et al., 1990, Chen et al., 1994, Lash et al., 1986b) and PCBC-induced toxicity (Blackmore et al. 2002) in LLC-PK1 cells. AOA partially protects against DCVC-induced toxicity in isolated rat kidney proximal tubules (Lash and Anders 1986), but apparently not in isolated human renal proximal tubule cells (Cummings and Lash 2000). \u03b1-Keto acids stimulate the toxicity of DCVC toward rat renal cells (Elfarra et al. 1987), suggesting involvement of aminotransferases in the bioactivation process. AOA protects isolated rat proximal tubule cells against TFEC and the cysteine S-conjugates of chlorotrifluoroethylene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene, and 1,1-dibromo-2,2-difluoroethylene (Boogaard et al. 1989). \u03b1-Methyl DCVC, which cannot be metabolized by a \u03b2-lyase reaction, is not toxic (Anders et al. 1988). Taken together, despite an occasional study to the contrary, the literature strongly supports important roles for GGT and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases in promoting the nephrotoxicity of halogenated alkenes. However, it appears that human renal tissue is less susceptible than that of rat to damage from haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates, presumably as a result of lower specific activities of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases in human renal tissue (Iyer and Anders, 1996, Lash et al., 1990b) and allometric scaling (Anders 2004).",

            "text": "Toxicity of DCVC to kidney cells has been associated with (1) covalent modification of macromolecules, (2) depletion of nonprotein thiols (presumably mostly GSH), and (3) lipid peroxidation (Beuter et al., 1989, Chen et al., 1990, Groves et al., 1991). These effects may be attributable to formation of metabolites derived from a \u03b2-lyase reaction since, as mentioned above, AOA can partially protect against DCVC toxicity in renal tissues and in renal cells in culture. Mechanisms by which metabolites of DCVC and other nephrotoxic haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates alter thiol status may involve direct inhibition of glutathione reductase (Lock and Schnellmann 1990) and generation of oxidative stress that leads indirectly to oxidation of thiol compounds (Chen et al. 1990). Oxidation of DCVC to DCVC sulfoxide followed by formation of a glutathione S-conjugate resulting from the reaction of DCVC sulfoxide with GSH may also lead to oxidative stress (Lash et al., 1994, Sausen and Elfarra, 1991). Other studies lead us to suggest an additional possibility, namely that oxidative stress may result in part from Michael addition of thiols to aminoacrylate generated in the \u03b2-lyase reaction. In experiments in which LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to DCVC, loss of nonprotein thiols was about 40\u201360% (Chen et al. 1990). Interestingly, the authors suggested that depletion of nonprotein thiols to this extent was insufficient to kill the cells. As cited earlier, BTC is relatively nontoxic, despite the fact that it is metabolized in vivo via cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (Elfarra and Hwang 1990). We are unaware of any studies on GSH status in renal cells/tissue resulting from exposure to BTC. Evidently, even if GSH is depleted in renal cells exposed to BTC, this insult may not be sufficient to induce overt toxicity. The implication of the work by Chen et al. (1990) is that in order for a cysteine S-conjugate to exhibit toxicity, it must generate reactive sulfur-containing fragments that covalently add to macromolecules. The toxicity may be enhanced, perhaps synergistically, by oxidative stress and by Michael adduction between aminoacrylate and susceptible nucleophiles such as GS\u2212 and protein sulfhydryls and/or by modification of coenzyme in susceptible PLP-enzymes.",

How then can one explain the unusual susceptibility of kidney to halogenated cysteine S-conjugates? Many factors are presumably involved (Boogaard et al. 1989), including relative distribution of N-acetyltransferase and aminoacylases, cellular and mitochondrial uptake mechanisms, susceptibility to inactivation of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases and nearby enzymes, relative K\nm values, competition from natural amino acid substrates, absolute level of the enzyme, presence of the enzyme in mitochondria, and presence of \u03b1-keto substrate to keep the enzyme turning over (if the lyase in question is an aminotransferase). A major contributing factor is likely to be the very large surface area of the renal proximal tubules coupled to the extraordinary high renal vascular perfusion. In humans, the kidneys represent 0.4% of the body weight, but receive 25% of the cardiac output (Pfaller and Gstraunthaler 1998); the cortex receives 95% of the renal blood flow. Despite these factors, haloalkene cysteine S-conjugate-induced toxicity is not necessarily confined to renal tubules. As we have noted above, toxicity may also occur in the liver and occasionally in neural tissue, presumably as a consequence of the widespread occurrence of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases.",

            "text": "Although the in vitro specific activity of mitAspAT as a \u03b2-lyase toward DCVC and TFEC is somewhat lower than that of GTK (Table 1) the very high level of this enzyme in mitochondria (Parli et al. 1987) suggests that it might play a prominent role in bioactivation of nephrotoxic halogenated cysteine S-conjugates (Cooper et al. 2002b). The importance of mitAspAT as a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase in the bioactivation of TFEC is underscored by the work of Bruschi and coworkers. Bruschi et al. (1993) showed that six kidney mitochondrial proteins are thioacylated after rats are acutely administered a high dose of TFEC. No thioacylation of cytosolic proteins was detected. The six proteins were identified as HSP60, mitHSP70, mitAspAT, aconitase, the E2k (dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase) enzyme component of the KGDHC, the E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) enzyme component of KGDHC, and the E3 enzyme component of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKADHC) (Bruschi et al., 1993, Bruschi et al., 1994, Bruschi et al., 1998, James et al., 2002, Lock and Schnellmann, 1990 had previously reported that metabolites of haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates (DCVC, TFEC, PCBC) inhibited dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). Our findings that mitAspAT catalyzes a \u03b2-lyase reaction with TFEC in vitro and is syncatalytically inactivated in the process (Cooper et al. 2002b) is consistent with the in vivo finding that this enzyme in kidney is thioacylated after administration of TFEC to rats. We also showed that a high-M\nr \u03b2-lyase present in kidney copurifies with HSP70 (Cooper et al. 2001). As cited earlier, the high-M\nr \u03b2-lyase in rat kidney mitochondria contains mitAspAT. This finding provides a mechanism for the thioacylation of kidney mitHSP70 in rats administered TFEC. Conceivably, mitochondrial HSP60 may also associate with a PLP-containing enzyme that catalyzes a \u03b2-lyase reaction with TFEC.",

Moreover, the specific activity of KGDHC, but not that of PDHC, is diminished in the kidneys of TFEC-treated rats (Bruschi et al. 1998). We have found that KGDHC, but not PDHC, is directly inhibited in PC12 cells exposed to 1 m mol l\u22121 TFEC (Park et al. 1999). These findings are remarkable because E3 is a common component of KGDHC, PDHC, and BCKADHC (and the glycine cleavage system). In the presence of TFEC and purified GTK (a source of thioacylating moieties), purified PDHC is more resistant to in vitro inactivation than is purified KGDHC (Park et al. 1999). Moreover, there is some evidence that E3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E2 enzyme components in PDHC, whereas E3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E1 enzyme components in KGDHC (McCartney et al. 1998). Thus, part of the resistance of PDHC to thioacylation/inactivation in kidney mitochondria of TFEC-treated rats may be due to differences in the arrangement of its constituent enzymes. In addition, PDHC is not associated with any aminotransferases/\u03b2-lyases, whereas KGDHC is closely associated with mitAspAT. Thus, the susceptibility of KGDHC to thioacylation by a fragment derived from TFEC may be due to the proximity of mitAspAT or actual colocalization with subunit enzymes (James et al., 2002, Park et al., 1999).",

For example, mitAspAT is part of a metabolon affiliated or localized with KGDHC (see references cited in Cooper et al. 2002a). Based on our findings (Cooper et al., 2002b, Cooper et al., 2003) and those of Bruschi and coworkers (Bruschi et al., 1998, James et al., 2002), we have proposed that not only are metabolites channeled through supramolecular complexes in the TCA cycle, but toxicants are also channeled (Cooper et al. 2002a) (Figure 6). This concept explains not only the susceptibility of KGDHC to TFEC-induced inactivation in rat kidney and cells in culture, but also the susceptibility of aconitase and BCKADHC to thioacylation/inactivation. Aconitase is part of a metabolon that includes KGDHC and mitAspAT (James et al., 2002, Ov\u00e1di and Srere, 2000). Recent evidence also suggests that substrate channeling occurs between a metabolic unit (termed branched-chain amino acid metabolon) consisting of human BCATm and BCKADHC and that the channeling is influenced by the redox state in mitochondria (Islam et al. 2007).\n",

While these compounds are unlikely to be formed from electrophilic xenobiotics in vivo to any large extent they are instructive model compounds. S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-l-homocysteine (DCVHC) is even more toxic than DCVC and the toxicity is potentiated by \u03b1-keto acids. Several amino acids that contain a good leaving group in the \u03b3 position undergo a nonenzymatic \u03b2,\u03b3-elimination reaction when converted to the corresponding amino acid by an aminotransferase (Hollander et al. 1989 and references quoted therein). Activation of the beta C\u2013H bond in the \u03b1-keto acid facilitates a \u03b2,\u03b3-elimination reaction with the production of vinylglyoxylate (2-oxo-3-butenoic acid) (eqn [31]).

DNA damage is the primary mechanism by which cisplatin kills tumor and other dividing cells. However, the renal proximal tubule cells are well-differentiated, nondividing cells that are not killed by other DNA-damaging agents (Hanigan and Devarajan 2003). Evidence has been presented that damage to kidney cells is due to conversion of cisplatin to its glutathione S-conjugate and subsequently to its cysteine S-conjugate.

Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent used for the treatment of hematological and other malignancies prior to stem cell transplantation (e.g., Iwamoto et al. 2004). The mercapturate pathway of busulfan metabolism was shown to occur in rats by the detection of the sulfonium mercapturate, N-acetyl-\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanine in the urine (Hassan and Ehrsson 1987). Busulfan is converted to a glutathione S-conjugate (l-\u03b3-glutamyl-\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanylglycine) by direct interaction with GSH (Ritter et al. 1999) and enzymatic catalysis by GSTs, especially GSTA1-1 (Czerwinski et al., 1996, Gibbs et al., 1996, Ritter et al., 1999, Ritter et al., 2002).

Presumably, therefore, THT can arise nonenzymatically from the glutathione S-conjugate in vivo. However, THT is also likely to arise via an enzymatic route (Cooper et al. 2008b). The detection of mercapturate in rat shows that the cysteine S-conjugate must have been generated in vivo either by direct reaction of busulfan with cysteine and/or via the glutathione S-conjugate. The cysteine S-conjugate of busulfan (\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanine; THT-A) is unusual in that the sulfur is in the oxidation state of a sulfonium rather than a thioether. Since sulfonium compounds are high-energy compounds a \u03b2-elimination reaction yielding THT and aminoacrylate should be energetically favorable. Indeed we have found that (1) homogenates of rat liver, kidney, and brain, (2) \u03bc mol l\u22121 PLP, and (3) highly purified cystathionine \u03b3-lyase can catalyze a \u03b2-elimination reaction with THT-A (Cooper et al. 2008b).

The formation of a GSH analogue in which the cysteine of GSH is replaced by a dehydroalanine residue (\u03b3-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine; Figure 8, structure X) may also be a bioactivation event. It is expected that Michael addition of sulfides across the double will occur. Addition of cysteine or GSH will give rise to peptides bridged by lanthionine residues.

In addition, some natural metabolites (e.g., leukotrienes, prostaglandin (PG)A2, 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-PGJ2, hydroxynonenal) may be eliminated as their mercapturates. However, formation of a glutathione S-conjugate may sometimes lead to bioactivation. For example, glutathione S-conjugates of some hydroquinones and dihaloethanes may be directly toxic. In other cases, the cysteine S-conjugate derived from the glutathione S-conjugate may be toxic. For example, the cysteine S-conjugate of dopamine can form potentially highly toxic benzothiazines. In other cases, the sulfur of the thioether linkages of the S-conjugates of the mercapturate pathway may be oxidized to sulfoxides that are more toxic than the corresponding thioethers. For example, DCVC sulfoxide is more toxic than DCVC. The potential exists for the cysteine S-conjugate sulfoxide to undergo an elimination reaction to generate a reactive sulfenic acid. However, there is no evidence that this occurs in the case of DCVC sulfoxide. In this case, toxicity may be associated with depletion of GSH.",

If the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is not especially reactive the parent cysteine S-conjugate may not be particularly toxic. The sulfur-containing fragment may be thiomethylated or S-glucuronidated and excreted. Alternatively, the fragment may be further oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone before excretion. On the other hand, if the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is chemically reactive (e.g., by covalently reacting with macromolecules) the parent cysteine S-conjugate may be toxic, especially to the kidneys. Electrophiles that are bioactivated by this mechanism include halogenated alkenes and drugs such as methazolamide and cisplatin. Some PCBS and aminophenols may also be metabolized in part by pathways involving cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases. However, the contribution of the \u03b2-lyase reaction to the toxicity of these compounds is not clear. Mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism (KGDHC, aconitase) are especially vulnerable to reactive fragments generated from toxic halogenated, cysteine S-conjugates, by a process that has been termed toxicant channeling.

AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; A, amino acid, dipeptide, or GSH acceptor for the GGT reaction; \u03b3-GLU-A, \u03b3-glutamyl amino acid (or \u03b3-glutamyldipeptide; \u03b3-glutamylglutathione). Many potentially toxic xenobiotics and a few endogenous compounds are metabolized through the mercapturate pathway. Silbernagl, S.; Heuner, A.

The larger subunit traverses the cellular membrane such that most of the protein is exposed to the extracellular milieu. The smaller subunit is entirely within the extracellular milieu. As a result of its location, GGT is often referred to as an ectoenzyme. GGT may catalyze the hydrolysis of the \u03b3-glutamyl compound to free glutamate and R or catalyze reactions with an acceptor (transpeptidation) to generate \u03b3-glutamyl-acceptor and R. The acceptor may be an amino acid, dipeptide, or GSH. Under physiological conditions hydrolysis predominates over transferase reactions.",

AMAC is nonenzymatically converted to pyruvate and ammonium, but also may react with PLP cofactor or susceptible protein residues. The three mitochondrial \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (BCKADHC, KGDHC, PDHC) are represented as multimeric units. Mitochondrial cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases include the homodimeric BCATm and the homodimeric mitAspAT. The close juxtapositioning of BCATm and mitAspAT to enzymes of energy metabolism results in channeling of toxicants to BCKADHC and KGDHC/aconitase (Aco 2), respectively, resulting in their inactivation. PDHC is not known to be associated with any aminotransferase/cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase and is not directly inactivated.

The strong electron-withdrawing properties of the \u2013OS(O2)CH3 group on busulfan (I) results in electron deficiency at each carbon adjacent to the two methanesulfonyl groups. This deficiency facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl of GSH at one of these carbons, resulting in elimination of methanesulfonate (II) and subsequent generation of adduct III. This step occurs nonenzymatically but is accelerated by GSTs. The electron deficiency in the remaining carbon adjacent to the \u2013OS(O2)CH3 group in adduct III facilitates nonenzymatic intramolecular nucleophilic attack at this carbon by a pair of electrons on the sulfur of the thioether, generating the glutathione S-conjugate (V) and eliminating a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. The conjugate (V) possesses a cyclic sulfonium group. GGT (a) and dipeptidases (b) possess broad specificities. Thus, V is expected to be readily converted to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate THT-A (VI). VI may also be formed by nonenzymatic nucleophilic attack of a cysteine sulfur on busulfan (I), which generates adduct IV and methanesulfonate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and elimination of a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. VI contains a strong electron-withdrawing group and is therefore expected to undergo a facile \u03b2-elimination reaction to yield THT (VII), ammonium (VIII), and pyruvate (IX). This reaction occurs nonenzymatically at pH 7.4, but is accelerated by PLP and by rat liver cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (and by other as yet unrecognized enzymes in rat tissues). THT (VII) may also be generated directly and nonenzymatically from \u03b3-E-THT-AG (V) by an elimination reaction that results in the formation of \u03b3-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (X). The conversion of busulfan (I) to the conjugate (V) is shown as occurring in two consecutive steps, but may occur by a concerted mechanism. Note that the sulfur in THT is not derived from busulfan, but rather from the sulfur of GSH.",
