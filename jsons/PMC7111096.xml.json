All spiked samples gave a PCR product of the expected size (data not shown). Positive control material, amplified under identical conditions, consistently produced a band of the expected size on 2% agarose gels following electrophoresis (data not shown). Likewise, TaqMan real-time PCR protocols produced similar variable results when the same samples were analyzed (Table 2).

The clear differentiation between SARS-CoV positive and SARS-CoV negative samples is obvious (Fig. 1A, indicated by arrows). The discrimination between positive and negative signals is more ambiguous when the same samples are analyzed by standard real-time PCR, where the SARS-CoV positive and negative amplification curves tend to overlap closely with one another (Fig. 1B). Therefore, clinicians less experienced in interpreting real-time PCR results can distinguish easily between positive and negative signals with the enhanced results obtained. The enhanced real-time PCR method results in a lowering of the cycle time (Ct) value for SARS-CoV positive samples compared with the conventional real-time PCR method. A Ct value of \u2a7d35.0 is a suitable cut-off for distinguishing unambiguously between samples containing SARS-CoV nucleic acid from those that do not. A minor limitation of this method is that it is not possible to quantify the amount of virus in each sample as the exponential increases in copy number during the pre-amplification stage masked the initial template concentration during the real-time amplification step.",

The limit of detection of the conventional PCR, standard real-time PCR, and the enhanced real-time PCR methods was equivalent to 2 \u00d7 10\u22125.5 TCID50/ml, 2 \u00d7 10\u221210.5 TCID50/ml (Fig. 1D), and 2 \u00d7 10\u221212.5 TCID50/ml (Fig. 1C), respectively. Thus, the enhanced real-time PCR method is at least 102-fold more sensitive than the standard real-time PCR and 107-fold more sensitive than any of the conventional PCR techniques currently used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV. Detection of SARS-CoV by viral culture may be the least sensitive method as shown in Table 2, where only 3/28 (10.7%) cases detected by enhanced real-time PCR were positive for SARS-CoV by viral culture.",

Of these six cases, four were reported to the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) as probable SARS and were included on lists of such cases submitted to the WHO. The other two cases had symptoms clinically compatible with pneumonia. Viral culture was negative in both cases. Neither case was reported to the DH as probable SARS. In one case (31,027), SARS was not excluded definitively. Note that virus was only cultured from 3/28 patients in whom SARS-CoV nucleic acid was demonstrated to be present by multiple PCR tests. In addition, serological data for the majority of these six patients were not available. Two cases reported to the DH as probable SARS are of particular interest. Patient 31,131 died from SARS. However, at the time of sampling SARS-CoV serology results were inconclusive (titre <40), possibly due to sampling prior to seroconversion. However, the enhanced real-time PCR method readily detected SARS-CoV nucleic acid in samples taken at the same time. For patient 31,146, samples taken on 22 April 2003 examined by conventional PCR and standard real-time PCR were negative for SARS-CoV. The enhanced real-time PCR was positive (Table 4). On 23 April 2003, the patient was sampled again and SARS-CoV was detected by conventional PCR (data not shown). Thus, one day makes a considerable difference in the ability of conventional PCR methods to detect SARS-CoV. A more sensitive detection method would clarify the clinical picture greatly and allow more focused treatment.",
