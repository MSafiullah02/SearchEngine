            "text": "Jinyinhua, a sprawling and twining lianas in the family of Caprifoliaceae, is a popular Chinese herbal medicine used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and as a well-known dietary supplement that has been used for many centuries. The medicinal part of the plant is the dried flower buds or flowers before blooming. The bloomed flowers undergo six stages, i.e. the juvenile bud stage, green stage, white stage, complete white stage, silver flowering stage, and golden flowering stage [1]. The color of the last two stages are silvery and golden respectively, so the medicinal material is called Jinyinhua becuase Jin means gold in Chinese, Yin means silver in Chinese and Hua means flower in Chinese. Although four other species of genus Lonicera, similar to Jinyinhua, have been used for medicinal purposes [2], only Thunb. has been used as a legal source of Jinyinhua, recorded in The Pharmacoepia of People\u2019s Republic of China [3]. As the typical botanical traits, L.\nhas young stems with pubescence; leaves ovate, elliptic, oblong or broadly lanceolate, blades 3\u20138 cm long, 1\u20133.5 cm wide; flowers in axillary cymes; corolla white, turning yellowish or tinged pink, 2-lipped. Figure 78.1 showed the flowering plant and crude drug of Lonicera japonica.\n",

Both wild and cultured materials are the source of supply. The flowers are typically harvested between May to June when they change from green to white and are in buds. The quality of medicinal materials will be lowered if the harvest is too early or too late. After drying 1\u20132 days and picking up impurities, cleaned and dried raw material can be obtained and marketed. During drying procedures, do not direcctly expose the flowers to strong sunlight because it will darken the flowers. Other processing methods are further performed for some specific medicinal purposes, such as fried Jinyinhua and charcoaled Jinyinhua etc. In recent years, sulfur-fumigation has been used to replace natural drying processing for efficiency and pest control [4].",

The content of luteoloside in the Jinyinhua should be not less than 0.05 %.

Due to the differences in harvesting time and processing technics, the contents and components of volatile oil are different. Existing research showed that the complete white and silver flower period are the preferable harvest times for volatile oil, which match with the best time to harvest for chlorogenic acid. Low temperature and no-lighting were in favor of the volatile oil in the dry and extract processes [1].",

            "text": "As described previously, Jinyinhua is one of widely used herbs in TCM, especially for almost all infectious diseases, due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. The two activities act synergistically to accelerate wound repair [8]. Moreover, the modern pharmacological studies showed that Jinyinhua and its active principles also possess the wide pharmacological actions, such as antiendotoxin, antipyretic, antihyperlipidemic, antithrombotic, anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic activities, and hepatoprotective etc. [1]. In addition, anti-lipase, insecticidal and acaricidal activities were also found in the crude extract of Jinyinhua. In recent years new bioactivities, such as the potent anti-Parkinsonism activity [9] and protecting neuronal cells against glutamate excitotoxicity via antioxidative activity [10], inhibition of the allergic contact dermatitis [11], and a possible use for antidiabetes, have been discovered and suggested to be in the compounds isolated from Jinyinhua due to its potent inhibitor action for maltase [12]. Researchers thought most of these effects may be related to the active compositions of volatile oil, chlorogenic acid, and flavones. Chlorogenic acid and luteoloside, officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb and its related preparations, were shown to have beneficial effects in the aspects of anti-oxidation and antitumor [1, 13]. Moreover, chlorogenic acid showed the antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic activities, and allergy-preventive properties [1, 14]. Meanwhile, luteolin, another major flavonoid in Jinyinhua, and volatile oil also showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. Luteolin has significant bioactivities in the aspects of antifibrotic and anti-5-lipoxygenase activities [6, 15]. Taken together, most of these activities matched to traditional usage.",
