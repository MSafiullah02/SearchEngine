Data from Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo [13] shows that, among approximately 200 pediatric liver transplant recipients controlled in this center, none had developed clinical pulmonary disease, despite 3 having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In our own experience, among approximately 420 children with a functioning kidney transplant controlled in pediatric nephrology departments in Spain, only 3 patients have been diagnosed with COVID-19.",

Based on experience with other viruses in the transplantation field, antimetabolites are typically reduced or discontinued, but calcineurin inhibitors are maintained if the clinical course is not severe. Evolutions have been favorable, even in cases with any modification that has been done. Antiviral treatment was prescribed according to general practice advice for the Spanish pediatric population [14] . One patient initially received lopinavir/ritonavir, but administration had to be stopped due to digestive intolerance; it was replaced with hydroxychloroquine. The other 8 patients were only treated with hydroxychloroquine. We must be careful when recommending a specific antiviral treatment for this group of patients, given that pharmacological interactions are very frequent. It is also important to remember that doses must to be adjusted to CKD degree.",

Hospitalization should be considered only when the clinical situation suggests it, and these patients can be managed as outpatients if close monitoring is possible.",
