Alphaviruses are classified based on their geographical distribution into New World (NW) and Old World (OW) alphaviruses [1] . OW alphaviruses are generally arthrogenic and include CHIKV and Sindbis virus, while NW alphaviruses such as VEEV, Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and Western equine encephalitis virus are characterized by an encephalitogenic phenotype [1, 2] . Alphaviruses replicate to very high titers in cell lines of mosquito and vertebrate origins and possess capability of storage in lyophilized form and their potential of spread in aerosol form makes them potential bioweapons [3] . Thus, these viruses are recognized as category B priority pathogens by the U.S. government. VEEV has caused major epidemics in several parts of the world involving a large number of equids and humans [4] . CHIKV has been documented to cause disease since 1953 but its explosive outbreak in 2005 in La R eunion Island involved an overwhelming number of 300 000 reported cases [5] . Since 2005, it has caused recurrent outbreaks in Asia and other parts of the world.

Capping of the viral genome is a vital step in the alphaviral life cycle as this cap structure plays numerous biological roles including the protection of mRNA from cellular exonucleases and efficient recognition of the RNA by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) for the initiation of translation [6] . Additionally, this cap structure also prevents recognition by members of the host innate immune pathways such as MDA5 and/or RIG-I [7] . Alphaviruses use a completely distinct molecular mechanism of capping of viral mRNA from the host cell. Cellular capping enzymes typically methylate GTP only after its transfer to the 5 0 end of the RNA. In contrast, the alphaviral capping enzyme, nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) caps viral RNA in two major steps: It first methylates GTP by transferring the methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which acts as the methyl donor, to GTP and the methylated m 7 GMP moiety gets covalently attached to the nsP1 enzyme transiently during a guanylation (GT) step [8] . S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) is generated as a coproduct of this methyltransferase (MTase) step of capping reaction. The aminoterminal of nsP2, another replication protein of alphavirus, harbors the RNA triphosphatase activity [9] . It contributes to the capping reaction of alphaviruses by cleaving the c,b-triphosphate bond specifically at the 5 0 end of the nascent RNA prior to the transfer of m 7 GMP to the nascent viral RNA by nsP1 in the guanylyltransferase (GTase) step. Mutational analyses of the protein and reverse genetics studies involving live virus showed that the abrogation of alphaviral nsP1 activity is detrimental to the viral growth proving that nsP1 capping activity is an essential step during viral replication [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 208, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 524, "end": 527, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 661, "end": 664, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1235, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1469, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1979, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Viruses within the alphavirus superfamily have been shown to replicate in membrane invaginations (spherules) in the host cell. nsP1 is also a vital component of the replication complex as it anchors the ensemble of nsPs and other replication factors on the membrane primarily through an amphipathic helix and secondarily through palmitoylation sites on the protein [11] [12] [13] . The three-dimensional structure of alphavirus nsP1 from any member of the alphavirus genus remains elusive. In the absence of the 3D structure of nsP1, the development of enzymatic assays for the screening or development of potent inhibitors targeting replication protein nsP1 is required. It will provide a platform for the identification and characterization of inhibitors of this viral enzyme for treating diseases caused by alphaviral infection. Lately, there has been a surge in the development of novel assays for nsP1 enzymatic activity to accentuate the pursuit of novel antiviral compounds. Previous efforts for the development of the assays for the biochemical characterization and inhibition assays against nsP1 were focussed on the GT step of the nsP1 enzymatic reaction [14] [15] [16] . Gel-based approach for inhibition study used a fluorescently labeled GTP (GTP-ATTO) for detection or western blot/ELISA uses antim 3 G/m 7 G-cap monoclonal antibodies for quantification of nsP1 enzymatic activity [14-16]. These immuno-based assays target GT activity inhibition, utilize expensive antibodies, and are labor-intensive and susceptible to the identification of false positives/false negatives. A fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay has also been developed for nsP1, which is used for screening of small molecules against CHIKV nsP1. This assay is based on monitoring the displacement of fluorescently labeled GTP analog by an inhibitory molecule [17] .

In contrast, when magnesium ion, which acts as a cofactor in the subsequent GT reaction, was present, the progress curve became nonlinear after 1 h (Fig. 4A) . It is speculated that the subsequent GT reaction that guanylate nsP1 might affect the activity of the enzyme by product inhibition. Hence, to decouple the MTase and GT reactions catalyzed by the same enzyme, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP with a b-c nonhydrolyzable bond, GIDP was used ( Fig. 4B and  4C ). The use of GIDP excludes the possibility of the guanylation of nsP1 that can interfere with the linearity of SAH formation over the reaction time.

The IC 50 values of sinefungin and ATA calculated by the CE-based nsP1 MTase assay are very similar to the ones reported earlier [34] .

As RNA capping is a critical point in the viral life cycle, nsP1 is a promising candidate for the development of therapeutic intervention against alphaviruses. MTase activity of recombinant nsP1 has been demonstrated with nsP1 from different alphaviruses including SINV and VEEV [34, 45] . Previous efforts to detect MTase activity of nsP1 were based on the detection of radioactive product which albeit are sensitive and more reliable than their alternatives, are time-consuming and cumbersome.

These are coupled assays wherein the SAH generated in the MTase reaction is subsequently acted upon by other enzymes included in the assay mixture. The final products of these coupled assays are then quantified by colorimetric or fluorometric detection. The coupled-assay approach is indirect and circumvents the problem of SAH accumulation, which can act as the potent inhibitor of the MTases [46] [47] [48] [49] . These enzyme assays, however, when used for inhibitor screening suffer from artefacts arising mainly because of the promiscuity of several compounds that interfere with the enzyme coupling system by off-target inhibition [50] . Inhibitors identified through such a screening strategy require a secondary assay for hit validation before being considered for follow-up studies. The CE method developed in this study holds several advantages such as simple sample preparation, low sample requirement, and low cost. It also eliminates the need for expensive and potentially hazardous radioactive materials. Moreover, the assay relies on the direct detection of SAH generated in the MTase reaction, thereby minimizing any possible interference from inhibitor compounds. This reported assay allows the rapid detection of MTase activity of nsP1 capping enzyme. Whole CE analysis takes 13 min including the buffer run between two runs and multiple samples can be analyzed at once with an automated injection procedure without any manual intervention in between consecutive runs. This assay can be used for batch screening of inhibitors and can be modified and adapted for fully automated in-line CE assays. Separation of m 7 GTP from the reaction mixture of H37A mutant using PVA capillary has been demonstrated in this study. Alanine substitution at this position disrupts the formation of the phosphoramide bond between nsP1 and m 7 GMP, and this supports the hypothesis that the alphaviral capping enzyme methylates GTP before it is hydrolyzed to GMP and transferred to the 5'-end of RNA unlike host capping enzymes [51] . nsP1, being an attractive drug target, can be effectively perturbed to feed the drug discovery pipeline for anti-alphaviral therapeutics. Sequence alignment reveals that the putative MTase domain or 'core region' of nsP1 [spanning from 28-259 amino acids in VEEV nsP1; [39, 40] ] is highly conserved within the alphavirus superfamily. The capping enzymes of alphaviruses share a high level of sequence homology, and thus, the development of nsP1 inhibitors can warrant pan-alphavirus therapeutics. Moreover, viruses from alphavirus-like superfamily, which includes several plant and animal viruses such as bamboo mosaic virus, brome mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, alfalfa mosaic virus, and hepatitis E virus, carry out capping of viral RNA using a mechanism similar to nsP1 [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . This nonradioactive assay provides a robust and versatile platform for screening and identification of novel inhibitors against these viral capping enzymes and other similar SAM-dependent MTases. Developed CE-based assay for MTase activity of nsP1 is based on the general detection method of SAH formed during the MTase reaction of alphavirus nsP1. Under our assay conditions, SAH accumulation in the MTase reaction was linear for at least 2 h. This is in agreement with the reports on VEEV and for SINV nsP1 [34, 45] . The same detection range was used for the characterization of inhibitors of nsP1.

To our knowledge, adenosine kinase was not implicated in CHIKV infection in this or any other study. Thus, host adenosine kinase seems to be not involved in alphavirus infection. Time-of-drug addition studies indicate that 5-IT affects an early, postentry replication step of the viral life cycle. Though extensive studies are required to identify other possible cellular or viral targets of 5-IT, at this stage it is reasonable to believe that antiviral effects of 5-IT are most likely, at least partially, can be attributed to the inhibition of alphaviral nsP1. Further studies are also needed for screening and improving the inhibition potency of compounds similar to 5-IT. In the absence of the structure of nsP1, it is rather difficult to establish a structure-activity relationship (SAR). Thus, at this point of time, we are not able to conjecture the interaction of different moieties of the compound with specific amino acid residues of nsP1. Chemical modification by addition or removal of chemical moiety/moieties may result in enhanced potency of 5-IT in terms of increased efficacy and improved pharmacokinetic properties. With the availability of the structure of nsP1 from the alphavirus genus, an extensive structure-activity study of 5-IT will be required to use it as a reference compound for rational drug designing and identification/development of more potent and specific therapeutic agents targeting nsP1 protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 147, "text": "[57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 148, "end": 151, "text": "58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 217, "end": 221, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 341, "end": 344, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 589, "end": 593, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, a simple, robust, and versatile CEbased assay for measuring MTase activity of VEEV and CHIKV nsP1 was developed. Favorable assay parameters for MTase activity of VEEV and CHIKV nsP1 viz pH, temperature, salt concentration, and metal ion (Mg 2+ ) concentration were optimized. For the mechanistic study of nsP1, m 7 GTP formation by H37A mutant of nsP1 was analyzed with the help of a PVA capillary using a separate CE method. The assay was further used to evaluate the IC 50 values of known nsP1 inhibitors, sinefungin, and ATA. Evaluation of enzymatic activity in the presence of potential inhibitors led to the identification of adenosine analog 5-IT as the inhibitor of MTase activity of the enzyme. The potent hit compound was further evaluated in a secondary orthogonal ELISA assay that quantitates m 7 GMP-nsP1 adduct formed after nsP1 GT activity. 5-IT showed a marked reduction in CHIKV replication as evident by the results of the plaque reduction assay, viral-induced CPE reduction, qRT-PCR, and IFA studies. The developed CE-based assay can further accelerate the screening of inhibitors against nsP1 of alphaviruses and identification or development of new antiviral drugs against alphaviruses. With the effective inhibition of CHIKV replication in cell culture by 5-IT, the possible new approach of targeting alphaviral nsP1 with adenosine analogs can be further investigated for identification and development of panalphavirus antiviral agents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Additional supporting information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article.
