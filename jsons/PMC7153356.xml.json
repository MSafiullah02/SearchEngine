            "text": "From the 1980s, Western governments began to realize that they could not tackle the social challenges they faced independently. Societal problems were too complex and governments\u2019 steering power too weak. The traditional view, in which the government is regarded as a controlling and regulatory organization that enables the functioning of society, increasingly appeared to be outdated (Peters and Pierre 1998). New Public Management arrived as the dominant praxis in administrative behavior. This implied that social welfare regimes gradually released their hierarchical role in policy fields from the 1980s onward to make way for a more market-oriented government. This can be seen, inter alia, in the privatization of large state enterprises and, for example, involving CSOs in policy formation and implementation. Later, a network approach in which public and private parties cooperate on societal challenges became the dominant modus operandi (Osborne 2010; Pestoff et al. 2012). These changes resulted in an increase in cooperative relationships between government actors and CSOs, which is expressed in terms of outsourcing, service provision, and co-production (Osborne et al. 2016).",

            "text": "The associated change in orientations within associations is not without consequences. Brandsen et al. (2014) found that cooperation between civil society and government in providing public services has led for many CSOs to a loss of contact with the traditional membership base and, consequently, their original legitimacy. CSOs gain that legitimacy, especially from below and from the inside, from its association members. But as an executive of public duties, associations might derive their legitimacy increasingly from the above and outside of the organization. Consequences are diverse. For patient associations, Van de Bovenkamp and Trappenburg (2011) found that their ideology, organizational structure, and activities changed as a result of closer links with national government. Smith and Lipsky (2009) note for non-profits that closer links with governments can lead, among other things, to more homogeneous services, thus reducing choices for citizens. In addition, Froelich (1999) argues that closer financial ties with the government can lead to a goal shift or the influx of a new clientele. Harris (2010, p. 35) has argued that CSOs \u2018find themselves under pressure to change their operating systems and structures so that they complement those of more powerful partners\u2019. This also links to the debate on managerialism in civil society studies (Claey\u00e9 and Jackson 2012; Hvenmark 2016; Kreutzer and J\u00e4ger 2011; Willner 2019). When management ideology inspired the change towards New Public Management in the public sector, it consequently altered expectations that governments had of CSOs internal operating practices being more business-like, or professional (Anheier 2009).",

This approach adds a microinstitutional perspective to the toolkit for institutional analysis. It sheds light on the interplay between institutional environments and the contested meaning over everyday activities, norms, and values within organizations. Thornton et al. (2012) argue that the institutional environment regulates behaviour, as well as creates opportunities for agency and change. When CSOs become involved in public service delivery, they are confronted with a public logic. The IWA draws attention to the embedded agency of individuals in CSOs in the way they organize the tensions between multiple logics (Pache and Santos 2013).",

How individuals cope with the uncertainty and complex dynamics of plural institutional logics and how they themselves create, maintain, or disrupt such logics are central questions in this body of literature (Lawrence et al. 2011: 55). It adds a microperspective to the toolkit for institutional analysis, bringing everyday ambiguous illustrations of agency into focus (Powell and Rerup 2017). According to Lawrence et al.

The study of institutional work takes as its point of departure an interest in work\u2014the efforts of individual and collective actors to cope with, keep up with, store up, tear down, tinker with, transform, or create anew the institutional structures within which they live, work, and play, and which give them their roles, relationships, resources, and routines.",

This definition is based on a multidimensional view of agency by Emirbayer and Mische (1998, in Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013). They distinguish three dimensions of agency. These are iteration (habit), projection (imagination), and practical evaluation (judgment) (Battilana and D\u2019Aunno 2009; Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013). Iteration focuses on the past and describes the selective reactivation of patterns of meanings and actions by actors, bringing stability and order to the social world and helping to preserve identities, interactions, and institutions through time (Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013: 1174). The projective dimension refers to \u2018the imaginative generation by actors of possible future trajectories of action, in which received structures of thought and action may be creatively reconfigured in relation to actors\u2019 hopes, fears and desires for the future\u2019 (Emirbayer and Mische 1998: 971; in Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013: 1174). The dimension of practical evaluation refers to the capacity of actors to respond to emerging dilemmas and ambiguous situations by making a practical and normative assessment of possible alternative courses of action (Battilana and D\u2019Aunno 2009; Raviola and Norb\u00e4ck 2013).",

The initial aim was to realize 2.250 fte of community sport coaches (CSC), as the professionals were called. After the CSC had proved itself a promising policy instrument, the policy programme was further developed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and continues to this date. In 2020, a total of 3.665 fte has been realized. At the outset, some output goals were: increase the number of primary and secondary schools with sport and cultural activities, especially in deprived areas, and strengthen about 10% of voluntary sport clubs (VSCs) to make them better able to perform their wider social role. The CSC is responsible for organizing after-school sport activities and is often seen as a solution for the absence of organized sport activities in (deprived) neighbourhoods.

Because someone who gets paid is really a completely different cost structure than what you normally have in the club\u2019. And in the case of a CSC, it\u2019s actually the case that such a person can start working fully subsidised. So uh\u2026 in that light we decided to make an application eh\u2026 to have someone like that start on January 1st. \u201c (GMM, 29-10-2011)",

In the excerpt above, the chairman mentions professionalization of the association as the part of the appointment of the CSC that concerns the \u2018internal aspect for the association\u2019. In this way the chairman identifies professionalization and connecting with external organizations as two separate responsibilities and organizational processes. At the end of the quote, the chairman refers to the financial construction of the CSC. The fully subsidized professional prompted the board to apply for a CSC. Thus, the CSC as a fully subsidized club manager who contributes to the professionalization of the club emerges as the dominant meaning of the CSC in the chairman\u2019s explanation at the general membership meeting.

In the selected case, a community logic is prevalent. The selected CSO contributes to the CSC programme, primarily from a community logic that focusses on competitiveness and managerialism (cf. Meyer et al. 2013; Skille 2011; Stenling and Fahl\u00e9n 2009). This can be viewed as prospective agency, hoping to boost its image as a professionally run sport club, to gain field level legitimacy and goodwill with the municipality (Meyer et al. 2013). The case shows an assimilation of elements of the public logic into the community logic. Members of the studied sport club only sparsely connect with such aims as increasing the overall sport participation in a specific neighbourhood or improving the social cohesion in that area. Furthermore, the VSC does not approach its surrounding environment in terms of public target groups, like immigrants or the elderly. Whatever their internal differences, what the club members shared was an instrumental motivation towards public policy objectives and an absence of intrinsic motivations for what one could call a wider social role for sport clubs (Waardenburg 2016). Such differences facilitate the resistance\u2014or disruptive institutional work\u2014towards a public logic as well as the assimilation of public policy objectives into the dominant community logic. This finding is in line with existing literature on VSCs as policy implementers, highlighting an implementation challenge due to the competitive orientation of most VSCs (Ibsen and Levinsen 2019; Skille 2011; Stenling and Fahl\u00e9n 2009; Waardenburg and Nagel 2019).",

Service provision has by now become part of the vocabularies and the activities of many CSOs (Brandsen and Pestoff 2006; McMullin and Skelcher 2018). From an institutional work approach, this can be interpreted as practice work; change occurs in the legitimized practices of CSOs. Through practice work, the studied CSO assimilates elements of a public logic, thereby maintaining a community logic. These findings correspond with the observation that plural logics can coexist alongside each other (Besharov and Smith 2014; Kraatz and Block 2008; Skelcher and Smith 2015; Skirstad and Chelladurai 2011).

            "text": "The application of IWA also highlights the double-sided relation between service provision and managerialism. Previous studies predominantly describe this relationship as unidirectional. When CSOs become involved in service delivery, expectations about their managerial ability rise. Thus, managerialism has often been addressed as a consequence of adopting a role as service provider by CSOs (Cairns et al. 2005; Harris 2010). The case analysis shows another possible connection that managerialism in a CSO triggers the openness to and adoption of a service delivery role. An important reason for CSOs to cooperate with government for service provision is securing strategic resources and increasing goodwill (Sowa 2009; Willner 2019). While the studied CSO is not financially dependent on the municipality, members evaluate subsidies as a possibility to finance the professionalization of their association. Government subsidies are perceived as an alternative financial model to realize the appointment of a club manager. Governments and commercial activities increasingly provide possibilities for financing the professionalization of VSCs. Studies into other types of CSOs show that the professionalization of the association through paid professionals could put VSCs for new financial and other organizational challenges (Billis 2010; Cairns et al. 2005). According to Billis (2010), taking on the first paid staff should be seen as a form of shallow hybridity. Often such modest hybridity arises from the desire to extend the range of activities. Public instruments and activities thus form an instrument for CSOs to position themselves vis-\u00e0-vis external stakeholders. The findings of this study suggest that the agentic position towards this public logic delineates the specific form (e.g. segregating, assimilating, blending) the process of hybridization takes (see also McMullin and Skelcher 2018).",

First, this study provides what has been dubbed analytic generalizable insights, not empirically generalizable results (Thomas and Myers 2015). Thus, what was observed in the case study cannot readily be transferred to other sports clubs or CSOs without careful consideration of those organizational contexts. A second limitation is that the case revolves around a specific policy instrument, the Community Sport Coach. As such, the case study was limited to those persons that were most directly involved with deciding on and implementing this policy instrument and related services, and not the whole membership base of the club. This may have decreased the possibility of generating a broad range of experiences and could have added another layer of understanding why professionalization, competitiveness, and managerialism are such strong forces in the organization. Another limitation of the study is the context of the voluntary sport sector, with its relatively strong focus on competitiveness. This field-specific dominant logic in sports could mean that other civil society sectors might be less able to maintain a community logic. This is something up for further research.",

In what ways do CSOs in e.g. human services, health, or religious sectors enact their interactions with government at a microlevel? And what does institutional work entail for this relationship when focusing our attention to more authoritative regimes (e.g. Skokova et al. 2018) or advocacy-oriented CSOs? Such research might be based on similar in depth single case studies, multiple single sector case studies, or comparative multiple sector case studies. All types of case study design have the ability to tighten our grip on the microfoundations of government\u2013civil society interactions. Another approach could consist of qualitative longitudinal research (e.g. Chen 2009). Whilst the chosen timeframe for this study provides sufficient depth for our current conclusions, it remains to be seen how the studied relationship further develops, especially when public policy objectives and/or instruments change over time. This could provide a better understanding which policy instruments are considered more impactful for CSOs and how they enable or disable their microlevel endeavours in institutional work.",

Members of the organization under study initially respond positively to government\u2019s call for service provision, in line with a previously iterated desire for professionalization. Members see in the CSC programme a projective opportunity for the development of their own organization. They are willing to commit themselves to a broader clientele in exchange for public funds that help them to achieve their competitive ambitions and run the organization in a more managerial fashion. CSOs certainly are no passive bystander in the service delivery relationship. By assimilating elements of a public logic, the case organization institutionally maintains its community logic. The study illustrated the usefulness of the institutional work approach in further understanding government\u2013CSOs interactions and dissect the multivocality of these interactions.",
