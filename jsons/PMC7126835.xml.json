Total world revenue traffic (international and domestic, passenger and cargo) on scheduled airlines in 2006 exceeded 510 billion revenue tonne kilometres (RTK),1\nwhich included almost four trillion revenue passenger kilometres (RPK).2\nIn the same year, total revenues of the scheduled airlines of the parties to the Convention on International Civil Aviation of December 1944 (Chicago Convention) topped US$450 billion, more than 120 per cent above 1990 levels (ICAO, 2007a).",

However, these benefits would come at a cost, most notably a significant increase in aviation greenhouse gas emissions. While aviation is not currently one of the main drivers of global warming, the growth trajectory of the industry suggests it could become a significant factor over the coming decades. A report prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999 at the request of the ICAO found that civil aviation carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions could rise by between 60 per cent and over 1000 per cent between 1992 and 2050 (IPCC, 1999). More recent research suggests that if strong global economic growth continues, aviation CO2 emissions are likely to experience a greater than three-fold increase between 2000 and 2050 (Berghof et al., 2005; Horton, 2006). Concerns about rapid growth in the industry and the associated threat to the climate system have prompted debate about the future of aviation.",

Governments opposed to these initiatives have also raised questions about the legality of international aviation emission levies and measures that seek to unilaterally impose carbon prices on the extraterritorial emissions of foreign aircraft. The aviation industry has voiced similar concerns. Like many governments, the industry's current position is that it is opposed to emission levies, but supports emissions trading subject to certain conditions (e.g. it is introduced on the basis of mutual consent between participating nations and that the schemes are open and allow for permits to be traded with other sectors) (International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2008a, International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2008b).",

International transport involves movements between countries, creating a problem for the standard accounting system. Further, under international aviation law, each country has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above their territory. Beyond their territorial airspace, the capacity of a country to regulate aircraft is limited and is subject to the body of law associated with the Chicago Convention and related bilateral air service agreements. Due to these issues, ICAO was seen as the appropriate body for addressing international aviation emissions.",

As discussed, there is also an ongoing dispute about the legality of emission levies and the capacity of a country to unilaterally impose carbon prices on the extraterritorial emissions of foreign aircraft. In addition, there are debates about how international aviation emissions should be allocated between countries and the most appropriate design of an emissions trading scheme that applies to the sector. The political problems that have hindered progress on international aviation emissions are not unique. However, the legal, accounting and policy design issues that arise in this context set it apart from most other areas, including domestic aviation.

GWPs are a measure of the cumulative radiative forcing associated with a unit mass of the relevant direct greenhouse gas when compared to the same mass of CO2 over a specified period (typically 100 years) (IPCC, 2001). They are not calculated for H2O and indirect greenhouse gases like CO and NOx because of the variable nature of the relevant climate impacts (Forster et al., 2006; IPCC, 2001).

To do so, CO2 emissions from aviation are multiplied by the uplift factor to provide an estimate of the total impact of aviation emissions in CO2-e. There is debate about the appropriateness of uplift factors and their use in policy processes. Questions have also been raised about what uplift factor should be applied. Recent studies indicate that the appropriate uplift factor could range between 1.7 and 5.1 times aviation CO2 emissions depending on the timescales of the analysis (Forster et al., 2006; Sausen et al., 2005).

As discussed in Section 3, aviation non-CO2 emissions (particularly NOx and H2O) have important climate impacts and are believed to account for 50\u201380 per cent of the current warming associated with aviation. If an uplift factor of 1.7 is used to estimate total CO2-e emissions, the emission intensity model suggests international aviation emissions will be between 1488\u20131722 Mt in 2025. While the use of uplift factors is controversial, these figures illustrate the potential magnitude of the total climate impacts associated with international aviation.",

            "text": "The results for S1 and S2 from the emission intensity model are at the higher end of previous international aviation emission projections. Olsthoorn (2001) projected that international aviation CO2 emissions will be 86\u2013144 per cent above 1995 levels by 2020 (or 383\u2013503 Mt) and 187\u2013513 per cent above 1995 levels by 2050 (591\u20131263 Mt) if carbon is not priced. These results suggest that by 2025, emissions will be approximately 100\u2013190 per cent above 1995 levels (\u223c410\u2013600 Mt CO2). In comparison, the emission intensity model predicts that emissions will be 150\u2013190 per cent above 1995 levels in 2025 (876\u20131013 Mt CO2). The results from Olsthoorn's (2001) low and high emission growth scenarios (the Ecological and Schumpter scenarios (marked \u2018OE\u2019 and \u2018OS\u2019 respectively)) are shown in Fig. 5\n, along side the results from the emission intensity model. Much of the difference in absolute numbers is attributable to Olsthoorn's (2001) lower estimate of emissions in 1995 (206 Mt CO2 compared to the latest IEA estimate of 306 Mt CO2). In relation to the proportional increases, the emission intensity model results overlap the upper end of the range in Olsthoorn (2001). The higher estimates from the emission intensity model are due mainly to differences in economic growth rates, which are a major determinant of aviation demand. The scenarios in Olsthoorn (2001) assumed annual global real GDP growth of 1.6\u20133.1 per cent. The ICAO traffic forecast used in the emission intensity model assumed real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent to 2025.",

The report, which was prepared for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), projected scheduled domestic and international aviation CO2 emissions over the period 2000\u20132050. The traffic forecasts prepared by the FESG for the sixth meeting of ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/6) were used as the basis for the projections to 2020 (Wickrama et al., 2003). Traffic forecasts for 2020\u20132050 were developed using a non-linear Verhulst logistic model derived from the historical relationship between aviation traffic and GDP between 1960 and 1995. The model was applied using the GDP growth rates from the IPCC's A1 and B2 SRES scenarios. The results suggest that scheduled international aviation CO2 emissions will increase from approximately 240 Mt in 2000, rising to 264 Mt in 2005, then 540 Mt in 2020 and to between 666 and 808 Mt in 2030. These results suggest scheduled international aviation CO2 emissions will be approximately 600\u2013675 Mt in 2025 (\u223c150\u2013180 per cent above 2000 levels). The emission intensity model indicates that emissions will be 141\u2013179 per cent above 2000 levels in 2025. The results from Owen and Lee's (2006) A1 and B1 scenarios are marked on Fig. 5 as \u2018OL-A1\u2019 and \u2018OL-B1\u2019, respectively. The differences between the Owen and Lee (2006) projections and those from the current study are primarily due to a lower base year fuel quantity estimate in Owen and Lee (2006) and differences in scope (i.e. Owen and Lee (2006) exclude non-scheduled traffic, which is likely to have reduced their estimates by approximately 10 per cent).",

International aviation CO2 emissions are only likely to stay below this level if one or more of the following events occur: a prolonged global economic slowdown; an international shock, such as a major international conflict, pandemic or a substantial increase in the price of oil; or the emergence and rapid deployment of new emission saving technology. While more efficient aircraft are currently being rolled out (e.g. A380 and B787), the fuel efficiency gains associated with the latest generation of aircraft are unlikely to be sufficient to offset the increases in international demand. Moreover, international aircraft have relatively long commercial lifetimes (typically 15\u201335 years) (ICAO, 2007c). Without aggressive policy measures to promote the deployment of state-of-the-art technology, the slow rate of turnover in the fleet will hinder progress on curbing emissions growth.",

These projections are at the upper end of previous estimates, primarily because of an increase in forecast economic growth, higher base year emission estimates and broader coverage. It should also be emphasised that they are confined to CO2 emissions and do not account for emissions of other gases and particles like H2O and NOx. If an uplift factor of 1.7 is used to estimate total CO2-e emissions, the emission intensity model suggests international aviation emissions will be between 1488 and 1722 Mt in 2025.",
