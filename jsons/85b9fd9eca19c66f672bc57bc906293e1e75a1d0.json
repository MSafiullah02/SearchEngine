At the moment, the reproduction ratio r is estimated to be below the threshold behavior of r = 1, but still close to 1, meaning that although the number of new cases are decelerating, a careful monitoring of the development of the outbreak is required. Besides projections on the national health system needs during the increased population demand on hospital admissions, models were able to describe COVID-19 epidemic in the Basque Country, from introduction to control measure response and are now being used to monitor disease transmission when the country lockdown is gradually lifted. These are the first made public available modeling results for the Basque Country and the efforts will be continued taking into consideration the updated data and new information that are generated over time.",

By incorporating the new information generated by virology, field epidemiology and social behaviour, for example, mathematical models are often used to guide public health authorities with projections for the national health systems needs during an outbreak. Those mathematical models also provide insights about the disease spreading over time, assessing the impact of human interventions for disease control, and Governments in some countries have already taking important decisions based on these results [12, 13, 14] . Worldwide country lockdowns are unprecedented draconian measures recently taken and, although needed to decelerate disease transmission, have caused a huge economical crises around the globe. As some countries on the northern hemisphere start to announce that they were able to control the spreading of the disease and have now \"reached the peak\" of the epidemic, Governments start to consider to relax the imposed restrictions, and once again, mathematical models become essential guiding tools to evaluate the impact of the ongoing partial lockdowns lifting on disease transmission intensities, for different epidemiological scenarios, combined with many other public health measures that must take place for continuing COVID-19 prevention and 3 mitigation such as testing, contact tracing and isolation of infected individuals.",

With valuable results, modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 is very challenging, as we know very little about the disease. More complex models would be able to give more accurate projections about specific variables such as number of hospitalizations, intensive care units admissions (ICUs) and deaths, for example, over the course of the epidemics. However, to build useful models, good quality empirical data and its understanding, as well as a close collaboration among mathematical modelers, field and laboratory researchers as well as public health stakeholders are essential [16, 17, 18, 19] .",

BMTF is a modeling team, working on different approaches, including statistical methods and artificial intelligence. Members were collaborating taking into consideration all information provided by the public health front-line and using different available datasets in respect to the COVID-19 outbreak in the Basque Country. The objectives were, besides projections on the national health system needs during the increased population demand on hospital admissions, the description of the epidemic in terms of disease spreading and control, as well as monitoring the disease transmission when the country lockdown was gradually lifted. All modeling approaches were complimentary and were able to provide coherent results, assuring that the decisions made using the modeling results were sound and, in fact, adjusted to the current epidemiological data. In addition, modeling results provided useful predictive information to validate outbreak control decisions and finally, to assist authorities in the Basque Country.

The cumulative incidence for all positive cases follow the higher stochastic realizations range instead and this variation can be interpreted by the increased testing capacities, since March 22, 2020. From April 6, 2020, rapid tests were introduced and since then the new positive cases were reported using the results from both tests, often performed in parallel, specially in nursing homes and for frontline public health workers, not easily differentiated in the anonymous \"positive cases\" data set available to us. Therefore, besides the expected increment in the number of positive tested cases, including sub-clinical infections and eventually asymptomatic individuals, we expect to have some overlap and double notification occurring on the used data set, maybe explaining to some extent the deviation observed between model simulations and data.",

At the moment, the reproduction ratio r is estimated to be below the threshold behavior of r = 1, but still close to 1, meaning that although the number of new cases reported in the Basque Country are decelerating, the outbreak is still in its linear phase and careful monitoring of the development of the dynamics of the new cases from all variables and respectively all data sets is required.

For this scenario, growth rates for all variable give a more accurate indication for the impact of the control measures implemented and future monitoring during the country's lockdown gradual lifting. The growth rate for each variable was calculated using the data available from March 4 to April 20, 2020. Tested positive cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions were shown to be synchronized, becoming negative on April 1, 2020, whereas recovered and deceased cases only follow later, reaching negative growth rate on April 7 and April 11, 2020, respectively. This analysis lead to a model refinement to synchronize ICU admissions to hospitalizations and positive tested infected, rather than to deceased and recovered. All 5 variables are now well described by the refined model, with the empirical data lying in the median range of stochastic realizations with one single parameter set, especially hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deceased.",

However, the severity rate \u03b7 is well restricted between 0.2 and 0.7 and a clear maximum visible around the best value from the individual liklihood plot, Fig. 3 e) . The boundary value of \u03be = 1 has a non-vanishing probability to explain the data, but numerically the value of L there is much smaller than the values in the middle of the parameter intervals of \u03b7 and \u03be. Hence, even with higher numerical resolution, on the expense of many more stochastic runs of the model, it is not expected to have high values of L(\u03b7, \u03be) still at locations close to the bundaries of the possible parameter values. So there are considerable correlations between these two parametes detected, but they seem to be mild, and from the available data we can obtain good information also about the most likely values of these parameters. Finally, for the parameter combination of L(\u03c6, \u03be) we observe again a more restricted area of possible parameter sets, though also here some correlations are visible. In conclusion, it seems that the available data sets give quite some information about the possible parameter combinations to describe the system under investigation. Further refinements of these analyses might give further insight into the dynamics of the epidemic.",

The present two parameter likelihood plots become occasionally very computationally demanding, depending on system size N and numbers of transitions, especially for larger infectivity. hence the well tested approximation via the Fokker-Planck equation as stochastic differential equation system [40] speeds up the simulations, allowing for smoother likelihoods, but occasionally might give some errors in the small number situations. A carefull monitoring is therefor needed, see a first comparison of master equation likelihoods, using Eq. (3), with stochastic differential equation likelihoods, using Eq. (16), with encouraging results Fig. 13 , but need to be further investigated in future studies. However, the first results given here in Figs. 11 and 12 are already informative for the purpose of detecting eventual correlations between parameters, and encouraging for further intensive studies. The up to now detected correlations keep well within the expected ranges indicated from the one parameter numerical likelihood plots in Fig. 3 .",
