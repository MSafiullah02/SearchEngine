We review each element of the ICU liberation bundle, including pediatric support data, as well as tips and strategies for implementation in a pediatric ICU (PICU) setting. Recent Findings Numerous studies have found children have cognitive, physical, and psychiatric deficits after a PICU stay. The effects of the full ICU liberation bundle in children have not been published, but in adults, bundle implementation (even partial) resulted in significant improvement in survival, mechanical ventilation use, coma, delirium, restraint-free care, ICU readmissions, and post-ICU discharge disposition. Summary Although initially described in adults, children also suffer from PICS. The ICU liberation bundle is feasible in children and may ameliorate the effects of a PICU stay. Further studies are needed to characterize the benefits of the ICU liberation bundle in children.",

Through advances in mechanical support, medications, and procedures, mortality has been greatly reduced [2] , but many pediatric survivors of critical illnesses will experience long-term disabilities, higher readmission rates, and overall poorer health status [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Such knowledge of the harm of an ICU stay, initially described in the adult ICU population, led the movement to reevaluate ICU clinical practice patterns and culture. With increasing awareness of the long-term detriments of an ICU stay, the term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was coined to describe the combination of negative cognitive, psychological, and physical effects after critical illness [9, 10\u2022] .",

Several studies have described significant motor deficits and exacerbation of baseline physical disabilities in children post-ICU stay [4, 6, 16] . A systematic review published in 2017 found 19 studies documenting deficits in all three PICS domains in PICU survivors [12] . Although these pediatric cohort studies have found significant morbidities, it is difficult to compare data and estimate a true incidence due to varied outcomes scales and measures [12] . In addition to patient deficits, parents or family members of critically ill children can experience depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as well [13, 17] .",

A compelling body of literature, mostly adult, surfaced to support several changes in clinical care to ameliorate PICS and the effects of an ICU stay. The ICU Liberation Collaborative was a quality improvement initiative hosted by the Society of Critical Care Medicine among 76 hospitals (67 adult and 9 pediatric) formed to implement and assess changes in clinical practice aimed at improving patient outcomes. The collaborative worked to integrate the ICU liberation bundle, also known as the ABCDEF bundle, in the care of their patients to mitigate the effects of an ICU stay [10\u2022] . Bundle implementation resulted in substantial improvements among adult ICU patients [18\u2022\u2022, 19] . In two large multicenter studies at varied types of ICUs [18\u2022\u2022, 19] , even partial bundle implementation resulted in improvement in survival, mechanical ventilation use, coma, delirium, restraint-free care, ICU readmissions, and post-ICU discharge disposition. Furthermore, the data supported a dose-response relationship, in which a higher proportion of bundle compliance correlated with improved clinical outcomes. Although pediatric data is limited, these results have further supported the use of the ABCDEF bundle in all ICU patients, including PICU patients.",

A key first step in managing pain is to correctly assess a patient's pain level. Self-report is a reliable indicator of pain; however, it has been shown that a large proportion of pediatric patients in the PICU are unable to self-report their pain [20] . The heterogenous ages and developmental levels of the patients, in addition to the use of invasive support, can make adequate pain assessment challenging. To ameliorate this, a reliable and valid pain scale, appropriate for different ages, should be used for assessing pain and titrating medications when self-reporting is not possible.",

In practice, systematic usage of SBT leads to earlier discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and it has been shown that up to 77% of critically ill adult patients who tolerated SBT were able to be successfully extubated [30] . While similar outcome data for SBT does not yet exist in pediatrics, and there remains controversy over both the optimal technique to perform an SBT and the criteria defining a successful SBT, investigation is currently underway in pediatrics.",

One such option to systematically assess a patient's sedation requirements and ability to be more awake while mechanically ventilated is through a trial of daily sedation interruption, or a \"sedation holiday.\" This daily sedation interruption is often referred to as a spontaneous awakening trial (SAT). A SAT used alone or paired together with SBT has been shown to lead to earlier discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, decreased ICU length of stay, and improved 1-year survival in critically ill adult patients [28\u2022, 32] .",

Once agreed upon criteria are established, trial a huddle each morning to discuss which of the current patients in the PICU meet criteria.

The clinical symptomatology of delirium can be difficult to distinguish from pain and iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome, which makes the use of a validated screening tool paramount in its diagnosis (Fig. 1) . Preventing and managing delirium therefore starts with a careful identification of triggers and the underlying etiology. There is a paucity of evidence to truly guide the prevention and management of pediatric delirium. Studies in adult ICU patients have shown that implementation and adherence to the ABCDEF liberation bundle had a significantly lower risk of delirium [18\u2022\u2022] . Recent studies in adults have shown that antipsychotics are not effective in significantly decreasing the duration of delirium [60] . Antipsychotics can be helpful for symptomatic management when a child continues to experience delirium despite the optimal management of the underlying illness and minimizing iatrogenic triggers. Although this represents offlabel use, quetiapine was shown to be safe and effective in a randomized controlled trial [61] , and case studies suggest the same for risperidone and olanzapine [62] [63] [64] .",

With effective education on the safety and feasibility of bundle implementation [79, 81] and ongoing feedback to providers with up to date data on how usage of the bundle is helping their patients, providers can feel empowered and motivated to lead bundle reliability performance. Involving multidisciplinary bedside providers and other key stakeholders early on during protocol design is also essential to ensure protocol feasibility and will help buy-in. Another frequently encountered barrier to protocol implementation is resource limitations, especially the availability of personnel such as physical and respiratory therapists, and equipment. Support and engagement of senior health care executive can help secure and allocate the appropriate resources.",

Further emphasis should be placed on investigating the effect the ICU liberation bundle, as well as each individual bundle element, has on survival and morbidity related to critical illness in pediatrics. Similarly, PICS may be a significant issue for survivors of pediatric illness and their families, but no unified scales exist in the literature to be able to truly quantify the incidence of this problem. Unified outcomes scales are needed in order to better understand both the factors that predispose patients to developing PICS as well as improve long-term outcomes from those affected by PICS after hospital discharge.",

One novel and developing approach to improving the lives of survivors of critical illness is the development of ICU follow-up clinics. This outpatient support has been used as part of post-ICU recovery models for some adult units after ICU discharge, though its impact on recovery remains largely unknown. This intervention has not been adopted widely, nor has it been studied extensively in the pediatric population. With advances in technology and the availability of telemedicine services, future research should explore whether a model for ICU follow-up can further improve the after-ICU recovery for critically ill pediatric patients and their families.",
