We investigate how the geographical distance of working adults to the epicenter of Wuhan predicts their burnout -emotional, physical and mental exhaustion due to excessive and prolonged stress. Preliminary results of a survey of 308 working adults in 53 cities showed working adults' distance to the epicenter of Wuhan had an inverted U-shaped relationship with their burnout. Such results help to identify regions where people may need more psychiatric assistance, with direct implications for healthcare practitioners and policymakers.",

By February 2020, almost all people in China had their lives and work disrupted (Zhang et al., 2020) , running the risk of burnout -emotional, physical and mental exhaustion due to excessive and prolonged stress of being overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and incapable of meeting constant demands (Maslach and Leiter, 2016) .

Two days later, on January 22, China decided to shut down Wuhan, stopping all modes of transport by the morning of the next day. However, on the night of January 22, about 300,000 people left Wuhan by train alone. About 70% of the them left Wuhan for other locations within the same province; 14% went to the neighboring provinces, and the rest travelled further (Kinetz, 2020) . The virus spread across China. We conducted a survey as in Zhang et al., 2020 on February 20-21, 2020 of working adults at locations that vary in their travel distance from Wuhan. We reached 410 adults, and 308 of them answered the survey, with a response rate of 75.1%. All respondents agreed to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee at Tongji University (#20200211).",

The inverse U-shaped relationship that we found was limited to predicting burnout, a psychological syndrome under prolonged social stressors, and it is interesting to examine how the distance to the epicenter predicts other mental health outcomes. The inverse U-shaped relationship is also limited to China, which had one clear epicenter in Wuhan, where Covid-19 originated. China is also a geographically large country, in which the epicenter of Wuhan happens to be centrally located. Hence, the ripple effect and the typhoon eye effect may play out differently in other countries with multiple epicenters of Covid-19, such as Washington State and New York State in the US, and with distinct geographical features. Nonetheless, our results point to the need for further studies to determine how the two effects may dominate each other in other Covid-19 infected areas to enable better identification of those who are in greater need of mental health care.",
