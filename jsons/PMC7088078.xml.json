Viral vaccination programs are coming under increased scrutiny, including the current smallpox vaccination, with concerns about the occurrence of complications in people with immunodeficiency disorders. Additionally, a new climate appears to be emerging in which the acceptance of the risks inherent to vaccines is very low, the most recently casualty of this being the rotavirus vaccine [2]. Antivirals also have an advantage because they are likely to be active against a new pandemic variant, unlike viral vaccines which are generally strain specific.",

Polymeric drugs can act either as the drug or as a means to release the drug over a period of time. Controlled or prolonged release of the drug allows a decreased amount of the drug to be present at any one time in normally sensitive sites such as the kidneys and liver, and increases the amount of drug remaining within the target site(s). For instance, tumor-associated vasculatures are frequently hyperpermeable to plasma proteins and other macromolecules [6\u201310]. These leaky vasculatures and limited lymphatic drainage, typical of tumor and missing in normal tissue, result in the accumulation of macromolecules such as polymeric drugs in the interstitial space of a large variety of tumors. This effect is known as the \u201cenhanced permeability and retention effect\u201d, EPR. Trapped polymeric drugs can then act over a longer time as polymeric drugs themselves or in controlled release of the active drug. This continuous release of bioactive drugs is crucial for cell-cycle-specific drugs as well as for reducing drug resistance.",

Our research with platinum-containing drugs has focused on polymeric derivatives of cisplatin as anticancer drugs [4, 38\u201344]. Most of these polymeric drugs inhibit cancer cell growth within the same concentration range as cisplatin itself (1) and are less toxic than cisplatin [4]. For instance, a typical upper dosage of cisplatin (single dose) is about 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 g/kg for humans which is increased to about 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 when flushing is employed. For rats the LD50 (ipr-rat) is 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 g/kg. We have injected mice on an alternate day schedule for 1 month DMSO-water (10\u221290% by volume) solutions containing 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 g/kg per dose without apparent harm using the cisplatin derivative from 1,6-hexanediamine [4].",

The bands at 324 and 286 (all bands are given in cm\u22121) are assigned to the Pt\u2013Cl stretch and correspond to literature values of 332 and 282 for cisplatin itself. [53\u201357] The band at about 512 corresponds to the band reported at 508 for the symmetrical Pt\u2013N stretch and the band at about 528 corresponds to the band at 517 for the Pt\u2013N asymmetrical stretch in cisplatin. [53\u201357] The presence of two Pt\u2013N stretching bands is also significant since their presence is consistent with a cis geometry about the platinum atom [4]., [53\u201357] Trans geometries are found to exhibit only one Pt\u2013N stretching band. Further, only the formation of a cis geometry from reaction of the tetrachloroplatinate with mono and diamines has been reported because of the so-called trans effect [4, 53\u201360] C\u2013H associated distortion bands appear at about 1,470, 1,410, and 1,390 in the monomer and about 1,465, 1,410, and 1,390 in the polymer. C\u2013H stretching frequencies for both aromatic and aliphatic appear about 3,055, 2,978, and 2,942 for tilorone and 3,022, 2,980, and 2,943 for the tilorone polymer. C\u2013N stretching occurs at 1,057 and 1,013 for the tilorone itself and 1,048 and 1,012 for the tilorone polymer. Thus, infrared spectral analysis is consistent with the presence of both the tilorone or tilorone 11,567 and platinum units as well as the formation of the Pt\u2013N bonds.",

For comparison with some of the other polymeric cisplatin drugs made by us, the polymers derived from 1,6-hexanediamine and 1,4-phenylenediamine show GI50 values of about 40 \u03bcg/mL against L929 cells [41].

Tilorone is mostly used as an antiviral agent as its hydrochloride. It is the first recognized synthetic, low-molecular-weight compound that is an orally active interferon inducer, and is also reported to have anti-neoplastic and anti-inflammatory actions [44, 66\u201369]. Tilorone hydrochloride has been shown to inhibit HSV-1 and vaccinia at concentrations of 10 \u03bcg/mL [70, 71]. The researchers noted that the adsorption of the virus was not affected by the drug, and the penetration of the deoxyribonucleic acid of the input virus into the cytoplasm and nuclei proceeded normally when tilorone hydrochloride was present. However, newly synthesized viral deoxyribonucleic acid was not detectable under these conditions and there was a remarkable decrease in the rate of viral polypeptide synthesis. Further, virus particles were not formed. They noted that the inhibition of herpes virus growth by tilorone hydrochloride was dependent on the presence of the drug in the cultures. Pretreatment of the cells with the drug did not result in resistance to herpes virus infection after the removal of the drug. The researchers tested a number of ssRNA viruses and no antiviral activity was measured. By comparison, we do see activity against a dsRNA virus, reovirus. This is not unexpected because reovirus, like a number of RNA viruses, requires cellular DNA synthesis to take place prior and/or during viral replication [72]. Tilorone, by inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis, can and does inhibit the replication of a number of DNA and RNA viruses.",

Inhibition of HSV-1 by acyclovir requires a concentration level of about 0.08 \u03bcg/mL and 2 \u03bcg/mL for VZV. This compares to a concentration about 10 \u03bcg/mL for the tilorone-Pt polymers against both of these viruses. But, in comparing the MIC values for acyclovir for Reovirus ST3 (>250 \u03bcg/mL) and Vaccinia WR (>200 \u03bcg/mL) the two tilorone polymers have much lower MIC values (10\u201320 \u03bcg/mL for Reovirus ST3 and 8\u201317 \u03bcg/mL for Vaccinia WR. Thus, the two tilorone polymers are broader acting antiviral agents in comparison to acyclovir and show promise as additional antiviral agents in the treatment against viral infections.",
