            "text": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a carboxypeptidase that shares 42% amino acid homology with ACE. Little is known about the regulation or pattern of expression of ACE2 in the mouse lung, including its definitive cellular distribution or developmental changes. Based on Northern blot and RT-PCR data, we report two distinct transcripts of ACE2 in the mouse lung and kidney and describe a 5 0 exon 1a previously unidentified in the mouse. Western blots show multiple isoforms of ACE2, with predominance of a 75-80 kDa protein in the mouse lung versus a 120 kDa form in the mouse kidney. Immunohistochemistry localizes ACE2 protein to Clara cells, type II cells, and endothelium and smooth muscle of small and medium vessels in the mouse lung. ACE2 mRNA levels peak at embryonic day 18.5 in the mouse lung, and immunostaining demonstrates protein primarily in the bronchiolar epithelium at that developmental time point. In murine cell lines ACE2 is strongly expressed in the Clara cell line mtCC, as opposed to the low mRNA expression detected in E10 (type I-like alveolar epithelial cell line), MLE-15 (type II alveolar epithelial cell line), MFLM-4 (fetal pulmonary vasculature cell line), and BUMPT-7 (renal proximal tubule cell line). In summary, murine pulmonary ACE2 appears to be primarily epithelial, is developmentally regulated, and has two transcripts that include a previously undescribed exon.",

The ACE2 gene is highly conserved in non-vertebrates and mammals [Chou et al., 2006] and has 18 well-characterized exons. In humans a 19th exon of ACE2 (exon 1a, National Institutes of Health GenBank accession No. AB193259) has recently been identified as well [Itoyama et al., 2005] . The murine and human ACE2 genes are both located on chromosome X and share 83% nucleotide identity [Komatsu et al., 2002] . There is potential for multiple splice variants of ACE2, as has been described in the homologous gene ACE that has distinct somatic and testicular isoforms [Soubrier et al., 1988] . Komatsu et al. [2002] have previously reported two transcripts of 2.8 and 2.0 kilobases (kb) of ACE2 (AB053181 and AB053182, respectively) produced by alternate splicing in the mouse lung and kidney. The GenBank includes two additional mRNA transcripts of murine ACE2 of 2,739 bp (BC026801) and 3,268 bp (NM_027286); the larger transcript differs primarily in the addition of untranslated 3 0 sequence to the end of exon 18.",

Analyses of proteins produced by cell lines transduced with human ACE2 mRNAs indicate that the differences in molecular weight are attributable to variable glycosylation and cleavage events, with the 120 kDa form representing the membrane-bound, fully glycosylated protein, the 105 and 95 kDa forms representing partial glycosylation of the shed N-terminal ectodomain, and the 80 and 85 kDa forms representing the deglycosylated shed and membrane-bound proteins, respectively .

In many of these tissues the primary cell types expressing ACE2 appear to be vascular endothelial cells [Donoghue et al., 2000] , and therefore ACE2 has been assumed to be primarily an endothelial protein, much like ACE. In the human lung immunostaining has localized ACE2 to endothelial and smooth muscle cells of large and small blood vessels, as well as to types I and II alveolar epithelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells Ren et al., 2006] . In human bronchial epithelium in vivo ACE2 appears to reside in the apical plasma membrane [Ren et al., 2006] , and it has been reported that ACE2 is apically distributed in ciliated cells of cultured human airway epithelium [Jia et al., 2005] . In the mouse lung Gembardt et al. [2005] have suggested that ACE2 protein is localized to alveolar macrophages and type II cells based on immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization of the mouse lung shows that ACE2 mRNA is localized to vascular endothelial and airway epithelial cells . It is not definitively known based on these studies which particular cell types express ACE2. ACE2 has clearly been demonstrated to act as the primary receptor for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [Li et al., 2003] , the virus responsible for 8,096 cases in 29 countries during the SARS outbreak [World Health Organization, 2004 . Therefore, one can infer the sites of ACE2 expression in the lung from studies localizing SARS coronavirus particles in infected animals. In mouse models of SARS coronavirus infection, in situ hybridization reveals viral RNA in the terminal bronchiolar epithelium [Glass et al., 2004] . In macaque models of SARS coronavirus infection, immunostaining shows extensive SARS coronavirus antigen in types I and II alveolar epithelial cells [Haagmans et al., 2004] . To date there have not been immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization studies that unequivocally identify which cell types express ACE2 in the mouse lung.",

Based on the recent identification in human ACE2 of exon 1a, 5 0 to the 18 known exons [Itoyama et al., 2005] , we performed a BLAST search (NCBI website; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2. cgi) that identified a region of 74% identity between human exon 1a (AB193260) and sequence in the mouse genome 5 0 to the known ACE2 transcript (BC026801). A homologous forward primer (5 0 -TACACTCTGGGAATGAG-GAC-3 0 ) and a reverse primer (5 0 -TCTCAT-CAGCCTTTGAACTT-3 0 ) producing a 219 bp amplicon at the 5 0 end of the previously described exon 1 were designed for RT-PCR using Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 mg) from adult mouse lung was reverse transcribed using a modified oligo (dT) primer and the BD PowerScript Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) as described by the manufacturer, to add several dC residues to the first-strand cDNA 3 0 end. PCR for 5 0 -RACE was then performed with Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech), a universal forward primer, and an ACE2-specific reverse primer (5 0 -GCCTTTGAACTTGGGTTGGGCACTG-3 0 ) using a touchdown PCR protocol [(948C 30 s, 728C 3 min) \u00c2 5 cycles, (948C 30 s, 708C 30 s, 728C 3 min) \u00c2 5 cycles, (948C 30 s, 688C 30 s, 728C 3 min) \u00c2 35 cycles].

Clones were sent for sequencing. After obtaining sequence of exon 1a, a second 5 0 -RACE was performed using an ACE2 specific reverse primer (5 0 -GAAGTTCAGCAGCTGGC-TCCGTGTC-3 0 ) within the new exon to ensure there was no further 5 0 sequence of ACE2.",

By RT-PCR using a forward primer in the 5 0 region of homology to human exon 1a and a reverse primer in the 5 0 end of exon 1, we amplified a 219 bp product in adult mouse lung (Fig. 1B) . Using genomic DNA as a template with the same primers produced a $1,200 bp product (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that the intron between the putative exon 1a and exon 1 is approximately 1-1.5 kb. With 5 0 -RACE ( Fig. 1C) we confirmed the presence of a 188-bp exon 1a of murine ACE2 that shares 74% nucleotide identity with human ACE2 (sequence and homology to human ACE2 exon 1a shown in Fig. 1D ). By sequence analysis this exon is located on chromosome X from position 159,483,486 to 159,483,673 and does not appear to be a coding sequence. The various ACE2 transcripts we have identified both with and without exon 1a are shown in a schematic ( Fig. 2A) and confirmed by RT-PCR in adult lung (Fig. 2B) . Because of the RT-PCR primers used (illustrated in Fig. 2A) , transcripts 1 and 3 may not be full-length transcripts but rather incomplete fragments of the longer transcripts 2 and 4, respectively, lacking the 3 0 untranslated region ( Fig. 2A,B) . However, the presence of the polyA tail in the 3 0 end of the 2.7 kb transcript 3 (BC026801) does suggest a complete mRNA transcript. Nonetheless, only transcripts 2 and 4 ( Fig. 2A,B) have been submitted as novel mRNAs of ACE2 to the NIH GenBank for registration. By reprobing our initial Northern blot with a probe specific for exon 1a, we confirmed that exon 1a is present in both the 2.8 and 3.4 kb transcripts identified in the mouse lung and kidney (data not shown). By RT-PCR the 3.4 kb transcript containing exon 1a (transcript 2 from Fig. 2A) is present in all tissues tested including adult kidney, heart (in low levels), testis, and lung, embryonic day (E) 18.5 lung, and the Clara cell line mtCC (Fig. 2C) .",

            "text": "Western blot analysis confirms the presence of ACE2 protein in adult mouse lung, kidney, heart, and testis, as well as in all cell lines tested (Fig. 3A) . The published literature describes five different molecular weights for human ACE2, based on glycosylation and cleavage [ Lambert et al., 2005] . In the mouse lung, 125 kDa and 75 kDa [Gembardt et al., 2005] species of ACE2 have been reported, and an 89 kDa [Ye et al., 2004; Wysocki et al., 2006] form of ACE2 has been reported in the mouse kidney. By Western blot analyses using an antibody to the membranebound C-terminus of ACE2 (Fig. 3A) or an antibody against the N-terminal ectodomain of ACE2 (Fig. 3B) , we have identified all of the previously described protein species of ACE2. The major protein species in the lung appears to be 75-80 kDa, although the 120 kDa form is also present at lower levels. In contrast, the major species in other tissues tested is the 105-120 kDa isoform, although the kidney also expresses the 80 kDa form. The mtCC Clara cell line appears to express three protein species, 80, 85, and 120 kDa. The other pulmonary and proximal tubule cell lines appear to contain primarily the 80 kDa (MLE-15, BUMPT-7) or 85 kDa (E10, MFLM-4) forms of ACE2. Western analysis with either antibody reveals a strongly immunoreactive species at 180 kDa (Fig. 3A,B) . In order to provide evidence that the immunoreactivity of these bands is specific for ACE2, we used a third antibody against an internal ACE2 peptide for which the antigenic peptide is available (Fig. 3C-E) . Preincubation of the antibody with an excess of peptide blocked binding to the 75-80 kDa protein species observed in the E10 cells, adult lung, and adult kidney, as well as to the 180 kDa species in the E10 cell line. This lends considerable support to the interpretation that all of the observed bands represent ACE2.",

Antibody staining shows that ACE2 protein is preferentially localized in the apical plasma membrane of Clara cells (Fig. 5C,D) but is more diffusely distributed with an intracellular pattern in type II cells (Fig. 5F-H) . This raises the possibility that the two cells may express different transcripts or different pro-tein isoforms. Alveolar macrophages stain positive for ACE2 in some sections, as has been reported previously Ren et al., 2006 ], but our competitive inhibition studies with ACE2 control peptide reveal this staining to be non-specific (data not shown). On E18.5 ACE2 is present in the non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelium but was not detected in the distal lung or vasculature (Fig. 5J-K) by our methods. Given that there has been definitive localization of ACE2 in the kidney and heart reported previously [Donoghue et al., 2000; Lely et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2004; Gembardt et al., 2005; Warner et al., 2005; Wysocki et al., 2006] , we also localized ACE2 in the adult mouse kidney ( Fig. 5L -P) and heart (Fig. 5Q ) as a validation of our immunohistochemical methods and antibodies. ACE2 localization in the mouse kidney is similar to that previously reported for the human Warner et al., 2005] and mouse [Ye et al., 2004; Gembardt et al., 2005] with specific staining in the proximal tubular epithelium brush border (Fig. 5N-O) and in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of small to medium vessels (Fig. 5P) . There was no staining in the renal medulla and very weak staining in glomeruli (Fig. 5L-M) . In the mouse heart the myocardial capillaries show strong staining for ACE2 (Fig. 5Q) , as has been previously reported in the human [Donoghue et al., 2000] .",

We also demonstrate that there are multiple protein isoforms of ACE2, and that the major isoform in the lung differs from those in the other tissues we analyzed. We show through immunostaining that ACE2 in the lung is primarily epithelial, as opposed to endothelial in other tissues, and is specifically localized to Clara cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells. The finding of high levels of both ACE2 mRNA and protein in the Clara cell line mtCC supports our conclusion that Clara cells are a key source of ACE2 in the intact mouse lung. While message levels of ACE2 were low by QRT-PCR in the other cell lines studied, including the types I and II cell lines, the pulmonary endothelial cell line, and the proximal tubule cell line, Western blot analyses demonstrate the presence of ACE2 protein in these cell lines. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 is developmentally regulated in the embryonic mouse lung with an expression pattern that matches those of other Clara cell and peripheral lung epithelial genes with a large increase in message levels between E17.5 and E18.5.",

The size discrepancy between the larger of these transcripts and the published ACE2 mRNAs in the GenBank (AB053182, 1,993 bp; AB053181, 2,760 bp; 2,739 bp, BC026801; and 3,268 bp, NM_027286) led us to seek additional 5 0 sequence here identified as exon 1a of murine ACE2. We initially speculated that the 3.4 kb transcript containing exon 1a might code for the previously undescribed 180 kDa protein isoform that we identified in lung, kidney, and E10 cells using multiple different antibodies to ACE2. However, sequence analysis shows exon 1a to be non-coding, and its 188 bp sequence is likely too short to explain the larger molecular weight if it were translated. The largest molecular weight reported for ACE2 based on the amino acid sequence when fully glycosylated is 125 kDa . The 180 kDa protein species is similar in molecular weight to ACE, which has a molecular weight in the mouse of 170 kDa [Ye et al., 2004; Wysocki et al., 2006] , raising the possibility that ACE2 antibodies might not discriminate between these two proteins. However, we do not believe that this is the case because the manufacturer indicates that the Abcam anti-ACE2 we used does not cross-react with ACE. Furthermore we performed peptide inhibition studies using a different antibody (Santa Cruz) that show the 180 kDa isoform to be specific for ACE2. We do not yet know what accounts for this larger molecular weight. One possibility is that the ACE2 protein is tightly bound to another protein(s) from which it is not dissociated in the Western conditions we used, a possibility supported by previous information on ACE2 [Lin et al., 2004] . Lin et al. [2004] have shown that human ACE2 from failing myocardium co-precipitates with integrin b1 and that this complex migrates at a molecular weight of 130 kDa, suggesting that one of the lower molecular weight ACE2 isoforms is part of the complex. Further studies of murine lung ACE2 will be required to resolve this issue. The other ACE2 isoforms we found in mouse lung (75-80, 85, 105, 120 kDa) are likely due to glycosylation and cleavage events, as has been previously described for human ACE2 .",

We found low mRNA levels in the E10, MLE-15, MFLM-4, and BUMPT-7 cell lines and higher levels in the mtCC cell line. When ACE2 proteins in these cells were examined, we observed an apparent discrepancy: mRNA levels were very low but proteins were easily detected. This relationship has been observed previously for murine ACE2 by Gembardt et al. [2005] , who found low levels of ACE2 mRNA in the mouse heart by RNase protection assay but very strong protein expression in this organ by Western blot. This suggests that the ACE2 message may be very stable but not abundant in some murine cell types, with low levels of mRNA being translated into moderate amounts of protein. Alternatively, the ACE2 protein may be relatively resistant to degradation and thereby accumulate in higher amounts than the lower message level would ordinarily predict.",

One possible explanation is that the smaller isoform represents the epithelial variant of ACE2 that predominates in the lung, while the 120 kDa form represents the endothe-lial variant of ACE2 that predominates in most other tissues. This would be consistent with the finding that the lung, which has endothelial ACE2 expression in some but not all vessels, also contains lesser amounts of the 120 kDa isoform, while the kidney, which expresses ACE2 in the proximal tubule epithelium and in the endothelium of the blood vessels, contains both the 120 kDa and the 80 kDa isoforms. The mtCC Clara cell line expresses three protein isoforms of ACE2, which does not necessarily fit with this model. Insight into possible differential expression of mRNA and protein isoforms in epithelial and endothelial cells will require a number of approaches including in situ hybridization and analysis of primary cells isolated from the lung.",

This transcription factor is exclusively expressed in epithelial cells [Coffinier et al., 1999] . In the lung Coffinier et al. [1999] have shown HNF1b to localize by immunostaining most strongly to the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium with weaker staining in the alveolar epithelium in both E16 and adult mouse lung. In situ hybridization of lungs of mice infected with SARS coronavirus, which binds to ACE2, show viral RNA in the distal bronchiolar epithelium [Glass et al., 2004] . Moreover, the few immunohistochemical [Gembardt et al., 2005] and in situ hybridization studies of the mouse lung suggest that ACE2 is present in alveolar [Gembardt et al., 2005] and airway epithelium, although the specific cell types expressing ACE2 are not clear based on these studies. With the methods we used ACE2 protein is detected in an apical distribution in Clara cells but not ciliated cells of the bronchiolar epithelium, in type II but not type I alveolar epithelial cells, and in the endothelium and smooth muscle of some but not all small to medium blood vessels in the adult mouse lung. In the fetal lung ACE2 mRNA expression peaks at E18.5 and ACE2 is detectable in the distal, non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells. This developmental increase in ACE2 expression correlates well with the known time course of fetal Clara cell differentiation, as determined by marked increase in CC10 expression, which occurs between E15.5 and E18.5 [Keijzer et al., 2001] .",

The ACE2 knock-out mouse has not been reported to have any lung pathology in either fetuses or adults, although the detailed reports on the phenotype of the unstressed ACE2 knock-out mouse focused specifically on the heart [Crackower et al., 2002] and kidney [Oudit et al., 2006] . This suggests that there may be redundant proteins with overlapping functions to ACE2 in normal lung biology. Although ACE2 is known to cleave substrates other than angiotensin II [Vickers et al., 2002] , its function in degrading angiotensin II is presumed to be the most significant [Vickers et al., 2002] and is the best studied. In this role ACE2 acts as a counterbalance to ACE in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. The presence of ACE2 in the pulmonary epithelium is likely to relate to this role as a critical component of the renin-angiotensin system.",

The relevance of these observations to normal lung biology is unclear because many of these studies have used angiotensin II concentrations that far exceed those found in the normal mouse lung [Wei et al., 2002] . While apoptotic cells have been demonstrated by TUNEL staining in the healthy rat lung during post-natal development [Schittny et al., 1998 ], the overall importance of apoptosis in the normal lung remains uncertain. By contrast, strong evidence supports the role of apoptosis in the injured lung, in which the hyperplastic type II cells commonly observed during alveolar epithelial repair are removed by programmed cell death [Bardales et al., 1996] . Whether angiotensin II is a critical mediator of apoptosis in these settings is not known, but studies have shown that autocrine generation of angiotensin II is required for both Fas-induced [Wang et al., 1999a] and TNF-ainduced apoptosis [Wang et al., 2000] in primary cultures of type II cells. Using the ACE2 knock-out mouse as a model, Imai et al. [2005] and Kuba et al. [2005] have clearly demonstrated that ACE2 is able to protect against acute lung injury by catalyzing angiotensin II.",
