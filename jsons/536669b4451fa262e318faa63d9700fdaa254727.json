Although morbidity is low in most of the subjects, the complications of URI, including otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an enormous health impact. Despite the major health care consequences associated with these complications, our understanding of how URI trigger upper airway symptoms and cause exacerbations of lower airway diseases remains limited. This article reviews our current understanding of the pathogenesis of URI, and of viral exacerbations of asthma and COPD, and considers host defense parameters that may regulate susceptibility to disease exacerbations. We will also consider current and potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of URI and their lower airway complications. r",

Consistent with this virally induced pattern, many acute asthma exacerbations seen in the clinical setting are characterized by increased levels of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the airways [26] [27] [28] . Asthmatics who display this neutrophilic profile show a poor response to inhaled corticosteroids [29] . Similarly, while stable COPD is associated with a characteristic infiltration of the bronchial mucosa with CD8 + T lymphocytes and macrophages, severe exacerbations of COPD are associated with increased neutrophilic and lymphocytic influx [30, 31] .

Indeed, the epithelial cell is the only cell type in which HRV has been detected, thus far, by in situ hybridization [32, 33] , during in vivo infections. Moreover, there is now strong evidence that, upon experimental nasal inoculation with HRV, virus spreads to infect epithelial cells in the lower airways [34, 35] , suggesting that epithelial infection may also directly initiate lower airway inflammatory responses. In contrast to viruses such as influenza and RSV, HRV infections do not cause overt epithelial toxicity [36, 37] . Thus, while the cytotoxic effects of influenza and RSV may contribute to the severity of symptoms, it seems reasonable to assume that alterations of epithelial biology represent a common pathway of symptom development by multiple virus types. In support of this concept, infection of epithelial cells by HRV has been shown to generate a wide variety of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, including IL-8 (CXCL8), ENA-78 (CXCL5), IP-10 (CXCL10), RANTES (CCL5), IL-1, IL-6 and IL-11 [23, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Given that several of these products also are detected in airway secretions during HRV infections in vivo [23, 38, [42] [43] [44] , it is likely that they contribute to recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells during infections. The ability to induce proinflammatory cytokine production from epithelial cells is also shared by other viruses. For example, influenza infection induces epithelial production of IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES [45] , while RSV infections induce expression of a wide range of chemokine genes [46] .",

Despite this, a relatively selective cellular profile is seen during infections in vivo. It is unclear what other parameters regulate this limited pattern of inflammatory cell recruitment. It also must be acknowledged that our understanding of the mechanisms by which virally induced chemokine production occurs remains limited. In the case of HRV infections, some chemokines are induced quickly after viral exposure and do not seem to require viral replication [41, 47] , while other genes are not induced until several hours post-infection and are absolutely dependent upon replicating virus [23, 39] . Although both ARTICLE IN PRESS phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase pathways have been implicated in viral induction of chemokines [47] [48] [49] , the early signaling events induced by virus remain poorly elucidated. Similarly, while the viral replication intermediate, double-stranded RNA, and the rhinovirus 3C protease both have been implicated as mediators of late, replication dependent events [23, 50, 51] , the pathways by which such products induce responses are not well defined. Moreover, while it is clear that viral induction of some cytokines and chemokines occurs via transcriptional pathways involving NF-kB and/ or interferon regulatory factor [23, 52] , our understanding of the control of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of epithelial cytokine and chemokine production in response to viral infection also is limited and requires further study. Delineating those aspects of signaling that may be unique for viral induction of chemokines may provide a rational basis for targeted interventions, while studies with selective chemokine or chemokine receptor antagonists will be required to provide a definitive answer on which are the key epithelial mediators involved in disease pathogenesis.",

Of the mediators assessed thus far, some are relatively virus-specific, while others are observed with colds induced by multiple viral types. For example, while RSV infections have been reported to be associated with the generation of virus-specific IgE and increased release of histamine into nasal secretions [53] , levels of histamine are not increased in airway secretions during HRV infections [22] . Moreover, while older antihistamines that display anticholinergic and sedative properties do reduce rhinorrhea during colds, second generation antihistamines lacking these side effects are ineffective [54] . By contrast, other mediators, such as kinins and leukotrienes have been associated with infections due to more than one type of common respiratory virus [22, [55] [56] [57] .

Such factors include pre-existing immunity to a particular viral strain and, in the case of lower airways, the degree of disease control at the time of infection. Another important factor is likely to be the variability of the individual host immune and antiviral response to infection. Although both innate and specific immunity contribute to the host response to infection, it appears as though the innate response is dominant early after infection and is more likely to help regulate the symptomatic response. For example, while HRV infections elicit antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, these are usually not detectable until after disease symptoms have resolved [58] .",

As noted above, infected cells release several cytokines and chemokines that can recruit, and activate, cells of the immune system to the airways. In addition, epithelial production of nitric oxide (NO) appears to play an important role in host antiviral responses [59] . Infection of cultured epithelial cells with any of several common respiratory viruses leads to marked upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased generation of NO. A similar response occurs during experimental HRV infections in vivo, in that levels of epithelial iNOS induction correlate with levels of exhaled NO. Interestingly, in this study, subjects with the highest levels of exhaled NO cleared virus more rapidly and had lower symptoms [60] . A rationale for this is provided by several studies showing that NO exerts direct antiviral activity against several common respiratory viruses, in part by nitroslyating key thiol residues in viral proteases. Moreover, it has been shown that NO also inhibits virally induced generation of several cytokines and chemokines from epithelial cells [59] .",

Similarly oral adrenergic drugs have modest benefit in terms of reducing nasal blockage, while topical agents have a greater efficacy but suffer from issues of rebound [54] . A somewhat greater reduction in total symptoms was observed in experimental HRV infections when a combination of IFN-a2b, together with the first generation antihistamine, chlorpheniramine, and ibuprofen was administered beginning 24 h after viral challenge [64] . Although this represents an important proof of concept regarding the effectiveness of combining an antiviral compound with conventional compounds for symptomatic relief, the practical utility of this combination is limited by cost factors.",

Although the rationale for the use of zinc in the treatment of colds is not well established, multiple studies have evaluated the effectiveness of various zinc salts in this regard. Overall, the results of these studies have been inconclusive. A recent, wellcontrolled trial, however, found that zinc salts had an extremely modest effect in reducing symptoms of experimental HRV infections and was ineffective in natural colds [65] . Similarly, echinacea and ginseng have been widely reported as herbal remedies for colds. Most of the trials to evaluate such agents have been small and have generated conflicting data. Recent randomized trials with relatively large number of subjects reported modest efficacy of a ginseng extract in reducing the frequency of natural colds [66] , but found no significant effect of an extract of echinacea in experimental HRV infections [67] . A major issue in regard to trials of herbal remedies, of course, is that there is no standardization of extracts used across studies. Indeed, given that the identity of any proposed ''active'' ingredient is unknown, it is impossible to know what to standardize.",

Given the data reported, however, it seems unlikely that they will provide any major benefit. Indeed, an interesting question is whether drugs that are currently used for the treatment of asthma and COPD have any beneficial effects during viral exacerbations. There is no doubt that the use of corticosteroids, long acting b-agonists, or leukotriene receptor antagonists, alone or in combination, to maintain optimal asthma control has proven efficacious in reducing number of asthma exacerbations, and the use of oral corticosteroids early in exacerbations helps prevent relapses. Effects on basal inflammation, however, may not necessarily translate to effects on viral-specific inflammation, and there have been no defined studies of the effects of these medications during asthma or COPD exacerbations of known viral origin. Corticosteroids have little efficacy in HRV-induced colds [68] , and it is of interest that asthmatics who display prominent sputum neutrophilia, perhaps indicative of viral etiology, are poorly responsive to inhaled corticosteroids [29] . Because of these limitations, alternative therapeutic approaches to virally induced airway disease continue to be sought.",

            "text": "An obvious strategy is to use antiviral approaches. Influenza vaccine is clearly effective in reducing upper airway symptoms, and in preventing lower disease exacerbations, induced by this virus during the winter months. Unfortunately, vaccination approaches are not feasible for HRV, given the large number of viral serotypes, and have, thus far, proven unsuccessful in the case of RSV infections. Neutralizing antibody prophylaxis has proven effective in preventing RSV-induced bronchiolitis but cost factors limit a broader utility and, again, major feasibility issues would arise with using this approach for HRV. Selective antiviral approaches have shown more promise. In the case of influenza, neuraminidase inhibitors have been available for several years and have proven clinical efficacy in reducing development and severity of symptoms. At least two approaches also have been used to develop potential antiviral agents against HRV. The novel capsid-binding inhibitor, pleconaril, prevents viral uncoating. In natural colds, oral pleconaril (400 mg) administered three times daily led to a significant, but modest reduction in symptoms and also shortened the reported duration of colds [69] . Concerns regarding effects on cytochrome P450 3A4, however, precluded further development as an oral treatment. The alternative antiviral approach used for HRV infections has targeted inhibition of the viral 3C protease, which is necessary for cleavage of the viral polyprotein and, thus, replication. Topical administration of one 3C inhibitor, ruprintrivir, significantly inhibited symptoms in experimental HRV infections even when administered beginning 24 h after infection, although multiple daily dosing was required [70] . Neither of these drugs has been evaluated for their ability to limit HRVinduced exacerbations of lower airway diseases.",
