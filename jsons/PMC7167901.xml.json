This BCS correlates with other variables involved with severity such as the length of stay, need for supplementary oxygen, and need for PICU admission and respiratory support. In the univariate logistic regression analysis, HRV was the only virus found to be a risk factor for severe BCS in acute bronchiolitis. This finding is in accordance with the report of Papadopoulos et al.,13 in which the presence of HRV in infants with bronchiolitis was found to increase by 5.6\u2010fold the risk for severe disease (defined by a clinical score at admission above the 50th percentile). Other reports have also described HRV as an important pathogen in the lower respiratory tract, implicated in severe respiratory distress in children with underlying chronic conditions26 and significantly associated with an increase in the rate of hospitalizations, especially in patients with a history of wheezing or asthma.27\n",

With our results an interesting conclusion can be drawn, which is that, beside the implicated virus, the classical risk factors for HRSV bronchiolitis can be extended to include bronchiolitis caused by other viruses. This observation is important in planning protocols for bronchiolitis management; although palivizumab prophylaxis is administered to high\u2010risk patients for severe HRSV bronchiolitis, most of them continue to be at risk for severe bronchiolitis from other viruses. Efforts to educate caretakers on how to prevent viral infections in high\u2010risk patients should continue, especially where moderate preterms, infants with BPD and CHD are concerned. Additionally, HRV should be taken into account. In our area, where universal HRSV prophylaxis for high\u2010risk patients HRV is associated with severe cases when clinical factors are not considered, routine screening for HRV at admission may be proposed in order to identify infants at risk for severe disease and to separate the hospitalized patients into cohorts so as to avoid nosocomial infection.",

Severity of infection by a virus can fluctuate in different seasons, as can the pattern of circulating viruses in the community, which may explain the differences in severity by specific viruses found in this and other reports. Also, the high palivizumab prophylaxis rate in our population probably leads to underestimation of the role of HRSV in high\u2010risk infants. Another limitation is that BCS is not yet a validated instrument for bronchiolitis scoring. Nevertheless, none of the available scoring systems for bronchiolitis has been validated neither has all tests characteristics studied (reliability, responsiveness, reproducibility). BCS is implemented in the daily clinical practice in our institution for 15 years and shows good correlation with other outcomes of severity (length of hospital stay, days of oxygen therapy and of naso\u2010gastric feeding tub, FiO2, greater PICU admission and need for respiratory support). The use of different bronchiolitis scoring systems is a common limitation of most articles in this field because it difficults to compare with other studies.",
