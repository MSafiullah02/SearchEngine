Especially important are a variety of nonenveloped human and animal enteric pathogenic viruses that can enter the environment through the discharge of waste materials from infected individuals; contaminate food products and drinking and recreational waters; and be transmitted back to susceptible individuals to continue the cycle of infection (Table 6 .1).

The origin of the outbreak, which was attributed to hepatitis A at the time but now confirmed to be hepatitis E, was the contamination by sewage, from 1 to 6 weeks prior to the epidemic, of the Jumna River, the source of water for the treatment plant. Alum and chlorine treatment prevented bacterial infections, but 30,000 cases of hepatitis occurred among the population. As a consequence of this outbreak, studies in water and environmental virology began with efforts to detect poliovirus in water around 50 years ago. Since that time, other enteric viruses responsible for gastroenteritis and hepatitis have replaced enteroviruses as the main target for detection in the environment, although the near eradication of poliomyelitis from the globe calls for exhaustive studies on the occurrence of wild-type and vaccinal-type polioviruses in environmental samples. Viruses are shed in extremely high numbers in the feces of infected individuals; patients suffering from diarrhea or hepatitis may excrete from 10 5 to 10 11 virus particles per gram of stool (Farthing, 1989) . Furthermore, a single episode of vomit of a patient with norovirus gastroenteritis may contain around 10 7 particles (Cheesbrough et al., 1997) . Ingestion of sewagecontaminated water or food is the main route of infection with human enteric viruses, although the role of inanimate surfaces serving as vehicles for virus infection must not be underestimated. Viruses with a viremic phase, such as the hepatitis viruses, may also be parenterally transmitted, although these days it is considered to be a much less frequent mode of transmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1214, "end": 1230, "text": "(Farthing, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1376, "text": "(Cheesbrough et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A poorly understood aspect in the epidemiology of several enteric viruses is the role of animal viruses in human disease.

Details on virus concentration procedures have been published elsewhere (American Public Health Association, 1998; Environmental Protection Agency, 1984) . All available concentration methodologies have important limitations, and their virus concentration efficiency depends, in part, on the quality of the sampled water. Basically, all available procedures have been evaluated using samples spiked with known viruses. It is known that the recovery efficiency recorded with experimentally contaminated water dramatically decrease when the method is applied in actual field trials. Additionally, none of the existing concentration procedures has been tested with all of the medically important virus groups; normally, a few specific enteric viruses have been employed to conduct the evaluation trials. However, several virus concentration methods have been used successfully to recover naturally occurring enteric viruses in water (Finance et al., 1982; Gerba and Goyal, 1982; and Gerba, 1983; Environmental Protection Agency, 1984; Lewis and Metcalf, 1988; Henshilwood et al., 1998) . Most of the procedures for concentrating and extracting viruses make use of the properties of the viral proteinaceous macromolecules. Certain protein structures confer on viruses in an aquatic environment the properties of a hydrophilic colloid of an amphoteric nature whose electric charge varies according to the pH and the ionic force of the environment. Viruses can therefore be adsorbed onto and then detach themselves from different substrates that are positively or negatively charged depending on their pH.

The incident involved green onions imported from Mexico and added to the restaurant's homemade salsa. Those green onions were stored in a single container for up to 5 days in the ice used for shipping them. Some of the uncooked green onions were used in the restaurant's mild salsa that was prepared in large batches and stored for up to 3 days. If the shipment ice was contaminated, prolonged exposure combined with the relatively long storage of salsa may account for why so many patrons became infected. Green onions, which are multilayered and can retain soil particles that could harbor fecal contaminants, were probably contaminated during harvesting and packing.

As mentioned earlier and discussed elsewhere in this book, bacteriophages and other microorganisms of fecal flora have been proposed as models of virus behavior. However, from the strictly structural point of view, there is no better surrogate of an actual virus pathogen to track their behavior in the environment than a noninfectious virus-like particle (VLP) of the same virus. Recombinant VLPs of health-significant viruses as norovirus and rotavirus have been employed to investigate the influence of electrostatic interactions in the filtration of norovirus in quartz sand and rotavirus behavior under disinfection conditions, respectively (Redman et al., 1997; Caballero et al., 2004) . As model systems, recombinant tracers are perfectly adequate for field studies of microbial tracking, as they may be produced in extremely high numbers (several milligram amounts).
