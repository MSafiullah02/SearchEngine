Although the density and composition of domestic species varies dramatically globally (Fig. 2.2), livestock systems alone now account for more than 30 % of the Earth\u2019s ice-free terrestrial area (Steinfeld et al. 2006). In addition to growing populations, demand for higher volume and higher quality diets has driven these increases, and per capita production has also increased (FAOSTAT 2014). In 2013 there were approximately 3.5 individual poultry and 0.5 common production mammals (cattle, sheep, and pigs) raised, on average, for every one of nearly seven billion people globally (calculated from FAOSTAT 2014). Facilitating this growth, the global capacity to raise both more animals and more animals per unit of land area has increased, marking an increase in efficiency and intensity of food production. The highest densities and efficiencies are achieved with the aid of technological advances that were developed and are primarily used in the developed world (Tilman et al. 2011).\n\n",

The same statistics for many domestic animals likely exceed this. The sheer scale and global reach of food production systems means that they are also major drivers of ecosystem change. In addition to the direct risks posed by high stocking densities and sophisticated transportation and trade networks, it is the associated environmental and demographic factors of animal production systems that present some of the biggest challenges from a disease emergence perspective (McMichael et al. 2007).\n",

Some populations are essentially dependent on wild-harvested food to meet basic nutritional requirements; for example, in some parts of the Congo Basin, protein from bushmeat comprises as much as 94 % of total protein of the household diet (Fa et al. 2003). In Madagascar, restricting access to bushmeat would reportedly result in a significant increase of anemia cases among children, with the poorest households worst-affected (Golden et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Although people have been hunting wild species for food for millennia, there has been a marked increase in the harvest of wild species over the last several decades (Milner-Gulland and Bennett 2003; Ziegler 2010). For example, the development of industrial logging in Republic of Congo has led to a 69 % increase in the population of logging towns and a 64 % increase in bushmeat supply (Poulsen et al. 2009). The emergence of market-based economies and the commercialization of wild-harvest animals in urban centers have further increased demand. The scale of the trade in wild-harvest meat has also changed considerably due to advances in hunting practices, population growth, and increasing accessibility to remote areas (Nyaki et al. 2014). The trade of wild-harvested meat for food can now be viewed as a continuum ranging from subsistence-based rural consumption to commercial hunting for the international trade in wild animal meat and products (e.g., exotic food and traditional medicine), with this leading to dramatic price point differences (Brashares et al. 2011; Chaber et al. 2010). For example, bushmeat traders have reported pricing per kg of wild meat in Paris markets at up to double the price of domestic meat for sale in French supermarkets (Chaber et al. 2010). Similarly, in New York, USA, smoked duiker (an antelope) from Ghana can be readily attained, although at up to 25 times the cost of the same species sold near its source (Brashares et al. 2011). Such \u201curban\u201d demand, which also occurs locally, places a premium on wild species and often permits local hunters to earn incomes comparable to or higher than local wages for other occupations, sustaining commercial hunting on a large scale (Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al. 2013). Market factors thus provide a significant additional incentive for wild harvest beyond the protein needs of an individual hunter or family.",

Even if the prevalence of potentially zoonotic pathogens in the animals traded is low, and viability of microbes much reduced after time in the trade, the sheer volume of bushmeat traded internationally, and lack of traceability through illegal or clandestine trade, suggests a significant public health risk. Measuring or controlling this risk is made more difficult because the global distribution of wild-harvested food is highly variable, poorly reported, and difficult to map (Fig. 2.3).\n\n",

Historically, many human diseases are thought to have arisen as a result of the environmental and demographic changes attributable to the advent of food systems (agriculture and/or animal domestication) (Pearce-Duvet 2006; Wolfe et al. 2007). Such \u201ccivilization diseases\u201d include some likely acquired directly from domesticated species (e.g., measles, pertussis) or indirectly, either because domestic animals provided a more stable route of infection for pathogens to enter human populations from wildlife (e.g., smallpox) or due to the influence of environmental perturbation in elevating the risk of pathogen transmission to humans from wildlife hosts and vectors (e.g., falciparum malaria) (Pearce-Duvet 2006). All of the diseases mentioned above were at one time EIDs, highlighting how some of the emerging diseases of the recent past and present will almost certainly become the diseases of humanity in the future. Understanding the origins and drivers of EIDs is thus of considerable and growing public health interest (Morse et al. 2012).",

The diversity of types of contact that have been relevant historically for the emergence of viral zoonoses from wildlife associated with food systems is summarized in Table 2.1. In wild harvest systems, contact events have typically occurred directly between a person and a range of wildlife species ultimately used for food (HIV, Ebola, SARS, Lassa, Monkeypox), via contact activities such as hunting, handling, butchering, consumption, and trade. In animal production systems, people have become infected most commonly from contact with domestic animals that had first been exposed to wildlife pathogens (e.g., HPAI influenza, Nipah, Menangle), where tending and treating domestic animals for illness resulted in human infection. Japanese Encephalitis represents an example where humans are infected when bitten by mosquito vectors, which acquire and maintain infection after feeding on wild hosts or infected domestic species (e.g., pigs). For diseases more diffusely associated with agricultural activities, infection often occurs via contact with virus present in wildlife excreta (e.g., hantaviruses) or fomites (see Table 2.1 and references therein).\n",

An important challenge in understanding the risks of viral zoonoses due to food systems is identifying the relevant transmission routes that allow for pathogen transmission between wild animal reservoirs, vectors, domestic animals, and humans. Transmission routes can be classified into five broad but distinct categories and used to analyze patterns of disease emergence (Loh et al. 2015). These include direct contact (i.e., skin-to-skin contact; scratches; animal bites; contact with body fluids, organs, and tissues; direct large droplet >5 \u03bcm exposure), airborne (i.e., via dust particles and airborne small droplets <5 \u03bcm), vector-borne (i.e., by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods), oral (i.e., consumption of contaminated food or water; ingestion of arthropods), and contamination (i.e., indirect contact with soil or vegetation, contact with water, indirect transmission by contaminated inanimate objects). Direct contact is the most common transmission pathway cited for diseases associated with food systems, although airborne transmission of virus associated with aerosolized wildlife excreta is also relatively common (Table 2.1). Nevertheless, the range of transmission pathways implicated in the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems is relatively diverse, with each transmission pathway represented at least once.",

These distal or upstream risk factors also include any condition or activity along any transmission pathway that intensifies the contact rate, increases the prevalence or diversity of available pathogens to be transmitted, or elevates the likelihood of successful disease transmission given contact (Murray and Daszak 2013; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009). Distal risk factors could also include other \u201cenabling\u201d factors, such as climate or other environmental factors. The key distal factors that have been associated with the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems are summarized in Table 2.1. Broadly speaking, large-scale ecosystem and environmental change, including deforestation, land-use change and conversion for agriculture, have been commonly implicated in disease emergence within food systems. Examples include the rodent-borne arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Laguna Negra) that are often facilitated by agricultural land conversion, HIV which is thought to have emerged as a result of the changes in forest access and human connectivity attributable to industrial development, and Nipah and Menangle viruses which are thought to have emerged due to increasing niche overlap and contact between reservoirs and domestic animal species (see Table 2.1 and references therein). In addition to human-induced ecosystem changes, there are a range of social and demographic factors that have also played roles as distal risk factors, including the trade of wildlife species within markets with sophisticated transport networks and in which inter-species mixing has occurred (SARS, monkeypox), or increased domestic animal stocking densities (agricultural intensification) to meet growing human food demands while at the same time enhancing conditions for viral amplification (HPAI, Japanese Encephalitis) (see Table 2.1 and references therein).",

Such horizon scanning exercises are critical for anticipating the risks associated with the growth in scale and magnitude of food systems into the future. For example, in industrial food systems, airborne transmission may potentially be an under-recognized pathway as a recent study found a million-fold elevated concentration of aerosolized invisible dust in a poultry barn fan compared to the outside air (Leibler et al. 2009). This could have implications for both human and animal health in addition to the spread of true airborne diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease (FMD), influenza, or Q fever.\n",

Exploitation of wildlife for food will likely be facilitated by increasing land-use change and deforestation activities, whatever their purpose, particularly in more remote regions where these activities make forests more accessible to hunters and create new markets for bushmeat (Poulsen et al. 2009). Climate change is also expected to threaten food security in many regions, again promoting greater reliance on wild harvest species in some regions (Nkem et al. 2010).

The biggest growth will be seen in domestic animal products, with predictions suggesting an increase in annual demand for meat of 6\u201323 kg per person per year worldwide by 2050. The largest increases will be in Latin America, the Caribbean, South East Asia and the Pacific, and demand per person will more than double in sub-Saharan Africa (Thornton and Herrero 2010). Food production is expected to more intensely compete with the acquisition of other products from the environment such as land, water and energy, contributing to loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity, including some related to health (Tilman et al. 2011; McMichael et al. 2007). Deforestation and associated human activities related to domestic animal production, for example, will continue to alter the structure and species composition of ecosystems and increase contact rates between humans, wildlife, vectors and domestic animals, resulting in disease emergence (Murray and Daszak 2013).",

Climate change is expected to influence migration patterns of migratory bird species that are the natural reservoirs for many AI viruses, alter transmission dynamics and affect the survival of virus outside of hosts, all of which have the potential to shift disease risks for this important group of viruses (Gilbert et al. 2008). In addition, the link between domestic duck production, which is expected to grow in scale and extent to build food security in Asia, and the persistence of HPAI H5N1 is often synchronously linked to the production of rice. The strong seasonal component of this system means that climate change has the potential to impact the distribution and persistence of HPAI in other more indirect ways as well (Gilbert et al. 2008).",

While drug-resistant EIDs are more common in non-zoonotic EIDs than zoonotic EIDs (Zambrana-Torrelio et al. 2012), greater use of growth-promoting antimicrobials in animal production and human exposure via food as well as antimicrobials disseminated into the environment from animal production waste may potentially increase human susceptibility to infections (Marshall and Levy 2011).",

The lack of adequate infrastructure for biosecurity measures in low-income nations where bushmeat currently serves as a major form of subsistence nutrition thus presents vulnerability around potential intensified livestock production to shift protein sources.

These improvements have improved human health more broadly by decreasing malnourishment, increasing life expectancy and reducing child mortality (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 2010; Godfray et al. 2010). Health gains will of course continue to be an ongoing human objective, with food security being a central part of the development agenda (FAO 2014). The health benefits of food production, however, need to be weighed against the health and environmental costs, including those associated with ecosystem degradation (McMichael et al. 2007). There have been calls for concerted redistribution of excess food and deployment of food production technologies to areas of the world most in need (Tilman et al. 2011). These strategies might have secondary benefits to global health by reducing food demands in some regions, leading to reduced environmental and total area designated for food production.",

To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) is undergoing an assessment of the global impacts of foodborne illnesses through its Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses. While the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius provides benchmark international trade standards to promote food safety, the guidance is voluntary; the U.S., for example, does not require its producers and suppliers to adhere to its rigorous standards. The lack of a central authority for wildlife health has translated into limited infrastructure for disease surveillance and control around the safety of bushmeat in both source and demand settings. As a result, efforts have largely focused on reactive responses to disease emergence events, rather than prevention of disease risks. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) regulates trade of livestock for priority diseases, which include some potential zoonoses (e.g., HPAI), but does not address wildlife trade/pathogens specifically in its World Trade Organization-enforced sanitary standards. There is no comparable regulation for wildlife diseases, although in the USA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically restricts imports of certain turtles in response to salmonellosis, bats in response to Nipah virus, African rodents in response to monkeypox, civets in response to SARS, and non-human primates (Smith et al. 2012).\n",

Current governance and enforcement structures are therefore unlikely to be fully effective and in many cases unwarranted for reducing local demand (e.g., for local populations living in or on the periphery of forests with few suitable alternatives). In this context, some interventions may be low-resource and high-yield, such as working with hunters and foresters to convey risks of collecting deceased wildlife carcasses and encourage reporting of animal morbidity or mortality that can inform disease surveillance efforts (Rouquet et al. 2005; Olson et al. 2012). These interventions to prevent initial spillover are especially important given the challenges of influencing human behaviors when controlling human outbreaks. For example, the UN recently reported the dismissal of a local chief in Sierra Leone for failing to report secret burials that may have violated regulations intended to contain the spread of Ebola (UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) 19 November 2014). However, it seems inevitable that reducing demand for bushmeat will be fundamentally necessary to safeguard species from overhunting and extinction and to mitigate the disease risks. Reducing demand will be easiest for populations with access to alternative food sources. High demand and pricing for wild-harvest species may influence hunting practices, including expanding volumes and time of year spent hunting, whereas previously hunting pressure has been naturally limited by hunting for subsistence, traditional techniques, seasonality, and cultural taboos on harvesting certain species (Lindsey et al. 2012).",

High taxation levies may sufficiently raise the price to reduce demand and provide revenue for enforcement and surveillance efforts ( see Courchamp et al. 2006). The clandestine nature of the illegal wildlife trade remains a challenge for tracking and enforcement, but high penalties have not yet been enacted in many settings; steeper penalties may provide stronger disincentives to participation in the illegal wildlife trade, such that even if zero volume cannot be realistically achieved, a large reduction in volume will still have large benefits from a risk reduction viewpoint. Additionally, development projects that encroach into wildlife habitat can be managed to ensure they do not fuel demand for bushmeat. Governments can demand responsibility on the part of corporations to provide alternative food sources for employees and set policies to provide deterrents for bushmeat consumption. Governments could require wildlife disease risk analysis processes to be undertaken for proposed development projects to more proactively weigh risks and ensure risk prevention or mitigation measures are conducted. This type of analysis could be included within existing Health Impact Assessment (HIA) structures, because, while some HIAs include risk of zoonotic diseases from domestic animals and other vectors, few adequately address the range of potential zoonotic pathogens in their intended scope.\n",

            "text": "The farming of wildlife for food may reduce pressures on wild populations, and is increasingly becoming a way to sustain demand in the face of increasing prices of wild-caught individuals. For example, porcupines, snakes, frogs, tigers, and a range of other wildlife species are farmed in Southern China for food and medicine (Abbott and van Kooten 2011). While this has been debated widely as a tool for conservation (e.g., the farming of tigers to reduce poaching), it has not been proposed as a strategy to reduce the public health risks of the wildlife trade. We propose that the farming of wildlife species could reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover if similar health and biosecurity measures are applied to farmed wildlife as to livestock. In this scenario, specific known zoonoses are tested for, treated or infected animals removed from a farm\u2019s founder wild-caught stock, resulting in reduced risk of zoonotic pathogen \u201cspillover\u201d to ranchers, traders, or butchers. Biosecurity measures will be critical to reducing risk because the intensive production of species that potentially carry novel zoonotic agents could result in increased pandemic risk. For example, civets have long been farmed in some parts of Africa (Eniang and Daniel 2007; Tolosa and Regassa 2007), and prior to the SARS outbreak in China in 2002, civets were farmed increasingly in China. While the role of civets in the emergence of SARS is not fully understood, it is thought that they may have acted as amplifier hosts, expanding transmission and evolution of a bat-origin SARS-like coronavirus (Wang and Eaton 2007).",

For example, regions with tsetse fly infestations affect cattle production through high morbidity and mortality burden from trypanosomiasis; while wildlife appear to carry infection, they are not highly susceptible to it (Steverding 2008). In theory, wildlife ranching may provide a contained environment where disease may be controlled through adoption of effective biosecurity measures. For example, Zambia\u2019s wildlife ranching is subject to inspection of animals or meat by veterinarians prior to sale (Lindsey et al. 2013). However, the sensitivity of this approach in detecting disease risks is not known; visual inspections by veterinarians may not recognize all illness in animals, especially asymptomatic infections that wildlife may be carrying, and viral pathogens are often not evident in meat without laboratory screening. Challenges around traceability in the market chain also introduce risk if free-ranging and ranched animals cannot be distinguished.",

For example, many countries conduct wild bird surveillance for avian influenza, but screening is typically limited to only a subset of HA and NA subtypes, limiting knowledge of viral diversity circulating in populations (Hoye et al. 2010). Targeted surveillance for broader indicators of viral diversity (e.g., whole genome sequencing or at least typing for all 8 AI gene segments) can provide baseline monitoring to capture changes, including risk potential, over time. Coordinated global research priorities, such as set forward by the OIE-FAO OFFLU global network of expertise on influenza (http://www.offlu.net/), can provide an international platform for systematic surveillance approaches and data aggregation and identify high-priority investment areas to maximize surveillance resources.",

Aiming for 100 % detection would be more expensive ($6.8 billion) due to diminishing returns on viral discovery, but even this figure is less than the cost of some major single outbreaks (e.g., SARS) (Anthony et al. 2013), and far less than the total costs of emerging zoonotic diseases over the past two decades, estimated to be in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars (The World Bank June 2012; Karesh et al. 2012a). Globally coordinated, mitigative responses that reduce the risks and frequency of diseases emerging in the first place and are implemented now are forecast to save approximately US$3.5 billion per year over a 100-year time horizon in comparison to a business-as-usual approach to EID response (Pike et al. 2014).",
