The notion that patients with known or suspected COVID-19 with respiratory failure should be intubated and ventilated early in the disease course without the option for less invasive treatments, including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV), has been suggested. However, WHO guidelines for the management of respiratory failure in COVID-19 advocate the use of CPAP or NIV, provided that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn.1\n",

Additionally, unnecessary intubation and ventilation of one patient might deny what might be life-saving treatment for another patient in resource-limited settings. Resorting to less invasive respiratory support when the capacity for mechanical ventilation has been reached could also raise anxiety among many staff, who might believe that they are being exposed to a high-risk procedure due to a scarcity of health-care resources.",
