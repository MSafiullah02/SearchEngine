The value we place on privacy and on health are often in tension. The key question of this chapter is this: How much are we willing to share about our personal health to better the collective health of our communities? 1 This chapter is presented in three parts. The first is largely descriptive, giving an overview of the historical and contemporary role of surveillance in public health and legal responsibility for public health. The second part takes a more normative turn, briefly exploring the competing values of privacy and public health. The third section provides ethical justification for public health surveillance without consent, including suggested policies and safeguards necessary to protect both privacy and public health.",

Recognizable elements of public health surveillance were seen first in the United States in 1741 when the colony of Rhode Island required reports to health officials from tavern keepers about persons with \"contagious diseases,\" as indicated by coughing, sneezing, and fever (Thacker 2010) . Tavern keepers were required to report instead of health care providers, as persons were more often seen by the former than the latter. By 1874 Massachusetts became the first state to enact voluntary weekly reporting of infectious conditions using postcards (Bowditch et al. 1915 ) -a method that was used by states for over 100 years, replaced by telephone reporting in the late 1980s and digital reporting in the 2000s. It was after two severe epidemics in the early twentieth century -poliomyelitis and influenza -that all states began participating in national morbidity reporting (National Office of Vital Statistics 1953) . Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data with the a priori purpose of preventing or controlling disease or injury, or identifying unusual events of public health importance, followed by the dissemination and use of information for public health action (Lee and Thacker 2011) .",

As of August 2011, CSTE recommended that states require 8 conditions be reported as extremely urgent (within 4 h), including anthrax, botulism, plague, paralytic poliomyelitis, SARS-associated coronavirus, smallpox, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. In addition, they recommended 11 urgent conditions to be reported within 24 h and 61 standard conditions to be reported electronically within 7 days (www.cste.org). The list of conditions that are reportable by health care providers to the state health department varies somewhat by state, but a core set of conditions is reported by all jurisdictions. Once collated at the state health department, reports are then deidentified and forwarded to CDC for national-level public health action.",

Instead of waiting until a specific condition is diagnosed, public health officials can combine information from signs and symptoms, exposures to infectious agents or environmental conditions, and health-related behaviors to identify unusual patterns in groups or communities that might indicate an impending concern for which planning and decision making can begin before cases are diagnosed. Depending on how closely related these pre-disease indicators are to the development of an actual case of the condition of concern, there will be some proportion of false-positives (persons with the pre-disease indicator who do not develop the condition).

In recent history, public health professionals identified a number of important and new conditions using syndromic surveillance including Reye's syndrome in 1936 , Legionnaires' disease in 1976 , Lyme disease in 1977 , toxic shock syndrome in 1978 , HIV/AIDS in 1981 , and SARS in 2003 (Goodman et al. 2012 . The definition of public health surveillance and many state statutes specify a requirement to report unusual events of public health importance in addition to the list of conditions a health care provider must report.

States update their list of reportable conditions in different ways, depending on whether it is law, regulation, or rule that determines reportability.

Concerns about technology and privacy are not new. In the late nineteenth century, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis ignited public discussion about how new technologies were invading privacy by disseminating details about the private lives of individuals without their knowledge or permission, which ran counter to the population's expectation of a protected private life. These new technologies -photography and the mass printing and distribution of daily newspapers -led to major changes in how people learned private details about each other's lives (DeCew 2012). In 1890, Warren and Brandeis promoted a \"right to one's own personality\" and asserted that \"the existing law affords a principle from which may be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual from invasion\" (Warren and Brandeis 1890) . Later, as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Brandies declared in his dissent to Olmstead versus United States (1928) that \"the right to be let alone [is] the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men (sic).\"",

            "text": "It is nearly universally, albeit naively, held that John Stuart Mill's \"harm principle\" serves as the normative justification for any state intervention over individual action -and that such intervention is ethically acceptable only when it prevents harm to others. The use of Mill's harm principle to support autonomy as the supreme value stems largely from the field of bioethics and its narrow misinterpretation of Mill's thoughts on liberty (Dawson and Verweij 2008) . Mill indeed stated that, \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\" (Mill 1859, p. 14) . But to stop there is akin to misquoting, as Mill goes on to state: His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him, must be calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. (Mill 1859, p. 14) Persons opposed to public health interventions often claim that Mill's \"harm principle\" (as truncated above) requires us to not be paternalistic in any way. This passage clearly shows that Mill acknowledged that we do have good reasons to \"reason with\" and \"persuade\" people to \"do otherwise,\" which is what public health often does. Furthermore, actions that society can rightfully censure are limited to those that are \"calculated to produce evil to someone else.\" These all clearly are supportive of public health interventions, not in opposition as suggested by the truncated and misleading version of the passage concerning the \"harm principle.\"",

There are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court of justice; to bear his fair share in the common defence, or in any other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the protection; and to perform certain acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a fellow creature's life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is obviously a man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible for not doing. A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury. (Mill 1859, p. 15) Mill was not writing about public health or propriety of the state's prohibition of super-sized portions of fast food. His essay makes it clear from the opening pages that he was deeply concerned with the importance of liberty with respect to the tyranny of the majority. The complexity and nuance of his thoughts on liberty are done a grave disservice by the simplification that occurs when these ideas are reduced to the \"harm principle\" and by the dismissal of the remainder of the essay, which describes the responsibilities we have to each other.",

The policy protections should be predicated on values of interdependence, ethical oversight, and scientific evidence and include guidance such as mandates to \u2022 collect the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve the public health objective, including leaving off personal identifiers when possible, \u2022 engage affected communities when developing data collection and data dissemination plans, especially when data release might add burdens to an already stigmatized group, and \u2022 ensure that public health professionals who have contact with data are active and responsible stewards ultimately accountable for the protection of data and information (Lee and Gostin 2009, p. 83) .",

Agencies should not hold data they will not need or use. Since nothing of use will come from these data, only two outcomes are possible: nothing or a breach. This type of risk cannot be ethically justified.

We posited that public health surveillance would be ethically justified if its practices \"[met] the affirmative and refrain[ed] from violating negative operating principles\" of the existing public health ethics frameworks (Lee et al. 2012, p. 41) . Although based on different theoretical underpinnings, several common operating principles emerged from the 13 public health ethics frameworks we reviewed. The common ethical principles included community, justice, interdependence, duty, human rights, autonomy, imposing minimal interference, ensuring intervention is necessary and effective, providing evidence that benefits outweigh infringement, reducing inequities, transparency, and inclusiveness. We then evaluated the best practices for the seven steps of public health surveillance and concluded that \"a well-designed public health surveillance system that engages affected communities, collects the minimum data necessary, stores data securely, and uses data for public health action (Lee et al. 2012, p. 43 )\" is supported by contemporary public health ethics frameworks even when conducted without explicit patient consent.",

This argument allows for conditions where persons could justify a privacy claim over a public health good, specifically where there are important personal interests the exercise of which would not unreasonably burden the basic health interest.

The role of a government in protecting and enhancing the health of its people, thus meeting a basic interest of its population, is clear when the activities necessary are those that individuals cannot implement themselves.
