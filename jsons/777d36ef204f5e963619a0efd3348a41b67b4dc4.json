To provide a platform for assessing the pattern by which FCoV I attaches to its host receptor(s), HEK293 cell lines that stably express the ectodomains of the spike (S) proteins derived from a FCoV I feline enteric coronavirus strain UU7 (FECV UU7) and a feline infectious peritonitis virus strain UU4 (FIPV UU4) were established. Using the recombinant S proteins as probes to perform S protein affinity histochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues, although no tissue or enteric binding of FECV UU7 S protein was detected, it was found that by immunohistochemistry that the tissue distribution of FIPV UU4 S protein-bound cells correlated with that of FIPV antigenpositive cells and lesions associated with FIP and that the affinity binding of FIPV UU4 S protein on macrophages was not affected by enzymatic removal of host cell-surface sialic acid with neuraminidase. These findings suggest that a factor(s) other than sialic acid contribute(s) to the macrophage tropism of FIPV strain UU4. This approach allowed obtaining more information about both virus-host cell interactions and the biological characteristics of the unidentified cellular receptor for FCoV I.",

In contrast, FIPVs show a tropism for macrophages (17) (18) (19) . Some investigators have suggested that FIPVs and FECVs are independently circulating viruses (20, 21) . However, accumulating evidence has shown that FIPVs arise from genetic mutations of FECVs during in vivo infection (15, (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) , leading to switching of tropism from intestinal enterocytes to motile monocytes/macrophages and causing systemic dissemination of the virus and FIP. FIP, a fatal immunopathologic disease, is characterized by disseminated pyogranulomas and severe inflammatory damage around blood vessels (26, 28) .

To date, the cellular receptor for FCoV I is unknown; hence, it is difficult to propagate the virus in cell culture for further study. To gain information on the cell tropism of this virus and to provide a platform for assessing S-host receptor binding, we constructed HEK293 cell lines that stably express the ectodomain of S proteins derived from the FIPV strain UU4 and the FECV strain UU7. Using recombinant S protein as a probe, we performed S protein histochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissues from cats confirmed to have FIP infection and cats without FIP infection, with or without enzymatic removal of cell-surface sialic acid with NA. Our results show that binding of the FIPV S protein correlates with the cell tropism of the virus and reflects FIP pathogenesis.",

Our failure to observe any effect of S protein binding to macrophages after NA pre-treatment suggests that a factor(s) other than sialic acid is responsible for this tropism of serotype 1 FIPV strain UU4.

After treating S proteins with PNGase F to remove N-glycans, the molecular weights of both expressed FIPV UU4 and FECV UU7 S ectodomains were reduced to about 170 KDa, suggesting that the S protein ectodomains produced in the HEK293 cells are highly glycosylated. Indeed, using N-glycosylation site prediction services available from the Center for Biological Sequences (33), at least 13 and 14 Nglycosylation sites were predicted in the FIPV UU4 S protein and FECV UU7 S protein, respectively. Proteins secreted by mammals often contain obligate posttranslational modifications, including addition of the disulfide bonds and unique glycosylation patterns that are required for proper folding and/or biological activity. We believe that the S protein expressed in the HEK293 system undergoes obligate post-translational modifications to better bind receptors on cell surfaces. Using the recombinant proteins expressed by the HEK293 system performing S affinity histochemistry on tissues from cats, we demonstrated the binding and interaction of FIPV UU4 S protein with tissue macrophages and feline blood PBMCs.

Given that intestinal enzymes cause extremely rapid post-mortem cellular autolysis of the intestine, the failure of S proteins to bind to enterocytes may be attributable to loss of the membrane integrity of enterocytes. Although the S affinity histochemistry approach used in the present study could serve as a good tool for studying virus-host receptor interactions in paraffin-embedded tissues, it has limited use in tissues with poor membrane integrity, such as autolytic tissues or intestines. Hence, the present findings concerning interaction of both viral S proteins with their host receptors in the intestine in paraffin-embedded tissues are inconclusive. Further studies of FECV S affinity histochemistry using feline primary enterocytes or enteric cell lines may reduce the limitations of S affinity histochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues.",

            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrated binding of the S protein of serotype I FIPV UU4 to tissue macrophages and showed by staining the same lesions in serial tissue sections that the distribution of S protein-bound macrophages is related to that of FIPV antigens and lesions associated with FIP. In fact, in our study most tissue macrophages were not recognized by FIPV UU4 S protein. In cats with and without FIP, only some macrophage sublineages bore cellular receptors that were recognized by FIPV UU4 S protein. Indeed, some tissue macrophages are not permissive for FIPV infection, as shown by the failure to detect FIPV antigens in some proliferating macrophage populations, including macrophages in splenic red pulp in cats with FIP infection (37, 38) . Future studies aimed at determining which macrophages sublineages are susceptible to FIPV infection would be interesting. Moreover, individual differences in the sustainability and susceptibility of monocytes to infection between cats has been reported (39) , indicating that host factors likely also affect interactions between host receptors and S protein binding affinity. We identified fewer FIPV UU4 S than FCoV IHC protein-bound macrophages/monocytes by S histochemistry. This decreased binding of S protein in affinity histochemistry most likely resulted from tissue damage during slide preparation or loss of cell integrity in pyogranulomatous lesions associated with FIP.",

            "text": "Using S affinity histochemistry, we have here successfully demonstrated the affinity binding of FIPV UU4 S protein to tissue macrophages but not binding of FECV UU7 S protein to these cells. Because tissue damage during slide preparation or loss of cell integrity may have reduced the detection sensitivity of S affinity histochemistry, in the course of our studies we performed S fluorescent staining and flow cytometry to more sensitively and quantitatively detect S protein binding on PBMCs, FCWF-4 cells and CRFK cells. By using the S fluorescent staining and fluorescent microscopy, we demonstrated that binding of FIPV UU4 S protein to PBMCs occurs in less than 1% of cells (Fig. S1a) and that binding of FECV UU7 S protein on PBMCs was undetectable (Fig. S1b) . Using S fluorescent flow cytometry, we detected binding of FIPV UU4 S and FECV UU7 S protein on 15.5% and 7.4% of monocytes gated based on forward scatter and side scatter, respectively (Fig. S1D) . We observed no to minimal signals on both FCWF-4 cells and CRFK cells by S protein affinity fluorescent staining and flow cytometry ( Fig. S1C and E) . These results indicate that both FIPV UU4 S and FECV UU7 S proteins can recognize small numbers of feline monocytes, which supports that the contention that cell tropism between FIPV and FECV occurs at a post-receptor step of infection (40) . Additionally, S affinity histochemistry may be less sensitive for studying the attachment pattern of FECV I in paraffin-embedded tissues, which could be attributable to the low cellular receptor/co-receptor density of FECV I. Moreover, the limited growth of serotype I FCoVs in both FCWF-4 and CRFK cell lines was possibly caused by the poor binding affinity of FCoV I S protein to these cells.",
