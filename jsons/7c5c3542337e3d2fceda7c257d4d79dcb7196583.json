A choice of a threshold is subject to uncertainty caused by a method, the size of available data, a hypothesis on statistics, etc. We assess the degree of uncertainty by the Shannon's entropy calculated on the probability that the threshold changes at any given time. If the amount of data is not sufficient, an observer is in the state of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen who said \"When you say hill, I could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley\". If we have enough data, the uncertainty curve peaks at two values clearly separating the magnitudes of events into three emergency scales: subcritical, critical, and extreme. Our approach to defining the emergency scale is validated by 39 years of Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P500) historical data.",

The intersection of the three dimensions provides a detailed scale for defining any emergency [8] . In some papers, the threshold for an extreme event is related to the number of standard deviations from the average amplitude [9, 10] . However, existing empirical scales tend to describe the characteristics of the event itself rather that the consequences; such scales are ill-suited to describe emergencies in a way that is meaningful for response [11] .",

Unlike the Richter magnitude scale, the severity of flash crashes in financial markets is defined by the measures that need to be taken to ease panic such as halting trading. Under 2012 rules, market-wide circuit breakers (or 'curbs') kick in when the S&P 500 index drops 7% for Level 1; 13% for Level 2; and 20% for Level 3 from the prior days close. A market decline that triggers a Level 1 or 2 circuit breaker before 3:25 p.m. Eastern Time will halt trading for 15 minutes, but will not halt trading at or after 3:25 p.m. Circuit breakers can also be imposed on single stocks as opposed to the whole market. Under current rules, a trading halt on an individual security is placed into effect if there is a 10% change in value of a security that is a member of the S&P 500 Index within a 5-minute time frame, 30% change in value of a security whose price is equal or greater than $1 per share, and 50% change in value of a security whose price is less than $1 per share [14] . Ironically, in August 2015, single stock circuit breakers produced unprecedented disruption as 327 exchange-traded funds experienced more than 1000 trading halts during a single day.",

In addition to that, different distributions may admit asymptotic tails of the same appearance (a power law).

At this point we certain that events are not regular anymore. (III) We consider all events in this region extreme with our uncertainty decreasing. If these events are not extreme then what are they?

The log-return time series has a scale invariant structure when the structure repeats itself on sub-intervals of the signal, X(ct) = c H X(t), where the Hurst exponent H characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the auto-correlation function of the time series [25, 26, 27] . The larger Hurst exponent is visually seen as more slow evolving variations (i.e., more persistent structure) of the time series [26, 28, 29] . Processes with 0 < H < 0.5 exhibit antipersistence, with an increase in the process is likely to be followed by a decrease in the next time interval resulting in sample paths with a very rough structure [26, 28, 29] . On the contrary, values 0.5 < H < 1 lead to long-range dependence (\"long memory\") in the time series, with more likely the same sign of successive increments (persistence) and smoother sample trajectories. Finally, the time series constitutes random walks when H > 1 that have more apparent slow evolving fluctuations [26, 28, 29] . The q-order Hurst exponent H q is only one of several types of scaling exponents used to parameterize the multifractal structure of time series [26, 30] .",

In the model of extreme events under threshold uncertainty, the current value of the log-return is quantified by a random number x \u2208 [0, 1] drawn accordingly some probability distribution function Pr{x < z} = F (z). The threshold value that might change any time once the new data become available is another random number y \u2208 [0, 1], which is drawn from another probability distribution function, Pr{y < z} = G(z). We assume that the rate of daily variations of the log-return values is greater than or equal to that of the threshold values, ultimately determining whether the current log-return value is extreme or not.

In this situation, an observer's perception of the events reminds Red Queen from \"Through The Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\" by Lewis Carroll [21] who said \"When you say hill, I could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley\". Our understanding of the events whether they are extreme or not is very limited and uncertainty is blurry. As events become more severe, our uncertainty that the events are extreme decreases. The observer realizes that the events are extreme, but a precise point at which the events turn to be severe cannot be determined. This case is called the Red Queen State. (ii) As the window of observation becomes larger, 25 days, for instance, the uncertainty curve exhibits two maxima indicating that the amount of data is sufficient. This happens because H(\u03b7) attains its maximum for \u03b7 = 1/2 and the \u03b7 curve admits a value 1/2 twice (Fig. 14) . As we further extend the window the curve torrents into sharp peaks (Fig. 16) . The latter ones clearly separate the threshold values into three regions: three levels of emergency. The locations of peaks of the curves are summarized in Table 2 . The location of two peaks is not sensitive to the window of observation. to raise concern about extreme events. Then we can observe a spike with the degree of uncertainty attaining its first maximum. This extremum indicates a transition to the next kind of uncertainty. For the window of 2000 days, the region I lies in the interval [0, 0.00534) (see Fig. 16 , Table 2 ). (II) Critical. In the region II, the interval [0.00534, 0.01672) for the 2000-day window, uncertainty is conceptualized with a question whether a magnitude of the event is already critical, extreme or not yet. Further, we see another jump of uncertainty reaching 0.69034. At this point we are certain that events are not regular anymore. (III) Extreme. In the case of the window of 2000 days, the interval [0.01672, \u221e) constitutes the region III. We consider all events in this region extreme with our uncertainty decreasing as threshold values increase.",
