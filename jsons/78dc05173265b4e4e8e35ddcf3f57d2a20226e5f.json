This channel subtype is thought to mediate basal neurotransmitter release (Zhou and Misler, 1995) . In addition, it is known that Cav1 channels are coupled to large conductance Ca 2+ -and voltagedependent K + (BK) channels (Prakriya and Lingle 1999) , especially the Cav1.3 subtype (Marcantoni et al. 2010) . Cav1 channels control neurotransmitter release (L\u00f3 pez et al. 1994; Aldea et al. 2002; Polo-Parada et al. 2006) and are inhibited or potentiated by neurotransmitters or secondary messengers (Albillos et al. 1996; Carabelli et al. 2001; Cesetti et al. 2003) .",

The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor-594 (dilution 1 : 200, Molecular Probes), goat anti-rabbit (to label Cav1.2 and Cav1.3) and rabbit anti-goat (to label Cav1.1 and Cav1.4). Pre-adsorption controls were performed using control antigens for each primary antibody employed, which effectively avoided staining of our samples ruling out the possibility of nonspecific staining. After mounting the coverslips, fluorescence was determined using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).",

To recruit BK channels, short pre-pulses of 10 ms were applied at 0 mV before a 400 ms test pulse (V t ) to 140 mVor 180 mV; at these potentials, Ca 2+ did not occur during the pulse. To check that Ca 2+ entered exclusively during the pre-pulse, a pulse not preceded by the pre-pulse, which should evoke no secretion (reflected in the simultaneous C m measurement, data not shown), was first applied (Fig. 7a, upper part) . The potentiation of K + charge densities elicited by the prepulse was identical in both strains of mice, and amounted to 268.7 \u00b1 25% and 250 \u00b1 20% in WT and Cav1.3 )/) cells, respectively. The Ca 2+ dependent K + currents activated using this protocol were BK channels, as shown by their insensitivity to 200 nM apamin (blockade of 1.55 \u00b1 1% in five cells, only 11% in one cell), and their subsequent inhibition by 100 nM charybdotoxin (full inhibition in six out of six cells), that returned the current to the same level as the one elicited without a pre-pulse or after perfusion with CdCl 2 (200 lM) at the end of the experiment. Subsequent perfusion with tetraethylammonium (TEA, 45 mM) caused blockade of the total K + charge density of 82 \u00b1 2.5% (n = 6). BK currents represented 60.5 \u00b1 3.9% (n = 16) of the total K + current, and 80 \u00b1 2% (n = 5) of the TEA-sensitive K + current. The original traces of the currents elicited in the stationary state under each condition in a typical cell are shown in the lower part of Fig. 7(a) . Bar charts of normalized and averaged K + charge densities with respect to the current in the absence of a pre-pulse are provided in Fig. 7(b) .",

Nifedipine was initially tested at a concentration of 300 nM to selectively target Cav1.2 channels, and then a 3 lM concentration of the DHP was added to fully inhibit Cav1.2 and most Cav1.3 channels in WT cells. By averaging the action potentials recorded over 10 s in six WT cells and four Cav1.3 )/) cells, mean action potentials under each condition were obtained ( Fig. 8c and d) . In WT and Cav1.3 )/) cells, both concentrations of nifedipine significantly increased the half-height width, yet decreased the undershoot, the rate of depolarization, and the firing frequency. These changes in the shape and frequency of firing of the action potential were identical in both strains of mice, and could be explained by BK channel blockade subsequent to the inhibition mainly of Cav1.2 channels (see Discussion). These data also suggest that the blockade exerted by 300 nM nifedipine on Cav1.2 channels is incomplete at )40 mV (interspike potential). Thus, the higher frequency of firing in WT or Cav1.3 )/) cells in the presence of nifedipine 300 nM with respect to that observed in the presence of 3 lM nifedipine, indicates that partial and complete blockade of Cav1.2 channels, respectively, and consequently of BK channels, occurs under both conditions. The identical number of cells showing spontaneous firing and the similar firing frequency of WT cells when compared to Cav1.3 )/) cells is sufficient argument against a major role of Cav1.3 channels in action potential firing. However, to further investigate this issue, additional experiments were performed. First, the contribution of Cav1 channel subtypes to the inward current preceding the action potential was addressed. We constructed a phase-plane plot to identify the threshold potential for each mouse strain (Jenerick 1963) ( Fig. 9a and b) . The voltage stimuli applied were the mean action potentials obtained in Fig. 8(c and d) under control conditions for WT and Cav1.3 )/) cells.

Expression in heterologous systems revealed differences in the inactivation behavior of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels. Because of a \u00d3 2010 The Authors more pronounced Ca 2+ dependent inactivation, Cav1.3 channels could be faster inactivated with Ca 2+ as the charge carrier, but voltage-dependent inactivation (recorded in Ba 2+ ) appeared slower than in Cav1.2 channels (Koschak et al. 2001; Xu and Lipscombe 2001; Yang et al. 2006; Singh et al. 2008) . In native systems, Cav1.3 channels showed strong Ca 2+ dependent inactivation in the sinoatrial node and the endocrine pancreas (Plant 1988; Zhang et al. 2002; Mangoni et al. 2003) , while in inner hair cells Ca 2+ dependent inactivation was much weaker or absent (Platzer et al. 2000; Marcotti et al. 2003; Michna et al. 2003; Song et al. 2003) . This might be because of the inhibition of Ca 2+ dependent inactivation by Ca 2+ binding proteins (for a review see Striessnig 2007) . Co-expression of Cav1.3a1 with syntaxin, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) and synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP) also reduced the extent of Ca 2+ current inactivation (Song et al. 2003) . Our results might suggest that auxiliary subunits, or other channel associated proteins, could substantially condition the inactivation kinetics of Cav1 channels in the native system, and thus, give rise to differences with respect to channels expressed in heterologous systems. The function of Cav1 channel subtypes was explored in relation to cell excitability and exocytosis. Regarding cell excitability, Cav1.2 channels were mainly functionally coupled to BK channels (53% and 35% of 3 lM nifedipine blockade of BK channels, respectively, in WT and Cav1.3 )/) cells). This major coupling of Cav1.2 channels to BK channels is also reflected in the identical parameters of the action potentials obtained after nifedipine treatment (300 nM or 3 lM) in WT and Cav1.3 )/) cells (Fig. 8, Table 2 ). Thus, the coupling between BK and Cav1.2 channels here observed would explain the change in the action potential waveform elicited by nifedipine, such that it slowed down the repolarisation stage of the action potential, with the consequent broadening of the spike (Fig. 8, Table 2 ).",

Despite this being the opposite effect expected of blocking the entry of positively charged ions, it reflects powerful coupling to BK channels, so that the net effect is to inhibit a net outward current, that is, the K + flux triggered by the Ca 2+ entry outweighs the Ca 2+ entry itself, as has been previously reported (Jackson et al. 2004 ). The depolarization caused by the DHP might affect other conductances with the consequence of reducing the firing frequency (Bean 2007) .

Viroporins are a large family of viral proteins able to enhance membrane permeability, promoting virus budding. Mammalian cells are also readily permeabilized by the expression of MHV E protein (Madan et al. 2005) . They form cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers, with a high selectivity for Na + (Wilson et al. 2004 ). In addition, MHV infection induces an immediate and transient Ca 2+ increase in DBT cells, a murine astrocytoma cell line. The Ca 2+ increase is the result of the influx of Ca 2+ from the extracellular medium through Cav1 channels, as it is sensitive to nifedipine and verapamil (Kraeft et al. 1997) . This implies that Cav1 channels are affected by MHV infection. Thus, if the Na + and Ca 2+ channels involved in firing are in some way altered in MHV infected cells, action potential firing might also be influenced. Na + and Ca 2+ entry to the cytosol might depolarize and inactivate certain channels related to firing, Na + channels or Cav1 channel subtypes.

For instance, there is increased catecholamine release by the adrenal medulla during periods of stress and infection (Zhou and Jones 1993) . Further, cytokines stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leading to augmented glucocorticoid production by the adrenal cortex (Turnbull and Rivier 1995; Buckingham et al. 1996) . There are also direct paracrine interactions within the adrenal gland itself (Marx et al. 1998; Nussdorfer (a) (c) (b) Fig. 11 Contribution of Cav1 channel subtypes to the Ca 2+ charge and exocytosis of chromaffin vesicles.

Adrenal glands have a population of macrophages distributed throughout the cortex and medulla (Gonzalez-Hernandez et al. 1994; Schober et al. 1998) , some of which lie adjacent to the catecholamine producing chromaffin cells. Hence, in the particular case of MHV infection, this virus increases IL-6 production through p39 MAPK activation in macrophage-derived J774.1 cells (Banerjee et al. 2002) . It is known that IL-6 directly induces glucocorticoid production (Nussdorfer and Mazzocchi 1998; Willenberg et al. 2002) , which increases adrenaline synthesis by stimulation of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity (Wurtman and Axelrod 1966; Axelrod and Reisine 1984) . Adrenaline is preferentially a b-adrenergic agonist. b 1 and b 2 adrenergic receptors have been shown to modulate Cav1 channels in rat chromaffin cells (Cesetti et al. 2003) . Therefore, MHV infection could also modify the paracrine modulation of Cav1 channel function through enhanced stress and elevated medullary catecholamine secretion.",

Similarly, in our study, Cav1.2 channels were the Cav1 channel subtypes that were most quickly inactivated, and consequently, they will contribute to the faster voltage dependent inactivation of Na + channels. Na + and Ca 2+ channel inactivation are conditions required for subsequent initiation of Na + and/or Ca 2+ dependent action potentials to maintain repetitive firing.
