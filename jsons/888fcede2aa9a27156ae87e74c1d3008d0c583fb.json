These specimens were collected from November 2003 through October 2004 and were obtained from children hospitalized on a pediatric infectious diseases ward at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. No other respiratory virus was detected in specimens obtained from 14 of these children. A majority of these children had fever, and, of the 7 children who had chest radiography performed, 6 had abnormal finding [5] . HBoV has been detected in Australia and Japan. Of 324 Australian children with acute respiratory tract infection who had respiratory specimens submitted to a diagnostic laboratory, 18 (5.6%) tested positive for HBoV. These specimens were collected from May through August (i.e., autumn and winter in the Southern Hemisphere) in 2004 [8] . Eighteen (5.7%) of 318 Japanese children with lower respiratory tract infection tested positive for HBoV [9] . The finding of the aforementioned studies suggested that HBoV may be a common human virus; however, because none of these initial studies included a control group of asymptomatic children, it is difficul to draw any conclusions about causation. To determine whether HBoV circulated in New Haven, Connecticut, and to further defin the epidemiological profil and clinical characteristics associated with HBoV in young children, we screened respiratory specimens obtained from both symptomatic and asymptomatic infants and children (hereafter referred to as \"children\") for HBoV.",

[5] . The forward primer 5 -GACCTCT-GTAAGTACTATTAC-3 and the reverse primer 5 -CTCTGTG-TTGACTGAATACAG-3 target a portion of the HBoV NP-1 gene and produce a 354-bp amplicon that corresponds to nt 2351-2704 of the HBoV genome (GenBank accession number DQ000495). PCR amplificatio cycles were performed at 95\u040aC for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u040aC for 1 min, 54\u040aC for 1 min, and 72\u040aC for 2 min, and then by a fina extension cycle at 72\u040aC for 10 min [5] . Each set of PCRs contained appropriate negative controls. The authenticity of each amplicon was confi med by DNA sequencing. For phylogenetic analysis, regions of the VP1/VP2 genes were amplifie and sequenced. The forward primer 5 -GGACCACAGTCATCAGAC-3 and the reverse primer 5 -CCACTACCATCGGGCTG-3 target nt 4370-4387 and nt 5172-5189, respectively, of the HBoV genome, and PCR amplificatio yields a predicted amplicon of 819 bases.

The percentage of HBoV-positive specimens was similar to that noted in the limited numbers of clinical studies of HBoV infection [5, 8, 9] . It is unlikely that our finding were the result of PCR contami- nation. Each HBoV-positive specimen tested positive at least twice by use of independent PCR primers and reactions. Furthermore, each set of PCRs included appropriate negative controls. Several lines of evidence indicate that HBoV was the agent responsible for the disease observed in HBoV-positive children. All but one of the 22 HBoV-positive children tested negative for other respiratory viruses. Although the DFA and PCR screening tests that were used do not screen for all known respiratory viruses (such common viruses as rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were not included in the screening), and although the sensitivity of DFA for adenovirus is only 70% (one child whose respiratory specimen ultimately tested positive for adenovirus in cell culture was found to be negative for adenovirus by DFA), it is unlikely that another respiratory virus was present in 21 HBoV-positive specimens. Furthermore, none of the 96 asymptomatic children who had screening performed tested positive for HBoV. One potential explanation for the absence of HBoV in the asymptomatic children was that those children were selected and underwent screening during months (May to September) of the year-long study period in which HBoV apparently was not circulating. However, this was not the case. The respiratory specimens of 82.3% of asymptomatic children were collected in January-April and in October-December, the months during which HBoV was detected in specimens collected from symptomatic children.",

However, there are potential benefit to this approach. Screening is not limited to hospitalized children, as has been the case in other studies of HBoV infection [5] . Because respiratory specimens are often collected and screened for reasons other than the detection of respiratory tract disease (e.g., for the identificatio of the source of a fever), other manifestations of HBoV-associated disease not limited to the respiratory tract may be detected. Indeed, 5 of the HBoV-positive children had diarrhea, and 3 of these 5 children (2 children were hospitalized) had viral gastroenteritis diagnosed. Our study was not designed to evaluate the potential role of HBoV in gastrointestinal disease. However, both bovine parvovirus and minute virus of canines, the other 2 members of the genus Bocavirus (HBoV is the third member of this genus), cause enteric disease in their natural host [12, 13] . The potential role of HBoV in enteric disease will require further investigation.",

Rare nucleotide changes were observed in NP-1, and none of these polymorphisms resulted in amino acid changes. On the basis of the sequencing of 2 isolates, Allander et al. [5] found that nucleotide polymorphisms were most common in the VP1/VP2 gene of HBoV. Therefore, we hypothesized that sequencing of the VP1/VP2 gene of the New Haven isolates would allow for the most robust phylogenetic analysis. We sequenced the VP1/VP2 gene of \u223c50% of the isolates and found that the majority of nucleotide changes occurred in the 3 third of the VP1/VP2 cassette. Therefore, we sequenced the 3 third of the VP1/VP2 gene of all New Haven isolates. Although nucleotide polymorphisms were infrequent, there appeared to be at least 2 strains of HBoV circulating. A polymorphism in VP1/VP2 was observed at nt 4823 in the HBoV genome. This polymorphism resulted in either a serine or a threonine in the predicted amino acid sequence. This polymorphism was also present in ST1 and ST2, the original isolates identifie by Allander et al. [5] . Our finding indicate that the 2 genotypes of HBoV identifie in New Haven are remarkably similar to the genotypes of the initial strains of HBoV identifie in Sweden, and this suggests that the nucleotide sequences (of the NP-1 and VP1/VP2 genes, at least) are highly conserved among viruses circulating in different locations.",
