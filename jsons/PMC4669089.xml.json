Positive-strand RNA viruses sequester the entire replication machinery to ultrastructurally-distinctive membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartments (termed replication factories) that they generate by massively re-engineering host organelle membranes [3]. For example, dengue virus replication occurs inside elaborately convoluted vesicles that contain viral dsRNA. High-resolution electron microscope tomography shows a continuous endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranous network with small pores through which plus-strand progeny genomes are released to the cytoplasm [4]. The RdRP of poliovirus, a picornavirus, is similarly associated with complex virus-engineered membranous structures although the precise morphology and topology, with respect to the cellular milieu, are unclear. Immuno-electron microscopic labeling has suggested that the poliovirus replication complex localizes to the cytoplasmic face of compact membrane vesicles that are, in turn, surrounded by larger elongated (rosette-like) vesicular structures [5,6,7].",

Whole-genome mRNA microarray analyses of spinal cords from uninfected WT mice and EMCV-infected WT mice revealed that 37 genes (fold change criterion > 4.0 and P < 0.05) were upregulated significantly, up to 26.5-fold, in EMCV-infected mice compared to uninfected WT controls (Fig 1A WT+EMCV, S1A Fig, S1 Table). In striking contrast, in spinal cords of uninfected RdRP mice, 80 gene mRNAs were elevated significantly. In addition, this baseline upregulation was quantitatively dramatic, up to 114-fold compared to uninfected WT controls (Fig 1A RdRP, S1A Fig, S2 Table), and of the 80 elevated genes, 30 (38%) were elevated more than 10-fold. Importantly, of the 37 genes upregulated following lethal viral infection in WT mice, 97% were intrinsically upregulated > 4-fold in uninfected RdRP mice. In spinal cords from EMCV-infected RdRP mice, 79 genes were significantly upregulated, up to 124-fold, compared with uninfected WT controls (Fig 1A RdRP+EMCV, S1A Fig, S3 Table). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the gene patterns of uninfected RdRP and virus-infected RdRP mice. These results demonstrate that RdRP mice possess, at baseline, a maximally upregulated innate immune transcriptome which is capable of effecting a robust antiviral response. In both breadth and extent, it far exceeds the innate immune gene inductions produced by virus infection itself (80 vs. 37 genes, mean fold induction 13.9-fold in uninfected RdRP vs. 8.5-fold in EMCV-infected WT).",

Here we carried out gene expression analyses and heterologous viral challenges with EMCV to determine the mechanism; RdRP-Rag1\n-/- mice maintain constitutive upregulation of antiviral ISGs (Fig 2A and 2B), exhibit up to 5.5-logs reduced viral transcript loads (Fig 2C), and survive lethal EMCV challenge (Fig 2D).

Viral molecular and structural motifs are detected by the cell-intrinsic innate immune system using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). TLR3 is a PRR localized to the endosomal compartments, and RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 are RIG-I-like receptor RNA helicases with essential roles in cytosolic viral sensing [21,22]. Recognition of viral motifs activates receptor-proximal signaling molecules, namely TRIF in the TLR3 pathway and MAVS in the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway, which converge on phosphorylation of members of the IFN regulatory factor family and production of type I IFNs. IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 engagement with the cognate receptor (IFN\u03b1\u03b2R) on the plasma membrane recruits transcription factors which bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) to upregulate ISGs [2]. IFN-stimulated effectors can also be activated through the IFN\u03b3R and transcription factor binding to IFN\u03b3-activated site (GAS) promoter elements. Normally, these responses are highly constrained temporally, with acute sensor activation and ISG upregulation after the onset of viral infection, followed by resolution to baseline as infection is controlled by innate and adaptive immune responses.",

Reverse transcriptase activity-normalized vectors were used to transduce A549 cells followed by selection in puromycin to produce stable lines. Doxycycline (DOX) was added to the media to induce RdRP or RdRP\u0394cat expression. Then, subsets of cells were harvested and assayed for ISG induction 24 and 48 hr after DOX treatment.

These virus-induced rearrangements of host cell membranes were originally characterized based on their ability to increase efficiency and concentrate components of the viral replication process. Termed replication factories, these enclosures house viral proteases, viral genomes, replication intermediates, and RdRPs [3,28]. For picornaviruses, replication factory assembly is a complex, ordered process requiring viral translation, intracellular membrane rearrangement, vesicle budding and viral RNA synthesis. Studies of poliovirus have suggested that endoplasmic-reticulum derived vesicles coalesce to form rosette-shaped membrane structures with viral replicative intermediates sequestered within the complex [5,6,7]. To what extent these membranous structures prevent interaction of the picornavirus RdRP and its dsRNA products with cytosolic components (such as nucleic acid sensors) is unknown. However, plant experiments in the 1990s suggested that transgenic RdRP expression can activate innate immunity in tissues of a multicellular eukaryote [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Whether RdRP expression can similarly reconfigure innate immunity in vertebrate animals was previously not known.",

The effect requires the MDA5-MAVS pathway, implying that dsRNA produced by the RdRP is the effective trigger. Indeed, we show the presence of endogenous dsRNA in neural tissue of uninfected RdRP mice (S4 Fig), and we hypothesize that this is due to nonspecific replicase activity similar to previously published reports of dsRNA generation following ectopic expression of viral RdRPs in vitro. For example, Nikonov and colleagues have shown that transient expression of the intact Semliki Forest virus RdRP protein activates IFN\u03b2 production in mammalian cell lines [16]. The authors determined that nonspecific replicase activity produced RNA PAMPs with the following characteristics: >200 nucleotides in length, non-polyadenylated, double-stranded, and containing a 5\u2019-phosphate. The authors identified a putative RdRP-specific RNA clone, albeit within a mixture of PAMPs, that was complimentary to mouse antisense non-coding mitochondrial RNA 1, and they concluded that the Semliki Forest virus RdRP can induce IFN\u03b2 via dsRNA generation by templating on host RNA. Importantly, in this case sensing of dsRNA products was mediated through both RIG-I and MDA5 since knockdown of either sensor alone was not sufficient to completely abolish innate immune activation [16]. Similar to these results, we show that when the TMEV RdRP is expressed transgenically (in the complete absence of other viral proteins), the presence of endogenous dsRNA accompanies PRR-mediated innate immune activation. In contrast, however, our data demonstrate that knockout of MDA5 completely blocks TMEV RdRP-induced ISG activation (S2D Fig) which results in compromised murine survival following viral infection (Fig 3D). Therefore, we hypothesize the nonspecific TMEV replicase activity produces dsRNA by templating on host RNA, which in turn activates MDA5-MAVS-mediated ISG activation. However, a role for RIG-I in this system cannot be ruled out at present.",

The quintessential outcome of aberrant MDA5 activation has heretofore been documented in genetic association studies of autoimmune disorders and type I interferonopathies. Human SNPs in both MAVS [29] and MDA5 [30] carry increased risk of developing SLE. In a genome-wide association study, MDA5 was also identified as a susceptibility locus for autoimmune type 1 diabetes [31]. More recently, rare missense gain-of-function MDA5 mutations were shown to cause AGS, an inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the skin and nervous system. Affected individuals presented with a range of disease phenotypes in which elevated ISG expression due to enhanced interferon state was central to pathogenesis [18]. Similar clinical manifestations have also been reported in mice harboring a single missense mutation (G821S) in MDA5 resulting in an autoactivated form [19].",

However, in the present study, we neither detected induction of Ifn\u03b1 nor Ifn\u03b2 mRNAs in our microarray gene expression profiling of spinal cord tissue in which ISG mRNAs were highly elevated (S5A Fig and S2 Table). Furthermore, basal plasma type I IFN levels were not elevated (S5B Fig, 0 hr), and RdRP mice displayed attenuated type I IFN induction following administration of the dsRNA analogue, poly(I:C) (S5B Fig, 14 hr). In RdRP-expressing THP-1 monocytes, neither human IFN\u03b1 nor IFN\u03b2 mRNAs were significantly upregulated in our gene expression profiling studies despite ISG mRNA induction of up to 560-fold (S4 Table). Inducible expression of the RdRP in A549 cells, however, resulted in an early wave (48 hr) of 8-fold IFN\u03b2 induction (Fig 6C).",

Conventional strategies to prevent and treat viral diseases generally focus on inducing antigen-specific adaptive immunity (vaccines) or targeting specific viral molecules (restriction factors, antiviral drugs). Such approaches must be tailored to each virus or to a limited group of closely related viruses and cannot broadly prevent infection or diseases caused by viruses from diverse families. The innate immune system is not antigen-specific but functions instead to sense a variety of viral motifs. Activation of the cell-intrinsic viral sensing pathway empowers broadly antiviral capabilities via ISG activation [35,36,37,38,39,40]. Consistent with these data, we have shown that augmenting host innate immune responses can stably (Fig 1D), safely (Fig 4), rapidly (Fig 6C), and broadly (EMCV, HIV-1, TMEV, vesicular stomatitis virus, pseudorabies virus) [17,20] protect against viral disease. Therapeutic stimulation of innate immune pathways in this way may adequately limit the replication and spread of novel virulent pathogens. Collectively, these data provide sufficient evidence to motivate future antiviral development endeavors that critically evaluate materials and methods for safely augmenting host innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum viral attenuation.",
