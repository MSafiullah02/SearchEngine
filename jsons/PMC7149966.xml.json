It is the latter barrier that serves as the backup in the event of the failure of the other arms of the innate immune system and also perhaps is the most recognized given the myriad of symptoms including edema, redness, and fever that are produced with the complex interactions of cytokines, chemokines, and APP.",

While the antigen receptor and its required gene recombination events are a more recent evolutionary acquisition of vertebrates, the innate immune system represents the core from which the adaptive immune system was based. Additionally, these two systems are often examined as mediating separate events. There is a true interface between the APR and adaptive immunity. Yoo and colleagues, with the use of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mice, demonstrated that the APR mobilizes antigen presentation by hepatocytes via MHC class I.13 Others have demonstrated that the elimination of toll-like receptors affects both innate and adaptive immune responses.15, 16\n",

The area of major APP production is the liver; specifically, the induction of APP expression in hepatocytes. APP have also been noted to be produced in other tissues.

At the research level, proteomic profiling has been utilized. With the maturation of immunoassays, immunodiffusion tests, ELISA, and immunoturbidimetric assays have been employed. Where possible, colorimetric assays have also been implemented. Lastly, the APR has been broadly judged by the use of serum protein electrophoresis. This method provides quantitation of albumin and then fractions of APP which are grouped as alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma globulins based on their migration characteristics.33 Major benefits of this method are not having the need for species-specific reagents and the assessment of the complete APR\u2014albumin and the groups of APP. Protein electrophoresis has been commonly implemented in avian species as an adjunct test to infectious disease assessments.69, 70 A negative to this assay is the limits of detection as fraction sensitivity is at the g/dL level rather than the mg/L level obtained by specific APP assays.71\n",

In a rat model of LPS stimulation, significantly decreased HP and AGP were observed in aged animals.77 In dogs injected with turpentine oil, significantly higher levels of CRP were found in dogs over 3 months versus 1 month of age.78 Lower resting levels of AGP were observed in these very young dogs versus older dogs prompting the proposal that age should be considered when using and interpretating APP results.79 Similar recommendations were made for newborn dairy calves that gave high levels of APP post-birth followed by a significant decrease through day 21 and eventual stabilization.80\n",

Similarly, a disorder in cattle called traumatic reticuloperitonitis (related to foreign body ingestion) is difficult to diagnose with just a general examination and often requires radiology and surgery.93 The use of SAA and HP quantitation provided 100% sensitivity and 86% specificity. Lastly, a large study was undertaken to examine cattle with acute and chronic disorders.35 SAA levels were found to be consistently fivefold higher in acutely ill animals versus those with chronic processes and were reported to provide 100% sensitivity in the discrimination between these conditions. The slower forming HP response provided a specificity of 76%. The combined use of APP has been the subject of study, and an APP value index has been proposed for diagnosis and monitoring of clinically ill humans and animals.94\n",

Recent terms have been coined including \u201cmetainflammatory\u201d and \u201cparainflammatory\u201d and refer to the observation that chronic elevations of APP have been associated with the onset of different syndromes including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular conditions, obesity, asthma, and diabetes.123, 124 It is suggested that the classic APR results in tissue repair and the metainflammatory APR are initiated with the same mechanisms, but self-tissues are the target rather than pathogens or other inflammatory stimuli in the latter process.",

The fibril protein AA is derived from the SAA and deposited in tissues as amyloid where it gradually affects tissue function. In early subclinical stages of disease, SAA levels have been reported to be elevated in NHP and genetically predisposed Abyssinian cats.131, 132\n",

However, our laboratory has demonstrated a utility for APP quantitation in dogs in a large specialty veterinary practice. In a study of over 200 dogs, a mean increase of 20-fold and 7-fold was observed for CRP and HP, respectively (C. Cray, 2011).

SAA was reported to have the highest diagnostic sensitivity for inflammatory disease in this species versus FIB, HP, and total WBC. We have similarly observed SAA to be a valuable prognostic marker in stressed and injured manatees. (C. Cray, 2011). In other studies, specific CRP assays were produced for use with serum samples from harbor seals.229 Animals with pneumonia and other inflammatory processes were found to have as much as a 50-fold increase. HP in harbor seals was characterized in two recent publications.230, 231\n",

The APR is conserved among different species which is a further reflection of its critical function. Although there is marked species variation among the proteins, this has not only resulted in a wealth of publications in different animals but has also facilitated the development of several species-specific and heterologous assays which can be employed to quantitate APP. The implementation of these assays has provided results that have demonstrated clear benefits at the research level with the association of APP with diagnosis, prognosis, the detection of subclinical disease, and applications to food safety. The excitement regarding the applications of APP has been measurable for years.6, 9, 232, 233 At this time, the only impediments are the need for education and acceptance of veterinary practitioners and the more ready access to these methods at the reference laboratory level. APP testing which is available today represents just the start of newly emerging biomarkers for use in animals. As technology improves and research studies ensue, a further understanding of APP and the APR in animals will result in an important step in health monitoring, understanding innate immunity, and potential therapeutic interventions of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases in animals and humans.",
