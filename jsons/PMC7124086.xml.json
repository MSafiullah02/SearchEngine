            "text": "By the fifth week of gestation, the pancreas arises as two outpouchings from the junction of the foregut and midgut. The large dorsal bud enlarges rapidly and contributes to most of the pancreas. The small ventral bud contributes to the uncinate process and the inferior part of the head of the pancreas. The ventral bud, connected to the bile duct, rotates with the duodenum and fuses with the dorsal bud. By the seventh week of gestation, as the two buds join, the ventral duct fuses with the dorsal duct to form the main pancreatic duct (duct of Wirsung). This duct communicates with the common bile duct before entering the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater. The proximal portion of the dorsal duct forms the accessory duct of Santorini, which opens separately above the main papilla. Developmental deviation from these steps may result in clinically significant anomalies as will be discussed later. The pancreatic acini and the islets of Langerhans start developing during the third month of gestation.",

These pancreatic enzymes are thus activated in the intestine where the digestive process takes place. Endopeptidases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase) cleave internal bonds within protein chains. Exopeptidases (carboxypeptidase A and B) cleave the bond adjacent to either the amino or carboxyl terminus.
