            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes the major public health problems worldwide. Over the past two decades, the prognosis of chronic hepatitis B has been significantly improved due to the emergence of two formulations of interferon and five orally administered nucleos(t)ide analogs (Yuen and Lai, 2011). However, the prolonged use of nucleos(t)ide analogs frequently result in the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants, which are responsible for therapeutic failure and progression of liver disease (Hongthanakorn et al., 2011). It is reported that up to 76% of the patients developed viral resistance after 5 years of lamivudine therapy (Yuen et al., 2009). The signature mutations rtM204V/I, which have been mapped in the conserved tyrosine\u2013methionine\u2013aspartate\u2013aspartate (YMDD) motif within the C domain of the reverse transcriptase (RT), are frequently associated with lamivudine resistance (Allen et al., 1998). Furthermore, they are often associated with the compensatory mutations rtL180M or rtV173L in the B domain of the RT, which partially restore the replicative capacity of the YMDD mutation strains (Delaney et al., 2003, Enomoto et al., 2007). One in vitro study demonstrated that drug susceptibility decreased over 10,000-fold once lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants were selected (Lada et al., 2004). Moreover, the rapid progression or acute exacerbation of hepatitis usually occurs after the emergence of lamivudine resistance (Suzuki et al., 2006). Thus, the discovery and development of novel anti-HBV drugs with innovative targets are urgently needed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, especially for rescue therapy of drug-resistant patients.",

Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH) is a compound manufactured by salification from cepharanthine, which is a natural biscoclaurine alkaloid extracted from Stephania cepharantha Hayata. CH has attracted increasing scientific attention in recent years due to the extent of its biological activities, including antitumor, antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, and its ability to promote leukocyte, induce apoptosis and reverse multidrug resistance induced by long-term chemotherapy (Rogosnitzky and Danks, 2011). With regard to the antiviral activity of CH, thus far there have been several reports on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Baba et al., 2001), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Zhang et al., 2005) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Liu et al., 2004). However, the in vitro anti-HBV activity of CH has never been explored until our recent unpublished observations demonstrated that CH was an efficient inhibitor of wild-type HBV in the stable HBV-producing cell line HepG2.2.15.",

Unfortunately, the patient's serum HBV DNA rebounded to 4.8 \u00d7 106\n copies/ml after a total of 16 months of lamivudine monotherapy, and continued to rise to the initial level 3 months later. At this time point, a genotypic analysis by direct sequencing of the entire polymerase RT region of the circulating HBV was performed and revealed the presence of rtV173L/L180M/M204V triple mutations, but not additional lamivudine resistance-conferring mutations. The resistant HBV strain was genotype B. The patient was seropositive for HBsAg and HBeAg. Serum samples were collected before lamivudine therapy and after viral breakthrough, respectively, for drug susceptibility analysis.

Many natural herbs and related active compounds have been reported to have promising, distinctive and potent anti-HBV activities.

Consequently, HBV in chronically infected patients harbor many virus quasispecies which contain a diversity of genetic context. Presently, the in vitro drug susceptibility assessments of HBV mutants commonly depend on the methods that artificially reproduce one or a few resistant mutations, usually by site-directed mutagenesis of a laboratory strain, on a wild-type virus backbone (Brunelle et al., 2006, Jacquard et al., 2006). However, viruses created by the site-directed mutagenesis of a laboratory strain would not contain the natural genetic context of a mutation identified in clinical strains, and discrepancies between the susceptibilities to antivirals of laboratory- and patient-derived HBV mutants will emerge (Brunelle et al., 2007).

To gain new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of HBV by CH, we assessed the effect of in vitro CH treatment on host Hsc70 mRNA by RT-PCR. The results showed that CH inhibited host Hsc70 mRNA expression in parallel with the inhibitory effect on intracellular HBV replication, illustrating that CH may suppress HBV via downregulation of host Hsc70 expression.

Interestingly, the reduction of Hsc70 mRNA by CH did not cause apparent negative effects on the growth of human HepG2 cells (unpublished observations). Nevertheless, the downregulation of the protein and the exact mechanism of the downregulation of Hsc70 by CH deserve further studies.
