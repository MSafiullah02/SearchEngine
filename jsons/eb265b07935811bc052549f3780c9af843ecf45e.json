            "text": "RNA virus encodes a helicase essential for viral RNA transcription and replication when the genome size is larger than 7 kb. Coronavirus (CoV) has an exceptionally large RNA genome (~30 kb) and it encodes an essential replicase, the nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13), a member of superfamily 1 helicases. Nsp13 is among the evolutionary most conserved proteins not only in CoVs but also in nidovirales. Thus, it is considered as an important drug target. However, the high-resolution structure of CoV nsp13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, which hindered the structure-based drug design. This is in part due to the intrinsic flexibility of nsp13. Here, we describe protocols of deducing the crystal structure of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) helicase in detail, which include protein expression, purification, crystallization, enzymatic characterization, and structure determination. With these methods, catalytically active recombinant MERS-CoV nsp13 protein can be prepared and crystallized and the crystal structure can be solved.",

            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) remains a public health concern 16 years after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [1] . The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, reemerged in 2015, and is still circulating in the Middle East region, which reminds the international community that the threat of CoVs persists [2, 3] . However, neither vaccine nor drugs against CoVs are currently available. Outbreaks of CoVs initiated extensive structural investigation on CoV encoded proteins thereafter, which not only shed light on the life cycle of CoVs but also laid foundation for the structure-based drug design (SBDD). CoV contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome of~30 kb, one of the largest among +RNA viruses [4, 5] . To maintain the unusually large RNA genome, CoV encodes two replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are broken down into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) via proteinase cleavage [6, 7] . The nsps are then recruited to cytoplasm membranes, on which they form the membraneassociated replication-transcription complex (RTC). An RNAdependent RNA polymerase nsp12 and a helicase nsp13 are the central components of RTC [8, 9] . However, while high-resolution structures of most CoV encoded proteins had been determined soon after SARS-CoV outbreak, the first CoV nsp13 structure, MERS-CoV nsp13, was only solved recently [10] . Nsp13 belongs to helicase superfamily 1 and shares conserved features with the eukaryotic Upf1 helicase [11, 12] . Nsp13 is a multi-domain protein comprising of an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH domain) and a C-terminal SF1 helicase core [10] . Nsp13 exhibits multiple enzymatic activities, including hydrolysis of NTPs and dNTPs, unwinding of DNA and RNA duplexes with 5 0 -3 0 directionality and the RNA 5 0 -triphosphatase activity [13, 14] . To investigate the structure of CoV nsp13, we overexpressed the full-length MERS-CoV nsp13 (1-598aa) in insect cells and purified. The activity of the recombinant MERS-CoV nsp13 was verified by ATPase and helicase assays. Crystallization of MERS-CoV nsp13 was achieved by adding a synthetic single-stranded 15 poly dT DNA with 5 0 -triphosphate (ppp-15 T) to the protein, which restrains the intrinsic flexibility of nsp13. Benefiting from the presence of an N-terminal zinc-binding domain with three zinc atoms, multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data at the zinc absorption edge was collected, which allowed the determination of the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 [10] .",

We have tried four concentrations of NaCl in lysis buffer, including 300 mM, 500 mM, 1 M, and 1.5 M. The first three concentrations of NaCl render the supernatant to be unable to use, we can't improve it by highspeed centrifugation (47,850 \u00c2 g), and it also can't be filtered by 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter. The last concentration, 1.5 M NaCl in lysis buffer, could generate a bit better supernatant of cell lysates than other three concentrations of salt. We centrifuge the supernatant twice, then can filter it by 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filters (100 mL supernatant consumed about 8-10 filters).
