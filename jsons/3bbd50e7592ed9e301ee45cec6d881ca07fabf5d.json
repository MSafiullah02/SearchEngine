            "text": "Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is an excellent candidate to regulate remyelination based on its proposed actions in oligodendrocyte lineage cell development in conjunction with its involvement in CNS regeneration. To assess the potential for FGF2 to play a role in remyelination, we examined the expression pattern of FGF2 and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in an experimental demyelinating disease with extensive remyelination. Adult mice were intracranially injected with murine hepatitis virus strain A-59 (MHV-A59) to induce focally demyelinated spinal cord lesions that spontaneously remyelinate, with corresponding recovery of motor function. Using kinetic RT-PCR analysis of spinal cord RNA, we found significantly increased levels of FGF2 mRNA transcripts, which peaked during the initial stage of remyelination. Analysis of tissue sections demonstrated that increased levels of FGF2 mRNA and protein were localized within demyelinated regions of white matter, including high FGF2 expression associated with astrocytes. The expression of corresponding FGF receptors was significantly increased in lesion areas during the initial stage of remyelination. In normal and lesioned white matter, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, including progenitors and mature cells, were found to express multiple FGFR types (FGFR1, FGFR2, and/or FGFR3). In addition, in lesion areas, astrocytes expressed FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. These findings indicate that, during remyelination, FGF2 may play a role in directly regulating oligodendrocyte lineage cell responses and may also act through paracrine or autocrine effects on astrocytes, which are known to synthesize other growth factors and immunoregulatory molecules that influence oligodendrocyte lineage cells.",

            "text": "Remyelination involves a recapitulation of developmental events occurring in a pathological environment. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is likely to be an important regulator of remyelination based on its proposed actions in oligodendrocyte lineage cell development in conjunction with its association with CNS injury. FGF2 is expressed in the developing and adult CNS, and its role may be accentuated in pathological states by enhanced expression and activation. In normal CNS tissues FGF2 is synthesized by neurons and astrocytes and in some areas microglia (Hatten et al., 1988; Woodward et al., 1992; Gonzalez et al., 1995; Redwine et al., 1997) . Pathological conditions induce FGF2 synthesis by astrocytes and macrophage/microglia cells (Logan et al., 1992; Mocchetti et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1998) . In wound fluids, FGF2 activity may be enhanced by heparanases that degrade the ectodomain of soluble syndecan-1, which then converts from an inhibitor of FGF2 to become a potent activator (Kato et al., 1998) . The range of effects of FGF2 in CNS pathology have not been fully elucidated. Improvement in the survival of injured neurons has been demonstrated with FGF2 administration (Grothe and Unsicker, 1992; Teng et al., 1999) . In vitro data and developmental studies suggest that FGF2 may also influence oligodendrocyte lineage cell responses following CNS demyelination (Wolswijk and Noble, 1995; Armstrong, 2000) .",

In vitro, FGF2 appears to influence every stage of oligodendrocyte development. FGF2 is an important factor for in vitro treatment of embryonic stem cells to generate oligodendrocytes (Ben-Hur et al., 1998; Br\u00fcstle et al., 1999) . FGF2 may act independently, or in combination with other factors, to induce oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) proliferation and migration (McKinnon et al., 1990; Milner et al., 1997; Simpson and Armstrong, 1999) . Differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells is arrested and/or reversed in the presence of FGF2 (Grinspan et al., 1996; Bansal and Pfeiffer, 1997) . Consistent with these in vitro findings, exogenous FGF2 increases the number of promyelinating oligodendrocytes and retards myelination in vivo (Goddard et al., 1999) . These diverse effects of FGF2 on oligodendrocyte lineage cells may reflect the differential expression of FGFRs with cell maturation (Bansal et al., 1996) and the interplay of FGF2 with other regulatory molecules.",

The FGFR1 ribonucleotide probe (Dr. Alka Mansukhani, New York University School of Medicine) contained 1.2 kb of the 5\u0408 end of the murine flg receptor (nucleotides 1-1,177). Similar results were also observed using a smaller probe that hybridized to nucleotides 843-1,170 of the mouse FGFR1 sequence (Dr. David Ornitz; Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO). The FGFR3 ribonucleotide probe (Dr. David Ornitz) hybridizes to nucleotides 1,233-1,663 of the mouse sequence, which should detect each of the differentially spliced FGFR3 isoforms (Chellaiah et al., 1994; Johnston et al., 1995; Ornitz et al., 1996) .

A: Mice intracranially injected with MHV-A59 or PBS were tested for limb motor impairment (hang time) and sacrificed for RNA isolation from spinal cords. Analysis was carried out in parallel for MHV-injected and age-matched PBS-injected (control) mice at various days postinjection (dpi) throughout the progression of demyelination and remyelination. Limb motor impairment was scored by the time that mice could support their weight by grasping the bars of a cage top. Hang time scores indicate significant motor function impairment at 7-21 dpi, with maximal impairment at 10 dpi (P \u03fd 0.001 for 7, 10, 14, 21 dpi each; compared to preinjection baseline values in which each mouse recorded a maximal time of 60 sec for this assay; ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis), with almost complete recovery at 28 dpi (*P \u03fd 0.001 for 28 dpi vs. 10 dpi; ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis). B: FGF2 mRNA transcript abundance was determined in these behaviorally tested mice by kinetic RT-PCR analysis using the ABI Prism 7700 \"TaqMan\" system. FGF2 mRNA values were normalized to 18s rRNA values for the cDNA sample generated from the same RT reaction. FGF2 mRNA transcript levels for MHV affected mice were 533% higher than PBS control values at the 28 dpi stage, when motor function recovery was almost complete. FGF2 mRNA values from MHV-affected mice were significantly elevated at this 28 dpi stage of the disease progression (P \u03fd 0.05 for 28 dpi vs. 8 dpi; ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc comparison). The same mice were used in the behavioral tests and the RNA isolation (8 dpi, N \u03ed 4 MHV and 3 PBS; 14, 28, and 42 dpi, N \u03ed 3 MHV and 3 PBS for each dpi).

By 4 wpi, in correlation with histological signs of early remyelination (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) , mice almost completely recovered motor function. FGF2 mRNA transcript levels (Fig. 1B) began to increase after the period of maximal motor impairment (10 dpi) and increased to 533% of control values during the early remyelination phase (28 dpi).

In both PBS (control)-and MHV-A59injected mice at 4 wpi, FGF2 mRNA transcripts were readily detected in the perinuclear cytoplasm of neurons in spinal cord gray matter. Focal areas of demyelinated white matter lesions in MHV-infected spinal cords were identified by loss of myelin, using darkfield microscopy (not shown; Redwine and Armstrong, 1998; Armstrong, 2000) , as well as by signs of vacuolation, gliosis, and cellular infiltrates. Lesioned white matter consistently ex- hibited a high density of cells with intense signal from hybridization with the FGF2 antisense ribonucleotide probe. In comparison, nonlesioned white matter exhibited a relatively low FGF2 signal associated with glial-like cells distributed throughout spinal cord sections. Similar results were obtained with two different antisense FGF2 ribonucleotide probes (not shown). Ribonucleotide probes transcribed as the sense strand were not used as controls for nonspecific hybridization, because expression of antisense FGF2 mRNA transcripts has been reported (Grothe and Meisinger, 1995) . The specificity of the FGF2 antisense hybridization was confirmed by the marked decrease of signal in tissue sections from knockout mice lacking FGF2 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 2C) .",

In lesions, as in normal tissue, FGFR1 appeared to be expressed by cells of multiple glial morphologies, the most intense immunoreactivity being apparent in cells with the distinctive morphology of reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4D) . We previously reported that OPs exhibit increased density in lesion areas and are immunolabeled by a monoclonal antibody recognizing mainly FGFR1 (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . We wanted to characterize more specifically FGFR1 expression by adult OPs because of the proposed requirement of FGFR1 for neonatal OP migration (Osterhout et al., 1997) .

In normal spinal cord, FGFR3 was detected in neurons of the gray matter and in distributed glial-like cells of the white matter (Fig.  7A) . Within demyelinated white matter lesions (4 wpi), the density of cells labeled by FGFR3 mRNA was significantly increased (Fig. 7B,F) , and the FGFR3 immunoreactivity was correspondingly increased (Fig. 7C,D) . Immunolabeling with cell type-specific markers demonstrated that multiple cell types express FGFR3 mRNA and protein in normal and lesioned white matter (Fig. 8) . In normal white matter, OPs identified by expression of PDGF\u2423R were double immunolabeled for FGFR3 (Fig.  8A ). Mature oligodendrocytes, identified by the CC1 monoclonal antibody, also were double immunolabeled for FGFR3 (Fig. 8B,C) . A subset of white matter astrocytes and microglia, identified by GFAP and by Mac-1 immunoreactivity, respectively, also showed FGFR3 double immunolabeling in normal tissue (not shown). In each cell type, the subcellular distribution of FGFR3 immunoreactivity was stronger in the nucleus than the cytoplasm in the normal tissue. This subcellular distribution is consistent with previous reports of FGFR3 immunoreactivity (Johnston et al., 1995; Sogos et al., 1998) . In the demyelinated lesions (4 wpi), reactive astrocytes exhibited strong nuclear and cytoplasmic FGFR3 immunoreactivity (Fig. 8D) , as did many microglia (not shown), consistent with findings in kainic acid-lesioned rat brain (Ballabriga et al., 1997) . We more specifically examined FGFR3 expression by OPs, because, as noted above, the density of OPs in early remyelinating lesions is increased, whereas that of identifiable mature oligodendrocytes is still decreased. In addition, FGFR3 is expressed by neural progenitors during development (Peters et al., 1993) and so might continue to be expressed by adult progenitors. To identify individual OPs clearly, we cultured cells from MHV-lesioned spinal cord at 4 wpi. OPs immunolabeled for NG2 consistently exhibited FGFR3 mRNA signal at the bipolar stage as well as after multiple processes were elaborated (Fig. 8E-H) .",

Using this experimental model, we found that FGF2 ligand mRNA expression is significantly increased during an early stage of remyelination. This increased FGF2 expression is spatially localized to areas of demyelination, with especially intense FGF2 mRNA and protein signal associated with reactive astrocytes. We also found that FGFR expression is significantly increased within lesions during this early stage of remyelination. With respect to remyelination, FGFR expression by OPs in the adult CNS is of particular interest in that these cells appear to be a source of remyelinating cells in experimental models Gensert and Goldman, 1997; Carroll et al., 1998; Keirstead et al., 1998; Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . We demonstrate FGFR1 and FGFR3 expression by OPs, which we have previously shown express PDGF\u2423R and exhibit vigorous proliferation during remyelination in this model (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . We also show that, in normal adult CNS, mature oligodendrocytes express FGFR3 in addition to the previously reported expression of FGFR1 and/or FGFR2 (Asai et al., 1993; Yazaki et al., 1994; Gonzalez et al., 1995; Miyake et al., 1996; Belluardo et al., 1997; Redwine et al., 1997; Jiang et al., 1999) . The differential expression of FGFR types by oligodendrocyte lineage cells may provide a mechanism for FGF2 to influence differentially proliferation, migration, differentiation, and/or survival as required for oligodendrocyte lineage cells to repopulate lesions and accomplish stable remyelination.",

Although we have not yet identified the molecular signals that trigger the observed up-regulation of FGF2, the increased expression of FGF2 in this MHV-A59 model does not appear to reflect a response that is specific to this method of inducing demyelination or to components specific to this lesion environment. Inflammatory demyelination of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Liu et al., 1998) and toxin-induced demyelination using lysolecithin injection (Hinks and Franklin, 1999) each exhibit increased FGF2 expression. Whether increased expression of FGFRs also occurs in these other demyelinating models has not been addressed.",

            "text": "A potentially important interaction relative to growth factor regulation of remyelination is that FGF2 increases expression of PDGF\u2423R (McKinnon et al., 1990) and NG2 on neonatal OPs (Nishiyama et al., 1996b) . In response to demyelination, increased local expression of FGF2 (present results) might augment OP expression of PDGF\u2423R and NG2. Indeed, our previous studies of MHV-A59 lesions, similarly analyzed during early remyelination at 4 wpi, demonstrated increased local expression of PDGF\u2423R and NG2 as well as a dramatic increase of proliferating OPs detected by in vivo incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . In these lesioned tissues, PDGF ligand was up-regulated (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) but was not as markedly increased or as distinctly localized to the lesions as has been found in the present analysis of FGF2. PDGF and FGF2 acting in combination induce OPs from neonatal CNS to grow as a self-renewing line and induce OPs from adult CNS to display proliferative, migratory, and morphological characteristics similar to those of neonatal cells (B\u00f6gler et al., 1990; Wolswijk and Noble, 1992; Engel and Wolswijk, 1996) . Thus, in response to demyelination, local increases of FGF2 might also play a role in remyelination by enhancing OP responses to PDGF.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that oligodendrocyte lineage cells in normal and lesioned white matter express a repertoire of FGFRs. FGFR expression can be modulated by CNTF and FGF2 (Bansal et al., 1996; Bansal and Pfeiffer, 1997; Jiang et al., 1999) and, therefore, may be regulated by these and other cytokines and growth factors in the lesion environment. The functional results of FGF2 exposure can be diverse and may depend on the FGFR types expressed in conjunction with differential activation of intracellular signalling pathways within a given cell (Vaccarino et al., 1999) . In studies of normal CNS tissues, FGFR1 is expressed at relatively high levels by neurons (Asai et al., 1993; Yazaki et al., 1994; Gonzalez et al., \u0160 Fig. 8 . Expression of FGFR3 by multiple glial cell types. FGFR3 expression detected by immunofluorescence (A,C,D) or in situ hybridization (F,H). Immunofluorescence identification of oligodendrocyte progenitors with PDGF\u2423R (A) and anti-NG2 (E,G), mature oligodendrocytes with CC1 monoclonal antibody (B), and astrocytes with anti-GFAP (D). A: In sections of normal spinal cord, FGFR3 immunofluorescence (red) is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (example at arrow) with a characteristic small, elongated oligodendrocyte progenitor morphology that express PDGF\u2423R (blue). B,C: In sections of normal spinal cord, mature oligodendrocytes in the white matter that are immunolabeled with CC1 (B, green) are also immunolabeled with anti-FGFR3 (C, red channel of same field as B). D: In lesioned white matter (MHV, 4 wpi), anti-GFAP immunoreactivity increases consistent with gliosis and FGFR3 immunoreactivity (red) is intense in the astrocyte cell body and processes (double-immunolabeled cells appear yellow). E-H show cells isolated from MHV lesioned mice at 4 wpi, grown in culture for 2 days to allow process extension, and then labeled with anti-NG2 and detected with immunofluorescence (E,G), and in situ hybridization for FGFR3 mRNA detection with NBT/BCIP substrate (F,H). E,F: Cells with multiple processes that have not yet lost NG2 expression (E, red) exhibit perinuclear NBT/ BCIP reaction product for FGFR3 mRNA (F) that blocks the NG2 epifluorescence from the cell bodies (arrows indicate cell bodies). G,H: Bipolar cells immunolabeled for NG2 (G, red) consistently exhibited perinuclear FGFR3 mRNA signal (H). The ameboid cells (F,H) are microglia, which are abundant in cultures of lesioned spinal cord (Armstrong et al., 1990) . Microglia exhibit variable FGFR3 mRNA signal intensity. The ameboid cell in H shows only gray associated with phase-contrast imaging and serves as an indicator of a cell that is not labeled for FGFR3 mRNA. Scale bars \u03ed 50 m. 1995; Belluardo et al., 1997) . In contrast, FGFR2 expression is not detected in neurons but has been well characterized as being expressed in mature oligodendrocytes (Asai et al., 1993; Belluardo et al., 1997; Bansal et al., 1996) . However, oligodendrocytes and/or OPs have also been reported to express FGFR1 (Gonzalez et al., 1995; Bansal et al., 1996; Redwine et al., 1997; Jiang et al., 1999) . FGFR1 has been proposed to play a role in migration of neonatal OPs (Osterhout et al., 1997) and may modulate myelination by mature oligodendrocytes (Harari et al., 1997) . Our findings from remyelinating tissue support the possibility of a role for FGFR1 in some OPs, at a bipolar and thus potentially migratory stage, as well as in more differentiated cells.",

In vitro analysis has demonstrated that the IIIc variant of FGFR3 is associated with a late oligodendrocyte precursor stage as neonatal OPs differentiate (Bansal et al., 1996) . The FGFR3 splice variant IIIc can be activated by several FGF family members, including FGF2, whereas the IIIb isoform is preferentially activated by FGF1 (Ornitz et al., 1996) .

Attempts to use FGF2 null mice to determine the in vivo role of FGF2 in this remyelination model have not been possible because of morbidity of the MHV-A59 virus in this strain of mice (unpublished observation). Further analyses will be required to reveal positive, or possibly even negative, regulatory effects that may be mediated by FGF2, presumably interacting with specific FGFR splice variants and acting in combination with other factors. Detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular events that bring about successful remyelination in such model systems should facilitate the development of therapies for manipulating the cell populations and/or the lesion environment to promote repair in human demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis.",

A,B: In normal spinal cord white matter (PBS, 4 wpi), FGFR2 immunofluorescence was present (green in A) in the same cells that exhibited PLP mRNA (red in B; arrows indicate examples of double labeled oligodendrocytes). C: In normal spinal cord white matter (PBS, 4 wpi), astrocytes labeled with anti-GFAP (green) are not double immunolabeled for FGFR2 (red). D: In lesioned white matter (MHV, 4 wpi), anti-GFAP immunoreactivity (green) increases consistent with gliosis and FGFR2 immunoreactivity (red) is now found in cells that include astrocytes (double immunolabeled cells appear yellow).

A: In sections from normal spinal cord (PBS, 4 wpi) FGFR3 mRNA is detected in gray matter neurons (large cells, arrowhead) and in distributed small glial-like cells of the gray matter and white matter (arrows). B: In sections of lesioned spinal cord (MHV, 4 wpi), FGFR3 mRNA is expressed in both large neuronal cells (arrowhead) and small glial-like cells (arrows), with a marked increase in the density of labeled cells in the lesioned area of white matter (lesion associated with vacuolation; right side of field) relative to the nonlesioned white matter (left side; ventral to gray matter). C: A similar increase in the density of cells expressing FGFR3 within lesions is detected by immunofluorescence analysis of sections from lesioned spinal cord (MHV, 4 wpi). D: Higher magnification of FGFR3 immunofluorescence within a lesioned area of white matter shows variable intensities of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal. E: In sections prepared as in D, the immunoreactivity is abolished by incubation of the anti-FGFR3 antisera with the peptide antigen prior to immunostaining. F: Numerical density of cells expressing FGFR3 mRNA in spinal cord sections of mice injected with MHV-A59 (open bar) or PBS-injected control (hatched bar). Numerical density of cells in lesioned white matter that are expressing FGFR3 mRNA is significantly increased over that of a similar region of control white matter from matched PBS-injected mice (N \u03ed 3 MHV mice and 3 PBS mice; *P \u03fd 0.001, ANOVA).
