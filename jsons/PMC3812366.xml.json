            "text": "The seminal work by Benjamin and Gill, 1980a, Benjamin and Gill, 1980b showed that PARP1 activity is highly stimulated by the presence of DNA containing single- and double-strand breaks, a discovery that has been followed up by a succession of studies that linked pADPr metabolism to maintenance of genome stability (Meyer-Ficca et al., 2005). Mono- and poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation are reversible and phylogenetically ancient posttranslational protein modifications, for which the list of acceptor/target proteins is still expanding. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation can be achieved covalently or non-covalently (Fig. 1\nA). The covalent posttranslational modification (PTM) occurs on glutamic, aspartic or lysine residues, while non-covalent interactions between proteins and pADPr add another level for modulating proteins biological activity. This PTM has profound physico-chemical implications, as poly(ADP-ribose) bears two negatively charged phosphate groups per ADP-ribose (ADPr) residue, i.e. twice as many charges than DNA or RNA (Fig. 1A). The size and flexibility of pADPr polymers render them capable of mediating multiple contacts with protein surfaces, thus providing a significant enhancement in binding efficiency. Such physico-chemical attributes of the pADPr are capable of contributing to the creation of a scaffold for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Accumulating evidence indicates that pADPr actually conveys a broad spectrum of cellular signals through direct binding of a variety of protein motifs to pADPr, such as the DNA damage response, replication, chromatin structure, transcription, telomere homeostasis and cell death (Krishnakumar and Kraus, 2010).",

            "text": "The first experimental lines of evidence for proteins that bind pADPr in a non-covalent, yet specific, manner were given in the late 1960s and early 1970s when it was shown that histones possess high affinity for pADPr (Honjo et al., 1968, Nakazawa et al., 1968, Otake et al., 1969). However, whether the chemical nature of the bond was covalent or non-covalent was a highly debated topic (Adamietz et al., 1975). At that time, the prevailing view was that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was a covalent protein posttranslational modification on histones as is phosphorylation or methylation. This concept persisted for years until the 1980s when studies began to report interactions with PARP1-bound pADPr (Ohashi et al., 1983) and free pADPr (Sauermann and Wesierska-Gadek, 1986, Wesierska-Gadek and Sauermann, 1988). In the last decade, rapid progress has been achieved in the identification of pADPr-binding proteins among some of the chromatin-associated non-histone proteins and proteins involved in extranuclear signaling networks. Remarkably, more than four specialized pADPr-binding modules that recognize different structural features of the pADPr are responsible for the functional diversification of the pADPr-responsive cellular pathways. This paper first provides an inventory of the predominant techniques currently used to detect and measure non-covalent protein\u2013pADPr interactions, then turns to an in-depth description of the specialized pADPr-binding modules that recognize different structural features of the pADPr, and finally, presents the functional consequences of this association in pADPr-responsive cellular pathways.",

Proteins of interest are either hand-spotted, vacuum-aspirated or separated on a polyacrylamide gel prior to being transferred and renatured onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The interaction with pADPr is subsequently revealed by incubating the membrane with purified label-free pADPr, [32P]-radiolabeled pADPr or biotin-labeled pADPr. Bound pADPr is detected with anti-pADPr antibodies, by autoradiographic exposure or streptavidin conjugates, respectively. This technique is also used with peptide arrays to map the pADPr-binding regions of a protein. In this assay, peptides are chemically synthesized to represent the sequence of putative pADPr-binding sites, such as those predicted in silico based on consensus motifs (e.g. PBM, see Section 3.1). EMSA was developed to characterize pADPr\u2013protein non-covalent interactions in solution (Fahrer et al., 2007). Incubations are made in the presence of pADPr and increasing concentrations of a purified protein. Protein-pADPr complexes are subsequently resolved by gel electrophoresis. Free and bound pADPr are detected using a streptavidin conjugate. A shift in the mobility of the protein indicates the formation of a protein\u2013ligand complex. Since all measurements are made at equilibrium, the binding affinities can be calculated using a sigmoidal dose\u2013response curve.",

In this method, a solution that contains a ligand is titrated into a solution of its binding partner until saturation is reached. A complete thermodynamic profile of the molecular interaction as well as the binding affinity (K\nD) are calculated from the heat released or absorbed over time during the interaction. SPR measures in real-time the refractive index changes near a sensor surface. A ligand (such as biotinylated pADPr) is immobilized on the surface of a solid support (chip) and the analyte (protein of interest) is passed over the surface to make contacts with the ligand. Interactions induce a change in the refractive index proportional to the mass on the surface. The data are fitted to a kinetic model to calculate the rate of association (ka), the rate of dissociation (kd) and the binding affinity (K\nD\n = kd/ka).",

We showed that restrictions to specific amino acid types exist for positions within the PBM (Fig. 2B). The previously reported preference for hydrophobic residues [ACGVILMFYW] was recovered, but there was a clear tendency for limited residue types to be allowed (mostly aliphatic residues), especially at position \u22121, +1 and +2 relative to the central K/R doublet (Fig. 2B). Clearly, the PBM refers to the conservation of a physical property pattern rather than a fixed sequence motif. The refined motif offers a more stringent definition of the original motif that decreases the probability of a PBM arising by chance in a protein database search. Computational PBM prediction has proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of protein regions that could mediate interaction with pADPr. They have been shown to convey important functions in animal models. Notably, the PBM discovered in the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is critical for the ability of AIF to induce cell death by parthanatos (PARP1-dependent cell death) in cells and in vivo (Wang et al., 2011). A detailed PBM-pADPr complex has yet to be modeled but a study of the structural features of AIF\u2019s PBM showed that it occupies an area on the surface of the protein which could provide stabilizing non-covalent contacts of amino acid side chains with pADPr (Wang et al., 2011). We can only speculate as to whether all PBMs possess common structural features, but a highly exposed solvent-accessible surface must be present to make contacts with pADPr molecules. Based on the helix propensity scale, positively charged amino acids (K/R) have a tendency to form \u03b1-helices (Pace and Scholtz, 1998). Since PBMs are located in lysine- and arginine-rich regions, it would be likely to find several of them in a helical conformation.",

            "text": "Remarkably, PBMs are present in a marked number of proteins involved in the response to DNA damage and other chromatin transactions such as chromatin structure, replication and transcription (Table 1). Furthermore, the PBM often overlaps with important regulatory protein domains (Pleschke et al., 2000). This has triggered the idea that upon binding to pADPr, the PBM could shield a regulatory surface by steric hindrance, thus destabilizing several protein\u2013protein or protein\u2013ligand interactions. Alternatively, a highly extended and flexible polymer bound to a protein domain could distort it so that perturbations of the native fold may arise. Globally, molecular crowding by the pADPr provides the basis for the concept of \u201creprogrammation\u201d of protein functions as suggested (Malanga and Althaus, 2005). Actually, the affinity of several DNA damage response factors for pADPr can modulate (I) the sensing of DNA lesions; (II) the dynamic chromatin remodeling events and (III) the assembly and functionality of DNA repair complexes. We believe that the transient accumulation of pADPr following DNA-dependent PARP activation can result in vast pleiotropic effects on a systems-wide scale that implicates numerous DNA damage response effectors. This is supported by the predominant presence of nucleic acid-interacting proteins in the PBM\u2019s prediction datasets (Gagne et al., 2008). Indeed, DNA- and RNA-binding modules are significantly over-represented as putative pADPr-binding modules and thus represent a general class of pADPr-targeted proteins with potential for broad implication in the DNA damage response. However, in some proteins, the PBM is distinct from the nucleic acid binding domains, such as in AIF, providing the ability of pADPr to modulate protein function in the context of nucleic acid binding. Generally, proteins associate in multi-protein complex machineries that execute biological processes that a single protein cannot execute alone. Macromolecules that disrupt or stabilize such complexes drive a wide variety of cellular processes. pADPr possesses the biochemical and structural properties to fulfill such functions through non-covalent interactions.",

The GAR domain of MRE11 is required for its DNA binding activity (Boisvert et al., 2005, Dery et al., 2008) but also mediates its interaction with pADPr as well as its rapid accumulation at DNA strand breaks (Haince et al., 2008). The MRE11 exonuclease activity is inhibited by pADPr in vitro, suggesting that pADPr may regulate MRE11-dependent end-resection at DSBs or at stalled replication forks, as recently reported (Ying et al., 2012). Interestingly, several other GAR-containing proteins participate in the DNA damage response and genome surveillance. In view of the high pADPr level that transiently accumulates at sites of damage, it is suspected that the function of some of these GAR-bearing proteins might be regulated by pADPr. 53BP1 regulates repair of DSBs, while the nuclear DNA helicase II (RNA Helicase A) interacts and regulates the DSBs biomarker \u03b3-H2AX (Mischo et al., 2005) and the Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) (Friedemann et al., 2005). The nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex comprises several core components with affinity for pADPr. Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) has a GAR motif, while CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4) and MTA1 (metastasis associated 1) interact with pADPr through a still undefined motif (Chou et al., 2010, Lai and Wade, 2011, Polo et al., 2010). The latter two proteins are involved in the recruitment of the NuRD complex to DNA strand breaks in a pADPr-dependent manner (Lai and Wade, 2011). Our current understanding suggests that the presence of pADPr acts as a recruitment module for the organization of the PARP1-associated DNA repair and chromatin remodeling machinery at DNA lesions. On the other hand, pADPr binding to the GAR domain could be considered as a DNA displacement mechanism required to reconfigure the DNA repair protein complexes and provide access to damaged DNA. It may also interfere with other DNA damage-induced posttranslational modifications, such as PRMT1-dependent arginine methylation in the GAR domain (Bedford and Richard, 2005). This view supports a concept where pADPr is a key orchestrator of the DNA damage response.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been suggested that pADPr regulates post-transcriptional gene regulation in the cytoplasm, notably through the assembly of cytoplasmic stress granules (Leung et al., 2012). In support of this, we showed that the stress granule effector G3BP1 binds pADPr by its GAR domain (Isabelle et al., 2012). Importantly, G3BP1-mediated stress granule assembly is impaired by PARP inhibition during genotoxic insult, suggesting that pADPr is critical for the reprogrammation of messenger ribonucleoparticles in cellular stress responses. This result adds to the experimental evidence that the pADPr-binding protein AIF functions as a negative regulator of stress granules (Cande et al., 2004). These results emphasize the fact that pADPr can perform various functions in several different DNA damage-processing pathways and can enable a crosstalk between the regulation of the early and late steps of the DNA damage response.",

            "text": "The RNA recognition motif (RRM), also referred to as RNA-binding domain (RBD) or ribonucleoprotein domain (RNP), is the most abundant nucleic acid-binding motif in the human genome (Clery et al., 2008). RRMs are found in a wide variety of RNA and ssDNA-binding proteins. RRMs may be found in conjunction with GAR-containing proteins. One prominent example is hnRNP A1 that possesses two RRMs in addition to its GAR motif. hnRNPs are highly versatile proteins that can participate in various aspects of nucleic acid metabolism: mRNA stability and splicing, DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, telomere maintenance, DNA repair and genome stability (Han et al., 2010). Based on a proteome-wide screen to identify pADPr-binding proteins, our laboratory was the first to identify hnRNPs as a family of proteins with affinity for pADPr (Gagne et al., 2003). More recently, Ji and Tulin (2009) validated this finding by providing evidence that hrp38 (the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of human hnRNP A1) binds pADPr in a non-covalent way in vivo, with the consequence of reduced RNA-binding ability. RNA processing factors (such as NONO and RBMX) recently emerged as guardians of genomic stability with widespread involvement in preventing DNA damage (Adamson et al., 2012, Krietsch et al., 2012, Paulsen et al., 2009). Both NONO (Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) and RBMX (RNA-binding motif protein, X chromosome) comprise RRMs and are recruited in a pADPr-dependent manner to DNA damage (Adamson et al., 2012, Krietsch et al., 2012). We have recently reported the binding of pADPr to the RRM1 domain of NONO. As it was observed for hnRNPA1, pADPr interfered with the interaction of NONO with RNA in vitro. Notably, the binding of NONO to pADPr by RRM1 is crucial for the recruitment of NONO to DNA damage sites and influences the outcome of DNA DSB repair. The high binding affinity of pADPr to NONO was assessed by SPR (Table 2). Similar to DEK and XPA described above, NONO showed a strong affinity for non-fractionated and long pADPr chains while no binding was detected for short pADPr chains. These observations therefore provide further support for RRMs as biologically relevant pADPr-binding modules (Krietsch et al., 2012). Given the frequent occurrence of RRM-containing proteins in the human proteome, interactions with pADPr are likely to have a significant impact on cell signaling through a complex network of biochemical pathways.",

It has been shown that the SR protein ASF/SF2 binds pADPr with high affinity (Malanga et al., 2008). Two domains in ASF/SF2 can mediate the interaction with pADPr: (I) a N-terminal fragment that contains a RRM1 and (II) a C-terminal SR domain (Malanga et al., 2008). Given that the SR domain carries an excess positive charge with the predominance of arginine residues, this pADPr-binding feature resembles that of the GAR which also harbors a basic arginine-rich cluster expected to interact with the phosphate backbone of pADPr. Similarly, strong pADPr-binding was observed in lysine- and arginine-rich (K/R-rich) motifs located in the nucleosome remodeler dMi-2 (Murawska et al., 2011). It remains to be determined whether the presence of a basic electrostatic patch on a protein surface could be considered as a general pADPr-protein interface or if additional structural determinants are required (such as the helical conformation of the SR domain (Sellis et al., 2012)).",

PBZ domains have been observed only in eukaryotic proteins, excluding yeast. The absence of PBZ motifs in prokaryote and yeast proteins parallels the absence of pADPr metabolism in those, suggesting a co-evolution of the PBZ motif with the presence of PARPs. Only three human proteins appear to carry a PBZ motif: the aprataxin and PNK-like factor (APLF, also called XIP1, PALF), the checkpoint protein with FHA and RING domains (CHFR), and the DNA cross-link repair 1A protein (DCLRE1A/SNM1A) (Fig. 3\n) (Ahel et al., 2008). Interestingly, the PBZ module was found in some non-human proteins involved in the maintenance of genome integrity or DNA repair: Ku70, Rad17, Parp and Chk2 in Dictyostelium discoideum and DNA Ligase in Caenorhabditis elegans corresponding to human DNA Ligase III.

Structural studies of the PBZ domains with small molecules that mimic the features of pADPr have revealed that besides the cysteines and histidines coordinating the Zn ion, critical aromatic residues mediate interactions with the adenine ring of ADPr (Ahel et al., 2008, Eustermann et al., 2010, Isogai et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010, Oberoi et al., 2010). The lack of conservation of most of these critical binding residues in the PBZ sequence of DCLRE1A suggests that it may not bind pADPr, but this has not been experimentally assessed (Oberoi et al., 2010). The affinity of CHFR (5 \u00d7 10\u221210\n M) and APLF (9.5 \u00d7 10\u221210\n M) for pADPr measured by SPR indicates that this module has the highest affinity for pADPr of all pADPr-binding domains (Table 2). Interestingly, the affinity of APLF for pADPr is in the same range than that of CHFR, despite the fact that it has two PBZ. Each PBZ of APLF binds independently pADPr, but with reduced affinity relative to the tandem PBZ and the full length protein (Table 2) (Ahel et al., 2008, Eustermann et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010, Rulten et al., 2008). Moreover, the affinity of PBZ1 for pADPr is 10-fold higher than that of PBZ2 (Table 2) (Eustermann et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010). These observations are in line with the structural details of CHFR and APLF, which strongly suggested that the CHFR PBZ and the PBZ1 domain of APLF are able to interact with two consecutive ADPr moieties in pADPr while the second PBZ of APLF probably binds only one (Oberoi et al., 2010). These observations are also consistent with the more deleterious effects of mutations in PBZ1 than in PBZ2 for the recruitment of APLF to UV-induced DNA strand breaks (Li et al., 2010, Rulten et al., 2008). PBZ1 may also interact with PARP1 as well, providing further affinity of PBZ1 for automodified PARP1 (Eustermann et al., 2010, Macrae et al., 2008).",

APLF comprises a N-terminal FHA domain and displays apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activities in vitro. APLF is rapidly recruited to DNA strand breaks introduced by UV irradiation via both its FHA and PBZ domains. While the FHA domain mediates interactions with the repair proteins XRCC1 and XRCC4, the tandem PBZ domain directs pADPr-dependent recruitment of APLF to DNA strand breaks, where APLF facilitates NHEJ. Both PARP1 and PARP3-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation have been shown to promote APLF responses to DNA strand breaks (Rulten et al., 2008, Rulten et al., 2011).",

This function of CHFR is dependent on its interaction with PARP1 and pADPr, because mutations in the CHFR PBZ that disrupts pADPr-binding as well as PARP inhibitors both abolish the CHFR-dependent mitotic checkpoint (Ahel et al., 2008, Kashima et al., 2012, Oberoi et al., 2010). Recently, a mechanistic interplay behind CHFR and pADPr interactions inducing a mitotic entry delay was uncovered (Kashima et al., 2012). The activation of PARP1 following mitotic stress promotes the pADPr-dependent ubiquitylation of PARP1 by CHFR and its proteasomal degradation (Fig. 4A). This finding further revealed that PARP1 levels must be critically controlled during cell proliferation.",

First identified in the distantly PARG-related bacterial protein DUF2263, this finding was then confirmed with the structural analysis of a protozoan PARG and rat PARG (Dunstan et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2012a, Slade et al., 2011). Therefore, despite minimal sequence similarity between the typical macro domain and PARG, part of the PARG catalytic domain adopts this characteristic macro fold organization in which the PARG sequence signature GGG-X6-8-QEE lines the ADP-ribose binding pocket. However, in the mammalian PARG, additional essential sequences extending beyond the macro domain adopt structural conformations around the macro fold that specify the catalytic pocket and the glycohydrolase activity. Importantly, a unique \u201ctyrosine clasp\u201d near the catalytic pocket offers an explanation for the exoglycosidic and endoglycosidic activities of mammalian PARG towards pADPr (Brochu et al., 1994), the latter endoglycosidic activity lacking in the bacterial PARG (Kim et al., 2012a). These recent findings have thus highlighted that some macro domains may only be revealed once the 3D structure is determined, indicating that there may be other pADPr-binding macro proteins in mammalian cells awaiting identification.",

This molecule is produced by the sirtuin deacetylases, which uses NAD+ as a co-factor to deacetylate proteins. The three stand-alone macro domain proteins, namely macroD1, macroD2, and C6orf130, appear to form a subgroup of macro domain proteins showing this deacetylase activity by cleaving the ester bond between the acetyl group and ADPr. One could envision that some macro domain proteins possessing O-acetyl-ADPr deacetylase activity may be able to hydrolyze the protein-ADPr ester bond (Fig. 1B). Until now, the ability of PARG and ARH3 to fulfill this function has been questioned. The existence of a distinct enzyme (an ADP-ribose lyase) able to hydrolyze the ester bond between the glutamic or aspartic acid residue of the acceptor protein and ADPr has been proposed nearly 30 years ago (Oka et al., 1984), but remains to be characterized. However, the recent indications that lysines could also constitute ADPr acceptor sites on PARP1 and histones, forming a ketamine in this case (Fig. 1B) (Altmeyer et al., 2009, Messner et al., 2010), suggest that there may be more than one \u201clyase\u201d.",

Macrohistones and CHD1L contribute to the structure of chromatin (see Sections 4.4, 4.5) and regulatory transcriptional functions have been ascribed to PARP9, PARP14, macroD1 and macroH2A variants. The latter macrohistones have been generally linked to transcriptional repression as they induce a more condensed chromatin state and impede access to transcription factors, although in some specific cases they can also promote transcription (reviewed by (Gamble and Kraus, 2010)) (Muthurajan et al., 2011). PARP9 was also shown to repress transcription via its macro domains (Aguiar et al., 2005). In contrast, PARP14, also named CoaSt6 because of its co-activator function for the transcription factor Stat6, promotes interleukin-4 dependent gene activation in a manner dependent on its macrodomains as well on its mono-ADP-ribosyl-transferase activity (Goenka and Boothby, 2006, Goenka et al., 2007). MacroD1, originally named leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16), was identified as a co-activator of androgen and estrogen receptor transcriptional activity as well as of NF-\u03baB (Han et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2009). This transcriptional co-activation of macroD1 is dependent on its macro domain. Collectively, these examples suggest that pADPr-macro domain interactions contribute to transcriptional regulation.",

The structural characteristics of the Iduna/RNF146 WWE domain and its interaction with pADPr were thoroughly investigated by polymer blot assays, NMR and crystallography (Andrabi et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012). Iso-ADPr rather than ADPr is the smallest unit that can be bound by the Iduna/RNF146 domain (Fig. 1B). The lack of interaction between WWE and ADPr was explained by the need for phosphate groups on either side of the adenine-ribose structure to make extensive contacts with the binding pocket. This supported the idea that the WWE domain is a pADPr-binding module because at least two ADPr units are needed to generate the iso-ADPr ligand. The proposed structure is compatible with interactions with iso-ADPr within longer pADPr chains (Wang et al., 2012), consistent with the co-purification of Iduna/RNF146 with pADPr (Andrabi et al., 2011). Four residues have been identified as crucial for iso-ADPr-binding in the Iduna/RNF146 WWE domain. These residues are well conserved throughout most human WWE domains (Wang et al., 2012), including the putative or demonstrated ubiquitin ligases Deltex 1,2,4, HUWE1 and TRIP12, which have been shown by SPR to also bind pADPr (Table 2). The WWE domains of several PARP family members (PARP11, PARP13 and the first WWE of PARP12) also comprise the conserved residues, suggesting that they bind pADPr. Only the binding of PARP11 has been examined, and showed interactions with ADPr and pADPr with rather low affinity (Table 2) (He et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012). In contrast, two of the residues are not conserved in the second WWE of PARP12, in TiPARP, PARP14 and the putative phospholipase DDHD2, suggesting that these may not bind pADPr, as shown for DDHD2 (DDHD domain containing 2) in in vitro binding experiments (Wang et al., 2012).",

This link was uncovered in the regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by tankyrases and Iduna/RNF146 (Huang et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2011). This pathway, essential for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, is tightly regulated by the concentration of axin. It turns out that axin is a substrate for tankyrase such that its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation allows its recognition by Iduna/RNF146. Binding of Iduna/RNF146 to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated axin triggers axin ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, we concurrently showed that Iduna/RNF146 plays a prominent role in the context of DNA damage through its pADPr-dependent E3 ligase activity as it also ubiquitylates several DNA repair factors in a way that depends on pADPr. PARP1/2, KU70, XRCC1 and DNA ligase III were identified as Iduna/RNF146 substrates when poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP1 (see Section 4.2 and Fig. 4B and E) (Kang et al., 2011).",

The N-terminus of these proteins contains tandem WWE motifs mediating interactions with the ankyrin repeats of Notch intracellular domain.

HUWE1 participates in the DNA damage response by tightly regulating steady state levels of XRCC1, DNA polymerase \u03b2, and DNA ligase III (Khoronenkova and Dianov, 2011, Parsons et al., 2009). Several substrates of HUWE1 for ubiquitylation/proteosomal degradation have been identified: Cdc6, the c-Myc oncogene, histones, as well as p53 (Adhikary et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2005, Hall et al., 2007). TRIP12 is a key regulator of the DNA damage response (Gudjonsson et al., 2012) by acting as a guard against excessive spreading of ubiquitylated chromatin at DNA damage sites as it functionally suppresses RNF168, another E3 ligase, which promotes the concerted accumulation of H2A and H2AX at DNA damage site. The importance of pADPr-binding by the WWE motif of HUWE1 and TRIP12 for their recruitment to DNA strand breaks remains to be addressed.",

Of these, PARP13 has been examined as an antiviral protein (also named zinc antiviral protein ZAP). PARP13 inhibits the replication of viruses by recruiting the cellular RNA degradation machineries to degrade the viral mRNAs.

            "text": "The mechanistic link between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and the regulation of protein degradation is one of the most surprising aspects of the recent advances on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Three research groups identified independently the E3-ligase Iduna/RNF146 as being a key regulator of protein stability in a pADPr-dependent manner (Andrabi et al., 2011, Callow et al., 2011, Kang et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2011). Remarkably, this pathway appears to function in several biological contexts, regulated not only by PARP1 but also by the tankyrases 1 and 2 (Fig. 4\nA). In the context of DNA damage, PARP1 automodification triggers its ubiquitylation by Iduna/RNF146 and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (Kang et al., 2011). In the context of Wnt signaling, it is tankyrase-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of axin that induces its Iduna/RNF146-dependent proteasomal degradation and subsequent \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription (Callow et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2011). Iduna/RNF146 binds to pADPr of varying lengths (Andrabi et al., 2011) and ubiquitylates substrates poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated with short chains as occurs with tankyrases (Zhang et al., 2011) and substrates poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated with long chains that occurs with PARP1 (Kang et al., 2011). Thus Iduna/RNF146\u2019s dynamic range of protein quality control in the setting of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may be extensive. Because of this, there are likely to be multiple checkpoints that control Iduna/RNF146\u2019s activity and biological actions that require further investigation. Interestingly, regulation of protein stability in a pADPr-dependent manner is not restricted to WWE-containing E3-ligases because the PBZ-bearing CHFR E3-ligase has been shown recently to ubiquitylate PARP1 to target it for proteasomal degradation in the context of mitotic stress (see Section 3.3; Fig. 4A) (Kashima et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The clinical importance of the tankyrase-Iduna/RNF146-dependent regulation of protein stability was revealed recently in studies focusing on the cherubism-mutated protein 3BP2 (Guettler et al., 2011, Levaot et al., 2011). Cherubism is a rare autosomal dominant human disorder characterized by inflammatory destructive bone lesions resulting in abnormal fibrous tissue growth in the lower part of the face. Approximately 80% of all cherubism patients carry a mutation in the Sh3bp2 gene, which encodes the Src homology 3 domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2). Interestingly, most of these mutations lie within a six amino acid sequence (RSPPDG) that corresponds to the tankyrase substrate-recognition motif (Levaot et al., 2011). Upon successful binding of tankyrase 2 to the latter motif in 3BP2 of healthy cells, 3BP2 is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated, which serves as a signal for its Iduna/RNF146-directed ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 4A) (Guettler et al., 2011, Levaot et al., 2011). The regulated degradation of 3BP2 is profoundly disturbed in cherubism patients because the interaction and hence poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of mutated 3BP2 by tankyrase 2 is impaired, abolishing 3BP2 ubiquitylation by Iduna/RNF146. The abnormal accumulation of 3BP2 within cells appears to alter the signaling balance of SRC kinase multiprotein complex to which it is associated, causing systematic inflammation, and leading to the cherubism phenotype (Guettler et al., 2011, Levaot et al., 2011). Hence, understanding the concerted action of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and ubiquitylation might improve therapeutic approaches targeting cherubism.",

            "text": "Massive activation of PARP1 following a genotoxic stress has been long recognized as a critical event in the induction of cell death. However, it is only in recent years that pADPr has been recognized as a death signaling molecule after the identification of pADPr as the trigger of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)-dependent cell death. This insight came from studies attempting to determine the linkage between PARP1 activation during genotoxic stress and translocation of AIF from the mitochondria to the nucleus (Yu et al., 2002). Experiments to determine the mechanism of how PARP1 activation was intimately coupled to AIF translocation led to the discovery that pADPr translocates from the nucleus to mitochondria where it acts as an AIF releasing factor to cause the mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of AIF, initiating cell death (Fig. 4B) (Andrabi et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2006). This type of cell death, called parthanatos, occurs in neuronal cells following excitotoxicity as well as other cell types in which DNA damage is induced by specific genotoxic agents (Fig. 4B) (Wang et al., 2009). As noted above, the PBM within AIF is required for the release of AIF after PARP1 activation (Wang et al., 2011). It is important to note that the pADPr binding site in AIF is distinct from its DNA binding site. Thus, agents could be designed to block this interaction serving as inhibitors of parthanatos or to enhance the release of AIF for cancer chemotherapeutics. In a screen for cell survival factors, we identified the E3-ligase Iduna/RNF146 as a pADPr-dependent pro-survival factor, triggered by the same pADPr signal, in this case during non-toxic neuronal stress (Fig. 4B) (Andrabi et al., 2011). Iduna/RNF146 protects against parthanatos (pADPr-dependent) cell death mediated by glutamate excitotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo and against middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke. Iduna/RNF146\u2019s protective properties are due to its ability to bind pADPr, consistent with the notion that pADPr can act as a death signal during parthanatos. PARG also inhibits parthanatos via degradation of the pADPr (Koh et al., 2004), whereas Iduna/RNF146 interferes with pADPr death signaling. Together both PARG and Iduna/RNF146 function as inhibitors of parthanatos during genotoxic stress providing endogenous controllers of cell death initiated by activation of PARP1.",

These structures are composed of cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled pre-initiation mRNA complexes. In addition to a subset of ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors, the SG contains a variety of RNA-binding proteins that promote its nucleation and participate in the reprogrammation of translation during stress. The localization of several PARPs in SG (PARP12, PARP13, PARP14, PARP15 and tankyrase, called here SG-PARPs) uncovered a connection between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. It has been shown that the overexpression of the SG-PARPs promotes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of mRNA-associated proteins and the assembly of SGs, while PARG overexpression inhibits their appearance supporting a key role for pADPr in the assembly of SG (Fig. 4C). This notion was further supported by the identification of G3BP1, one of the primary nucleator of SGs (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007), as a pADPr-binding protein (Isabelle et al., 2012). In contrast to the cytoplasm-restricted poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions of the SG-PARPs, the G3BP1-associated SG are assembled with a pADPr-dependent mechanism that originates from the nuclear activation of PARP1/2. These two possibilities are schematized in Fig. 4C.",

Another mechanism has arisen from studies of the non-covalent interaction of ALC1/CHD1L with pADPr. PARP1 activation not only recruits this protein to sites of DNA damage, it also stimulates its ATPase activity and induces CHD1L-dependent nucleosome repositioning (Fig. 4D) (Ahel et al., 2009, Gottschalk et al., 2009). This PARP-dependent function of CHD1L may be of importance during DNA damage signaling and repair of DNA strand breaks, as well as of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers by nucleotide excision repair (Fig. 4E) (Luijsterburg et al., 2012, Pines et al., 2012).",

This concept is now being extended to other DNA repair factors, including mutations in ATM, p53 and the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex (Oplustilova et al., 2012, Williamson et al., 2012). Interestingly, the exact mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors is still a matter of ongoing debate (Helleday, 2011, Patel et al., 2011). Large-scale sequencing projects of human genomes, such as the ENCODE project consortium, may help to reveal novel sequence variants or mutations in proteins involved in the maintenance of genomic stability with critical implications in the development of human cancers (Dunham et al., 2012). It is also reasonable to think that a critical mutation in a pADPr-binding motif might have deleterious consequences in signaling pathways that comprise the DNA damage response.

Similarly intriguing is the sensitivity of cancers and cells bearing gene fusions with ETS transcription factors (mainly ERG), including prostate cancer and Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, to PARP inhibitors (Brenner et al., 2011, Brenner et al., 2012, Garnett et al., 2012).

Based on the latter findings and on the fact that PARP inhibitors have minimal side-effects, they have been in clinical trials for almost a decade, either in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, as a single-agent or very recently in combination with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, that further expand the treatment options for cancer patients (Ibrahim et al., 2012, Javle and Curtin, 2011, Juvekar et al., 2012, Rouleau et al., 2010).",

Although sufficient to ensure binding to pADPr, these pADPr-binding domains vary widely in their degree of ligand specificity. While some seems to have a general affinity for the polyanionic backbone of biomolecules (i.e. DNA, RNA and pADPr) due to the presence of basic patches of amino acid residues, others evolved to perform specialized functions and exhibit a high degree of target specificity towards pADPr. Currently, the PBZ domain, which forms a divergent C2H2-type zinc finger fold with specialized functions, possesses the highest affinity for pADPr. The C2H2 zinc finger fold is amongst the most prevalent protein motifs in the human proteome and comprises the largest family of regulatory proteins in mammals. With this knowledge, we can speculate that uncharacterized variations in finger-like protrusions might provide the specificity required to recognize different pADPr structures.",

Because the PBM represents a short contiguous protein segment, examination of other context criteria, such as protein surface accessibility, evolutionary conservation as well as the determination of three-dimensional PBM-bound pADPr complexes will help to establish the local structural environment required for pADPr-binding.

Still, the mechanisms underlying the relocalization of pADPr to the cytoplasm after specific stresses are largely unknown. The physiological aspects of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are only starting to emerge as they are more difficult to grasp. pADPr levels often fall below the threshold of detectability using current methods, especially in the cytoplasm. The triggers of pADPr synthesis by the damage-independent PARPs, such as tankyrases and SG-PARPs, are undefined. Nonetheless, in view of their important functional outcomes in regulating protein stability and posttranslational gene expression in the cytoplasm, no doubt that it must be finely regulated. Considering the critical functions of Iduna/RNF146 in directing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins towards proteasomal degradation, and the high catabolic activity of PARG, it is conceivable that some functional aspects of pADPr-binding proteins may consist in protecting pADPr from degradation, or in shielding the pADPr from Iduna/RNF146/CHFR to protect target proteins from degradation. We can also wonder whether there may be pADPr-dependent deubiquitylases that further regulate this process. It is now important to critically examine the regulation of pADPr degradation by PARG, ARH3 and possibly some macro domain proteins, in cellular contexts where pADPr-binding proteins also operate, to truly understand the extent of signaling afforded by pADPr. Some pathways appear to rely on the generation of free pADPr molecules, requiring an endoglycosidic activity that so far, only PARG is known to display. Our understanding of these fundamental questions now depends on the development of sensitive and quantitative methods for the detection of nuclear and cytoplasmic pADPr structures.",

(A) The posttranslational modification of a protein substrate by enzymatic covalent attachment of poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) to specific amino acid side chains is represented. On the pADPr structure, a collection of modular protein domains non-covalently binds to pADPr through different recognition mechanisms. There are currently four pADPr-binding protein modules that have been experimentally characterized: the pADPr-binding motif (PBM); pADPr-binding zinc finger motif (PBZ); the macro domain (Macro) and the WWE domain (WWE). Experimental evidence suggests that other protein modules and sequence motifs can read this modification (see Section 3). (B) Detailed view of the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The proximal ADP-ribose (ADPr) is bound by an ester linkage to glutamic (Glu) and aspartic (Asp) amino acid side chains (the asterisk indicates one or two CH2 units to represent the respective side chains of Asp or Glu) or to lysine (Lys) side chains via a ketamine linkage. The mechanism that determines selective modification of specific residues and the functional significance of this heterogeneity are not known. Additional ADP-ribose units are subsequently attached by O-glycosidic linkages to form linear or branched pADPr. Some components of the pADPr chemical structure recognized by pADPr-binding modules are shown: iso-ADPr, grey shadow, ADPr, yellow shadow.",

(A) The first PBM has been described by Pleschke and collaborators (2000) in a variety of DNA damage repair and checkpoint proteins. The motif is primarily composed of a hydrophobic and basic amino acid core flanked by a cluster of positively charged residues [\u2026K/R\u2026]. Each box represents one amino acid position. (B) A refinement of the motif was proposed by Gagne et al. (2008) based on a number of PBM variations found in human proteins. The refined pADPr-binding signature confirmed the overall basic nature of the PBM but represents a minimal stand-alone version of the motif, the K/R-rich N-terminal cluster being dispensable for efficient binding. Outside the dual [KR][KR] site, there are additional preferences for hydrophobic amino acids (positions \u22121, +1 and +2), mostly those with alkyl side chains. The basic [KR][KR] doublet is an important requirement for the PBM since most substitutions in this region result in a substantially reduced binding affinity for pADPr.",

            "text": "Fig. 4: Schematic models of pADPr regulatory functions. (A) Protein stability can be regulated via pADPr-directed recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Some protein substrates of tankyrases (TNKS1/2) (3BP2 and axin) or automodified PARP1 undergo proteasomal degradation after ubiquitylation by the WWE-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase Iduna/RNF146 or by the PBZ-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase CHFR (see Sections 3.3, 4.1 for details). (B) Neuronal cell fate after toxic stress. The excitation of glutamate receptor by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) triggers PARP activation. Non-toxic NMDA activation (left panel) induces the expression of the cell survival factor Iduna/RNF146 and its cytoplasmic accumulation. Interactions of Iduna/RNF146 with pADPr prevent apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) translocation to the nucleus and parthanatos. Excitotoxic activation of glutamate receptors (right panel) fail to induce Iduna/RNF146 expression. The accumulation of cytoplasmic pADPr promotes the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria. AIF subsequently translocates to the nucleus and induces parthanatos. See Sections 3.5, 4.2 for details. (C) pADPr-dependent assembly of stress granules. Two models have been proposed (see Section 4.3 for details). In the first view, cytoplasmic ADPr and pADPr are synthesized by tankyrases and PARP12-15 upon stress exposure. This triggers the aggregation of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) to ADPr/pADPr and stress granule formation. In the second view, the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of pADPr is responsible for its accumulation into the cytoplasm. By virtue of its endoglycosidic activity, PARG releases free and protein-bound pADPr following genotoxic stress and PARP activation. pADPr translocated into the cytoplasm is targeted by G3BP1 and RNA-binding proteins to initiate the aggregation of stress granules. In both views, pADPr in ribonucleoparticles acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of RNA-binding proteins. (D) pADPr plays regulatory roles in the dynamics of chromatin structure. Automodification of PARP1 and poly(ADP-ribosy)ation of histones induce chromatin relaxation. This also involves the chromatin remodeling factor CHD1L, which is recruited to specific sites by pADPr. The ATPase activity of CHD1L is stimulated by pADPr and triggers nucleosome sliding. This possibly facilitates access of the DNA repair machineries. (E) Functions of pADPr in DNA damage responses. DNA strand breaks as well as other types of altered DNA structures and DNA adducts activate PARP1. pADPr triggers the recruitment of proteins and enzymes involved in DNA damage signaling, in base excision repair (BER), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR) and nucleotide excision repair (NER).
