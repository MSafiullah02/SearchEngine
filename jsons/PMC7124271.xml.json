Data collected included person and time distributions of cases during the initial cluster between April and June 1997, and new cases after that, up to June 2000. Case history, physical examination, laboratory tests, pathology examination, and exposure history were also recorded. Patients were identified by reviewing hospital records. Exposure history was obtained by interviewing the patients. Twenty-nine of the 31 patients operated on were from one hospital, from which clinical and laboratory data were obtained for the study; the other 2 patients, who were operated on but whose clinical and laboratory data were not obtained, were not hospitalized at the collaborating hospital. Routine blood tests were performed before surgery for all patients. All histologic slides from the appendectomies were reexamined in the Department of Pathology and World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas. The pathologic examination in the paper was approved by the patients and by the Scientific Section, Medical school, Wuhan University, which is a designated review board.",

Two normal controls were selected for each case. One control was selected from an adjacent seat in the classroom of the patient, and the other was selected randomly from the same dormitory room as the patient. The matching variables included sex and age. A questionnaire consisted of two parts: (1) clinical history: presence or absence of a cold before the onset of symptoms, stomach disease, typhus fever, dysentery, ascariasis, and schistosomiasis; and (2) exposure factors: presence or absence of unclean or spoiled food intake before the onset of symptoms, type of food intake, dinner party, washing hands before meals, ingestion of water not boiled. To probe why the incidence rate was higher among female students, we also collected gynecologic and menstrual history of the female patients. The female patients were divided into three groups according to the phase of menstrual cycle in which they presented with appendicitis: the menstrual group (day 1 to 5 after the onset of the period), the follicular group (day 6 to 14 after the onset), and the luteal group (day 15 to 28 after the onset). To correct for the different lengths of each phase, the incidence of disease was calculated by dividing the number of instances in each phase by the length of days.",

That was followed by incubating the section with 1.5% normal goat serum at room temperature for 30 minutes to block nonspecific secondary antibody binding. A heating antigen retrieval step was used by immersing the sections in (10% target retrieval solution; Dako, Carpinteria, California), at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The monoclonal mouse antienterovirus clone 5-D8/1 and monoclonal antiadenvirus group, described above and diluted 1:100, was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes for each section respectively.

All students and 81 staff used the same water source and dining hall. About 50 students who were from the city lived at home. During September 1997 to June 2000, 618 students (321 male and 297 female) were enrolled. Students lived in a seven-story dormitory building with seven rooms on each floor. The building was partitioned by wall on each floor with one side having four rooms (for female students) and another side having three bedrooms (for male students).

Martin and Gustafson [19] described a cluster in a town of 8,000 people in the United States. Thirteen cases of appendicitis occurred during a 3-month period. A case-control study of these patients indicated that sweets in the diet and consumption of local farm eggs may have been associated with the appendicitis. They hypothesized that a group of young male patients who were susceptible to appendicitis because of the high sugar content of their diets were exposed to a bacterium or virus that precipitated this cluster of appendicitis. About the cluster, the Centers for Disease Control [21] published an editorial note that the cluster of appendicitis offered a unique opportunity to identify possible risk factors and to search for precipitating infectious agents. The CDC encouraged reporting such clusters to the Enteric Disease Branch, Center for Infectious Diseases. Andersson et al [20] described \u201cthree outbreaks\u201d that occurred in a city of Sweden during a 22-year period. On three occasions, a significantly increased number of cases were observed in 60 days, as compared with expected cases, with a range of 1.6 to 2.2. That did not represent a typical cluster. The incidence rates in this city were lower than those Martin reported. Our study reports an incidence rate more than 10 times higher than those reported in the above two reports.",

            "text": "Published studies have indicated that the expected incidence rate of appendicitis is about 1.5 cases per 1,000 persons [15], [22]. It is generally accepted that appendicitis is a sporadic, noncommunicable disease process more frequently found in males than females. The majority of the patients have elevated WBC and differential WBC. Pathologic examinations usually reveal purulent inflammation with neutrophils. In this study, the control patients had the above features of classic acute appendicitis, whereas the patients from the high school cluster exhibited an obviously different pattern. On the basis of the epidemiologic and pathologic features, we hypothesize that the patients from the high school had a special kind of appendicitis, which might have been caused by an infectious agent. Our reasons are as follows: (1) the occurrence of outbreak and clustering are usually characteristics of infectious diseases, and classic appendicitis does not occur in this pattern; (2) female patients were more common than male patients, in contrast to classic appendicitis in which males predominate; (3) many patients had a history of mutual contact before the onset of symptoms, suggesting person-to-person transmission; (4) with the exception of 4 cases, all of the postcluster patients were students enrolled right after the cluster; (5) only a minority of the patients had mildly elevated WBC or differential WBC; and (6) gross pathologic examination of the appendices revealed only minimal purulent change, and microscopic examination revealed hemorrhagic features mainly with infiltration and exudation of lymphocytes as well as infiltration of eosinophiles. In addition, the average lag time between onset of symptoms and surgical intervention was more than twice that of control patients. Therefore, the unique features of the patients from the high school cluster are not early manifestations of classic acute appendicitis; instead, they seem to represent a special kind of appendicitis process. The absence of parasite eggs in the students' appendices and the negative history of intestinal parasites excluded parasitic infection. Tobe [7] reported that Coxsackie virus B2 and B5 and adenovirus type 7 were demonstrated in appendiceal tissues of the cases with appendicitis. We were not able to find positive results using monoclonal mouse antienterovirus clone 5-D8/1 and monoclonal antiadenovirus group.",
