One advantage of this approach\nis that it allows us to study the difference between local information and global\ninformation.4 Besides these\nprevalence-based information, we also consider one kind of belief-based information4 which is related to individual nodes\u2019 contact\nnumbers called contact information. This accounts for awareness of a higher risk when a node\npossesses a larger contact number.

All\nthree forms of awareness can reduce susceptibility to infection. Theoretical analysis and\ncomputational simulations indicate that both the contact awareness and the local awareness\ncan raise the epidemic threshold to control epidemic outbreak, while the global awareness\nonly decrease the epidemic prevalence. Hence, even in the absence of immunization procedures\nor quarantine/isolation measures, an epidemic disease can be controlled by human adaptive\nreactions.7,9 These results accord\nwith previous findings.5,9",

We consider the averaged infection fraction in the nearest\nneighborhood (NN) of node i with degree k at the steady\nstate, denoted by \u03c1knm(\u221e). In Fig. 8, the relation between \u03c1knm(\u221e) and k is\nnumerically investigated. This plot clearly illustrates the obvious difference from\n\u03c1knm(\u221e) with respect to k,\nand further tells us that \u03f1i\nas a function of node i is not uniform. Consequently, for all nodes in a\npopulation, the global information is homogenous but the local information is heterogenous\n(this is similar to the effect of contact awareness23). The heterogeneity of information leads to the heterogeneity of\nindividual awareness. This further leads to the heterogeneity of the infection rate owing to\nthe definition (1).
