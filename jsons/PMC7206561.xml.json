They included books written by several nonmedical authors setting the study\u2019s context, as well as autobiographies written by medical and nonmedical authors providing a firsthand account of physicians\u2019 lived journeys. These two types of literature served to establish a preliminary understanding of the patients\u2019 trajectories from the onset of the infection to the patients\u2019 death. They also provided an account of physicians\u2019 journeys from the onset of the infection to their patients\u2019 death and beyond, including attending their funerals, for example, at different key periods of the pandemic\u2019s trajectory. These key periods were identified as follows: Period 1, HIV/AIDS Emergence; Period 2, Recognized Pandemic and Militancy Rise; and Period 3, HIV Chronicity and Militancy Decrease (see appendix\u2014HIV-AIDS Pandemic Trajectory: Three Periods). A few examples of the books and autobiographies from nonmedical and medical authors are highlighted here for their significant input into the study.",

They discuss medical and psychological challenges faced by both physicians and patients from the initial HIV/AIDS diagnosis up to and including the end-stage of the disease, and the dying process. They also describe specific skills and strategies that physicians can use to meet these challenges and discuss the role that friends, family, and professional counselors play in addressing the ongoing challenges of living with HIV/AIDS. In Reports From the Holocaust: The Story of an AIDS Activist, Kramer (1994) shares his views as an AIDS activist and advocate, as well as on AIDS and LGBT civil rights from the beginning of the pandemic. In addition, he documents his time spent working in community organizations against HIV/AIDS (e.g., Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis and ACT UP) and beyond. As for Shilts (1988), in his book titled And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic, he discusses the discovery and spread of HIV/AIDS and comments on the government\u2019s indifference and political infighting during the early 1980s.",

In My Own Country: A Doctor\u2019s Story of a Town and Its People in the Age of AIDS, Verghese (1985) tells a story of the AIDS epidemic inside a hospital in rural America while confronting his own prejudices and fears. In Strong Shadows: Scenes From an Inner City AIDS Clinic, Zuger (1995) presents stories of HIV/AIDS patients she attempted to treat by illustrating their struggles with infections and medications, as well as the effects on them and their families. As for the book titled AIDS Doctors: Voices From the Epidemic. An Oral History, authors Bayer and Oppenheimer (2000) recount the stories of 73 physicians whose lives were centered on the HIV/AIDS pandemic (see also Boulanger & Thomas, 2008; Cyr, 2001; McCoy, 2005; Olivier, 1996; Scannell, 1999; Selwyn, 1998).",

Physicians highlighted the impact of the emergence of HIV/AIDS, their recognition of the epidemic and the pandemic on them, their patients, and their profession. They mentioned, among other themes, the uncertainties generated by a multiplication of scientific and medical discoveries/findings, as well as the developments in the treatment of opportunistic infections related to the HIV infection. Physicians also talked about the perceptions they and other physicians held about sexuality, drug use, and HIV/AIDS. Finally, they disclosed how they modified the way they practiced medicine at the outset of their careers, moving from a physician-centered practice toward a more patient-centered practice.",

They mainly sought out physicians who could and were willing to provide information by virtue of their expertise and competence in sexually and blood-transmitted infections and in the HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment field. They looked for those who were involved and had experience, since the beginning of the pandemic, in the treatment of patients, and who had the reputation of having been confronted by the devastating effects of the pandemic throughout its trajectory by the HIV/AIDS research community. Moreover, they sought out physicians with the same sexual preference as theirs and identified as being gay, as well as individuals who possessed a militancy background, that is to say, mobilized and advocated for their patients and their community. Finally, patients migrated toward locations where these specific physicians had established their practice in large Canadian urban centers, mainly in private and public health clinics specialized in the treatment of patients with sexually and blood-transmitted infections, and in the HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment field.",

After the standard procedures for qualitative studies, that is, explanation of the study, interview procedure, and consent form, the second phase of study began, that is, data collection through interviews. Interviews were conducted either at the physician\u2019s workplace (e.g., office) or in a room on the university campus. They were to last roughly 1 hr. However, the physicians\u2019 generosity would not be dampened by a time constraint! The interviews were conducted using an interview grid, that is, closed-ended questions for quantitative information gathering (e.g., age, number of years of experience, number of HIV/AIDS patients, and work environment) and open-ended questions for qualitative information gathering about the physicians\u2019 lived journeys. Besides being audio-taped, a researcher journal was maintained to capture the researcher\u2019s impressions and perceptions following each interview. The study used the period that included the start of the epidemic (around 1981) through to the said infection chronicity (around 1998), as well as up to the interview period, 2008-2009.",

Waddell used his book to transmit to his daughter, and to the world, his vast knowledge, using his extraordinary ability to teach and translate knowledge. Waddell explains the full chronology of the progression of the infection and his attempts to cure/heal it. He also gives explicit examples of his lifestyle before and during the epidemic, up until his death.
