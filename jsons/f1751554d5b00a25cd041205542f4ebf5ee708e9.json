All strains caused colds in volunteers, and those cultivable in tissue culture (TC) produced significantly more coryza and less sore throat than strains growing only in organ culture (OC). The TC strains were serologically related to 229E, but these isolates produced colds with a frequency and severity that contrasted with the effects of 229E itself. Tests on volunteers' preinfection sera showed that the prevalence of antibody to 229E had increased during the period 1961-1979 and that during 1977-1979 only 11 % of subjects had no neutralising antibody against 229E. Susceptibility to the 229E-related isolates PR and TO was associated with low preinfection serum neutralising antibody against the homologous virus, and paired sera frequently showed fourfold or greater antibody rises, most commonly against the homologous strain. Volunteers infected with TO were immune when reinoculated with the same strain approximately 1 year later, but other similar volunteers were at least partly susceptible to infection with a heterologous 229E-related virus after similar time intervals. Although the strains of HCV that were grown in tissue culture were all related to the prototype 229E, they appeared not to be identical with it, and this heterogeneity is probably a significant factor in the epidemiology of HCV infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "meida and Tyrrell [ 19671 and McIntosh et a1 [ 19671.

The effects of 229E in volunteers were described by Bradburne et al [1967] .

Two TC strains, PR and TO, produced moderately high mean scores, and virus was reisolated directly in tissue culture from nasal washings of the majority of subjects given those strains. Paired sera from about half the volunteers given PR or TO showed fourfold rises in neutralising antibody titre against the homologous virus.

Eight other subjects developed mild or moderate cold symptoms and shed virus after an inoculation of 229E, LP, KI, TO, or DP and were each reinoculated 8 to 14 months later with a heterologous, 229E-related TC strain, either LP, KI, TO, or DP. In contrast to the immunity found after homologous reinoculation, five of the eight subjects receiving a heterologous strain on the second occasion developed cold symptoms (mean clinical score 10.5) and five shed virus. Similarly, four other volunteers who developed colds after inoculation of the OC strain PA, which is related to 229E by ELISA (Macnaughton, 1981b) , were challenged 11-13 months later with the TC strain KI. Two of the four subjects developed colds after challenge (mean clinical score 12.8) and three shed virus. Although the number of observations on heterologous challenge is small and the possible effects of natural intercurrent infections cannot be documented, these results suggest that infection with a 229E group virus confers only partial immunity against subsequent infection with another 229E-related strain, whereas full immunity to homologous reinfection lasts at least a year.

Thus, there are clearly at least two major serogroups of HCV. The antigenic complexity of OC43-related strains is already well documented: McIntosh [I9741 studied a number of OC isolates and concluded that they were variably related to each other, to OC43, to MHV, and perhaps to 2298. All TC strains so far examined are related to 229E and have been thought to form a relatively homogenous group, but few of them have been studied in detail, although Bradburne [1970] noted minor differences between 229E and strain LP.

Monto [ 19741 suggested that 229E virus becomes prevalent in the community every 2 to 3 year, and with this hypothesis of 2-to 3-year \"cycling\" of 229E in mind, our inability between 1972 and 1978 to obtain more than very few minor infections with 229E virus in volunteers seemed surprising, but it became clear that most subjects had preinoculation neutralising antibody to 229E, and that the prevalence of this antibody had apparently steadily increased between 1961 and 1979. The new isolates all produced colds in volunteers, although some strains appeared more pathogenic than others. For the TC strains, increased pathogenicity or virulence for volunteers was associated with low preinoculation neutralising antibody titres against the homologous virus, but for the OC strains it was not possible to establish whether the strain-specific immune status of the recipients was a reason for the apparent variations in strain virulence. Rechallenge experiments in volunteers suggested that the various 229E-related strains were only partly cross-protective, although immunity to reinoculation of the same strain lasted at least a year. Thus, the present results suggest that the existence of serological variants of HCV probably has an important bearing on the frequency and severity of infections in the individual and in the community.

Both the neutralisation and the ELISA test show the relationship of 229E to other TC strains, but although microneutralisation appeared less sensitive than ELISA [Kraaijeveld et al, 19801 and gave very low titres with volunteers' sera, it nevertheless showed differences between 229E and the other TC strains that were not revealed by ELISA and that appeared to correspond with their clinical effects. The neutralisation test may, therefore, detect both 229E group-specific and subtypespecific components; and modifications of this technique, such as the kmetic neutral-isation test [Bradburne, 19701 or neutralisation in organ culture [Darbyshire et al, 19791 , although cumbersome, might help in differentiating strains. Although the general biochemical structure of coronaviruses is now becoming clearly established [Siddell et al, 19821, it is not yet known how many antigenic determinants are associated with the surface polypeptides of HCV nor to what extent the polypeptides of different HCV strains vary. Studies with monoclonal antibodies against HCV have not yet been reported but may prove rewarding in defining the antigenic diversity of the strains. Similarly, genome analysis aided by the use of restriction enzymes may also help to establish the inter-relationships of these viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 345, "text": "[Macnaughton et al, 1981al", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 510, "end": 535, "text": "[Kraaijeveld et al, 19801", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 931, "end": 948, "text": "[Bradburne, 19701", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 984, "end": 1008, "text": "[Darbyshire et al, 19791", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1192, "text": "[Siddell et al, 19821, it", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "The morphology of three previously uncharacteriscd human respiratory viruses that grow in organ culture", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Almeida", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Daj", "middle": [], "last": "Tyrrell", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1967, "venue": "The Journal of General Virology", "volume": "1", "issn": "", "pages": "175--178", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Chemoprophylaxis and Virus Infections of the Respiratory Tract", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Beare", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Reed", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1977, "venue": "", "volume": "2", "issn": "", "pages": "27--55", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Antigenic relationships amongst coronaviruses.
