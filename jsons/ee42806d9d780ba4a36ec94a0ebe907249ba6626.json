Because COVID-19 patients are treated by physicians less 84 familiar with the implications of QT prolongation and exacerbating factors such as other QT prolonging medications and electrolyte abnormalities, our protocol included active 86 involvement of the ECG readers and the electrophysiology team. 87 Local hospital stakeholders created an SBAR (Situation Background Assessment 88 Recommendation Tool) (Figure 1) with guidelines for QT monitoring which was 89 disseminated to the teams caring for these patients. This SBAR tried to balance risk and 90 the desire to limit frequent ECGs in patients with COVID-19 and was largely based on 91 experience with QT prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs. It did utilize QT measurements 92 from telemetry when possible, but 12 lead ECGs were used for those not on units with 93 telemetry, a large proportion of the COVID-19 patients at our hospital. We then 94 identified all ECGs from patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, or originating from 95 floors designated as COVID-19 units Our screening was designed to capture as many 96 COVID-19 patients as possible and thus a small percentage (15.4%) of screened 97 patients, often in intensive care units with other medical emergencies, were COVID-19 98 negative. These ECGs were placed at the beginning of the reading queue for the 99 electrophysiologist or cardiologist over reading the ECGs on that day. The daily reader 100 identified all ECGs with significant QT prolongation as outlined in the SBAR (QTc > 470 101 ms for QRS < 120 ms or QTc > 500 ms for QRS > 120 ms) (Figure 1), and notified the 102 electrophysiology consult service, who then reviewed the charts of these patients and 103 provided telephone, and if necessary, formal inpatient support to the primary team 104 caring for the patients. This support consisted most often of recommendations to replete 105 electrolytes to more stringent levels (Potassium >4 mmol/L; Magnesium >2 mg/dL) electrophysiology team, and to consider the risks and benefits of continuing COVID-19 109 targeted therapy, most commonly with hydroxychloroquine. 110 Continuous variables are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD and categorical data as number 111 (percentage).
