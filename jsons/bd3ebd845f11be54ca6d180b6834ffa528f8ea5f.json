            "text": "This paper addresses the new problem of automated screening of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on chest X-rays, which is urgently demanded toward fast stopping the pandemic. However, robust and accurate screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL), which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation. Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy people. Extensive experiments on the three-class classification show that our algorithm remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. It achieves an accuracy of 97.01%, a precision of 97%, a sensitivity of 97.09%, and an F1-score of 96.98%. These results endow our algorithm as an efficient tool for the fast large-scale screening of COVID-19.",

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 to date, more than 5,083,278 people have been infected around the world. And more than 329,668 deaths from the virus have been recorded according to the World Health Organization. Fast and large-scale screening is necessary to cut off the source of infection. However, the rapidly growing amount of COVID-19 cases makes global medical resources unbearable. Automated screening systems can correspondingly assist in speeding up screening and would reduce the workload of radiologists. Therefore, it is urgent to realize the automated screening of COVID-19 that helps to accelerate the large-scale screening and alleviate the global shortage of medical resources.",

Clinically, although nucleic acid detection is the gold standard, the availability, stability, and reproducibility of nucleic acid detection kits are problematic [47] . For example, the quantity of nucleic acid kits is limited in many countries or regions, resulting in the slower screening of new coronary pneumonia [54] . Many patients with new coronary pneumonia cannot be tested in time and thus cannot be admitted to the hospital, which accelerates the widespread of the novel virus. On the contrary, medical imaging examinations can help clinical to carry out disease detection conveniently and quickly, and thus make patients be treated timely. Accordingly, medical imaging examinations with symptom observation are widely used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 worldwide [25] .",

On the one hand, regular X-ray machines can be accessed in most primary hospitals where CT scanners are insufficient. Most ambulatory care facilities have deployed X-ray units as basic diagnostic imaging. Most importantly, the easily accessible X-ray examination is beneficial for fast large-scale screening. On the other hand, the radiation dose of X-ray is a few hundredths of the chest CT [12, 22] . One statistic from the San Francisco bay area shows that hospitals add one more case of cancer for every 400 to 2,000 additional routine chest CT examinations [42] . This statistic indicates that a single chest CT examination increases the lifetime risk of cancer by 0.05% -0.25%. Also, the X-ray examination is more economical than CT.",

The second bottleneck is that the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is very high. High misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 has a prohibitive cost that is not only delaying the timely treatment of patients but also causing the widespread of the virus with high social costs. Misdiagnosis cost sensitivity should be fully considered in the automated screening of COVID-19. Therefore, these limitations impedes the accurate screening of COVID-19 patients from the susceptible population.",

DCSL combines both advances from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning techniques. To overcome the subtle difference bottleneck, we propose a conditional center loss function to learn the discriminative representation between fine-grained classes. By combing with vanilla loss function, the conditional center loss can discover a weighted center for each class and efficiently enlarge the inter-class manifold distance as well as enhancing the intra-class compactness in deep representation space. To combat the cost sensitivity, we propose scorelevel cost-sensitive learning. It introduces a score-level cost matrix to reshape the classifier confidences by modifying the classifier output, such that the COVID-19 examples have the maximum score, and the other classes have a substantially lower score. Based on the domain knowledge that the costs between misclassifying COVID-19 into different classes or misclassifying other classes into COVID-19 are not equal, we define new score-level costs to encourage the correct classification of COVID-19 class. We combine both advances into a deep neural network with end-to-end optimization, successfully achieving fine-grained cost-sensitive screening of COVID-19. A series of experiments show that our algo-rithm remarkably outperforms previous methods.",

Among them, automated screening received the most attention, involving chest X-ray based and chest CT based works. Since 3D CT scans have spatial complexity, existing CT based works have proposed to design three types of solutions, including patchbased methods [47, 51, 39, 24] , slice-based methods [41, 15, 16, 23] , and 3D CT-based method [56] . As we mentioned before, CT has some disadvantages of expensive, high radiation, and inaccessibility, thus lots of screening works are based on 2D chest X-rays.",

Wang et al. [47] proposed a new deep network called COVID-Net, which consists of stacked residual blocks for achieving easily training and deepening the architectures. To improve diagnostic performance, Ghosha et al. [14] used Bayesian convolutional neural networks to estimate uncertainty. More interestingly, Zhang et al. [54] viewed this screening task as an anomaly detection problem and proposed to use existing anomaly detection techniques. Specifically, they used a hybrid loss that combines a binary cross-entropy loss and a deviation loss to assign anomaly scores to COVID-19 examples. While a few pioneering works have made great progress, they neglect both cost sensitivity and fine-grained bottlenecks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that we insightfully view the screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays as a fine-grained cost-sensitive classification problem.",

The facing problem of fine-grained classification is that these subordinate categories naturally exist small inter-class variations and large intra-class variations. The common solutions of this problem can be organized into three main paradigms, including 1) localization-classification networks based methods [55, 29, 48] , 2) external information-based methods [43, 50, 8] , and 3) end-to-end feature coding-based methods [30, 10] . Localization-classification networks based methods first learn part-based detectors or segmentation model to localize salient parts for improving the final recognition accuracy. However, this type of paradigm needs additional part annotations. External information-based methods leverage exter-nal information, i.e., web data [43] , multi-modality [50] , or human-computer interactions [8] .",

For instance, the contrastive loss is designed for dealing with the relationship of paired example points effectively [44] . Triplet loss correspondingly constructs loss functions for example triplet [35] . However, contrastive loss and triplet loss are required that the number of training pairs or triplets dramatically grows, with slow convergence and instability. Center loss is proposed to solve this issue by minimizing the deep feature distances of intra-class only [49] . This loss function learns a center for each class and pulls the deep features of the same class to their centers efficiently. However, center loss easily suffers from the issue of class imbalance.

In the classical machine learning setting, the costs of classification errors of different classes are equal. Unfortunately, the costs are not equal in many real-world tasks. For example, in COVID-19 screening, the cost of erroneously diagnosing a COVID-19 patient to be healthy may be much higher than that of mistakenly diagnosing a COVID-19 patient to be common pneumonia. Costsensitive learning is proposed to handle this problem and has attracted much attention from the machine learning and data mining communities [57] . Existing works on misclassification costs can be categorized into two classes, including example-dependent cost [52, 53, 4] and class-dependent cost [5, 9, 32] . Example-dependent cost-based methods consider the misclassification cost of each example and are required example-level annotations, which are impractical in real-world tasks. Therefore, most methods are focused on class-dependent costs. Cost-sensitive learning is also suitable to handle the problem of class imbalance [28] . In this study, we introduce a score-level cost-sensitive learning approach based on an expert-provided cost matrix to improve the screening accuracy of COVID-19 from chest X-rays.",

There are 13 convolutional layers with a small filter with a size of 3 \u00d7 3 for extracting deep features. Five max-pooling layers with 2 \u00d7 2 kernel are deployed after each block of the convolutional layers. We set the output shape of the features of the last convolutional layer to be 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 512 and flatten them. The original fully connected layers of VGG16 are removed and replaced by two trainable fully-connected layers. The channel numbers of the two fully-connected layers are 256 and three, respectively. Since the collected dataset is too small to obtain promising results through training the deep network from scratch, we use a transfer learning strategy, i.e., the parameters of the convolutional layers are initialized from the pre-trained model 3 on ImageNet [7] . Also, all the compared algorithms are implemented according to their open-source codes with pretraining. The chest X-ray images were resized into 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3. We also use an augmentation strategy to expand the dataset: each random-selected example is rotated by 15 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. The is set as 0.05. is set to one without loss of generality. Adam optimizer is used with an initial learning rate of 1e-3. We set the training epoch to 40. The score-level cost matrix is designed according to the clinical expert experience as following. First of all, the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 is higher than misclassifying other classes. Among them, the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 into healthy patients is higher than the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 into other pneumonia patients. Second, the cost of misclassifying other pneumonia is smaller than the cost of misclassifying COVID-19. Specifically, the cost of misclassifying other pneumonia into COVID-19 is higher than the cost of misclassifying other pneumonia into healthy patients. Third, the cost of misclassification of healthy people is smaller than in the previous two situations. Among them, the cost of misclassifying a healthy person into COVID-19 is greater than the cost of misclassifying a healthy person into other pneumonia. Accordingly, the final score-level cost matrix is designed as illustrated in Figure 3 . ",

They show that DCSL has higher accuracy with stable convergence. Table 2 reports the results of out ablation study on different loss functions. Our conditional center loss (Softmax Loss + CCL) remarkably outperforms the center loss and softmax loss. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the class-conditional information when updating the center points and optimizing the center loss. can contribute to improving the intra-class compactness. Moreover, Figure 6 shows that the conditional center loss has fewer mistakes and achieves a balance performance on the three classes. Also, Both Figure 8 and Figure 9 show that the conditional center loss has excellent stability and fast convergence. In summary, the conditional center loss has a significant impact on the performance of our proposed architecture. When the conditional center loss is not used, the result of classification is obviously decreased, and the learned deep features contain significant intra-class variations.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that formulates this novel application as a fine-grained cost-sensitive classification problem. Extensive results have demonstrated that DCSL can achieve reliable and accurate results. Indepth analyses have revealed the effectiveness and potential of DCSL as a clinical tool to relieve radiologists from laborious workloads, such that contribute to the quickly large-scale screening of COVID-19.",
