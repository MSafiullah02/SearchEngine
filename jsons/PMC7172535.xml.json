            "text": "Much of the recent research on nosocomial infections has dealt with the need for new antibiotics, better antibiotic management and better diagnostic techniques to detect infections earlier. Better drug treatment and earlier infection diagnosis can certainly play a major role in reducing morbidity and mortality from hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). However, there are many non-pharmacological interventions that can significantly reduce the incidence of HAIs, but these are often overlooked in practice. This review is not exhaustive and will not attempt mathematical data analysis but will examine recent research that examines non-pharmacological interventions for reducing HAIs. It will also include a brief description of the morbidity, mortality and medical costs associated with nosocomial infections, along with a brief discussion of the routes by which HAIs spread.",

It was previously believed that most pathogenic bacteria could not survive as bioaerosols and spread significant distances to infect patients. However, many airborne pathogenic bacteria are viable but not culturable, and some experts have estimated that as little as 1% of viable bacteria are culturable by standard microbiological techniques.11, 12 For example, Heidelberg et al. reported that viable counts of Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella planticola and Cytophaga allerginae in 4-hour-old bioaerosols were, respectively, 48, 73 and 66% of the original counts even though none of the bacteria was culturable on tryptic soy agar plates.12 Many pathogens present on sneezes evaporate in less than a second into small droplet nuclei of about 2 \u03bcm diameter.13, 14 Such small droplet nuclei can remain suspended for hours and travel long distances before settling.14\n",

A review of eight studies calculated that mean rates of bacterial infections in haemodialysis patients were about 6.3/1000 days when temporary catheters were used, 2.8/1000 days with cuffed temporary catheters, 0.4/1000 days with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, and 0.14/1000 days when arteriovenous fistulas are used.118 Renal patients are at significant risk for hepatitis C (HCV) transmission from haemodialysis procedures. Risk of HCV transmission can be significantly reduced by using separate haemodialysis machines and equipment for HCV+ and HCV\u2212 patients, proper gloving and other barrier precautions by healthcare workers, proper cleaning of machines and sending all tubing and dialysis units for either disposal or disinfection and reprocessing after each use.119 A Spanish study reported that HCV+ prevalence fell from 30.5% (121 patients) in 1993 to 6.8% (161 patients) (P\n < 0.05) in 2003 following the institution of universal precautions and increased cleaning along with the separation of HCV+ and HCV\u2212 patients.

Higher rates of surgical infections are associated with operations of two or more hours, a contaminated or dirty procedure, or inadequate scrubbing procedures.123 Traditionally patients have been shaved at surgical sites, but it is now believed that clipping hair is better since shaving leaves small cuts in the skin. A review of three trials involving 3193 surgical patients reported that there were significantly more surgical site infections when patients were shaved versus clipped (RR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.21\u20133.36).124 Cleaning surgical sites with antiseptics such as iodine compounds or chlorhexidine has long been recommended to reduce risk of surgical infection. However, meta-analysis of six studies found that bathing or swabbing sites with 4% chlorhexidine solutions was associated with only a marginal decline in surgical site infection rates compared with bathing with plain soap or placebo solutions (RR: 91%; 95% CI: 0.80\u20131.04).125\n",

All rooms housing TB patients should have at least 12 outdoor ACH, have a negative pressure of at least 0.01 inch water, and the rooms of patients with actual or suspected TB should be checked visually with tests such as smoke tests. HEPA air filters in patient rooms and UV irradiation in the ventilation systems or upper part of rooms is also strongly recommended to reduce airborne TB levels.
