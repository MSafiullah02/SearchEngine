Alternatively, he recommends sterilization of the N95 masks by hanging them in the oven (without contacting metal) at 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F) for 30 minutes, as it is reported that COVID-19 cannot survive at 65\u00b0C (149\u00b0F) for 30 minutes.15,16 Dr Tsai does not recommend use of ultraviolet light or sunlight, as these might degrade the material and the elastic bands.",
