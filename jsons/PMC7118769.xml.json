Delays and scheduling conflicts initially created by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (March 2002) as well as difficulties in coordinating operations, patient consent, and blood acquisition explain why a lengthier enrollment period was necessary. The surgeons were blinded to the patients' group randomization, whereas perfusion, anesthesia, and cardiac critical care unit (CCCU) staff were unblinded. Institutional research ethics board approval was granted at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with written informed consent obtained from the legal guardian of each patient before enrollment into the study randomization. An independent safety committee oversaw the study with no member having any clinical responsibilities for any of the study subjects and no ties to any of the study investigators. Sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria of being less than 1 month of age and scheduled for elective cardiac surgery requiring CPB. Exclusion criteria included emergency surgery and patients known to have a pre-existing coagulopathy. Subjects were randomized in blocks of 4 to 6 patients to receive either RFWB in the prime of the CPB circuit and for all transfusion requirements up to 24 hours postoperatively in the treatment group (n = 31) or standard blood component therapy in the control group (n = 33). Required sample size was calculated on the basis of previous study of fresh whole blood versus component therapy.13 It was calculated that a sample size of 50 patients would detect a 50% reduction in chest tube volume loss with alpha of.05 and power of 90%.",

To account for repeated measures and multiple comparisons, differences between groups for serial measures of laboratory and inflammatory marker variables were tested in multivariable mixed linear regression modeling using a compound symmetry covariance structure. The compound symmetry covariance structure calculates and accounts for the correlation between multiple observations on the same patients. Multivariable regression models were created using maximum likelihood estimates to determine the independent effect of age of blood cells in the prime, allogeneic donor exposures, and platelet count on medical outcome of interest while accounting for correlation between these variables. Given a skewed distribution for the inflammatory marker variables, the distribution was normalized with a logarithmic transformation.

Because the effect of RFWB is likely multifactorial in nature, further analyses were performed to quantify the relative effect of each component. In univariate analysis, chest tube loss at 24 hours in CCCU, inotropic score at 24 hours, duration of ventilation, and hospital stay were all found to be significantly associated with age of blood product given in the prime and throughout CPB, exposure to allogeneic donors, and platelet count at the end of bypass. In multivariable analysis (Table 5\n), lower platelet count at the end of bypass, older age of blood product given in the prime and throughout CPB, and exposure to higher number of allogeneic donors were found to be independent predictors of higher chest tube loss at 24 hours and longer duration of ventilation. Only lower platelet count at the end of bypass and exposure to higher number of allogeneic donors were independent predictors of higher inotropic score at 24 hours. Lower platelet count at the end of bypass and older age of blood cells given in the prime and throughout bypass were found to be independent predictors of longer duration of hospital stay. Of interest, the relationship observed between platelet counts at the end of CPB and clinical outcomes is replicated by platelet counts at 10 minutes during CPB.",

A few major issues with the study design are to be considered when contrasting both studies. First, the use of fresh whole blood for priming the bypass circuit only while using component therapy for further transfusion requirements might have obscured the effect of fresh whole blood. Second, the use of blood (in both arms of the study) that had not been leukodepleted could offset gains made by using fresh whole blood. Finally, morbidity and mortality rates in the postoperative period might have confounded the results and overshadowed any improvements made with the use of fresh whole blood. Furthermore, another study by Manno and colleagues13 also found that the use of fresh whole blood for priming and for perioperative and postoperative requirements was associated with improved clinical outcomes, thus supporting the results of the current study.",

Nonetheless, many features of a fresh reconstituted whole blood strategy show that they are independently associated with improved outcomes: fresher blood, smaller number of exposures, and higher platelet count during bypass. Many of these features can be obtained with this modified component therapy protocol even when single donor whole blood is unavailable. As such, when single donor RFWB is not practical, an alternative strategy may include the use of reconstituted fresh components from multiple donors. This may replicate the effect of RFWB without the challenge of obtaining single donor products. The addition of fresh platelets in the prime will achieve a higher platelet count on initiation of bypass and throughout surgery, which was found to be an important element of the effect of RFWB. Because this assumption is not yet supported by research, future studies could focus on methodologies to emulate the effect of RFWB using different techniques when RFWB is not available.",

Further, the age of red cells and platelets in the component therapy group was older than that used in other centers but was within acceptable CBS standard operating procedures. The assessment of blood loss in the postoperative period only took into account drainage from chest tubes and did not account for potential blood collecting in the pleural cavity or blood accumulating in the mediastinum for patients with open chests in the intensive care unit. Despite the fact that using chest tube volume loss as a surrogate for postoperative bleeding could underestimate total blood loss, there are no reasons to believe that this difference would be unevenly distributed between experimental groups.
