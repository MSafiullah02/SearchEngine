            "text": "In this work we provide updated constraints on coupled dark energy (CDE) cosmology with Peebles-Ratra (PR) potential and constant coupling strength \u03b2. This modified gravity scenario introduces a fifth force between dark matter particles, mediated by a scalar field that plays the role of dark energy. The mass of the dark matter particles does not remain constant, but changes with time as a function of the scalar field. Here we focus on the phenomenological behavior of the model, and assess its ability to describe updated cosmological data sets that include the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, polarization and lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations, the Pantheon compilation of supernovae of Type Ia, data on H(z) from cosmic chronometers, and redshift-space distortions. We also study which is the impact of the local measurement of H0 from SH0ES and the strong-lensing time delay data from the H0LICOW collaboration on the parameter that controls the strength of the interaction in the dark sector. We find a peak corresponding to a coupling \u03b2 > 0 and to a potential parameter \u03b1 > 0, more or less evident depending on the data set combination. We show separately the impact of each data set and remark that it is especially CMB lensing the one data set that shifts the peak the most towards \u039bCDM. When a model selection criterion based on the full Bayesian evidence is applied, however, \u039bCDM is still preferred in all cases, due to the additional parameters introduced in the CDE model.",

            "text": "Important observational hints in favor of the positive acceleration of the Universe appeared already more than twenty years ago, thanks to the detection of standardizable high-redshift supernovae of Type Ia (SNIa) and the measurement of their light-curves and redshifts [1, 2] . Since then, many other probes have contributed to increase the evidence in favor of the late-time accelerated phase. They range e.g. from the detection of the baryon acoustic peak in the two-point correlation function of matter density fluctuations [3, 4] to the very accurate measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies by WMAP [5] and Planck [6] [7] [8] . At the phenomenological level, the easiest explanation for such acceleration is given by the presence of a very tiny cosmological constant in Einstein's field equations, with an associated energy density which is orders of magnitude lower than the quantum field theoretical estimates made for the vacuum energy density. Protecting such low value from radiative corrections is extremely difficult and constitutes the core of the so-called \"old\" cosmological constant problem, cf. e.g. [9] [10] [11] . In addition, explaining why the current value of this energy density is of the same order of magnitude as the matter energy density, the so-called \"coincidence problem\", is considered by part of the cosmological community as * gomez-valent@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de \u2020 valeria.pettorino@cea.fr \u2021 l.amendola@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de another problem that needs to be addressed. The cosmological constant is a pivotal ingredient of the standard cosmological model, also known as \u039bCDM or concordance model (cf. e.g. the reviews [12, 13] ), which can explain most of the cosmological observations with high proficiency. Nevertheless, the aforementioned theoretical conundrums, together with few persistent tensions in some relevant parameters of the model as the Hubble parameter H 0 [8, 14] and the root-mean-square (rms) of mass fluctuations at scales of 8h \u22121 Mpc [15] , \u03c3 8 (or S 8 = \u03c3 8 (\u2126 (0) m /0.3) 0.5 1 [16] ), with h being the reduced Hubble parameter , motivate theoretical cosmologists to look for alternative scenarios in which these problems can be solved or, at least, alleviated, see [17, 18] and references therein. Wherever the solution comes from, i.e. a departure from General Relativity or some sort of new field describing dark energy (DE), it must mimic very well the behavior of a cosmological constant at low redshifts, meaning that the corresponding effective equation of state (EoS) parameter must be very close to -1, and that the new component must not be able to cluster efficiently at low scales.",

These interactions extended the original quintessence models [21] [22] [23] [24] . They cannot be ruled out a priori and, hence, they must be duly constrained by experiments and observations. Some works already set constraints on this model, but using older cosmological data sets, for instance CMB data from the WMAP satellite and the South Pole Telescope [25] , or considering past (2013, 2015) releases of Planck CMB data in combination with other data sets, as e.g. from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and SNIa, [26, 27] . Intriguingly, these works detected a likelihood peak at a non-vanishing value of the coupling constant. One of the main goals of this paper is then to critically revisit and update these results in the light of the recent strengthening of the H 0 tension and of the rich amount of currently available data at our disposal, in particular the Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization and lensing data, but also other new cosmological data, for instance Refs.

The DM particles interact with the DE due to the \u03c6-dependent mass term appearing in (1) . Such interaction introduces a fifth force that alters the trajectory in space-time of the DM with respect to the one found in the uncoupled case. Depending on the strength of the force, this model can be force-accelerated, as opposed to fluid-accelerated, adopting the terminology of [49] . As we do not couple \u03c6 to the standard model sector we avoid the stringent local (solar system) constraints on the violation of the weak equivalence principle [50] , and also on screened fifth forces that couple \u03c6 to non-dark matter, e.g. from Casimir experiments [51] , precision measurements of the electron magnetic moment [52] , or measurements of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s parameter [53] .

Figure 1 ). During this phase the effective EoS parameter, i.e. the ratio of the total pressure and the critical energy density in the Universe, is given by w eff = \u2126 \u03c6 , and hence the deceleration parameter reads q = 1 2 (1 + 3 w eff ) = 1 2 + \u03b2 2 . Thus, the coupling between DM and DE makes the Universe more decelerated with respect to the uncoupled quintessence case during the matter-dominated epoch (MDE). This fact together with the fifth force that enters now as a new source term in the Poisson equation help matter inhomogeneities to grow faster for larger values of \u03b2. We also remark that for fixed values of the present energy densities, matter becomes dominant over radiation earlier in time when \u03b2 > 0, with respect to the uncoupled case. In the CDE scenario, the equation for the DM density contrast \u03b4 dm = \u03b4\u03c1 dm /\u03c1 dm at deep subhorizon scales (k H) and when non-linear processes are unimportant, reads,",

Hence, larger values of \u03b2 enhance the matter power spectrum (see the left plot of Figure 2 ) and leave an imprint on the CMB temperature anisotropies. First, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect [55] is enhanced during the MDE earlier than in the uncoupled scenario, in which such effect is only relevant after matter-domination; second, the coupling affects lensing of CMB by large scale structure; the interaction also shifts the position of the acoustic peaks to larger multipoles due to the decrease of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, which is caused by the increase of the mass of the DM particles (this latter effect is however typically very small and subdominant). Finally, the amplitude is suppressed, because of the decrease of \u03c1 b /\u03c1 dm at recombination. These two effects explain why the coupling strength is degenerate with the Hubble parameter today [26] , whose value is related to the position and overall amplitude of the first peak. These and other aspects of the structure formation were already discussed in [48, [56] [57] [58] . See therein for further details, and also the plots in Figure 2 .",

The Bayesian exploration of the parameter space of the model in the light of the various data sets described in section IV has been carried out with the Monte Carlo sampler Montepython 3 [66] . Our code lets us skip the shooting method that is employed in IDEA to match the initial conditions with the current values of the cosmological energy densities, and this allows us to improve the computational efficiency of our Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, cf. appendix A for details. We have also used the Python package GetDist 4 [67] to process the chains and obtain the mean values and uncertainties of the parameters reported in Tables I-III, as well  as the contours of Figs. 3-4 .

Temperature and polarization spectra are already lensed, however the CMB lensing likelihood includes on top of lensed spectra also the 4-point correlation function. Lensing peak sensitivity is to lenses at z \u2248 2, half-way to the last-scattering surface, with deflection effects at redshifts which are relevant for dark energy models such as CDE. It has in particular been shown in [27] that CMB lensing pushes constraints towards \u039bCDM. As stated in [8] , we note that the lensing likelihood assumes a fiducial \u039bCDM model, with linear corrections to the fiducial model accounted for selfconsistently. According to [8] this procedure is unbiased, at least up to when the lensing spectrum differs from the fiducial spectrum by as much as 20%, estimated to be larger than differences allowed by the CMB lensing data. While further independent validation of such tests would be interesting for future analyses on modified gravity, we find it important to comment on results with/without CMB lensing inclusion for the purpose of testing nonminimal extensions of \u039bCDM, such as CDE.",

The (small) negative values of \u03c7 2 min.CDE \u2212 \u03c7 2 min,\u039b tell us that CDE is able to fit slightly better the data than the \u039bCDM; if we use as an alternative estimator the Bayes factor, we find negative values of ln(BCDE,\u039b), indicating a preference for the \u039bCDM model. See section V for a thorough discussion of the results. the SH0ES constraint on the absolute magnitude of the SNIa rather than the direct prior on H 0 when combined with low-redshift SNIa data.

In this case, the best fit corresponds to a value of \u03b2 = 0.0294 +0.0120 \u22120.0076 , i.e. at 3\u03c3 from zero coupling, a value of \u03b1 = 1.32 \u00b1 0.18, with \u03b1 > 0 at \u223c 7\u03c3 c.l., and H 0 = (69.43 +0. 72 \u22120.53 ) km/s/Mpc. The raise of H 0 is possible thanks to the increase of \u03b2, which in turn needs also larger values of \u03b1. The tension with the SH0ES+H0LICOW measurement (9) is slightly reduced from 4.8\u03c3 (when only P18 is used to constrain the model, cf. the first column of Table I ) to 3.5\u03c3 (when also the SH0ES+H0LICOW data are considered). This shifts the H 0 value 1.9\u03c3 higher than the best fit using the P18 data set alone, within CDE. Combining also with background data, such as BSC, can partially break degeneracies and leads to \u03b1 = 0.73 +0. 11 \u22120.27 , with \u03b1 > 0 at 3.8\u03c3 and H 0 = (68.79 +0. 35 \u22120.40 ) km/s/Mpc at 4.3\u03c3 from the SH0ES+H0LICOW value (9) , reducing the chance of CDE to alleviate the tension, as shown in the penulti-mate column of the table. Finally, the impact of adding CMB lensing is shown in the last column, where now \u03b2 = 0.0197 +0.0094 \u22120.0084 and \u03b1 = 0.33 +0.19 \u22120.23 , with \u03b2 > 0 and \u03b1 > 0 at 2.2\u03c3 and 1.6\u03c3, respectively, i.e. shifting back towards \u039bCDM. In this case H 0 = (68.99\u00b10.51) km/s/Mpc, 3.9\u03c3 away from the SH0ES+H0LICOW value (9) and even more had we included also BSC.",

Notice that the computation of (12) is not an easy task in general, since we usually work with models with a high number of (mostly nuisance) parameters, so the integrals under consideration becomes quite involved. We have computed the evidences numerically using the Markov chains obtained from the Monte Carlo analyses and with the aid of the numerical code MCEvidence [68] , which is publicly available (cf. section III). We report the values obtained for the natural logarithm of the Bayes ratio (12) in the last row of Table I. For all the data sets under study we find values of ln(B CDE,\u039b ) < \u22125, which point to a preference of the \u039bCDM over the CDE model according to Jeffreys' scale [17, 114, 115] . Although the CDE model we are studying here is able to reduce slightly the value of \u03c7 2 min w.r.t. the \u039bCDM, it has two additional parameters, namely \u03b1 and \u03b2. Moreover, the initial value of the scalar field, \u03c6 ini , is also left free in the Monte Carlo analysis, cf. Appendix A for details 13 . It turns out that the decrease in \u03c7 2 min is insufficient to compensate the penalization introduced by the use of these extra parameters. If instead of using the evidences (11) and the Bayes ratio (12) to perform the model comparison we make use of e.g. the Akaike [116] , Bayesian [117] or Deviance [118] information criteria, we reach similar conclusions 14 . We want to note, 13 In the computation of the evidence (11) for the CDE model we have employed the following flat priors for the extra parameters: 0 < \u03b2 < 0.1, 0 < \u03b1 < 2, and 0 < \u03ba\u03c6 ini < 50. Slightly broader or tighter priors can be considered, but ln(B CDE,\u039b ) only changes logarithmically, so our conclusions are not very sensitive to them. 14 For instance, Akaike criterion [116] is given by AIC = \u03c7 2 min +2n, where n is the number of parameters in the model (the degree of correlation between them is not taken into account). Consid-though, that all these information criteria are approximations of the exact Bayesian approach. Although they allow to skip the demanding computation of the evidence (11) , they are only reliable when the posterior distribution is close to a multivariate Gaussian (which is not the case under study), and the Akaike and Bayesian criteria do not take into account the impact of priors nor the existing correlations between the parameters.",

With regard to H 0 , we find that under the P18+SH0ES+H0LICOW combined data set the simple coupled model with constant coupling investigated in this work leads to a value in 3.5\u03c3 tension with (9) , or in 4.3\u03c3 tension when including further background data. The values of \u03c3 8 are also similar to those found in the \u039bCDM (i.e. \u03c3 8 \u223c 0.80 \u2212 0.82), even when RSD data are considered together with CMB and background data. In this case we find \u03b2 = 0.010 +0.003 \u22120.009 and \u03b2 = 0.015 +0.007 \u22120.008 , with and without CMB lensing, respectively.

The solution (13) does not depend on the form of the scalar field potential, since the impact of the latter is completely negligible during the RDE, and consists of a constant term plus a fast decaying mode, which we will call \u03c6 cons and \u03c6 dec , respectively.

            "text": "Here we present and discuss the fitting results for the two nested models of the CDE scenario that are obtained by turning off the interaction, and also by using a constant potential while keeping active the interaction in the dark sector. These two models are obtained from the general CDE scenario described in section II by setting \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b1 = 0, respectively. The former corresponds to the PR model [23, 24] . In Table II we show the constraints obtained for these models in the light of the P18+BSC+RSD data set, and also compare their statistical performance with the \u039bCDM and the full CDE model. In practice, they both have one additional parameter w.r.t. the \u039bCDM. The PR model has a very effective attractor solution for \u03c6 and \u03c6 during the radiationdominated epoch, which can be used to fix the initial conditions of the scalar field and its derivative, so only \u03b1 enters as an additional parameter (see e.g. [60] ). On the other hand, the CDE model with flat potential only has \u03b2 as extra parameter, since the equations are invariant under translations of the scalar field and hence \u03c6 ini can be fixed to an arbitrary value, e.g. 0. Moreover, \u03c6 ini can be set as explained in the appendix A. Table II shows that in the context of the PR model it is possible to obtain much lower values of \u03c3 8 , loosening in this way the \u03c3 8 tension. H 0 , though, is below the one obtained with the \u039bCDM and the other two nested models. These results are fully aligned with those from [62] , but now we obtain lesser levels of evidence for the PR model, basically due to the use of the CMB high multipole polarization data, which were not employed in that reference. The reduction in the value of \u03c7 2 min w.r.t. the \u039bCDM is \u223c 2 units, but ln(B PR,\u039b ) < \u22123, so there is still more evidence for the concordance model when compared with the PR. One thing that we should explain is why the value of \u03c7 2 min obtained with the PR model is lower than in the general CDE model. We would expect this not to happen, since the latter is an extension of the former, with two extra free parameters. The reason is the following. In our Monte Carlo analysis for the CDE model we cannot explore the region of parameter space with a pure PR behavior. In order this to happen we should produce values of \u03b2 in our chains much lower than the ones we actually produce (which are in all cases greater than \u223c 10 \u22123 due to the flat prior on \u03b2 > 0 and its typical variance). These values of \u03b2 always give rise to non-completely negligible effects in the MDE, and hence there is always a departure from the pure PR model. Thus, it is not strange that we find points in parameter space of the PR model which lead to lower values of \u03c7 2 than those found in our analysis of the CDE.",

In terms of Occam's razor and the corresponding Bayes ratio there is a preference for the \u039bCDM. The central value of \u03b2 is almost four times smaller than in the general CDE model. Something similar happens in the PR model for \u03b1, which is now \u223c 7 times smaller than in the general CDE scenario.

As mentioned in section II, the quintessence potential only rules the scalar field dynamics in the late-time universe, after the \u03c6MDE epoch, when the effects coming from the interaction in the dark sector are already subdominant. There-fore, we should not expect a change in the form of the potential to affect severely the constraints on the coupling strength \u03b2, and this is actually what we find. By comparing the results provided in Tables I and III obtained under the same data sets we notice that both, the central values and uncertainties for \u03b2, are almost identical. They are also similar to the values reported in Table  II of [33] , which were obtained using the CMB likelihoods from Planck 2015, older SNIa, BAO and CCH data, and also older distance ladder priors on the Hubble parameter. Our constraints are a little bit tighter due to the updated (richer) data sets employed here. Also the values of \u03bb are quite similar. We note, though, that the central values of H 0 are mildly (\u223c 1\u03c3) lower than those obtained with the Peebles-Ratra potential. The values of ln B CDE,\u039b are higher (lower in absolute value) since in this model the goodness of fit is kept at the same level as in the CDE model with PR potential, and \u03c6 ini plays no role and can be fixed, reducing thereby the complexity of the model.

            "text": "APPENDIX A: AVOIDING THE SHOOTING IDEA takes as input parameters the current energy densities of the various species and applies a shooting method (see e.g. [121] ) to find the initial energy densities that lead to the present-day values specified in the input. This is of course a very useful and convenient way of implementing the model, since very often we are interested in computing theoretical quantities by fixing the current energy densities to concrete values, most of the times very close to the best-fit \u039bCDM ones. This trial and error method is unavoidable if one wants to do so. Nevertheless, this is not the most efficient way to proceed at the level of the Monte Carlo analysis. The avoidance of the shooting recursive process by directly using as input parameters the initial conditions of the energy densities instead of their current values allows us to save precious computational time. In our implementation of the CDE model in CLASS [63] we have skipped the shooting method proceeding in this way. The current energy densities and other quantities of interest, e.g. H 0 or \u03c3 8 , are obtained as derived parameters after solving the com-plete set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations up to a = 1. We also use as input parameter in the Monte Carlo the initial value of the scalar field, \u03c6 ini = \u03c6(a ini ) > 0, with a ini = 10 \u221214 . On the contrary, \u03c6 ini = \u03c6 (a ini ) can be expressed in terms of other input parameters. Let us show how. By solving (3) in the radiation-dominated epoch (RDE) we find,where c 0 is a dimensionless integration constant, \u03c2 \u2261 1 km/s/Mpc = 2.1332 \u00d7 10 \u221244 GeV (in natural units), and \u03c9 * r = \u03c9 \u03b3 (1 + 0.2271N ef f ) is the reduced density parameter of radiation during the RDE. We consider three massive neutrinos with equal mass and \u03bd m \u03bd = 0.06 eV, so N eff = 3.046. The parameter \u03c9 \u03b3 is determined by the temperature of the CMB photons at present, which we set to the value reported in [122] , TNotice that the ratio \u2126 dm (a)/a appearing in (13) is kept constant during the RDE. To understand this let us consider equation (4) . It can be rewritten as",
