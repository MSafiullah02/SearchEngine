            "text": "The primary cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently it has been noticed that the viral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and cell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates. They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 \u00b52 subunit as well as I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2 and integrin \u03b23, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit autophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a conserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by \u03b2 integrins for ligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2 share common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility that it might be possible to develop host-directed therapies to dampen the efficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence conservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless, SLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to be functional. Receptor Mediated Endocytosis (RME) is a cellular import process triggered by cell surface receptor proteins, including any cargoes attached to them, in which a large vesicular structure is assembled entirely through cooperative low affinity interactions of SLiMs and phospholipid head groups with their globular protein domain partners. The vesicles are strong and stable, yet flexible and dynamically assembled and disassembled. The external triggering of surface receptors (many of which have the YxxPhi or NPxY tyrosine sorting motifs) is transmitted across the plasma membrane, inducing local enzymatic modification of lipid head-groups from PI4P to (PI(4,5)P2) by the PIPK1 kinase. The local enrichment of (PI(4,5)P2) enables binding of domains such as ENTH in Epsins which can begin to curve the membrane and assemble clathrin cages using their Clathrin Box motif and also attract additional adapter proteins via yet more SLiMs. In turn, additional sets of SLiM-bearing proteins stimulate the actin filament formation and attachment, necessary to fold and pull the invagination into the cytosol. Later, Dynamin binds directly to (PI(4,5)P2) on the membrane to complete the scission process. Once in the cytosol, the clathrin-coated vesicles are soon dismantled and the contents are included into the early endosomes.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, whose members are common human pathogens responsible for the common cold, as well as for some emerging severe respiratory diseases. Among them are the SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the former of which caused over 8,000 cases in 2003 with a fatality rate of ~10%, and the latter caused about 2,500 infections in 2012 with a fatality rate of 37% (de Wit et al., 2016) . Another coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), infects birds and has been used as a model in coronavirus research (Sisk et al., 2018) . SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) , uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to attach to the host cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; P.

Integrins are special types of receptors, as they propagate signals in both directions; extracellular ligands can induce cytoplasmic pathway activation, but intracellular binding on the cytosolic tails can influence the structure of the ectodomains and hence ligand-binding affinity. The complexity of integrin signalling stems in the dimeric structure of integrins, as they are composed of two subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2. For the RGD-binding integrins, the ligand binding surface lies at the interface of the two integrin subunits with both subunits making contacts with the ligand. These RGD motifs are recognized by at least 8 out of the 24 human integrins, and the flanking residues next to the core RGD motif are known to play a huge role in selectivity (Kapp et al., 2017) . Several viral proteins contain RGD (or RGD-like) short linear motifs (SLiMs) for integrin modulation; and in addition, some viruses can not only use integrins on the host cell surface, but HIV and SIV can also incorporate integrins into their own membranes for mediating interactions with the host (Guzzo et al., 2017) . Therefore, integrins can potentially be targeted at both the extracellular and the intracellular side to combat pathogenic hijacking.",

To achieve this, a large number of host processes are hijacked using SLiMs often located in intrinsically disordered regions to establish protein-protein interactions with host proteins or undergo post-translational modifications, like tyrosine phosphorylation. For example, cellular signalling relies heavily on the use of SLiMs (Van Roey et al., 2013 . The low affinity and cooperativity of SLiM-based molecular processes allow reversible and transient interactions that can work as switches between distinct functional states and are regulated both in time and space (Gibson, 2009; Scott and Pawson, 2009) . Conditional switching of SLiMs, for example through phosphorylation, can induce the exchange of binding partners for a protein, thus mediating molecular decision-making in response to signals reporting on the cell state (Van Roey et al., 2012) . The central resource for SLiMs is the Eukaryotic Linear Motif database (ELM; http://elm.eu.org/), also serving as an exploratory server for over 280 manually curated SLiM classes with experimental evidence, each defined by a POSIX regular expression (Kumar et al., 2020) .",

In the remainder of the introduction, we will describe some of the major pathways hijacked by viruses to accomplish cell attachment, entry and replication, which are suggested by our results to be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process in eukaryotes with multiple cellular roles that include the regulation of cellular homeostasis through the catabolism of cell components, immune development and the host cell response to infection through pathogen phagocytosis (Deretic and Levine, 2009) . Viruses have evolved mechanisms to block the host cell antiviral response, and can further hijack autophagy components to promote their survival and replication. This can be done through viral mimicry of host proteins coordinating autophagy or through the direct inhibition of the host autophagy machinery (Kudchodkar and Levine, 2009) . Coronaviruses (CoVs) exploit the autophagy machinery through different mechanisms (Cong et al., 2017; Maier and Britton, 2012) . For example, MERS-CoV targets the BECN1 autophagy regulator for degradation, blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and protecting the virus from degradation (Gassen et al., 2019) . Coronaviruses repurpose cellular membranes to create double membrane vesicles (DMVs) onto which the replication-transcription complex (RTC) is assembled, a process that involves recruitment of multiple autophagy components (Cong et al., 2017; Prentice et al., 2004; V'kovski et al., 2019) . Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RTCs assemble by recruiting LC3-I, a nonlipidated form of the LC3 autophagy protein (Cong et al., 2017; Reggiori et al., 2010) , and SARS-CoV RTCs also colocalize with LC3 (Prentice et al., 2004) . Proximity-based mass spectrometry on the MHV replication complex further revealed that the RTC environment repurposes components from the host autophagy, vesicular trafficking and translation machineries (V'kovski et al., 2019) In the present work, we identify a set of conserved SLiM candidates in the ACE2 and integrin proteins, which are likely to act in the cell entry system of SARS-CoV-2. These motifs can provide molecular links to understand how the virus recognizes target membranes, enters into cells, and how it repurposes intracellular membrane components to drive its replication. These molecular links might provide novel clues towards drugging SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first focus on the extracellular SLiMs, before moving across the membrane to examine the cytosolic potential of the receptor tails.",

There is no solved complex structure of the ACE2-integrin complex. However, further structural consideration may indicate whether the Spike-ACE2 and the Spike-integrin interactions can coexist. The ectodomains of both ACE2 and integrins in the open conformation are roughly the same size measured from the membrane, being in the 150-200 \u00c5 range (based on available structures PDB:6m17 and PDB:3ije (Xiong et al., 2009) ). This means that the RGD-binding site of integrins and the RBD binding regions of ACE2 are relatively close in space. In addition, in the more open 'up' conformation of the RBDs, the distance between pairs of RBDs is about 100 \u00c5 (based on the structure PDB:6vsb reported in (Wrapp et al., 2020) ), which is probably larger than the distance between the ACE2 binding region and the integrin ligand binding site, estimated from the individual integrin and ACE2 structures.",

As evidenced by crystallized integrin dimer:ligand complexes, the residue preceding RGD is in contact with the \u03b1 subunit, while the residue after the core motif interacts with the \u03b2 subunit. The immediate context of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD motif is 402-IRGDE-406, which can give an indication about possible integrin targets. IRGD can be found in several native integrin-binding partners, including FREM1 , MFAP4 (Pilecki et al., 2015) and IGFBP1/2 (Cavaill\u00e9 et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006) . These extracellular matrix proteins target integrins with \u03b1v, \u03b15 and \u03b18 subunits. RGDE is present in the native human integrin ligands TGF-\u03b21, osteolectin, collagen \u03b1-1(VI) chain, PSBG-9 and polydom, and in vitro and in vivo binding studies on the specificity profiles of these proteins (Cescon et al., 2015; Rattila et al., 2019; Sato-Nishiuchi et al., 2012; Shanley et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2019; Tumbarello et al., 2012) highlighted a post-RGD Glu to be efficient in binding to \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b23 integrin subunits. Correlating these preferences with possible \u03b1 and \u03b2 integrin subunit pairings points to the most likely candidate target integrins for SARS-CoV-2 being \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b18\u03b21.",

RGD-mediated binding to integrins is metal mediated (via divalent cations like Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ), and all integrins have a so-called 'metal ion-dependent adhesion site' (MIDAS) motif (DxSxS) (Lee et al., 1995) . The integrin MIDAS structural motif is located near the ligand binding site on the \u03b2 subunit and is essential for binding, as sidechains belonging to the motif and an acidic residue from the ligand coordinate the metal ion together (Zhang and Chen, 2012) . ACE2 also has a similar DxSxS motif (see Table 1 ), that might facilitate interactions with ligands that are recognized by integrins, possibly creating an overlap between the ligand binding profiles and regulation of the two receptors. In the known structures where Spike is bound to ACE2 the RGD motif is not in contact with the ACE2 MIDAS . However, the MIDAS motif is highly conserved across species (see Figure 2) , and surface exposed. Consequently it may still be involved in mediating an interaction with an RGD-like motif, potentially serving as a parallel mechanism for binding the Spike protein. ",

Nearly all PCs contain an RGD motif, and while its role in integrin binding is not clear, the motif has been shown to be required for proper functioning for several PCs (Lou et al., 2007; Lusson et al., 1997; Rov\u00e8re et al., 1999) .

Contextual information, including cell compartment localisation and functional relevance, is important in deciding whether a motif candidate is worth testing experimentally (Gibson et al., 2015) . Furthermore, in intrinsically unstructured protein sequence, amino acid conservation is indicative of functional interactions. Therefore, an alignment was prepared of vertebrate ACE2 proteins. All of the detected motif matches (shown in Table 1 together with potential binding partner domains defined using Pfam and InterPro (Mitchell et al., 2019) ) were conserved in mammals, most were conserved with birds and mammals and some were conserved with extant reptiles ( Figure 3 ). These groups diverged from one another >300 million years ago (Kemp, 2005) indicating a strong conservation of all candidate motifs. In addition, the functional contexts of these motifs are biologically coherent, involving signalling by tyrosine kinases, endocytosis, autophagy and actin filament induction (Table 1 ). In the following subsections we briefly summarise each of the conserved motifs and their possible role in the viral entry mechanism.",

The sequence found in ACE2 (781-YASID-785) best matches the binding specificity for the SH2 domain present in NCK1/2 proteins, which belong to the Class IA SH2 domains (Kaneko et al., 2010) . Proteins known to contain this motif are listed in entry ELM:LIG_SH2_NCK1_1. NCK proteins are adaptor proteins that modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Buday et al., 2002) . For example, NCK is recruited to the cell membrane by the Nephrin protein, following tyrosine signalling that creates several NCK SH2 binding motifs in Nephrin (Blasutig et al., 2008) . Once recruited to the membrane, NCK activates Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WASP) family proteins through the use of a helical binding motif (ELM:LIG_GBD_CHELIX_1) that relieves WASP autoinhibition and allows the recruitment of the actin regulatory protein complex Arp2/3, which leads to the initiation of actin polymerization (Okrut et al., 2015) . The NCK binding motif is exploited by two known human pathogens, namely enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and vaccinia virus (Frese et al., 2006) . The residues present at pY+1, pY+2 and pY+4 rule out that the ACE2 YASID motif can be a strong Grb2, CRK or STAP1 SH2 domain binder, and binding to STAT1/2/3 SH2 domains is also unlikely due to the lack of adequate specificity determinants. Other SH2 domains (e.g. Src-related) could be recruited by ACE2, and experimental validation will be required to test these hypotheses.",

This motif was initially described in the bacterial secreted protein translocated intimin receptor (Tir) from pathogenic strains of E. coli like enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The NPY tripeptide recognizes and binds with a 60 \u03bcM affinity to inverse Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (I-BAR) domains in adaptor proteins like insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53) and its homolog insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS) (Campellone et al., 2006; de Groot et al., 2011) . I-BAR domains bind to the plasma membrane to favour weak membrane protrusions, and the preference of I-BAR domains for negative membrane curvatures enables a positive feedback loop that can result in the formation of lamellipodia, filopodia and other types of membrane protrusions Pr\u00e9vost et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2011) . IRSp53 and IRTKS are modular proteins that contain SH3 domains which in turn recognize PxxP SLiMs in actin filament regulators like Mena, Eps8 and mDia1 (Ahmed et al., 2010) resulting in the formation of membrane protrusions through actin filament formation (Campellone et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2015; Pr\u00e9vost et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2011) . Moreover, IRSp53 has an additional Cdc42-binding motif that can result in a direct WASP activation (Ahmed et al., 2010) . During EHEC infection, the bacteria uses the NPY motif in the transmembrane protein Tir to recruit IRSp53 (Campellone et al., 2006) . IRSp53 acts as a scaffold to localize the injected bacterial protein EspFU to the bacterial attachment site, cytosolic side, through the binding of a PxxP motif in EspFU to the IRSp53 SH3 domain. Through the use of the same helical SLiM present in NCK (ELM:LIG_GBD_CHELIX_1), EspFU acts as a potent WASP activator, inducing the actin polymerization that contributes to the pedestal formation characteristic of EHEC infections (Cheng et al., 2008; Sallee et al., 2008) . The NPY SLiM, although not yet experimentally validated in any human protein, is potentially functional in proteins like SHANK2 or the microtubule-binding CLIP-associating protein 1 (CLASP1), based on protein conservation and functional association (de Groot et al., 2011) . The putative NPY motif in ACE2 is conserved in all analysed mammalian and bird homologs (Figure 3) , suggesting a direct interaction with host I-BAR-containing proteins such as IRSp53 or IRTKS, which are expressed in lung tissues (Uhl\u00e9n et al., 2015) .",

During viral cell entry, the NPY motif could recruit I-BAR-containing proteins such as IRSp53 or IRTKS, resulting in membrane protrusion formation that could be exploited for viral entry or in cell to cell transmission. It is known that the hijack of the filopodia formation network is beneficial for the entry and spreading of many enveloped viruses (reviewed in Chang et al., 2016) , but whether this process is active during coronavirus infection is still unclear. A second route might cooperate with the NPY motif in the recruitment of actin cytoskeleton components. A direct interaction between the SARS-CoV Spike protein cytosolic side C-terminal domain and the Ezrin FERM domain can occur during the opening of the viral fusion pore and has been proposed to restrain viral infection (Millet et al., 2012) . Ezrin is a protein involved in cell morphology and apical membrane remodelling that acts as a membranecytoskeleton linker. Ezrin recruits F-actin through its C-terminal domain, and can also bind to IRSp53 located at negatively curved membranes (Saleh et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2018) , suggesting that while the NPY motif acts at earlier stages of viral attachment, the Spike protein/Ezrin interaction might work during or after viral fusion, to promote the recruitment of actin regulatory components to viral fusion sites.",

The NPxY motifs in cytosolic tails of receptors, including integrins, are regarded as endocytosis sorting signals (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003) . It was later discovered that PTB domains in the internalisation adapter protein Dab1 could also bind non-phosphorylated Nxx[FY] motifs (apoPTB motif) and that this might be the case for the majority of PTBs (Uhlik et al., 2005) . Representative receptors with apoPTB motifs are in the database entry ELM:LIG_PTB_Apo_2. In ACE2, the core NxxF motif is conserved in all land vertebrates ( Figure 3 ). For Dab1 apoPTB motifs, there is a hydrophobic requirement two residues before the Asn. In ACE2, this is predominantly a charged residue: Therefore, if this strikingly conserved NxxF is an apoPTB motif, it should bind a protein other than Dab1 and proteins with related specificities. The apoPTB motif binds as a short \u03b2-strand (\u03b2-augmentation) followed by a \u03b2-turn. Proline is rejected at one strand-forming position and therefore the regular expression for this motif would be [^P] .N..F for land vertebrates or [EQ] .N..F for mammals. As with the phosphorylated versions, the apo-motifs are tightly connected to endocytosis (Uhlik et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Autophagy, the recycling of cellular material, is vital for cellular homeostasis. Many pathogens must control the autophagy response to establish productive infection (Deretic and Levine, 2009) . It has been shown that coronaviruses, including human CoVs, subvert autophagy components to promote viral replication at DMVs associated to the RTC (Cottam et al., 2014; Fung and Liu, 2019; Gassen et al., 2019; Reggiori et al., 2010) . The LIR motif is required for the interaction of a target protein with Atg8 or its homologues LC3 and GABARAP to facilitate autophagy of the target via the autophagosome (Birgisdottir et al., 2013) . The LIR motif has been catalogued in the ELM resource entry ELM:LIG_LIR_Gen_1 which detected a candidate motif in the human ACE2 cytosolic tail sequence (Figure 3 ). After the LIR motif was annotated in ELM, a more recently solved LC3-LIR structure (PDB:5cx3) showed that the interacting peptide is longer, with one or two more hydrophobic interactions (Olsvik et al., 2015) . LIR enters a hydrophobic groove bordered by positively charged residues. A core [WFY]xx[ILMV] enters the deepest part of the groove. On either side of the core, the interacting residues can be flexibly spaced. The core must be preceded by a negatively-charged residue (which might be enabled by phosphorylation). Further, the motif core is followed by a flexibly spaced hydrophobic residue. There is often a negatively-charged residue preceding this hydrophobic position: it can make favourable interactions with counter charges but is not an absolute requirement, so is not included in the revised motif pattern. Based on the structure (PDB:5cx3) and some SPOT arrays (Alemu et al., 2012; Olsvik et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2019) matches the motifs annotated in ELM. The revised motif is conserved in the mammalian ACE2 cytosolic tail, but not in birds or reptiles. The ACE2 LIR motif candidate can potentially enable the incoming coronavirus to attract autophagy elements such as LC3 to the structures where the virus replicates and assembles. In line with this, a nonlipidated form of the LC3 protein has been shown to be associated with the RTCs of MHV and SARS-CoV (Cong et al., 2017; Prentice et al., 2004; Reggiori et al., 2010) . This brings up the interesting possibility that ACE2 remains associated with the membranous structures where SARS-CoV-2 replicates at later infection stages, assisting in the repurposing of autophagy components required for viral replication.",

NHERF3 is co-localised with ACE2 in intestinal tissue, and its PDZ domains were previously validated to interact with PBMs in transmembrane proteins on the cytosolic side of the membrane (Gisler et al., 2003) , so it is possible they come in proximity with the ACE2 tail containing the TxF$ motif, and possibly bind it as a part of ion exchange regulation of small molecule transport activities. NHERF3 is known for its involvement in sodium ion-dependent transporter activity (Srivastava et al., 2019) , and ACE2 was also shown to interact with a sodium-dependent transporter , which could be one of the leads towards unravelling the possible interaction between NHERF3 and ACE2. NHERF3 (gene name PDZK1) and ACE2 share a network of experimentally validated protein-protein interactions localized at the cell membrane ( Figure 4) . These proteins share localisation and function characteristics, and some of them could turn out to be the missing puzzle pieces to connect ACE2 and NHERF3 as possible interactors.",

While the YxxPhi, NPY and LIR motifs require a non-phosphorylated state of Tyr781, the NCK motif requires Tyr781 phosphorylation, creating the opportunity for a four way molecular phospho-switch acting in this region of ACE2 that directs different steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle. The state of this switch can be controlled by tyrosine kinase activity involving the Src/Abl and other tyrosine kinases known to be upregulated during endosomal processes (Reinecke and Caplan, 2014 ) and viral infection (Davey et al., 2011) including in coronaviruses (Coleman et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2018; Sisk et al., 2018) . Similar two-way switches have been described before, as with the CTLA-4 receptors, where Src-family tyrosine kinases dictate the binding preferences of overlapping YxxPhi and SH2 binding motifs. In the non-phosphorylated state endocytosis is favoured, whereas T cell activation brings about Tyr phosphorylation, shutting down endosomal recycling and initiating signalling through the recruitment of SH2-domain containing proteins (Bradshaw et al., 1997; Miyatake et al., 1998; Ohno et al., 1996; Owen and Evans, 1998; Shiratori et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "During early stages of viral infection, and following viral attachment to the host cell membrane, the YxxPhi motif could activate the early events of receptor-mediated endocytosis by binding the \u00b5 subunit of the AP2 complex, which in turn recruits clathrin and other endocytic components to the viral attachment sites. Following the formation of the clathrin coat and initial invagination, actin polymerization is required to assist in the internalization of the endocytic vesicles. In addition, some viruses can 'surf' along filopodia by myosin-mediated actin cytoskeleton movements that transport the viral particles to the entry sites at the cell body, ultimately increasing their entry rate (reviewed in Chang et al., 2016) . The actin hijack related to endocytic uptake and the formation of membrane protrusions could be coordinated in one or several stages by the NCK SH2 and NPY motifs respectively, by recruiting WASP and I-BAR proteins to the viral attachment site. This might be enacted by a Tyr781 phosphorylation switch that is regulated in time with early attachment characterized by non-phosphorylated Tyr781 that allows the YxxPhi and NPY motifs to be active, and a later phase where Tyr781 becomes phosphorylated, inactivating the YxxPhi and NPY motifs and bringing the NCK SH2 motif into play. An alternative scenario might be enabled by the multimeric nature of the Spike protein and by attachment of several viral particles to a membrane domain, leading to adjacent ACE2 tails on the intracellular side that expose both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated motifs, allowing these three signalling steps to take place simultaneously. The presence of several parallel routes for the recruitment of cytoskeleton components involving the NPY and NCK motifs could provide robustness needed to ensure the actinreorganization required for the uptake of virus-containing vesicles into the cytosol. Following endocytosis and fusion, viral components are released into the cell and viral replication takes place. During this phase, the last component of the switch could come into play, when the ACE2 protein that remains bound to Spike protein-coated membranes could promote the hijack of autophagy components necessary to assemble the viral replication factories. At this time, non-phosphorylated ACE2 tails would recruit LC3 to replication structures through their LIR motifs.",

This motif is under heavy regulation by several mechanisms. First, the interaction with tyrosine kinases seem to involve additional residues N-terminal of the charged motif coremost notably the conserved lysine preceding the hydrophobic patch (Reddy et al., 1998) that are only accessible in the active state of the integrin dimer, as these regions are buried in the membrane otherwise (Stefansson et al., 2004) . Second, the D residue of the motif forms a salt bridge with the cytosolic tail of the \u03b1 subunit of the integrin in the inactive conformation of the receptor. Thus, this motif region is dependent on integrin activation regulated by ligand binding and intracellular interactions mediated by the C-terminally located NPxY motifs.",

Low throughput phosphorylation assays have determined that both Tyr773 and Tyr785 (required for the functional PTB NPxY motif) are in fact phosphorylated in vivo. However, such assays have also determined additional phosphorylation sites in the \u03b23 tail, Thr777, Ser778, Thr779 and Thr784. These phosphorylations aren't connected to the NPxY motif switches in any known way. However, the three phosphorylations between residues 777-779 and the following sequence region matches the LIR autophagy motif also found in the ACE2 tail. While the current motif definition does not exactly fit the \u03b21 tail, there is also low throughput phosphorylation assay data (Wennerberg et al., 1998) for the existence of these phosphorylations in the corresponding residues, hinting at the possibility of the presence of a slightly modified motif. For both \u03b21 and \u03b23 tails, the phosphorylation provides the negative charge required N-terminal of the FxxIxY LIR motif hydrophobic core. Phosphopeptides spanning the candidate region should reveal whether the LIR motif-like region is a functional Atg-binding site in integrin \u03b21, and also whether the multiple phosphorylations act as a rheostat, modulating the affinity of the interaction. The motif found in integrin \u03b23 is also present in integrin \u03b22, and the motif candidate identified in integrin \u03b21 is also present in integrin \u03b26. ",

Following attachment of Spike to the receptors, the two NPxY motifs in the integrin \u03b2 subunit could act cooperatively with the apoPTB and YxxPhi motifs in ACE2 as sorting signals that mediate the internalization of viral particles into endosomes. The presence of several endocytic motifs in close proximity would strengthen the interaction with the endocytosis apparatus creating a high-avidity environment for recruitment of RME components (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003) . During this time, the phosphorylated integrin NPxY motifs would also reinforce viral attachment through inside out signalling, stabilizing the integrin ectodomain in the open, high affinity ligand-binding conformation. As discussed previously, RME also involves the recruitment of adaptor molecules that activate rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton required for the internalization of the endocytic vesicle. At this stage, the NPY and NCK SH2 motifs in ACE2 would recruit several molecules that mediate actin polymerization signalling, prominently I-BAR containing proteins IRSp53 and IRTKS, and the WASP-Arp2/3 complex. While most of this actin signalling would serve to allow viral entry, additional actin recruitment processes could occur following viral fusion, such as that initiated by the interaction between the Spike protein and Ezrin. Finally, at later stages of infection, both integrins and ACE2 might remain attached to virus-associated DMVs and other replication-competent membranes where the RTC assembles. At this stage, ACE2 and integrins might cooperatively mediate the recruitment of autophagy components such as LC3, through the LIR motifs located in the cytosolic tails of both molecules.",

RGD mimics have been developed as inhibitors of integrin-extracellular matrix protein interaction for a variety of diseases. A cyclic RGD peptide (c-RGDfV, cilengitide) has been developed clinically for glioblastoma treatment and other cancers. It proved safe, but did not enhance the survival benefit (Stupp et al., 2014) . SARS-CoV-2 has a unique RGD sequence in the ACE2 binding region of its Spike protein. It has been speculated that integrins may have a potential role for infectivity (Sigrist et al., 2020) . Therefore, integrin inhibitors like RGD mimetics might be able to block the RGD binding site(s) on target cells and block the attachment of the virus. Another application that has been suggested is bacterial sepsis (sepsis is also a dreaded complication in COVID-19 patients), and experimental evidence in animals is available (Garciarena et al., 2017) . Cilengitide is relatively specific for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and also active on \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26. The antibody abituzumab (aka DI 17E6) is a pan-av antibody, i.e. also active against other \u03b1v integrins, and may consequently be better suited for blocking virus entry. It has been clinically tested in several cancer indications (\u00c9lez et al., 2015; Hussain et al., 2016) . Cilengitide and abituzumab are made available for in vitro testing in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by the company who developed it initially (contact: compound_donation@merckgroup.com).",

            "text": "As discussed above, tyrosine kinase mediated phosphorylation plays an important role in virus entry and maturation, and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed in the clinic and show effects on viral infection. For example, saracatinib, a Src and Abl inhibitor which has completed several clinical trials, including some cancers, inhibited replication of different coronaviruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E in cell culture infection experiments (Shin et al., 2018) . After internalization and endosomal trafficking, imatinib, an Abl inhibitor, prevented fusion of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV virions at the endosomal membrane in infected cell culture experiments (Coleman et al., 2016) . Using the avian model virus, IBV, imatinib and two other Abl inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, prevented the fusion of the Spike protein to the membrane of the target cell as well as cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation (Sisk et al., 2018) . More recently, tyrphostin A9, a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor came out from a high-throughput screening using cytopathic effect as readout, it also showed in vitro inhibitory capacity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an alpha coronavirus that infects pigs (Dong et al., 2020) . The authors also showed that tyrphostin A9 has a broad spectrum, being active against three other tested coronaviruses: MHV in L929 cells, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Vero cells and feline infectious peritonitis virus in CCL-94 cells. The mode of action was found to be through p38 MAPK, at the post-adsorption stage. As FAK has been implicated in viral entry for other viruses including influenza A (Elbahesh et al., 2014) , experimental drugs targeting FAK, including some in clinical trials (de Jonge et al., 2019) , can be considered for studying the potential Spike-induced integrin signalling. Currently, 39 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are approved by the FDA: eleven target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and 28 inhibit receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (Roskoski, 2020) . Consequently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be good candidates to test for their effect on SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "The situation with targeting autophagy seems unclear. Autophagy activators might help the cell to consume incoming virus -or speed up the establishment of the viral replication complexes and accelerate disease. Autophagy inhibitors might work in later stages of infection to dampen viral production, but this will depend on whether autophagy is active at the time or if the constituent components have been captured and effectively shut down. Several inhibitors/activators have been reported which can target autophagy and multiple auxiliary signals feeding into the process of autophagy (Table 2 ). One such axis is via the mTORC1 complex. Active mTORC1 keeps the autophagy process inhibited by phosphorylating the ULK complex which is a key regulator in autophagy. Inhibition of mTORC1 activates autophagy. Multiple FDA approved mTOR inhibitors are known and include Rapamycin and Everolimus. Rapamycin has been shown to be effective in cell culture for countering MERS-CoV infection and might assist in tackling SARS-CoV-2 infection (Kindrachuk et al., 2015) although the stage of infection might be crucial for the desired outcome. Simvastatin is another drug which is known to upregulate autophagy via the mTOR pathway (Wei et al., 2013) . Simvastatin has also been reported to alleviate airway inflammation in a mouse asthma model (Gu et al., 2017) . Another autophagy modulator is Niclosamide which regulates autophagy by targeting the autophagy regulator Beclin1 via SKP2 E3-ligase in MERS-CoV infection. In this case, reduced Beclin1 levels lead to blocking fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and hence the virus protects itself in the host (Gassen et al., 2019) . Overall, inhibiting SKP2 by Niclosamide relieves Beclin1, allowing autophagosome-lysosome fusion and resumption of autophagy to reduce the MERS-CoV production. In addition, niclosamide valinomycin has been shown to target SARS-CoV in cell cultures as well (Wu et al., 2004) .",

The Spike protein interacted with the GOLGA7-ZDHHC5 acyl-transferase complex, possibly for palmitoylation on Spike's cytosolic tail. Spike did not pull down ACE2 or any cell surface receptor protein, but these experiments are not an assay for viral entry, and therefore many protein interactions related to the viral entry mechanism are likely missing from these data. Therefore our observations of SLiM candidates in the viral attachment, entry and replication system reflect additional areas of the cell where drug repurposing for hostdirected therapy might be explored. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors have frequently been shown to dampen pathogen invasion and disease progression in cell culture, there has been little effort to move these findings into the clinic (S\u00e1mano-S\u00e1nchez and .

This would also be undesirable, because the immune system must mount a defence in order to prevent viral reinfection. Rather, dampening viral load during viral invasion or replication should be the target, to give the host defences time to respond. It is well known that drugs like Tamiflu that slows influenza exit, and therefore entry into uninfected cells, can only have a strong effect when taken prophylactically or early in infection (Bassetti et al., 2019) . Depending on the importance of integrins in SARS-CoV-2 lung cell entry, reducing viral entry is a possible role for cilengitide or other molecules that hamper integrin or ACE2 binding. An endocytosis inhibitor might play a similar role and is independent of receptor type. However, for any such inhibitor that passes the blood-brain barrier, effects on mood and other brain operations are an inevitable side effect: Even so, the endocytosis inhibitor chlorpromazine is a widely used drug with a well-known safety profile (Solmi et al., 2017) .",

Cilengitide, a relatively selective integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b26 inhibitor (a cyclic peptide that proved safe in patients, but failed to show a survival benefit in glioblastoma (Stupp et al., 2014) ) might be useful in two phases: it could block virus attachment to target cells, and it has also been proposed as a potential treatment in sepsis (Garciarena et al., 2017) . Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication among COVID-19 patients in Wuhan (F. . Another potential application of integrin inhibitors, especially integrin \u03b1v\u03b26, would be lung fibrosis -patients on respirators tend to develop lung fibrosis, and show increased \u03b1v\u03b26 levels (Horan et al., 2008) . The antibody abituzumab (aka DI 17E6) is a pan-\u03b1v antibody with high potency on \u03b1v\u03b26, i.e. also active against several \u03b1v integrins, and may consequently be better suited for blocking virus entry, or may be suitable for lung fibrosis or sepsis protection. It has been clinically tested in several cancer indications (\u00c9lez et al., 2015; Hussain et al., 2016) , and proved safe, but did not achieve a survival benefit in cancer.",

We identified several candidate molecular links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the (still poorly understood) mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. Because these motifs belong to host proteins acting as viral receptors, they are not revealed by virus-centred proteomic assays. Most of these putative motifs lack direct experimental evidence. That they may well be functional, however, is indicated by sequence conservation, in some cases for hundreds of millions of years. In addition, these motifs are in appropriate cellular contexts to interact with their respective partner proteins. Experimental validation will yield insights into receptor-mediated endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 virus and, in addition, for the role of ACE2 in the normal cell, where it surely has much more functionality than being an angiotensin converting enzyme. Overall, the collection of candidate motifs in this system suggests that a range of host directed therapies might be explored including RGD inhibition, tyrosine kinase inhibition, endocytosis inhibition and autophagy inhibition and/or activation. or InterPro (Mitchell et al., 2019) , where applicable motif candidates 2 xany residue, P 5 PC: proprotein convertases 3 '*' marks cleavage points for protease-recognition motifs 6 Not a SLiM but a structural motif ",
