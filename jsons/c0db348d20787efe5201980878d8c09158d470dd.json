A new molecular transport media (MTM) preserves released nucleic acid at ambient temperature for later detection. Prospective surveillance was conducted in a Honduran clinic to identify 233 children less than 5 years of age presenting with respiratory symptoms. We obtained 2 nasopharyngeal samples and stored 1 in PrimeStore\u00ae MTM at room temperature and 1 in universal transport media (UTM) at \u221280\u00b0C. The specimens were then transported to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and tested for 16 respiratory viruses using a multiplex PCR panel. The 2 specimen collection systems were similar for detecting the 4 most common viruses: influenza (Kappa = 0.7676, P b 0.0001), human metapneumovirus (Kappa = 0.8770, P b 0.0001), respiratory syncytial virus (Kappa = 0.6849, P b 0.0001), and parainfluenza (Kappa = 0.8796, P b 0.0001). These results suggest that clinical specimens transported via PrimeStore\u00ae MTM and UTM yield similar viral multiplex PCR results.",

Recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 18% of global deaths in children less than 5 are due to pneumonia (Black et al., 2010; Rudan et al., 2008) . Throughout the world, the etiologies of ARIs and pneumonia are largely unknown. It is estimated that 18%-65% of global pediatric patients admitted to the hospital for ARIs and pneumonia are infected with viruses (Arnold et al., 2008; Bonzel et al., 2008; Juven et al., 2000; Tajima et al., 2006; Tsolia et al., 2004) , including influenza. Some data from the tropics and subtropics demonstrate incidence and hospitalization rates for influenza that exceed those reported for temperate regions (Brooks and Steinhoff, 2011; Chiu et al., 2002; Henkle et al., 2011; Nascimento-Carvalho et al., 2008; Zaman et al., 2008) . Several sites in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia have recently added influenza surveillance programs (Higgs et al., 2008; Nair et al., 2011; Yazdanbakhsh and Kremsner, 2009 ) but new technologies, including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for virus detection, are often unavailable in these settings.",

Honduras is classified as a lower middle income country by the World Bank (World Bank, 2013) . The under-five mortality rate per 1000 births is 42.6, and acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in this age group (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2007) .

There is currently 1 WHO National Influenza Center located in the capital of Tegucigalpa, Honduras (Pan-American Health Organization, 2012). One of the most significant difficulties of providing access to advanced diagnostic technologies in a low-resource setting is transport of specimens under adverse conditions. Previous reports show that transport time must be kept to a minimum (less than 1 day) to allow subsequent culture isolation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses (Jensen and Johnson, 1994) . Very little is known about the impact of transit time and temperature on nucleic acid detection by PCR (Druce et al., 2012) . As researchers and clinicians in remote locations begin to utilize RT-PCR and other molecular diagnostic procedures, specimens must be transported in hot, humid climates without freezers or dry ice that are necessary for safe shipment of specimens in universal transport media.",

A recent study found this transport medium to effectively kill viral pathogens, including highly pathogenic H5 influenza virus, and to preserve the nucleic acid at ambient temperatures (Daum et al., 2010) . It is therefore well-suited for potentially infectious biological pathogens that need to be transported with minimal risk or for clinical specimens that require field collection in remote areas such as Honduras. Because mortality rates for acute respiratory infections in resource-limited countries far exceed those of economically developed countries (Cashat-Cruz et al., 2005; Nair et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2002) , information about burden of these pathogens in the resource-limited countries is crucial for the development of effective prevention, surveillance, and treatment strategies. Effective technologies for transporting infectious agents from remote locations to advanced diagnostic laboratories are therefore necessary. The objective of our study was to compare PrimeStore\u00ae MTM at room temperature to universal transport media (UTM) shipped on dry ice in the detection of respiratory viruses in rural Honduran children less than 5 years of age.",

The Clinica Hombro a Hombro is located approximately 6-8 hours away from the nearest dry ice facility in San Pedro Sula. The transport of infectious materials may therefore be compromised during this and other similar travel. However, our study demonstrated comparable results for MTM and UTM. These results remained similar despite lengthy storage time periods for the specimens (mean 116.9 days). We suspect that the statistically significant correlation between results from MTM and UTM reflects the careful monitoring of transport conditions of our specimens. As the principal investigator and other research personnel transported the specimens personally, we were able to guarantee appropriate storage of the specimens until arrival at CCHMC. This degree of monitoring is not feasible for routine transport of specimens. There are several limitations to this pilot study. Though it would be helpful to individually characterize and compare the Luminex signals from each storage medium, we were unable to compare these values via Luminex due to differing aliquot sizes. We were also unable to standardize storage times for our specimens, as samples were transported to CCHMC approximately once every 3 months. Our study would benefit from a larger sample size, as there were relatively small numbers of specimens positive for each virus. We also hope to add quantitative viral results to future studies to avoid the possibility that discordant results were due to low copies of virus.",
