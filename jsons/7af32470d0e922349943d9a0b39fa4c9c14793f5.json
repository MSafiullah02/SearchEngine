Of 3 herds in this category, the 2 that purchased the greatest number of breeding pigs (9 and 13) from herd SA, were classed as infected. The probability of introducing infected pigs is a function of prevalence of infection in the source herd and the number of introductions.

Samples were not collected from one source, a large breeding company, but the consulting veterinarian indicated that the herd was free from infection (B Munro, personal communication 1988) . Therefore, we believe that introduction of more than 5 pigs from herd SA was causally associated with the risk of isolation of toxigenic P. multocida and that the observed statistical association between introduction of more than 50 pigs from other sources and isolation was a spurious one.",

We were unable, however, to experimentally infect birds under similar conditions at a later date. The reasons for this are not known. It is possible that the birds used were not susceptible to infection because of past exposure to the virus o r that the inoculum used was non-infectious even though virus particles were plentiful. Storage of faeces at -2OoC, however, may have reduced infectivity of the virus.",

It has been assumed that a similar situation applies to wildlife, especially for those animals kept in zoos or sanctuaries. However, before the usefulness of these analyses for the diagnosis of disease can be assessed, reference (normal) values have to be established. Ideally this should be done for each population with a different habitat, but in practice values are extrapolated from one group to another. In the koala, apart from unpublished data available from zoos, limited reference values are available. Two studies have been published for various wild groups from Victoria (Obendorf 1983) and New South Wales (NSW) (Dickens 1975) . In this article reference values are established for a population of free living koalas centred around Port Macquarie on the north coast of NSW. This population is under threat because of urbanisation and a high level of natural occurring disease (Canfield 1987). Consequently the Koala Preservation Society of NSW and local veterinarians are utilising haematological and biochemical analyses for diagnosis and prognosis.",

Venous blood was 324 collected from the forearm and placed in a plain serum tube and a tube containing sequestrene (EDTA). Serum was separated and a peripheral blood film prepared within one hour of collection. The samples were then transported at 4\u00b0C to a laboratory, where they were processed within 12 h of collection. Biochemical testing was done using a Hitachi 737*, a discrete, selective sample oriented analyser. Boehringer Mannheim reagents* were used for all tests except for calcium? and biocarbonatet. Sodium, potassium and chloride analyses involved ion specific electrodes, albumin analysis utilised bromcresol green while total protein analysis involved the Biuret method. Globulins were derived from the difference between total protein and albumin. Enzyme analyses were all performed at 37\u00b0C. Anionic gap was determined by the following formula: (sodium + potassium) -(chloride + biocarbonate). Osmolality was estimated from 2 x (sodium + potassium). Haematological analysis (haematocrit, haemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets) was performed on a Coulter S 880$. A peripheral blood film was stained with Diff Quiks and manually assessed for morphology and leukocycte types.",
