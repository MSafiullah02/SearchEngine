Diarrhea is a multifactorial disease which despite decades of research on the topics, remains the most common cause of deaths in neonatal calves, even though major risk factors that have long been identified, numbers of calves losses due to diarrhea are not declining (Snodgrass et al., 1986). Several enteropathogens were recovered from neonatal calf with diarrhea, their relative prevalence varies geographically but the most common prevalent infections in most areas are Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus, C. Perfringens, Salmonella spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. (Snodgrass et al., 1986, Garc\u00eda et al., 2000).",

Diarrhea-producing E. coli possess colonization antigens or adhesions that enable the bacteria to colonize the small intestines (Chakraborty et al., 2001). The expression of K99 fimbriae (or F5 ETEC) accounts for nearly all cases of ETEC infection found in newborn calves (Jay et al., 2004). A number of diagnostic tests are currently available for detecting ETEC including: Double-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Holley et al., 1984), DNA gene probes specific for genes encoding toxins and adhesions of ETEC (Woodward and Wray, 1990), multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the rapid screening of ETEC toxins (Watterworth et al., 2005), and monoclonal antibody-based co-agglutination test (Varshney et al., 2007).",

While it may be convenient to focus on the principal infectious causes of calf diarrhea, remember that it is generally the result of interaction between a number of related risk factors, (Crouch et al., 2001, Langoni et al., 2004). Many risk factors are involved in etiology of neonatal calf diarrhea including management and environmental factors (Lundborg et al., 2005).

In a study carried out in Egypt and Israel, higher prevalence (23%) was also recorded (Perka et al., 2000). The differences in the prevalence from those previously recorded may be due to variations in region, management conditions and hygienic measures. Diarrhea caused by ETEC is considered the main infectious disease of newborn calves (Mart\u00edn et al., 2003); however, bovine E. coli F5 (K99) seemed to be of minor importance in the investigated population compared with cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infection (Luginb\u00fchl et al., 2005).",

This result coincided with that previously recorded by Barrington et al. (2002) who reported that passively acquired immunity through colostrum, is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea. It was also found that colostral leukocytes obviously contribute to the passive immunity and resistance of the newborn calf against experimental infection by ETEC (Riedel-Caspari, 1993). The sera of the colostrums fed calves had significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against ETEC mainly of IgG1 specificity on the second day of life as compared to those of the milk substitutes. The sera of the colostrums fed calves contained significantly more IgM on days 2 and 5, and slightly more IgA during the first week (Riedel-Caspari and Schmidt, 1991). However, colostral leukocytes in the absence of humoral components of the colostrum were not able to prevent fatal losses in the calves due to natural infection, although their influence on immune responses of the calves was detectable in vitro (Riedel-Caspari et al., 1991). Moreover, the antibody independent complement activities of serum can be increased substantially by feeding colostral whey concentrate to calves during their first days of life (Rokka et al., 2001).",

In the present study, the prevalence of ETEC K99 in calves with mastitic dams did not significantly differ from those with non mastitic ones (P\n = 0.12). This result is supported by Riedel-Caspari (1993) who reported that in calves experimentally infected with ETEC, colostral leukocytes obtained from cows which developed clinical mastitis, showed a marked reduction in the number of shed bacteria. On the other hand, calves directly fed colostrum of mother cows, which had shown infectious mastitis during the dry period before delivery, suffered from diarrhea possibly induced by a pathogenic strain of E. coli (K99). Also, season was not found to be significantly associated with ETEC K99. This finding may be due to presence of narrow variations in the climatic conditions in the examined areas. On contrary, December and March were recorded to have the highest prevalence (Bendali et al., 1999).",

However, in farms located in Behera, the calves were reared on sandy area and boxes were cleaned daily. The low number of farms in this area and the far distance between farms may explain the lower infection rate.

However, two cases only were recovered from calves raised in semiarid region of Behrra governorate. This result could be due to the system of management of calves, and the nature of environment. The farms located in Behera governorate is a semi arid region. Moreover, the farms were away from other human and animal buildings. This result is supported by that described by Davison et al.
