The 5-year mortality for patients with symptomatic heart failure approaches 50%, and may be as high as 80% at 1 year for the end-stage patients.1 Over the last 4 decades, cardiac transplantation has become the preferred therapy for select patients with end-stage heart disease. Approximately 2400 heart transplants are performed annually in the United States. According to the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation, the median survival of patients after transplantation is currently 10 years, and up to14 years for those surviving the first year (Fig. 1\n), a significant improvement over that of medical therapy for heart failure.2\n",

Intractable ventricular arrhythmias, commonly referred to as \u201cVT storm,\u201d may merit heart transplant evaluation, and often urgent listing, given the association with hemodynamic compromise.

This problem has led to several attempts to investigate monitoring assays, none of which are well validated at present, and there is currently no standard approach to accurately assess the risk for infection in a transplant recipient. However, an immune-monitoring assay (ImmuKnow; Cylex, Columbia, MD) performed on peripheral blood, which measures adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from activated lymphocytes, may offer some guidance in profoundly immunosuppressed patients.60, 61 In the largest study to date in heart transplant recipients, the average T-cell immune function (TCIF) score was significantly lower in patients who developed an episode of infection within 1 month after the measurement, compared with steady-state patients.62 A TCIF score of less than 200 ng ATP/mL was associated with future infection. The authors have used this information to tailor immunosuppression. In a patient with infection, if the TCIF score is less than 200 ng ATP/mL, immunosuppression will be reduced either by decreasing the dose of MMF or by targeting lower drug levels of the calcineurin inhibitor or PSI. If the TCIF score is 200 to 500 ng ATP/mL, the patient has an adequate level of immunosuppression. If the TCIF score is greater than 500 ng ATP/mL, the patient may be under-immunosuppressed and the MMF dose may be increased, or high drug levels of the calcineurin inhibitor or PSI may be targeted.",

In addition, patients are instructed to use sun protection and to establish care with a dermatologist for routine skin examinations.

Immunologic mechanisms are shown in blue; immunosuppressive drugs and their site of action are shown in red. Acute rejection begins with recognition of donor antigens that differ from those of recipient by recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (indirect allorecognition). Donor APCs (carried passively in graft) may also be recognized by recipient T cells (direct allorecognition). Alloantigens carried by APCs are recognized by the TCR-CD3 complex on the surface of the T cell. When accompanied by costimulatory signals between APC and T cells such as B7-CD28, T-cell activation occurs, resulting in activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates transcription factor NF-AT, allowing it to enter the nucleus and bind to promoters of interleukin (IL)-2 and other cytokines. IL-2 activates cell surface receptors (IL-2R), stimulating clonal expansion of T cells (T-helper cells). IL-2, along with other cytokines produced by T-helper cells, stimulates expansion of other cells of the immune system. Activation of IL-2R stimulates target of rapamycin (TOR), which regulates translation of mRNAs to proteins that regulate the cell cycle.
