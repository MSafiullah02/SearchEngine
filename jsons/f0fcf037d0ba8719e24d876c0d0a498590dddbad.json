Ceremonies and Plenaries will be centred on Friday 26th June. Parallel, Policy and Thematic Sessions will generally be scheduled between Thursday 25th June and Saturday 27th June. However, in a flexible response to the unique nature of the coronavirus pandemic, a wider window for sessions is offered extending from Monday 22nd June to Friday 3rd July with further flexibility possible in exceptional cases. \u2022 As usual, only one paper per presenter will be included in the conference programme for Parallel and Thematic Sessions. \u2022 Accepted papers featuring at least one author who is an EAERE member will also be included within an online database with extended search options including by topic and method.

We have now issued online a Call for Papers to address the environmental economics of the coronavirus, details of which are given in the Annex to this Editorial together with a suggested agenda for research questions. As a precursor to this initiative, in this issue of the journal we publish a specially commissioned paper providing what is, to our knowledge, the first assessment of the environmental policy challenges raised by the coronavirus phenomenon. In \"The Environmental Impacts of the Coronavirus\" Dieter Helm sets out an agenda for integrated environmental economic research and policy response. This embraces a range of research challenges including: understanding the drivers and consequences of the short and long-term environmental effects of coronavirus; how to design economic stimuli and investment to deliver an economic recovery which also addresses major ongoing environmental problems such as the climate emergency and biodiversity loss; the consequences of coronavirus for trade and the environment; and possible behavioural changes, their impact upon the environment and the positive and negative welfare effects arising from this.",
