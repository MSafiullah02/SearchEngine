SARS was initially diagnosed based on criteria issued by the WHO6. The hospital records were reviewed following approval of the institutional ethical committee. Additional radiologic and laboratory information were retrieved from the hospital computerized Clinical Management System. Demographic data and symptom profiles were recorded in all patients by a standard form on admission. Chest radiograph was mandatory with supplementary chest computerized-axial tomography (CT) when clinically indicated. Blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate were monitored regularly after admission. Initial laboratory investigations included complete blood count, arterial blood gas, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase, liver, and renal function tests. Serial monitoring of the laboratory profile was performed according to the clinical progress of individual patient. Chest radiograph was taken on alternate days. Either nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasal/throat swabs were taken for CoV testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Paired sera were collected on admission and on day 14 for determination of a fourfold rise of IgG anti-CoV antibodies.",

Hourly 1 L exchange of peritoneal dialysate was performed manually. For blood purification, pump-driven continuous venovenous hemofiltration was used. The replacement solution contained self-admixtured sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solution. Citrate was used for anticoagulation. Calcium chloride was infused through another central line. The hourly ultrafiltration rate was set at 1500 mL and the net ultrafiltration was adjusted by titrating the volume of saline replacement administered via a separate line.",

Cox proportional hazards model was used in the calculation of hazard ratio (relative risk) of mortality and development of ARF for each risk factor. Significant risk factors identified by univariate analyses were further analyzed in multivariate model to identify independent risk factors associated with the development of ARF. Due to a relatively smaller population of SARS patients with ARF as compared with those with normal renal function, risk factors with P value less than 0.01, accompanied with 99% confidence interval, was chosen as statistically significant level unless specified otherwise. The least squares mean plasma creatinine and the time for doubling the plasma creatinine concentration in different groups of SARS with ARF were calculated from prediction polynomial equations of mixed linear model.

The peak plasma creatinine levels ranged from 136 to 1083 \u03bcmol/L, with a median value of 274 \u03bcmol/L. Fourteen of these 36 patients (39%) had plasma bicarbonate lower than 24 mmol/L (normal 24 to 26 mmol/L) prior to or at the time of detection of ARF. Oliguria (urine output <500 mL/day) occurred in half of these 36 patients. Those patients with ARF were older (P <0.001) and had higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.005) than other SARS patients with no ARF.

It should be clarified that identical antibiotic regimes were given to our two groups of SARS patients (with and without ARF). Eosinophilia was not detected in patients with ARF. Despite the fact that ribavirin is predominantly excreted by the kidneys, nephrotoxicity has not been previously reported. In our seven postmortem subjects, we detected no distinct renal pathology and did not find CoV ultrastructurally. However, the ultrastructural interpretation was limited by autolysis of the tissues and a direct involvement of the kidneys by the CoV could not be entirely ruled out. The detection of PCR fragments of CoV in urine from 21% to 50% of SARS patients between the second and third week of the viral infection16 still highlights a possibility of kidney tropism of the CoV. Nevertheless, the normal glomerular histology with absence of electron-dense deposits, mild proteinuria, and absence of active cellular cast all tend to negate the existence of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Moreover, the in situ hybridization study also failed to detect SARS-CoV in kidney tissues and suggested that persistent infection in these fatal cases was less likely.",

As our clinical findings suggest the relative importance of prerenal factors in the development of ARF in these SARS patients, strict precautions should be exercised to ensure that these patients receive adequate hemodynamic support. Hypotension and sepsis must be treated aggressively as the complicating renal impairment is always associated with high mortality.
