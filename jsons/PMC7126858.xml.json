Currently, the standard technique for diagnosis of viral disease and viral quantification is based on cell culture methods requiring two days of culturing in a well-controlled laboratory environment (Otter et al., 2016; van Doremalen et al., 2013). Other viral disease detection methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), both with high sensitivity and specificity (Lee and Zeng, 2017b; Reperant and Osterhaus, 2017), as well as flow cytometry and microscopy (Yang et al., 2017; Zarei, 2018). However, all these methods require expensive equipment and reagents, well-trained operators, and labor-intensive processing, and they are also typically time-consuming (Nasseri et al., 2018) (Table 1). Nevertheless, the ELISA is currently considered a gold standard for protein detection.",

Each integrated LOC platform typically contains sets of microfluidic elements, each of which are dedicated to single operations such as reagent storage, fluid transport, fluid mixing, product detection, and possibly collection. Currently, the systems consist of complex devices with interconnected fluidic microchannel networks, valves, mixers, pumps, reaction chambers, and detectors, and they are able to perform many laborious benchtop protocols without human intervention (Jung et al., 2015b). These abilities make LOCs suitable for applications in clinical diagnostics as well as near-patient or point-of-care (POC) testing (Wang et al., 2017), potentially enabling low-cost mass production.",

Methods based on electron microscopy, cytology, or histology (Storch, 2000) are less common. Currently, serological testing is the mainstay of viral disease diagnostics in clinical laboratories. It enables the monitoring of the immune system's antibody response to viral antigen exposure, both the IgM response representing acute infection, and IgG as a consequence of primary infection or as the response to the acute phase of secondary infections. In this chapter we wrote a brief overview of the selected detection and quantification methods of viruses.",

The viruses are subsequently detected by cytopathic effects, eliciting specific characteristics and alterations in host cells caused by viral invasion (Agol, 2012) (Fig. 1\nA), followed by immunofluorescence staining to its identification. The alternative method based on cell cultures is haemadsorption where the erythrocytes adsorb to the plasma membrane of the virus-infected cell monolayer (Fig. 1B). Cell culturing is a standard technique, but one of its drawbacks is that it takes approximately four weeks, which can be too long for tackling a potential viral disease outbreak (Papafragkou et al., 2013). Therefore, the rapid shell vial culture method was developed (Jayakeerthi et al., 2006). It is based on inoculation of the specimen on to the cell monolayer grown on a cover slip, followed by low-speed centrifugation and detection of the virus by immunofluorescence. However, this rapid culture test cannot target the required range of viruses and it does not possess sufficient sensitivity. Another simple and inexpensive technique is hemagglutination assay, which is based on the detection of the virus via agglutination of erythrocytes (Fig. 1C, upper). This test later led to the hemagglutination inhibition assay (Hierholzer et al., 1969) (Fig. 1C, bottom), a serological approach that detects specific antibodies against viral antigens (Hierholzer et al., 1969). The complement fixation test also introduces a convenient and easy method based on the reaction of the complement with an antigen-antibody complex (Adone et al., 2016).",

            "text": "However, the most conventional techniques mentioned above were later replaced with more sensitive and quantitative immunoassays capable of detecting the virus antigen or antibodies in clinical specimens (Weinberg and Walker, 2005). The high specificity and binding affinity between antigen and antibody generated a number of immunomethods with different detection approaches such as radio-immunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked techniques (EIA), and ELISA. The most commonly used one is RIA, utilizing a radioisotope\u2013labeled antibody to detect antigens or vice versa. As an alternative to danger radioactive labels, the utilization of enzymatic labels such as peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase led to the development of EIA. Currently, EIA variants such as ELISA (Niikura et al., 2001) (Fig. 1E) and chemiluminescent (Azar and Landry, 2018) or microparticle enzyme immunoassay (van den Berk et al., 2003) are widely used due to their high sensitivity. Especially ELISA, due to its dual specificity, became a gold standard for protein detection. Nevertheless, the co-circulation of closely related flaviviruses such as ZIKV and DENV in number of regions makes the conventional detection of a specific virus using immunoassays a complicated task (Wen and Shresta, 2019). Also there is a window period between the viral infection and antibody production resulting in false negative results using immunoassays, which can be up as long as 35\u201345 days for first generation HIV testing (Cornett and Kirn, 2013). The increase sensitivity acquired in fourth generation of immunoassays led to shortening this window to 10\u201315 days (Branson and Stekler, 2011).",

This technology is utilized to fabricate silicon and glass based microfluidic chips or masters for microstructures, followed by substrate etching and wafer bonding. One of the earliest widespread MEMS technology for LOC and microfluidic devices is anodic bonding, wherein micromachined silicon is capped by glass to produce the microfluidic device (Fig. 2\nA) (Qi et al., 2018).

A large number of patterning techniques are developed for the microfabrication of microfluidic devices, such as replica molding, microcontact printing, micromolding in capillaries, hot embossing, and microtransfer molding. For example, the micromolding technique was developed with two approaches involving either liquid or solid materials. A monomer of an elastomer such as PDMS (Karthik et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2012) is poured over a three-dimensional (3D) mask used as the mold and left to cross-link in a vacuum either at room temperature or at an elevated temperature. The mold is typically made of materials such as silicon, metal, or plastic, often produced by lithography (Fig. 2B). Then, the PDMS is separated from the mold, its surface is activated by O2 plasma, and then it is bonded to the glass substrate (Haubert et al., 2006). Another popular technique for fabricating microfluidic chips, called hot embossing (Fig. 2C), involves the use of hard materials. It can be wafer-based using a silicon wafer with a 3D surface pattern or a roll-to-roll using nickel or steel patterns to press against the substrate such as COC, PC, or PMMA. This roll-to-roll hot embossing technique is suitable for the large-scale production of microfluidic chips with a throughput of over 250,000 chips per day per line (Peng et al., 2016).",

The cutters are often capable of fabricating structures with feature sizes as small as \u2248 20 \u03bcm. Unfortunately, in spite of its potential, xurography has not yet been fully utilized to fabricate microfluidic devices for virus detection.",

The methods for paper-based device fabrication are fully developed forming channels originally performed by printing (Carrilho et al., 2009). The paper surface properties can be modified by formation of hydrophilic patterns on a hydrophobic membrane with plasma (Li et al., 2008) or laser treated surface (Chitnis et al., 2011). Another technique was employed to form superhydrophobic properties using polyhydroxybutyrate (Obeso et al., 2013). The paper-based microfluidics can be also direct cut with a laser or cutting plotter, printing with wax or biomolecules forming microchannel and test zones, mask-based fabrication, such as photolithography and wet etching, and screen-printing. Those methods are utilized to fabricate single layer paper devices, also allowed to form 3D devices by stacking papers such as origami (Liu and Crooks, 2011), even in easily reconfigurable configuration (Kong et al., 2017). As of now, paper-based devices do not have sufficient sensitivity, so further research and development in this area as well as in the implementation of suitable functionalization and immobilization of biomolecules (Yamada et al., 2017) is required. Paper-based detection, such as lateral flow strips (LFS), serve as qualitative diagnosis caused by the low precision of colorimetric device both for nucleic acids and proteins. The results are influenced by different lighting conditions and the variation in the color perception of users. In order to achieve quantitative analysis in paper-based diagnostics, commercial strip readers and color sensors have been used to record the color intensity, followed by the use of image-processing and analyzing software.",

The device represents a continuous flow design with cross-flow filtration configuration to achieve large volume and high processing speed. Approximately 50% of influenza viruses were physically isolated in \u224830 min in the pSiNWs forest. The viruses could be released through degradation on the pSiNWs forest in \u224824 h (Wu et al., 2017). A sample preparation platform was developed that used a spiral inertial microfluidic device with continuous circulation to separate host cells from viral particles and free NAs. Removal with this device led to the reduction in human (host) background reads in metagenomic sequencing for viral detection and sequencing (Choi et al., 2018). Another approach for separating the sample is dielectrophoresis (DEP). It is implemented in microfluidic chips and used to capture DENV. The mechanism of detection involves the use of the DEP force to capture the modified beads in the microfluidic chip and the DENV modified with the fluorescence label, as the detection target can be captured on the modified beads by immunoreaction (Iswardy et al., 2017). Aptamers and antibodies are used for heterogeneous cell separation (Lin et al., 2016). An aptamer-based sandwich system was developed to capture and detect rare cells on a chip. An acoustic microfluidic device was developed for DENV cell separation from mammalian cells (Fong et al., 2014), with an efficiency of \u224870% using sample flow rate of \u2248100 mL min\u22121.",

            "text": "Bead-based immunofluorescence assay on microfluidic chips is widely being used for virus detection (Zhang et al., 2013). The DEP module was integrated into a microfluidic chip to detect DENV with fluorescence immunosensing (Iswardy et al., 2017). The platform provided rapid on-chip detection in \u22485 min with a small sample volume of \u224815 \u03bcL and life-time reusability of >50 \u00d7 . Also, an automated magnetic bead-based microfluidic ELISA method for detection of HIV-1 based on p24 capsid antigen detection was developed (Fig. 3C) (Coarsey et al., 2019). The developed platform provided a free-flow design, with no syringe pumps, and accepted target values as low as \u2248 20 pg mL\u22121 and middle range target values of \u224860 pg mL\u22121 (Fig. 3D) (Chunduri et al., 2016). Typically, the reagent flow is induced by an external force and controlled by either integrated or external valves. Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (\u03bcPADs) have microporous structures that allow efficient absorption and sample flow without any peripheral force. Therefore, they provide an attractive alternative to traditional laboratory-based assays and allow affordable and rapid disease testing. Recently, \u03bcPADs for immunoassay were developed for the detection of the DENV and ZIKV via viral nonstructural glycoprotein 1 (NS1) in \u22487 min from samples containing \u2248 10 ng mL\u22121 of viral protein in the blood and plasma. The device consists of a large area at the top for sample collection either directly from blood or from plasma, followed by coating of the area with specific antibodies against both the DENV and ZIKV's NS1 protein (Bedin et al., 2017) using a custom-made application on a smartphone for results reading. A paper-based microfluidic dot ELISA chip was fabricated to detect influenza A (Wu et al., 2017). The chip consists of two modules: the first one is the reagent storage and dispensing module, and the second one is the reaction module with an absorbent pad and functionalized nitrocellulose membrane for influenza A detection.",

Although it is a relatively fast device, the sample preparation was not integrated with the real-time PCR system. Nevertheless, this system was demonstrated to be capable of performing qPCR multiplexing using a single fluorescent channel, either by combining an FAM probe and an intercalating dye (Ahrberg and Neu\u017eil, 2015) or using only an intercalating dye (Ahrberg et al., 2015).",

The design of the microfluidic device typically predetermines the number of temperature cycling steps. Their duration can be then adjusted by variation of the flow rate or sample motion. Sample circulating systems offer more flexibility in cycle duration, number, and ratio (Pipper et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2007). A system incorporated with a disposable microfluidic chip can be produced in large volumes using cost-effective roll-to-roll embossing methods such as the one for detection of the Ebola virus (Fern\u00e1ndez-Carballo et al., 2018). The chip has a long microfluidic channel that directs the PCR solution through areas heated to different temperatures. The solution first enters the zone with temperatures between \u224850\u00b0C and \u224857\u00b0C where the RNA is converted to cDNA and subsequently amplified by PCR while the amplification product is detected in real time by an optical fluorescence sensing system.",

Endpoint detection requires less complex instrumentation and provides simpler outputs for interpretation. Real-time methods integrate amplification with detection and are superior for quantitative analyte detection having a larger dynamic range. Alternative methods are developed for NA amplification detection, such as optical, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, and nanomaterials-based detection. Fluorescence detection is the most popular optical detection strategy in biosensing caused by the advantages of sensitivity and selectivity, was developed in an integrated low cost unit (Novak et al., 2007). Fluorescence detection performed by fluorescent probes or beacons, and intercalating fluorescence dye, could be utilized for both real-time and endpoint detection. An integrated real-time fluorescence hand-held system was first developed to perform a detection of RNA of H5N1 avian influenza virus using real-time RT-PCR (Neuzil et al., 2010), later on upgraded into a palm-size device employed for detect the RNA of Ebola virus (Ahrberg et al., 2016b). Both systems utilized light-emitting diodes with a principal wavelength of \u2248490 nm to excite the fluorophore and photodiodes to detect the emission. The output signal from the photodiodes was processed by a lock-in amplifier to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This handheld device (Fig. 5\nA) was further applied to provide an internet of things platform for infection disease diagnosis verified by DENV (Zhu et al., 2020). A similar platform was also developed as a modular system (Neuzil et al., 2014) capable to perform both time and space domain PCR for NA, localized surface plasmon resonance for protein detection (Neuzil and Reboud, 2008), electrochemical sensing using an array of two electrode systems and also using nanowires as biosensors.",

A fully integrated paper-based LAMP device with an LFS layer (Fig. 5E) was utilized to detect DENV (Choi et al., 2016). They immobilized gold nanoparticles and detect probe conjugates on a nitrocellulose membrane for the LFS layer to capture target amplicons.

A designed detection probe was utilized in a 200 \u03bcL reaction tube to detect HCV using RT-LAMP by monitoring hydrogen ions concentration change (Fig. 5F). The probe comprises an ion sensitive field effect transistor, a micro-capillary based Ag/AgCl/KCl reference electrode and a temperature sensor (Jogezai and Shabbir, 2018). The electrical conductivity of the solution is also one parameter for the NA amplification test of the electrochemical method. The sample electrical conductivity is influenced by accumulate non-precipitated magnesium pyrophosphate and protons due to the consumption of primers and dNTPs during amplification process. A cellulose paper with printed graphene-modified silver electrodes (Fig. 5G) was used for the electrical conductivity measurement integrated with LAMP for HIV detection (Safavieh et al., 2017). The reduction in the sample electrical conductivity is correlated to the concentration of the target nucleic acid resulting in both qualitative and quantitative detection.",

An external electronic control system for temperature cycling required to conduct PCR. The sample is loaded by a vacuum inside the chambers, the RT-PCR is conducted and then the product is loaded onto an area with hybridization probes. The results are read by a florescence camera system and the diagnosed RNA/DNA is determined from the captured fluorescent pattern. The company CEO's philosophy was to conduct only RT-PCR as it can amplify both RNA as well as the DNA and there is only one protocol, making the system operation simpler. Based on this philosophy, various RNA/DNA kits were developed (Tan et al., 2014). Each device has its own bar code linked to the system database for device history tracking.",

This user-friendly system can be modified to perform ELISA with fluorescent optical detection, bringing the cost per test down to a reasonable level. These diagnostic kits will be available in a ready-to-use format and not do it yourself. Palm-sized RT-PCR systems for RNA detention have already been developed (Ahrberg et al. 2016a, 2016b) as well as complex stationary sample-answer systems based on RT-PCR (Nash et al., 2017). We envision the miniaturization of sample preparation followed by RT-PCR for viral RNA diagnosis. However, the sample volume needed to be processed for diseases with a low viral load, such as HIV, prevents the sample from being directly processed by LOC. This problem can be solved by adding a sample pre-concentration step (Pipper et al., 2007) where the viruses or the RNA from a volume of tens or hundreds of \u03bcL will be concentrated to a few \u03bcL and then processed by the LOC system. This would be ideally performed in a touch-free manner to avoid possible contamination of the person handling the blood, which would be irrelevant if the infected person were handling his/her own sample. Nevertheless, minimal human intervention is essential, and thus the development should lead to a sample-to-answer system.",

Connecting all these diagnostic systems with centers and large data-processing facilities will form a true IoT (Zhu et al., 2020) for healthcare authorities. User-friendly software for data acquisition and analysis can be developed using Android or different operating systems to increase public safety. The LOC technology for POC assays is moving towards speed and efficiency in the diagnosis of viral diseases. Portability, cost, automation, speed, efficiency, and connectivity are critical technical parameters for the future generation of LOCs in viral disease diagnosis.",
