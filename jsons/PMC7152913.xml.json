As of March 25, 2020, a total of 81,846 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and 3,287 Chinese died from the disease. Internationally, sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in 193 countries (such as 69,176 cases in Italy, 42,058 cases in Spain, and 53,588 cases in United States), 5 continents, and 1 international conveyance (712 cases in \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d) (World Health Organization, 2020a). On January 23, Wuhan city closed all access routes to stop the spread of disease. Seven days later, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (World Health Organization, 2020b). On March 11, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak could be characterized as a \u201cpandemic\u201d as the virus spreads increasingly worldwide.",

In January 20, China confirmed human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 and some medical staff in Wuhan had been infected (XINHUANET, 2020). Since then, the public has shown anxiety-related behaviors, causing a significant shortage of medical masks and alcohol across the country. On the night of January 31, due to a news that \u201cShuanghuanglian oral liquid\u201d could suppress COVID-19 (People's daily of China, 2020), the public rushed to pharmacies overnight to buy this drug. In addition, many front-line medical staff work more than 16 hours a day on average, causing them to not getting enough sleep. Unfortunately, a 37-year-old Japanese government worker who was in charge of isolated returnees from Wuhan was found to have died from apparent suicide (The Japan Times, 2020).",

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorders were the most prevalent long-term psychological condition (Mak et al., 2009). Similar results have been reported in the previous study of MERS (Lee et al., 2018).

In addition, we assessed the average time participants spent focusing on the COVID-19 outbreak each day, and found that people who spent too much time thinking about the outbreak (\u2265 3 hours) were more likely to develop anxiety symptoms.

Meanwhile, most healthcare workers in China have returned to work to cope with the further development of the disease. Our findings showed that nearly one in four healthcare workers had sleep problems, which was significantly higher than other occupational groups. One possible reason is that the working time and labour intensity of healthcare workers will increase in the face of severe epidemic (such as SARS and MERS), causing them not to have enough time to rest, and to be prone to chronic stress and psychological distress (Lu et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2018; McAlonan et al., 2007).

However, there is still lack of relevant research on the targeted intervention of the public's psychological problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. We filled this research gap by analyzing the prevalence of mental health burden in Chinese public stratified by demographic characteristics and exploring related influential factors. Several appropriate interventions are recommended as follows: First, psychological interventions should be directed to vulnerable populations which include the suspected and diagnosed patients, young people, and healthcare workers, especially physicians and nurses working directly with patients or quarantined people. Second, try to control and limited the time of receiving COVID-19 related information within two hours a day, focus only on the necessary information (such as facts and data) and avoid receiving too many harmful rumors (Grein et al., 2000). Third, maintain a normal rhythm of work and rest as much as possible, exercise regularly to promote sleep quality, and do not pay too much attention to outbreak information before going to sleep.",
