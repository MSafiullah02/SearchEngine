The aim of this study was to survey nursing students' Middle East respiratory syndrome-related knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception to examine the correlations among the variables during a Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. Background. Middle East respiratory syndrome is a new viral respiratory illness. Nursing students who engage in clinical practice at hospitals may have been exposed to Middle East respiratory syndrome infection during the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. Design. This study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. Methods. Participants (n = 249) were nursing students in their third or fourth year of the programme who were engaged in clinical practice for eight hours per day at the tertiary hospitals with Middle East respiratory syndrome patients. Knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception related to Middle East respiratory syndrome were measured using scales developed through a preliminary survey and validity testing. Results. The subjects' knowledge level of Middle East respiratory syndrome was 84\u00c14%; their practice of preventive behaviours was rated at 44\u00c15%; and their risk perception rating was 2\u00c14 out of 5. Middle East respiratory syndrome-related risk perception was significantly different according to gender and Middle East respiratory syndrome education. Middle East respiratory syndrome-related knowledge was significantly correlated with preventive behaviours and risk perception. Conclusion. Considering the low scores for items regarding knowledge and preventive behaviours, it is necessary to develop effective and systematic publicity and education programmes for nursing students. Enhancing Middle East respiratory syndrome-related knowledge by considering cooperation between hospitals and universities will sharpen nursing students' risk perception of the disease and effectively increase their preventive behaviours. Relevance to clinical practice. Similar to other emerging infectious diseases, Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks may occur in other countries. The results of this study can be used to develop and apply efficient and feasible Middle East respiratory syndrome education programmes for nursing students during Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "\u2022 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new viral respiratory illness and nursing students in clinical rotations at hospitals with MERS-infected patients may have been at risk for infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "\u2022 The nursing students' knowledge level of MERS was 84\u00c14%; their practice of preventive behaviours was rated at 44\u00c15%; and their risk perception rating was 2\u00c14 out of five; MERS related knowledge was significantly correlated with preventive behaviours and risk perception.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "\u2022 The results about such a new infectious disease are meaningful as basic information for improving nursing students' nursing education and nursing practice and may be reflected in clinical practice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new viral respiratory illness, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Centers for Disease Control [CDC] 2015) .

However, the attitudes of nursing students towards emerging infectious diseases varied according to gender (Tam et al. 2007 ). The number of male subjects in this study was small; therefore, studies with increased sample sizes that reflect cultural and national characteristics should be conducted in the future. In this study, MERS-related knowledge was significantly correlated with preventive behaviours and risk perception. This finding was partially consistent with previous reports in which there was a significant positive correlation between MERS-related knowledge and risk perception (Gautret et al. 2013 , Khan et al. 2014 ) and similar to a report in which SARS-related risk perception, knowledge and behaviour were correlated with one another (Brug et al. 2004 ).

This lack of education may also be a problem in other countries (Choi & Yang 2010 , Mitchell et al. 2014 . Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as MERS can occur anytime; because of this, infection prevention guidelines should be included in the curriculum of nursing students who have clinical rotations in hospital settings. Practical education programs such as correct handwashing, masking and environmental decontamination methods for improving clinical practice should be included along with theory education that includes MERS transmission, treatment and diagnosis. These educational system changes should be preceded by nursing educators' efforts and reforms (Choi & Yang 2010) .
