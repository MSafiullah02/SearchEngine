The authors state that pharmacological inhibition of classical RAS could have two simultaneous and incompatible outcomes. On the one hand, it will decrease the proinflammatory effect of Angiotensin II with its subsequent benefit on decreasing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) observed in these patients, and on the other hand, it will increase ACE2 expression and therefore the virulence of SARS-Cov2.",

Non-classical RAS is a counter-regulatory system of the classical RAS in that its end product, Angiotensin(1-7), which after binding to the Mas receptor, presents important antiinflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-fibrotic, natriuretic and vasodilator effects [5] , actions completely opposed to those promoted by the end product of the classical RAS Angiotensin II.",
