The vast majority of these bacteria are harmless. However, when an individual is infected by an enteric bacterial pathogen, these microorganisms grow and reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract, and they are shed in the fecal material. Because the enteric bacteria are well-adapted to the conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract, which include high organic carbon concentrations, low pH, and a relatively high temperature (~ 37\u00b0C), they tend to have a relatively difficult time growing in the environment. This is because the conditions in soil, water, etc. are generally very different from those in the gastrointestinal tract: nutrients are generally present in low concentrations and/or in difficult-to-metabolize forms, the temperature is not optimal for growth, the moisture content is lower, etc. As a result, the enteric bacteria typically do not compete well with the indigenous soil or water bacteria for the available nutrients. This adversely affects their ability to reproduce, or even survive without reproducing, in the environment. Thus, their longevity in the external environment is typically limited to a few days to weeks, depending on the environmental conditions.",

In general, many of the bacteria pathogens are relatively easy to remove through wastewater and drinking water treatment processes, and, therefore, are of less concern than the other groups of pathogens in many industrialized countries. However, these pathogens are still of great concern in many of the less-industrialized countries, due to the lack of adequate sanitary treatment processes in those countries.

Enteric viruses are very different from enteric bacteria in a number of ways. Some of the most important differences in this context are:\u2022Viruses are nonliving. They can only reproduce inside of susceptible host cells, as they use the host's biochemical mechanisms to reproduce themselves.\u2022Viruses are relatively more host-specific than bacteria. Thus, many viruses are only able to infect a single species or a few species. This can make it easier to identify the source of contamination. For example, if a human-specific virus is found in water, it is clear that the water has been contaminated by human fecal material.\u2022Because viruses are metabolically inert when outside of a host cell, they are not affected as much as bacteria by the presence of nutrients in the external environment. As they cannot reproduce in the environment, their numbers can only decrease over time.\u2022Viruses are typically able to survive for longer periods in the environment, compared to bacteria. Typically, viruses can survive for weeks to months; survival has even been reported for 2 years in a cold groundwater.\u2022Viruses are much smaller than bacteria. The typical enteric virus is 25\u201380 nm in size, while the typical size of an enteric bacterium is 1\u20132 mm.

This is an extremely diverse group of organisms, the common feature of which is that they live on or in a host organism and obtain their food from or at the expense of the host. The enteric parasites that are pathogenic to humans can be classified into two groups: the protozoa (sometimes referred to as the protists) and the helminths, which include the intestinal worms. Protozoa are single-celled microorganisms whose life cycles include at least one vegetative as well as at least one resting stage. The infective stage of the protozoa is different for different parasites. In the case of Cryptosporidium, the resting oocyst form must be ingested to initiate infection; for others, the vegetative form must be ingested for infection to occur. The resting stage of the organism (cyst, ovum) is generally relatively resistant to inactivation from environmental stresses and during conventional drinking and wastewater treatment processes. Thus, those parasites whose resting stage is the infective stage may be of greater concern than those whose infective form is the vegetative stage, even for consumers of (inadequately) treated water.",

This characteristic can be shown directly through conducting epidemiological studies in which the association between the indicators and health outcomes are assessed. A different, more common, and generally less expensive way to demonstrate the correlation between indicators and health risk is to monitor water for the presence and/or concentration of pathogen and compare those data to data on potential indicator microorganisms. While the latter approach might be simpler and less expensive, it may be more problematic. This is because most pathogen detection methods detect a single pathogen or closely related group of pathogens, and a correlation (or lack thereof) between an indicator and a single pathogen or pathogen group does not infer that a correlation exists (or does not exist) with other waterborne pathogens. To obtain complete and accurate information regarding the potential for an indicator to provide information on the microbiological safety of the water, correlations for each pathogenic microorganism or related group of microorganism would need to be examined.",
