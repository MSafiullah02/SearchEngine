Also, an enrichment of gene expression in brain tissues has been observed for many of the genes in our network, including OLIG2, NRXN1 and DLG4 (Fig 3D) . We then used the lookup tab to search relative gene expression changes of the network of genes across different schizophrenia transcriptional datasets (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) . Several figures and tables are displayed, most importantly a heatmap of log2 fold change values and table of gene expression changes across the different datasets (Fig 4A, Supplementary Table 2) . The results indicate a clear dysregulation in expression for our network of genes, consistent with previous findings of their association with schizophrenia (43) (44) (45) . Also, a correlation matrix figure is shown based on the list of the genes from the DISC1 network and paired based on the selected datasets (Fig 4B) . Finally, the iLINCS tab was utilized to search for knockdown signatures of the list of genes from the network and generate a table of signature IDs, cell line, and direct link to the signature iLINCS webpage for further exploration (Supplementary Table 3 ).",

            "text": "As demonstrated here, Kaleidoscope provides an integrated platform to perform in silico data exploration of transcriptional signatures. The ability to efficiently explore DISC1 related signatures across all of these databases and tools offers insights on its protein-protein interactors and their regulation patterns across schizophrenia transcriptional datasets. Kaleidoscope has been recently utilized to perform in silico replication analyses of publicly available datasets, highlighting its utility (5-8). Our platform was used to supplement findings of bioenergetic gene expression dysregulation, and to explore adenosine system dysregulation in schizophrenia (5, 6) . It was also used to explore abnormal regulators of protein prenylation in schizophrenia (7) . Most recently, Kaleidoscope was utilized to investigate alteration of glutamate transporter interacting proteins in schizophrenia, major depression, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (8) . Taken together, these examples show the advantage of having a platform that streamlines the process of in silico data exploration, making bioinformatics tools accessible to a wider range of users to test and investigate scientific questions and findings in silico. Starting with hypotheses and questions, Kaleidoscope integrates multiple platforms and tools to streamline the process of in silico data exploration. STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes) provides protein-protein interaction networks. The Brain RNASeq database is used for cell specific gene expression levels in human and mouse brain tissues. BrainCloud is used to extract gene expression patterns in the brain across the lifespan of healthy humans. Enrichr is integrated to perform gene set enrichment analyses. iLINCS (Integrative Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures) is queried to search for gene knockdown transcriptional signatures and generate L1000 signatures that can be further explored using the iLINCS platform. BrainAtlas is used to assess gene expression levels in different brain cell types. GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) is used to explore tissue specific gene expression patterns. GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) is utilized to extract and curate previously published differential gene expression datasets. GWAS Catalog (Genome-Wide Association Study Catalog) is searched for previously published genome-wide association studies. The GeneShot tool is used to text mine published studies to associate search terms and genes.",

            "text": "The curated datasets cover several substrates, including stem cells, postmortem brain, and animal models. At present the application has over 200 datasets grouped under different modules. The modules currently available are schizophrenia, depression, antipsychotics, dopamine signaling, insulin signaling, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, aging, microcystin, and coronavirus. These modules are also being expanded as we integrate additional datasets. In addition, users have the ability to upload their own curated datasets into the application, thus expanding the different diseases hosted in the platform. Loaded datasets are automatically harmonized by calculating the empirical cumulative probabilities of the log2 fold change values of genes within each dataset(20).Kaleidoscope displays the results for this section of the software across multiple tabs. The \"Results\" tab shows a table where each row represent a gene from the input list of genes and each column represent a dataset from the selected datasets. The values in the table are the log2 fold-change values and p-values. The \"Lookup Graph\" tab shows a figure to visualize the results from the table from the \"Results\" tab with additional information to help the user quickly navigate the results. The x-axis of the figure represents genes and the y-axis represents proportion values of number of \"hits,\" log2 fold change values that passed a cutoff threshold which can be adjusted by the user. These values represent the number of hits over the number of datasets for each target gene, excluding datasets that have missing values. The colors represent the number of datasets which are found for each gene. The \"Heatmap\" tab displays an interactive heatmap representing log2 fold change values (Log2FC), fold change values (FC), and standardized scores based on the calculations of empirical cumulative probabilities (ECDF). These heatmaps provide unsupervised hierarchical clustering for both genes and datasets. The clustering allows patterns of similar changes of expression across the list of genes and the datasets that were selected to be identified. The \"Correlation\" tab in this section shows a visualization of the concordance scores matrix calculated using either Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis based on the log2 fold change values. The user has the option to calculate the concordance scores based on the input list of genes or the full list of genes in the datasets. For each correlation analysis between two datasets, the test is applied using only the genes that were found in both datasets. The colors on the figure denotes the direction of the concordance scores, where red represents negative correlation (high discordance) and blue represents positive correlation (high concordance). The \"References\" tab shows a table with brief descriptions of each dataset and their references. Alternatively, instead of inputting a list of genes, the user has the option to query the commonly differentially expressed genes across multiple datasets by sorting the list of genes based on their absolute log2 fold change values within each dataset and extracting the top list of genes. An additional tab is shown when the user selects this type of analysis; it displays a heatmap representing the overlapping hits across the queried datasets. The user can adjust the parameters of this analysis by selecting the desired number of extracted genes from the datasets and the final number of genes that have the most overlap across the selected datasets.",
