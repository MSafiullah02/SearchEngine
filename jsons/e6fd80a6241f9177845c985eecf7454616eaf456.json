            "text": "Indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 inhibitor widely used in the clinic for its potent antiinflammatory/analgesic properties, possesses antiviral activity against several viral pathogens; however, the mechanism of antiviral action remains elusive. We have recently shown that indomethacin activates the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) in human colon cancer cells. Because of the important role of PKR in the cellular defence response against viral infection, herein we investigated the effect of indomethacin on PKR activity during infection with the prototype rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus. Indomethacin was found to activate PKR in an interferon-and dsRNA-independent manner, causing rapid (< 5 min) phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 \u03b1-subunit (eIF2\u03b1). These events resulted in shutting off viral protein translation and blocking viral replication (IC 50 = 2 \u03bcM) while protecting host cells from virusinduced damage. Indomethacin did not affect eIF2\u03b1 kinases PKR-like endoplasmic reticulumresident protein kinase (PERK) and general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) kinase, and was unable to trigger eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in the presence of PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine. In addition, small-interfering RNA-mediated PKR gene silencing dampened the antiviral effect in indomethacin-treated cells. The results identify PKR as a critical target for the antiviral activity of indomethacin and indicate that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation could be a key element in the broad spectrum antiviral activity of the drug.",

PKR is encoded from a single gene located on human chromosome 2p21-22, and contains a C-terminal kinase domain (KD) shared by three other mammalian kinases: the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein kinase (PERK or PEK), the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) and the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) kinase, all of which phosphorylate the \u03b1-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) in response to stress signals (Schneider and Mohr, 2003; Baltzis et al., 2004; Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005; Taylor et al., 2005) . The multiprotein complex eIF2 is responsible for recruiting the initiator Met-tRNA Met to the 40S ribosomal subunit in a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent manner (Clemens, 2004; Gebauer and Hentze, 2004; Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005) . Phosphorylation of the eIF2 \u03b1-subunit (eIF2\u03b1) at residue Ser51 functions as a dominant inhibitor of guanine exchange factor eIF2B and prevents the recycling of GTP on eIF2 that is required for ongoing translation, thus leading to general inhibition of protein synthesis (Clemens, 2004; Taylor et al., 2005) .",

In uninfected non-stressed cells, PKR is found in a monomeric latent state due to the auto-inhibitory effect of its dsRBDs, which normally occlude the KD (Garc\u00eda et al., 2006) . Upon binding to dsRNA produced as a virus replication intermediate, PKR undergoes homo-dimerization and autophosphorylation on Thr446 and Thr451, leading to substrate docking, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and block of protein synthesis in virally infected cells (Taylor et al., 2005; Dabo and Meurs, 2012) . dsRNA-induced PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation represents a primary antiviral response in mammalian cells (Schneider and Mohr, 2003; Garc\u00eda et al., 2006) ; in fact production of dsRNA is an obligate part of the genomic replication cycle for RNA viruses as RNA serves as a template for both viral transcription and replication, and dsRNA is often produced by opposing transcription units also during DNA virus replication (Schneider and Mohr, 2003) .",

When viral proteins begin to accumulate, progeny viral genomes are replicated and used for secondary transcription. mRNA from both primary and secondary transcription are similar in structure to host messengers, containing a cap at the 5\u2032-end and a 3\u2032-poly(A) tail similar in length to host mRNAs (Connor and Lyles, 2002; Lyles et al., 2013) .

Since the initial discovery in the 1960s (Inglot, 1969) , in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the antiviral activity of indomethacin against several human viral pathogens, including herpes virus (Zhu et al., 2002) , rotavirus (Rossen et al., 2004) , hepatitis B (Bahrami et al., 2005) , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Ramirez et al., 1986; Bourinbaiar and Lee-Huang, 1995) and the SARS-CoV coronavirus, agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Amici et al., 2006) . The experimental and clinical evidence accumulated suggests a novel therapeutic use of this classical anti-inflammatory drug during viral infection; however, the lack of understanding of the mechanism of antiviral action is a major drawback for INDO treatment of viral diseases. Indomethacin ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses points out to a host-mediated antiviral mechanism, rather than an effect on virus-specific enzymes; however, this mechanism remains largely unknown.",

We demonstrate that INDO acts at the translational level by rapidly inducing the phosphorylation of the \u03b1-subunit of eIF2. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 occurs at concentrations of INDO in the C max range detected in patients treated with medium-high doses of the drug (Benet, 1996) . Confirming our previous observation in cancer cells (Brunelli et al., 2012) , eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was found to be mediated by selective activation of PKR.

In addition, pretreatment of MA104 cells with INDO (400 \u03bcM) for a 6 h period only modestly affected VSV replication, if the drug was removed before viral infection ( Supplementary Fig.  S5 ). The effect of indomethacin on VSV protein synthesis and localization was then analysed. In a first set of experiments, mock-infected or VSV-infected (10 PFU per cell) MA104 cells were treated with INDO after the 1 h adsorption period and, at 6 h p.i., viral proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-VSV antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 , the expression of high levels of cytoplasmic viral proteins at 6 h p.i. was accompanied by a nearly complete disassembly of tubulin filaments in the cytoplasm of infected cells; viral proteins were instead barely detectable in INDO-treated cells, which were indistinguishable from uninfected controls for size and cytoskeletal arrangement. To investigate the effect of INDO on cellular and viral protein synthesis, mock-infected and VSV-infected cells were treated with INDO after virus adsorption and labelled with [ 35 S]-methionine at 4 h p.i. for the next 4 h. Samples containing equal amounts of pro- teins or equal amounts of radioactivity were processed for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3A , INDO treatment strongly inhibited VSV protein expression and prevented the virus-induced shut-off of cellular protein synthesis. Next, the effect of INDO on the kinetics of VSV protein synthesis was analysed. Mockinfected and VSV-infected cells were treated with 400 \u03bcM INDO after virus adsorption and labelled with [ 35 S]methionine (1 h pulse) at different times p.i. Indomethacin was found to cause a transient (1-6 h) inhibition of [ 35 S]-methionine incorporation into proteins in both mockinfected and VSV-infected cells (Fig. 3B ). Samples containing the same amount of radioactivity were processed for SDS-PAGE, autoradiography and densitometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C , accumulation of VSV proteins was evident starting at 3 h p.i., whereas shut-off of host cell protein synthesis was observed at later times (4-5 h) p.i. In infected cells, INDO treatment was confirmed to strongly inhibit VSV protein expression and to prevent the virusinduced shut-off of cellular protein synthesis up to 6-8 h p.i. (Fig. 3C ). It should be pointed out that the synthesis of VSV proteins, in particular the N protein, could be detected starting at 6 h p.i. in INDO-treated cells.",

To establish whether INDO was affecting virus protein expression at transcriptional or translation level, total viral RNA and primary transcript levels were determined by Northern blot analysis in infected cells at 4 h p.i. Viral primary transcript accumulation was obtained by blocking viral protein synthesis (which is essential for viral replication and amplification of viral secondary transcripts) with cycloheximide treatment (50 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ) started 30 min prior to viral infection. The fact that INDO did not significantly affect VSV primary transcription, whereas it dramatically reduced VSV total RNA levels ( Fig. 5A) , suggested an effect on viral mRNA translation. A translational block was in fact demonstrated by polysome profile analysis after cell extracts sucrose gradient fractionation. As shown in Fig. 5B , INDO caused a rapid and substantial decrease of heavier polysomes, characteristic of a reduced rate of translation initiation, in both mock-infected and VSVinfected cells at 30 min p.i. As indicated earlier, translational inhibition was transient as demonstrated by protein synthesis recovery at later times after treatment (Fig. 3B) .",

The effect of INDO on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was then investigated in MA104 cells. Mock-infected and VSV-infected cells were treated with different concentrations of INDO, and levels of Ser51phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) were determined after 30 min. As shown in Fig. 6A , INDO was found to potently induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation starting at concentrations in the low micromolar range in mock-infected cells. In VSV-infected cells, INDO treatment induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM, concomitantly with a substantial decrease in viral yield (see Fig. 1A ). eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was a very rapid event starting as soon as 5 min after drug administration and attenuating between 4 and 6 h after treatment (Fig. 6B) , concomitantly with the release of protein synthesis inhibition (see Fig. 3B ).

We have recently shown that INDO treatment selectively activates PKR in a cyclooxygenase-independent manner in human colon cancer cells (Brunelli et al., 2012) . To confirm that PKR is the kinase responsible for INDOinduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also in MA104 cells, GCN2, PERK, HRI and PKR kinase activities were analysed in MA104 whole-cell lysates by in vitro kinase assay using recombinant eIF2\u03b1 as a substrate after immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. HRI was not detectable in MA104 cells. INDO did not affect PERK and GCN2 activity, whereas it strongly induced PKR activity (Fig. 7A) . Indomethacin-induced PKR activation was also evidenced in MA104 cells by increased PKR autophosphorylation (Fig. 7B) , starting rapidly after drug administration and attenuating between 4 and 6 h after treatment, concomitantly with attenuation of eIF2\u03b1phosphorylation (Fig. 6B ). As shown in Fig. 7C , treatment with the PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine resulted in preventing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in INDO-treated cells, confirming that PKR is responsible for INDO-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in MA104 cells. Interestingly, treatment with 2-aminopurine also caused the attenuation of INDO antiviral activity in VSV-infected cells (Fig. 7D) .",

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with PKR siRNA or non-specific siRNA and, after 48 h, were mock infected or infected with VSV, and treated with 25 \u03bcM INDO after the 1 h adsorption period. At 8 h p.i. whole-cell extracts were analysed for endogenous PKR levels and VSV-G protein levels by immunoblot analysis. p38 MAPK and tubulin levels were determined as control.

As expected, treatment with INDO resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of VSV-G protein synthesis; however, in PKRsilenced cells, the ability of the drug to inhibit VSV protein synthesis was greatly impaired, and G protein levels were approximately four times higher than in mock-silenced cells.",

As previously reported in cancer cells (Brunelli et al., 2012) , indomethacin-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is mediated by PKR as it is prevented by the PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine; in addition, INDO selectively activates PKR, whereas it does not affect the activity of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases PERK and GCN2 in these cells. In uninfected MA104 cells, PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1-phosphorylation resulted in a transient inhibition of protein synthesis; on the other hand, in VSV-infected cells, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at early times during infection resulted in shutting off viral protein translation, causing a dramatic inhibition of viral replication and infectious viral particle production. Treatment with 2-aminopurine and PKR silencing both resulted in the attenuation of INDO antiviral activity in VSV-infected cells. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that PKR plays an essential role against VSV infection in vitro and in vivo (Stojdl et al., 2000; Durbin et al., 2002) , and that inactivation of the eIF2 complex early after infection blocks VSV protein synthesis (Connor and Lyles, 2005) . On the other hand, Krishnamoorthy et al. (2008) reported that no significant difference in VSV replication was detected in MEFs containing the serine 51 to alanine mutation of eIF2\u03b1 as compared with wild-type cells, indicating that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation does not affect VSV replication under normal, non-stimulated conditions. Nevertheless, the KD of eIF2\u03b1 kinases was shown to be both necessary and sufficient to inhibit VSV protein expression and virus replication in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2008) . It should be pointed out that, as previously reported (Connor and Lyles, 2005) , the kinetics of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may be important for the control of VSV replication, suggesting that inhibition of VSV protein synthesis is achieved if the eIF2 complex is inactivated early after infection. In fact, in our model, pretreatment of host cells with 400 \u03bcM INDO for a 6 h period before viral infection, a time at which eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is restored to the basal level, only modestly affected VSV replication as compared to treatment with the drug started after the 1 h adsorption period.",

            "text": "As anticipated in the Introduction section, a large amount of literature has described in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of indomethacin against several highly pathogenic human viruses, including herpes virus, rotavirus, hepatitis B, HIV and the SARS-CoV coronavirus (Ramirez et al., 1986; Bourinbaiar and Lee-Huang, 1995; Zhu et al., 2002; Rossen et al., 2004; Bahrami et al., 2005; Amici et al., 2006) . Despite an extensive amount of studies, the mechanism for this wide spectrum activity has remained elusive for several decades. It should be pointed out that indomethacin antiviral activity was previously attributed to cyclooxygenase inhibition and prostaglandin-E production during herpes virus (Zhu et al., 2002; Schr\u00f6er and Shenk, 2008) and rotavirus (Rossen et al., 2004) infection. In addition, the antiviral activity of non-selective as well as selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors has been reported also in vivo against several viruses, including VSV Symensma et al., 2003) . In our experimental model, however, INDO activity was not mimicked by the NSAID aspirin and sodium salicylate, nor by the selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 and COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 up to concentrations near the cytotoxic range, suggesting a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism. The results described herein demonstrate that indomethacin, instead, triggers a cellular antiviral defence mechanism by rapidly and effectively activating PKR in an interferon-and dsRNA-independent manner. INDO-triggered PKR signalling effectively blocks viral replication by preventing viral protein translation. The fact that high levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 were associated with INDO antiviral activity also during infection with the parainfluenza Sendai virus and the SA-11 rotavirus (Santoro et al., unpublished results) suggests that activation of the PKR/ eIF2\u03b1 signalling cascade may be implicated in the antiviral effect of INDO against other types of RNA viruses.",

However, the fact that PKR silencing only partially restored virus replication in INDO-treated cells indicates that other mechanisms may contribute to the antiviral activity of the drug. Moreover, because in addition to its role in translation, PKR participates in several signalling pathways controlling transcription (Santoro et al., 2003; Donz\u00e9 et al., 2004; Garc\u00eda et al., 2006; Dabo and Meurs, 2012) , it cannot be excluded that other PKR-mediated mechanisms may be involved in the control of VSV replication after INDO treatment.",

This has now been confirmed in a different model. In addition, it was previously shown that indomethacin was able to induce PKR activity in vitro at levels comparable with the PKR inducer poly(I):poly(C), suggesting a direct effect of the drug in the kinase activation (Brunelli et al., 2012) .",
