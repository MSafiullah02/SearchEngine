            "text": "Rotavirus is a major causative agent of gastroenteritis in children under five, with >120,000 cases of diarrheal death annually, worldwide (Clark et al., 2017). Among nine species of rotavirus (groups A to I), group A rotavirus (RVA) is the major species and the most well studied to date. RVA has a genome of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, which encode the viral structural proteins (VP1-4, VP6 and VP7) and the non-structural proteins (NSP1-6). The current nomenclature system of RVA defines the genotype as: Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx for the VP7-, VP4-, VP6-, VP1-, VP2-, VP3-, NSP1-, NSP2-, NSP3-, NSP4- and NSP5/6-encoding genes, respectively (Matthijnssens et al., 2008, 2011a). Based on the genome sequence, all RVA isolates are classified into genotypes in accordance with the recommendations of the Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG) to ensure uniformity (Matthijnssens et al., 2008). This classification system has been widely adopted and has greatly facilitated the analysis of RVA sequence data, which has uncovered high genetic diversity and proposed new genotypes (Esona et al., 2018; He et al., 2017; Ianiro et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Rojas et al., 2016, 2017; Yinda et al., 2016).",

A limited number of studies have reported on RVA from frugivorous bats: Eidolon helvum in Kenya and Cameroon (Esona et al., 2010; Yinda et al., 2016), Rousettus aegyptiacus in Kenya (Waruhiu et al., 2017) and Rousettus leschenaultii in China (He et al., 2017), and insectivorous bats: Molossus molossus in Brazil (Asano et al., 2016), Rhinolophus simulator in Zambia (Sasaki et al., 2016), Taphozous mauritianus in Kenya (Waruhiu et al., 2017), and Rhinolophus hipposideros, Aselliscus stoliczkanus, Scotophilus kuhlii, Hipposideros pomona and Taphozous melanopogon in China (He et al., 2013, 2017; Xia et al., 2014). Genetic characterization of bat RVAs has led to discoveries of new RVA genotypes. In addition, these studies revealed that bat RVAs not only carry unique genotypes exclusively observed in bats, but also share some genome segments with RVAs derived from humans and other mammals, indicative of interspecies transmission and the zoonotic potential of bat-borne RVA (Esona et al., 2010; He et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2016). Although the sporadic detection of RVA from bats worldwide has demonstrated that RVA infection can occur in some bat species, thus far, the genotypic tropism(s) and transmission cycle of RVA in bat populations are poorly understood.",

These genotypes were initially identified from Cameroonian E. helvum by another research group who proposed that novel RVA genotype constellations exist in E. helvum, such as has been determined in humans and domesticated animals (Matthijnssens et al., 2011b; Matthijnssens and Van Ranst, 2012; Yinda et al., 2016). Our results support this view that certain RVA genotype constellations exist in this bat species. Interestingly, these Zambian bat RVA strains (ZFB14\u201352 and ZFB14\u2013135) carried VP7, VP6 and NSP3 genome segments that shared 97%\u201399% nucleotide sequence identity with those of BatLi08 from E. helvum in Limbe, Cameroon, at least 2800 km apart from our sampling locations. Notably, it has been reported that RVA strain BatLy03 from Cameroonian E. helvum shared the same genotypes for VP2, VP6, VP7, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 as strain KE4852 from Kenyan E. helvum (Yinda et al., 2016).

In this study, we identified the previously unrecognized genotypes N21 for NSP2 and E27 for NSP4 in RVA strain ZFB14\u2013126 from R. aegyptiacus in Zambia. Both N21 and E27 were distinguished from other mammalian RVAs by long branch lengths in their phylogenies (Fig. 2). These results indicate that previously unrecognized genotypes are harbored by bats with unique evolutionary histories. In addition, ZFB14\u2013126 shared the same I22 and T17 genotypes with ZFB14\u201352 and ZFB14\u2013135 from E. helvum (Table 2), suggesting interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment may have occurred between these two bat species in the past. However, we could not formally exclude the possibility of mixed infection with different RVA strains in this individual bat.",

In this study, all detected genome segments were divergent to those of other mammalian RVAs and are tentatively considered to be bat-specific. However, Esona et al. recently identified RVA strain KE4852 from E. helvum, which carried VP4 and NSP4 genes with shorter genetic distances to other mammalian RVAs providing evidence of interspecies transmission between E. helvum and other mammal host species (Esona et al., 2010). Therefore, further studies with increasing numbers of specimens are required to evaluate the public health risk of RVA harbored by Zambian bats and to delineate further the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of these viruses.",
