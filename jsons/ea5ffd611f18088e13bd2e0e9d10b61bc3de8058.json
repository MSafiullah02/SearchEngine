Effective treatment of severe and critically ill patients is the key to reducing the fatality of the disease. The artificial liver blood purification system can remove inflammatory factors, alleviate the damage of the inflammatory response to the body, and has important value for the treatment of severe COVID-19. Led by Academician Lanjuan Li, based on the experience of treating patients across the country, integrating the opinions of experts from all over the country, the center summarized and formulated the consensus including the basic principles, treatment indications, relative contraindications, mode selection, monitoring indicators, and efficacy evaluation of artificial liver, which provides reference for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "At present, the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has entered a critical stage. Effective treatment of severe and critical patients is the key to reduce the fatality of this disease. 1 The acute severe respiratory infectious diseases have common clinical characteristics: rapidly progressing inflammation of the lungs, severe hypoxemia and multiple organ failure. The respiratory failure, shock, multiple organ failure and uncontrollable secondary infection are the main causes of death finally. [2] [3] Studies have revealed that severe cases of SARS, avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections all present a \"cytokine storm\", which is the main factor of disease progression. 4-6 Therefore, blocking the \"cytokine storm\" is a key intervention for the treatment of shock, hypoxemia and multiple organ failure. Studies have shown that the artificial liver support system (ALSS) can remove inflammatory factors and block the \"cytokine storm\", thus reducing damage to the body caused by the inflammatory response, which is of great value for the treatment of severe and critical patients. [7] [8] [9] Clinical practices have shown that Li's ALSS has played an important role in the treatment of patients with severe H7N9 viral infection. [8] [9] After discussions by the expert panel, the consensus has been reached on the principles, indications, contraindications, monitoring indicators and efficacy evaluation of ALSS for the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. 10 ",
