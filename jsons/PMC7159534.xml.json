A preliminary polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test failed to amplify mRNA coding for AGP in leucocytes (data not shown).

In this study, FCoV status was estimated by serology, which correlates with the viral burden determined by PCR testing of faeces\n29\n and suggests the presence of active FCoV\u2013host interactions potentially able to activate an acute\u2010phase reaction. FCoV\u2010seropositive cats were found among both clinically healthy and sick cats, as previously reported,\n30\n but the proportion of cats with AGP\u2010positive leucocytes did not significantly differ according to FCoV status. Serum AGP concentration, AGP sialylation and the leucocyte responses of clinically healthy, FCoV\u2010positive cats differ from those of cats with FIP\n7\n, \n8\n, \n31\n and the finding of a different number of cats with AGP\u2010positive leucocytes would have supported the hypothesis that AGP\u2010bearing leucocytes might influence the FCoV\u2013host interaction, potentially because of the immunomodulatory properties of AGP.\n20\n However, this hypothesis is not supported by the results of this study, because the proportion of cats with AGP on leucocytes increased in cats with FIP or diseases other than FIP. The possible role of AGP in the resistance or susceptibility to FIP hypothesised in previous studies,\n32\n if any, does not involve AGP\u2010bearing leucocytes.",

Specifically, this study demonstrated that AGP can be occasionally found on the leucocytes of clinically healthy cats. The proportion of cats with AGP\u2010positive neutrophils and monocytes increased among the sick animals, most likely associated with the presence of inflammation rather than with the presence of FCoV or leucocytosis. From a clinical perspective, this result suggests that the presence of AGP\u2010positive leucocytes could be considered a marker of inflammation. Other markers of inflammation, including the APP concentration in serum,\n32\n are currently available in routine practice and most of these tests are more accessible and less expensive that flow cytometry. Nevertheless, when the measurement of other serum markers of inflammation provides equivocal results, the detection of AGP\u2010expressing leucocytes by flow cytometry could be an ancillary test to support a clinical suspicion of inflammation. This study did not focus on the mechanism responsible for the presence of AGP on leucocytes membranes, but these results are encouraging of future studies of these mechanisms and the events that induce an increased presence of AGP\u2010positive leucocytes in cats with inflammation. Additionally, further studies should evaluate the diagnostic and/or prognostic role of the presence of AGP\u2010positive leucocytes.",
