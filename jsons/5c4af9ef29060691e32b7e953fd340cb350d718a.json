Estudos anteriores relacionados com a pandemia SARS mostraram uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 80% nos epis\u00f3dios de urg\u00eancia. Assim, o objetivo deste estudo \u00e9 analisar a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos servi\u00e7os de urg\u00eancia durante o primeiro m\u00eas de pandemia, comparando com registos hist\u00f3ricos. M\u00e9todos: Dados de epis\u00f3dios de urg\u00eancia de Portugal continental, de janeiro 2014 a mar\u00e7o 2020, foram extra\u00eddos do Portal da Transpar\u00eancia do SNS e do website de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do SNS. A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00famero de urg\u00eancias de mar\u00e7o a setembro 2020 foi estimada considerando os dados hist\u00f3ricos de janeiro 2014 a fevereiro 2020. A informa\u00e7\u00e3o de mar\u00e7o 2020 foi estimada globalmente, por Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Regional de Sa\u00fade (ARS) e pelo Sistema de Triagem de Manchester (STM). Resultados: Comparando com valores previstos, verificou-se uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 48% no n\u00famero de epis\u00f3dios de urg\u00eancia em mar\u00e7o 2020. Analisando por ARS, Alentejo registou a menor redu\u00e7\u00e3o neste n\u00famero, e curiosamente o Alentejo \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m a \u00e1rea com menos casos de COVID-19 em Portugal continental. Na an\u00e1lise por STM, os epis\u00f3dios amarelos registaram a maior redu\u00e7\u00e3o (50%). Nos epis\u00f3dios urgentes registou-se uma diferen\u00e7a de cerca de 144,000 epis\u00f3dios em mar\u00e7o 2020. Discuss\u00e3o: Os resultados deste estudo preliminar est\u00e3o alinhados \u00e0 evidencia produzida em estudos de pandemias anteriores. Informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da urg\u00eancia e sobre caracter\u00edsticas demogr\u00e1ficas e cl\u00ednicas dos epis\u00f3dios seriam relevantes para analisar esta redu\u00e7\u00e3o. Conclus\u00e3o: Verificouse um decr\u00e9scimo significativo no n\u00famero de urg\u00eancias em mar\u00e7o 2020, e apesar das causas desta redu\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o estarem ainda identificadas, \u00e9 evidente a liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre o in\u00edcio da pandemia e a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da procura. Entender este fen\u00f3meno \u00e9 cr\u00edtico para planear interven\u00e7\u00f5es que evitem morbilidade ou mortes desnecess\u00e1rias, causadas pelo atraso na ida \u00e0 urg\u00eancia.",

In March 2020, 295,451 emergency episodes were registered, representing a 45% reduction concerning the previous 12 months. The number of emergency service use in March 2020 is outside the confidence interval for the forecasted values for March onwards, calculated with the time series (Fig. 1) . This value is statistically different from the monthly average value for the 3 previous years, according to the MTS and RHA (p value < 0.001). In the analysis of the time series by geographic distribution, there is a reduction in the number of emergency service use observed in March 2020 for all RHA (Fig. 2) . Table 1 contains the characterization of the emergency service use in March 2020 in two categories: the real values observed (obtained from NHS data), and the forecasted values (obtained through the forecasting process). In total, there were 295,451 emergency episodes in mainland Portugal in the analyzed month; compared with the forecasted value, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency services used. In the analysis by RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes, with around 12,000 fewer episodes than it was forecasted (41% reduction). Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (LVT) presented the highest reduction both in absolute and percentual values, with 111,000 episodes less than it was forecasted (53%). In the analysis by MTS, the elective episodes (white) had the smallest reductions in percentage; all other categories had reductions superior to 30%. The episodes classified as yellow showed the high- est decrease (50%), which represents a difference of 121,069 episodes in relation to the expected value for this month.",
