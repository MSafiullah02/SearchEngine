Sixteen percent of Singapore's population are Muslims with the majority being of Malay ethnicity. Annually, over 15 000 local pilgrims perform the Hajj and Umrah (an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in KSA) [3]. Travellers returning from their pilgrimage increase the risk of introducing the virus into Singapore. Moreover, Singapore is a major travel hub with 15 231 469 tourists visiting all year round [4]. Additionally, just across the straits north of Singapore, the first laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection was reported on 17 April 2014 in Peninsular Malaysia. The patient was a man who had developed pneumonia with respiratory distress after returning from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia [5]. From January to December 2015 Singapore received a total of 1 171 077 visitors from Malaysia (an average of about 3200/day).

Surveillance data reviewed included the demographic and clinical information pertaining to each suspect case. Using the guidelines from the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH), a suspect case was defined as a person with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness, and with an epidemiological link to countries where MERS-CoV cases had been reported within the preceding 14 days. Suspect cases were admitted to isolation wards for laboratory test confirmation and clinical management.

Second, our infectious disease clinicians ensured that suspect cases were assessed thoroughly before ruling out MERS-CoV infection, with many being tested for influenza and other possible aetiological agents (e.g. S. pneumoniae).

Moreover, while Hajj pilgrims are advised to be vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal disease, the administration of these vaccines is highly variable, and only the mandatory meningococcal vaccine is routinely administered to pilgrims. There is no structured programme to vaccinate this population although the vaccines are widely available at polyclinics, private general practitioner clinics, and travel clinics at private and restructured hospitals. Healthcare providers should be educated on the importance of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims in order to advocate them when providing meningococcal vaccination to pilgrims.",
