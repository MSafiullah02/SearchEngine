However, this method requires improvement as a molecular diagnostic test used by clinical laboratories. The WHO recommended the detection of at least two different targets on the COVID-19 virus genome. For example, Corman et al. recommended the E gene assay as the first-line screening tool, followed by confirmatory testing with the RdRp gene assay [2], [6]. However, our experiments and previous reports show that the N_Sarbeco set is less sensitive than the NIID-N set [2], [3]. In cases where NIID-N is weakly positive and N_Sarbeco is negative, we have found it difficult to judge whether results are true positives or false positives, indicating the need for another assay with sensitivity equal to the NIID-N set to detect two regions of the COVID-19 genome with high sensitivity. In addition, an internal control assay is required for evaluating the qualities of the specimen, nucleic acid extraction step, and RT-PCR amplification [6].",

            "text": "We compared the Cq values of simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR using six SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive samples (Figure 1\n) and observed good correlation between the targets. However, the Cq values of N_Sarbeco showed an average delay of 6.4 cycles (a minimum of 5.5 to a maximum of 7.5). Similar results for Cq values were obtained using simplex NIID-N, multiplex NIID-N and multiplex E_Sarbeco. These results indicate that the sensitivity of NIID-N was not decreased by multiplexing, and E_Sarbeco and NIID-N had equal sensitivity. We also tested another nucleic acid extraction kit (High Pure Viral RNA Kit, Roche). Although the Cq values were slightly higher than those obtained using a Maxwell RSC Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (minimum \u22120.8, average 2.0, maximum 3.2), both NIID_N and E_Sarbeco were detected from all six samples.",

Four positive and twenty negative results were confirmed by simplex rRT-PCR. The four positive samples were NIID-N-positive and the N_Sarbeco-negative results were confirmed by simplex rRT-PCR. Although these samples had low copies (<25 copies/reaction as determined by NIID-N), a concordant result was obtained using the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method. In addition, in one of the four samples, the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method could simultaneously detect two regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N and E genes) and the human ABL1 gene. Four target positive samples (NIID-N/E_Sarbeco: positive/positive, N=1; positive/negative, N=3) were obtained from the same patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA of these samples calculated by NIID-N were 15, 16 (also determined by E_Sarbeco, 19 copies/reaction), 5, and 2 copies/reaction. Twenty samples provided negative results for SARS-CoV-2. The Cq values for the ABL1 gene in these samples were less than 35 cycles (minimum 24.6, average 28.6, maximum 32.3), and the assay quality was validated.",
