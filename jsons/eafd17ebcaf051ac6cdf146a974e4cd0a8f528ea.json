            "text": "Although the association between ribavirin and hypocalcemia has not been well established, it was noted in 9 of 20 patients receiving ribavirin plus consensus IFN and in only 2 of 20 patients receiving consensus IFN alone for chronic hepatitis C, suggesting that the decrease in the calcium level may be, at least in part, related to ribavirin therapy [14] . Hypocalcemia has also been reported in 6 adult patients with severe measles pneumonitis who were treated with ribavirin [15] ; although the hypocalcemia was attributed to disease, ribavirin may have contributed to the development of this AE. Hypomagnesemia secondary to ribavirin use has not been previously Length of hospital stay, mean days \u202b\u05e2\u202c SD 9.6 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 6.2 9.4 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 6.2 .89 a Corrected for albumin. b Calcium carbonate (1250 mg t.i.d.) initiated at start of ribavirin therapy. c High-dose ribavirin therapy consisted of a cumulative dose of \u044320 g (e.g., 2 g iv as a loading dose, followed by 1 g q6h for 4 days, then 500 mg q8h for 3 days); low-dose therapy consisted of a cumulative dose of !20 g (e.g., 400 mg iv q8h for 4 days, followed by 1. Ribavirin has a significant teratogenic and mutagenic effect. Animal studies have demonstrated various congenital malformations, as well as growth retardation and fetal deaths. In addition, because of possible accumulation of ribavirin in spermatozoa, the concerns of mutagenic effects in the offspring of men treated with ribavirin, and the unknown risk for teratogenic effects of ribavirin in humans, strict contraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women treated with ribavirin, both during treatment and for several months after cessation [16] . The extensive accumulation of ribavirin nucleo-tides and their slow dephosphorylation contribute to the long half-life (\u223c300 h) after receipt of multiple doses. To prevent potential teratogenic effects, it is recommended that 15 halflives (or 6 months) is required to ensure complete washout after discontinuation of ribavirin [17] .",

            "text": "Serious AEs, including HA and electrolyte disturbances, occurred early and frequently in Canadian patients with SARS who were treated with ribavirin. Ascribing causality in this situation is difficult in view of the lack of a comparably ill control group not treated with ribavirin, the likely contribution of the underlying disease, the long intracellular half-life of ribavirin, and the lack of rechallenge information. Health authorities in Canada have restricted the use of ribavirin on the basis of a lack of in vitro antiviral effect against SARS coronavirus at therapeutic concentrations [18] and the high incidence of ribavirin-associated AEs in treated patients [19] . A recent retrospective Canadian study highlights that ribavirin may not have clinical efficacy, may actually adversely affect outcome, and may need to be prematurely discontinued because of AEs in almost 20% of patients [20] . However, widespread use of ribavirin continues in Hong Kong, where AEs comparable to the Canadian experience have not been reported and where continued use has been justified by the potential nonspecific immunomodulatory activity of the drug and in vivo activity in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus model [10] . In view of the long half-life of ribavirin, the potential for teratogenicity, and the potential for significant drug-associated morbidity and mortality, vigilant monitoring for both short-term and longterm AEs is needed for patients exposed to this drug. The Canadian experience with ribavirin in the treatment of SARS suggests that the benefits of use may not outweigh the risk of AEs and the potential for ribavirin to have negative economic consequences on hospitals endorsing its use.",
