            "text": "Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has rapidly spread across the world and has now infected a total of 348678 people in 187 countries (March 21, 2020) [1]. China has listed COVID-19 as a class B infectious disease and has undertaken preventive and control measures according to class A infectious diseases [2]. With the spread of the epidemic, presently, patients infected with the novel coronavirus, as well as those with asymptomatic infection, are the main sources of infection; thus, COVID-19 is an infectious disease with a medium to slightly high contagious capacity [3]. The incubation period of the disease is generally 7 days, and the longest is 14 days; however, some cases have reported an incubation period of 24 days as well [4]. Common clinical manifestations include fever, dry cough and fatigue. Computerized tomography of the chest can show multiple ground glass shadows of the pulmonary lobes, indicative of conditions such as respiratory distress syndrome, shock and sepsis, which can even lead to death [5]. Thus far, although China has announced six trials and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, the focus remains mainly on symptomatic treatment, new drugs specifically approved for the infection are not available. Clinical trials for new drugs such as remdesivir and coolidge are underway; however, the clinical promotion and short-term use of these drugs is unlikely. Therefore, given the particularities of this disease, it is of critical clinical value to formulate a set of treatment plans using integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine, based on the concept of prevention and treatment. To utilize the advantages of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, this paper discussed the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 from the viewpoint of integrated TCM and Western medicine, the treatment measures for different susceptible groups, and the effect along with matters needing attention, so as to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Wuhan, the center of the outbreak pathogen, is located in the east of Jianghan Plain of China. The vertical and horizontal water areas of the city\u2019s rivers account for one-fourth of the total city area, demonstrating the natural environmental basis of \u201cdamp evil\u201d [12]. At the initial stage of this epidemic, most patients presented symptoms of fever; however, there were also patients with no fever or low fever, and some patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms, such as indigestion and loose stool, as well as chest tightness and fatigue, coinciding with the characteristics of \u201cdamp evil\u201d in TCM. Hence, this disease is an epidemic, with the primary nature of \u201cdamp\u201d and \u201ctoxic,\u201d and thus can be termed \u201cdamp toxin disease.\u201d Furthermore, in 2019, Wuhan experienced a warm winter climate, with incoming heat instead of cold. From the perspective of TCM, this kind of climate change is prone to generate damp-heat in the human body, which persists and is difficult to eliminate from Sanjiao (one of the six fu-organs in TCM theory). Some patients have a recurrent fever, bitter mouth, insomnia, upset, chest tightness and shortness of breath, fatigue, yellow or greasy tongue coating, and slippery pulse, which are manifestations of the evil underlying Shaoyang meridian according to the six-meridian syndrome differentiation theory [13]. Notably, the most severe cases developed dyspnea one week later, which even progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, intractable metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, leading to death [14]. According to TCM, the toxins from these patients not only hurt the Qi but also injure the nutrient blood and result in blood stasis; the pericardium transmission channel is also reversed, resulting in mental changes. Dampness stagnates for a prolonged period and turns into heat; heat toxin accumulates for a long time, resulting in stasis; stasis and heat combine mutually and then generate syncope, which consumes Qi and Yin and leads to a deficiency. According to the principle of \u201cthree factors and measures,\u201d there exist various etiological characteristics in different regions, as well as climatic factors. Fan et al. [15] observed and analyzed the TCM pathological characteristics of \u201cdryness\u201d in Hunan cases, and concluded that dryness and dampness are mainly due to \u201cchild disease to mother\u201d in the course of the disease. In the theory of TCM, dryness evil can easily injure the lung. Lung and spleen belong to \u201cgold\u201d and \u201csoil\u201d in the five-element theory of TCM. Dryness turns into dampness. Dampness easily traps spleen. Wet soil is the mother of dryness \u201cgold.\u201d Furthermore, excessive lung dryness injures the spleen \u201csoil\u201d; hence, both lung dryness and spleen dampness are significant. In contrast, Yu et al. [16] summed up the data and concluded that the diseases in Guangdong Province and Gansu Province were caused by warm-heat toxin or epidemic toxin, which was closely related to their regional environment. Guangdong Province is hot and humid all year round, and the epidemic Qi can easily mix with evils of damp and heat to attack the lung; however, the overall 2019 winter temperature in Gansu Province was higher than that experienced in previous years. Additionally, Gansu is located in the northwest region of China, which is mostly dry and warm, and susceptible to the evil of dryness that can cause lung disease. TCM runs through the whole idea of disease differentiation all the time, and the unified relationship between man and nature has been called \u201ccorrespondence between man and nature\u201d in ancient books, which presents considerable advantage in the treatment of COVID-19 in different populations and regions.",

            "text": "Compared with other diseases, the evil Qi of the \u201cdamp toxin epidemic\u201d is relatively fixed, and hence, the etiology and pathogenesis are relatively fixed, with obvious stages of disease progression in clinical settings. Understanding the consistency of the stages also allows for clinical diagnosis and evidence-based treatment. After careful assessment of the four pieces of diagnostic evidence available regarding the confirmed cases, it was observed that this epidemic is mainly caused by a dampness pathogen, with the disease location of mainly Sangjiao, and the core pathogenesis is \u201cdampness, heat, poison, blood stasis and deficiency,\u201d which runs through the whole process of dampness and intoxication and closure of the lung. The Treatise on Epidemic Febrile Diseases\n[11] ascertains that typhoid fever does not infect people, but epidemic diseases can infect people. The evil of typhoid fever enters from the orifices, while the evil of epidemic disease enters only from the mouth and nose; it has been observed that during an epidemic, the evil comes from the mouth and nose, remains in the membrane, and unconsciously lurks in the human body [17]. COVID-19 is located in the lung, where evil Qi first invades the body from the mouth and nose, repressing the lung Qi. In turn, the lung fails to disperse and descend, with symptoms of dry cough. The \u201cdamp evil\u201d is heavy and viscous, blocking the Qi mechanism and causing chest tightness, body heat, and muscle soreness. \u201cDamp evil\u201d traps the spleen, easily injuring Yang Qi. The spleen dominates and transports water and food through the body. When the Qi fails to rise, the spleen cannot be nourished, and symptoms begin to appear, including fatigue, gastric congestion and loose stool. The spleen and stomach act as the exterior and interior of each other; hence, the spleen\u2019s dysfunction affects the stomach\u2019s absorption. The dampness accompanying the epidemic toxin into heat is manifested as high fever, occasional yellow phlegm, obvious asthma due to the dampness toxin, and sticky stool due to the stagnation of dampness. Wang Qingren stated in Correcting Mistakes in Medicine that \u201cthe plague toxin burns its blood inside, and if the blood is burned and refined, the blood will coagulate [18].\u201d During this period, the heat toxin burns the body fluid, and dampness suppresses the Qi mechanism, resulting in the stasis of blood, manifested in the form of increased dyspnea and additional mental problems occurring during the reverse transmission of the pericardium. In the later stage, the body is damaged by fluid consumption, and is deficient in both Qi and Yin. During this period of treatment, attention should be paid to whether there is any residual evil in the body.",

[19] observed and stated that owing to climatic factors, dryness has been present in the lung for a prolonged period. On encountering the epidemic toxin, dampness and cold will collide with each other, and obstruct the lung and chest, injuring vital Qi, leading to the stagnation of the Qi mechanism and abnormal rise and fall of evil Qi, finally leading to a deficiency of vital energy. Although there exist differing opinions, combined with the clinical manifestations of the published and confirmed cases, the main etiology and pathogenesis can be attributed to \u201cdampness, heat, toxin, blood stasis and deficiency.\u201d Furthermore, the pathogenesis may differ among individuals. In the case of adults without underlying diseases, because of being in the prime of life, the presence of vital Qi, as well as the balance and coordination of movement and transformation of Qi, blood, Yin and Yang, is sufficient to resist external evil, demonstrating no susceptibility or mild susceptibility, with a short disease course and a good prognosis. In children, for the viscera are not well developed, presenting delicate viscera, unfilled shape and Qi, and immature Yin and Yang, they fall sick easily and quickly [20]. However, in the overall growing phase, they are made up of \u201cpure Yang\u201d, are robust, and will recover easily. Patients with underlying diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic tracheitis, tumors, or other diseases, usually suffer from a deficiency of vital Qi; if they experience the external evil, the disease is often characterized by severe illness, rapid progression, and rapid transmission, resulting in critical illness and even death. Pregnant women have a special physiological state, with a relative deficiency of Yin-blood and relative hyperactivity of Yang Qi. The growth of the fetus blocks the rise and fall mechanism of the Qi in pregnant women, which may lead to poor operation of Qi and blood. Therefore, the elderly, the infirm, children and pregnant women require close monitoring.",

The process of dampness removal is considered during diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Although the epidemic toxin is mainly characterized by toxic heat, dampness and turbidity, it is difficult to separate the heat and dampness characteristics from the initial stages of the infection to the end. It is also difficult to only get rid of heat without removal of dampness as well. Dampness is Yin evil, and it is unsuitable to use cold and cool drugs during the early stage; warm and tonic herbs in the later stage should also be used cautiously. Furthermore, it is permissible to use a combination of drugs to resolve dampness, dry dampness, and drain dampness during different stages. (2) Promoting blood circulation and resolving blood stasis. The patients should be treated with drugs for promoting blood circulation and resolving blood stasis immediately after the appearance of lung shadow. During COVID-19, the patients present high fever, sputum mixed with blood, dark purple-colored tongue, and consolidation or ground glass shadows in early lung images. Pathological reports indicated diffuse alveolar damage, hyperemia, hemorrhage, edema, and pulmonary interstitial inflammation, which are all manifestations of blood stasis. Therefore, during the different stages of treatment, it is necessary to combine products promoting blood circulation and eliminating blood stasis, dredging blood vessels, removing blood stasis, reducing alveolar damage, preventing pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, and reducing sequelae, which is conducive to the comprehensive rehabilitation of patients. Additionally, there are no specific Chinese medicine prescriptions for the elderly, pregnant women, children, and patients with underlying diseases. Hence, it is essential to study the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 cases to provide effective treatment.",

Therefore, those who have a history of exposure or have been in close contact with epidemic areas should be prioritized with the treatment principles, including stabilizing Qi and strengthening the exterior, removing heat, and detoxifying the body according to the composition of the prescription and climatic factors in different regions, to practice prevention before disease occurrence. In the cases of patients with chronic illness or those susceptible to infection, emphasis should be given to strengthening the vital energy, improving immunity, and using Yupingfeng Powder to invigorate Qi and solidify the exterior [26]. Individuals with underlying diseases can be treated regionally according to their diseases. According to TCM, after conception, the whole body\u2019s Yin-blood is gathered in Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian, and the uterus, placing the pregnant women in a special physiological state of a relative deficiency of Yin-blood and relative hyperactivity of Yang Qi. The growing fetus will block the rise and fall of Qi and blood, resulting in poor operation of Qi and blood. \u201cIt should be cool before pregnancy and warm after birth\u201d is the general principle of regulation and stabilization in TCM before and after pregnancy. This can be adjusted and treated in advance to prevent the occurrence of disease, and the method of nourishing Yin and clearing heat, regulating the Qi mechanism, and calming the fetus is adopted. Young children are not full of Qi; their Yin and Yang are immature, and their viscera are delicate, especially, the lung, spleen and kidney [26]. Hence, it is recommended to protect the Qi of the spleen and stomach in advance to nourish other organs, strengthen their physique, and resist the evil of epidemic disease, utilizing Sijunzi Decoction or Yupingfeng Powder to invigorate the Qi for consolidating superficies [26]. According to TCM, different people have different physical characteristics, and hence, different treatment principles and medication plans should be generated based on their physical characteristics (Table 3\n). Based on the existing treatment schemes, the prescription composition and dosage recommended for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 during different stages are introduced in Table 4\n.",

            "text": "The use of TCM adopts the holistic concept, combined with symptoms, signs and other corresponding manifestations, to examine the syndromes and seek the causes, to support the selection of drugs based on syndrome differentiation. Syndrome differentiation and treatment, as one of the characteristics and advantages of TCM, is very important in diagnosis and treatment. For example, in the treatment of COVID-19, the syndrome types differ among individuals in different regions, under different climatic conditions, and for relatively different physiques. Syndrome differentiation should be clearly defined in combination with different factors and clinical syndrome characteristics. Prescriptions are mainly used to improve immunity, balance human Qi, blood, Yin and Yang, and recover organ function. According to the study of COVID-19 treatment herbs [41], [42], Chinese herbal medicines with a higher probability to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 have been selected, including Lianqiao, Gancao, Sangbaipi, Jinyinhua, Sangye, Pipaye, and other herbs, commonly used to treat viral pneumonia. Drugs should be selected and utilized according to the corresponding syndrome types. Furthermore, with disease development, the drugs should be given the flexibility to deal with different syndrome types, and the whole process should be adjusted according to the principle of \u201cthree factors and measures,\u201d undertaking multi-target treatment. TCM also plays a leading role during the recovery period and post-discharge convalescence. Currently, although some patients present a negative nucleic acid test accompanied by alleviated pneumonia and recovered body temperature, they may still demonstrate symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and anxiety. Some patients may present pulmonary fibrosis due to poor absorption of pulmonary inflammation, which may affect the quality of life; additionally, some patients may suffer adverse reactions during drug therapy. It is crucial to resolve such related issues when TCM is involved. However, we do not advocate taking medicine without incident, and the preventive prescription is only a corresponding choice for people with an imbalance of Qi, blood, and Yin and Yang. When selecting the prescription, attention should be paid to the syndrome and symptoms, especially in special groups, such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Moreover, any special physique should be closely monitored when using medicines, and the improper use of interventions is not recommended; the overuse of cold or hot drugs should be avoided. Current research on Qingfei Paidu Decoction, a combination of prescriptions from the Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases written by Zhang Zhongjing in the Han Dynasty, has made progress in the special project documented by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China on screening effective prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia [43]. As of February 5, four pilot provinces have used the Qingfei Paidu Decoction to treat 214 confirmed cases, with a treatment course of 3 days, demonstrating a total efficacy rate exceeding 90%, among which over 60% of the patients showed significant improvement in symptoms and imaging manifestations, and 30% patients demonstrated stabilized symptoms without aggravation. Concurrently, Lianhua Qingwen Granule [44] is used in clinical treatment based on the principle of clearing away epidemic toxin, dispersing the lung, and expelling heat. Reportedly, it has been confirmed to significantly improve fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath in confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to the feedback of clinical data, the efficacy of TCM in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 is great, and it still needs to be adjusted and improved with the clinical accumulation. In brief, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine can complement each other\u2019s advantages, which can improve the comprehension of the core of the disease, and cooperate actively and effectively in clinical settings to enhance overall efficacy.",
