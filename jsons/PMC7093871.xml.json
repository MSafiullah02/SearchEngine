Molecular modeling used Accelrys\u2019 Discovery Suite software version 2.5.5 (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). The dsRNA structure of the dimer/biol-dsRNA complex was mutated in situ to the respective poly I (blue) and poly C12U (magenta) chains maintaining the phosphate backbone linear translational coordinates of the X-ray crystallographic structure. The coordinates of the human TLR3 monomer were used to replace each homodimer. Several unacceptable close van der Waals contacts for the human TLR3 crystal coordinates were resolved by an alternate rotamer conformation of the individual amino acid R group. To demonstrate the relative equivalence of these two ligands as TLR3 agonists, we in silico measured the potential energies of the ligands, naked homodimers, and the TLR3-ligand complex. The reduction in potential energy of the complex versus the sum of the potential energy of the components is the energy of binding.",

Animals were dosed similar to the human schedule, with twice-weekly infusions of rintatolimod at 6, 18, or 36 mg/kg per dose, which were expected to be nonlethal on the basis of the acute toxicity studies. Dose levels were determined by the human dose of 400 mg per infusion, which is approximately 6 mg/kg for an average-sized patient. Results of these two chronic toxicological studies were consistent with the findings of the acute toxicological dosing (Table 2\n), although lethality in the rat during the 6-month course of the study was commonly observed. The rat was extremely sensitive in multiple organs to both the 18- and 36-mg dosing regimens, and many animals in these groups did not survive the 6-month dosing period. In the rat, dose-dependent liver and renal toxicities were observed in all three dosage groups. Additional findings in the rat included anemia and polychromasia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and profound elevation of hepatic transaminases. Histopathological features were consistent with clinical analytes. Dose-dependent toxicities were observed in all dose groups, with hepatocellular degeneration, bile duct hyperplasia, and interstitial nephritis with renal tubular dilation. Lymphoid depletion and hyperpigmentation (probably hemosiderin) were noted in the spleen, and extramedullary hematopoiesis and occasional miscellaneous organ inflammation were also noted in all dose groups. In contrast, monkeys tolerated the 6-month course without significant toxicity, except for occasional vomiting associated with infusion in the 36 mg/kg group. There were transient elevations of hepatic transaminases only in the high-dose group, associated with an unexplained decrease in alkaline phosphatase in the monkey. Coagulation parameters were prolonged in the high-dose monkey group. There were no histopathological findings in the monkey, with the exception of increased myelopoiesis in the marrow and follicular thyroid hyperplasia in the 18 and 36 mg/kg dose groups. The thyroid morphological observation in the nonhuman primate was correlated with an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine, suggesting a central effect on the pituitary causing thyroid hyperactivity and the observed hyperplasia.",

Preclinical studies in the rat and cynomolgus monkey assessed the induction of these three inflammatory cytokines, as well as IL-10, measured in the serum in response to three dosage levels (6, 18, and 36 mg/kg) of rintatolimod administered by i.v. infusion. The 4-hour time point in response to initial infusion in rats gave the strongest systemic signals, which are illustrated in Table 4\n, with the expression pattern consistent, although less intense, at later time points. The monkey exhibited minimal evidence of systemic cytokine production. A minimal IFN-\u03b3 response was observed that was significantly different from that in the rat. IL-12p70 at the highest 36 mg/kg dose level generated a small response in one monkey. In contrast, the rat showed a systemic cytokine response, with signals present for all three inflammatory cytokines and IL-10, even at the lowest 6 mg/kg dose. The species difference for systemic inflammatory cytokine expression is statistically significant for each cytokine (P < 0.02). For comparison with humans, serum was obtained from 14 patients participating in a concurrent open-label clinical study of chronic fatigue syndrome (AMP-511), with a similar time course to the animal pharmacological characteristics and quantified for the same panel of cytokines. The human clinical trial patients were dosed with 400 mg of rintatolimod i.v. over 30 to 60 minutes. Similar to the monkey response, serum cytokine increases were minimally expressed with IFN-\u03b3, the highest in the aggregate, with a large SD (Table 5\n). Finally, we assessed for evidence of chronic systemic cytokine changes at the week 32 time point, obtained from 72 patients participating in another rintatolimod chronic fatigue clinical trial (AMP-516). Table 5 illustrates results similar to those of the monkey, with one patient exhibiting a relatively high systemic TNF-\u03b1 level.",

Again, systemic signals of cytokine change in association with 32 weeks of rintatolimod at 400 mg per dose i.v., twice weekly, were not evidenced. Human DCs do show phenotypic changes in association with exposure to rintatolimod, including shift in maturation profile and local release of cytokines (IL-12p70, ILs 4, 6, and 10, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1) and the chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (CCL3) in the microenvironment of culture supernatants.21, 22 As demonstrated in this communication, systemic elevations of inflammatory cytokines are observed in rats. In monkeys and humans, any local elevations (microenvironment) induced by rintatolimod were rarely detected systemically. The difference is in the magnitude of the response. It is this difference in humans that appears to be responsible, at least in part, with the relative lack of toxicity in primates. Toxicities associated with overwhelming infection are associated with systemic cytokine storms23, 24 of elevated measurable circulating cytokines.

We modeled the predicted relative binding constants of poly I:poly C versus their mismatched poly C analogues.

These noncovalent contacts provide the collective energetics of binding to form the active homodimer. poly I:poly C demonstrates equivalent in silico energetics of binding with rintatolimod and several other structures with mismatched bases in the poly C strand (Table 6\n). The insertion of a uridine in the poly C strand of poly I:poly C at various ratios of C/U has no significant effect on the binding affinity with TLR3. Thus, any biological differences observed between rintatolimod and poly I:poly C cannot be attributed to a differential affinity of TLR3 binding.",

The major divergence was as anticipated between old world [M. mulatta, M. fasicularis (cynomolgus), and P. anubis (baboon)] and new world (C. jacchus and S. boliviensis) monkeys. The specific sequence differences between the cynomolgus monkey and rat, relative to humans, are listed in Table 7\n. Expressed TLR3 protein in the monkey and rat is similar in its total amino acid composition (905 and 906 residues, respectively) versus a shorter human TLR3 (889 residues). As expected, the monkey TLR3 has greater homology to human (95%) than mouse/rat sequences (80%; note that the mouse and rat are 100% homologous). Rodents have sequence differences versus humans in all of the 23 leucine rich repeats. Differences between humans and monkeys are present in leucine rich repears 2 to 6 and 8 to 22 (20 of 23). The endodomain is more highly conserved between the three species than the ectodomain, probably because of the critical cell signaling function of the cytoplasmic Toll and IL-1 receptor (TIR), which suggests that the monkey and rodent signaling domains may have greater functional similarities than human, on the basis of the large disparity in residue length of human versus monkey and rodent TIR endodomains.",

            "text": "Rintatolimod provided a unique tool that allowed us to dissect the differential effect of species on the systemic response to TLR3 activation. Although poly I:poly C serves as a ligand for TLR3, and is a prototypic TLR3 agonist for experimental purposes, it also activates the dsRNA-sensing cytosolic helicases. The substitution of a mismatched base (uridine) in the poly C strand of rintatolimod inactivates its ligand activity for the cytosolic helicases (MDA5 and RIG-1) while maintaining its agonist activity for TLR3.19, 20 The helicases act through the inflammatory MyD88 pathway used by all mammalian TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, which uses the TRIF adapter to initiate innate immune responses. Figure 1 illustrates the pattern recognition of the ectodomain of the TLRs and their cytoplasmic adapter pathways responsible for their pleiotrophic effects. Figure 1A depicts the non-MyD88 pathway used by TLR3, and Figure 1B depicts the MyD88-dependent pathways used by all TLRs and the helicases, with the exception of TLR3. Our toxicological analysis demonstrated systemic dose-dependent inflammatory cytokine responses in rats. Although we did not examine inflammatory cytokine responses in rabbit or dog because of a lack of available test kits for the cytokines examined, we believe we would observe a similar quantitative cytokine response in the dog as observed in the rat. The rabbit was so sensitive to rintatolimod that the mechanism may be simply induced by systemic cytokine levels, although other toxicity mechanisms may be involved. There were, however, no significant detectable systemic inflammatory cytokines in either monkeys or humans. The data indicate that the parallel intracellular IFN and NF-\u03baB transcriptional pathways are species dependent in magnitude of response because primate cells in culture respond to rintatolimod, with the biosynthesis of the IFNs and inflammatory cytokines insufficient in vivo to provide a detectable systemic response. The lack of a systemic inflammatory response in primates is consistent with our observation of discordant in vivo toxicities between rats, monkeys, and humans and is consistent with the differences in gross analysis and histopathological characteristics observed between the species. In the case of MyD88-dependent TLR pathways, primates are more sensitive.2 In contrast, primates are much more resilient than rodents to inflammatory cytokine toxicity induced by non\u2013MyD88-dependent, TRIF-mediated activation of TLR3. Redundant helicase pathways may reduce the toxicological distinction between species for agonists that activate these pathways, such as poly I:poly C, in contrast to rintatolimod.",

            "text": "Potential mechanisms that may explain the species-specific differential toxicities observed with TLR3 activation by dsRNA are apparent on analysis of gene structural differences between species. In addition to the primary sequence differences between rodents and primates illustrated in Table 7, rodent and human TLR3 gene structures are remarkably dissimilar in the proximal promoter domains, as well as TLR3 isoforms.26, 27 An example of differential functional activity between mice and humans is the induction of TLR3 expression in murine macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; ie, not seen in humans).7 Expression in human blood cells (including monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells) and tissue macrophages is undetectable at the transcript level after LPS exposure and is only seen in myeloid DCs.12, 28 Additional structural differences exist, resulting in possible differential TLR3 isoforms. TLR3 transcripts are initiated in either exon 1 or exon 2 of the mouse, indicating different promoters not present in humans.27 The cloning of a human TLR3 isoform29 suggests an alternate, but previously unrecognized, splicing pathway. The observed species-specific LPS responsiveness in macrophages could be conferred by consensus motifs for NF-\u03baB binding present in the murine TLR promoter, which are absent in human promoter.28 This has been confirmed by later studies that demonstrate that species-specific differences in tissue expression and responses to LPS coincide with the presence of different evolutionary nonconserved promoter sequences in both species. However, despite the overall nonrelatedness of TLR3 promoter sequences, mRNA expression of both TLR3 orthologs was induced by IFNs, particularly by IFN-\u03b2. The basal and IFN-\u03b2\u2013induced activation of promoters from both species largely depended on similar IFN regulatory factor (IRF) elements, which constitutively bound IRF-2 and recruited IRF-1 after stimulation.27 In murine macrophages, TLR3 up-regulation induced by IFN-\u03b2 required IFNAR1, STAT1, and, in part, IRF-1, but not the Janus kinase family member, Tyk2. Also, LPS specifically up-regulates TLR3 expression through the induction of autocrine/paracrine IFN-\u03b2. In humans, however, IFN-\u03b2\u2013induced up-regulation of TLR3 was blocked by pretreatment with LPS, despite the efficient induction of IRF-1.28\n",

Analysis of the dose-dependent toxicities between rats, monkeys, and humans was remarkably dissimilar. Primates are far more resilient to TLR3 stimulation than rodents. The data are consistent with differential TLR3 nuclear transcriptional activities, with the NF-\u03baB pathway in inflammatory cytokine production in primates playing a relatively minor role compared with the IRF-3/IRF-7 nuclear IFN inducers. Interestingly, rintatolimod has most recently been advanced clinically as a therapeutic modulator of chronic fatigue syndrome, a condition manifested by disordered energy metabolism and symptoms curiously reminiscent of the toxicity associated with inflammatory innate immune responses. It is hypothesized that the therapeutic effect may relate to feedback inhibition in these pathways, with rintatolimod being specific in its activity.",

Alternative methods of in vitro analysis, such as demonstrated by Stebbings et al,36 need to be validated and adapted for regulatory evaluation for human safety. Analogous issues may be encountered in modeling retinal disease across species in the context of RNA-based therapeutics.37 The recognition of differential in vivo toxicities and understanding the mechanisms involved should be beneficial in the rational design and risk-benefit analysis of new pharmacological agents for human use.",

A: The intracellular pathways for MyD88-independent TLR3 nuclear signal transduction initiated by TRIF binding to the TIR of the TLR3 homodimer. TLR3 monomers dimerize with binding of the dsRNA ligand. Activated TRIF initiates two pathways. The first results in the transitory induction of the IFNs. The second is a species-variable pathway (rodents >> primates) that operates through NF-\u03baB (dashed line) that transiently induces the production of inflammatory cytokines. Adapter protein cascade initiated by TRIF, TBK1, TRAF1/3, NAP1, IKK, IKK\u03b5, P13K, IRF-3/7, TAK1, TAB1, and RIP1. The ectodomain of TLR3 consists of a horseshoe-shaped structure populated by 23 leucine-rich \u03b2-sheets (orange disks) connected by nonordered chains containing RNA-binding residues. The transmembrane \u03b1-helices (solid orange) connect the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic TIR domain (dark green). The phosphorylated TIR binds TRIF to initiate the adapter protein cascade.
