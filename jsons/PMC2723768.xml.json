Vectored vaccines are one of the most feasible approaches for achieving protection against infection with such pathogens [reviewed in [1]]. While the use of human viruses as vaccine vectors may be seriously hampered by pre-existing immunity to these viruses, development of vaccines based on antigenically distinct non-human viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), may represent a viable alternative.",

NDV isolates can be divided into three groups based on their degree of virulence in birds: (i) lentogenic strains, which cause mild or non-apparent infections that are largely limited to the respiratory or alimentary tract and which include strains presently in use as live vaccines for chickens; (ii) mesogenic stains, which can cause systemic infections of intermediate severity, but are also sometimes used for vaccination of poultry; and (iii) velogenic strains, which cause systemic infections with high mortality rates. A major determinant of NDV virulence in birds is the cleavage site of the F protein. In velogenic and mesogenic strains, the F cleavage site is polybasic, and cleavage is mediated by ubiquitous intracellular proteases such as furin. In lentogenic strains, the cleavage site contains fewer basic amino acids, and cleavage is dependent on secretory trypsin-like proteases present only in luminal fluids of the respiratory and alimentary tracts. Replacement of the F cleavage site of lentogenic strains with a polybasic site from a mesogenic strain results in a virus whose virulence is intermediate between that of the parental lentogenic strain and the mesogenic strain from which the cleavage site is derived [2], [3].",

            "text": "In recent years, we and others have developed vaccine constructs for potential human use based on lentogenic and mesogenic NDV strains as well as lentogenic strains that were modified to contain a polybasic cleavage site [4]. In mice, intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP) or intranasal (IN) immunization with these constructs resulted in a protective immune response [5], [6], [7]. However, because mice are phylogenetically and anatomically distinct from humans, it is unknown whether results obtained with in mice can be extrapolated to potential human use. In particular, the safety and efficacy of live NDV-vectored vaccines will depend on how well this avian virus replicates in the heterologous host, and it is unclear how the level of permissiveness in rodents would compare to that in primates. Additional studies in non-human primates, a model that is more relevant to potential human use, showed that, when administered by the combined IN and intratracheal (IT) routes, NDV is highly attenuated, well-tolerated, immunogenic, and protective [8], [9], [10], as reviewed in [4]. In the present study, we used a non-human primate model to compare various routes of immunization with NDV-vectored vaccines. In addition, we compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an NDV-vectored vaccine based on a mesogenic strain of the virus with that based on a modified lentogenic strain carrying a polybasic F cleavage site in order to choose the vector representing the best balance of immunogenicity versus veterinary safety.",

We previously modified NDV-BC to express the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), creating NDV-BC/HN, and previously modified NDV-BC and NDV-VF to express the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV, creating NDV-VF/S and NDV-BC/S, respectively [8], [10]. Briefly, the open reading frame encoding the HPIV3 HN protein (accession number Z11575.1) or the SARS-CoV S protein (accession number AAP13441.1) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the P/M junction of the NDV-BC or NDV-VF genome to be expressed as a separate mRNA. NDV recombinants were recovered and amplified in embryonated chicken eggs. Titers of the constructs were determined by plaque titration on monolayers of DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells in 24-well plates.",

Neither one nor two doses of NDV-BC/HN administered by the SC route resulted in a detectable NDV HAI response. A similar result was obtained for the HPIV3-specific response, as either one or two doses of NDV-BC/HN administered by the combined IN/IT routes induced HPIV3-specific HAI titers (Fig. 1B).

We have previously shown that NDV-BC expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV (NDV-BC/S) induced a protective immune response in AGM when delivered by the combined IN/IT routes [8]. In the present study, we immunized AGM with the NDV-BC empty vector by the IN/IT routes (2 animals) or with NDV-BC/S by the IN/IT routes (4 animals) or by the IN route only (4 animals). Four additional animals were immunized by the IN/IT routes with NDV-VF/S, which is a version of the lentogenic La Sota strain that contains the polybasic F cleavage site of NDV-BC and was engineered to express the SARS-CoV S protein [8]. On day 28 after the first immunization, all animals received a second dose of the same construct by the same route. TL samples were obtained after the initial vaccine dose to assess vector shedding (Fig. 2). The shedding of NDV-BC/S was reduced compared to the NDV-BC empty vector, suggesting that insertion of the SARS-CoV S ORF attenuated in vivo replication (Fig. 2). We also detected a lower level of shedding in animals immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN route, suggesting that this route resulted in a reduced level of replication. Shedding was not detected in animals immunized with NDV-VF/S, suggesting a greater level of attenuation of the NDV-VF versus NDV-BC-based constructs.",

In addition, the mucosal antibody response was analyzed by quantitation of SARS-CoV-specific IgA in TL samples (Fig. 3, panel D). We detected NDV-specific serum antibody titers beginning at day 14 after the first dose, which gradually increased at the later time points (Fig. 3A). The highest titers were detected in the NDV-BC IN/IT group, followed in order by NDV-BC/S IN/IT, NDV-VF/S IN/IT and NDV-BC/S IN. The SARS-CoV-specific serum IgG titers were at background levels in all immunized groups after the first dose (Fig. 3B). After the second dose, high titers were detected in 4 of 4 animals in the NDV-BC/S IN/IT and 3 of 4 animals in the NDV-VF/S IN/IT groups, with greater antibody levels in the former group on days 42 and 49. In contrast, after immunization by the IN route only, the IgG titers remained at background level. Similar to what was observed for the IgG responses, substantial SARS-CoV-neutralizing serum antibody responses were detected after the second dose in all 8 animals immunized by the combined IN/IT route with NDV-BC/S or NDV-VF/S, but not in animals immunized by the IN route alone with NDV-BC/S (Fig. 3C). Again, NDV-BC/S induced a greater response, as compared to NDV-VF/S. We also observed an increase in SARS-CoV-specific IgA titer in the TL samples of most of the animals that received vaccine by either the combined IN/IT route or the IN route alone (Fig. 3D). Specifically, all 4 animals that received NDV-BC/S by the combined IN/IT route demonstrated a 3\u20134-fold increase in TL IgA titer by day 42 that was maintained or increased through day 56. The TL IgA response was less consistent in the NDV-VF/S group, in which only 2 of 4 animals demonstrated a 5- and 18-fold increase in TL IgA on day 42 that had largely waned by day 56. Despite the relatively meager humoral responses, all 4 animals that received NDV-BC/S by the IN route alone demonstrated a 2\u20137.5-fold increase in S-specific TL IgA that was largely maintained through day 49, but returned to near background levels by day 56. We were unable to detect statistically significant differences between the groups due to the high animal-to-animal variability.",

On days 1 and 2 post-challenge, NW and TL samples were collected to evaluate viral shedding (Fig. 4), and on day 2 the animals were euthanized and respiratory tract tissues were collected to assess SARS-CoV replication by quantitative virology (Fig. 5), IHC, and histopathologic analysis (Fig. 6). In the control animals, high or moderate titers of SARS-CoV challenge virus were detected in NW and TL samples (Fig. 4) and in respiratory tract tissues (Fig. 5), SARS-CoV antigen was easily detectable by IHC of lung tissue (Fig. 6 top row; Table 1). In the animals immunized by NDV-BC/S or NDV-VF/S by the combined IN/IT route, very little or no SARS-CoV was detected by any of the three methods. In contrast, the group immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN route alone had a level of SARS-CoV shedding that was indistinguishable from that in the control group, and the titer of SARS-CoV detected by direct analysis of lung tissue was largely indistinguishable from that in the control group in most locations, with a modest reduction seen in some sections. Moreover, the level of viral antigen, as evaluated by IHC, was only marginally reduced as compared to the control group. Histopathological examination of bronchial tissues demonstrated a pronounced loss of cilia and increases in cellular infiltration and necrosis and/or apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells following challenge of the NDV-BC control as well as in the NDV-BC/S IN-immunized group, while little or no pulmonary pathology was detected in the IN/IT-immunized groups (Fig. 6, bottom row; Table 1, NDV-VF/S not shown).",

We therefore infected monolayers of DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast cells and LLC-MK2 monkey kidney cells with serial dilutions of NDV-BC and incubated the monolayers under methylcellulose at various temperatures for 4 and 12 days, respectively (Fig. 7A and B). Following incubation, the plaques were visualized as described in Section 2 and the plaque sizes and numbers were determined. Within the range of the temperatures tested, no significant difference in the viral titer was observed (data not shown). However, a dramatic reduction of the plaque size associated with the reduced temperatures was observed in the DF-1 chicken cells and, to a lesser degree, in LLC-MK2 monkey cells (Fig. 7A and B). For example, comparison of plaques sizes at 39 and 32 \u00b0C demonstrated a 77% reduction in size in DF-1 cells and a 43% size reduction in LLC-MK2 cells, suggesting significantly reduced virus growth at lower temperatures. A similarly significant difference was observed when plaques formed at 37 and 32 \u00b0C were compared (Fig. 7A and B). In contrast, the plaque size of HPIV3, a human respiratory pathogen, was equal at 37 and 32 \u00b0C (Fig. 7C).",

Following infection at either MOI, replication of NDV-BC and NDV-BC/S was substantially reduced at 32 \u00b0C, as compared to 39 \u00b0C. In contrast, replication of HPIV3 was not significantly different at the two temperatures at most of the time points. In a separate set of experiments we compared NDV antigen production at 32 \u00b0C or 39 \u00b0C following infection at an MOI of 5 PFU (single-step growth) (Fig. 9A) or 0.001 PFU (multi-step growth) (NDV-BC, Fig. 9B; NDV-BC/S, Fig. 9C). At an MOI of 5, a 24 h-long incubation at 32 \u00b0C clearly resulted in a much lower level of the antigen expression, as compared to 39 \u00b0C (Fig. 9A). The low MOI (0.001 PFU) infection resulted in no detectable viral antigen at 24 h regardless of temperature (Fig. 9B and C). However, at 48 h there was abundant antigen in cell incubated at 39 \u00b0C, but no detectable expression of NDV in cells incubated at 32 \u00b0C. Moreover, we observed reduced antigen accumulation at 72 h in cells incubated at 32 \u00b0C. Taken together, these data indicate that, at the reduced temperatures of the upper respiratory tract of African green monkeys, the ability of NDV to replicate and produce viral antigen is greatly reduced.",

            "text": "These data represent the first direct comparison of immunogenicity and protective efficacy of NDV-vectored vaccine constructs following inoculation by various routes in a non-human primate model. These data suggest that (i) NDV-vectored vaccines require delivery through the respiratory tract, and that parenteral delivery by injection, even with two doses, is ineffective, (ii) for effective respiratory tract immunization, IT delivery is required, and (iii) a mesogenic strain of NDV is only marginally more immunogenic than a modified lentogenic strain containing a polybasic F cleavage site, and the two strains are equally protective. Previously published data in a mouse model demonstrated high immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an NDV-vectored vaccine administered by the IV and IP routes [5]. Although we did not test these particular routes of immunization (because they would not be appropriate for human use), the lack of any detectable response even after two doses delivered by the SC route suggests that delivery through the respiratory tract is a requirement for the immunogenicity of NDV-vectored vaccines in primates. Another study utilizing the mouse model demonstrated greater immunogenicity and protective efficacy with IN immunization, as compared to IV or IP administration [6]. However, as opposed to the primate model, IN inoculation of mice typically results in delivery to both the upper and lower respiratory tract. For example, IN inoculation of 4-week-old BALB/c mice with a 20 \u03bcl or 100 \u03bcl inoculum resulted in delivery of 56% or 81%, respectively, of the inoculum to the lungs [15]. Therefore the mouse model does not allow a distinction between vaccine delivery to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, the already noted low phylogenetic and anatomic relatedness between the mouse and human necessitate the use of more relevant models for assessment of the optimal routes of delivery for an NDV-vectored vaccine.",

However, the lack of significant immunogenicity after IN vaccination alone was surprising. IN delivery has been successfully used to vaccinate humans and non-human primates against human influenza viruses [16], respiratory syncytial virus [17], parainfluenza viruses [18], and vaccinia virus [19]. Why does IN immunization with NDV result in a different outcome? We note that infection of humans or non-human primates with live attenuated vaccines against human influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses results in efficient viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract [17], [22], [23], [24]. In contrast, direct analysis of the respiratory tract tissues after IN/IT immunization of non-human primates with NDV detected the virus in the lungs [10], but not in the nasal turbinates (A.B., B.R.M. and P.L.C., unpublished data). In addition, NDV replicated inefficiently in the lower respiratory tract when administered IN compared to the combined IN/IT routes (Fig. 2). Thus, it appears that, in contrast to the human viruses, avian NDV replicates poorly in the upper respiratory tract of primates, a property that could account for its reduced immunogenicity.",

For example, low transmissibility of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in humans was suggested to be related to the lack of its receptor, sialic acid molecules linked to galactose by an \u03b1-2,3-linkage, in the human upper respiratory tract [20]. Sialic acid also serves as a receptor for NDV receptor-binding protein HN; however, NDV appears to be less restricted than influenza virus in its requirements for certain modifications of the sialic acid molecule receptors [reviewed in [21]], and therefore this explanation seems unlikely.",

            "text": "Another possibility is that NDV replicates poorly in the upper respiratory tract of primates due to the lower temperature at that site, reflecting the adaptation of the virus to birds which, as already noted, have a higher body temperature. The idea that NDV is restricted in the upper respiratory tract due to its lower temperature is supported by the significant reduction in NDV-BC plaque size observed in cell culture during incubation performed at lower temperatures characteristic of the upper respiratory tract in primates; in contrast, no reduction was observed for HPIV3, a human respiratory pathogen (Fig. 7). Moreover, the production of virus during single- and multi-cycle growth experiments was strongly reduced at 32 \u00b0C for NDV-BC and NDV-BC/S but not for HPIV3 (Fig. 8). This was associated with reduced and delayed production of intracellular NDV antigen at 32 \u00b0C (Fig. 9). The observation that the replication of HPIV3 was not reduced at 32 \u00b0C suggests that the reduced expression and replication of NDV at this reduced temperature is an intrinsic property of the virus rather than an artifact due to a reduced cellular metabolism. Thus, the ability of human viruses such as human influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses to efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract provides for spread to the lower respiratory tract, in which dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells are abundantly present. In contrast, we suggest that the inefficient antigen expression and reduced virus production of NDV in the upper respiratory tract of primates results in reduced spread the lower respiratory tract and reduced immune stimulation.",

First, since IN delivery alone appeared to be ineffective in a primate model, nebulizer delivery of these vaccines to the lower respiratory tract may be a viable option for subsequent clinical trials. Nebulizer delivery of the measles vaccine to children was found to be safe, effective and inexpensive [25]. Second, since mesogenic and modified lentogenic strains of NDV appeared to be almost equally immunogenic and equally protective, the choice of strain for development of human vaccines should be based on factors other than immunogenicity. Issues such as safety for humans and for the bird population, as well as the ability to grow the virus to high titers in substrates approved for human vaccine production [reviewed in [4]] will be critical considerations when moving forward into clinical trials with these vaccine candidates.",
