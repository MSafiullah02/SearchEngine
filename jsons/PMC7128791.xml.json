[2]. It has also been suggested that, in synergy with respiratory viral infection, bacterial colonization may contribute to respiratory inflammation. Bisgard et al. [3] reported that neonates who had S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis, or a combination of these organisms, colonizing the hypopharyngeal region were at increased risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma early in life [4].

In one investigation of monthly nasopharyngeal cultures taken from healthy infants from the time of birth, 78% were found to have bacterial colonization during the first 2 years of life [15]. The clinical significance of bacterial colonization has been disputed in the various reports. It is widely accepted that viral infections [19] and bacterial upper respiratory tract infections [20] can exacerbate symptoms of asthma. However, observations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients have suggested that isolation of bacteria from sputum during exacerbations represents chronic colonization, which is an innocent bystander role for the bacteria [21, 22, 23]. In most cases, colonization persists for weeks to months without symptoms [24, 25], but the bacteria may spread contiguously to produce local respiratory tract disease. Even during colonization, bacteria in these airways are in a constant state of turnover, releasing extracellular products, and undergoing lysis with release of a variety of proteins, lipo\u2010oligosaccharides and peptidoglycans [26]. Bacterial products in the airways may be potent stimuli for neutrophil migration thither, and elastase released from these neutrophils can act synergistically with bacterial products and cause further inhibition of tracheobronchial ciliary function.",

In the children with bronchiolitis, although concentrations of IL\u201010 were different in the two groups of children, all clinical manifestations and duration of hospitalization were similar. The predominant cells in the airway in RSV bronchiolitis are neutrophils. Activation of innate immunity against the virus by the promotion of proinflammatory mediators, such as IL\u20106, IL\u201010 and monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20101, and cytokines such as IL\u20106 and interleukin\u20108, correlates with disease severity [27, 28, 29]. A previous study indicated that bacterial colonization did not add specific symptoms to the clinical signs already present in RSV bronchiolitis, except that, in patients with severe disease, those with bacterial colonization required ventilation for a longer period [30]. Our data indicate that coexisting non\u2010invasive bacterial colonization has little impact on the severity of an attack of virus\u2010induced bronchiolitis.",

Moreover, the concentration of IL\u201010 and percentage of neutrophils were similarly found to differ between these two groups. Previous studies have demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage from young children with severe recurrent wheezing [31]. The concentration of IL\u201010 was found to be four times that of CXCL\u20108 and 140 times that of CCL\u20103 in the airways of infants with severe wheezing disease. IL\u201010 acts to recruit monocytes into the lung to help the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils [32].
