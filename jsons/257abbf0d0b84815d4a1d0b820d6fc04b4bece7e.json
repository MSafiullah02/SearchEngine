In particular, we build a new mathematical model which allows to take into account differences in the response of patients to the disease according to their age. This model also allows for a heterogeneous response of the population to the social distancing measures taken by the local government. We fit this model to the observed data and obtain a snapshot of the effective transmissions occurring inside the population at different times, which indicates where and among whom the disease propagates after the start of the public measures.",

Symptoms of this disease include fever, shortness of breath, cough, and a non-negligible proportion of infected individuals may develop severe forms of the symptoms leading to their transfer to intensive care units and, in some cases, death. However it is also worth noting that symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are both infectious [19, 23, 26] making challenging the control of the disease.",

The number of reported cases worldwide exceeded 3 millions as of May 3, 2020 [28] . The heterogeneity of the number of cases and the severity according to the age groups, especially for children and elderly people, aroused the interest of several researchers [3, 17, 14, 20, 21] . Indeed, several studies have shown that the severity of the disease increases with the age and co-morbidity of hospitalized patients [21, 25] . Let us mention that Wu et al. [24] have shown that the risk of developing symptoms increases by 4% by age in adults aged between 30 and 60 years old while Davies et al. [4] found that there is a strong correlation between chronological age and the likelihood of developing symptoms. However let us mention that a higher probability of developing symptoms does not necessarily imply greater infectiousness as completely asymptomatic individuals can also be contagious. In fact in [26] it has been found that the viral load in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients. Moreover while adults are more likely to develop symptoms, it has been shown in [7] that the viral loads in infected children do not differ significantly from those of adults.",

To this end the distribution of contacts between age groups in society (home, workplace, school ...) is an important factor to take into account when modeling the spread of the epidemic. To account for these facts, some mathematical models have been developed in [1, 2, 4, 17, 20] . In [1] the authors studied the dependence of the COVID-19 epidemic on the demographic structures in several countries but did not focus on the contacts distribution of the populations. In [2, 4, 17, 20] a focus on the social contact patterns with respect to the chronological age has been made by using the contact matrices provided in [16] . While [1, 4] used the example of Japan in their study, their approach is significantly different from ours.",

We used data from [29] which is based on reports from national and regional authorities. Patients are labeled \"confirmed\" when tested positive to COVID-19 by PCR. Interestingly, the age class of the patient is provided for 13 660 out of 13970 confirmed patients (97.8% of the confirmed population) as of April 29. The age distribution of the infected population is represented in Figure 1 and compared to the total population per age class (data from the Statistics Bureau of Japan estimate for October 1, 2019). Both datasets are given in Table 1 and a statistical summary is provided by Table 2 . Note that the high proportion of 20-60 years old confirmed patients may indicate that the severity of the disease is lower for those age classes than for older patients, and therefore the disease transmits more easily in those age classes because of a higher number of asymptomatic individuals. Elderly infected individuals might transmit less because they are identified more easily. The cumulative number of death ( Figure 4 ) is another argument in favor of this explanation. We also reconstructed the time evolution of the reported cases in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . Note that the steepest curves precisely concern the 20-60-years old, probably because they are economically active and therefore have a high contact rate with the population. Figure 1 : In this figure we plot in blue the age distribution of the Japanese population for 10 000 people and we plot in orange the age distribution of the number of reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 for 13660 patients on April 29.

In their survey [16] , Prem and co-authors present a way to reconstruct contact matrices from existing data and provide such contact matrices for a number of countries including Japan. Based on the data provided by Prem et al. [16] for Japan we construct the contact probability matrix \u03c6. More precisely, we inferred contact data for the missing age classes [80, 90[ and [90, 100 [. The precise method used to construct the contact matrix \u03b3 is detailed in Appendix B. The precise contact matrix \u03b3 we used is the following 17) where the i th line of the matrix \u03b3 ij is the average number of contact made by an individuals in the age class i with an individual in the age class j during one day. Notice that the higher number of contacts are achieved within the same age class. The matrix of conditional probability \u03c6 of contact between age classes is the following ",

Moreover, our model reveals the fact that the policies used by the government to reduce contacts between individuals have strongly heterogeneous effects depending on the age classes. Plotting the transmission matrix at different times (see Figure 10 ) shows that younger age classes react more quickly and more efficiently than older classes. This may be due to the fact that the number of contacts in a typical day is higher among younger individuals. As a consequence, we predict that one month after the effective start of public measures, the new transmissions will almost exclusively occur in elderly classes.",
