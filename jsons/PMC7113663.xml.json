These technologies are capable of producing millions of sequence reads without a priori knowledge of the sample. Sequence data generated from a sample is compared to known sequence databases in order to identify viruses. Previously, virus metagenomics was accomplished by cloning and sanger-based sequencing of randomly amplified nucleic acid (Breitbart et al., 2003, Djikeng et al., 2008). Despite the small amount of sequence data produced, it was still possible to detect viruses due to either high concentrations, or some process of prior enrichment being applied that removes host cells and exogenous nucleic acid.",

A higher proportion of viral sequence increases the probability that (1) viral sequences will be represented in a metagenomic dataset and (2) larger contigs can be assembled, increasing the likelihood of a match in the database. It is has been shown that without some type of physical enrichment method, viruses may not be present in high enough concentrations to be detected (Daly et al., 2011). This problem is somewhat overcome as high-throughput sequencing technologies advance in both read length and sequencing depth. Nevertheless, gains in sensitivity are still possible by the application of a physical enrichment process for viruses, and may also avoid the cost of generating and analysing additional data.",

However, only a few methodological studies have been applied to evaluate the efficiency of viral enrichment methods in metagenomics that seek to diagnose animal or human disease. A study on human liver tissue compared enrichment techniques of freeze\u2013thaw, centrifugation and nuclease-treatment for the detection of Hepatitis C Virus using both Roche 454 and Illumina high-throughput sequencing platforms (Daly et al., 2011). The abundance of viral sequences in each treatment group was compared to results obtained by quantitative real-time PCR detection of transcripts, and the effect of each treatment method on viral genome coverage was also determined. Such studies show that physical enrichment methods do increase the sensitivity of detection for viruses in metagenomics.",

Methods described for viral ecology studies are unlikely to be applicable. A review was undertaken of 24 published metagenomic studies that sought to describe viruses present in human or animal samples (excluding virus ecology studies) and provide details on the enrichment methods used (Table 1\n). Most of these studies incorporate the use of low-speed centrifugation and/or filtration to remove host cells or other micro-organisms, with a final nuclease-treatment step, where DNAse or RNAse will destroy exogenous nucleic acid but is not thought to affect nucleic acid protected by the viral capsid or envelope. Ultracentrifugation also features as a common method for the concentration of viruses from samples.",

The application of these techniques in a clinical setting will require that any virus enrichment methods are simple to perform, fast, robust, effective, standardised and do not require significant capital expenditure. It is noted that the vast majority of the published studies in Table 1 apply the simple enrichment techniques without any a priori justification for the selection of the technique. This study sought to examine the rapid and simple enrichment techniques for viruses that appear to be in routine use in the literature for diagnosing animal and human diseases, but for which the effects on metagenomic data have not been studied. This was achieved by examining the effect of these enrichment methods on the relative abundance of viruses in a metagenomic dataset derived from a simple and well-characterised artificial sample.",

In the present study, an artificial sample was composed which represents the type of organisms that could possibly be observed in clinical samples i.e. a rectal swab taken from a human patient. Of course, the artificial sample is unlikely to have similar characteristics to complex biological samples from humans or animals. Bacteria are often a very abundant organism in de novo metagenomic datasets, and host sequence is also often present. To this end, E.coli and a human cell line were chosen, as well as two RNA viruses (influenza virus, enterovirus) and a DNA virus (adenovirus). The DNA virus was included to assess the potential for detection when using an RNA virus targeted approach, as many virus discovery projects have to create two workflows to independently target DNA or RNA viruses. Differing amounts of each virus were placed into the artificial sample so as to represent varying concentrations. This artificial sample represents a starting point to evaluate simple and rapid viral enrichment methods for use in virus metagenomics studies that seek to detect a virus that is causing disease in humans or animals. At present, there is little guidance for researchers seeking to work in this area and published studies have often selected these simple enrichment techniques with no justification for their inclusion in the method.",

Despite reductions in the quantity (copy number) of bacterial and human RNA gene targets as shown in the qPCR data, this did not translate into a substantially increased relative abundance for viral sequences in the metagenomic data. The qPCR method detects the absolute quantity of genome target present, whereas the metagenomic data is proportional (relative abundance). Even though large gains can be made in reducing bacteria and human nucleic acid, the proportion of viral sequences in the metagenomic datasets still remained relatively low (i.e. generally less than 1%) except for when a 3-step enrichment method was applied. Nevertheless, individual enrichment methods did have some effect on relative abundance of the model organisms\u2019 representation in the metagenomics data. Nuclease treatment alone was successful in reducing the proportion of human (Metazoa) sequences by 10-fold. It is hypothesised that the initial freeze\u2013thaw processing of the artificial sample has lysed human cells and thus liberated human genome.

However, this may not be the correct explanation as the DNAse treatment used before cDNA synthesis is known to be less than 100% efficient, and some DNA is likely to have been carried right through into the sequencing library preparation.

            "text": "It is noted that the viral metagenomic method chosen uses multiple displacement amplification, and therefore there is likely to be a bias in the amplification of larger genomes e.g. bacteria and host, which could confound results when considering the relative abundance of sequences in the metagenomic data. There are many different methods of amplification that are available and this represents only one. However, this amplification method is one that is in practical use, and has been applied in other virus discovery studies (Cheval et al., 2011), therefore the examination of enrichment techniques using this specific amplification method are still relevant. There is a certainly a need for future studies to expand this work into a full validation, so as to examine the effect of enrichment when using other amplification methods i.e. SISPA, nextera, LAMP, LASL. It would also be interesting to include a greater array of enrichment methods, sample types, sequencing platforms and bioinformatics approaches which may include the incorporation of sequence assembly methods, or the use of other search algorithms. The findings presented here should provide a starting point for those considering the use of rapid or simple enrichment methods for the purposes of diagnosing new viral diseases in human or animal samples by using metagenomics. This study also highlights the possible risks of arbitrarily selecting an enrichment method purely based upon previously published studies.",
