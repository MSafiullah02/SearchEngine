First of all, N protein level determines the transition from RNA transcription to RNA genome replication (Fig. 16.8\n). Earlier in infection, when the N protein level is low, the RNA transcription proceeds. As N protein accumulates later in infection, the N proteins, as a trimeric form, begin to bind to the viral RNA, resulting in formation of a (+) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure, which then serves as a template for viral genome replication. Second, intriguingly, the RNA primer utilized for the viral transcription is snatched from cellular mRNA (Box 16.1\n). In other words, the RNA primer, which is the capped 10\u201318 nt RNA fragment, is obtained by the cap-snatching mechanism, which is reminiscent of influenza virus (see Fig. 15.7).Box 16.1Capping Mechanisms of Diverse RNA VirusesThe cap structure of cellular mRNA is critical for translation, a process called cap-dependent translation. The engagement of eIF4E on the cap is the first step of translation initiation. Thus, cellular mRNAs, transcripts of host RNA polymerase II, are all capped and the capping occurs co-transcriptionally in the nucleus. On the other hand, the majority of viral mRNAs have a cap, as their translation relies on host translation factors. A question that arose was how is the capping achieved by RNA viruses, in which RNAs are transcribed by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), instead of cellular RNA polymerase II? Depending on the RNA viruses, two mechanisms are employed. First, some RNA viruses encode capping enzymes (ie, guanyl transferase and methyl transferase) themselves. This group includes positive-strand RNA viruses such as flavivirus, coronavirus, and negative-strand RNA viruses such as rhabdovirus. Second, some RNA viruses such as influenza virus and bunyavirus snatch the cap structure from cellular mRNAs, a mechanism dubbed cap-snatching. In this case, the virus encodes endonuclease required for the cleavage of the capped RNA (eg, PA endonuclease of influenza virus).\n",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a clinically significant human paramyxovirus, which causes bronchiolitis in children and is the main pathogen for viral pneumonia in children.\u2022\nFilovirus: Ebola virus, the prototype of filoviruses, has one large negative-strand RNA genome (~19 kb). Ebola virus represents the most horrifying pathogen that leads to fatal consequences (~90% fatality).\n\u2022\nBunyavirus: Hantavirus, the prototype of bunyaviruses, has three segmented RNA genome of negative-strand (~12 kb for three segments).\u2022\nArenavirus: Lassa virus, a human arenavirus, has two segmented RNA genome (~11 kb for three segments). Arenavirus genomes are \u201cambisense\u201d in that both strands encode viral proteins. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in an endemic area in Africa: annually 300,000\u2013500,000 infection cases, resulting in 5000 deaths.\u2022\nReovirus: Rotavirus, the prototype of reoviruses, has an 11 segmented RNA genome of dsRNA (~18 kb for 11 segments).
