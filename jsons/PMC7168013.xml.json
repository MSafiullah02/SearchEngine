The coordinator (Elsie Edwards) of Ngunytju Tjitji Pirni Inc (NTP, an Aboriginal Health Service) was chief investigator on our first grant application in 1997 and Aboriginal investigators were part of subsequent funding applications. Formal collaboration with Bega Garnbirringu Aboriginal Health Services Aboriginal Corporation (BEGA) was established in 1999. We learnt that BEGA had limited access to ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists and, therefore, our study ENT specialist (H.C.) offered his services at no cost until another specialist became available. D.L. also assisted BEGA in obtaining funding for an Ear Health Worker and we offered parents and children transport to ENT clinics.",
