Materials and Methods: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed and the relationship between them was analyzed. Results: Totally 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58/80 (73%) of patients had cough, 61/80 (76%) of patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (GGO) (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%) and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12\u00b16 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%) and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index (PII) value was (34%\u00b120%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset and body temperature (p<0.05). Conclusion: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple GGO, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results.

Early identification and early 221 intervention are the keyvital to reduce the incidence and mortality of severe cases. In 222 this study, most patients were adults and there was no significant difference between 223 the numbers of either male orand female. Cough and fever were the most common 224 clinical symptoms.

On the 232 whole, the CT changes of the lung were significantly heavier than the clinical 233 manifestations.in comparison withcompared with other types of pneumonia, 234 COVID-19 seemed to cause milder symptoms and severer pulmonary changes on CT. 235 Most of the patients had mild symptoms and mild temperature rise, but their lung 236 manifestations were serious.

In other words, 238 multiple Multiple and large lesions of two lungs involved simultaneouslyat the same 12 time is not generally spottedpopular in the typical bacterial pneumonia. 14,15 The most 240 common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe, the 241 posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, the lateral basal segment of the right 242 lower lobe, the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe and the posterior basal segment 243 of the left lower lobe.

At present, it is not clear whether it has clinical value in evaluating the 261 13 prognosis of patients. Recently, Pan et al have analyzed the time course of lung 262 changes in 21 mild patients with confirmed COVID-19. They found that the initial 263 lung manifestation was subpleural GGO which turned to consolidation two weeks 264 after the onset of the disease, and then the lesions were gradually absorbed, leaving a 265 wide range of GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands. 17 In another article, the 266 authors found that after 7 days of treatment for the mild patients, there was a 267 significant reduction in GGO on chest CT. On the 13th day after admission, most of 268 the ground glass disappeared. Our patients constituted a complete group with mild, 269 severe and critical types. 19 All patients completed CT examination within two days 270 after admission, which was 7 \u00b1 4 days from the onset of the disease. 271 At present, to our knowledge, all patients have not been examined by pathology 272 in the world, so it is impossible to know the exact pathological manifestations of 273 COVID-19. However, accordingAccording to the morphological changes of the CT 274 features, pathological manifestations could be speculated although there iswas no 275 direct evidence. The ground glass density lesions could be caused by the exudation of 276 alveoli. The appearance of consolidation indicatesindicated that the alveoli wereare 277 completely filled by inflammatory exudation. The thickening of interlobular septum 278 indicatedindicates that the the pulmonary interstitium hashave been involved.

CT 28 plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health 29 Introduction 33 Since the middle of December 2019, many cases of pneumonia with unidentified 34 causes have been found in some hospitals in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. 1 At 35 first, it was reported that a number of patients had certain contact with a large seafood 36 and animal market, which suggested an animal-to-human transmission. Soon 37 afterwards, an increasing number of patients without being exposed to the animal 38 market started to grow exponetially, indicating a fact of human-to-human 39 transmission. At present, this kind of pneumonia has been confirmed as a new type of 40 acute respiratory infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection. 2,3 However, it is 41 not clear how expeditiously and sustainably the virus spreads from person to person. 42 On 12 February, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 43 announced that the official classification of the new coronavirus was severe acute 44 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The same day, the World Health 45 Organization (WHO) announced that the official name of the disease caused by the 46 virus was corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Corona Virus has been spreading rapidly around the world, infecting no fewer than seventy thousands people, 48 and leading to a certain degree of public panic. 4-6 On January 30, 2020, the 49 International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the WHO declared the 50 outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concernexternal icon\" (PHEIC).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF19": {"text": "The epidemic caused by the new coronavirus has become a public health emergency 52 of international concern. 53 The SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus which has never been found in 54 human body before.

Besides, a small number of 56 patients could have nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

On the 202 whole, in comparison with other types of pneumonia, COVID-19 seemed to cause 203 milder symptoms and severer pulmonary changes on CT. Most of the patients had 204 mild symptoms and mild temperature rise, but their lung manifestations were serious. 205 Multiple lesions were found in multiple segments and lobes of both lungs, which was 206 different from the bacterial pneumonia.

For CT 215 features, GGO was the most common of all the abnormalities, followed by 216 consolidation and interlobular septal thickening. This is consistent with the results of 217 the recently published studies. 16-18 Occasionally the subpleural line and bronchial wall 218 thickening could be seen whereas pleura effusion, pericardial effusion or lymph node 219 enlargement were rare to identify. Some of the GGO was characterized by the 220 reticular interlobular septa thickening, which was called \"crazy paving pattern\". It 221 resulted from the alveolar edema and interstitial inflammatory of acute lung injury, 222 which had been reported in SARS. 9,10 In another situation, some of the GGO showed 223 a triangular or angular shape under the pleura with the internal interlobular septa 224 thickened like a net.

It is a specific sign for COVID-19, which has 227 not been reported in other diseases in the literature. At present, it is not clear whether 228 it has clinical value in evaluating the prognosis of patients. Recently, Pan et al have 229 analyzed the time course of lung changes in 21 mild patients with confirmed 230 COVID-19. They found that the initial lung manifestation was subpleural GGO which 231 turned to consolidation two weeks after the onset of the disease, and then the lesions 232 were gradually absorbed, leaving a wide range of GGO and subpleural parenchymal 233 bands. 17 In another article, the authors found that after 7 days of treatment for the mild 234 patients, there was a significant reduction in GGO on chest CT. On the 13th day after 235 admission, most of the ground glass disappeared. Our patients constituted a complete 236 group with mild, severe and critical types. 19 All patients completed CT examination 237 within two days after admission, which was 7 \u00b1 4 days from the onset of the 238 disease. 239 At present, to our knowledge, all patients have not been examined by pathology 240 in the world, so it is impossible to know the exact pathological manifestations of 241 COVID-19. However, according to the morphological changes of the CT features, 242 pathological manifestations could be speculated although there was no direct evidence. 243 The ground glass density lesions could be caused by the exudation of alveoli. The 244 appearance of consolidation indicated that the alveoli were completely filled by 245 inflammatory exudation.

In the late stage of acute respiratory 247 distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar and interstitium damage may occur. 248 The COVID-19 needs to be differentiated from other diseases, such as SARS and 249 MERS. They all showed multiple ground glass shadows and solid lesions in both 250 lungs, mainly distributed under the pleura, which were difficult to distinguish. 20-22 251 However, SARS and MERS had faster disease progress and heavier lung damages 252 than COVID-19 infection did.

First 262 of all, this was a retrospective study involving a small number of patients with proven 263 SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, none of the patients had a lung biopsy or autopsy 264 to reflect the histopathological changes. Thirdly, this study was a cross-sectional 265 study and we could not analyze the dynamic CT changes in different stages.
