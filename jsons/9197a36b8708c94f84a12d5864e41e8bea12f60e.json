Therefore, it may raise the level of discussions on disputed shelf zones where the deposits are located, especially near to Norway-Russia sea border. Secondly, oil and gas excavation leads to potential threats to fishing by changing natural habitats, which in turn can create serious damage to the economies. We construct a model, which helps to highlight potential disputed territories and analyze preferences of the countries interested in fossil fuels and fish resources. We also compare different scenarios of resource allocation with allocation by current agreement.",

Generally, the adjusted winner procedure is used for fair division of divisible goods. However, since we do not allow shared allocation of areas, the final allocation of areas does not guarantee that the satisfaction level of each country will be equal.
