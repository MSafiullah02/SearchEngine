By virtue of its small size (27 nt), B2(\u00c0)26G is amenable to studies with proton NMR. NMR analysis requires the RNA to be in one predominant conformation. Since the regions forming intramolecular base-pairing can have high potential to form a dimeric conformation through intermolecular base-pairing, it is important to ensure that the RNA forms a stable monomeric conformation. To examine this, UV melting experiments were done with B2(\u00c0)26G over a 30-fold concentration range. Melting temperature (t m ) for the major transition was estimated at 55.6(AE0.5) C, and did not change appreciably over a concentration ranging from 2 to 60 mM, indicating that B2(\u00c0)26G has a monomeric conformation. In addition, native gel analysis was performed to determine the number of electrophoretically distinct conformations of B2(\u00c0)26G that may exist. As a control, a 17 nt RNA that exists both as a monomer and a dimer was used (Figure 1(a) , lane 1).

We sought to con\u00aerm or modify this predicted structure using the results obtained from NMR analysis. Although solving a complete tertiary structure at atomic resolution using NMR is a time-consuming process, one-dimensional (1D) imino NMR and two dimensional NMR spectra of an RNA molecule can be used to determine RNA secondary structure (Varani & Tinoco, 1991) . When the imino protons are involved in base-pairing or forming an unusual conformation, they are usually protected from fast proton exchange with the water solvent, resulting in sharp imino proton peaks. If those protected imino protons are located within a 5 A \u00ca space, the crosspeaks between imino peaks can be observed by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (2D NOESY), where protected imino protons in guanine and uracil bases will result in a NOE in a NOESY spectrum (Variani & Tinoco, 1991) and allow the assignment of nucleotides in base-pairs. As seen in Figure 1 (b), the proposed secondary structure contains eight base-pairs with a U\u00c1 U mismatch and a CUU tri-loop. If this structure is the major conformation in solution, we should be able to see major imino peaks from the two A \u00c1 U, four G\u00c1 C, and one G\u00c1 U base-pair. The terminal A \u00c1 U base-pair might not be stable due to increased\u00afexibility caused by the adjacent 5 H and 3 H overhangs. More than eight imino peaks are observed in the 1D imino spectrum (Figure 1(c) ), which indicates that the 27 nt RNA may have unusually protected imino peaks or some minor conformation that can be clari\u00aeed by analyzing 2D water NOESY crosspeak pattern.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 86, "end": 107, "text": "(Jaeger et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 473, "end": 496, "text": "(Varani & Tinoco, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 990, "end": 1014, "text": "(Variani & Tinoco, 1991)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 128, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1089, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1550, "text": "(Figure 1(c)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The crosspeak pattern shown in the 2D H 2 O NOESY (Figure 1(d) ) would allow us to discern between G\u00c1 C and A \u00c1 U base-pairs using the characteristic crosspeaks between the uracil imino and adenine H2 in the A \u00c1 U base-pair, and the crosspeaks between guanine imino and cytosine amino protons in the G \u00c1C base-pair, respectively. The expected G\u00c1 U wobble base-pair was discerned by its characteristic strong crosspeaks between G and U imino protons.

Mutant endscripts were all quanti\u00aeed after transcription and puri\u00aecation as described by . In essence, one picomole of each endscript was subjected to RNA synthesis assay and the amount of product synthesized was normalized to that produced by wildtype B2(\u00c0)26G. B2(\u00c0)26G yielded a predominant product of 26 nt, and some minor amounts of RNA one nucleotide longer and shorter due to non-templated nucleotide addition and premature termination, respectively (Figure 2(a), lanes 2-3). All three products initiated from the 1 cytidylate, since its change to a guanylate abolished all synthesis ( Figure 2 (a), lanes 4-5). Products directed by several of the mutant endscripts are shown in Figure 2 (a) (lanes 6-15). Approximately 50 mutant endscripts were characterized according to the following scheme. To get an impression of the sequences important for RNA synthesis, a series of three nucleotide transitions starting at the 3 H end up to position 21 were carried out. In general, mutations within the \u00aerst seven positions relative to the 3 H end of the template have a more severe effect on RNA synthesis than mutations from position 8 to 15 (Figure 2(b) ). Some mutations near the 5 H terminus also decreased RNA synthesis. We have previously analyzed the effect of changes in positions between 17 and 24 and found that sequence within this region is required for ef\u00aecient RNA synthesis in a yet undetermined mechanism (Sivakumaran & Kao, 1999) . We decided to focus on position 2 to 8 because this sequence is likely to be directly involved in the initiation process (Sun et al., 1996; Sun & Kao, 1997a,b) . We consequently tested every possible single nucleotide substitution from position 1 to 9, along with at least one change at position 10 to 21. In contrast to the BMV subgenomic promoter, where changes at key positions drastically reduced RNA synthesis , we found that none of the substitutions prevented RNA synthesis except for a C/G change at the initiation site. However, position 4 to 7 were comparatively sensitive to substitutions. Interestingly, while single nucleotide substitutions of either the 6 or 7 guanylates with cytidylates resulted in low levels of synthesis, replacement of both guanylates with cytidylates in Figure 1 .

Also, all except B3(\u00c0)26G possess a loop region rich in pyrimidines. If such a loop motif is necessary for RNA synthesis, it is not suf\u00aecient since SS1, SS2, and several other mutant endscripts that retain such a motif are debilitated for RNA synthesis. Finally, we note that while the RNAs are predicted to vary in the lengths of the stems from six (assuming a uridylate-uridylate base-pair in several of the endscripts) to nine base-pairs, they are all capable of directing RNA synthesis (Figure 4 (a)).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 289, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1237, "text": "Figure.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1315, "text": "Figure.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1725, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2431, "end": 2440, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "To examine whether the predicted stability of the secondary structure is correlated to the ability to direct RNA synthesis, a plot of the calculated \u00c1G from the mfold program for all mutants endscripts were plotted against their ability to direct RNA synthesis (Figure 4(b) ).

Two extremely unstable endscripts did result in inef\u00aecient RNA synthesis (Figure 4(b) ). Nonetheless, no consistent correlation between RNA stability and the ability to direct RNA synthesis was observed. For example, endscript 10 C/U (\u00c1G 3.4 kcal/mol) is predicted to have lower stability than B2(\u00c0)26G (\u00c1G 3.9 kcal/mol), but was nonetheless more ef\u00aecient in directing RNA synthesis.

The shape of the melting curve for B2(\u00c0)26G, 3 U/A and 9 G/A suggests that they melted with multiple step transition, while 6,7 G/C undergoes a single step transition between two states ( Figure 5(a) ). With a crude estimate of the relative increase in absorbance and the magnitude of the slope for each transition, it seems that B2(\u00c0)26G, 3U/A and 9G/A underwent a relatively sharp major transition and then a broad minor transition at higher temperatures ( Figure 5(a) ). The multiple transitions might be due to differential melting of secondary structure elements or the unstacking of the bases in the single-stranded portions of the RNAs. The absence of multiple transitions in 6,7G/C clearly shows that it has distinct thermodynamic properties from the other endscripts, implying a different conformation. In addition, even among B2(\u00c0)26G, 3 U/A and 9 G/A, the overall shapes of the melting curves look different, which indicates that these RNAs undergo different unfolding processes. These results are consistent with the native gel analysis and suggest that the three mutant endscripts are altered in their secondary structures in comparison to B2(\u00c0)26G and to each other. To characterize the changes in the structures of the mutant endscripts more precisely, 1D imino spectra were taken at different temperatures ( Figure 5(b) ). The quality of the ca 12 peaks characteristic of B2(\u00c0)26G were signi\u00aecantly affected by temperature. The peaks were relatively sharp at 20 C (data not shown), but became increasingly broad at 30 C and 40 C, indicating that exchange with the environment of some of the imino protons increased at higher temperatures ( Figure 5(b) ). For ease of description, several of the imino peaks have been named in the spectra of B2(\u00c0)26G ( Figure 5(b) ). Of interest is the U8-U16 interaction at approximately 11 and 9.7 ppm. This interaction appeared to be more sensitive to temperature changes compared to interactions associated with G \u00c1C base-pairs at approximately 13-13.4 ppm. Endscript 3U/A has only \u00aeve of the peaks associ-ated with B2(\u00c0)26G ( Figure 5(b) ). At 20 C, the U8-U16 interaction was retained in 3 U/A, as were the peaks associated with G \u00c1 C base-pairs adjacent to the U8-U16 interaction. However, missing were the base-pairs at the bottom of stem A, as exempli-\u00aeed by the absence of the U5 peak at 14.4 ppm. At 40 C, all the peaks were signi\u00aecantly broadened in comparison to those from B2(\u00c0)26G, indicating that the mutation in 3U/A RNA destabilizes the structure of the RNA. Endscript 6,7 G/C gave a number of sharp peaks that do not correspond to the ones observed in B2(\u00c0)26G ( Figure 5(b) ), indicating that 6,7 G/C exists in a different structural conformation than B2(\u00c0)26G. The structure predicted for 6,7 G/C by the mfold program was different from that for B2(\u00c0)26G (Figure 4(b) ). In addition, since the peaks from 6,7 G/C remain well de\u00aened at 40 C, its conformation is more (Jaeger et al., 1989) . These structures were selected because they contain stems and loops that are useful to compare with those from B2(\u00c0)26G. The amount of synthesis directed by each endscript is shown as a percentage relative to that of B2(\u00c0)26G. The \u00c1G in kcal/mol of the predicted structure was calculated by the mfold program. Endscripts SS1 and SS2, (within the box), denote B2(\u00c0)26G RNA derivatives with compensatory nucleotide changes on both sides of the main stem. These were the only two mutant derivatives of B2(\u00c0)26G shown here that were signi\u00aecantly debilitated for RNA synthesis. The Other RNA derivatives are described in the legend to Figure 2 (b) and in the text. (b) A plot of relative RNA synthesis versus the calculated \u00c1G value of the predicted secondary structures for all of mutant endscripts tested in this study. The value for B2(\u00c0)26G is denoted by a white diamond and the two endscripts with the least and most stable predicted secondary structures able to direct ef\u00aecient RNA synthesis are indicated by arrows. stable than that of B2(\u00c0)26G. This observation is consistent with its UV melt properties ( Figure 5(a) ). Endscript 9 G/A RNA, like 3 U/A RNA, retained a subset of the imino peaks observed in B2(\u00c0)26G, mostly corresponding to those in stem A (Figures 1(d) and 5(b) ). However, these peaks are different from those observed in 3 U/A RNA. Most notably, the U8-U16 signal was drastically broadened, indicating the absence of the U8-U16 interaction adjacent to the mutation at position 9. Compared with the spectrum taken at 20 C (data not shown), most peaks were shifted and broadened signi\u00aecantly at 30 C ( Figure 5(b) ). At 35 C, all the peaks were severely broadened, indicating a rapid exchange of the imino protons with the environment due to destabilization of its conformation. Taken together, the biophysical characterization strongly suggest that the predominant structure in B2(\u00c0)26G RNA was signi\u00aecantly altered by the introduced mutations. Therefore, the ability of endscripts to direct RNA synthesis by the BMV replicase under conditions that affect RNA conformation is of interest.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2987, "end": 3008, "text": "(Jaeger et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 250, "text": "Figure 5(a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 510, "end": 521, "text": "Figure 5(a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1386, "text": "Figure 5(b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1718, "text": "Figure 5(b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1830, "text": "Figure 5(b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2142, "text": "Figure 5(b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2693, "text": "Figure 5(b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2888, "text": "(Figure 4(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3641, "end": 3649, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4120, "end": 4131, "text": "Figure 5(a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4271, "end": 4293, "text": "(Figures 1(d) and 5(b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4634, "end": 4645, "text": "Figure 5(b)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Biochemical and biophysical studies on the conformations of endscript RNAs"}, {"text": "We examined the effect of temperature on RNA synthesis using B2(\u00c0)26G and the three mutant endscripts.

This mild reduction in \u00c020/15 synthesis is consistent with our previous observations that the initiation site is required for recognition by the BMV replicase (Sivakumaran & Kao, 1999 ).

Since there are no sequences in common for genomic plus and subgenomic RNA synthesis except for the initiation cytidylate, it is likely that both promoters are recognized before stable RNA structures can be formed in the nascent RNA.

In this model, when minus-strand RNA synthesis reaches the BMV RNA3 intercistronic sequence encoding the subgenomic promoter, the replicase is faced with a roadblock that signals the replicase to either continue copying the template RNA or reverse course and de novo initiate subgenomic RNA synthesis from the nascent RNA. Overcoming this roadblock may depend on the ability of the replicase to successfully pass the intercistronic sequence, which in several bromoviruses contain an unusual homopolymeric sequence (Marsh et al., 1988; Allison et al., 1988 Allison et al., , 1989 Romero et al., 1992) or contain stable stem-loop structures in other viruses (Zavriev et al., 1996; Koev et al., 1999) , or stable RNA-RNA interactions (Kim & Hemenway, 1999; Sit et al., 1998) . The replicases that cannot pass the intercistronic sequence would release the template RNA and initiate subgenomic RNA synthesis from the recently synthesized nascent RNA. The precise initiation position would be determined by the speci\u00aec key nucleotides present in the subgenomic core promoter . Bujarski et al. (1994) have noted that the BMV intercistronic sequence is a region for frequent template switching, and Nagy et al. (1999) have demonstrated that the AU content of a template may promote recombination, a process that depends on template switching.

For plus-strand RNA viruses the genomic RNA is present in the infected cell prior to its translation and assembly of the replicase. Since all molecules prefer to exist in a lower energy state, the viral genomic RNA would possess highly ordered secondary and tertiary structures, which may be formed with the assistance of sequence-non-speci\u00aec RNA-folding chaperons or sequence-speci\u00aec RNA-binding cofactors (Weeks, 1997) , such as the BMV 1a protein (Sullivan & Ahlquist, 1999) . Hence, the replicase needs to recognize the highly structured genomic RNA to initiate minus-strand synthesis. The differences in the incidence of guanylates and cytidylates ( Figure 8 ) provide another indication of the differences between minus and plus-strand RNA synthesis.

Transcription studies using DNA templates indicate that the template sequence could affect the proportion of RNAs that are successfully transcribed to completion (Keene & Luse, 1999; Nudler et al., 1997; Von Hippel & Yager, 1991) . A similar strategy may regulate RNA synthesis from RNA templates.

Consistent with this testable hypothesis, we observed that guanylates and cytidylates negatively affected RNA synthesis when they were within four positions of the initiation nucleotide. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, however, is the fact that substitutions with guanylate and cytidylates do not have identical effects (Figure 2(b) ). Stability of the template-nascent strand duplex is also affected by the contributing effects of the neighboring nucleotides (Turner et al., 1988) , and a cytidylate substitution at a given position may not have the same thermodynamic effect as a guanylate.
