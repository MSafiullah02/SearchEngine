Molecular methods directly assay for the presence of the microorganism at the time the specimen is obtained, which is ideal for the acutely ill patient. Serologic methods assay for an antibody response to the microorganism, typically requiring at least a week of symptoms even for immunoglobulin M tests. Immune-compromised and immune-suppressed patients frequently will not mount an appropriate antibody response. Thus for serologic assays, evaluation of the patient early in the course of the disease or testing a patient with immune dysregulation will often yield false-negative results. Patients who have been treated with intravenous immunoglobulin in the preceding year will typically have immunoglobulin G present against a wide array of infectious agents that they have never seen, which can lead to false-positive serologic tests. Optimal serologic evaluation typically requires retesting at 4 to 6 weeks after infection (ie, convalescent titers) to demonstrate an increase in titer associated temporally with the recent illness, further delaying a definitive diagnosis.",

Many infectious agents cannot be grown by standard culture methodologies (eg, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or are fastidious (eg, Bordetella pertussis), leading to frequent false-negative results. Other organisms grow very slowly (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) such that culture results are not available for weeks. Most clinical microbiology laboratories cannot afford to offer virology services owing to the high expense of performing tissue culture because it is labor intensive, requiring highly skilled laboratory personnel and the purchase of tissue culture cell lines every week that may not be used. Even when available, virus culture typically requires 3 to 10 days for results, depending on the particular virus. However, for the vast majority of bacterial pathogens culture still remains the gold standard of diagnosis, typically yielding a microbiological diagnosis in 1 to 3 days followed by antibiotic susceptibility results. Molecular methods to assay for resistance genes are being developed for some organisms, but are generally not available at this time.",

Each section is further divided between diagnostics most appropriate for normal hosts, then additional diagnostics pertinent to immune-compromised hosts. Thus, diagnostics for the normal host will usually also be relevant to immune-compromised hosts. Before addressing infections of the various organs systems, a brief overview is provided of the principle behind the most common molecular assay currently in use in diagnostic laboratories for pathogen detection, real-time PCR.

            "text": "While a variety of molecular methods exist in diagnostic microbiology, PCR is by far the most universal methodology used for pathogen detection.2 In recent years real-time PCR, also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR), has become the \u201cgo-to\u201d technique in the clinical laboratory (reviewed in Ref.1). In contrast to conventional PCR, which simply amplifies a targeted DNA molecule, real-time PCR can detect, amplify, and quantify a targeted DNA molecule in real time. In real-time PCR, fluorescent dyes are used to label PCR products during thermal cycling. Real-time PCR instruments then measure the accumulation of fluorescent signal during the exponential phase of the reaction for rapid and precise quantitation of PCR products. Quantitation can yield absolute numbers of copies of a given sequence or a relative amount when standardized to a known amount of DNA. Clinically this is particularly useful, for example, in determining viral load from plasma or serum of an individual infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).3 Fluorescence-based diagnostic real-time PCR assays are now available in-house as well as commercially (approved by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) for many human pathogens (reviewed in Ref.1). By virtue of its ability to simultaneously detect and quantify in a sealed PCR plate with no post-PCR processing steps, real-time PCR lends itself to automation and rapid turnaround time while reducing human error. In addition, multiplex real-time PCR assays on the same automated instrument to simultaneously detect and screen for a variety of pathogens are currently under development and are expected in time to replace stand-alone assays for specific pathogens.4 Despite these exciting possibilities, the cost of such multiplex instrumentation is a significant limitation for many smaller clinical laboratories. This review focuses on the individual real-time PCR assays that are currently widely available in the diagnosis of infectious disease emergencies.",

Bacterial meningitis remains the most dangerous and treatable form, such that cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) should always be tested for bacterial culture.5 These molecular diagnostic tests will be most informative for testing CSF to identify the presence of genetic or antigenic material of microorganisms. However, if CSF cannot be obtained, many of these tests can also be performed on blood. For meningoencephalitis in the normal host, herpes simplex virus (HSV)6 and enterovirus7 testing have become routine tests on CSF in many centers. Bacterial antigen testing has been available for decades, but the accuracy of this test remains poor, resulting in limited clinical utility. Molecular diagnostic tests are unlikely to yield an origin in the setting of postinfectious encephalitis because the inciting microorganism is no longer present.",

Unfortunately, in the case of bacterial meningitis molecular techniques to identify the etiologic agent are currently lacking. In the absence of reliable CSF cultures (eg, antibiotic therapy before lumbar puncture), identification of suspected pathogens has traditionally depended on the use of assays such as the latex agglutination or related immunochromatographic membrane assays for the direct qualitative detection of antigens to common bacterial pathogens causing meningitis (eg, Haemophilus influenzae B, Neisseria meningitides, Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In the latex agglutination assay, for example, specific antibodies are bound to the surface of the latex particles on a slide. On addition of the specimen, visible agglutination occurs when the specimen containing any of these bacterial antigens reacts with its respective antibody-coated latex bead. As this assay is completely dependent on accumulation of polysaccharide antigen in the specimen, many false negatives can occur and sensitivity remains a critical issue. In addition, antigen in the sample can come from organism colonization of mucosal surfaces, leading to false-positive results.8\n",

These tests are popular in that they can provide a result within 15 minutes or less, and many such commercially available tests are approved for office/bedside use. Disadvantages of the test include suboptimal test sensitivity, resulting in false-negative results, especially in periods when influenza activity is high. In addition, although specificity is high, false-positive results may also occur when influenza activity, and therefore pretest probability, is low.12 The H1N1 2009 pandemic strain was poorly detected by standard RIDT at the time, leading to development of reverse-transcription PCR technology to identify this strain.13 The reference standards for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection are currently viral culture or real-time PCR.",

In the case of influenza and RSV, the rapid antigen assays can be verified with real-time PCR. Given that influenza A/B and RSV may cause illness that is clinically indistinguishable, a real-time PCR panel test that includes both influenza A/B and RSV (Mayo Diagnostic Test: PROD) should be considered. As already mentioned, innovative PCR-based multiplex molecular diagnostic tests are currently under development that can screen multiple respiratory pathogens at once. For example, the eSensor instrument (GenMark Dx, Carlsbad, CA) can identify the following pathogens in its respiratory viral panel: Influenza A (generic), Influenza A (H1 Seasonal Subtype), Influenza An H1 Mexico strain, Influenza A (H3 Seasonal Subtype) Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtypes A and B, Parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, Adenoviruses B, C, and E, and Coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. Currently being considered for FDA approval, this technology has the ability to allow clinical laboratories to rapidly identify the causative agent in a matter of hours. The recent development of PCR assays for Pneumocystis\n19 and Aspergillus\n20 in immune-compromised hosts will likely improve detection over current technologies.",

It is important to recognize that there may be variation between results obtained from one laboratory and another laboratory.

            "text": "In the setting of infectious disease emergencies, rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent is critical to optimizing antimicrobial therapy in a timely manner. It is clearly evident that the age of molecular diagnostics is now upon us, with real-time PCR becoming the standard of diagnosis for many infectious disease emergencies in either monoplex or multiplex format. Other molecular techniques such as whole or partial genome sequencing, microarrays, broad-range PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and molecular typing are also being used. However, for most small clinical laboratories, implementation of these advanced molecular techniques is not feasible owing to the high cost of instrumentation and reagents. If these tests are not available in-house, samples can be sent to national reference laboratories (eg, Mayo Medical Laboratories and Quest Diagnostics) for real-time PCR assays that can be completed in 1 day. It is anticipated that over time commercial real-time PCR tests and instrumentation will become more standardized and affordable, allowing individual laboratories to conduct tests locally, thus further reducing turnaround time. Although real-time PCR has been proved to expand our diagnostic capability, it must be stressed that such molecular methodology constitutes only an additional tool in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in emergency situations. Phenotypic methodologies (staining, cultures, biochemical tests, and serology) still play a critical role in identifying, confirming, and providing antibiotic susceptibility testing for many microbial pathogens. As multiplex assays become increasingly available, there will be even greater temptation for taking a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach to diagnostic testing. These new technologies will not substitute for a proper history and physical examination leading to a thoughtful differential diagnosis. None the less, these new molecular tests increase the capability of the diagnostician to rapidly identify the microbiological etiology of an infection. An added advantage of rapid diagnostic tests often not emphasized is the capability to rule out certain diagnoses for which unnecessary antimicrobial therapy may otherwise be instituted and/or continued.",
