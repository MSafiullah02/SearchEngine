Clinical findings of influenza A 2009 (H1N1) virus infection were similar to those of seasonal influenza, with many patients having mild illness [5]. However, severe cases occurred, with over 18,000 patients dying throughout the world. Among hospitalized patients with severe influenza A 2009 (H1N1), 15\u201320% were immunosuppressed [6, 7]. Given the behavior of seasonal flu in ISP, a higher number of influenza-related complications in this population could be expected [3, 6, 8, 9]. However, data regarding clinical features and outcomes in non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ISP are needed. The objective of this investigation was to prospectively characterize the clinical manifestations and outcomes of influenza A 2009 (H1N1) virus infection in ISP.",

Peck et al. [14], in a study of seasonal influenza in HSCT recipients, observed that most patients presented upper respiratory symptoms with few systemic symptoms, such as fever or myalgia. Studies carried out in the transplant setting showed diverse results, with a high proportion of patients having low respiratory and systemic symptoms [1, 9]. The clinical findings of pandemic influenza A 2009 (H1N1) infection in different groups of ISP have been reported. A recent study reported that patients with cancer had fever and cough in almost all cases, with lower respiratory tract involvement occurring in 27% of them [15]. George et al. [16] reported 13 cases of influenza A 2009 (H1N1) infection occurring in HSCT recipients, with lower respiratory tract disease in 38.7% of the patients. In solid-organ transplant recipients, a retrospective study of 154 adults with influenza A showed similar clinical findings, with one-third of the patients having pneumonia [17]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compares the clinical manifestation according to the presence of immunosuppression, and we observed that, although the clinical symptoms and signs were very similar, laboratory disturbances such as neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and renal insufficiency were more frequent in the ISP. Some of these, such as renal insufficiency or anemia, were present before the influenza episode and are probably related to the underlying disease and therapy of the ISP, while others, such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia, significantly worsen after influenza infection, possibly due to an effect of the viral infection in this type of patient.",

[1], in a series of ISP with seasonal influenza, observed that most of the cases were mild. Schnell et al. [3], in a retrospective study of hospitalized ISP with seasonal influenza, reported that one-half of the patients had a pneumonia and one-third of patients were admitted to the ICU, with a 10% mortality rate. Other studies carried out in ISP with seasonal influenza report a mortality rate ranging from 0 to 25% [1, 8, 19]. Severe influenza A H1N1 infection has been associated with IgG2 deficiency [20]. In the present study, although there were no differences in some outcome variables, such as admission to ICUs, progression to lower respiratory tract or septic shock, the risk of death during the influenza episode was four times higher in the ISP. However, the severity and outcome of the infection deferred according to the degree of immunosuppression: patients with corticosteroid therapy presented less frequently analytical disturbances and complicated diseases with a better outcome, while oncohematological patients had higher mortality, especially those profoundly neutropenic.",

In the present study, the proportion of patients co-infected was higher in ISP, and this was especially important in those with complicated diseases, where three-quarters of cases presented a bacterial co-infection. The isolated bacteria were also different from non-ISP, with a higher proportion of gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus infections. Co-infection by these microorganisms is probably related to the close contact of these patients with healthcare facilities. The high frequency of co-infection in severe cases and the presence of \u201cnon-strict\u201d community-acquired respiratory pathogens would determine, according to the local epidemiology, the need for using broad-spectrum antibacterial agents in severe cases of influenza A 2009 (H1N1) in ISP.",

In the present study, all patients with complicated diseases started therapy beyond the first 48 h of symptoms. Indeed, this was the only modifiable risk factor of complicated influenza A 2009 (H1N1) infection in this population. Although the proportion of patients receiving antiviral therapy was much higher than that described in series of seasonal influenza [1, 9], an effort should be made to decrease the time of onset of antiviral therapy. For this reason, during epidemiological risk periods, ISP should be screened for symptoms and early influenza diagnosis and therapy should be considered in those cases with compatible syndromes or pneumonia.",

Second, susceptibility to oseltamivir was not performed, and, therefore, we cannot determine if oseltamivir resistance was associated with complicated diseases. Finally, as the outcome of influenza A 2009 (H1N1) infection was not previously known, it is possible that the decision of hospitalizing ISP was not only related to the severity of the underlying disease and to the degree of complications detected, but also to general caution regarding the management of these patients, and milder cases than in non-ISP patients would have been hospitalized.",
