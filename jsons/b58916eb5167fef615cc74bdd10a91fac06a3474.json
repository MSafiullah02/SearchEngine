Moreover, firm-specific factors (past history and firm size) and situational factor (media attention) were found to influence the magnitude of the impact.

The association between food safety events and firms has been recognized in the business and economics literature. The impact of foodborne illnesses on firms has been examined from various perspectives, such as consumer demand (Piggott and Marsh, 2004; Hammit and Haninger, 2007) and changes in purchase intention (Maynard et al., 2008) .

While those measures cannot promptly capture the impact of food safety events, stock prices and stock returns show immediate market reactions based on the market's evaluation of the seriousness of potential impacts on a firm's profitability. Acknowledging that many food safety events occur accidentally, the need to examine immediate responses from the stock market is increasing.

Because every event occurs in different circumstances, there are several factors, risk-related, firm-specific, and situational, that may influence the impact of events. First, risk-related factors are fundamental factors influencing consumers' perceptions of the food safety event. For example, the severity of risk or the number of people sickened may influence the magnitude of the impact on associated firms. Whether a firm executes a recall of products or not may also affect the duration of the impact. Second, firm-specific factors, such as firm size or past history, also influence the impact of food safety events. For instance, whether a firm has a past history with foodborne illness outbreaks may influence consumers' perceptions of the food safety event. Finally, situational factors may affect the seriousness and duration of the food safety event's impact on firms. The proliferation of the Internet enables information to be spread quickly and broadly, which can foster crisis communication. However, negative or distorted information can also spread even quicker than positive or correct information. In this sense, the level of media attention may heavily influence consumer responses, which are reflected in the market evaluation of a firm. The more media attention an event garners, the more negative responses are associated with the firm, which can negatively impact firm value.

To fill the research gap, this study examines whether food safety events have a significant impact on the stock returns of food-related firms. Specifically, the objectives of this study are (1) to examine the magnitude and duration of impacts of food safety events on the market returns of food-related firms and (2) to identify risk-related factors, firm-specific factors, and situational factors that contribute to stock price movements of food-related firms in response to food safety events. In view of the lack of research on the financial impact of food safety events, this study contributes to the literature by extending our understanding of the consequences of food safety events and by providing empirical evidence of the duration of the impacts for food-related firms. This study also offers important information that may help crisis managers design and implement effective crisis communication strategies.

While a number of studies were conducted from a consumer demand perspective, the financial impacts of food safety events on firm performances have garnered little attention. For example, an event study by Henson and Mazzocchi (2002) examined the impacts of government announcements regarding a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is commonly called mad cow disease, and human health on agriculture economies in U.K. The study found that the government announcement caused significantly negative abnormal returns not only for beef processors, but also for processors of dairy products, animal feed, and pet foods as well. The study suggested that abnormal stock returns signal negative impacts of food safety events by reflecting immediate market evaluations of the firm's future value. Moreover, the authors highlighted the need to consider an extended period rather than a single day in assessing the effect of food safety related information on market evaluations. Because the impact of food safety related information on consumer demand can be delayed due to the continuous process of information collection and assimilation in response to uncertainty, examining longer-term cumulative abnormal returns is necessary.

SCCT asserted that a history of crises has an indirect effect on the relationship between crisis responsibility and reputational threat to an organization (Coombs, 2004) . A past crisis similar to a current crisis indicates that the crisis occurs regularly rather than irregularly, resulting in higher crisis attribution or responsibility. If a firm is perceived as highly responsible for a crisis outbreak, people are more likely to have a negative reaction compared to a firm with no crisis history. Due to the influence of past crisis history on reputational threat, a firm must determine its crisis response strategies accordingly. This notion is used to design theory-based matching systems between response strategy and crisis situation in order to protect an organization's reputation. Different crisis response strategies may have different effects on firm value. Moreover, a consumer's long-term memory system may influence information processing in response to food crises. Resonance theory (Wan, 2008) contends that people process information through an automatic cognitive procedure when they make an association between a stimulus and their longterm memory. People tend to make an association between a firm and an event more readily when the event occurs repeatedly. A firm that has been associated with food safety events in the past may elicit more negative responses because people more easily associate the firm with the negative event.

In studying the impact of media on stock price movements, there are two types of traders, noise traders who hold random beliefs about future value of firms and rational arbitrageurs who hold systematic (Bayesian) beliefs (Tetlock, 2007) . Information delivered by media may contain both noise and factual information. Investors make decisions based on their evaluation of the proportion of fact and noise. In order to investigate the impact of media reporting on stock returns, Tetlock (2007) examined the relationship between the new contents of the Wall Street Journal and daily stock returns, asserting that high media pessimism, such as negative or vague words, predicts temporary decreases in stock returns. Unlike studies focusing on financial crisis news (Swary, 1986; Ellis and Lewis, 2000) , the effect of other types of crisis-related information may display different patterns.

For example, food safety events associated with food manufacturers are more likely to be accompanied by a recall because they can eliminate the potential risk by removing problematic products; however, restaurant-associated food safety events are primarily caused by mistakes in the process of serving food to people.
