Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment [1].",

The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm [1,2]. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.

Certain viral infections can directly damage inner ear structures, others can induce inflammatory responses which then cause this damage, and still others can increase susceptibility or bacterial or fungal infection, leading to hearing loss. Typically, virus-induced hearing loss is sensorineural, although conductive and mixed hearing losses can be seen following infection with certain viruses. Occasionally, recovery of hearing after these infections can occur spontaneously [[3], [4], [5], [6]].",

Audiometric thresholds were measured using a calibrated Amplaid 309 clinical audiometer [9]. Air conduction thresholds were measured for frequencies from 250 to 8000 Hz using Telephonics TDH39 earphones. Bone conduction thresholds were obtained for frequencies from 250 to 4000 Hz using a Radio Ear B71 bone vibrator. The audiometric thresholds were measured using the modified Hughson-Westlake method [10].3-Immittance evaluation. Tympanometry was carried out using an Amplaid 775 middle ear analyzer to rule out middle ear pathology.4-Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) were recorded in all subjects using the Madsen Capella Analyzer. The eliciting stimuli consisted of a non-linear click delivered at about 80 dB peak SPL in the ear canal. The spectrum analyzer was triggered at 4 ms after presentation of the stimuli to avoid acoustic ringing of the input stimuli, and the temporal window was set at 20 ms. A total of 260 averages were recorded. TEOAEs were considered present when the reproducibility and stability was >80%. All testing was carried out in a double-walled, sound treated booth within permissible noise limits [11].\n",
