We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain.",

There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 : 0.00002 mol m -2 ), a low reduction in CO (<0.03 mol m -2 ), and a low-tomoderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1 -0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February-March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns. Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m -3 across a large part of the globe during April-July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread. Our findings suggest that there is ample scope for restoring the global environment from the ill-effects of anthropogenic activities through temporary shutdown measures.",

Rising global death tolls combined with the high infectivity of the virus, mild clinical symptoms, an uncertain incubation period, lack of pre-existing human immunity, and the possibility of asymptomatic healthy carriers (Bouey, 2020) led to the WHO declaring COVID-19 a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)\" on 30 th January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a) .

Aerosols have direct and indirect contributions on climate change at regional and global scales (Huang et al., 2014; Menon et al., 2002; Qian and Giorgi, 1999) as increased levels of aerosol optical depth (AOD) affects atmospheric stability and precipitation as aerosols disturb the scattering and absorption of solar radiation (Jiang et al., 2016) , the hydrological cycle (Prasad et al., 2004) and vegetation cover and its growth (Lal et al., 2019; Sarkar and Kafatos, 2004) . In addition to climatic effects, aerosols increase respiratory problems in humans and decrease visibility in urban areas (Prasad et al., 2005) . A study on the 2002/03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) showed a positive relationship between long term exposure to air pollution (PM 10 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , and SO 2 ) in China and a higher risk of dying (84%) in regions of moderate and high air pollution index (Cui et al.,",

Similarly, 90% of COVID-19 cases have been reported in countries with a temperature range of 3\u00b0 to 17\u00b0C and between an absolute humidity (AH) of 4 to 9 g m -3 (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020). Laboratory conditions conducive to the survival of the members of the coronavirus family are low temperatures (4\u00b0C), and moderate to high RH (20-80%) (Casanova et al., 2010) . However, the SARS-CoV-2 may survive for several days on plastics and metals at moderate temperatures (between 21-23\u00b0C) and a RH of 40% (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . This suggests there may be a direct relationship between temperature, humidity, environmental pollutants, and the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

In the present study, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on environmental pollution has been studied using spatio-temporal satellite-based products related to NO 2 , CO, and AOD. Major changes were observed in South Asia and South-East Asian countries including major parts of Indian regions like the IGP, where NO 2 concentration was drastically reduced during the 12 th to 16 th week as compared to previous weeks due to the shutdown of various industries and a travel ban issued on 24 th March 2020. In Western Africa, major changes were observed from 7 th and 8 th week and had been continuously decreasing, whereas major changes in Europe were observed 12 th week onwards. Besides, the variation in global NO 2 concentration is influenced by global wind circulations (Arya, 1999; Grundstrom et al., 2015; Santurt\u00fan et al., 2017) . A sharp reduction in NO 2 concentration occurred across the globe, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f primarily in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions during January to March 2020. As compared to 2019, other highly populated regions of the world (Europe, North America, and IGP) had also observed low (<0.00003 mol m -2 ) to moderate (<0.00005 mol m -2 ) reductions in NO 2 during 2020. These trends may be attributed to regional variations in the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the implementation of preventive measures. The incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels leads to the generation of CO which is spread by wind circulation patterns throughout the lower atmosphere (Novelli et al., 1998) . The weekly monitoring of global CO column number density based on daily observation of showing an increase with reference to the previous weeks, which may be attributed by the coverage of desert or proximity to the sea.",

AH plays a significant role in the transmission of SARS- CoV-2 (Carleton and Meng, 2020; Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Oliveiros et al., 2020) . A peak rate of spread of COVID-19 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere having a mean temperature of ~5\u00b0C, and AH of 4 to 9 g m -3 during the outbreak period was observed, while it was lower both in warmer/wetter and colder/drier regions (Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020). Nevertheless, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f changes in weather alone (i.e., increases or decreases of temperature and humidity) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions (Luo et al., 2020) . Therefore, a prospective global COVID-19 hazard based on AH from April to November 2020 was mapped and analysed (figure 8). The study projected an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard in a large part of the globe during April to July 2020 due to high prospective meteorological suitability (AH: 4 to 9 g m -3 ). The study illustrated a severe and high probability of COVID outbreak in major parts of the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere during May-July 2020 barring primarily tropical regions. Thereafter, a reduction in COVID-19 hazard may be evident in the tropical and subtropical regions during August-September 2020 due to variations in regional meteorological conditions. Later, in October-November 2020, COVID-19 hazard will be resurgent in the tropical and subtropical regions (primarily in the Northern Hemisphere) and reduced in temperate and sub-temperate regions of the globe. In the Asian continent, virus transmission has a low possibility except in China as the majority of countries will have moderate AH (2 to 4 g m -3 and >10 g m -3 ) until September 2020 ( Figure   8 ). The study indicated severe COVID-19 pandemic hazard in the coming months due to meteorological suitability apart from local transmissions. Thus, there are uncertainties associated with our model predictions. Hence, we advise the end users to practise caution while using the predictions.",

Major outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred in the region between 30\u00b0N and 50\u00b0N latitudes, with AH: 4 to 14 g m -3 .Virus transmission was much lower in regions of high humidity (>13 g m -3 ) as well as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f moderate temperature (around 17\u00b0C) (figure 4). It may be one major reason for the lower number of cases in the tropics. Similarly, cases are very low in regions located in the extreme Northern and the Southern Hemisphere due to low temperatures (<2\u00b0C) as well as low absolute humidity (<2 g m -3 ).SARS-Cov may not have had the ability to survive in higher temperature due to lipid layer breakdown (Chan et al., 2020) and SARS-CoV-2 may have similar behavior (El Zowalaty and J\u00e4rhult, 2020). While AH started increasing in major parts of Europe after 8 th week and 9 th week, the value stayed under 10 g m -3 , which is within the reported favourable range of coronavirus transmission (4 to 9 g m -3 ) (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020). The Indian subcontinent had an AH range of 12 to 18 g m -3 in recent weeks but, during 1 st week to 8 th week, the majority of regions had some extent of favourable AH range for virus transmission (i.e., 8 to 12 g m -3 ). Despite this, the number of reported cases was lower than expected, possibly due to early preventive measures and complete lockdown in most tropical countries.While in the upper part of the Northern Hemisphere with a temperature less than 0\u00b0C recorded very few cases, increasing COVID-19 cases during mid-March in regions of moderately high mean monthly temperatures (~20\u00b0C) may be attributed to coronavirus transmission by international travellers. Although detection of the number of cases varies due to multiple factors such as the number of tests, global connectivity, medical facilities, time, and the extent of implementation of government policies, several South Asian and African countries have announced lockdowns after the 2nd week of March as a preventive measure to curb the virus spread at stages 1 and 2.",
