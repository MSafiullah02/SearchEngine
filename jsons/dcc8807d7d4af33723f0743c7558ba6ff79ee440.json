A simple, pan-viral test to rule in a viral cause for respiratory symptoms could have a tremendous positive impact by facilitating rapid diagnosis, improving patient care, and enabling more efficient use of medical resources for the millions of patients with respiratory illness [3, 4] .",

Testing for a panel of suspected viruses can be time consuming and/or expensive, and falsely negative if the patient is infected with a virus that is not in the panel. Identifying which one of many clinically similar viruses is causing a respiratory illness usually does not impact treatment, because virus-specific therapies are only available for influenza.

Prevalence of individual viruses differed significantly from Study 1, with respiratory syncytial virus most prevalent in Study 2 and RV most prevalent in Study 1 (Figures 2C and 4C) . These findings reveal that CXCL10 or CXCL11 concentration can predict infection with diverse viruses. Figure 5 shows the CXCL11 protein concentration in 219 samples (Study 1 plus Study 2), sorted from highest to lowest concentration, with bars in the virus column indicating virus detections. As shown, high CXCL11 levels correlated strongly with virus detection and low levels correlated with absence of virus, with intermediate levels being indeterminate. Based on this pattern, it is possible to envision developing a rule-in/ruleout test using a high cutoff above which samples are predicted to be virus positive, and below which samples are predicted to be virus negative. Dashed grey lines in Figure 5 represent cutoffs of >80 pg/mL for rule-in, which in this sample set would have a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90% or a cutoff of >50 pg/mL, with a PPV of 86%; dotted black lines indicate a low cutoff of 10 pg/mL, below which this test has a negative predictive value of 94% for absence of virus infection. Using cutoffs of >80 pg/mL and <10 pg/mL, about 1/3 of the samples (35%) fall into the indeterminate zone. Consistent with the observations from each study (Figures 3 and 4A) , we observed a high degree of correlation between CXCL10 and CXCL11 protein concentrations (Supplementary Figure S5 CXCL11 or CXCL10 measurements could be used to rule in/ rule out virus infection.

We chose possible biomarkers based on transcripts strongly induced by a virus-like stimulus in primary nasal epithelial cells in vitro. The 3 mRNAs we selected all showed predictive value for viral infection in NP swabs. Surprisingly, we were also able to identify high-performing biomarkers detectable at the protein level by testing chemokines indicated by the in vitro experiment. The mRNA and protein biomarkers we identified are all molecules known to be associated with the antiviral interferon response, a key host defense response to both RNA and DNA viruses in which viral recognition leads to interferon secretion and induction of approximately 300 different antiviral effectors [30] . While this result is not unexpected, interferon-stimulated genes have diverse regulatory mechanisms, are differentially expressed in different host tissues, and are differentially antagonized by different viruses. Therefore, identifying which one(s) performed best as pan-viral infection biomarkers in the upper respiratory tract required empirical testing.",

This test compares favorably with a recently reported mRNA-based index correlating Viperin mRNA levels to viral infection [13] . Technologies to support practical tests based on measuring host transcripts are under active development [32] . Importantly, our findings showed that NP swab-associated CXCL10 or CXCL11 protein concentrations can also serve as biomarkers of viral infection.

Recent studies show that while host antiviral responses can be detected in the respiratory tract of asymptomatic virus-infected subjects, the magnitude of transcriptional response (and possibly the presence of a response at the protein level) is greater in symptomatic than asymptomatic subjects [13, [33] [34] [35] . Consistently, analysis of rhinovirus-positive samples in Study 2 showed a clear correlation between low [CXCL11] and low viral load (Supplementary Figure S4) . Biomarker-positive, virus-negative samples could represent infections with untested viruses. Applying technologies such as deep sequencing for viral identification could provide greater estimates of biomarker accuracy in future studies [36] . It will also be important to rule out nonviral biological processes leading to biomarker elevation. For example, elevated CXCR3 chemokines have been reported in chronic respiratory diseases [37] . Encouragingly, our initial results indicate specificity of the biomarker test for virus infection in this population. In Study 1, 16/68 (23.5%) of patients had COPD or asthma and 11 of these patients were virus negative; these patients also tested virus negative by the host mRNA biomarker signature (Figure 2) .",

In this patient population, biomarker-based testing could provide a simple, cost-effective method to rule in/rule out of viral infection as the cause of symptoms and/or determine which patients require additional virology testing. If these biomarkers perform well in outpatients with acute upper respiratory infection, it is possible to imagine transformative new tests to aid in rapid diagnosis of these common illnesses and promote antimicrobial stewardship. For example, a pan-viral biomarker could potentially be paired with an analogous biomarker of bacterial respiratory infection to distinguish among viral infection, bacterial infection, and viral/bacterial coinfection. In Study 1, we observed that nonviral infections did not trigger the virus host response signature (Supplementary Table S2 ) indicating the potential feasibility of this approach.",
