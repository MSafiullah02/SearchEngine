Geographically and politically China and Pakistan are closely connected as shown in Figure 3. A large number of Chinese people are working in Pakistan on different developmental projects (China Pakistan Economic Corridor, Dams, Gawdar Port), and on the other hand many Pakistanis are residing in China carrying out their studies, business and jobs. The outbreak of coronavirus has appeared during the peak travel time when the Chinese from Pakistan and around the world are traveling to China, while the Pakistani community, especially students, are traveling back to Pakistan due to winter break. One of such case has been reported on 24 January 2020 after a person traveled from China to Pakistan on 21 January 2020 via Dubai and was diagnosed for 2019-nCoV on 24 January.3 However, the case was not notified officially by the government of Pakistan. In the depicted situation, the future is very alarming. After the ending of Chinese New Year celebrations, the Chinese will travel back to their jobs abroad, which may result in an outbreak of the fatal virus infection in Pakistan and other countries.",
