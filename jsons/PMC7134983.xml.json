            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a newly described infection affecting, in most individuals, the lungs with progressive severe pneumonia. It is highly contagious and has a high mortality rate. It is unresponsive to antibiotics and the main methods of control involve barrier isolation. Because of these features, early diagnosis is required for control of the disease. Unlike other forms of severe pneumonia, the initial presenting chest radiograph may not disclose the pneumonia. Recent reports from three sites indicate that of 218 affected individuals, the chest radiograph was positive for pneumonia on the initial chest radiograph in 164 (75%) (range 60\u201380%) and without evidence of pneumonia in 54 (25%) (range 20\u201340%) [1], [2], [3]. This is distinct from other forms of severe pneumonia; for example, with Legionella pneumonia, only 1% of initial chest radiographs are reported to be without evidence of pneumonia [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",

The preliminary study presented demonstrates the potential of a computer-aided diagnosis system to detect minimal areas of pneumonia.
