Phosphocreatine acts as a phosphate donor for the formation of ATP, which is needed for muscle contraction. At rest CK contributes to restoration of phosphocreatine concentration using ATP in excess of that needed by muscle. In people, tissues with the highest CK activity include skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, followed by neural tissue, although its activity per gram of neural tissue is low owing to the large amount of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Low CK activity can be detected in other tissues, such as gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, kidney, and thyroid. 1 CK is primarily cytoplasmic and leakage from injured or inflamed tissues leads to increased CK activity in blood, permitting assay of plasma or serum CK activity as a biomarker of tissue damage. CK is a dimer composed of B monomers, M monomers, or both, with a moderate degree of structural homology between the 2 subunits and between different species. 2 Combinations of these monomers generate isoenzymes CK-BB, CK-MB, and CK-MM, which can be found predominantly in brain, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle, respectively. 3 CK-BB, CK-MB, and CK-MM are also called CK1, CK2, and CK3, respectively, according to their electrophoretic migration. In addition to the 3 dimeric CK isoenzymes, there is a structurally different mitochondrial isoform, CK-MT or CKm, detectable in tissues, and 2 macroenzymes, macro-CK1 and macro-CK2, detectable in blood. Macro-CK1 is dimeric CK-BB bound to immunoglobulins macro-CK2 consists of oligomers of CK-MT. 3 Total CK activity can be measured in plasma or serum using an enzymatic method that utilizes CK-Nacetylcysteine (CK-NAC). 4 Although this method does not identify specific isoenzymes or isoforms, it provides an estimate of CK-MM activity, which is responsible for the majority of plasma CK activity in many species. CK-MB can be measured by immunoenzymatic methods designed for diagnostic purposes in people with myocardial diseases; these methods have also been used in dogs, although definitive validation studies have not been done. [5] [6] [7] By contrast, CK-BB and macroenzymes can be measured only by more expensive and labor-intensive methods, such as chromatography, immunoprecipitation, immunoinhibition, differential enzyme activation, and electrophoresis. 3 The limited information about CK isoenzymes in dogs is focused on CK-MM and CK-MB. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Only one study reported serum CK-BB activity in dogs with neurologic disease. 12 To our knowledge there are no studies of canine and feline macro-CK1 and macro-CK2, which have been associated with immune-mediated and neoplastic conditions, respectively, in people, 14 or of electrophoretic fractions of CK in feline serum.

The low activity of CK in canine serum required a modification of the manufacturer's protocol and a doubling of the amount of serum applied to achieve visible bands. The creation of a specific ''canine ISO-CK'' program with a longer application time, increasing the amount of serum transferred to the gel, is advisable in the future. This low CK activity may have been a storage artifact as a previous study 17 and preliminary experiments in our laboratory (data not shown) demonstrated that freezing and thawing decreases CK activity. This decrease, however, accounts for o 10% of native CK activity. Low total CK activity in our canine group was similar to that reported in previous studies, 8, 11 and discrepancies between the serum CK activities in healthy animals, especially cats, in this study and other studies 18, 19 may result from differences in analytical methods rather than storage artifacts. Similarly, analysis of interassay imprecision for isoenzyme fractions in pooled serum samples did not reveal a common trend (neither an increase nor a decrease of percentages) associated with prior storage at \u00c0 201C. It should be emphasized that a complete validation study, which would have provided more detailed information about possible storage artifacts on isoenzyme electrophoresis, was not performed. Specifically, the number of replicates in our preliminary testing was less than is recommended to assess both intra-and interassay imprecision, and stability should be assessed using a different approach. 20 Despite these limitations, CVs indicated acceptable repeatability and reproducibility of isoenzyme determinations, comparable with those reported by the kit manufacturer for CK-BB, CK-MB, and CK-MM in human serum, 21 independent of storage conditions. A more detailed evaluation of storage-related artifacts, however, is recommended before suggesting clinical application of automated CK gel electrophoresis.
