Xiamen, which is located adjacent to the Taiwan Strait, is a well-known tourist port city on the southeast coast of China (Supplementary Fig. 1). A gradually increasing number of international travellers are entering Xiamen, leading to a higher risk of exposure to imported infectious diseases in the area. Experience gained during the severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemics has highlighted the importance of border screening to the understanding of cross-border transmission of infectious diseases [2]. Border screening is therefore an important tool for monitoring infectious diseases carried by incoming travellers at Xiamen International Airport and understanding their effect on the local circulation of infectious diseases.",

This project exposed several problems in the border screening system: (a) screening measures such as visual inspection and thermal scanning have low sensitivity and are ineffective in detecting infected persons; (b) the sensitivity of most currently available rapid antigen tests, which are largely based on the colloidal gold system, is too low to effectively detect infection; and (c) the RT-PCR assay is not suitable for border screening as a result of its high cost and lengthy, labour-intensive protocols. New rapid antigen tests with high sensitivity are the most desirable option for disease surveillance in the border screening setting.",

Continuous screening for influenza was conducted from May 2015 to May 2016 to determine the incidence of imported influenza viruses carried by incoming travellers with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms at the Xiamen airport entry border. Every traveller was screened by infrared thermometer, and travellers with body temperature \u226537.5\u00b0C or with the obvious presence of specific symptoms, including cough, rhinorrhoea, sore throat and/or gastrointestinal disturbance, were considered to be likely ILI cases and the patients invited to participate in a consultation to obtain informed consent, basic personal information and a medical history. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from travellers with ILIs and tested at the airport using a rapid influenza antigen test. Each swab sample was soaked in virus transport medium (total volume of 1.5 mL) and transported to the laboratory within 48 hours of collection for virus isolation through culture in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Travellers did not receive any kind of medical certificate, diagnosis or therapeutic intervention in this study. This study was approved by the medical ethics committee at Xiamen University, China.",

The results indicated that 83.6% (61/73) of the influenza A isolates were H3N2 virus in 2015, whereas 72.4% (42/58) of the influenza A isolates were A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2016, thus suggesting that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 entered a new endemic phase in 2016, replacing H3N2. Some of the other influenza A viruses were neither H1 or H3 and are designated as untyped. For the influenza B viruses, more Victoria-like virus strains were isolated than Yamagata-like virus strains in this study. Notably, Yamagata-like viruses were seldom isolated in 2015 but became much more common after February 2016.

The epidemiologic study of influenza viruses imported during nonpandemic periods may provide useful information distinct from that obtained through border screening conducted during pandemic periods. This study has some limitations: the probability that some asymptomatic travellers missed detection; the sensitivity of the reference standard, virus culture, is less than 100%, which may have biased the assessment; and the lack of any follow-up of the influenza cases identified.",

This study showed that the Flu Dot-ELISA has comparatively high sensitivity in border screening for influenza infection (96.6, 95% CI 92.7\u201398.7). The higher sensitivity of the assay may be attributed to two aspects: first, the enzyme-induced signal amplification system used confers sensitivity at least ten times higher than that of traditional rapid assays based on the colloidal gold system [16]; and second, the nasopharyngeal specimens we tested were one of the most appropriate sample types for virus detection using rapid tests [17], [18]. Nevertheless, six of the 176 positive influenza isolates were missed by the rapid test; further improvements in sensitivity would be desirable. The specificity of the Flu Dot-ELISA (91.3, 95% CI 89.4\u201393.0) is acceptable but somewhat lower than the 100% specificity shown in a previous report [15], possibly because of the application strategy we used in our study. To identify as many influenza viruses in incoming travellers with ILIs as possible, we chose to regard even those samples with very weak colour development in the Flu Dot-ELISA as positive, thus leading to a false-positive rate of 8.7% (91/1048).",

This observation may reflect the circulation trend in the countries from which travellers departed. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that H3N2 virus strains isolated in 2015 were phylogenetically diverse and comparatively distantly related to the H3N2 vaccine strain A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014, confirming a recently reported similar finding [19]. However, the H3N2 virus strains isolated in both 2015 and 2016 were more closely related to the new H3N2 vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, which was recommended by the WHO in 2015 [20]. These findings strongly suggest that changing the H3N2 vaccine strain for the 2015\u20132016 influenza season must have contributed to better control of the H3N2 endemic in 2016. In addition, the increasing frequency and phylogenetic differentiation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated in 2016 indicates that changing the current vaccine strain A/California/04/2009 should be considered to address this increased antigenic drift and prevent a vaccine mismatch. A similar phenomenon was observed in the surveillance of influenza B viruses. The markedly increased proportion of both influenza B lineages in 2016 indicates that cocirculation of both lineages (Yamagata and Victoria) is occurring. Notably, the more pronounced antigenic drift and mismatch with the Victoria lineage vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008, shown here and indicated in a recent report [21], suggests that not only should the application of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, which includes both influenza B lineages, be considered but also that the vaccine strain for the Victoria lineage should be changed.",
