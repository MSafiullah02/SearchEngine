Based on the genetic characteristics of the attachment protein (G protein) and monoclonal antibody reactions, RSVs are subdivided into two genotypes: genotype A (RSV\u2010A) and genotype B (RSV\u2010B) [Mufson et al., 1985]. To date, 14 RSV\u2010A subtypes (GA1\u20137, SAA1\u20132, NA1\u20134, and ON1 [Peret et al., 2000, 1998; Venter et al., 2001; Shobugawa et al., 2009; Eshaghi et al., 2012; Pretorius et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2014]) and 22 RSV\u2010B subtypes (GB1\u20135, SAB1\u20134, URU1\u20132, BA1\u201310, and THB [Peret et al., 2000, 1998; Venter et al., 2002; Dapat et al., 2010; Trento et al., 2010; Auksornkitti et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2015]) have been described. The newly identified ON1 subtype of RSV\u2010A, which was first reported in Canada in 2010 [Eshaghi et al., 2012], contains a unique 72\u2010nucleotide duplication in the second hyper\u2010variable region of the G gene and may be spreading rapidly, perhaps replacing NA1, another prevalent RSV\u2010A subtype, in countries such as China, South Korea, Germany, and Italy [Kim et al., 2014; Pierangeli et al., 2014; Tabatabai et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2015]. A similar duplication phenomenon in the variable region of the G protein was also observed in the BA subtype of RSV\u2010B in 1999 in Buenos Aries, Argentina [Trento et al., 2003]; this strain spread rapidly to additional countries, resulting in the current prevalence of RSV\u2010B infections [Dapat et al., 2010; Trento et al., 2010].",

There were six unique amino acid substitutions for NA1: N251Y, P310L, P313S, S314P, P316S, and P317S. In the A2 prototype strain, there are three potential N\u2010glycosylation sites (NXT, where X is not a proline) in the second variable region of the G protein. However, all of the ON1 isolates and most of the NA1 isolates had lost the N\u2010glycosylation site at amino acid 251and 249 due to T251K and N249Y substitutions, respectively (Fig. 2). Compared to the GB1, All BA9 strains had T207P, A215D, P219L, T223P, T229I, L237P, E238K, S247P, L257S, V270A, and L287Y substitutions (Fig. 3).",

In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and patterns of co\u2010circulating genotypes of both RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B subtypes in Chenzhou, South China, in 2014. Of the 64 RSV positive cases, 24 were RSV\u2010A and 40 were RSV\u2010B, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the majority of the RSV\u2010B strains clustered with BA9 and that the RSV\u2010A strains clustered with strains of the new genotype, ON1 and its ancestor, NA1. In line with other studies in China and elsewhere, this study reports BA (BA9) as the predominant genotype [Zhang et al., 2010b; Rebuffo\u2010Scheer et al., 2011; Yamaguchi et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2015], suggesting that this subgroup has undergone adaptation and rapid spreading. Interestingly, the predominant subtype in Chenzhou from 2013 to 2014 was different from that in Beijing, which may be due to the differing climates between the two regions.",

A similar duplication phenomenon in the variable region of the G\u2010protein was also observed in the 1999BA genotype of RSV\u2010B [Trento et al., 2010]. Over the last 15 years, the BA subtype became the globally dominant RSV\u2010B strain [Dapat et al., 2010; Trento et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b; Rebuffo\u2010Scheer et al., 2011; Yamaguchi et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2015]. Now, ON1 has thus far been detected in many countries, including Canada [Eshaghi et al., 2012], Italy [Pierangeli et al., 2014], Germany [Tabatabai et al., 2014], China [Cui et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2014], Japan [Hirano et al., 2014], Malaysia [Khor et al., 2013], India [Choudhary et al., 2013], South Korea [Lee et al., 2012], Thailand [Auksornkitti et al., 2014], Kenya [Agoti et al., 2014], and South Africa [Valley\u2010Omar et al., 2013]. These studies suggest that the ON1 subtype was transmitted globally and rapidly. Supporting this notion, many countries have reported that ON1 has become the predominant subtype [Lee et al., 2012; Agoti et al., 2014; Pierangeli et al., 2014; Tabatabai et al., 2014]. Thus, whether the ON1 subtype will follow the pattern of the BA subtype and become the predominant strain of RSV\u2010A worldwide is a question of great interest.",

According to the circulating pattern of the RSV subtypes in Chongqing, the NA1 genotype has been the predominant RSV\u2010A strain for the past 8 years, and the ON1 genotype will be the predominant RSV\u2010A subtype in 2014\u20132015 (Table III) [Ren et al., 2014]. Our results, which are in line with this circulation pattern, indicate that the ON1 genotype was the predominant RSV\u2010A subtype in 2014, suggesting that a rapid spread of this emerging RSV strain had occurred. Thus, the ON1 genotype may become the predominant strain of RSV in China, but further study will be needed to confirm this possibility.",

Presentation of clinical symptoms did not differ between patients with RSV\u2010A versus RSV\u2010B infections. Our age\u2010group analysis revealed that infants under 1 year of age accounted for 75.6% of the detected RSV infections and infants less than 6 months old accounted for \u223c53%. Interestingly, the age distribution of patients with subtype ON1 infections was more uniform across age groups, whereas the NA1 and BA9 subtypes were found mostly in infants less than 6 months old. Thus, we hypothesized that the ON1 genotype is a novel RSV genotype, and given that most children were infected with ON1 for the first time, we reasoned that the organism must have no specific protective immunity. Conversely, NA1 and BA9 mainly infected infants less than 6 months of age likely because infection provides protective immunity thereafter, although limited. Thus, the vast majority of RSV reinfections are with genetically distinct strains [Agoti et al., 2012]. Unfortunately, the sample size of this study was not large enough to confirm this reasoning.",
