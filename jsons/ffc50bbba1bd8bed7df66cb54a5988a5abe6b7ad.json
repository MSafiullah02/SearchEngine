In particular, CVD is associated with a sharp increase in overall mortality, which reaches almost 20% of those hospitalized(5). However, while such an association can be somewhat anticipated (based on existing data from previous outbreaks of influenza and SARS), the incidence of myocardial injury for COVID-19 infection appears to be higher (6) . Furthermore, the definition of COVID-19 associated \"myocardial injury\" lacks standardization, and is based primarily on elevated (and highly variable) serum levels of cardiac-specific troponins as the single most common defining marker. This myocardial injury has been associated with evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and arrhythmia (2, 5, 7, 8) .",

This includes normal results for serial measurements of cTnI and repeated TTE studies, and no arrhythmia other than sinus tachycardia. Accepting electrocardiographic ST segment elevation as representative of \"myocardial injury\" may be conceptually tempting for the diagnosis of cardiac involvement related to COVID-19 infection. However, the cautious practitioner will remember the poor specificity of ST segment elevation, which is encountered in a variety of conditions that mimic acute myocardial infarction. To further complicate the matter, serum cTnI can also be elevated in a variety of non-cardiac conditions, including sepsis and critical illness.",

We did not interpret the isolated elevation of low specificity CK-MB as evidence for a diagnosis of myocarditis in the context of severe illness, sepsis, and acidosis, with normal myoglobin. Right ventricular supply-demand mismatch was also ruled out by normal serial cTnI serum values. We felt that the hypothesis of non-ischemic EKG changes was further supported by the absence of gross coronary calcifications on the chest CT, a finding associated with very high negative predictive value for coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, we attributed the EKG changes to acute, severe right ventricular strain in the setting of COVID-19 related ARDS, a phenomenon described by anecdotal reports of pulmonary embolism.",

In one of these cases, the diagnosis of myocarditis was complemented by the presence of myocardial edema by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, as a marker of acute myocardial injury (9) . Our patient, while critically ill and mechanically ventilated, maintained hemodynamic stability, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and had no evidence for cardiac arrhythmias. As such, we felt comfortable recommending medical management, and chose not to pursue an invasive coronary angiography or any additional imaging tests, including a cCTA.
