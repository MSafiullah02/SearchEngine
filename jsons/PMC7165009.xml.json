Patients can present with varying degrees of symptoms and according to one report, 86 % of all infections were undocumented prior to January 23, 2020\n2\n. Therefore, risk of infection reported in healthcare workers is substantial\n3\n. In particular, while performing gastrointestinal endoscopy, there is risk of exposure to the endoscopists as well as the endoscopy team, including nurses, endoscopy technicians and anesthesia staff\n4\n. While upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, there are now data to suggest that the risk may not limited to upper endoscopy alone, as recent reports have detected SARS-CoV in stool samples\n5\n. This has led to recommendations that all elective and non-urgent endoscopic procedures be cancelled or postponed at this time\n4\n6\n.\n",

In some clinical scenarios, the decision to perform or delay a procedure is evident. For example, there is clear consensus that procedures for indications such as suspected variceal bleeding, non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute cholangitis, foreign body removal, and cancer-related care (i. e. tissue acquisition for diagnosis, loco-regional staging, and palliative procedures) are urgent and should continue to be performed\n7\n8\n9\n. Similarly, endoscopic evaluations of chronic symptoms such as diarrhea and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk individuals, are considered non-urgent and should be deferred. Between these definitions exists a large array of potentially time-sensitive but not technically urgent or emergent endoscopic interventions. These grey areas or \u201csemi-urgent\u201d indications pose a clinical dilemma for the gastroenterologist with regard to proceeding with or deferring the procedure during this unprecedented time.\n",

Scenario 5 discussed patients presenting with hematochezia, and the majority (62 %) thought only patients with hemodynamic instability should get inpatient colonoscopy. In patients with cirrhosis who had symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (scenario 6), 87.6 % thought that they should get urgent upper endoscopy.

Scenario 13 discussed planned endoscopic removal or exchange of plastic biliary stents previously placed for scenarios currently resolved or for which the patient was currently asymptomatic. 45.6 % thought this was semi-urgent and can be deferred (\nFig. 1\n).

The respondents are from all over the world and there may be practice variation in different regions of the world. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is in different phases throughout the world and as the crisis worsens, the definition of semi-urgent endoscopy may narrow. It\u2019s plausible that respondents from hard-hit Western European countries such as Spain and Italy have a stricter definition of what warrants endoscopic evaluation during this pandemic. This cross-sectional analysis captures the opinion of the respondents at a specific time in the pandemic, the severity of which varies by locality. As the crisis worsens, a longitudinal study may well show that these opinions on what constitutes \u201csemi-urgent\u201d endoscopy narrow over time as disease prevalence increases. The variability of responses could also be driven by the fact that currently there is no defined duration for this pandemic and some gastroenterologists might be concerned about the uncertainty of how long a deferred patient would have to wait until their procedure is finally performed. This becomes especially important in patients with premalignant conditions. The Joint GI Society Message on COVID-19 does state that some non-urgent procedures are higher priority and examples included prosthesis (e. g. stent) removal and evaluation of significant symptoms\n11\n. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases are exponentially rising in many regions, another major concern for performing any endoscopy is the amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) that is needed to perform a single procedure safely. PPE is an important resource at this time which needs to be judiciously used. Hence, many gastroenterologists are opting to defer many of the procedures above, even though in the \u201cnon-pandemic\u201d situation these are likely to be performed sooner.\n",

Our estimated response rate is low, however, previously reported response rates are applicable to traditional methods like email and regular mail, and may not apply to social media platforms like Twitter. This highlights the need to develop new standards of data acquisition/surveys as social media platforms are going to be increasingly and effectively used for this purpose in the future.\u200b Also, we cannot tell how many of the people who cast votes were from which countries and what level in their career (gastroenterologists, gastroenterology fellows, internal medicine physicians). Expanding on this, there were poll questions regarding procedures such as ERCP and ESD, which a minority of the respondents actually perform in clinical practice. It is unclear whether answers would vary if only physicians credentialed in these techniques were allowed to respond. As previously mentioned, this crisis is in different phases throughout the world. At the time of this manuscript, Spain and Italy continue to have dire situations regarding PPE availability, and inpatient volume has exceeded the critical care threshold capacity in many of these centers. We were not able to stratify responses by geographical region to assess for variability, which would have certainly provided important information. In addition, releasing a poll on Twitter will only capture physicians who are currently engaged in using this particular social media platform, and the popularity of Twitter use varies among different countries. However, we did find significant engagement from across the world (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia), and participation from gastroenterologists from both the academic and community setting.",

It also highlights that there is currently a lack of consensus regarding how to prioritize certain potentially time-sensitive endoscopic procedures. Although each patient is unique and many clinical decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis, our analysis will provide some perspective and guidance to gastroenterologists while dealing with these clinical scenarios. Our findings also strongly support the need for developing societal guidance in these \u201csemi-urgent\u201d scenarios to assist during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and we are aware of numerous gastroenterology societies that are engaged presently in this endeavor. Finally, this study shows how social media platforms can be positively used to gain instantaneous and clinically useful information from around the globe in response to rapidly changing situations.",
