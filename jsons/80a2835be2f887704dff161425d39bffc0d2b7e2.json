Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, before adding 20 ml DMEM additionally supplemented with 2.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and 15 mM HEPES. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator and supernatant harvested at day 3 post inoculation when a strong CPE was visible. Supernatants were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 \u00d7 g to remove cellular debris, and then aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C as virus stocks. Infectious virus titer was determined as plaque forming units (PFU) or tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) and RNA copies were determined by RT-qPCR for CoV-N.",

The day 12 and 13 samples were directly frozen at -20\u00b0C. Samples of day 14 (M1/M2) as well the day 25 sample were analyzed the same day they were taken without previous storage at -20\u00b0C. The remaining milk was frozen in aliquots. All samples were defrosted simultaneously, blinded, and analyzed as described below in two independent experiments (separate preparation of samples, separate RNA isolation). To avoid cross-contamination, only one tube was opened at a time. Skim milk was prepared by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 \u00d7 g and the lower aqueous phase was used for further experiments and analysis.",

Briefly, 280 \u03bcl sample were mixed with 1120 \u00b5l lysis buffer (AVL) and incubated 20 min at room temperature to ensure lysis and inactivation of virions. Samples were then frozen at -20\u00b0C to allow processing at a later time point. Prior to RT-qPCR, samples were thawed and 5.6 \u03bcg carrier RNA added to each sample, followed by vortexing and an additional 10 min incubation at room temperature. 1120 \u03bcl ethanol was then added, samples vortexed and briefly centrifuged to remove droplets from the lid and the entire volume then stepwise loaded onto columns. All subsequent steps were performed as instructed by the manufacturer. Viral RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcl AVE buffer, corresponding to 4.67-fold concentration from the 280 \u03bcl source fluid used for isolation. RNA was stored at -80\u00b0C.",

Synthetic SARS-CoV-2-RNA (Twist Bioscience, #102024) was used as a quantitative standard to obtain viral copy numbers. To avoid contamination of samples, RT-qPCR reaction mix was first added to all wells followed by RNA samples and these wells were then covered with sealing foil. RNA standard was titrated in a separate laminar flow cabinet and added to wells last. RT-qPCR reactions were performed using TaqMan\u00ae Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, #4444436) and a OneStepPlus Real-Time PCR System (96-well format, fast mode).
