            "text": "Genetic change was a prerequisite for the early life forms to be generated and maintained (Chapter 1), and it is also a requirement for the evolution of present-day life. We may willingly or inadvertently modify selective pressures, but genetic change is rooted in all replication machineries. Viruses use the same molecular mechanisms of genetic variation than any other form of life: mutation, hypermutation, several types of recombination, and genome segment reassortment. Mutation is observed in all viruses, with no known exceptions. Recombination is also widespread, but its role in the generation of diversity appears to vary among viruses. Its occurrence was soon accepted for DNA viruses, but it was considered uncertain for the RNA viruses. Pioneer studies by P. D. Cooper and colleagues with poliovirus (PV) and by A.M. King and colleagues with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) provided the first evidence of recombination in RNA. The present perception is that recombination is more widespread than thought only a few decades ago, but that its frequency and the types of genomic forms it generates vary among viruses. For example, as a general rule, it appears that positive strand RNA viruses recombine more easily than negative strand RNA viruses to give rise to mosaic genomes of standard length. Several negative strand RNA viruses, however, can yield defective genomes through recombination, frequently characterized by deletions in their RNA. Genome segment reassortment, the variation event in viruses closest to chromosomal exchanges in sexual reproduction, is obviously privative of segmented viral genomes. The three modes of virus genome variation are not incompatible, and reassortant-recombinant-mutant genomes have been described. The potential for genetic variation of RNA and DNA viral genomes is remarkable, and it is the ultimate molecular mechanism that lies at the origin of the virus diversity delineated in Chapter 1.",

In the case of viral genomes, mutations can result from different mechanisms: (i) template miscopying (direct incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide); (ii) primer-template misalignments that include miscoding followed by realignment, and misalignment of the template relative to the growing chain (polymerase \u201cslippage\u201d or \u201cstuttering\u201d); (iii) activity of cellular enzymes (i.e., deaminases), or (iv) chemical damage to the viral nucleic acids (deamination, depurination, depyrimidination, reactions with oxygen radicals, direct and indirect effects of ionizing radiation, photochemical reactions, etc.) (Naegeli, 1997, Bloomfield et al., 2000, Friedberg et al., 2006).",

Each base in DNA (adenine, A; guanine, G; cytosine, C; thymine, T) and RNA (with uracil, U instead of T) includes potential hydrogen-bonding donor sites (amino or amino protons) and hydrogen-bonding acceptor sites (carbonyl oxygens or aromatic nitrogens) that contribute to standard Watson-Crick base pairs (Figure 2.1\n) as well as wobble base pairs (nonstandard Watson-Crick, but fundamental for RNA secondary structure and mRNA translation) (Figure 2.2\n). The conformation of the purine and pyrimidine bases is highly dynamic. Amino and methyl groups rotate about the bonds that link them to the ring structure. In dilute solution hydrogen bonds are established with water, and they can be displaced by nucleotide or amino acid residues to give rise to nucleotide-nucleotide or nucleotide-amino acid interactions. The strength difference between hydrogen bonds established in a polynucleotide chain with water, and their strength between two bases in separate polynucleotide chains determines whether a double-stranded polynucleotide will be stably formed.",

As a consequence, in addition to the standard Watson-Crick and wobble, other base pairs are found in naturally occurring nucleic acids (notably cellular rRNA and tRNA) and in synthetic oligonucleotides (A-U or A-T Hoogsteen, and A-G, C-U, G-G, and U-U pairs, as well as interactions involving ionized bases). One of the types of electronic redistribution leads to tautomeric changes, such as the keto-enol and amino-imino transitions, which modify the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base; tautomeric imino and enol forms of the standard bases can produce non-Watson-Crick pairs. The proportion of the alternative tautomeric forms can be influenced by modifications in the purine and pyrimidine rings, which in turn can favor either the syn or anti conformation of a nucleoside, which is defined by the torsion angle of the bond between the 1\u2032 carbon of the ribose and either N1 in pyrimidines or N9 in purines (Figure 2.1). The anti conformation is usually the more stable in standard nucleotides and polynucleotides. The transition from the anti to the syn conformation may alter the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base thereby inducing mutagenesis (Bloomfield et al., 2000, Suzuki et al., 2006). The understanding of conformational effects on the base-pairing tendencies of nucleoside analogs in the context of the active site of a polymerase is very relevant to the design of specific mutagenic analogs for viral polymerases (Chapter 9).",

In the case of RNA, double-stranded regions in the adequate alternacy with single-stranded regions, determine key catalytic or macromolecule-attracting activities, as for example, the ribozyme activities mentioned in Chapter 1, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of several viral and cellular mRNAs, or multitudes of functional RNA-protein interactions currently being unveiled.",

Structural transitions due to alternative stacking conformations, particularly within polypurine or polypyrimidine tracts, can affect nucleic acid-protein interactions. In turn, replication machineries (typically including viral and host proteins gathered in membrane structures) would also be expected to be affected by nucleic acid conformations; such effects are important in virology regarding consequences for mutant generation in a given template sequence context. These considerations on structural transitions are relevant to the nonneutral character of silent (also termed synonymous) mutations to be addressed in the next section. Transitions from a single-stranded into a double-stranded nucleic acid structure and the relative stability of the two forms depend on multiple factors that include the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid, its being a ribo- or a deoxyribo-polynucleotide, temperature and ionic composition, and ionic strength. Positively charged counterions neutralize negatively charged phosphates, and favor duplex stability [as an overview of physical and chemical properties of nucleic acids and their nucleotide components, see (Bloomfield et al., 2000)].",

The latter occur preferentially at homopolymeric tracts and also at short, repeated sequences which are prone to misalignment mutagenesis (Figure 2.4\n). An example is an editing mechanism for some viral mRNAs such as the phosphoprotein mRNA of the Paramyxovirinae [(Kolakofsky et al., 2005) and references therein]. Other examples in vivo are hot spots for variation in reiterated sequences in complex DNA genomes (Yamaguchi et al., 1998, Barrett and McFadden, 2008, McGeoch et al., 2008), or the insertion of two amino acids (often Ser-Ser, Ser-Gly, or Ser-Ala between residues 69 and 70 of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase), in concert with HIV-1 resistance to nucleoside inhibitors (Winters and Merigan, 2005) (Chapter 8). The molecular mechanisms involved in the generation of point mutations and indels are subject to thermodynamic and quantum-mechanical uncertainty inherent to atomic fluctuations, rendering mutagenesis a highly unpredictable event (Domingo et al., 1995, Eigen, 2013). This fact is relevant to virus evolution because it introduces an element of stochasticity (randomness) in a key motor of evolution: the generation of diversity at the molecular level.",

Silent or synonymous mutations are those that do not give rise to an amino acid substitution despite being located in an open reading frame (protein-coding region) of a genome. The absence of amino acid substitution is due to the degeneracy of the genetic code: the same amino acid can be coded for by two or more triplets (codons), with the exception of AUG for methionine and UGG for tryptophan. Synonymous mutations are not necessarily selectively neutral, neutral meaning that they have no discernible consequence for any viral function. The assumption that synonymous mutations are selectively neutral, and the fact that the early comparison of nucleotide sequences of homologous genes showed a dominance of synonymous over nonsynonymous mutations, contributed to the foundations of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. This theory attributed the evolution of organisms at the molecular level mainly to the random drift of genomes carrying neutral or quasi (or nearly) neutral mutations (King and Jukes, 1969, Kimura, 1983, Kimura, 1989). The terms quasi neutral or nearly neutral may seem ambiguous to molecular biologists. However, in the formulation of the neutral theory they had a precise meaning of the selection coefficient being lower than the inverse of the effective population size, with minor variations in the equations of some formulations (Kimura, 1983).",

            "text": "Despite random drift of genomes playing an important role in molecular evolution, evidence gathered over the last decades renders untenable the assumption that synonymous mutations are neutral. Evidence to the contrary has been obtained with viruses and cells, including mutations in the human genome (Novella, 2004, Novella et al., 2004, Parmley et al., 2006, Hamano et al., 2007, Resch et al., 2007, Lafforgue et al., 2011, Nevot et al., 2011). There are several mechanisms by which synonymous mutations can affect virus behavior. They may alter cis-acting regulatory elements in viral genomes, decrease the stability of duplex structures stabilized between viral sequences and miRNAs or siRNAs, and promote alterations of viral gene expression or escape from RNA interference (Lafforgue et al., 2011, Nevot et al., 2011). Silent mutation-dependent modification of secondary or higher order structures of genomic RNA or messenger RNAs may have several effects including splicing precision or translation fidelity through the modification of RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. Synonymous codons use different tRNAs for protein synthesis, and different tRNAs do not have the same relative abundance in different host cells. Thus, the rate of protein synthesis, an extremely important phenotypic trait for cells and viruses, can be affected by the frequency of alternative synonymous codons present in a mRNA (Richmond, 1970, Akashi, 2001). Not only does codon bias affect the level of gene expression, but rare codon distribution may regulate the folding of nascent proteins during translation (Makhoul and Trifonov, 2002, Rocha, 2004, Aragones et al., 2010). As a consequence, generation of rare codons by mutation of abundant codons (or vice versa) can modify viral replicative capacity (or fitness, Chapter 5). Rare codons may also limit the fidelity of amino acid incorporation when the frequency of the required aminoacyl-tRNAS is low (Ling et al., 2009, Zaher and Green, 2009, Czech et al., 2010). The frequency of codon pairs in RNA genomes is also a fitness determinant currently under investigation to prepare attenuated viral vaccines. In Chapter 4, additional evolutionary events related to virus-host interactions that might have contributed to codon bias are discussed.",

This applies to synonymous as well as to nonsynonymous mutations.\u2022Of the nonsynonymous mutations, those leading to chemically conservative amino acid substitutions are more likely to be tolerated than those leading to chemically different amino acids. Tolerance must be distinguished from neutrality. A tolerated mutation may cause a reduction of fitness which is nevertheless compatible with virus replication.\u2022A conservative amino acid substitution may have important biological effects.\u2022The effect of any individual mutation is context dependent in two ways: it may depend on other mutations in the same genome (epistasis, see also Section 2.8 and Chapter 5) or on the mutant cloud that surrounds the genome harboring the mutation (complementing or interfering activity).\u2022The previous points do not deny the influence of random drift of genomes on intrahost- and interhost evolution. The currently most accepted view is that selection and drift occur continuously during virus evolution (Chapter 3).\nBox 2.1The Effects of Mutations on VirusesIn Noncoding RegionsMutations may affect stem-loop or other secondary and higher order structures involved in regulatory processes through nucleic acid-nucleic acid or nucleic acid-protein interactions. The primary sequence in nonstructured, noncoding regions may be also functionally relevant.In Coding Regions\n\u2022Synonymous or silent mutations do not affect the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein.\u2022Nonsynonymous mutations give rise to an amino acid substitutions in the encoded protein.\u2022Some mutations may generate a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.\nRegarding Functional Effects\n\u2022Neutral mutations are those that have no functional effects.\u2022Nonneutral mutations can have a broad range of fitness effects: from nearly complete tolerability to lethality.\u2022Most proteins are multifunctional. A nonsynonymous mutation can affect one but not other functions performed by the same protein.\nContext DependenceThe effect of a mutation may be context dependent in two manners: it may be affected by other mutations in the same genome (epistasis) or by other genomes of the surrounding mutant spectrum.",

The effect of evolutionary distance on the transition to transversion ratio was observed in the FMDV sequence comparison carried out in our laboratory over several decades, that ranged from analyses of mutant spectra relative to their corresponding consensus sequence to the comparison of independent viral isolates from a disease outbreak [reviews of the work on FMDV evolution in (Domingo et al., 1990, Domingo et al., 2003)].

(ii) In the course of evolution, important but transient events of positive selection (termed episodic positive selection) due to one or a few amino acid substitutions may be accompanied by a larger number of synonymous, tolerated mutations. In this situation, \u03c9 will indicate purifying selection despite a critical role of positive selection triggered by one or few nonsynonymous mutations in the evolutionary outcome which are insufficient to compute as \u03c9 > 1 (Crandall et al., 1999). (iii) In a striking proof of the above arguments, statistically significant mutational biases led to a value of \u03c9 indicative of positive selection in an in vitro evolution experiment simulating pseudogene evolution in which positive selection was not possible (Vartanian et al., 2001). (iv) A synonymous change may permit a codon to acquire a relevant nonsynonymous change through a point mutation. The term quasisynonymous has been used to describe codons that encode the same amino acid, but that have a different evolutionary potential regarding the accesible amino acids in the encoded protein. Alternative codons for a given amino acid approximate a replicative system to points of sequence space from which a phenotypically relevant change has a different probability (Chapters 3 and 4). (v) Finally, it has to be considered that \u03c9 was initially proposed to compare distantly related rather than closely related genomes as is often the case in short-term evolution of viruses (Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin, 2008).",

We use \u03c9 only in a limited way in subsequent chapters, because it does not help in the interpretation of critical evolutionary events regarding viruses.

A mutation rate for a genomic site measures a biochemical event dictated by the replication machinery and environmental parameters. In contrast, a mutant or mutation frequency describes the proportion of a mutant or a set of mutants in a genome population. The frequency of a mutant will depend on the rate at which it is generated (given by the mutation rate) and on its replication capacity relative to other genomes in the population (Drake and Holland, 1999) (Figure 2.5\n). A specific mutation may be produced at a modest rate, but then be found at high frequency because the mutation is advantageous for replication in that environment. The converse situation may also occur. Some mutational hot spots (in the sense of genomic sites where mutations tend to occur with high probability) may never be reflected among the repertoire of mutations found in a genome population because of the selective disadvantage they inflict upon the genome harboring them.",

The homopolymeric tract constitutes a hot spot for variation due to polymerase slippage (Figure 2.4b). The elongation of the internal oligoadenylate was dramatic, but it was only observed when FMDV was subjected to repeated plaque-to-plaque (bottleneck) transfers, not to large population passages. In fact, this drastic genetic modification has not been recorded among natural isolates of the virus. The molecular instruction to elongate the oligoadenylate was very strong because it was observed in many independent biological clones subjected to bottleneck transfers (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1996). Despite qualifying as a hot spot for variation, the first event in fitness recovery when the clones were subjected to large population passages was the reversion of the elongated tract to its original size (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1999). The interpretation of these findings, to be further analyzed in Chapter 6, is that during plaque-to-plaque transfers the negative selection to eliminate unfit genomes is less intense than during large, highly competitive population passages. Again, a clear molecular instruction to elongate a homopolymeric track may not be reflected in a high frequency of the affected genomes. Therefore, although mutation rates and frequencies for viruses bear some relationship, rates cannot be inferred from frequencies and vice versa (Figure 2.5).",

Drake, who pursued comparative measurements that have generally supported a difference between mutation rates for DNA and RNA viruses. The rates estimated for bacteriophages \u03bb and T4 were about 100 times higher than those of their host E. coli. An approximately constant rate of 0.003 mutations per genome per replication round was calculated for a number DNA-based microbes (Drake, 1991), an observation sometimes referred to as \u201cDrake\u2019s rule.\u201d This rather surprising constancy suggests that different DNA organisms have accommodated the template-copying fidelity of their replication machineries to achieve a narrow window in the mutational load measured as mutations fixed per genome, a remarkable fitting of biochemistry with evolutionary needs. The basal mutation rate in mammalian cells has been estimated at about 10\u2212 10 substitutions per nucleotide and cell generation [reviewed in (Naegeli, 1997, Domingo et al., 2001, Friedberg et al., 2006)] (Table 2.1\n).",

Values for E. coli have ranged from 2 \u00d7 10\u2212 11 up to 5 \u00d7 10\u2212 9 substitutions per synonymous site per generation (Ochman et al., 1999) with 5 \u00d7 10\u2212 10 as the most likely estimate (Lenski et al., 2003). The latter value is in agreement with a rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u2212 10 to 4 \u00d7 10\u2212 10 substitutions per base pair and generation based on whole genome pyrosequencing of an experimentally evolved lineage of Myxococcus xanthus (Velicer et al., 2006). Mutation rates in cells and viruses depend on the replicative machinery (generally a multiprotein complex that includes the relevant viral polymerase with additional viral and host proteins and membrane structures) and on multiple environmental parameters. Whether bacteria are in the exponential or stationary phase of growth can affect intracellular metabolites and proton exchange rates which, in turn, may alter the proportion of tautomeric forms in nucleotides and misincorporation tendencies (Friedberg et al., 2006). The sequence context of the template nucleic acids (presence of repeated sequences that can induce misalignment mutagenesis or G-C vs. A-T rich regions in relation to relative nucleotide substrate abundances, etc.) may impel or attenuate mutability. Insertion elements may enhance mutation rates at neighboring sites in a bacterial genome (Miller and Day, 2004). Despite these influences, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) displayed comparable mutation rates in several host cells (Combe and Sanjuan, 2014) suggesting that there is a limited range of average error rates needed for a virus to maintain fitness (Chapters 5 and 9).",

High copying fidelity is typical of DNA polymerases involved in cellular DNA replication, and low copying fidelity is generally a feature of DNA polymerases involved in DNA repair (Friedberg et al., 2006). Thus, repair of lesions that by themselves might not be mutagenic may lead to the introduction of mutations during the error-prone repair process. (ii) Expression of proteins active in repair encoded in the viral genome, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase, DNA repair endonucleases, etc. (iii) The mechanism of viral DNA replication, particularly the occurrence of double-stranded versus single-stranded DNA in replicative intermediates. (iv) The intracellular site of replication and the availability of postreplicative DNA repair proteins (regarding both intracellular location and concentration) to the viral replication factories. Little is known of the spatial relationships and relative affinities of cellular and viral proteins and structures that may critically affect polymerase fidelity. Comparative measurements of mutation rates at specific genome sites of DNA viruses are needed, as a first step to define the cellular and biochemical influences on the fidelity of DNA virus genome replication.",

The technical details of any procedure used to calculate a mutation frequency should be carefully evaluated to translate its meaning to the genome level. Important variables are the efficacy of the antibody or drug (which will be concentration dependent) or the possibility of phenotypic hiding-mixing in the escape mutants to be quantified (Holland et al., 1989, Valcarcel and Ortin, 1989). Unexpected low levels of escape mutants (that would imply < 10\u2212 6 substitutions per nucleotide) for an RNA virus can mean either a general or site-specific high polymerase fidelity, a selective disadvantage of the genome that harbors the mutation or, when a phenotypic alteration is measured, the requirement of two or more mutations to produce the alteration. Conversely, a high mutation frequency for a DNA virus whose replication is catalyzed by a high fidelity DNA polymerase may mean that either repair activities were not functional or that the mutant displayed a selective advantage and overgrew the wild type prior to the measurement of its frequency. Mathematical treatments that take into account reversion of a low fitness mutant and its competition with wild-type virus have been used to calculate mutation rates (Batschelet et al., 1976, Coffin, 1990).",

Historically, a few early studies indicated unusual low mutation rates or frequencies for some RNA viruses. As discussed in some of the reviews listed above, there are technical reasons that suggest that such values were probably underestimates of the true average mutations rates or frequencies. Obviously, it cannot be excluded that some genomic sites or viruses under a given environment are unusually refractory to mutations, but most evidence supports the range of values listed in Table 2.1. The near million-fold higher mutation rates for RNA viruses than cellular DNA, whose biological implications were presciently anticipated by J. Holland and colleagues (Holland et al., 1982), have been confirmed. That is, for RNA viruses of genome length between 3Kb and 32 Kb, an average of 0.1-1 mutations are introduced per template molecule copied in the replicating population. Unless most mutations impeded viral replication, a continuous input of mutant genomes is expected, as indeed found experimentally (Chapter 3).",

The change in fidelity can reach almost one order of magnitude, but virus viability is not compromised. Thus, error rates themselves can be subjected to selection, as supported by theoretical studies on evolvability (Earl and Deem, 2004). It is not clear whether mutation rates of viruses have evolved to procure a balance between adaptability and genetic stability, or whether other selective constraints have imposed the observed values. It has been suggested that because of the generally deleterious nature of most mutations, the adaptive value of the high mutation rates for RNA viruses is debatable, and that there might have been a trade-off between replication rate and copying fidelity (Elena and Sanjuan, 2005). Mutation rates would be a consequence of rapid RNA replication, and an increase in copying fidelity would come at a cost, resulting in a lower replication rate. A connection between elongation and error rate has been suggested by results with some viral and cellular polymerases [review (Kunkel and Erie, 2005)]. In an early study with the poliovirus RdRp in vitro, an increase in the error frequency was observed when the pH-Mg2 + ion conditions were modified, and the decreased fidelity correlated with increased RNA elongation rate (Ward et al., 1988). A possible connection between elongation rate and copying fidelity cannot be ruled out, but current evidence points to template-copying fidelity as being the result of multiple factors, not necessarily linked to the rate of genome replication (Vignuzzi and Andino, 2010; Campagnola et al. 2015).",

A poliovirus mutant, whose RdRp displayed a three- to fivefold higher fidelity than the wild-type enzyme, replicated at a slightly lower rate than wild-type virus in cell culture, but displayed a strong selective disadvantage regarding invasion of the brain of susceptible mice (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006). The impediment to cause neuropathology was due to the limited complexity of the mutant spectrum since its broadening through mutagenesis restored the capacity to produce neuropathology. These and other studies have provided evidence that mutant spectrum complexity, by virtue of its impact on fitness, can be a virulence determinant. The work by M. Vignuzzi, J. Pfeiffer, R. Andino, C. Cameron, K. Kirkegaard, and their colleagues on poliovirus fidelity mutants opened a much needed branch of research in virus evolution and quasispecies implications. As a proof of this statement, the field of fidelity mutants is rapidly expanding, and references to the information they provide will be made in several chapters.",

            "text": "Theoretical models and experimental observations suggest that mechanisms for error correction had to evolve to maintain functionality of increasingly complex genomes (Swetina and Schuster, 1982, Eigen and Biebricher, 1988, Domingo et al., 2001, Eigen, 2002, Eigen, 2013) (here complexity means genome size, provided no redundant information is encoded). The coronaviruses have the largest genomes among the known RNA viruses, with 30-33 kb. This is about 10-fold more genetic information than encoded in the simple RNA bacteriophages such as MS2 or Q\u03b2. Coronaviruses are replicated by complex RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which include a domain that corresponds to a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease, proofreading-repair activity. The protein displays exonuclease activity in vitro, and its inactivation affects viral RNA synthesis (Minskaia et al., 2006), and results in increases of about 15-fold in the average mutation frequency (Eckerle et al., 2007, Eckerle et al., 2010). A coronavirus mutant devoid of this repair function is more susceptible to lethal mutagenesis (Smith et al., 2013, Smith and Denison, 2013), as expected from a connection between replication accuracy and proximity to an error threshold for the maintenance of genetic information (Chapter 9). Thus, it is likely that a proofreading activity evolved (or was captured from a cellular counterpart) in RNA genomes whose genomic complexity was in the limit compatible with the fidelity achievable by standard RNA replicases. It would be interesting to discover new RNA viruses with a single RNA molecule longer than 30 Kb as genome to analyze whether they have evolved more accurate core polymerases or exhibit a proofreading-repair function during replication. Toward the other end of the RNA size scale, viroid RNAs display a mutation rate higher than (or close to the highest) recorded for RNA viruses, consistent with the correlation between genome size and template-copying accuracy (Gago et al., 2009).",

The error rate would decrease to 10\u2212 5 to 10\u2212 6 with base selection and proofreading-repair, to about 10\u2212 7 with the contribution of additional proteins present in the replication complex, and to about 10\u2212 10 misincorporations per nucleotide with the participation of postreplicative mismatch correction mechanisms (Naegeli, 1997, Kunkel and Erie, 2005, Friedberg et al., 2006). The error rate of the bacteriophage \u03d529 DNA polymerase is about 10\u2212 6 without the proofreading exonuclease activity, and it decreases to 10\u2212 8 with the correcting activity [(de Vega et al., 2010) and references therein].

Elevated mutation rates in the range of those operating for RNA viruses would be lethal for mammalian genomes. Localized genetic modification occur physiologically in processes such as somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination in B cells of the germinal centers, as mechanisms of diversification of immunoglobulin genes (Upton et al., 2011). Chromosomal instability has long been associated with cancer (Gatenby and Frieden, 2004, Stratton et al., 2009). Surveys have been (and are currently being) used to identify genes associated with chromosomal instability and their role in aging and disease (Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2013) (see also Chapter 10). While uncontrolled high mutability is deleterious for differentiated cellular organisms, it constitutes a modus vivendi for a great majority of viruses.",

Exceptions to the absence of repair activities in simple genetic elements have been described. A satellite RNA of the plant virus turnip crinkle carmovirus evolved a 3\u2032-end RNA repair mechanism. It implicates the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides by the viral replicase using the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome as template. The mechanism consists probably of template-independent priming at the 3\u2032-end of the damaged RNA to generate wild type, negative strand, and satellite RNA (Nagy and Simon, 1997). A reversible, NTP-dependent excision of the 3\u2032residue of the nascent nucleic acid product has been described in some retroviruses and hepatitis C virus (Meyer et al., 1998, Jin et al., 2013). This activity is important for drug resistance and it may also modulate the overall fidelity of some polymerases. It cannot be excluded that some type of point mutation correction may operate in RNA genetic elements of less than 30 Kb. Such putative mechanisms may even diminish mutation rates that would otherwise be prohibitively deleterious, and they do not overshadow high mutation rates as a feature of RNA and some DNA genomes (Table 2.1).",

Three-dimensional structures of viral RdRps and RTs indicate that interactions between the incoming nucleotide or residues of the template-primer with amino acids of the polymerase must permit displacement of the growing polymerase chain along the channel located at the palm domain of the polymerase (Steitz, 1999, Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006) (Figure 2.6b).

One of the several steps involved in nucleotide incorporation is the formation of a ternary complex (polymerase with template-primer and the incoming nucleotide) that undergoes a conformational change (reorientation of the divalent ion-complexed triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide). This conformational change activates the complex for phosphoryl transfer, to link the nucleoside-monophosphate to the 3\u2032-terminus of the primer (or growing chain). Steps involved in the nucleotide incorporation are represented in Figure 2.6c. Both the conformational change and the relative rate of phosphoryl transfer for an incorrect nucleotide versus the correct nucleotide influence the error rate at each site of the growing chain. Critical kinetic constants in Figure 2.6c that are determined experimentally to quantify relative nucleotide incorporations and misincorporations are Kd,app (expressed as \u03bcM), kpol (expressed as s\u2212 1), and the ratio kpol/Kd,app (\u03bcM\u2212 1\n s\u2212 1) termed the catalytic efficiency. The ratio of kpol/Kd,app for the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide to kpol/Kd,app for a correct nucleotide gives the frequency of that particular misincorporation, and an assessment of polymerase fidelity [(Castro et al., 2005) and references therein]. Modifications of polymerase residues by site-directed mutagenesis, combined with comparisons of the relevant structures, have identified critical amino acid residues involved in template-copying fidelity.",

Limited incorporation of a deleterious nucleotide can be attained either through a specific discrimination against the analog (ribavirin or other) or through a general decrease of all types of misincorporations, that is, a high fidelity phenotype. Structural modifications of viral polymerases that lead to high fidelity have inspired the design and testing of additional substitutions. In this manner, mutant viral polymerases showing either an increase or decrease of copying fidelity achieved through a single amino acid substitution have been characterized (Wainberg et al., 1996, Men\u00e9ndez-Arias, 2002, Mansky et al., 2003, Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003, Arnold et al., 2005, Domingo, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006, Coffey et al., 2011, Gnadig et al., 2012, Meng and Kwang, 2014, Rozen-Gagnon et al., 2014; Borderia et al., 2016).

Biased hypermutation was first observed in some defective-interfering (DI) RNAs of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Holland et al., 1982), and in variant forms of measles virus, associated with postmeasles neurological disease such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Cattaneo and Billeter, 1992). Hypermutation is mainly due to the activity of cellular deaminases such as, the apolipoprotein B mRNA and the editing complex (APOBEC), or the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR) families, that are involved in cellular editing and regulatory functions (Sheehy et al., 2002, Santiago and Greene, 2008, Nishikura, 2010, Stavrou et al., 2014). In the event of a viral infection, such cellular functions can become part of an innate defense mechanism against the invading virus. Viral proteins (i.e., Vif in HIV-1) bind some APOBEC proteins thus inhibiting mutagenesis and permitting virus survival (Sheehy et al., 2002). In oncoretroviruses, retroviruses, and hepatitis B virus (HBV), the APOBEC-3 cytidine deaminase acts on single-stranded DNA and results mainly in G \u2192 A and C \u2192 U hypermutation, that may affect 40% to 100% of the G residues. The preferred sequence context for G hypermutation in HIV-1 observed in vivo is GpA > GpG > GpT \u2248 GpC. The specific dinucleotide context of the hypermutated sites provides a means to distinguish genomes that have undergone hypermutation by cellular activities from those that are heavily mutated by other mechanism such as the action of mutagenic agents (Chapter 9).",

A transition mutation that causes a strong fitness decrease but that still allows residual RNA genome replication, will most likely revert following infection or transfection of cells with the mutant construct. Double or triple mutants (preferentially including transversions) should be engineered (when possible according to the genetic code) to study the behavior of a viral mutant with an amino acid replacement of interest that may produce a fitness decrease. As an example, a C \u2192 U transition found in an open-reading frame of an RNA virus may convert a Pro into a Ser (CCG \u2192 UCG). Since Ser will revert to Pro through a U \u2192 C transition in the triplet (a common type of misincorporation by most polymerases), Ser should be engineered to be encoded by AGU; in the course of replication, reversion to Pro would require at least two transversions since the codons for Pro are CCU, CCC, CCA, or CCG. Thus, if effects derived from the difference in primary sequence of the RNA or codon bias do not intervene in the behavior of the viral genome, codons with a high genetic barrier to reversion should be engineered for studies involving viral replication.",

High mutation rates also imply that infection or transfection with debilitated mutant viruses may result in progeny with sequences that differ from the input. V. I. Agol and colleagues have coined the term quasi-infectious to refer to mutant viruses that are capable of yielding progeny, but the progeny differs from the initial genome (pseudorevertants) (Gmyl et al., 1993). The difference between the input mutant and the rescued progeny virus will depend on the type of genetic lesion in the input virus and its consequences for replication. A single point mutation that decreases replication is likely to lead to a true revertant (return to the original sequence). If the same reversion depends on two or more mutations, a true revertant will be generated only after extended replication to achieve the required exploration of sequence space (Chapter 3). In this case, selection of compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome (sometimes referred to as second site revertants) is likely. The term compensatory is often used for mutations that compensate the deleterious effects of other mutations. A typical example is a mutation that decreases the stability of a stem in an RNA stem-loop that functions as a cis-acting element. Frequently, a compensatory mutation occurs that restores a stable stem. Thus, an engineered virus may produce progeny which differs from the parent. There is an uncertainty regarding the representativeness of a virus mutant or construct when the objective is to infer the behavior of genetic lesions in the natural context. If a substantial loss of replicative capacity is produced by a drastic genetic change (an indel, loss of a stem-loop structure, etc.) selection of a true revertant becomes extremely unlikely. The compensatory generation of alternative structures (or constellations of point mutations) that restore replication (partially or completely) becomes an interesting and informative possibility.",

If for technical reasons an infectious cDNA clone is constructed from several molecules which were copied from different genomes present in the mutant spectrum, the ligation product may be transcribed into an RNA which is not infectious. This is because while some constellations of mutations may be compatible with infectivity, others may not, or may allow limited, suboptimal replication, thus favoring the selection of additional mutations or reversions. The effect of different mutations in the same genome is often referred to as epistasis. Mutations that reinforce each other with regard to a viral function are said to produce positive epistasis and those that interfere with each other produce negative epistasis. Thus, a mutation may have an effect on its own, and an effect that depends on accompanying mutations in the same genome (also mentioned regarding the context-dependent effect of mutations in Section 2.3). Epistasis in RNA viruses may be blurred by the considerable weight of mutant spectra in determining viral behavior through intergenome interactions (Chapter 3).",

Engineered \u03d529 DNA polymerases provide a powerful amplification tool in genomics (de Vega et al., 2010). In contrast, the 4,220 nucleotides long Q\u03b2 RNA rapidly loses its infectivity when replicated by Q\u03b2 replicase in vitro due to accumulation of mutations and deletions in the viral RNA (Mills et al., 1967, Sabo et al., 1977).

Reverse transcriptase participates in strand transfer during DNA synthesis, and coronavirus polymerase switches from one template site to another during discontinuous RNA synthesis. It may be significant that they belong to viral families displaying high recombination frequencies (Makino et al., 1986).

A commonly used procedure measures similarity values between sequences using a sliding-window scanning method. The recombination crossover point (where the two parental sequences meet) is identified by the point (or region) where the similarity plot crosses from one sequence into another (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004, Martin et al., 2005, Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006). Crossover points along a viral genome are not distributed at random, either because polymerase detachment from the template is sequence dependent or because many of the recombination events do not lead to viable progeny. Absence of recombinant viability introduces a parallel with the distinction we made in Section 2.5 between mutation rate and frequency; that is, a distinction between what does occur and what is observed. Many newly arising recombinants may be subjected to negative selection, and only a viable subset of all recombinants produced might be detectable in progeny virus (King, 1988, Lai, 1992). Thus, as in the case of mutations, many recombinant genomes are not detected because of their elimination by negative selection. An elegant study by D.J. Evans and colleagues documented \u201cimprecise\u201d enterovirus recombinant intermediates that were lost upon serial virus passage (Lowry et al., 2014).

In the case of the nanovirus Faba bean necrotic stunt virus, its 8 segments vary in frequency in a host-dependent manner (Sicard et al., 2013). This observation led the authors to propose a \u201csetpoint genome formula\u201d which may reflect a control of segment (gene) copy number that may provide some still unrecognized benefit to the multipartite phenotype (see next section). In principle, replication of multipartite viruses requires that each cell be coinfected by at least one of each type or particle harboring a different genome type, which in fact represents a remarkable cost for replicative efficiency. The fact that unsegmented and segmented RNA viruses are well represented in our biosphere suggests that neither of the two organizations confers a definitive advantage for long-term survival.",

An alternative, not mutually exclusive model, is that genome segmentation may have an advantage because replication of shorter RNA molecules is completed earlier than the unsegmented counterpart (Nee, 1987). Yet another possibility is that the life style of a virus (in particular, the particle yield in connection with the number of surrounding susceptible cells), established over long evolutionary periods, may favor segmentation over intactness of a genetic message or vice versa.",

Its single-stranded RNA genome underwent a modification akin to genome segmentation when the standard virus was subjected to more than 200 passages in BHK-21 cells at high multiplicity of infection. The experiment was originally intended to investigate the limits of fitness gain during virus optimization in a defined environment, in this case BHK-21 cells in culture. The FMDV used was a biological clone obtained in BHK-21 cells; the virus had not adapted to the BHK-21 cell environment since it derived from a diseased swine during a disease outbreak. Upon extensive replication in BHK-21 cells, the virus evolved toward a bipartite genome (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004) thus adding reassortment to mutation and recombination as potential mechanisms of genetic variation of this laboratory-adapted picornavirus.",

Each segment in isolation could not infect cells productively, but, when present together, they were infectious by complementation, and killed cells in the absence of standard FMDV. Low multiplicity of infection rapidly selected the full length genome as a result of recombination of the two parental, defective segments (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004). The particles containing the shortened RNA were thermically more stable than the standard particles (Ojosnegros et al., 2011), but this difference did not explain the initial trigger of the segmentation event. The solution to this question came with the demonstration that the transition toward genome segmentation was possible because of an extensive exploration of sequence space by the standard virus. Indeed, the mutations accumulated during serial passages enhanced fitness of the segmented genome version to a much higher extent than fitness of the standard genome, thus conferring a selective advantage to the segmented form over its unsegmented (monopartite) counterpart (Moreno et al., 2014) (Figure 2.8). Thus, in this segmentation event, gradual evolution (drift in sequence space) was a requirement for the major transition toward segmentation. This experimental result suggests that in evolution there is no unsurmountable barrier that allows the conversion between intact and split forms of the same genome, reflecting a remarkable genome flexibility that will be emphasized in Chapter 7 in the context of the relevance of virus variation in the emergence of viral pathogens.",

Sometimes one form of genetic change appears to be more prominent than another, and sometimes the concerted action of recombination or reassortment with mutation is apparent [i.e., antigenic drift in influenza virus, following the origin of a new antigenic type through reassortment (Ghedin et al., 2005)]. Mutation is a universal form of genetic change. It underlies numerous adaptive responses and critical biological transitions in viruses, and it is a prerequisite for recombination and reassortment to have a biological impact. If mutations were not present in different template molecules during replication, recombinants with the crossover point at equivalent positions of the parental genomes would be \u201csilent,\u201d and display the same behavior as the parental genomes. Apparently \u201csilent\u201d recombination events may take place within replicative units; even if some mutations distinguished individual genomes of the same quasispecies swarm, a recombinant would not be distinguished from a mutant genome. The frequency of recombination in HIV-1 was noticed only when the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic had advanced and the virus had diversified through accumulation of mutations. Similar arguments apply to segment reassortment. Genomes necessitate mutation-driven diversification for reassortment to provide a biological advantage (see also Chapter 10).",

Holland and their colleagues on the generation of VSV DI\u2019s and their interplay with the standard, infectious VSV contributed to unveil a continuous dynamics of genetic variation, competition, and selection, observable within short time intervals, a hallmark of RNA genetics (Palma and Huang, 1974, Holland et al., 1982). Despite the continuous dynamics of escape of infectious virus to the interfering activities of DIs, some authors consider DIs as potential antiviral agents (Dimmock and Easton, 2014). DI RNAs can be regarded as the tip of the iceberg of many classes of defective genomes with a range of interfering or potentiating capacities that may coexist with standard animal, plant, insect, and bacterial viruses, and that may facilitate persistence and modulate disease symptoms (Holland et al., 1982, Vogt and Jackson, 1999, L\u00f3pez-Ferber et al., 2003, Rosario et al., 2005, Sachs and Bull, 2005, Villarreal, 2005, Aaskov et al., 2006). Noncytopathic coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) variants with deletions at the untranslated 5\u2032-genomic region were isolated from hearts of mice inoculated with CVB3. The variants replicated in vivo and were associated with long-term viral persistence (Kim et al., 2005).",

In other terms, genetic variation sets the scene for the actors of evolution to play their roles, and secure a continuous input of new forms despite subtle or catastrophic environmental perturbations. The same forces that drive general evolution have produced the dominant virus forms we see in nature, with all their nuances in the interaction with cell components. The adaptation of viruses to participate in intracellular processes with cells dictates that genetic variation of viruses has its limits to prevent deleteriousness. This is currently exemplified by the effects of amino acid substitutions in viral polymerases that either increase or decrease template-copying fidelity. Viruses have reached a compromise between stability of a core information and flexibility for adaptability. Although not yet treated in this chapter, viral population numbers are a key parameter in the evolutionary events. Next chapters address some of these questions, not only in general conceptual terms but also in the way evolution affects our daily confrontation with viral disease (see Summary Box).Summary Box\n\u2022Mutation, recombination and genome segment reassortment are the mechanisms of genetic variation used by DNA and RNA viruses. Mutations are due mainly to changes in the electronic distributions of the standard nucleotides, to damage of nucleotides by external influences, and by alignment alterations of template relative to product polynucleotide chains. The effect of a mutation can range from being well tolerated to highly detrimental or lethal.\u2022Mutation frequencies are only an indirect consequence of mutation rates. Their values for viruses whose replication is catalyzed by polymerases devoid of proofreading-repair activity are 105 to 106-fold higher than those displayed by replicative cellular DNA polymerases. Error-prone replication is a hallmark of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses. The larger the amount of genetic information encoded in a viral genome, the lower the mutation rate must be to maintain the genetic message.\u2022Several mechanisms of genetic recombination have been described for DNA and RNA viruses. The best characterized is homologous recombination whose frequency of occurrence is dependent on the replicative machinery, in particular polymerase processivity. Genome segment reassortment is operative in segmented genomes and it gives rise to biologically relevant changes such as antigenic shift in the influenza type A viruses.\u2022Studies with foot-and-mouth disease virus have shown that extensive evolution of an unsegmented RNA genome has the potential to undergo a recombination-mediated transition akin to genome segmentation. Therefore, segmented and unsegmented forms of RNA viruses need not be considered as completely unrelated classes of genome organization.\u2022Recombination and genome segment reassortment have been viewed as conservative forces to rescue viable genomes from a damaged pool, and also as means to explore new genomic compositions that deviate from their parents. All forms of genetic variation give rise to repertoires of variant genomes on which selection and random drift act to produce the viral forms that we isolate and study.\n\n",
