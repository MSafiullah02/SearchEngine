            "text": "Considerable economic losses may be incurred from neonatal diseases during calf rearing. In 2006, 8% of pre-weaned heifers and 2% of weaned heifers died primarily due to diarrhea and other gastrointestinal illnesses (NAHMS, 2010). Similarly in pediatrics, diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years in developing countries and is estimated to cause 3 million deaths annually (Bhutta et al., 2000, Hoque et al., 2009). In 2004, based on numerous randomized clinical trials, the World Health Organization recommended zinc supplementation of oral rehydration solutions to decrease the duration and severity of infant diarrhea (Bhutta et al., 1999, Faruque et al., 1999, Penny et al., 1999). Infants with diarrhea for more than 10 days had significantly lower serum zinc levels compared to healthy infants or infants with other non-gastrointestinal illnesses (Naveh et al., 1982), suggesting gastrointestinal loss of zinc (Hoque et al., 2009). Zinc-supplemented ORS also resulted in increased recovery rates, reduced mortality and a reduction in use of antibiotics (Bhandari et al., 2008, Bhutta et al., 2000, Bhutta et al., 1999). Although the exact underlying mode of action of zinc is still not known, (Hoque et al., 2009) a mucosal-protective role, enhanced cell-mediated immunity, and modification of intra-luminal electrolyte secretion and absorption mechanisms have been proposed (Atia and Buchman, 2009, Fischer Walker et al., 2009, Hoque et al., 2009). Similar benefits of zinc-supplemented ORS on diarrhea in calves could significantly impact the economics and sustainability of the production system by reducing antibiotic use for treatment of calf diarrhea. Zinc studies have demonstrated its beneficial effects in piglets and rats, and on calf growth and fetal development (Graham et al., 2010, Graham et al., 1984, Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003). However, the therapeutic use of zinc in calves with diarrhea has not been studied. A comparison of inorganic and organic formulations of zinc such as zinc oxide (ZO) and zinc methionine (Met), respectively, is warranted because of differences in zinc bioavailability (Wedekind et al., 1992). A greater effectiveness of an inorganic zinc formulation in treating calf diarrhea compared to an organic formulation may be evidence of zinc's local intra-luminal mode of action given its poor absorption in the intestines (absorption coefficient of ZO = 0.12 compared to 0.40 for zinc Met) (Cousins, 1985). On the other hand, if zinc Met is found to be more effective than ZO in treating diarrhea this may be evidence for a systemic mode of action given the greater bioavailability of zinc Met compared to ZO. In addition, because zinc is an antagonist of copper (NRC, 2001), a comprehensive assessment of trace minerals is necessary when administering zinc to calves.",

Calves enrolled included all male Holsteins that developed diarrhea for the first time between 1 and 8 days of age. Calves were excluded from the study if they had a previous incident of diarrhea since birth or signs of disease other than diarrhea, such as an umbilical abscess, pneumonia, or meningitis, or if they were previously treated with antimicrobial drugs.

All calves on the calf ranch received the same diet in the hutches consisting of 2 L of milk replacer twice daily, free access to water, and a calf starter grain mix. The electrolyte powder is a proprietary mix and was submitted for heavy metal analysis; it contains 4.5 ppm iron. All other heavy metals were not detected. Pretrial samples collected from the water contained no detectable zinc. Calf starter grain contained 22 mg/kg zinc DM, and milk replacer had 2.4 mg/kg zinc DM. Calves were randomized by a veterinarian (AG) to one of the 3 treatments in blocks that ranged from 3 to 15 calves depending on the number of calves eligible at each enrollment day. The randomization scheme was generated using Microsoft Excel 2010 by a different veterinarian (SA). Treatments (placebo, zinc Met, or ZO) were placed into 2.0 ml locking-lid microcentrifuge tubes with polypropylene snap-cap (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and labeled 1, 2, or 3 (SA). Treatment allocation, administration and data recording were performed by AG while being blinded to the true treatments until completion of the trial. Success of blinding and randomization at producing comparable groups was evaluated by comparing baseline values at enrollment using ANOVA for clinical parameters (Table 1\n) and trace mineral concentrations (Table 2\n). Calves received a single daily oral dose of either 99.69 mg of a zinc-free placebo (electrolyte powder used to make ORS; group 1), 381.54 mg of zinc Met (equivalent to 80 mg of zinc; group 2), or 99.69 mg of ZO (equivalent to 80 mg of zinc; group 3) dissolved in 2 L of a zinc-free ORS solution. The dose of 80 mg zinc per day was based on the ratio of human zinc nutrient requirement (NHMRC, 2005) to zinc supplementation of ORS (1:6.7) (Bhandari et al., 2008, Bhutta et al., 1999, Patel et al., 2009). This was verified to be less than the ratio in calves of recommended zinc intake (NRC, 2001) to toxic levels (1:37.5) (Graham et al., 1988, Graham et al., 1987b).",

As part of the physical examination the rectal temperature (\u00b0C), fecal consistency, and attitude were scored for each calf. Fecal output was scored by a single veterinarian (AG) after adapting fecal scores from the University of Wisconsin's calf health scoring chart (http://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/dms/fapm/fapmtools/8calf/calf_health_scoring_chart.pdf). A fecal sample that was solid, semi-formed/loose, or watery was assigned 1, 2 or 3, respectively. A decision was made to merge the original chart's semi-formed and loose categories for consistency given the potential for difficulty distinguishing between both on the raised slatted wooden floors of calf hutches. A similar simple scoring system for calf attitude was followed. A calf with an attitude score of 1 was standing, bright, alert, responsive and had a good suckle reflex; a score 2 calf stood only after stimulation and had a moderate suckle reflex; and a score 3 calf was recumbent, did not stand with stimulation and had a weak or absent suckle reflex. After enrollment, fecal consistency and attitude for all trial calves were recorded every other day. Fecal and venous blood samples were collected at enrollment, every other day thereafter, and at exit from trial. In addition, a liver biopsy (Swanson et al., 2000) was collected from each calf at enrollment and exit. Calves enrolled were followed up every other day (physical exam, blood and fecal samples collected) and continued receiving their allocated treatment until clinical signs resolved (normal rectal temperature, no diarrhea for 24\u201348 h, and attitude score of 1) or for a maximum of 14 days at which time calves were eligible for exit.",

This is in contrast to studies on infants that reported a significant reduction in diarrhea-associated mortality after oral zinc supplementation (Bhandari et al., 2008, Bhutta et al., 2000). The difference in findings between the pediatric trials and our calf trial may be explained by the differences in pathogens or disease severity since pediatric research was conducted on diseased infants with more severe clinical signs and a greater risk of mortality compared to calves in our trial. Other explanations for the lack of significant differences among the treatment groups may be due to a sub-therapeutic zinc dose (trial dose provided 80 mg of available zinc/day), or a small sample size. Indeed, estimates of power analyses from the current data show evidence of low sample size.",

Total zinc was measured in feces (mg/kg DW), and thus we are not able to differentiate between the different forms of zinc. It is known that fecal excretion of zinc increases as the intake of zinc increases in humans, so it is possible that zinc Met was absorbed, metabolized to other forms of zinc, and then excreted via the intestine and bile (Cousins, 1985, Spencer et al., 1985). This trend did not continue for calves treated for more than 10 days. Calves in the trial for more than 10 days and supplemented with zinc Met had significantly higher serum and liver zinc concentrations than the placebo treated calves. These findings are consistent with the increased bioavailability of zinc Met compared to ZO (absorption coefficient of zinc Met = 0.40 compared to 0.12 for ZO) reported by Cousins (1985).",

In addition, liver zinc mean (SEM) concentrations vary from 1110 (193) mg/kg DW during 120\u2013170 days of gestation to 716 (385) mg/kg DW during 221\u2013270 days of gestation (Abdelrahman and Kincaid, 1993). The zinc concentration of bovine colostrum and milk is 15 \u03bcg/ml and 3\u20135 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In the current study, all calves were fed formulated milk replacer containing 2.4 mg/kg zinc DW, the equivalent of 0.29 \u03bcg zinc/ml as fed (Abdelrahman and Kincaid, 1993). The National Research Council (NRC) daily zinc recommendation for calves is 40 mg/kg of total diet. There is a significant effect of age on liver zinc concentrations in calves in that the liver zinc concentrations decrease with time after birth (Puschner et al., 2004a). The low levels found in colostrum and milk replacer may reflect adequate tissue reserves of zinc in the bovine neonate (Abdelrahman and Kincaid, 1993, NRC, 2001). Thus if calves are born with adequate zinc stores in the liver and do not require much in the diet, our trial dose of 80 mg of zinc/day was likely too low to have an effect. At exit, trial calves treated with zinc Met had significantly higher fecal (P\n < 0.01) and serum zinc (P\n = 0.02) concentrations compared to the placebo group. Despite zinc Met being more bioavailable, it was excreted in the feces. This further indicates that calves have adequate zinc body stores and our trial dose may have been too low to have an effect.",

It is known that clinical signs and death from zinc toxicosis can occur in pre-ruminant calves fed 700 \u03bcg zinc/g (mg/kg) diet for 30 days (Graham et al., 1987a). In previous studies where 3\u201338 day old male Holstein calves were fed milk replacers containing 40, 200, 500, 700, or 1000 mg/kg of zinc, weight gains, DM intakes, and feed efficiencies were reduced at the 700 and 1000 mg/kg level (Jenkins and Hidiroglou, 1991). The calves in the current trial were being fed a formulated milk replacer made on the calf ranch that contained 2.4 mg/kg zinc. The addition of an additional 80 mg of zinc resulted in a total zinc level well below the toxic dose of 700 \u03bcg/g of zinc assuming they were fed 1 gallon or 3.79 kg of milk per day. Approximately, total zinc intake level was (3.79 kg \u00d7 2.4 mg) + 80 mg = 89.1 mg. Previous research indicated that calves require anywhere from 9 to 14 mg/kg of zinc in their total diet to maintain adequate plasma levels, but that up to 40 mg/kg of dietary zinc may be required according to the NRC (Herrick, 1974, NRC, 2001). Thus, the therapeutic dose is not known for this age of Holstein calves, and this information suggests that there may be a wide range among tolerance, therapeutic, and toxic levels.",

The sample size at the current study permitted a power of 19.9% to detect significant daily weight gain in the zinc MET group compared to the placebo group. As discussed earlier, sample size determination for this study was based on a study in infants that detected a statistically significant difference between children with gastro-intestinal illness and healthy infants and infants with diseases other than diarrhea (Naveh et al., 1982). This approach may be inappropriate for detecting a significant difference in neonatal Holstein calves. Given our study findings, the sample size needed to detect a statistically significant difference in mean daily weight change between the placebo group (\u221266.88 g/day, SD 296.16) and the zinc Met group (40.24 g/day, SD 374.53) given a power of 90% is 213 calves per group. Such a number can be easily attained on most dairy or calf ranches in California.",

In addition, the hazard for clinical cure in calves that tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. or coronavirus at enrollment when treated with ZO were greater than the respective hazards in calves treated with a placebo. With respect to microbiological cure, calves that tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. at enrollment and treated with zinc Met had 16 times higher odds of microbiological cure (being pathogen test negative at exit) than calves in the placebo group. Given the magnitude of the association (OR = 16) and it is respective power estimate of 72.3%, further studies are required to investigate the effect of zinc Met on microbiological prevention and cure from cryptosporidiosis in dairy calves. The lethal dose (LD 50) for such zinc formulation for different age groups would need to be estimated through formal toxicity studies to guide the dairy industry in the use of an optimal dose for zinc therapeutic treatment in calf diarrhea to avoid accidental intoxication.",

Furthermore, the study was conducted on a large calf ranch in California which may differ in preweaned calf management on dairies. Important differences may include less variability in preweaned calf diets and more closely followed standard protocols for calf health monitoring and treatments. Despite such limitations, results of the current double blind clinical trial show that there may be a positive impact of zinc on calf health management including decrease in use of antimicrobial drugs.",
