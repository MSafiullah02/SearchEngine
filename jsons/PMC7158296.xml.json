Hamsters are classified as members of the order Rodentia, suborder Myomorpha, superfamily Muroidea, and in family Cricetidae. Animals in this family are characterized by large cheek pouches, thick bodies, short tails, and an excess of loose skin. They have incisors that erupt continuously and cuspidate molars that do not continue to grow ((I 1/1, C 0/0, PM 0/0, M 3/3) \u00d7 2 = 16). In 2010, it was reported that approximately 146,000 hamsters were used in research in the United States (United States Department of Agriculture, 2010).",

In their native environment, hamsters live in deep tunnels that provide cooler temperatures and higher humidity than the general desert environment. They are nocturnal animals in the laboratory, but field research has shown diurnal activity in females in the wild (Gattermann et al., 2008). The adult Syrian hamster usually grows to a length of 6\u20138 inches (14\u201319 cm) and weighs between 110 and 140 g. The adult female of this breed tends to be larger than the male. The hamster has a small blunt tail and smooth, short hair. Normal coloration is reddish gold, with a grayish-white ventrum. Hair-coat colors also include cream, albino, piebald, and cinnamon; the length of hair can also vary (Harkness et al., 2010). Hamster ears are pointed, with dark pigmentation, and the eyes are small, dark, and bright. Male hamsters can be identified by prominent flank glands and by large testicles that protrude behind the body on each side of the tail. The normal gross anatomy for the golden hamster has been described in this section (Hoffman et al., 1968, Murray, 2012).",

The use of the golden hamster as a laboratory animal was initiated by Saul Adler, who sought a laboratory animal susceptible to infection with Leishmania (Adler, 1948). Only three littermates, one male and two females, were retained in captivity, and it is the progeny of these animals that were first imported to the United States in 1938. By 1973, the hamster had become the third most commonly used laboratory animal in the United States, behind mice and rats. Hamster use in research has steadily declined by approximately 67% since its peak in the early 1970s; currently hamsters are less frequently used than mice, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs (United States Department of Agriculture, 2010).",

They are also used extensively to study pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through the administration of nitrosamines (Konishi et al., 1998, Uchida et al., 2008) or via the transplantable cell line, PGHAM-1, which models metastatic pancreatic cancer (Fukuhara et al., 2005, Uchida et al., 2008). The hamster is also susceptible to respiratory tract tumors and can be induced to develop nonsmall cell lung carcinoma through a course of injections of the carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), with or without the addition of hyperoxia (Oreffo et al., 1993, Sunday et al., 1995). The role of Simian virus 40 (SV40), a polyomavirus, in human cancers remains controversial (Rollison et al., 2004); however, the hamster remains a valuable model for investigation of this viral disease process. Hamsters injected with SV40 develop a variety of tumors depending on the route of inoculation and the age of hamster when inoculated (Allison et al., 1967, Cicala et al., 1993, Sroller et al., 2008). Additionally, the Syrian hamster is used to study the effects of exogenous estrogenic compounds on tumor development, with 100% of male hamsters developing renal tumors after the administration of estrogens (Li and Li, 1996; Liehr, 1997). Finally, the hamster is one of the few animal models that permit the replication of human adenoviruses, which holds promise as a potential cancer therapeutic (Hjorth et al., 1988, Thomas et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Hamsters, like humans, are highly susceptible to metabolic diseases and present with several related clinical signs and syndromes. The hamster is commonly used as a model for cholesterol cholelithiasis, which can be induced via excess dietary cholesterol or by feeding a sucrose-rich diet (Cohen et al., 1989, Khallou et al., 1991, Trautwein et al., 1999). Hamsters are also susceptible to diabetes mellitus induced by differing methods. Chemical agents such as streptozotocin (STZ) or alloxan can be used; however, STZ may be more effective and reliable than alloxan (Phares, 1980). The addition of nicotinamide (dosed intraperitoneally) at 15 min before STZ injection results in partial protection against the beta-cytotoxic effect of STZ, resulting in partial preservation of insulin stores (Fararh et al., 2002, Masiello et al., 1998). Diabetes mellitus can also be induced via dietary modifications. A high-fat (15%) diet containing modest cholesterol (0.12%) fed for three weeks will induce type 2 diabetes along with related comorbidities such as obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia (Van Heek et al., 2001). Syrian hamsters of the albino-panda-albino (APA) strain develop diabetes with nephropathy following STZ injections and also develop coronary lesions (Horiuchi et al., 2005). Syrian hamsters possess similar lipid metabolism to humans and are useful models for atherosclerosis, induced via dietary manipulation (Mitchell and McLeod, 2008, Simionescu et al., 1993, Wissler, 1991).",

Cardiomyopathy in the Syrian hamster is a naturally occurring, inherited condition and, as such, is an established animal model for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the hamster, both DCM and HCM are caused by a defect in the sarcoglycan gene, a component of the dystrophin complex (Bajusz et al., 1969, Escobales and Crespo, 2006, Escobales and Crespo, 2008, Goineau et al., 2001, Ikeda and Ross, 2000, Lipskaia et al., 2007, Ryoke et al., 1999, Sakamoto et al., 1997). Cardiomyopathic hamster lines include the original polymyopathic line 1.50, as well as BIO 82.62, BIO TO-2, BIO 53, and UMX-7.1. Some strains are characterized by significant cardiac hypertrophy, some by ventricular dilation without hypertrophy, and still other strains show compensatory hypertrophy progressing to left ventricular dilation (Cruz et al., 2007, Goineau et al., 2001, Homburger, 1979, Ikeda and Ross, 2000, Sakamoto et al., 1997).",

Hamsters serve as experimental models of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (McElroy et al., 2004, Milazzo et al., 2002, Wahl-Jensen et al., 2007). Hamsters are also susceptible to the coronovirus that leads to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, they are also useful for efficacy studies for vaccinations and immunotherapy treatments against this virus (Roberts et al., 2005). Hamsters are susceptible to fungal infections, including Histoplasma spp., and are sensitive to small inocula. They then can be involved in refinements for disease diagnosis. Most of the fungi grow in the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. Hamsters infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are used as models of localized infection in the respiratory tract (Brunner, 1997).",

In addition, hamsters can serve as models of leprosy, atypical tuberculosis, and leptospirosis, as well as other protozoal and helminthic infections. Leishmania infantum infection causes polymyositis and may be a new model for inflammatory myopathy (Paciello et al., 2010). Syrian hamsters have historically been valuable for the study of prion disease. Laboratory mice are now the animal model of choice for this research area, yet hamster strains are still occasionally used in the study of prions because of their susceptibility to scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, and Gerstmann\u2013Staussler syndrome (GSS) (Lowenstein et al., 1990). These prions cause slow, progressive, degenerative diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). Hamsters develop amyloid-like deposits in their brains, which may be similar to extracellular deposits of amyloid found in human Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Czub et al., 1986). Scrapie prions replicate to high titers in the brains of several species of hamsters, making it possible to compare the human and hamster forms of the disease in a single host (Lowenstein et al., 1990, Marsh and Hanson, 1978). Further information about the prion diseases can be obtained in reviews by Prusiner, 1991, Trevitt and Collinge, 2006.",

Since that time, one of the main uses of Syrian hamsters in the biomedical setting has been to aid in the assessment of human fertility using the zona-free hamster oocyte assay, which analyzes the ability of sperm to capacitate eggs, undergo the acrosome reaction, and fuse with the oocyte (Barros et al., 1978). Results obtained from the assay correlate well with human in vitro fertilization results, but the process is labor-intensive and difficult to standardize. As new techniques are developed to assess male fertility (such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection), the hamster oocyte assay has begun to wane in popularity (Aitken, 2006).",

It is of interest to note that the average life span of the female golden hamster may be markedly shorter than that of males, depending on strain and source of the animals (Bernfeld et al., 1986). The short life cycle of the Syrian hamster, ranging between 18 and 24 months, makes it an excellent animal for the study of development and the effect of teratogenic agents. The eighth day of pregnancy is the optimal time for teratogenic studies, when hourly development of the fetal pups can be observed (Ferm, 1967). Normative physiological data, such as heart rate and respiration, can be found in Table 5.1\n. Serum blood chemistry values have been provided in Table 5.2\n.

Often these highly distensible pouches are used by the hamster for temporary storage of food and bedding materials. These pouches do not contain glands but are rich in mast cells, are highly vascular, and lined with stratified squamous epithelium (deArruda and Montenegro, 1995). Blood supply to the pouches is carried by branches from the external carotid artery (Davis et al., 1986). More specifically, the pouches are supplied by six small arteries in the neck and face that are potentially important in controlling cheek pouch blood flow (Davis et al., 1986). The pouches can easily be everted (Fig. 5.1\n), with their blood flow intact, and have been used extensively for microvascular studies of inflammation, tumor growth, vascular smooth muscle function, and ischemia reperfusion studies (Svensjo, 1990, Hedqvist et al., 1990, Bertuglia and Reiter, 2007). These pouches lack an intact lymphatic drainage pathway and are therefore described as \u2018immunologically privileged.\u2019 Studies have shown that the surface density of Langerhans cells in the cheek pouches is markedly decreased, which may contribute to the specialized immune status of the tissue (Bergstresser et al., 1980). The pouch tissue will support the long-term survival of transplanted foreign tissue without immunological rejection. As mentioned previously, the Syrian hamster model of carcinogenesis in the cheek pouch is one of the best animal systems for the evaluation of human oral cancer development (Gimenez-Conti and Slaga, 1993).",

The presence or absence of vitamins in the diet is also thought to be a contributing factor (Shklar, 1972). Historical reports have suggested that caries may be caused by infectious bacteria and transmissible among rodents via oral routes (Jordan and van Houte, 1972).

Unlike the European hamster, which is a true hibernator, the Syrian hamster is not used extensively for hibernation studies since it may not reliably enter hibernation when exposed to cold temperatures and bouts of hibernation may be short (Lyman, 1982).

For hamsters, unlike other rodents, soybean meal offers better nutritional efficiency than fish meal. Carbohydrates in the diet can induce changes in both the glucose and lipid metabolism in hamsters (Kasim-Karakas et al., 1996). The mineral requirements for zinc, copper, and potassium are increased in the Syrian hamster, although the levels of other minerals are similar to those of the rat (Newberne and McConnell, 1979). Syrian hamsters require sources of many of the B vitamins and also need a source of non-nutritive bulk (Warner and Ehle, 1976). Vitamin E has been reported as essential for preventing myocytolysis in cardiomyopathic hamsters; deficiencies in this vitamin, combined with oxidative stress, may play a role in the pathogenesis of heart disease in hamsters (Sakanashi et al., 1991). In addition, vitamin E can reduce fatty streak accumulation in hypercholesterolemic hamsters (Xu et al., 1998).",

If food hoppers are used for hamsters, the feed pellets must be able to fall through the slots to the floor of the cage (Harkness et al., 1977). In a hamster study that began with observations of failing health, decreased conception, and increased cannibalism, the problems were traced to a change in feeders. The feeders that contributed to these problems had 5/16-inch-wide slots that prevented the food from dropping to the cage floor. Because hamsters have a broad muzzle, the animals were forced to bite the food simultaneously from both sides of the individual metal strips of the feeder. The situation resulted in broken teeth and severe weight loss due to starvation.",

For both genders, the ability to reproduce decreases at approximately 14 months of age. However, senescent females can often be successfully bred with younger males, even though there is a notable increase in defective ova and a decrease in number of offspring produced (Slater, 1972). The female has a 4-day estrous cycle that can be assessed by evaluation of the vaginal discharge. The end of ovulation (usually day 2 of the cycle) is marked by the appearance of a copious postovulatory discharge that fills the vagina and may extrude through the vaginal orifice. The discharge is creamy white, opaque, and very viscous, with a distinct odor. The female can be successfully mated in the evening of the third day after this postovulatory discharge.",

If the female is ready for mating, she will quickly assume a position of lordosis with hindlegs spread and tail erect, and will maintain this position if the male exhibits interest. If mating does not occur within 5 min, or if the female is aggressive, she is removed and another female can be presented to the male. If copulation occurs, the pair can be left together until the following light cycle.

Another method is to approach the animal in much the same way, but grasp only the skin. With the loose skin bunched securely in the hand, the skin is taut over the thorax and abdomen. As the animal is lifted, the hand holding the hamster is rotated so that the hamster\u2019s body is supported (Fig. 5.6\n). An alternative to this method is to approach from the animal\u2019s head, so that the thumb and forefinger are gripping the base of the tail; as before, the loose skin is secured between the fingers and the palmar surface before lifting. Still another method is to approach from the head and enclose the entire body with one hand.

            "text": "Weanling hamsters are very susceptible to this disease, but become less susceptible by 6 weeks of age, and resistant to infection by 10 weeks of age (Jacoby and Johnson, 1981). The lesions observed in the ileum develop in two phases following the experimental transmission of the disease (Jacoby, 1978). The initial phase is characterized by hyperplasia, which begins as a focal lengthening of villi. Approximately 3 weeks following transmission, an inflammatory phase begins, associated with focal or segmental necrosis of crypt epithelium. The evolution of the lesions is closely associated with a particulate bacterial antigen that can be detected by immunoperoxidase staining or in situ hybridization in the cytoplasm of mucosal epithelial cells. It is not clear what mechanism is utilized by L. intracellularis to localize to the gastrointestinal tract; however, cellular receptors or factors in the microenvironment may be important (Cooper and Gebhart, 1998). The proposed model for entry into the crypt epithelial cells involves attachment of the bacteria to the microvillus brush border, ingestion by endocytosis, and release from vacuoles into the cytoplasm of the cell. Released bacteria may then multiply within the epithelial cells prior to cell rupture. Additional bacteria may then attach to neighboring epithelial cells and spread the infection more rapidly (Jasni et al., 1994). Serum antibodies have been detected that are specific for the intracytoplasmic antigen, which may be of diagnostic value (Stills, 1991). Commercially available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are readily available for detection of L. intracellularis in fecal samples (Cooper et al., 1997b, Jones et al., 1993).",

            "text": "This condition was first reported in Japanese Waltzing mice but has since been diagnosed in several other species including rats, rabbits, gerbils, cats, rhesus monkeys, dogs, horses, guinea pigs, and hamsters (Ganaway et al., 1971, Waggie et al., 1987). The disease is caused by Clostridium piliforme, a spore-forming intracellular bacterium. Transmission is believed to occur through the oral ingestion of C. piliforme spores from the feces of infected animals (Waggie et al., 1987). Although Tyzzer\u2019s disease has only been sporadically reported in hamsters, transmission to hamsters is a possibility whenever hamsters are housed near susceptible species (Frisk, 2012). Clinical signs include roughened hair coats, diarrhea, and high mortality in animals that tend to be of weaning age or immunosuppressed (Donnelly, 1997). Reported necropsy lesions include enterocolitis, lymphadenitis, and multifocal necrotizing hepatitis (Fig. 5.9\n) (Nakayama et al., 1975). The diagnosis depends on the demonstration of the characteristic organism in the affected tissue, particularly in the epithelial and smooth muscle cells of the ileum, cecum, and colon, following special staining with Giemsa or silver techniques (Waggie et al., 1987). In experimental infections, inflammatory lesions may be present within 2 days of inoculation, while foci of liver necrosis occur within 4 days (Waggie et al., 1987). Infection with C. piliforme may not always manifest into clinical disease in the hamster. Outbreaks may have lesions localized in the intestines, the liver, or primarily in cardiac muscle, with or without intestinal involvement (Nakayama et al., 1976, Magaribuchi et al., 1977, Zook et al., 1977). The most important factors in the control and prevention of Tyzzer\u2019s disease involve improved sanitation and isolation, since elimination of C. piliforme spores is critical for containing an outbreak. Treatment is not usually described in reported outbreaks. Oxytetracycline was added to the water of a pet store supplier of hamsters with an outbreak without success (Motzel and Gibson, 1990).\n",

Antibiotics associated with enterocolitis in hamsters include lincomycin, clindamycin, ampicillin, vancomy\u00adcin, erythromycin, cephalosporins, gentamicin, and penicillin (Percy and Barthold, 2007); C. difficile overgrowth subsequently occurs and can cause enterocolitis due to alterations to intestinal microflora (Frisk, 2012). C. difficile can also cause disease in hamsters unrelated to antibiotic use. Hamsters may unexpectedly die with or without signs of diarrhea and have lesions of cecitis. Affected hamsters may vary in age from juveniles to adults (Hart et al., 2010). It is postulated that cecal dysbiosis results in cecal hyperplasia, overgrowth of the bacteria, and resultant necrotizing cecitis (Fig. 5.10\n) (Ryden et al., 1991). A reported outbreak with toxigenic, cytotoxin B-positive C. difficile resulted in profuse, watery, and hemorrhagic diarrhea that was highly associated with mortality (Chang and Rohwer, 1991). Histologic findings included typhlitis and colitis in these adult hamsters.",

The development of antibodies against the virulence factors, toxins A and B, has proved useful in preventing disease relapse and subsequent reinfections in hamsters (Kink and Williams, 1998).

Preventive procedures, should salmonellosis be suspected, should include the isolation of hamsters from other rodents and quality control procedures to preclude the introduction of contaminated food or bedding.

            "text": "\nHelicobacter spp. are motile gram-negative bacteria that are curved to spiral to fusiform in morphology. The hamster intestine is naturally colonized with several Helicobacter spp. that are not typically associated with clinical disease. Species identified in the hamster include H. cinaedi, H. mesocricetorum, H. cholecystus, H. aurati, and a novel Helicobacter species (in the H. bilis cluster) (Fox et al., 2009, Patterson et al., 2000a, Patterson et al., 2000b, Whary and Fox, 2004). H. cinaedi has been isolated from the intestinal tract of hamsters and has not been shown to cause pathological changes in this species (Gebhart et al., 1989). However, it has been shown to cause enteritis, proctocolitis, and rectal infection in humans (Gebhart et al., 1989, Whary and Fox, 2004). Hamsters should be considered a potential source of infection in humans, especially immonocompromised individuals (Fox, 2002). H. mesocricetorum has been isolated from the feces of hamsters and is considered a nonpathological commensal of the intestine (Simmons et al., 2000). Its causal association with pancreatic lesions has not been established. H. cholecystus has been isolated from hamsters with cholangiofibrosis and centrilobular pancreatitis in hamsters (Franklin et al., 1996). H. aurati has been associated with several experimentally induced lesions. Syrian hamsters infected with H. aurati had gastritis, chronic and progressive typhlocolitis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplastic lesions in the large intestine (Patterson et al., 2000a, Patterson et al., 2000b). Hamsters showed either no clinical signs or chronic weight loss/poor body condition. Helicobacter spp. were also isolated from a hamster with gastric adenocarcinoma (Nambier et al., 2006; Patterson et al., 2000a, Patterson et al., 2000b). A novel Helicobacter species was identified, from the livers of aged hamsters, that appears closely related to H. bilis and may play a role in hepatobiliary disease: the livers from those hamsters had lesions of chronic hepatitis, hepatic dysplasia, and biliary hyperplasia (Fox et al., 2009).",

Clinical signs may vary depending on whether the LCMV infection is natural or experimentally induced. In adult hamsters, natural infection generally causes an acute short-term infection that rarely causes illness. Infections in perinatally exposed animals remain subclinical, despite the fact that hamsters are shedding large amounts of virus during this period. Approximately half of hamsters infected congenitally or as newborns remain persistently infected and may develop chronic, progressive fatal disease characterized by inactivity, weight loss and wasting (Skinner and Knight, 1979). Impaired reproductive performance has been reported for chronically infected female hamsters (Parker et al., 1976).",

Mice can be naturally infected with two strains, MADV strain FL (now known as MAdV A) and K87 (now known as MAdV B). Hamsters can be serologically positive for antibodies to MAdV A, although reports of adenoviral infections are sporadic (Suzuki et al., 1982). Naturally occurring enteric adenovirus infection in hamsters, closely resembling infection with MAdVB in mice, is not associated with clinical disease and affects animals less than 24 days of age (Gibson et al., 1990).

            "text": "The exact origin of HaPyV has not been elucidated. The virus has been isolated from the spleen and kidney of subclinically infected European hamsters, suggesting them as the natural host, with infection transferred to Syrian hamsters inadvertently after species co-mingling (Hannoun et al., 1974, Percy and Barthold, 2007). The virus is likely transmitted horizontally via ingestion of virions or through contaminated fomites (Ambrose and Coggin, 1975, Coggin et al., 1983). HaPyV is unusual in that it displays tropism for both undifferentiated keratinocytes and also lymphocytes. Due to this variable tissue tropism, it may cause two different disease syndromes. The syndrome observed in an individual hamster depends upon the immunological status of the animal and the age of the hamster when infected. One syndrome occurs in naive juvenile hamsters that manifests as an epizootic multicentric lymphoma involving the mesentery, intestines, liver, kidney, and thymus (Barthold et al., 1987, Graffi et al., 1969, Simmons et al., 2001). Lymphoma may also be induced by injection of virus or viral DNA (Barthold et al., 1987, Graffi et al., 1969, Graffi et al., 1970). With the second disease syndrome, hamsters develop trichoepitheliomas on the face, feet, neck, back, flanks, and abdomen. These tumors typically develop in hamsters aged 3 months to 1 year (Coggin et al., 1985, Graffi et al., 1970, Scherneck and Feunteun, 1990). Simultaneous formation of both epitheloimas and lymphomas in a single hamster rarely happens (Barthold et al., 1987). Virus likely persists in the renal tubular epithelium and is shed in urine. Additionally, virus-containing shed keratinocytes or enterocytes released in the feces can be a source of infection (Simmons et al., 2001).",

Mice have been known to transmit Syphacia obvelata to Syrian hamsters (Watson, 1946), and Syrian hamsters can become infected with S. muris, the rat oxyurid, as a consequence of direct contact with infected rats (Ross et al., 1980). Eradication has been reported by two treatment courses with piperazine citrate (10 mg/ml of drinking water) for 7 days separated by 5 days without treatment (Unay and Davis, 1980). Treatment strategies for mice and rats are well documented, with avermectins and benzimidazoles being the most widely used anthelmintics for pinworm eradication (Pritchett, 2007, Pritchett and Johnston, 2002). Studies detailing treatment strategies in hamsters are limited, but treatment can most likely be adapted from the treatment of other rodents. The pinworm life cycle is direct, and transmission occurs through direct contact and fomites such as dirty cages and bedding material (Wightman et al., 1978).",

Although some reports state that hamsters have a low incidence of naturally occurring tumors, other groups have found the occurrence of spontaneous tumors to be quite high (Homburger, 1983, Pour et al., 1976a). For example, the overall incidence of spontaneous malignant neoplasms in Syrian hamsters has been estimated to be 3.7%, based on 435 tumors found in 11,972 animals (Van Hoosier and Trentin, 1979). Tanaka et al. (1991) reported tumor incidences in male hamsters of 10.6% and 11.5% in two cohorts, and Pour et al., 1976a, Pour et al., 1976b, Pour et al., 1976c noted an overall incidence of 32% in one colony versus 42% in another. Factors affecting the difference in numbers of tumors reported include the strain, age, and sex distribution of the animals observed; the environmental conditions and source of the colony (i.e., genetic differences between colonies); and the extent to which the animals are examined grossly and microscopically. There is general consensus that tumors occur more frequently in females than in males (Pour et al., 1976a, Van Hoosier and Trentin, 1979).",

            "text": "Amyloidosis, a disease in which normally soluble proteins polymerize as insoluble fibrils, is a principal cause of death in hamsters on long-term experiments. The two components of amyloid are amyloid A (AA), which is derived from amyloid fibrils, and amyloid P (AP), also known as \u2018female protein\u2019 (FP), a member of the pantraxin family of plasma proteins (Tennent et al., 1993). Studies have shown that sex hormones regulate the expression of AP and that levels in females are normally 100- to 200-fold greater than levels in males (Coe et al., 1981). When compared to males, female Syrian hamsters have a distinct predisposition to acquire amyloidosis, with increased severity and earlier onset. Organs involved typically include the liver, kidney, stomach, adrenal, thyroid, and spleen (Coe and Ross, 1990). Testosterone has been linked to the inhibition of hepatic synthesis of AP, which is the homolog of primary importance in the deposition of amyloid (Coe and Ross, 1990). The incidence of nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis was reported to be 6% in a colony of Syrian hamsters, with ascites and anasarca observed (Murphy et al., 1984). Affected hamsters can present with extensive subcutaneous edema, ascites and hydrothorax (Fig. 5.11\n). The primary gross lesions are pale tan, enlarged, and misshapen kidneys (Fig. 5.12\n). Serum albumin is decreased and the total globulin component is increased in hamsters over 1 year of age. Proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia, triglyceridemia, and high levels of creatinine have been reported (Murphy et al., 1984). Clinical signs and laboratory test findings of low albumin, ascites, and proteinuria are classic for a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, as described in humans. Histologically, characteristic amyloid deposits are present initially in the glomeruli of the kidney and subsequently in a variety of tissues. Because amyloidosis in mice is strain-associated, genetic factors should be considered in the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease in hamsters. Amyloidosis in the Syrian hamster is used as a model to understand the pathogenesis of the same disease in humans, including the form linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Coe et al., 1997). Amylodosis can be induced experimentally using casein or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) subcutaneous injections (Hol et al., 1986, Niewold et al., 1987).",

The liver is a common site, but several organs may be affected, including the cecum, kidneys, ovaries, and spleen (Table 5.3\n). The liver lesions are related to developmental defects of normal ductal structures (i.e., bile ducts), whereas cysts in other organs likely develop from dilations of the lymphatic system. The condition may be associated with distension of the abdomen, but other clinical signs have not been recorded. Typical findings include cysts of variable size that can be unilocular to multilocular (Kaup et al., 1990). At necropsy, the cysts are thin-walled with clear watery fluid varying in color from amber to green. Findings in one study mentioned that the proteinaceous nature of the fluid resulted in white solidified collections within cysts in the cecal walls (Kaup et al., 1990). Reports have found that a higher incidence of intraperitoneal cysts occurs in European compared to Syrian hamsters (Kaup et al., 1990).",

The exact incidence varies greatly, from 16% reported in one colony to 73% incidence in another (McMartin, 1977; Pour, 1976a). Males and females are equally affected, but females develop the condition at an earlier age. Atrial thrombosis may be most commonly seen in the APA strain of hamster, accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy that develops with age (Doi et al., 1987). Clinical signs are suggestive of heart failure and include tachypnea, tachycardia, and cyanosis (Sichuk et al., 1965). Upon necropsy, thrombi are present, primarily in the left atrium. One study also noted that there was bilateral ventricular hypertrophy in the hearts with thrombosis and myxomatous thickening of the atrioventricular valves. However, the valvular lesions were also found in all aged hamsters, regardless of whether thrombi were present or not (McMartin and Dodds, 1982). Doi et al. (1987) propose that an increase in relative and absolute heart weights seen in older APA hamsters is suggestive of cardiac hypertrophy. It is postulated that thrombi occur as a result of local blood stasis, secondary to heart failure (McMartin and Dodds, 1982).",

Today, use of this animal in research is greatly overshadowed by the extensive use of cell lines derived from its ovarian cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are used almost exclusively for cell culturing experiments to obtain heterologous protein products (Oka and Rupp, 1990).

These hamsters tend to be very aggressive, are easily frightened and will attack and bite. Those in captivity through laboratory breeding have become much easier to handle. Each litter develops a defined social order, with the heaviest male being dominant (Reznik-Schuller et al., 1974). The average life span of a research-bred European hamster is 34 months for females and 31 months for males, which may be related to the higher reported incidence of neoplasia in males (Ernst et al., 1989).

Thymomas discovered in a small number of examined European hamsters resembled benign human thymomas (Ghadially and Illman, 1965). Thymic tumors were associated with large numbers of mast cells, which are not normally seen in the human form of disease (Ghadially and Illman, 1965). Similar to the Syrian and Chinese hamsters, the European hamster has a very low incidence of spontaneous pulmonary neoplasia (Ernst et al., 1989). In a small group of males (n=8), animals were found to be generally free of endoparasites, ectoparasites, and blood parasites (Silverman and Chavannes, 1977).

            "text": "The Djungarian hamsters are Phodopus campbelli (Russian dwarf) and P. sungorus (Siberian dwarf) (Fig. 5.15\n). Initially these animals were assumed to be subspecies; however, they are now believed to be separate species. The two may be confused because the common name \u2018Djungarian\u2019 is often used to denote either species. The most obvious factor to phenotypically differentiate P. campbelli from P. sungorus is the lack of dramatic coat color change in response to a short photoperiod: P. sungorus molts to a pure white haircoat, while P. campbelli retains its gray haircoat. Karyotype analysis using G-banding and chromosomal painting with probes from the Syrian and Chinese hamsters has confirmed close phylogenetic relationship between P. sungorus and P. campbelli (Romanenko et al., 2007). Unique C-banding patterns in P. sungorus chromosomes distinguish the karyotype from that of P. campbelli (Ross, 1998). The Russian dwarf hamster has been traced to Siberia, China, and Mongolia and is a distant relative of the Syrian hamster (Cooper et al., 1991). The Siberian dwarf hamster is native to the steppes of Kazakhstan, Manchuria, and northern China (Wynne-Edwards and Lisk, 1984). These hamsters range from 50 to 100 mm in body length, with an additional 10 mm of tail. Body weights range from 18 to 25 g, with mature males reaching 40\u201350 g. The dorsal fur is gray, and a dark stripe runs dorsally along the length of the body. The fur of the ventrum, limbs, and tail tends to be white. Djungarian hamsters generally live for 9\u201315 months, although survival up to 2 years has been reported (Lawrie and Megahy, 1991). The normal karyotype of the Djungarian species is 2n = 28 chromosomes. These hamsters have a high incidence of neoplasia and are susceptible to carcinogens, and can be infected with oncogenic viruses, particularly Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), Human mastadenovirus A (formerly known as human adenovirus 12), and SV40 (Pogosianz, 1975). The dwarf hamsters are extensively used in behavior and reproductive physiology studies.",

            "text": "Dwarf hamsters have the most compressed reproductive cycle of any eutherian mammal. They can mate on the day of parturition (following an 18-day gestation) and deliver the second litter, while weaning the first, within a 36-day time period (Newkirk et al., 1997). Similar to the Syrian and Chinese hamsters, the two Djungarian hamster species have a 4-day estrus cycle with spontaneous ovulation (Erb et al., 1993). Pregnancy in Phodopus campbelli is dependent on continued secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum through late gestation (Edwards et al., 1995). Prolactin levels in this species are absent during midgestation and resume in late gestation. Possible roles for this reappearance of activity include influences on lactogenesis, mammary gland development, and the regulation of maternal behavior toward newborns (Edwards et al., 1995). Successful reproduction in P. campbelli is dependent on monogamous parental care by both males and females (Wynne-Edwards and Lisk, 1984, Wynne-Edwards and Lisk, 1987). In contrast, male P. sungorus do not participate in the rearing of offspring. The nonaggressive behavior of females facilitates the maintenance of breeding pairs throughout life, with weaning of offspring occurring at 3 weeks of age. Females can bear between one and 18 litters, with each consisting of one to nine pups, in their reproductive years (Pogosianz, 1975). Reproductive development in females is accelerated when exposed to males of the same species (Reasner and Johnston, 1988). Increased food hoarding has been observed in P. sungorus as a behavioral adaptation to provide accessible energy during pregnancy (Bartness, 1997). Endocrinology in P. sungorus is similar to that of other rodent species, yet differs from that of P. campbelli. This implies that the two species of Djungarian hamsters have undergone evolutionary selection pressures with respect to reproductive endocrinology (Mcmillan and Wynne-Edwards, 1998). As adults, these hamsters are biologically dependent on the critical photoperiod, which is approximately 13 h (versus 12.5 h in the Syrian and 15.5 h in the European hamsters) (Pevet, 1988). Changes in photoperiod influence seasonal changes in breeding activities, thermoregulation, hair-coat growth, and fat metabolism (Pogosianz, 1975, Ebling, 1994). Djungarian hamsters have been widely used in studies of the pineal gland and melatonin secretion in mediating the effects of photoperiod. These hamsters are unusual in that they do not hibernate even when exposed to temperatures below \u2212 40\u00b0C (Schlenker, 1985). Seasonal acclimation of blood-gas transport during periods of colder temperatures is facilitated by an increased relative heart weight, increased surface area of erythrocytes, and slightly altered hemoglobin content, all of which aid in oxygen transport (Puchalski and Heldmaier, 1986). These animals also decrease their resting metabolic rates and increase their capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis to adapt to inclement temperatures (Schlenker, 1985).",

The incidence of the tumors has changed over time, with mammary tumors increasing and skin tumors decreasing in frequency; this may reflect genetic alterations linked to further inbreeding (Pogosianz and Sokova, 1982). Affected dwarf hamsters are reported to exhibit rapid weight loss, similar to that seen with disease conditions of bronchopneumonia and incisor malocclusion. Dermatologic conditions of trichophytosis have been reported (Pogosianz, 1975). Other skin problems include alopecia and ventral dermatitis caused by demodectic mites.",
