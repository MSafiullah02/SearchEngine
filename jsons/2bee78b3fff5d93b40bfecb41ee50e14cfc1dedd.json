            "text": "The Sars-CoV-2 epidemic will be over only when the level of immunity in the 32 population reaches a level where the effective reproduction number falls below 1 through 33 natural immunity or vaccination. It is expected to be at least a year before an effective 34 vaccine can be developed and tested adequately. On 23 March 2020 stringent social 35 distancing measures (termed lockdown) were imposed in the UK so as to prevent the 36 epidemic from overwhelming the National Health Service and to reduce immediate 37 impact on deaths. Modelling studies for the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on 38 Modelling (SPI-M) have suggested that an adaptive strategy \"alternating between 39 periods of more and less strict social distancing measures\" may be needed to keep the 40 number of critical care cases within capacity until the epidemic ends [1] . Concern about 41 the economic and social costs of this intermittent lockdown strategy has motivated 42 exploration of other approaches for managing the epidemic from this point forward. 43 One suggested strategy for exit from the lockdown has been to undertake weekly 44 testing of the entire population for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, followed by isolation of those 45 who test positive and their contacts until the epidemic is suppressed [2] . Another option 46 that has been tentatively proposed is to shield those at high risk while allowing 47 immunity to build up in those at low risk [3] . A a briefing dated 26 February from the 48 Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE) alluded to this \"stratify-and-shield\" 49 approach [4] : 50 An additional strategy would be to apply more intense measures on those age 51 or risk groups at most risk of experiencing severe disease (e.g. household 52 isolation of those over 65, special measures around care homes). The has not looked at the likely feasibility or effectiveness of such methods. 56 In subsequent modelling studies for SPI-M, interventions including less stringent 57 \"social distancing\" of those over 70 years of age were assessed based on assuming modest 58 reductions in contacts with people outside the household but no reduction in household 59 contacts [5] . The models predicted that although this partial shielding would be one of 60 the most effective measures in reducing total deaths and severe outcomes, under the 61 assumption of an infection fatality ratio of 0.9% it would not be enough to prevent 62 critical care facilities from being overwhelmed. 63 A key objective of the emerging discipline of \"precision medicine\" is to use risk 64 stratification to assist clinical decision making. This has driven forward methodological 65 developments for instance in privacy-preserving analysis of information from medical 66 records, and quantifying increments in predictive performance in ways that are relevant 67 to decisions. As researchers in this field we have examined how risk stratification, based 68 on using information from medical records to quantify risk of severe or fatal COVID-19, 69 might lay the basis for a stratify-and-shield policy. We do not advocate a particular 70 course of action but instead investigate the theoretical dependencies of the 71 stratify-and-shield approach, its possible impact on mortality and workload for the 72 health service, and discuss how to resolve some of the key uncertainties upon which the 73 effectiveness of such an approach depends. ratio. The classifier is applied to the susceptible population, considered as a mixture of 84 \"cases\" (individuals who are destined to die if unshielded during the epidemic) and 85 \"non-cases\" (individuals who are destined to survive if unshielded during the epidemic). 86 Those at high risk are allocated to shielding until the epidemic among unshielded 87 individuals is over, by which time the proportion of unshielded survivors who are 88 immune has reached I u . We assume conservatively that by this time all unshielded 89 individuals who were destined to die if unshielded have died.",

For each individual, such a classifier will 104 output the log-likelihood ratio (weight of evidence) favouring case over non-case status. 105 To predict how such a classifier will behave when used for risk stratification, we can use 106 the properties of the class-conditional sampling distributions of the weight of evidence 107 favouring assignment to one class over the other. These distributions are constrained by 108 mathematical consistency to have regularity properties [6] . The expectation of the 109 weight of evidence favouring the correct over the incorrect class assignment is the 110 expected information for discrimination conveyed by the classifier, denoted by the 111 symbol \u039b [7] . A key advantage of using \u039b, rather than the familiar C-statistic (area 112 under the receiver operating characteristic curve) to quantify classifier performance is 113 that the contributions of independent predictors are additive on the scale of \u039b. We can 114 thus add the information for discrimination estimated from a case-control study 115 matched on age and sex to the information for discrimination calculated from age-and 116 sex-specific incidence rates.",

The odds ratio for death 173 associated with a ten-year increase in age was 3 and the odds ratio associated with male 174 sex was 2.1 The log-likelihood ratio favouring correct over incorrect assignment was 175 computed by subtracting the log prior odds from the log posterior adds. Taking the 176 average of this ratio (as the average of the mean in those who died and the mean in 177 those who survived) gives an estimate for the expected information for discrimination of 178 \u039b = 3 bits. This provides a lower bound on a range of plausible values for the 179 performance of a classifier that uses information from medical records in addition to age 180 and sex: from associations with pre-existing morbidity we might expect to obtain 181 between 0.5 and 1.5 bits of information for discrimination. 183 For each assumed pair of values for infection fatality ratio F and and initial proportion 184 susceptible S, and each value of \u039b, we calculated the threshold for sensitivity and 185 specificity that would set the the proportion of the population allocated to shielding to 186 0.15.

This implies that for every 10,000 deaths in the unshielded group, there will be 220 about 24000 individuals requiring critical care.

Additional cases would be expected in The adaptive social distancing policy is intended to limit the arrival rate of severe cases 232 to a level that is within the capacity of critical care services to manage, and also to limit 233 deaths by delaying infection until a vaccine is available [5] . As updates of the original 234 modelling studies based on the rather lower values of the infection fatality ratio that are 235 now considered plausible [12] have not been released, it is difficult to make direct 236 comparisons between projections based on the adaptive social distancing policy and 237 those based on the stratify-and-shield policy.

It does however require 343 that support for shielding is adequate to protect high-risk individuals from infection 344 while the epidemic in the unshielded group continues; if this support were implemented 345 in a half-hearted manner, the outcome for those who rely on social care would be poor. 346 Intense shielding is already recommended in UK guidance for more than 1 million 347 people who are \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" because they have received organ These individuals are advised to adopt rigorous shielding measures, including staying at 351 home at all times, isolating themselves from others in the same household and not going 352 out even for food or medicine.

This is the 252 maximum number of deaths that could have been prevented by a lockdown in 253 comparison to a stratify-and-shield policy. In this scenario, all males under age 60 and 254 females under age 70 would have been allocated to the unshielded group. We can 255 calculate an upper bound on the average years of life lost by those in this group who 256 would have died as 27.3 years based on the (implausible) assumption that males under 257 age 60 and females under age 70 who died with COVID-19 in England and Wales had 258 the same life expectancy as those in the general population with the same age-sex 259 distribution. We can use this to calculate a lower bound on the cost-effectiveness of the 260 lockdown in comparison to stratify-and-shield as \u00a3114,000 per year of life gained under 261",
