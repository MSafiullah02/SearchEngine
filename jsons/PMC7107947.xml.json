Notably, destinations include many low- and middle-income plus a few high-income countries. Patients often seek treatment in their World Health Organization (WHO) region of residence, but the diaspora population may combine medical treatment with family visits [8]. Seventy percent of patients going to Singapore and Malaysia are from countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; those going to Cuba are mainly from the Caribbean and Central America, and those going to Jordan are mostly from Middle Eastern countries [8]. The main constraint on medical tourism is the challenge of insurance portability. High-quality medical professionals, often trained in the United States or United Kingdom, are found in many institutions treating medical tourists; US medical schools are increasingly cooperating with foreign institutions in educational efforts. Meanwhile, lower costs of services, including labor, provide developing countries a substantial cost advantage [8].",

Widely variable estimates of global medical tourism value (US$20\u2013$60 billion) are unreliable [10].

Common procedures include dental work; arthroplasty; cataract, bariatric, cosmetic, and cardiac surgery; reproductive care; and tissue and organ transplant. More than 40% of unrelated stem cell transplants worldwide involve donors from a different country [15]. Vast cost differences exist: a hip replacement may cost $7000\u2013$12 000 (India) or $6500\u2013$14 000 (Thailand) versus $43 000\u2013100 000 (United States) [12].

Travelers cultured before, during, and after travel to Mexico showed increase in resistance in their fecal Escherichia coli, even if they took no antibiotics [38]. In a Canadian study, patients with diarrhea who had recently traveled had a 5.2-fold increase in colonization with ESBL-producing E. coli [39]. Twenty-four of 100 Swedish travelers acquired new ESBL-producing E. coli during travel (median duration, 2 weeks), with highest rates from India (7 of 8 travelers) [40]. The ESBL colonization rate in Australians increased from 7.8% pretravel to 49% posttravel, with resistant E. coli isolated from 50% to 79% of travelers to Asia (excluding Japan), South America, and/or Middle East/Africa [41]. At 6 months posttravel, 18%\u201324% remained colonized [40, 41]. Resistance enzymes varied by region: CTX-M-15 from India, Europe, and Africa, and CTX-M-14 from elsewhere in Asia [42]. CTX-M \u03b2-lactamases carried in feces also spread within households [43]. A UK study found that recent international travel or antibiotic use were independent risk factors for septicemia following transrectal prostate biopsy. All blood and urine E. coli isolates from septic patients were resistant to ciprofloxacin, the agent used for prophylaxis [44].

This metallo-\u03b2-lactamase was first characterized from an isolate in a Swedish patient (Indian origin) who had been hospitalized in India in late 2007 and early 2008 [52]. In Sweden, a multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae from his urine and an E. coli cultured from a fecal sample were both positive for what was subsequently designated NDM. These carbapenemases have been identified primarily in Enterobacteriaceae but can spread to multiple gram-negative bacterial species, including other pathogens (eg, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella), and to commensals. Bacteria may carry NDM-1 along with other resistance determinants; they are typically pan-resistant. The genetic element encoding NDM-1 is carried on plasmids and occasionally on chromosomes [53]. A 2010 paper identified 37 NDM-1\u2013producing isolates in the United Kingdom, a high proportion in travelers to India or Pakistan within the previous year (n = 17/37); 14 had antecedent hospital treatment abroad, including renal or bone marrow transplant and cosmetic surgery [46]. The earliest documented NDM-1\u2013producing isolates were in India in 2006 [54]. NDM-1\u2013producing isolates are widespread in clinical isolates in India and Pakistan (Varanasi 6.9%, Mumbai 8%, and Rawalpindi, 18.5%), [54\u201356] and were also found in environmental samples (eg, water samples, Delhi) [57].

The public should be informed of potential infectious disease risks associated with overseas hospital care.

For medical tourists, a tracking system is needed as patients from one institution may return to many different countries and institutions, making it difficult to identify problems at a particular institution. Improved communication is essential to optimize continuity of care of medical tourists who may have follow-up on a different continent by a clinical team unaware of site(s) of medical and surgical care. Medical tourists may carry home unusually resistant microbial flora; patients hospitalized after return from medical care in high-risk destinations such as South Asia should be placed on contact isolation and cultured for resistant organisms. Decisions about empiric therapy and surgical prophylaxis should consider recent travel history and procedures abroad. Surveillance networks such as GeoSentinel (55 travel\u2013tropical medicine clinics on 6 continents) can be refined to capture data on antimicrobial resistance. The International Health Regulations 2005 contain criteria to determine whether an event may \u201cconstitute a public health emergency of international concern\u201d [64]; thus, WHO can potentially champion coordinated global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance as well as international response [65].",

Knowledge of this trend is critical in incorporating a global perspective into clinical care. Patients may not freely volunteer information about medical care, so today's medical history must include explicit queries about travel and details of medical care or procedures carried out abroad. The differential diagnosis of illness after a procedure in another country is often broader than that in the United States. Infection control issues must be considered, as patients may be colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Complicating infections may appear early or late, with the latter more common in those who have received blood or blood products, tissue or organ transplants, and immunosuppressed hosts. Healthcare abroad is an integral part of the knowledge base required of infectious disease clinicians. More generally, a better system is needed to gather information on these global patients and the outcomes of their treatment. Infectious diseases associated with medical tourism have been recognized primarily through case reports or case series. Collection of data including demographics, procedures sought, and outcomes in a systematic and standardized fashion is needed to inform physicians caring for patients seeking medical care abroad or returning from their overseas medical treatments. Policy makers must consider economic, ethical, and legal aspects of medical tourism in trying to balance healthcare access and affordability.",
