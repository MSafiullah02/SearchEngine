Conventional typing methods, such as phage typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), have been used successfully to describe the global population structure of S. aureus, to provide a framework for the description of the major lineages associated with healthcare-associated infections in different countries and to monitor their emergence, dispersal and decline in different settings. However, conventional typing methods have serious limitations when used to investigate the finer details of infection outbreaks.1 Conventional methods are often insufficiently discriminatory to \u2018rule out\u2019 suspected transmission events in the absence of additional epidemiological information, since representatives of the same type are often found all around the world. For example, when investigating a cluster of MRSA cases in a healthcare setting where a particular MRSA strain has become endemic, conventional methods would most likely fail to distinguish between those unlinked cases that happen to belong to the same lineage and other cases that are truly connected via recent transmission. Conversely, when the typing method depends on phenotypic characterization such as antibiotic susceptibility profiles, isolates that are truly linked via transmission events might not be recognized as such because the characteristics they measure are encoded on mobile genetic elements.2, 3\n",

By comparing the relatedness of two isolates with the resolution offered by whole genome sequences, and using estimates of the genome's mutation rate, it is possible to estimate the time elapsed since their descent from a common ancestor with precision.4 Combined with epidemiological data, such as information on dates of admission to hospital, it is then possible to draw inferences about the probability that a transmission event occurred or not, with sufficient accuracy to direct better targeting of infection control resources.5 In fact, refinements in genealogical approaches to sequence data analysis offer the prospect of being able to make such inferences even in the absence of supporting epidemiological information (X.

Sequence data interpreted in the context of epidemiological surveillance data will allow the rapid detection of new emerging strains. At a local level awareness of patterns of transmission and prompt outbreak recognition (as early as the detection of the first secondary case) will permit more effective interventions to be instigated. At an individual patient level, the genetic basis for phenotypic characteristics of relevance to clinical case management, such as antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors, may also be determined using the same method. However, there remain major hurdles to be overcome to translate WGS from a research tool into clinical practice. These include cost, turnaround time and bioinformatic analysis. Current rates of progress suggest that most of these difficulties should be overcome in the fairly near future.",

MLST is based on sequence variation in housekeeping genes.23, 24 MLST classifies S. aureus strains into groups that reflect phylogeny, allowing the study of population structure and evolutionary history.13, 25, 26 Different MLST sequence types can be grouped into clonal complexes (CC) on the basis that they share some of the seven (or more) loci.27 By contrast, spa-typing is based on the highly variable X-region of a single gene (spa) that encodes protein A.28 Concordance between MLST and spa-typing is high so that spa-typing is now used widely for MRSA typing.29 In PFGE, enzymes are used to cleave DNA into fragments of different sizes which form strain-specific patterns when separated by gel electrophoresis.30 Compared with MLST and spa-typing, PFGE is relatively good at resolving differences between strains and many authors have promoted it as a tool for local outbreak investigation.31, 32 MLVA uses multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify known genetic loci containing varying length random repeats, which again are separated into strain-specific patterns by electrophoresis.33 MLVA has been shown to have powers of discrimination similar to those of PFGE, and MLVA results are highly concordant with those generated by MLST and spa-typing.33, 34, 35, 36, 37\n",

Each read represents the sequence of a small fraction of the genome. The reads overlap so that each position of the genome is included in several reads. This number is called \u2018the coverage\u2019. To be useful, the reads need to be assembled into the whole genome sequence. This can be done in one of two ways; either by comparison with a previously sequenced \u2018reference\u2019 strain (mapping-based assembly), or by piecing the reads together on the basis of their overlaps (de novo assembly).47, 48 Mapping-based assembly produces results that are easier to interpret, but are dependent upon the choice of reference genome, so that sequences not present in the reference genome remain unmapped. In principle, de novo assembly can recover the whole genome, but in practice it returns several assembled regions (called contigs) whose further assembly tends to remain unresolved. In either case, longer read lengths and higher coverage make assembly easier and more accurate.49 Storing the reads for a single S. aureus genome requires about 1 GB of storage space; roughly equivalent to 10 music albums in MP3 format. The term high-throughput sequencing is used to refer to newer sequencing technologies that can generate sequence data faster and more economically than previous platforms. Consequently, sequencing platforms are rated according to their throughput speeds, set-up and processing costs and length of reads produced.45 A medium-sized sequencing facility can process thousands of bacterial isolates in a year. New platforms (Oxford Nanopore and Ion Proton) offer the promise of projected cost reductions to the order of US $1,000 for a whole human genome, sequenced in 15 min to 2 h. Such performance would translate into sequencing costs for bacteria of about US $1 per whole genome.",

By comparing sequence data it is possible to infer phylogenetic relationships. A key requirement when interpreting such data is to be able to calibrate the molecular clock, i.e. estimate the rate at which mutations accumulate during the evolution of a genome. With knowledge of the molecular clock, it is possible directly to convert a number of differences between two genomes into the length of evolutionary time that has elapsed since they last shared a common ancestor. This is an area where there is still some uncertainty. The molecular clock may not tick at a constant speed in different settings (environment, commensal and in blood for example), in different hosts or even across lineages. Harris et al. used a linear regression between isolation dates and root-to-tip distances in a phylogenetic reconstruction to estimate an average rate of 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 mutations per site per year in S. aureus.53 Over the whole genome, this represents an average of 9.2 mutations per genome per year.

However, it seems reasonable to predict that bench-top sequencers will become increasingly accessible and user-friendly. A secure central database could be developed for exchange of data that would allow interpretation of sequence data within a given epidemiological context.

Using this method, they found evidence suggestive of hospital-based transmission of MRSA between patients staying in the same hospital in Thailand. Another research group used WGS to demonstrate the emergence in a localized hospital setting of a new MRSA clone within ST36 that was indistinguishable from other members of the same sequence type by conventional methods (R. Miller, J. Price, E. Batty et al., unpublished data). WGS appears to be uniquely well suited to detect new pathogen variants as they emerge, track their spread and direct effort to formulate infection control strategies. WGS is increasing our understanding of the micro-evolution of S. aureus during long-term carriage and its relationship with disease states. Young et al. used WGS to investigate serial isolates of S. aureus during long-term carriage and later during an episode of invasive disease.4 This showed a mutation rate (roughly one mutation per genome every seven weeks) during long-term carriage similar to that estimated by Harris et al. for the mutation rates within a single lineage, ST239. However, blood culture isolates differed from the ancestral colonizing strain by eight mutations. As a consequence, the invasive strain's genome incorporated stop codons that encoded a truncated regulatory protein, thereby providing potential clues about the nature of the changes associated with pathogenesis. McAdam et al. applied WGS to 87 isolates to show how EMRSA-16 emerged 35 years ago, and spread in the UK by transmission from hospitals in large cities to regional locations.55\n",

He et al. used WGS to demonstrate that the strains of Clostridium difficile associated with disease emerged from multiple lineages.58 This contradicted the received wisdom that bacterial pathogens arise from a single lineage as a result of gaining genetic properties through gene transfer or mutation. Didelot et al. used WGS to investigate cases of C. difficile infection that appeared to be linked according to conventional typing results (X. Didelot, D. Eyre, M. Cule et al., unpublished data). The resolution provided by WGS made it possible to \u2018rule out\u2019 transmission for the majority of cases, thereby challenging the assumption that C. difficile infection is usually acquired as a result of direct transmission from symptomatic patients. WGS has already been applied during the investigation of some high-profile outbreaks. The Asian origins of the Haitian outbreak of cholera that killed several thousand people in 2010\u20132011 were determined through WGS of the outbreak strain of Vibrio cholera.59 In 2003 WGS was used to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, showing it to be a previously unrecognized coronavirus.60 In 2011 sequencing technology was used to characterize a Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain that affected nearly 4000 people and caused 47 deaths in Europe and North America. Sequencing rapidly confirmed clonal expansion from a common ancestor and allowed identification of virulence factors.61 Gardy et al. used WGS to evaluate a Canadian outbreak of tuberculosis.62 Outbreak isolates were indistinguishable by conventional genetic fingerprinting methods (MIRU-VNTR), and epidemiological information suggested a probable point source. WGS of isolates revealed that two distinct lineages were circulating simultaneously. Evolutionary analysis using historical isolates from the region showed that both lineages were present long before the dual outbreak was recognized. WGS was able to \u2018rule in\u2019 four historical tuberculosis cases that had not previously been recognized as part of the outbreak. Hence, WGS provides a tool for optimizing contact tracing resources.",

The relationship between genotype and differences in phenotype in clinically relevant strains can be investigated. For example, desktop sequencing has been shown to allow rapid identification of mutations associated with unusual antibiotic susceptibility patterns, variations in strain growth rates, and the development of small colony variants.57 As long as the association between genotype and phenotype are well understood, in silico interrogation of a WGS could be used to predict antibiotic resistance and virulence and effectively guide management earlier. For example using a \u2018basic local alignment search tool\u2019 (BLAST).63 An automated framework exists (BIGSdb) for simultaneously querying several genes from several genomes.64 This approach also provides a bridge between WGS and previous methods based on sequencing such as spa-typing or MLST since the loci targeted by these methods can be extracted from the whole genomes. PFGE and MLVA types should also be predicted directly from WGS data. This will ensure that the wealth of information that has been accumulated using these previous typing methods does not go to waste. Genome-wide association studies to uncover the genetic basis of severe disease phenotypes could be undertaken.65 In addition to known associations there is the potential to identify previously unknown virulence genes associated with clinical phenotypes. This is highlighted by the discovery of more than 70 novel candidate virulence factors that were identified when the first two S. aureus genomes were sequenced.11 A recent comparison of three S. aureus whole genomes isolated sequentially over a period of 26 months from the same cystic fibrosis patient revealed several genes under diversifying selection which could indicate that they play an essential role for chronic infection.66 As sequencing of the human genome becomes more routine it will be possible to investigate in great detail the genetic basis for the interplay between host and commensal or pathogen. It might for example become possible to determine the reasons why some people become persistent carriers while others do not. It may become possible to predict susceptibility to invasive staphylococcal infection and to target preventive measures accordingly.",
