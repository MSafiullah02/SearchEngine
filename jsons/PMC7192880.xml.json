In a Danish study of the temporal association between influenza activity and frequency of fetal death in 1994\u20132009, there was no statistically significant correlation between time series of weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation proportions and time series of weekly proportions of spontaneous abortions or stillbirths [11]. On the other hand, a US study of pregnant women hospitalized during influenza seasons in 1998\u20132008 demonstrated increased odds of intrauterine fetal demise among delivery hospitalizations complicated by respiratory illness compared to non-respiratory delivery hospitalizations [12]. However, this study was considered to be at a very high risk of diagnostic ascertainment bias [2].",

For instance, the validity of diagnoses of unexplained antepartum fetal death as registered in the MBRN has previously been found to be sufficiently high for large-scale epidemiologic studies [31]. Large population-based registries are crucial to the surveillance of a variety of exposures and outcomes, particularly when clinical trials are not possible. Moreover, many small-sample studies are hampered by low statistical power\u2014especially in the case of rare exposures or outcomes. This is less of a concern in large registry-based studies.",

More precisely, we lacked confirmation that the R80 diagnoses reflected true influenza infections, as they are based mostly on clinical symptoms and not routinely laboratory-confirmed. However, other ICPC-2 codes for unspecific symptoms such as \u201cupper respiratory infection, acute\u201d (R74), \u201ccough\u201d (R05), and \u201cfever\u201d (A03) are much more commonly used in primary health care, suggesting that a code for influenza is based on a more thorough evaluation of the clinical picture. Although only a small fraction of patients had laboratory confirmation of influenza, primary-health-care physicians are instructed to consider whether there is influenza in close contacts or an ongoing influenza epidemic, in addition to other relevant criteria for influenza, before assigning a diagnosis (Online Resource 1). Even so, some R80 diagnoses may be a result of similar symptoms caused by other respiratory viruses (i.e., differential diagnoses of influenza virus infection). To increase the reliability of influenza infections, we therefore discarded all R80 diagnoses in pregnancy made outside the predefined influenza seasons under study. This reduced the number of birth records in the study sample with at least one influenza diagnosis in pregnancy by 6.5%: from 12,728 to 11,896 birth records. Moreover, all influenza diagnoses were limited to women seeking medical care, and with that, we no doubt misclassified cases of asymptomatic/subclinical or mild, less severe infections of influenza as unexposed. Hence, we expect the current study to reflect associations with more severe influenza.",

If so, we have underestimated the overall risk of fetal death associated with first-trimester ILI during the pandemic season.",

During the pandemic, about 90% of all vaccinees receiving at least one dose of vaccine against 2009 pandemic influenza were registered in SYSVAK [23]. The estimated annual seasonal influenza vaccine coverage in the general Norwegian population in 2006\u20132017 was approximately 10% (unpublished data based on distributed doses, unused doses, and vaccinations registered in SYSVAK). Uptake is likely to be higher in defined risk groups. It is conceivable that vaccination might affect the risk of fetal death while simultaneously reducing the risk of ILI in the pregnant woman, thereby confounding the association between maternal influenza during pregnancy and risk of fetal death. However, the low completeness of seasonal influenza vaccinations reported to SYSVAK limited our ability to include these in our study. Pandemic vaccination has previously been shown not to be associated with increased risk of fetal death [18]. Accordingly, adjustment for pandemic vaccination in the current study had little impact on the estimates for pandemic influenza in the supplementary analyses restricted to mid-May 2009 through September 2010, indicating that pandemic vaccination may not be an important confounder in this respect.",

Thus, some early second-trimester fetal deaths are likely to be missing from our study sample. If registrations of early pregnancy losses from birth clinics were dependent on the mothers being diagnosed with influenza in primary health care, our results could be inflated. However, the registries are managed independently, and the increased risk after infection was present throughout pregnancy, making this potential bias less of a concern.",
