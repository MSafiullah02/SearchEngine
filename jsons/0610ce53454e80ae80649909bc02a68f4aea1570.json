For example, we have observed an unprecedented number of staff requesting Americans with Disabilities Act exemptions. Physicians and nurses are worried about their families, and some hesitate to go home in fear of exposing family members to infection. It is common to see emotional exhaustion in the intensive care unit (ICU). We have observed front-line health care providers emotionally breaking down, mainly due to the added pressure to choose between family responsibilities and their inner sense of duty toward patients. At the same time, we have seen an overwhelming influx of support from medical leadership, public and private acknowledgments, community support (eg, food sent to care units), as well as additional services offered to staff, such as music therapy, counseling services, chaplain services, and accommodations in work schedules. Other organizational adaptations include allocation of more resources (eg, float nurses, physicians, patient care assistants, and new equipment). Moving forward, our institution has plans for marshaling resources from surgeons, anesthesiologists, other medical specialists across all disciplines, and, in extreme circumstances, anyone with medical training and background.",

COVID-19 arose most likely from animal-to-human transfer in Wuhan, China. Unlike previous coronavirus outbreaks, the current COVID-19 emergence was marked by high rates of person-to-person transmission, including from asymptomatic carriers, combined with high severity of illness in vulnerable populations, including those with very common preexisting chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease. 6 The dilemma posed to health care workers is 2fold: first, the anticipated, and now experienced, overload on the health care system capacity to respond to this pandemic with a suitable flow of equipment; and second, the high risk posed to health care workers on the front lines and their family members as a result of constant exposure. The public has been repeatedly called on to \"flatten the curve,\" in reference to the social and behavioral changes that we as a society can undertake to slow the spread of disease. This strategy has been prominent in US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports since 2007, with maintenance of the guidelines as recent as 2017. 7, 8 This strategy was even deftly memed by medical experts on social media. 9 However, across several states, implementation of these preventive measures has fallen short of desired goals. 1,2,10-14",

The incident command team was rapidly assembled; leadershipemployee communication was constant and responsive; and human resources (HR) adapted policies to employee needs. To long-standing employees, these adaptations were not surprising, because our leadership and teams have literally weathered storms before, including in recent history, Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Harvey.

Likewise, procedures for maintaining sensitive research areas such as our animal laboratories, clinical trials, and expedited institutional review board (IRB) approval mechanisms for disaster-critical research, much of which is now being implemented nationwide, are reminiscent of ride-out and recovery procedures already commonplace in a Texas Gulf Coast medical center. These proactive, positive responses corroborate that the best way to weather a storm is to look where storms have repeatedly been weathered. In a more direct way, we have seen this for the COVID pandemic in portions of Asia like Singapore and Hong Kong, which were previously affected most by SARS and novel influenza A (H1N1pdm09) virus of 2009 (H1N1) avian influenza and have likewise adapted comparatively faster to COVID-19. 19 Digital communication tools have also shown promise in enabling remote work as well as intrainstitutional collaborative efforts. COVID-19 has brought health care professionals together across cities, states, and countries. For example, in the Greater Houston area alone, there have been more than 200 intensivists, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) specialists, and other specialized providers communicating through popular social media platforms (eg, WhatsApp) and learning from one another. In addition, this pandemic has opened the opportunity for innovations and adoption of alternative care delivery methods like telemedicine and virtual ICUs.

With the rise of COVID-19, several innovative designs were proposed to protect the health care workers on the front lines from the rapidly and widely spreading virus. 23 However, there is a dearth of manufacturing capacity and materials to produce many of these solutions. Systems of innovation that were developed and honed during other national emergencies when most resources were constrained (eg, the Functional Analysis Systems Technique [FAST] developed during the Manhattan Project) 24 are being revisited to tackle the problem nationally and globally. We need these solutions to buy time for effective antiviral medications and a vaccine for COVID-19. Meanwhile, there is a need to provide technical oversight to ensure that new designs meet minimum safety requirements. For example, during this pandemic, an abundance of homemade masks and gowns were designed and adopted without proper attention to fit and leak protection, potentially leading to a false perception of protection among health care workers.",

It is beyond the logistical capabilities of any government to provide what is needed to every citizen when the scope and magnitude of the disaster are beyond a localized event (eg, hurricanes, large-scale wildfires, and earthquakes). Such disasters strain national capacity for response. It was local authorities, in many cases aided by private citizens, that kept us all together, as one (eg, the Cajun Navy's role during Katrina 28 and Houstonians' response during Harvey 29 ). We can harness the government, industry, and individual efforts and resources to effectively mitigate such disasters and challenges.
