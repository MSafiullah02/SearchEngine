The fundamental composition of microbes is discussed as well as their importance in classifi cation of microbes into genus and species. Classical microbiological methods in general seek to defi ne the common features of specifi c bacterial groups as a means of classifi cation and identifi cation of microbes. Thus, the focus was to describe the common features which discriminated closely related groups of organisms. In contrast, the newer molecular methods often seek to expand the classification of microbes not only as a means to organize microbial phylogeny but also to differentiate signatures between microbes identifi ed within a species in greater detail. Molecular biology tools are used both as an adjunct to established methods and as replacement for classical methods for detection, discrimination, or identifi cation of bacterial and viral species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "2.1", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "As discussed in Chap. 1 , the application of forensics to microbiology is important to public security and public health. A large component of threat reduction for biological attacks involves the use of appropriate antibiotics and/or prophylactic vaccination. Application of these mitigating technologies requires some foreknowledge of the threat; hence, one component of microbial forensics is rapid identifi cation of the threat. A second component of the microbial forensics is careful examination with the goal of attribution since encoded in the concept is a law enforcement application. In addition to the chapters in this book, there are several outstanding reviews which address the requirements and gaps in current bioforensics for human and plant biothreats [1] [2] [3] . One major difference in the application of forensic assays for public safety and for law enforcement is the requirement for speed and specifi city. Assays which impact public safety must be rapid and be suitable for presumptive diagnostic purposes. Presumptive diagnostics are those which are used as an adjunct to clinical tests and to assist the physician in patient evaluation. Tests which can be used at point of care or at the scene are preferred so that rapid treatment or triage of susceptible populations can be emplaced where they will do the most good. Tests which describe attribution characteristics related to a crime can be slower but must be highly specifi c. This chapter describes the features of microbes which are used by microbiologists for identifi cation and categorization of biological organisms and intrinsic features of bacteria which can be used in forensic applications for attribution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The concept of attribution, a critical component of microbial forensics, differs in approach from diagnostics in that the focus of analysis is not necessarily limited to disease-producing organisms. Attribution includes not only diseaseproducing organisms but organisms which may hitchhike with the sample of interest such as phages and other environmental contaminants (pollen, dust, plant/animal DNA). Likewise, metabolic products and growth media residue are important to attribution and may be loosely associated with collected samples. Classical microbial methods do not address these components, but many of the newer tools for molecular biology and physical chemistry can be used to include characterization of these materials.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Classical microbiological tools are founded in observational techniques for bacteria, some of which originated with the invention of the microscope by Leeuwenhoek in 1674. Notably, less than 5% and perhaps as little as 1% of all bacteria can be cultured in the laboratory. If one includes all viruses infecting all species on earth, the number becomes lower by several orders of magnitude. Hence, one caveat of classical microbial methods is that the tools used to describe microbial development and provide systematic organization are based on a statistically minor portion of all bacteria [ 4 ] . This is acceptable for medically important species since classical microbiological techniques, especially those adapted to the clinical laboratory, are biased for analysis of human pathogens. When microbial analysis techniques require description and typing of environmental organisms rather than microbial pathogens, many laboratory methods especially clinical tech niques may be inappropriate or give false information. This is especially true for automated laboratory tools which require matching to known signatures in the database. Environmental microbes, since they do not produce disease and therefore are not isolated from patient samples, are not frequently represented in clinical databases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 591, "end": 596, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "How Microbiologists Look at Microbes"}, {"text": "Classical microbiology uses both gross and microscopic morphology to identify microbes. Gross morphology includes colony shape, size, and surface features ( Fig. 2.1 ). For example, Bacillus atropheu s strain globigii produces an orange-pigmented colony on tryptic soy agar but produces small white colonies on other media. The structures assigned to bacteria -cocci (round), bacilli (rods), or spirochetes (corkscrew) -can be readily seen via light microscopy with no sample preparation. Generally, bacterial isolates are further differentiated at the time of microscopic examination by staining. The gram stain is one of the most useful and commonly used tools to differentiate bacteria beyond the genus level. This staining procedure named for its inventor, Hans Christian Gram, supplies both biochemical information about the composition of bacteria (see Chap. 3 for more detail concerning the biochemistry of bacterial cell walls) and special information regarding the distribution of chemicals within the cell. Gram-negative bacteria are unique in that they contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a polymeric structure found between the cell wall and the cellular membrane (found in all bacteria). LPS lies internal to the cell wall and helps regulate the permeability of the cell among other functions. The fi rst stain is crystal violet which stains all bacteria blue-purple followed by an iodine fi xative. The critical step is then the decolorizer which is methanol. Methanol fi xes the cells causing the pores in the walls of gram-positive cells to collapse and become sealed thus retaining the blue dye. The methanol also dissolves the lipid portion of the cell wall of gram-negative cells causing them to become more porous and allowing the dye to leak out. At this point, gramnegative cells can be distinguished from grampositive cells because they are clear. A red counter stain of fuchsin or safranin is used, giving the gram-negative cells a pink appearance to make their shape and size easier to see microscopically. The patterning of staining can be important in categorizing bacteria to the species level. For example, the staining pattern of the biothreat agent, Yersinia pestis is described as \"safety pin\" since the gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria stains pink with the exception of blue staining at the ends of the rods indicating the specifi c exclusion of LPS from apical ends.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 165, "text": "Fig. 2.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Classical Methods Applied to Forensic Characterization of Unknown Samples"}, {"text": "Viruses, in contrast, have many more shapes by which they are categorized but can only be viewed using electron microscopy.

The newly emergent coronavirus, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was identifi ed fi rst by electron microscopic examination of patient samples followed by the use of molecular tools for genetic and immunological identifi cation [ 5 ] . Therefore, a toolbox for forensic analysis should include a combination of methods based on both classical methods and new molecular tools. High confi dence can be assumed when these tests agree especially since the databases and signature libraries in general were built from and validated by organisms identifi ed by classical methods. Thus, there is an internal dependence of the new tools on the results predicted by the older classical methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 515, "end": 520, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Classical Methods Applied to Forensic Characterization of Unknown Samples"}, {"text": "A great deal of forensic information can be obtained from analysis of the composition of microbes beyond genetic information.

Some key areas are highlighted below.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Classical Methods Applied to Forensic Characterization of Unknown Samples"}, {"text": "Unlike mammals and higher eukaryotes, growth medium may signifi cantly affect the molecular and structural composition of bacteria as well as the isotopic profi le of its components. For example, the placement of freshly isolated samples of bacteria on laboratory media alters the fatty acid composition of the bacteria [6] [7] [8] . As discussed in Chap. 3 , fatty acid composition can be an important tool for microbial identifi cation and strain distinction. It is unclear from these studies whether laboratory media are in themselves selective for new variants in the isolated sample with altered fatty acid profi les or whether the isolate itself changes to meet its changing nutrient availability [ 6 ] . Important to address is the issue of clonality in cultured materials. When isolating bacteria on plated media, most procedures are initiated from a single isolated colony on a plate. The incorrect assumption is that each colony arises from a single bacterial cell; however, in reality it can only be stated that a colony arose from at least one bacterial cell . Many organisms do not grow as isolated individual strains. The bacilli-and coccishaped microbes discussed above do not always grow as individual cells but may grow as chains or clusters, respectively. The average length of the chains or numbers in each cluster is a growth characteristic which is useful in distinguishing bacteria to the genus or species level. Both chain length and cluster size are infl uenced by culture media effects [ 9, 10 ] . Microscopic examination of cultures of Staphylococcus aureus show \"grape-like\" clusters of cocci-shaped bacteria, the smallest of which is generally made of diplococci (two cells) and the largest is 12 or more cells. Without robust efforts to disassociate these clusters prior to plating, it is unlikely that a single colony of Staphylococcus has descended from a single cell. Hence, enumeration of bacteria by colony count (serial dilution followed by plating on growth media) is really only an estimate and frequently an underestimate of the total number of viable bacteria present. Depending on the viability of the sample, it may or may not refl ect the number of target bacterial genomes present since polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies (discussed below) do not differentiate between viable and dead cells. Better agreement is expected using direct counting via a Petroff Hauser chamber. The Petroff Hauser chamber is a low-tech solution in that it merely provides a calibrated area in which individual objects are counted microscopically. It does not discriminate between live or dead. Use of the Petroff Hauser chamber and colony counts can provide a good estimate of the health, i.e., relative viability of the sample.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 323, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 324, "end": 327, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 328, "end": 331, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 703, "end": 708, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1515, "text": "[ 9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1520, "text": "10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Culture Conditions as a Consideration in Forensic Microbiology"}, {"text": "Even simple direct microscopic examination of raw samples combined with microbial culture can provide the investigator with a better estimate of the initial concentration of microbial targets being analyzed in the original sample.

The ability to identify unculturable microbes further enhances the forensic analysis of a sample. Unculturable organisms may not be the target of concern for biocrimes since one of the underlying requirements for nearly all types of infectious agents is that they are easily cultured; however, contaminating unculturable microbes can provide information regarding comparative temporal and geolocation typing of microbial communities. At the species level and, in particular, at the strain level, the overall makeup of microbial communities can be extremely specifi c. Some microbes will persist in environments with few alterations for years, while other organisms will persist seasonally or be otherwise chronologically limited. In this case, both the dynamics and stability of the population contain useful information for comparative purposes. It is important to stress comparison when considering characterization of unculturable microbes since the application space afforded by characterizing microbial communities and its variations can be infi nite.

First described for Vibrio cholera e, VBNC states have been observed for Escherichia coli , Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and bioterrorism agents such as Fransicella tularensis and Burkeholderia species (as reviewed in [ 13 ] ). VBNC complicates environmental sample analysis when looking for source attribution in waste water, soil, or other environmental samples since standard culture methods do not apply.

If the perpetrator of a biocrime selects a medium known to alter molecular composition in order to increase microbial virulence, this information is resident in the recovered samples with or without the recovery of the growth medium.

These media are used to exclude the growth of nontarget organisms, accentuate visual features of the colony, or for gross biochemical assays which describe the enzymatic profi le of the bacteria. For example, one classic test for Bacillus anthracis is the growth of the organism on sheep blood agar (SBA) plates. Lysis of the red blood cells in the agar is known as beta hemolysis and is carried out through the activation of the hemolysin enzyme. Hemolysis appears as a clear ring surrounding the colony on a dark red plate. Bacillus anthracis, unlike its near neighbor Bacillus cereus, is nonhemolytic on standard SBA plates. Notably, if red blood cells are washed prior to addition to the plate media, Bacillus anthracis colonies exhibit a clear zone around the colonies indicating hemolysin enzyme activity. Hemolysin genes are known to be promiscuous among bacterial species [ 14 ] , so detection without functional assessment is not suffi cient for microbial characterization. Point mutation analysis of the three-part hemolysin enzyme complex can be applied using genetic techniques, but in this case, a simpler and less costly biochemical screen for exclusion may suffi ce.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1039, "end": 1045, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Impact of Culture on Microbial Identifi cation and Attribution Elements"}, {"text": "Early methods in bacterial identifi cation made use of culture biology for identifi cation. Carbon source utilization, synthesis of lipids, and oxygen requirements were standard methods for screening bacteria. So successful and well validated were these approaches in classical microbial analysis that several commercial enterprises simplifi ed these tests reducing them from racks of test tubes to single 96-well-plate or credit-card-sized formats ( Table 2. 2 ). Two general biochemical types of assays are highlighted. The fi rst compares the growth of organisms on a variety of simple substrates. Low-oxygen or oxygen-free conditions are replicated by the addition of mineral oil layers over the growth solutions. The combination of individual tests is fed into any automated algorithm which compares the test outputs to a database of outputs for known microbes. The resulting test pattern is matched based on a best fi t for microbial identifi cation. These systems are generally used for speciation of bacteria but are typically unable to distinguish bacterial strains within the same species [46] [47] [48] [49] . Since its development, 16S RNA analysis (see discussion below) has replaced many of these tests due to its accuracy and speed [ 15, 16 ] . An alternative biochemical assay uses Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) analysis to profi le bacterial lipids. MIDI is an automated system which uses gas chromatography to determine the pattern of lipids which can be derived in a bacterial cell. Lipids found in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and attached to proteins and sugars are important regulators of specifi c bacterial cell functions and can be used to discriminate bacteria to the strain level.

The taxonomic name, i.e., Bacillus anthracis or Yersinia pestis , refers to the organism or causative agent of a disease, while the more general description, i.e., anthrax or plague, refers to the disease itself.

In higher eukaryotes, speciation is defi ned by the ability of two individuals to successfully interbreed. Failure to produce offspring or failure to produce offspring capable of reproduction is indicative of two different species. Speciation in bacteria is much more nebulous. Originally, the morphological and biochemical differences between organisms were determined to categorize isolated bacteria into groups. Type strains are the strains which exhibit many typical characteristics of a species. Usually, type strains are among the fi rst representatives to defi ne the species and may not represent all of the most common feature of the species. Shape, size, and culture appearance all go into the morphological distinction of bacterial types. Most bacteria exist as actively growing cells called vegetative cells. Only a few subsets of bacteria are able to produce spores, viable but dormant structures which encapsulate the genome of bacteria. Spores enable bacteria to survive in unfavorable conditions until the correct growth requirements are detected, at which time the spore undergoes a process called germination where the spore breaks down and releases a replicating vegetative cell. Using classical microbiological methods, bacteria are further distinguished based on biochemical differences. In bacteria, sugar utilization and other nutrient requirements are noted. Many of the selective media that can be used to enrich mixed samples for a particular bacteria species are based on the restriction of carbon sources to a single type of sugar or preferred sugar which allows the target species to grow fastest, i.e., Yersinia agar which is selective for Yersinia spp . or PLET medium which is selective for Bacillus anthracis [ 21 ] .

Recently, a rapid 2-h culture test for low-cost screening to rule out Bacillus anthracis exposure has been developed [ 20 ] . The test is based on the fact that Bacillus species exhibit differential beta hemolysis or zonal lysis and clearing of red blood cells surrounding the margins of a colony. Microscopic examination of cultures for gram-positive rods and spores coupled with the presence of active beta hemolysis is enough information to rule out the presence of Bacillus anthracis. Since tests such as these are indicators, it would seem simple to develop rapid DNA dipstick screens for the presence of the hemolysin gene to rule out Bacillus anthracis ; however, as it turns out, Bacillus anthracis has a complete hemolysin gene. It is only when the red blood cells are specially washed prior to the preparation of the agar that beta hemolysis can be noted in Bacillus anthracis [ 22 ] . Hence, partial genetic characterization such as the presence or absence of a gene is not always defi nitive in microbial differentiation. In the case of exclusionary decisions regarding a sample, the absence of a gene may be suffi cient to eliminate a sample from further analysis.

By this mechanism, there is no ancestral link between the bacterial species which share these genes, and in fact, horizontal or lateral gene transfer is not limited to transfer within members of a species [ 26 ] . Speciation in other organisms is often represented by punctuated genetic differences, i.e., appearance of new genes, while in bacteria speciation, the distinction between species is more of a genetic continuum of dubious linearity. As noted by Carl Woese, \"one necessarily questions the universal phylogenetic tree. That compelling tree image resides deep in our representation of biology. But the tree is no more than a graphical device; it is not some a priori form that nature imposes upon the evolutionary process. It is not a matter of whether your data are consistent with a tree, but whether tree topology is a useful way to represent your data\" [ 27 ] . In other words, evolutionary trees and categorization of microbes into defi ned units is a tool and not necessarily the rule for defi ning bacterial identity. The presence of a new gene in a bacterium of known classifi cation may indicate that the target has been in close proximity with other species and may provide forensic information about the life and/or residence of the microbe prior to its isolation and sampling. For example, the presence of partial genes from a soil bacterium found only in specifi c geological regions in a fairly ubiquitous pathogen may suggest the location where a bacterium was grown or isolated. Unlike growth media and nutrient components, these features may not be lost when the organism is cultured. Likewise, recovered viruses are good sources for information about the methods and sources of materials used to produce them. Viruses are not considered living, and therefore, their classifi cation is more basic. Viruses are classifi ed based on their structure (visible at the necessary level of detail by electron microscopy), their genetic makeup (one or two strands of genetic material, RNA or DNA and orientation of RNA strand if single stranded), and the presence of a lipid envelope.

Like the science of forensics, which is a continuum of methods from exclusion to attribution [ 2 ] , genetic profi ling of microbes is a continuum from which it is sometimes diffi cult to make clear distinctions. Instead of cutoffs or limits, it is better to compare based on a degree of \"sameness\" when comparing two strains of bacteria. PCR is a process by which small amounts of nucleic acid is synthesized in vitro to make large amounts of an exact or nearly exact copy of nucleic acid. As a result, PCR has enabled countless new applications in human forensics, medicine, and agriculture by providing enough material for more robust analyses without the need for a living organism. PCR has been the subject of many excellent recent forensic reviews [ 1, 36, 48 ] and so will be discussed here relative to microbial applications. Briefl y, PCR works by amplifying DNA or, in the case of reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), amplifying RNA. This is possible due to the discovery of thermostable polymerases which retain their ability to extend short oligomers of nucleotides known as primers [ 37 ] . As for all DNA polymerases, a template is required in order for the polymerase to extend the new complementary DNA strand. Therefore, extension of the primer only occurs when the primer is bound to its DNA target. The number of DNA targets is limiting in the reaction initially. So to increase the number of DNA templates after the fi rst extension is complete, the two DNA strands are dissociated by raising the temperature to the point where the DNA \"melts.\" When the temperature is lowered, the next primer which is in high concentration in the reaction binds to the DNA template, and the process begins again. Using one primer, the process is rather slow and the increase in the DNA is linear. To make the process of amplifi cation logarithmic, a second primer is added which binds downstream of the fi rst primer on the complementary DNA template and any amplifi ed DNAs which have the DNA template sequence. Therefore, after the fi rst few cycles of primer binding (annealing), primer extension by the polymerase, and DNA melting, amplifi cation of the original DNA template is rare in comparison with amplifi cations of primers binding and reamplifying newly synthesized DNA.

For example, initial screening of forensic samples to fi nd the source of a suspected Bacillus anthracis attack would likely include amplifi cation and detection of genes for protective antigen (pag), lethal factor (lef) or edema factor (ef), and capsule (cap). All of these genes must be present for virulence [ 41 ] .

This method has been used for the toxin genes named above with similar results and sensitivities (Jackman, personal communication).

As mentioned above, lateral gene transfer, whether by natural methods or by the use of genetic engineering, has made the assignment of individual genes (both plasmid borne and chromosomal) to specifi c organisms less rigid. Since lateral gene transfer involves the transfer of whole genes, duplicated nonfunctional genes, and partial gene segments, the presence of a particular sequence may or may not be signifi cant.

The ribosome encodes the machinery for the translation of messenger RNA transcripts into their respective protein products.

Though their genomes are smaller, by comparison to humans, the number of microbial species is staggering, and therefore, the potential number of multi-VTNR for typing all species of bacteria is even larger. As a result, not all bacteria can be readily typed by this method. MLVA analysis is heavily dependent upon a rich database of sequences for a particular bacterial species or subspecies [ 70 ] .

For forensic application, whole genome analysis and comparative genomics will be the Rosetta stone for microbial identifi cation for isolate level discrimination as well as for specifi c attribution.

Based from the human SNP efforts, for a mutation to be designated as a SNP, the polymorphism (rather than a random or common mutation) must occur in greater than 1% of the population (SNP consortium, [ 79 ] ). Thus, translation of this description to microbial populations is somewhat more diffi cult. Is the population of bacteria defi ned as a mixture of strains, colonies on a plate, or individuals in a culture tube? Classifying true polymorphisms from mutations requires the simultaneous development of statistical tools to track the stability of polymorphisms in a collection of strains [ 80 ] . One of the best examples to illustrate this development occurs in a series of papers published over 5 years, describing the search for SNPs in the Bacillus anthracis genome [ 81 ] . Prior to these studies, Bacillus anthracis was considered to have a relatively monogenetic type. Its low rate of spontaneous mutation supported that conclusion. However, once the genome was assembled, it was clear that Bacillus anthracis could be differentiated at the strain and isolate level based on the analysis of approximately 60 SNPs. Further work with complete and redundant sequences led to the discovery of over 3,500 SNPs in the plasmid and chromosomal Bacillus anthracis genome [ 82 ] . In an effort to make microbial typing easier using comparative genomics based on SNPs, sequencing primers specifi c to 32 of the chromosomal SNPs which showed the best discrimination among isolates were down-selected and used in subsequent restricted sequencing approaches to highlight these polymorphisms by strain [ 83 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 297, "end": 303, "text": "[ 79 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 690, "end": 696, "text": "[ 80 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 872, "end": 878, "text": "[ 81 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1377, "text": "[ 82 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1702, "text": "[ 83 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Whole Genome Analysis: Canonical Sequences and SNP Analysis"}, {"text": "Still it is important to note that SNP analysis of whole genomes is of greatest utility when the overall mutation rate is low. Both laboratory and environmental effects have been documented which induce the evolution of the mutator phenotype in some bacteria in a population [ 84 ] . Culture stress, exposure to antibiotics in the host, and coexistence with other viral pathogens have all been demonstrated to induce the mutator phenotype [ 85, 86 ] . Mutator bacteria have signifi cantly higher rates of spontaneous mutation than other members of their community. Deletions or alterations in the genes associated with polymerase function have been demonstrated to induce mutator types in Bacillus anthracis [ 87 ] . The phenotype is induced presumably by enhanced adaptation under environmentally stressful conditions and by providing the most diverse genetic background for survival selection by speeding adaptation under environmentally stressful conditions and providing a more diverse genetic background. All DNA-containing microbes including viruses have the same rates of spontaneous mutation [ 24 ] . As a precautionary step or to aid the interpretation of SNP data sets, general screening methods such as monitoring for rifampicin resistance might be benefi cial prior to whole genome analysis especially when extensive culture on highly restrictive media, suboptimal storage, or environmental stressors may act as the foundation for induction of this phenotype [ 86 ] . This is particularly true for host-derived materials relative to long-established laboratory adapted strains. Observed elevations in mutations in culture material should be taken as a warning sign that cultures contain mutator phenotypes and relative SNP between strains should be surveyed for artifacts.

While a variety of methods are possible, mass spectrometry is a technology which is central to all these applications. The most commonly used systems are Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), Electrospray Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF), and Gas Chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [88] [89] [90] [91] . Two of these technologies, MALDI-TOF and ESI-TOF, are commonly used to detect and identify proteins using sequence-related information, which can sometimes be crucial to identifi cation of microbes or understanding differences observed in microbes from the same lineage. Why is the sequencing of proteins and peptides necessary if the genome, sequenced and assembled, can be used to predict the amino acid sequence of translated genomic products? The rule of one gene-one transcript-one protein is frequently ignored in the microbial world [ 92 ] . Posttranscriptional modifi cation of RNA called RNA editing has been well documented [ 93 ] . Viruses and bacteria can very specifi cally alter a nucleotide in transcribed RNA resulting in a change in the translation if a coding sequence resulting in the incorporation of a different amino acid from that represented in the coding sequence. Other mechanisms used include genomic stuttering and insertion of sequences at the level of the RNA.

These materials include fl ow factors added to aerosolized preparation to improve distribution of the target microbe and encapsulants which can be used to stabilize microbes [ 94, 95 ] . The purpose of these types of stabilizers is to promote the survival of the microbe in harsh environments or to act as a trigger for microorganism growth until the correct environment (pH, temperature, pressure, etc.) is reached.
