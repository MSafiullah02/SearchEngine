When the virus enters the cell, the viral genome begins to replicate and translates structural proteins. After the process inside the cytoplasm, the vesicles containing the virus particles fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus. After the entry of virus to the cell, antigen presentation cells (APC) -the main part of antiviral immunity- begin to present the antigens. Afterward, antigen presentation subsequently stimulates virus-specific B and T cells and they mediate the body\u2019s humoral immunity and immunoglobulin M and G production begins. Specific IgM antibodies disappear approximately at the end of 12th week. IgG antibody lasts for a longer time and the SARS-specific IgG antibodies primarily are S-specific and N-specific antibodies [12]. There are more researches on the cellular immunity of coronavirus compared to humoral immunity [8]. The current data seems to indicate that the viral infection is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. In some cases, a \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 occurs of which the effect is extensive tissue damage. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) triggers this storm, which is produced by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues. This cytokine storm may result in an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction [8].",

ARDS is known as the common immunopathological result for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. The cytokine storm results with a violent attack by the immune system to the body, which cause ARDS and multiple organ failure, and finally lead to death in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, just like in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [13]. The cytokine storm and the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-a, TGFb, etc.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, etc.) by immune effector cells ends with ARDS in SARS-CoV infection [14].

Suggested reasons include having a more active innate immune response, healthier respiratory tracts (because of not exposing to cigarette smoke and air pollution as adults), and fewer underlying disorders. In addition, they are generally overprotected by parents, and if there is not any positive case in family, the possibility of being infected decreases [15]. A dangerous and uncontrolled immune response in adults may also explain with a robust immune response which may lead to ARDS [15]. It was found that ACE2 expression in rat lung has been found to dramatically decrease with age [15]. This finding may not be consistent with a relatively low susceptibility of children to COVID-19. On the other hand, studies show that ACE2 is involved in protective mechanisms of the lung. It may protect against severe lung injury induced by respiratory virus infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients [16,17]. The difference between adults and children in case of severity may be related to differences in receptors in the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and altered inflammatory responses to pathogens [18].",

It is certain that the main sources of the infection are patients infected by 2019-nCoV with or without clinical symptoms [5,6], but in addition, patients in the incubation period may also have potency to transmit the virus.

In case of circulation dysfunction, vasoactive drugs may be used to improve microcirculation [6]. In children, epinephrine is considered first-line, while norepinephrine can be added if shock persists despite the optimal dose of epinephrine. Continuous blood purification should be considered in cases of multiple organ failure (especially acute kidney injury), or capacity overload and life-threatening imbalance of water, electrolyte, and acid-base. If combined with liver failure, plasma exchange is feasible.13 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure ARDS, so it may also be effective in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Since there is a lack of clinical trial of ECMO on COVID-19, we could not conclude whether SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have benefited from ECMO at this time [57].",
