            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) represents the latest in the series of viral pathogens that recently (re\u2010)emerged to become a global healthcare problem. Indeed, spanning the entire history of humankind and to current days, viral pathogens constitute an enormous socioeconomic burden. Some viruses have high associated mortality rates, as is the case for Ebola virus, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.1 Other viruses are not life\u2010threatening but represent a major cause for morbidity. For these pathogens, greatest burden is that of containment and limiting the spread of the virus. Successes of medicinal chemistry in the design of antiviral agents are becoming more and more sound. Currently, 90 antiviral drugs categorized into 13 functional groups have been approved for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101), herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types 1 and 2, influenza, varicella zoster, hepatitis B and C, papilloma, and respiratory syncytial viruses.2, 3, 4 However, against the majority of viruses no treatment option exists. In addition, the conventional one\u2010bug\u2010one\u2010drug paradigm is insufficient to address the challenges of emerging and re\u2010emerging viruses,5 where medicinal chemistry usually lags behind and develops medication after the pathogen has become a problem. This comes in stark contrast with antibacterial treatments, which are specifically powerful due to the availability of antibiotics with broad antibacterial activity. Such broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents may have promising prospects for prophylactic or therapeutic settings. For example, several viruses including HIV\u20101, HSV\u20102, or ZIKV are transmitted via sexual intercourse,6, 7 and a single broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agent applied topically onto the mucosa would protect against these pathogens. Indeed, condoms that contain a lubricant active against HIV\u20101 and HSV\u20102 are already available.8\n",

            "text": "A promising strategy for broad\u2010spectrum antivirals is to block the first step in the viral life cycle\u2014the entry of the virus into the target cell. Most pathogenic viruses are surrounded by a lipid bilayer that harbors viral glycoproteins mediating a first unspecific interaction with ubiquitous cell surface structures, e.g., glycosaminoglycans. Upon engagement of specific receptor molecules, conformational changes in the glycoproteins trigger fusion of viral and cellular membranes, which ultimately leads to infection. Viral adsorption can be modulated by charged polymeric agents. Polycationic macromolecules such as polybrene,9 protamine sulphate,10 diethylaminoethyl dextran,11 or peptide nanofibrils12 bridge the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged viral and cellular membranes, thereby increasing rates of virion attachment and infection. This class of positively charged polymers is widely used as transduction enhancers to boost retroviral gene transfer.13 A notable exception to this is polyethyleneimine, a cationic polymer which reveals antiviral effects when derivatized with mannose14 or hydrophobic alkyl side chains.15 In turn, polyanionic polymers represent the largest class of materials that block viral adsorption and infection. Already in the 1960s, poly\u2010methacrylic acid (PMAA) was shown to suppress the infectivity of enveloped vesicular stomatitis, sindbis, and vaccinia viruses.16, 17, 18 In the past decades, especially with the advent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, several additional polyanionic polymers were described as antivirally active. Among these were sulphated polysaccharides and other sulphated polymers, polyphosphates, carbosilane dendrimers, or nucleic acid polymers, which inhibit a variety of enveloped viruses including HIV\u20101, HSV\u20101 and 2, or influenza virus.19, 20, 21 The mechanism underlying virus inhibition is often a direct interaction of the polyanion with viral glycoproteins thereby preventing receptor engagement and fusion.20, 22 Other modes of action are binding of polymers to cellular receptor(s),20, 23 intracellular inhibition of viral polymerases,23, 24 or suppression of viral budding.25 The broad antiviral activity renders polyanionic polymers interesting candidates for preventive applications. However, a distinct understanding of the structure\u2013activity relationship of this class of antivirals is missing.",

The specific aim of this study was to identify lead polymers with the broadest spectrum of antiviral activity against major existing, emerging, and re\u2010emerging viral pathogens, and to observe responsible structure\u2013activity characteristics. To achieve this, we synthesized a library of 14 carboxylate, phosphate/phosphonate, and sulfonate polymers differing by anionic functionality and hydrophobicity. These novel polymers were applied against a panel of major viral pathogens, i.e., HIV\u20101 and HSV\u20102, as well as pseudoparticles that mimic infection by influenza, Rabies and Lyssa, SARS, Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola viruses. Major focus was set on ZIKV against which currently no drug or vaccine exists. We identified lead candidates with a broad\u2010spectrum but also virus specific antiviral activity. Our results provide a clear suggestive view on what makes a virus susceptible to polymer\u2010based inhibition, and independently, a detailed analysis of which structural characteristics of the polymer make it a superior inhibitor of viral infectivity. We anticipate that the results of this study will prove useful for subsequent development of microbicides with activity against current and re\u2010merging pathogens.",

This aspect was deemed pivotal to ensure the synthesis of polymers with the widest possible diversity in terms of chemical composition. We considered polymers with anionic functionalities categorized into (i) carbon\u2010based carboxylates, (ii) phosphor\u2010based phosphates and phosphonates, and (iii) sulfur\u2010based sulfonates. Chemical diversity of commercially available (meth)acrylates and (meth)acrylamides is rather limited with only eight monomers readily available from commercial sources, which led us to design six additional monomers. To our knowledge, two of the phosphate/phosphonate monomers, 2\u2010acrylamidoethyl phosphate (AEP) and 2\u2010acrylamidoethyl phosphonic acid (APA) (corresponding polymers PAEP and PAPA, respectively, Figure\n\n1\n), have never been reported previously.27 Their methacrylamide counterparts 2\u2010methacrylamidoethyl phosphate (MEP) and 2\u2010methacrylamidoethyl phosphonic acid (MPA) (corresponding polymers PMEP and PMPA, respectively, Figure 1) have been reported previously but not used for controlled polymerization. These monomers are not commercially available and were de novo synthesized from available starting materials. Ethylacrylic acid (EAA) and propylacrylic acid (PAA) are available commercially in small amounts; the monomers were synthesized in one\u2010step syntheses with uncomplicated purifications and good yields, making it possible to obtain large quantities required for polymer synthesis.",

In the \u201ccell treatment\u201d setting, uninfected target cells were incubated with the polymers prior to viral challenge to identify leads that inhibit viral infection and are active in complex cell culture medium containing fetal calf serum. For the \u201cvirion treatment\u201d approach, polymers were preincubated with the virus to allow direct interaction between the polymers and then these mixtures were added to target cells resulting in a dilution of the polymer. This approach allows to identify compounds that directly interfere with viral infectivity and may be used as topical microbicides,31 or in filtration devices for biomedicine and biotechnology to inactivate virus.32, 33\n",

However, two polymers, poly(vinylbenzoic acid) (PVBzA) and poly(vinylbenzenesulfonate) (PSVBS), revealed anti\u2010ZIKV activity and shared structural similarity, as these are rather hydrophobic carboxylate\u2010 and sulfonate\u2010containing styrenic polymers.

IC50 values indicate that similar to ZIKV, \u201cvirus treatment\u201d was typically superior to \u201ccell treatment\u201d, which is most prominent for poly(3\u2010sulfopropyl acrylate) (PSPA) and poly(2\u2010acrylamido\u20102\u2010methyl\u20101\u2010propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) (Table 1). This observation reiterates that for polyanions, antiviral activity of the polymer is characterized with higher potency if the polymer is allowed to come into contact with the viral particles prior to being administered onto cells. For HIV\u20101, it appears that \u201cstrength\u201d of the polyanions as known from polyelectrolyte complexation39 is decisive and that the sulfur\u2010containing polymers are most potent, with IC50 values for \u201cvirus treatment\u201d being on the order of only a few \u00b5g L\u22121 (Table 1). Of note, other polyanionic polymers such as heparin, dextran sulfate, polyphosphates, or carbosilane dendrimers are less potent HIV\u20101 inhibitors with IC50 values in the high \u00b5g L\u22121 to low mg L\u22121 range.19, 21, 31, 40, 41 On par with the polysulfonates, carboxylates PAA and especially PMAA were also highly potent. By contrast, PEAA and PPAA, two polymers with significantly higher pKa (pK\na 6.5 vs 4.5 for PAA) and hence markedly lower ionization at physiological pH, were significantly less active and had IC50 values >5 mg L\u22121. Moreover, the three hydrophobic leads identified for the ZIKV treatment are rather inferior inhibitors in the case of HIV\u20101. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of polymers does not appear to be a strong contributing factor to the overall inhibitory effect of the polymer as is the case for ZIKV.",

For this, we generated lentiviral pseudoparticles encoding luciferase that were pseudotyped with the glycoproteins of Lyssa and Rabies virus (two neurotropic rhabdoviruses that cause rabies in humans and animals), Ebola and Marburg virus (which belong to the family of filoviruses and are responsible for sporadic outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fevers in Africa), SARS coronavirus (that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002), and Lassa virus (an arenavirus that causes Lassa fever). In addition, polymers were analyzed for inhibition of human adenovirus type 5, a nonenveloped virus with clinical relevance for immunosuppressed (transplant) patients.43, 44 As shown in Figure\n\n8\n and Figure S11 (Supporting Information), none of the polymers led to marked inhibition of adenovirus infection, whereas all tested pseudoparticles with the exception of influenza were inhibited by at least two polymers by more than 80% (For overall results of inhibitory activity of the polymer, see Figure\n\n9\n). An important observation from this screen is that \u201cstandard\u201d strong polyelectrolytes such as PAMPS or highly ionized PAA do not reveal broadness of antiviral activity, and that negative charge alone does not make the polymer a strong antiviral agent. This is further illustrated by the inhibitory activity of poly(phosphates/phosphonates): for all the viral particles, inhibitory effects of these polymers were minimal to nonexistent. A surprising exception to this conclusion is poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA) which proved to be highly effective against Marburg, SARS, and influenza virus, particularly for SARS (Figure 9). For influenza, PVPA proved to be the most effective of all the polyanions tested in this work. Among the sulfur\u2010containing polymers, styrenic PSVBS appears to be the strongest lead being the most effective inhibitor in this range of polymers for each of the pseudotyped viral particles (Figure 8). Similarly, PVBzA appears to be the strongest lead among the carboxylates in which case hydrophobic PEAA is also a good lead being particularly effective against the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg). Taken together, the data in this screen strongly support the notion that combination of anion charge and hydrophobicity of the polymer backbone is the necessary combination that makes up effective broadly acting antiviral polymers.",

The latter was most potent and inhibited clinically relevant ZIKV strains in physiologically relevant cell types with IC50 values in the mg L\u22121 range without causing any cytotoxic effects. This comes in contrast with recent reports on the two prototype polyanions, dextran sulfate and heparin, which were shown to exert only marginal antiviral activity against ZIKV.45, 46 For the carboxylate PEAA we provide evidence for a direct interaction with the virion, demonstrating that the identified lead polymers inhibit ZIKV with different mechanisms. A promising ad hoc application of polymers is their use as topical microbicide. It is now well established that besides mosquitos, ZIKV can also be transmitted via sexual intercourse.6, 7 Sexual transmission also results in ZIKV fever6, 7 and potentially microcephaly and brain malformations in fetuses.47, 48 Vaginally applied microbicides may help to protect woman at risk for acquiring ZIKV and other sexually transmitted viruses.

Our data indicate that lack of the envelope or an envelope with a dense GP shield makes viruses less susceptible to inhibition by the polymers. By contrast, sparse or moderate coverage of the enveloped viral particle makes the virus well susceptible to the polymer\u2010mediated inhibition, likely due to the more or less prominent interaction with the different viral GPs18, 54, 55, 56 and plausibly interaction with the lipid bilayer.15\n",

Polyphosphates/phosphonates proved to be virtually devoid of any antiviral activity in our screens but PVPA was a notable exception. This polymer scored well against nearly all pathogens except for ZIKV and Ebola, and revealed highest activity against HSV\u20102 and SARS. Finally, the very noticeable finding of this study is the overall \u201clead\u201d identified herein, namely PVBzA, a polycarboxylate with a hydrophobic backbone. This polymer exhibited superior (compared to other polymers) activity against each virus used in this work except for the nonenveloped AdV. Thus, a combination of anionic charge and hydrophobicity broadens the antiviral activity of a polymer and PVBzA represents a highly promising candidate for further preclinical studies and microbicide development.",

            "text": "In this work, we performed a screen of 14 polymers as inhibitory agents against 11 viral pathogens and provide a clear suggestive view on what makes a virus susceptible to polymer\u2010based inhibition and independently, a detailed analysis of which structural characteristics of the polymer make it a superior broad inhibitor of viral infectivity. We show that for enveloped viruses, at least one of the polymers can be found to have an antiviral effect\u2014illustrating that polymer\u2010assisted inhibition of viral infectivity is a rather universal phenomenon. Specific novelty of this work lies in our consideration of polyanions as antiviral agents against ZIKV, SARS, Ebola, and other pathogens that caused very recent pandemics. Further novelty is in that we implement the methodology of classic medicinal chemistry (systematic variation and extension of structure) into the design of macromolecular drugs. We believe that this aspect allowed us to identify the leads that are rather unexpected when considered in the overall context of macromolecular antiviral agents. Specifically, our data strongly suggest that hydrophobicity of the polymer backbone is pivotal for antiviral activity of the macromolecule. The overall lead of this study, poly(vinylbenzoic acid), PVBzA, suppressed infectivity of all the enveloped viruses studied in this work. Identified leads are promising candidates for microbicides and could be formulated as antiviral cr\u00e8mes, gels, sprays, paints, and coatings for diverse biomedical and biotechnological applications.8, 9, 10 Future work with the identified lead polymer(s) will focus on three aspects: We will clarify whether identified anti\u2010ZIKV leads prevent ZIKV infection via vaginal challenge in mice models to evaluate their potential for microbicide development. We will clarify in detail the mechanism of antiviral activity of polymers and identify if the viral envelope, the glycoproteins, or both is the cause of the essential polymer\u2013virus contact. And, we aim to optimize the antiviral effects of the lead polymers to achieve higher efficacy of the antiviral treatment, specifically through variation of the polymer architecture\u2014linear polymer, branched, hyperbranched or dendritic backbone, star polymers.",
