Thus, it provides a platform for domain experts, such as clinicians, virologists, and immunologists, to collaborate with data scientists and computational biologists for a rigorous model building, accurate data interpretation and drug repositioning. It offers a shared mental map to understand gender, age, and other susceptibility features of the host, disease progression, defence mechanisms, and response to treatment.
