Whenever possible, the impact should be minimized to ensure academic continuity and to maintain the efficiency of the health care system. At National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, we used the following guiding principles to develop systematic and holistic measures during the COVID-19 outbreak. We believe that these principles are useful for other medical schools developing contingency plans. Our approach to ensure academic continuity and quality was based on best practices in the following 4 areas:",

They also ensured systematic dissemination of information to all stakeholders. A onestop direct communication link was made available for any clarifications. These were important to develop the trust and confidence in the school and the shared information.",

Besides improving cleaning frequency and limiting movement to other health care institutions to prevent cross-cluster contamination, the collective effort of staff allowed rapid implementation of split-team work arrangements to preserve functional integrity.

Some staff involved students in the formulation of their contingency plans. Classes with more than 50 students and clinical placements were converted to online learning. The Zoom videoconference platform was used for a scenariobased station during admissions. Robustness of the assessment system was maintained through these principles 1 : infection control measures, (2) awareness of the way students were training and preparing for examinations, and (3) reduction of fallout due to fear of contracting COVID-19.",
