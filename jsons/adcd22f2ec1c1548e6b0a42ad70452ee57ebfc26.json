From analyses of these clones we draw the following conclusions: those of the viral DNA. Deletion of viral sequences is common and at least in two cases inversions have been found within the integrated viral DNA. t h i s configuration, a complete copy of v i r a l RNA i s positioned \"downstream i n a t r a n s c r i pt i o n a l sense\" from sequences present a t t h e 3' end of v i r a l RNA, suggesting t h e p o s s i b i l i t y t h a t the \"3 'I sequences might promote and r e g u l a t e t r a n s c r i p t i o n of v i r a l genes. nearly wild type levels at the permissive temperature. The level of phosphotyrosine in mutant infected cells rises rapidly upon shift from the restrictive to the permissive temperature, being substantially increased within 1 hour. Elevated levels of phosphotyrosine are not found inall p p 6 0 C itself has two phosphorylation sites. The level of phosphorylation at the site in the C-terminal half is affected by mutations in the SIC gene and it has been suggested that this site undergoes autophosphorylation. Consistent with these notions we have now found that this site is a phosphotyrosine. This is the first demonstration of the presence of phosphotyrosine in a protein labeled in vivo. Phosphot rosine is also present in a 50,000 dalton phosphoprotein which co-precipitates with p p 6 d from transformed chick cells. this protein is an intracellular substrate of ~~60%. It should clearly be possible to identify further substrates of p p 6 e on the basis of their containing phosphotyrosine. p p 6 e , the closely related cellular homoloque of viral p p 6 e , is present in all vertebrate cells. We have found that this normal cellular protein, obtained from both chicken and human cells, also phosphorylates tyrosine. This is additional evidence of the functional similarity of these structurally related proteins. It also demonstrates that all uninfected cells contain at least one protein kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine.",

Avian erythroblastosis (AEV) and avian myelocytomatosis virus strain 29 (MC29) have previously been shown to transform hematopoietic cells as well as fibroblasts in vitro even after clone purification of the respective viruses (1, 2) . Hematopoietic cells transformed by AEV have the properties of erythroblasts whereas MC29-transformed hematopoietic cells resemble macrophages (3) . Cloned fibroblasts transformed by these strains can bk distinguished by t h e pattern of transformation parameters they express (4) . The different biological properties of these two virus strains have been attributed to two new transformation specific sequences designated erb for AEV and mac for MC29 (5, 3) . W e have now been able to i s o l a x a mutant of A m ( t d 3 5 9 AEV) (5) and 3 mutants of MC29 (td4A MC29, tdlOC MC29 and tdlOH MC29) which have lost t h e x i l i t y to transform hematopoetic cells6vt which E v e retained t h e 3 i l i t y to transform fibroblasts. These mutants show a n increase in the mobility on SDS-PACE of their presumptive transforming a -erb fusion protein p75 AEV (7) and in the gag-mac fusion protein p l l 0 MC29 (8), respectively. I n s n , tryptic peptide analysis of these proteins revealed that they lack some of the transformation specific sequences and that they acquired in some cases additional =-specific sequences. Nearly all mice of the inbred AKR strain develop lymphoma before one year of age, but F1 mice from crosses of AKR with mice of various low-lymphoma strains develop the disease only at low incidences and/or much later in life in the large majority of such crosses that have been studied. It appears that one or more dominant gene transmitted from the low-lymphoma parental strain can suppress the development of the disease.",

In each case, the F v -1 resistance allele concomitantly suppressed some aspect of MuLV expression. We now report results from three more such crosses: AKR x DBA/1, AKR x C57L and C58 x DBA/2. Mice of segregating generations of these crosses were examined for their phenotypes at the Gpd-1 locus (closely linked to F p 1 ) and observed for occurrence of lymphoma. In none of the three crosses was there an association between Gpd-1 type and the disease, indicating that genes other than F v -1 suppress lymphoma in these cases. Moreover, no significant association between lymphoma and endogenous MuLV expression was detected in two of the three crosses, suggesting that the lymphoma-suppressing genes operate by affecting some lymphomaassociated factor other than endogenous MuLV. In only one of the three crosses was an association noted between lymphoma and H-2 type, although the H-2 complex has often proved to be a significant determinant of lymphoma susceptibility in other crosses. DNA extracted from several mouse clones transformed by chemical carcinogens has been applied to mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cultures, using the transfection technique of Graham and Van der Eb. Foci of transformed cells have been derived from such transfections. The transformants are able to grow in soft agar, and are tumorigenic in newborn mice. These results show that the phenotype of transformation can be transferred by naked DNA. They also indicate that in those cases the transforming allele is dominant.",

The biological roles of paramyxovirus envelope proteins (HN, F, and M) have been studied. F is involved in virus penetration, cell fusion and hemolysis, and is activated by cleavage by a host protease into 2 disulfide-bonded subunits (F1 and Fz). undergo multiple cycle replication, spread, and cause disease is dependent on the presence of an activating protease in the host; thus cleavage of F is a major determinant of pathogenesis. The N-terminus generated on F1 by cleavage is involved in its biological activity. The amim acid sequence in this region is hydrophobic and similar in Sendai, SV5 and NDV. Inan attempt to design specific inhibitors of virus replication, cell fusion and hemolysis, oligopeptides analogous to this region of F1 were synthesized and found to be specific and highly-active. Structure-activity studies showed that amino acid sequence, peptide length, and N-terminal carbobenzoxy group, C-terminal esterification, and steric configuration of amino acids affect inhibitory activity. Specific inhibition of influenza virus has also been obtained with peptides which resemble the N-terminal region of HAz. These results have provided information on the.mechanism of action of viral proteins in penetration and membrane fusion, and have also suggested a new approach to specific inhibition of viral replication.",

These results, coupled with findings by Norrby and co-workers that formalin-inactivated paramyxovirus vaccines did not elicit antihemolyzing antibodies, provide an explanation for vaccine failure, and for atypical and severe diseases, e.g., atypical measles, that occurred in individuals who received inactivated vaccines and were later infected.

A relatively high level of infectivity is continually present in the blood o f infected mice, but no disease symptoms are observed. Recently,we have isolated a variant of LDV which was associated with an Ib leukemia cell line that had been passaged in C58 mice for about 2 0 years. This LDV strain (C58-LDV) is able to produce a polioencephalomyelitis in C58 mice. Unique characteristics of both the host and the virus strain are required for the production o f this paralysis. LDV's have been previously isolated in a number of laboratories. but no technical methods existed for distinguishing differences between these isolates. The assessment of the ability to induce paralysis i n C58 mice and the measurement of antigenic crossreactivity by R I A have provided initial means for characterization. Persistently infected mice circulate virus complexed with antiviral antibody. These complexes are infectious. We have found that challenge of persistently infected mice with homologous virus results in an increase in the level of antiviral antibody. The C58-LDV appears to be more immunogenic than other LDV's, since it elicits a 4D-fold increase in antibody as compared to a 5-fold increase elicited by other LDV's. We have recently observed that C58-LDV i s capable of replicating in neurons as assessed by EM analysis of spinal cord lesions in C58 mice and by infection of CNS cells in culture. Macrophage-like cells had been thought to be the only cells replicating LDV. Levels of infectivity and antiviral Ab in the CSF are being evaluated to determine the abilities of the various LDV strains to enter the CNS of C58 and control mice.",

A protein kinase activity, having the unusual specificity of phosphorylating tyrosine, is associated with polyoma T antigen immunoprecipitates. We are studying the effect of Sixty-five clones of rat cells (Fisher F-111 and NFX) obtained by mixed infections between hr-t (NG-18, 11-5, SD-15) and ts-a (ts-25D, ts-616, ts-48, ts-a) mutants have been studied in terms of the T-antigens expressed and the nature of the virus obtained by fusion with permissive cells or revealed by Southern blotting. Viral proteins are expressed both from the hr-t and ts-a alleles. All clones analyzed express middle and little t-antigens in both Fisher and NFZ clones. Thirty percent of NRK and about 10% of the Fisher clones have either no or a thermolabile expression of large T-antigen. Virus can be rescued from the majority of the Fisher clones and from a minority of the NRK clones. Both hr-t and ts-a alleles are rescued. In addition, wild type recombinants are observed in the majority of the Fisher rat clones. are testing the hypothesis that wild type genomes arise by packaging DNA from concatemers containing hr-t and ts-a alleles in tandem configuration. The SV40 tsA58 transformed m u s e clone A21 displays a temperature sens&tive transformed phenotype, but colonies can be obtained in soft agar at 40 C wlth a frequency of less than 1%. Clonal derivatives of A21, isolated by growth in soft agar at 4OoC, were analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage and Southern blot hybridization. In 10 of 12 clones examined, the conversion of A21 cells to anchorage independent growth at 4OoC is accompanied by the acquisition of new sites of integrated SV40. By using the Bgl I1 endonuclease which lacks specificity for SV40, it was shown that the parental A21 clone contains SV40 sequences in 9 kb and 15 kb fragments of cellular DNA. clonal derivatives generally retain the 9 kb and 15 kb integration sites but possess additional SV40 insertions within Bgl I1 fragments of 15 to 25 kb. The viral DNA monomer in both the 9 kb and 15 kb Bgl I1 inserts is a deletion fragment of 3 . 8 kb which is arranged in a tandem head to tail fashion in the cellular DNA. These results suqgest that the change in biological expression of the transformed phenotype may be accompanied by the rearrangement of integrated SV40 specific sequences.",

Interferon (IF) affects the production of murine leukemia viruses in chronically infected cells. In some systems, IF treatment inhibited virus release while in others, the virions released were deficient in infectivity. To determine whether the observed differences in IF effect were dependent on the infecting virus or the host cell, a clone of Maloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was used to establish persistent infections in several mouse cell lines. All of these cell lines were capable of establishing an antiviral state, as shown by resistance to challenge by EMC virus in the standard CPE test after IF treatment. Our data indicated that IF treatment had no effect on the production of M-MuLV in NIH 3T3 cells, as determined by reverse transcriptase activity and infectivity of virus released into the culture fluid. cells resulted in significant decreases in the reverse transcriptase activity and infectivity of released virions. Additionally, preliminary data indicated that low levels of non-infectious particles were released from one of these clones after IF treatment. The We have developed a technique for the isolation and characterization of newly transcribed murine leuke ia viral RNA in chronically infected cells. Cellular RNA was pulse labeled with H-uridine and virus specific sequences were annealed with an excess of mercurated complementary DNA. Based on the affinity between mercurated cDNA and sulfhydryl-Sepharose. the hybrid was specifically selected by affinity column chromatography. The specificity of this method was dependent on the purity of the cDNA, and it was necessary to remove non-viral sequences from the cDNA in order to isolate virus-specific RNA. The kinetics of cytoplasmic viral DNA synthesis was followed by thymidine labeling of MLV-infected cells. An increased rate of synthesis is observed up to 3.5 hours after infection followed by a decrease. Infection of interferon-treated cells results in a reduced rate of viral DNA synthesis. Preliminary results show that a cellular factor, probably a protein, is involved in the synthesis of viral DNA. Its amount is increased in infected cells.",

In some animals the disease occurred as episodic paresis of the hind limbs with near total recovery between periods of paralysis. Virus could not be demonstrated in lesions by immunofluorescence or isolated by cocultivatlon of spinal cord with monkey kidney cells. The strain of virus used was distinctive in that it contained high levels of a naturally occurring viral variant, differing from typlcal measles in several ways. In cultures of monkey kidney cells the variant induces cell rounding and swelling rather than the usual measles syncytia formation. In acutely infected neonate hamster brain the variant grows less readily than does the syncytiagenic form of the virus and is less encephalitogenic. The variant has a decreased buoyant density in potassium tartrate gradients compared to typical measles, yet it expresses the same major structural polypeptides. However, the relative amounts of the two viral envelope glycoproteins are altered in the variant. The variant can be cloned and titered independently of the syncytiagenic type of virus, and is therefore unlikely to be a defective form of typical measles virus.

Cells infected with the murine coronavirus strain JHM shut-off host cell protein synthesis and synthesize a number of virus-specific proteins including two structural proteins, p60 and p23. The poly A RNAs encoding p60 and p23 can be isolated from the cytoplasm of infected cells and translated in both reticulocyte and L-cell cell-free systems to give authentic products which can be identified by specific immunoprecipitation and tryptic peptide fingerprinting. The RNA encoding p60 sediments in sucrose-formamide gradients at 17s and that encoding p23 is clearly seperable and sediments at 19s. Both RNAs can be specifically released from infected cell polysomes and are therefore physiological mRNAs and they both constitute a large proportion of the viral RNA synthesized late in infection. Our interpretation of this data is that these RNAs represent two subgenomic coronavirus JHM mRNAs each of which encodes a different structural protein of the virus and if correct shows that the replication strategy of coronaviruses contrasts with other well-characterized non-transforming positive-stranded RNA animal viruses.",

Cheley and Robert Anderson, Dept. of Microbiology d Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada Studies in our laboratory provide biochemical evidence f o r the derivation of a highly neurotropic (JHM) strain from the more prevalent and primarily hepatotropic (MHV3) strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Both strains code for three major primary gene products: a large glycoprotein, p'lBO', a basic, phosphorylated protein, p'56' and a low molecular weight protein, ~'22'. Proteins p'56' and p'22' give rise t o product polypeptides p'50' and p'24' respectively through post-translational modification mechanisms. All polypeptides of JHM have only slightly lower apparent molecular weights in SDS PAGE than the corresponding ones of MHV3. Comparison of polypeptides from MHV3 and JHM by proteolytic peptide mapping shows a high degree of structural relatedness between the two strains. Discrete peptide differences are. however, detected. Since virus-specified tissue tropism is connoonly determined by structural characteristics of viral polypeptides, it is suspected that the observed peptide differences between MHV3 and JHM may contribute to the biological differences exhibited by the two strains.

This inhibition occurred at 33OC and 37,OC and affected both the Edmonston and Joy wild type measles strains. Synthesia of the nonglycosylatsd viral proteins (L, P, NP, M) appeared to be normal in the presence of the drug, while changes were observed in the synthesis o f H, the large viral glycoprotein. Particles released from TM-treated cultures lacked the normal H protein, but did contain a polypeptide, termed p90, which migrated more slowly than H on SDS-PAGE. p90 was also found in particles released from cultures infected in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucosc. Partial protease digests indicated that the p90 polypeptide might be related to H. The anomalously slow migration of p90 suggests that there may be proteolytic processing of the H protein.

The transcription of Cytoplasmic Polyhedrosis Virus (CPV) of Bombyx mori, a ten-segmented dsRNA virus, was investigated. Efficient in vitro synthesis of CPV mRNA was facilitated by the presence of sodium acetate, high concentrations of ribonucleoside triphosphates and proteinase K. Under optimal conditions, transcription was maintained for more than 24 hr, resulting in large quantities of full-size mRNAs which were active in cell-free translation. mixture of CPV mRNAs consisting of ten RNA species was resolved into nine discrete bands by agarose gel electrophoresis with 7 M urea. identified by hybridizing the separated, 32P-labeled mRNAs to a mixture of genome WAS. mRNA hybridized uniquely with its corresponding genome RNA segment in order of decreasing size. quantities by weight but different molar amounts of each of the separated mRNA species.

Messenger RNA synthesis in vitro by CPV is stimulated by the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (Furuichi, Nuc. Acids Res. 1:801, 1974) . effect by AdoMet is probably at the initiation step of RNA synthesis. mine the important structural features of the AdoMet molecule required for the stimulation, analogs of AdoMet have been tested for their ability to promote RNA synthesis and to inhibit AdoMet-stimulated methylation. Several potent inhibitors of cellular and viral methyltransferases, e.g., S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), 3-deaza AdoMet, 7-deaza AdoMet, 7-deaza AdoHcy, and the antibiotic Sinefungin, inhibit methylation of CPV mR\", but stimulate mRNA synthesis as effectively as AdoMet. In contrast, most of the analogs which fail to inhibit CPV methyltransferase also fail to stimulate CPV mRNA synthesis. Structural features of AdoMet needed for efficient mRNA synthesis apparently coincide with those recognized by CPV methyltransferase. recognizing protein) in CPV transcriptional complexes activates the RNA polymerase through an AdoMet-mediated allosteric conformational change resulting in the mRNA synthesis and the formation of the methylated cap structure. 07110 and 2University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045",

The disease in calves is seasonal although the mechanism by which the virus persists from season to season is not known. Most isolates of bovine rotavirus are cytolytic for BSC-1 cells. Infection causes breakdown of host DNA and cessation of host macromolecular synthesis followed by death of the cell and release of infectious virus.

The cloned Ha-MuSV DNA is therefore permuted w i t h respect t o i t s structure in virus-transformed mammalian cells. Both intact and Eco RI digested x.Ha-MuSV DNA induced foci of transformed mouse c e l l s w i t h similar efficiency. Transformed cell l i n e s were established from independently induced foci. Superinfection with a helper-independent virus rescued Ha-MuSV with low efficiency (<lo3 ffu/ml) from a l l lines transformed by intact X.Ha-MuSV DKA and from most lines transformed by Eco RI digested DNA. Virus was rescued with h i g h efficiency (>lo6 ffu/ml) from the remaining l i n e s transformed by digested DNA and from a l l l i n e s non-productively transformed by Ha-MuSV virus. Southern blotting of high molecular weight DNA from low-rescue lines indicated t h a t y contained Ha-MuSV only i n the permuted orientation, while high-rescue l i n e s transformed by Eco RI digested DNA contained a head-to-tail dimer of the cloned viral DNA. All transformed lines contained high levels of both the Ha-MuSV p21 and of RNA sequences derived from the 5' side of the viral Eco RI s i t e . Only the high-rescue l i n e s contained high levels of RNA sequences from the 3' side of the viral Eco RI s i t e ; the low-rescue lines contained l i t t l e or no RNA of t h i s class. These results suggested t h a t , i n contrast t o Rous sarcoma virus and Moloney-MuSV, the transforming region (and the sequences coding f o r the p21) of Ha-MuSV is contained within the 5' half of t h e viral genome.

Although normal cellular enzymes are apparently responsible for the entire glycosylation of membrane glycoproteins of lipid-enveloped animal viruses, a role for viral genes encoding these membrane polypeptides has been previously demonstrated in canparisons of viral glycopeptides from different viruses replicated in the same host cell type (Sefton, J.Virol. 17: 85, 1976). lectin-resistant cell lines indicates that a virus can acquire carbohydrate structures for its glycoproteins which are unique and not found in significant quantities in the membrane glycoproteins of the uninfected host cell or in the glycoproteins of other viruses grown in the same host cell type. presunably result fran alterations in the trimming and processing of the cMrmOn, large oligomannosyl precursor structure in virus-infected cells (Hunt et al., Proc.

Barbara Weiss, Stephan Monroe and Sondra Schlesinger, Yashington University Medical School, St. Louis, I 4 0 63110. Persistently infected BHK cell cultures were established with wild type Sindbis virus in the presence of defective interfering (01) particles. These cells have been in culture for over one year and continuously release a small plaque. RNAtemperature sensitive mutant as well as a variable spectrum of DI particles containing many discrete size classes of RN4. The cloned infectious viral mutant can initiate persistency in the absence of detectable DI particles. Prolonged cultivation of these cells, hwever, results in the appearance of and enrichment for DI particles. The early. DI negative cultures are resistant to superinfection with Sindbis virus, but are susceptible to vescular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). When these cells becane DI positive they acquire additional resistance to SFV, but not to VSV. This resistance appears to result from heterologous interference by Sindbis DI particles. Our data support an important role for DI particles in initiating alphavirus persistency with a highly virulent virus. By extending the life of infected cells, they permit the selection of a variant with reduced virulence. This variant alone can reinitiate a carrier state. The evolution o f DI particles in cells infected with this mutant may reflect both the ease with which DI particles are generated in BHK cells and a possible selective advantage such dually infected cells would have. 653 CHAWCTEPIZATIOB OF TIE I!YDROF'HOBIC TAILS Of THE SIND13IS VIRION GLYCOPROTEINS.

T-Ag related surface antigens were detected on living SV4D transformed cells as well as on cells infected with adeno2-SV40-hybrid virus by imunofluorescence microscopy and by an 1251-protein A binding assay. The sensitivity of both methods could be increased by careful fixation of the cells with formaldehyde at O D C. Upon permeabilization of formalin fixed cells, in addition to T-Ag related surface antigen nuclear T-Ag could be visualized by a double staining technique in all the SV40 transformed cell lines analyzed. In rat cells transformed by the temperature-sensitive SV40 A-gene mutant tsA 28.3 both antigens were detectable at the permissive temperature. Upon shift to the non-permissive temperature the expression of both antigens decreased simultaneously. In these cells the expression of both SV40 T-Ag related surface antigen and nuclear T-Ag was strongly correlated with the synthesis of the T-Ag polypeptide, suggesting that both nuclear T-Ag and T-Ag related surface antigen are products of the SV40 A-gene. Altogether, these data indicate that T-Ag related antigens are present on the surface of SV40 transformed cells and might participate in the formation of SV40 TSTA.",

Similar observations have been made for the DNA of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) in Ada-transformed hamster cells. In Adl2-transformed hamster cells and in AdlZ-induced rat brain tumor cells, an inverse correlation exists between the level of methylation of certain segments of the viral genome and the extent to which these segments are expressed as messenger RNA. Regions of the integrated Ad12 genome, which are silent are completely methylated, regions which are transcribed into mRNA are much less extensively methylated. The DNA in virions of Ad2 or Ad12 does not seem to be methylated (Gunthert et al., 1976). When human cells are productively infected with Ad2 or when hamster cells are abortively infected with Ad12, the parental viral DNA purified from isolated nuclei of such infected cells is not strongly methylated,except perhaps at very early times postinfection. Investigations continue to determine in which way methylation of DNA could influence the expression of eukaryotic genes. (Supported by the DFG through SFB74).",

Knipe, William Batterson, and Bernard Roizman. Univ. of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 The mutant HSV-1 (HFEM) tsB7 fails to express any detectable viral polypeptides and fails to inhibit host cell protein synthesis in infected cells maintained at the non-permissive temperature, The mutant can complement the growth of other viruses and therefore can enter doubly infected cells. The mutation maps in the middle of the L component in or near genes coding for virion structural proteins and near a previously mapped function regulating inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. Abundant transcripts and mRNA from this region accumulate only after DNA synthesis and thus the gene appears to code for a late protein. All of our data are consistent with the lesion being a defect in a virion structural protein required for expression o \u20ac all early viral gene products and for inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. This mutation defines a new early stage of infection prior to expression of any viral gene products at which the replication of herpes simplex virus can be regulated. 735 I D -CLOWING OF THE HUMAN CYTOMEiALoVIRUS GENOME (STRAIN AD169).

The blood was separated into a mononuclear, a polymorphonuclear and a redblood cell fraction. CMV could be isolated from blood cells from 44%. Most commonly the polymorphonuclear cell fraction contained virus, 38%. The mononuclear cell fraction yielded virus in 25%. The antibody activity in complement fixation (CF) and the presence of antibodies against early viral antigens in immunofluorescence (CMV-EA) has been investigated. Antibodies against CMV-EA did regularly appear and reached high titers but decreased more rapidly than CF antibody. CMV isolation from blood cells seems to be a common phenomenon in renal transplant patlents. Leukocytes may be one of the sources of latent CMV albeit harbouring it in a low frequency. G.

Ile have developed a means of directly visualizing s i t e s of restriction enzyme cleavage on uncut DNA using the electron microscope. With classic surCace spreadinq microscopy, potential s i t e s of cleavaoe o f a restriction enzyme ( t o which specific tags had been synthesized) are made visible on the intact DYA by tCIe presence of small marker RX4 molecules. This technique provides a way of direct restriction mapping with very large and heterogeneous DIIAs, and requires only small quantities oc DNA, an advantage in systems sucq as the non-producing EBV lines which have only a few copies of the viral genom per cell. Furthermore, isolated RNA transcripts nay be included in the maoping procedure and their location identified relative t o nearby restriction s i t e s .

Starting at the left-end of the genome, the cloned fragments comprise a continuous 20,500 nucleotide base-pair stretch of DNA, the terminal half of which is repeated at the right end of the genome. RNAs encoded by the region of interest have been resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, immobilized on paper, and mapped using 32P-labeled DNA restriction fragments. Early in infection, discrete areaa of the DNA are transcribed to produce RNAs of 0.5 to 1.3 Kb which can be translated in vitro. Three early mRNAs and their translation products have been napped within the repeated region and seven within the unique. terminal 3,000 nucleotide base pairs of the genome. Although both strands of the DNA are transcribed early in infection, the majority are encoded within the leftward-reading strand.",

Iverson and John K. Rose, Tumor Virology Laboratory, The Salk Institute, Post Office Box 85800, San Diego, California 92138 We are examining why the five separate mRNA species of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are produced in decreasing amounts as transcription proceeds along the single-stranded RNA genome. To study this transcription attenuation we have identified recombinant plasmids containing sequences derived from the 5 ' and 3' ends of four of the five VSV mRNAs (N, NS, M and G). we have used these plasmids in DNA excess filter hybridizations to study the amount of transcription occurring at both ends of each gene. Our results confirm and extend an earlier report of decreasing molar yields of each mRNA species corresponding to the gene order (N-NS-M-GL) and also confirm the sequential nature of VSV transcription. Additional experiments suggest that transcription attenuation is predominantly localized to the gene termini or the intergenic regions. 748 ANALYSIS OF VSV GENE, INTERGENE, AND GLYCOPROTEIN STRUCTURE USING RECOMBINANT PLASUDS, ~o h n K.

Seifried, Bureau of Biologics, Food 6 Drug Administration, Bethesda, M) 20205 SSPE virus isolates which remain cell-restricted in culture contain polypeptides equivalent to those of measles virus with the exception of the 70K phosphoprotein (P) and the 38K matrix protein (M) when analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoretic analysis shows that these proteins are not detectable in purified virions nor in extracts of cells infected by theae SSPE viruses. However, when poly A-containing messenger RNA is selected by dT-cellulose chromatography from the cytoplasm of cells infected by these viruses and used to direct cell-free translation in a reticulocyte lysate system. both M and P polypeptides, in addition to other polypeptides seen i n the analogous experiment conducted with measles virus mRNA, are synthesized. Another polypeptide, which appears to be a nonstmctural phosphorylated form of M, is synthesized when the reticulocyte lysate translation system i s programed by either measles virus or SSPE virus mRNA's. This polypeptide i s also found in cells infected by measles or SSPE viruses, but not in purified virions. These data suggest a model in which deficiency of M and P proteins in SSPE virions may be related to a block in the posttranslational conversion of the phosphorylated form of M to that form which i s present within purified virions. Though there i s no detectable difference in the size of the mRNA for this phosphorylated protein nor of the polypeptide synthesized from it, there may be small base sequence differences in the mRNA resulting i n a change in primary andlor secondary structure of the protein which prevents this conversion.

The cell lines are tumorigenic in nude mice, although they have a normal diploid karotype. Of thirty cultures examined, only three were found to produce infectious virus. The other cultures, while restricting virus production, expressed viral nucleic acids and proteins to varying degrees: some cultures contained complete provirus and expressed viral RNA and some viral proteins: others contained much lower levels of RNA and protein. and some contained no detectable viral information. To determine whether the low levels of viral RNA in some of the cell populations was due to low level expression or to expression in only some cells, the individual cells in eight viral initiated cultures were examined for the presence of SiSVlSiSAV RNA. In a virus-releasing cell line, essentially all the cells were positive; 3-30% of the cells in four cultures and 75X of the cells in a culture after passage through a nude mouse showed viral RNA expression. Two cultures contained less than 0.1% positive cells; and one culture was completely negative for expression of viral RNA. The restricted expression of viral information in these lymphoblast lines affords a model for the effect of retroviruses on human hematopoietlc cells and the involvement of retroviruses in the initiation and maintenance of the transformed state. 796 TRANSCRIPTION IN ASV TRANSFORMED MAMMALIAN CELLS AND PHENOTYPIC REVERTANTS.

However, such cells can be easily infected with and rapidly replicate many types of viruses including Coxsackie 83, mouse hepatitis, Sindbis, Semliki Forest, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Pichinde, vesicular stomatitis, herpes simplex type 1 and herpes simplex type 2 to the same extent as do murine F12 teratoma cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts, all of which express the H-2 determinants. In contrast, F9 and PCC4 cells a r e not productively infected with murim cytomegalovirus, whereas F12 and mouse embryo fibroblast cells are. The undifferentiated pleuripotential PCC4 cell line could be induced to differentiate in vitro by treatment with N,Ndimethylacetamide. Further, undifferentiated PCC4 cells which did not express viral antigen or release infectious virus following infection'with MCMV upon differentiation now express viral antigens and release infectious virus. Murine CMV DNA was detected in undifferentiated cells but was amplified 4 t o 5-fold (4 copieslcell) in differentiated cells.
