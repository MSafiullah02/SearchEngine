            "text": "In November 2002, an atypical pneumonia, characterized by progressive respiratory failure and death in approximately 10% of cases, emerged in Guangdong Province, Southern China 1.\u2022\u2022, 2., 3.. Carlo Urbani, a WHO specialist in infectious diseases, was the first to recognize that this disease was unusual and that it represented a major threat to public health. Together with the Vietnamese authorities and WHO, he immediately introduced effective infection control measures that eventually stopped the further spread of the disease in Vietnam. Sadly, he would not survive to see this success. He contracted the disease and died as a result on March 29, 2003. The disease was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV, was rapidly identified as the etiological agent 4., 5., 6., 7.\u2022. The rapid spread of the disease to neighboring regions and other countries prompted the WHO to issue a global alert on March 13, 2003. By the end of the epidemic, in July 2003, more than 8400 SARS cases and around 800 deaths due to SARS had been recorded worldwide. SARS-CoV is only distantly related to other human coronaviruses, such as 229E (coronavirus group 1) and OC43 (coronavirus group 2), which are known to cause the common cold and, in only a few cases, are associated with lower respiratory tract illness and diarrhea [8]. There is a large body of seroepidemiological data suggesting that SARS-CoV had not previously been endemic in humans 6., 7.\u2022. Conversely, there is some initial evidence that at least a small proportion of healthy people in Hong Kong may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-related viruses up to two years before the SARS outbreak [9]. It is generally believed that SARS-CoV evolved from an animal coronavirus that recently crossed the species barrier. This hypothesis is supported by data published by Guan and co-workers [10\u2022\u2022], who isolated SARS-CoV-like viruses from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog that were sold on a life-animal market in Guangdong, China. Significantly, an increased seroprevalence of SARS-CoV was observed in people trading with these animals. The potential for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV is also illustrated by the fact that a whole range of animals, including cats, ferrets, mice and macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV 4., 11., 12.. The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV in nature remains to be identified.",

The remaining twelve ORFs encode the four structural proteins, S, M, N and E, and eight accessory proteins that are not likely to be essential in tissue culture but may provide a selective advantage in the infected host.

The S protein forms typical petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion. It is heavily glycosylated and consists of three domains, the external N-terminal domain with its conserved S1 and S2 subdomains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminus. The cellular receptor of several group 1 coronaviruses is aminopeptidase N, a zinc metalloprotease [18], whereas mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (group 2) uses carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules as a cellular receptor [19]. Recently, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was demonstrated to be a functional cellular receptor of SARS-CoV [20\u2022\u2022]. The minimal binding domain of the SARS-CoV S protein was delimited to the S1 residues 318\u2013510 [21] and antibodies specific for the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV S protein were shown to neutralize SARS-CoV infection [22\u2022].",

            "text": "Following S protein-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane (see Update) and release of the viral genome RNA into the cytoplasm of the infected cell [23], SARS-CoV genome expression begins with the (cap-dependent) translation of the genomic RNA (mRNA 1; Figure 1). The translation product that is encoded by ORF1a is a protein of 4382 amino acid residues and is called polyprotein 1a (pp1a). Due to ribosomal frameshifting into the \u20131 reading frame, occurring just upstream of the ORF1a translation stop codon, pp1a can be extended with ORF1b-encoded sequences to yield the 7073-residue polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab). The signal mediating the frameshift consists of the \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence, 13392UUUAAAC13398, and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure [15\u2022\u2022]. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are extensively processed by viral proteinases 15.\u2022\u2022, 24., 25.\u2022 to yield a huge multi-subunit protein complex called \u2018viral replicase-transcriptase\u2019. Together with a number of cellular factors, this protein complex mediates the replication of the viral genome and the transcription of a nested set of eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs [15\u2022\u2022]. Each of the sg mRNAs carries a 72-nucleotide, 5\u2032-terminal leader sequence that is derived from the 5\u2032-end of the genome [15\u2022\u2022]. The leader sequence is acquired by a unique mechanism that involves discontinuous synthesis of sg minus strands and is dependent on cis-active RNA elements, known as \u2018transcription-regulating sequences\u2019 (TRSs) 26., 27.. The TRSs of SARS-CoV have a common core sequence, ACGAAC [15\u2022\u2022], that, by complementary base-pairing, assists in the transfer of the nascent minus strand to the TRS (leader TRS), located downstream of the 5\u2032-leader sequence on the genomic RNA [26]. Besides complementary base-pairing, the transfer of the nascent minus strand to the 5\u2032-leader TRS is thought to involve protein\u2013protein interactions that keep the 5\u2032-end of the genome in close proximity to the site of ongoing minus-strand synthesis. The current model of coronavirus sg RNA synthesis further suggests that, if the minus strand polymerase encounters attenuation signals that cause it to stall, the genome\u2019s 5\u2032-end would provide an alternative template, allowing minus-strand synthesis to be continued and completed [27]. The resulting antileader-containing minus-strand RNAs are subsequently used as templates for (continuous) plus-strand synthesis of sg mRNAs. Analysis of SARS-CoV intracellular RNA synthesis, along with sequence analysis of the 5\u2032-ends of SARS-CoV-specific RNAs confirmed the joining of noncontiguous genomic sequences in all the sg mRNAs and allowed reliable predictions on functional ORFs in the SARS-CoV genome [15\u2022\u2022]. Thus, the SARS-CoV RNAs 2 to 9 are predicted to encode the four structural proteins S, M, N and E, as well as eight SARS-CoV-specific proteins with currently unknown functions. The sg RNAs are either functionally monocistronic (mRNAs 2, 4, 5 and 6) or bicistronic (mRNAs 3, 7, 8 and 9) (Figure 1) 15.\u2022\u2022, 16.\u2022\u2022.",

            "text": "The production of a complex and diverse set of RNA molecules by SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses (and nidoviruses) is linked to an unparalleled complexity of the replicative polyproteins, which are anchored to intracellular membranes and contain a variety of enzymatic activities 16.\u2022\u2022, 28.. Coronaviruses control the activities of their replicative proteins by co- and post-translational processing of the nonstructural polyproteins [24] and ribosomal frameshifting [29] \u2013 thus ensuring a specific molar ratio between ORF1a- and ORF1b-encoded proteins. Generally, coronaviruses employ two papain-like proteases, PL1pro and PL2pro, to process the N-proximal regions of the replicative polyproteins at three sites. By contrast, SARS-CoV encodes only one papain-like protease, the activity of which has been established recently [15\u2022\u2022]. The SARS-CoV enzyme is a PL2pro orthologue, which, in contrast to most other coronavirus papain-like proteases, features a narrow substrate specificity. This might improve the potential for identifying selective inhibitors [15\u2022\u2022]. In common with other coronavirus papain-like proteases [30], the SARS-CoV PL2pro contains a putative Zn-finger structure, connecting the \u03b1- and \u03b2-domains of a papain-like fold. Based on HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E) and EAV (equine arteritis virus) data, the Zn-finger is predicted to be required for the proteolytic activity of PL2pro and may have distinct functions in coronavirus sg RNA synthesis 30., 31.. The central and C-terminal regions of the replicative polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, are cleaved by a chymotrypsin-like protease that, because of its distant relationship with the 3C proteases of picornaviruses, is named 3C-like protease, 3CLpro\n[24]. The 3CLpro plays a pivotal role in coronavirus polyprotein processing and also releases the key replicative functions of the virus, such as RdRp and helicase; therefore, it is also called the coronavirus main protease, Mpro\n24., 28.. Both in terms of function and structure, it represents the best-characterized coronavirus enzyme to date. In common with the 3CLpros of group 1 coronaviruses 25.\u2022, 32., 33., 34., the SARS-CoV 3CLpro employs a catalytic Cys\u2013His dyad and has a three-domain structure, in which the N-terminal, chymotrypsin-like two-\u03b2-barrel fold (domains I and II) is connected by a 16-residue loop to the C-terminal domain III, consisting of five \u03b1-helices 25.\u2022, 35.\u2022. Biochemical data, as well as crystal structure information and NMR data, consistently implicate the 16-residue loop in substrate-binding 25.\u2022, 34., 35.\u2022, 36.. In the polyprotein, the 3CLpro is flanked by hydrophobic, probably membrane-spanning domains. At present, it is not clear whether the 3CLpro cleaves itself in cis or trans from the replicase polyprotein precursor; however, once released, the trans-cleavage activity seems to depend on 3CLpro dimerization that mainly involves the enzyme\u2019s N-terminus, domain II and, in particular, the \u03b1-helical domain III 25.\u2022, 35.\u2022, 36., 37.. Several intermolecular and intramolecular interactions appear to be tailor-made to keep the enzyme in a conformation that is capable of cleaving substrates in trans and preventing self-inactivation by backfolding of the chain termini.",

Despite conservation of the P4, P2, P1, and P1\u2032 positions among coronavirus 3CLpro substrates, there is preliminary evidence to suggest a significant structural flexibility for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site, which may even lead to differential binding modes of specific peptidyl inhibitors to group 1 [(porcine) transmissible gastroenteritis virus; TGEV] versus group 2 (SARS-CoV) coronavirus 3CLpros 25.\u2022, 35.\u2022. Both the flexibility of the active site and the data from another study, which recently suggested that the P\u2032 residues (despite little conservation) also contribute significantly to the substrate-binding by SARS-CoV 3CLpro, might have important implications for the design of protease inhibitors [36].",

However, there is a lack of structural and biochemical information on any coronavirus RdRp and structural predictions are complicated by the fact that the coronavirus RdRps are significantly diverged from cellular and viral RNA polymerases. Recently, a structure model was built for the catalytic domain of the SARS-CoV RdRp [39\u2022]. The model provides first insights into the active site of the protein and also enables conclusions to be drawn about the properties of potential nucleoside analog inhibitors of coronavirus RdRps. Thus, it was proposed that potential nucleoside analog inhibitors should contain groups at their 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 positions that are capable of making hydrogen-bonding interactions with RdRp residues 623 and 691. Furthermore, to avoid steric conflicts in the binding to the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 positions, the potential nucleoside inhibitors should possess the C3\u2032 endo sugar puckering conformation. Clearly, direct structural information is highly desirable for the development of effective inhibitors of this key enzyme.",

These include a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN), a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MT), an ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) [47], and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD). Four of the activities are conserved in all coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, supporting their essential role in the coronaviral life cycle [16\u2022\u2022]. The fact that ExoN (nsp14), NendoU (nsp15) and 2\u2032-O-MT (nsp16) are arranged in pp1ab as a single protein block downstream of the RdRp and helicase domains (Figure 2) suggests a cooperation of these activities in the same metabolic pathway. As an initial clue to the potential functions of the nsp14\u2013nsp16 proteins, an interesting parallel to cellular RNA processing pathways was noted by Snijder and co-workers [16\u2022\u2022]. Thus, cellular homologs of coronavirus nsp14\u201316 cleave mRNAs to produce small nucleolar RNAs that guide specific 2\u2032-O-ribose methylations on ribosomal RNA 48., 49.. The activities of the predicted coronavirus enzymes and their viral and/or cellular substrates remain to be established. ADRP and CPD, this being conserved only in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, excluding SARS-CoV, were also proposed to cooperate in a common (but currently unknown) pathway. This hypothesis is based on the fact that cellular homologs of CPD and ADRP mediate two consecutive steps in the downstream processing of ADP-ribose 1\u2033,2\u2033 cyclic phosphate (Appr>p), a side product of tRNA splicing [50].",

The differential conservation pattern of RNA processing activities among the nidovirus families and genera suggests a functional hierarchy for these enzymes, with NendoU playing a major role. It might also reflect subtle differences in the RNA synthesis mechanisms used by various nidovirus families and/or differential interactions of nidovirus nonstructural proteins with host cell functions. Alternatively, the extra functions that are encoded by coronaviruses and toroviruses (and, to a lesser extent, roniviruses) might be required to replicate the extremely large (~30 kb) RNA genomes of these viruses. Thus, the predicted 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease, ExoN, has been speculated to be involved in recombination or repair mechanisms that may be required for the life cycle of corona-, toro-, and roniviruses but may be dispensable for the much smaller arteriviruses [16\u2022\u2022].",

Analogous to other type-1 fusion glycoproteins, the formation of the six-helix bundle has been suggested to contribute to a conformational change that occurs in the S protein, following receptor binding, to form a fusion-active core that brings the viral and host cell membranes into close proximity, leading to the fusion between these membranes. Importantly, peptides derived from the HR2 sequence were shown to block SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells, suggesting a potential approach to the development of drugs for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infections 59.\u2022, 60.\u2022.",

The 14 ORFs are expressed from the genome RNA (mRNA 1) and a nested set of sg mRNAs (mRNAs 2\u20139) that all have a common leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome. The complement of this leader sequence (\u2018antileader\u2019) is fused to the 3\u2032 ends of nascent minus-strands by discontinuous RNA synthesis, which involves transcription-regulating sequences, the positions of which in the genome RNA are indicated here (see main text for details). The key functions that are required for the replication of the viral genome RNA and the synthesis of sg RNAs are encoded by the SARS-CoV replicase gene, comprising ORFs 1a and 1b. Expression of ORF1b sequences requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift into the \u20131 reading frame during translation of the genome RNA, which occurs just upstream of the ORF1a translation stop codon.",
