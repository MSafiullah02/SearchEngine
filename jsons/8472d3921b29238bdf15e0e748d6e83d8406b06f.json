The initial R0 varied greatly among States, with the highest R0 = 8.3 in New York State. The variation in initial R0 was strongly correlated with the peak daily death count among States, showing that the initial R0 anticipates subsequent challenges in controlling epidemics. Furthermore, the variation in initial R0 implies different needs for public health measures. Finally, the States that relaxed public health measures early were not those with the lowest risks of resurgence, highlighting the need for science to guide public health policies.",

Because r may change rapidly in response to actions that are taken to reduce disease transmission, we used a time-varying autoregressive model that allows for the rate of spread to change through time, r(t). Other models take a related approach. For example, the Imperial College of London model (2, 3) assumes that the rate of spread changes immediately following actions taken by governments. Our approach differs, because we instead allow r(t) to change as inferred from the data: we do not make a priori assumptions about when these changes occur. Thus, we use an approach to analyzing time series in which the parameters of the time series model themselves can change through time, with the rate of change estimated from the data to give the best fit, as measured by the maximum likelihood.

To account for this, the time-series model includes increased uncertainty (measurement error) when the mean counts of deaths or cases are low. These low counts also mean that there is greater uncertainty in the estimates of r(t). Standard (asymptotic) approaches often have poor statistical properties (type I errors, correctly calculated confidence intervals) when sample sizes are small (7). Therefore, we use bootstrapping (8) in which simulation time series are reconstructed to share the same pattern as the observed time series; a large number of simulated time series are then fit using the same statistical model as used to fit the original data. This bootstrapping procedure thus gives estimates and confidence intervals for model fit to the real data.",

Our rationale is that, for statistical fitting, it is better to keep the model as simple as possible, rather than \"building in\" assumptions about the processes of infection, reporting, and death. Our simple phenomenological model uses the same data as a more complicated, process-based model, and therefore both approaches ultimately rely on the same information. The simpler approach, however, does not depend on assumptions about the infection processes. Nonetheless, after fitting the simpler model additional assumptions can be made to interpret the fits. An advantage of the simple statistical model is that the assumptions about processes do not affect the results (fits), and how the assumptions affect the interpretation of the results is more transparent than if the assumptions are made in the statistically fit model.",

Third, we wanted the R0 estimate to reflect conditions within a State and therefore exclude deaths or cases caused by infections contracted elsewhere and brought into the State. To balance these factors, we selected a threshold of 3 deaths per day, or 30 cases per day, as the starting point of the time series we analyzed.

If the disease had been spreading exponentially at constant rate for many days, and if the number of infected people was large, then the increase from x*(t-1) to x*(t) would approach a constant value; in other words, r(t) would give the exponential rate of spread of the disease. This would be true even if only a small fraction of the infected population died or was diagnosed, provided these fractions did not change through time. However, changes in the infection rate will mean that the disease is not at its \"stable infection age distribution\", the distribution of time since infection observed in the infected population (19) . While this does not affect the statistical model fitting, it will mean that the observed spread of the disease is not exactly equal to the rate of new infections. Nonetheless, because the distribution of times between infection and counting (deaths or cases) is fairly broad, the assumption that populations are at their \"stable infection age distribution\" is unlikely to cause a great difference between the observed rate of disease spread and the infection rate.

The differences between the fitted and observed death counts, x(t) and x*(t), are determined by measurement error. The time-varying estimates of r(t) decrease to near zero (Fig.   S1B ). The dashed lines in Fig. S1B give the standard deviations for the point estimates of r(t) produced by the Kalman filter. There is considerable day-to-day variation in the estimates of r(t), as anticipated by the observed changes in the death count. The bootstrap smooths out these fluctuations (Fig. S1C) . Furthermore, when the fitted line strays from the bootstrap confidence intervals, the data changes in a manner that cannot be captured by the bootstrap procedure. In other words, the variance in r(t) estimated from the data exceeds that from which the bootstrap was constructed. Because the bootstrap assumes that the variance in r(t) is homogeneous over the time series, places where r(t) strays from the bootstrap suggest more-rapid changes in the estimates of r(t) than elsewhere in the time series. Thus, the bootstrap gives a way to assess lack-of-fit of the data to the assumptions of the model.",

Estimating the rate of disease spread The rate of spread of a disease in a population, r, at the early phase of an epidemic (when the entire population is susceptible) depends on the basic reproduction number, R0, giving the number of secondary infections produced per infected individual, and the serial interval, T0, giving the average time between primary and secondary infections. Thus, if the spread rate and serial interval can be estimated, R0 can then be calculated. Case tracking in China give an estimate of T0 = 7.5 days (1). Therefore, we focus on estimating the rate of spread, r. The rate of spread of a disease can be estimated directly from the observed number of new deaths, or newly identified cases, in a population. The advantages of this approach to calculating r, and from this R0, instead of case-tracking include: (i) it captures all of the real-life complexities that affect R0 by simply observing what happened in real life, and (ii) it uses data",

We used a value of T0 = 7.5 days from Li et al.(1); smaller or larger values of T0 will naturally decrease or increase R0(t) but will not change the pattern in R0(t) through time. We also report values of R0(t) at dates that are offset by the average length of time between initial infection and death, or, for case data, the time between initial infection and reporting. These are taken as 18 days(20)and 8 days (the serial interval 1), respectively. Thus, our statistical model uses only the raw data on the observed changes in deaths or cases to calculate r(t), rather than making assumptions about the timing of transmission, death, and reporting.

Reversing the time series investigates this, because the variances of r0 and x0 in the reversed time series will have variances that have been accumulated over the future values that were reversed. Second, the model (S1a-c) updates changes in r(t) from changes in x(t), and if there are rapid changes in the true value of r(t), changes in the estimates of r(t) will occur with a lag. This lag can be captured by reversing the time series.Fitting the reversed time series shows little effect of initial assumptions about the variances in r0 and x0, because the estimates of r0 are the same in the forward and reversed analyses(Fig. S2).
