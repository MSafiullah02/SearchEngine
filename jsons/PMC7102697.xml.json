TMPRSS2 is detected on the epithelium of the small intestine and respiratory tract, that is the major cell targets of SARS-CoV, but not on the endothelium, which is refractory to SARS-CoV infection [13, 14]. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 physically interact [10\u2022]. Only a few S proteins get cleaved by TMPRSS2 to allow a pH- and cathepsin-independent efficient entry of SARS-CoV [10\u2022, 12\u2022]. TMPRSS2 cleaves S protein at sites distinct from those ascribed to trypsin and cathepsin L [12\u2022]. Upon contact of ACE2 with S protein, ACE2 is also cleaved by TMPRSS2 [10\u2022]. When expressed on opposing membranes, SARS-CoV S and the ACE2 + TMPRSS2 complex induce intercellular fusion [11\u2022]. However, newly expressed S proteins escape cleavage by TMPRSS2 allowing the production of virions decorated with uncleaved S [10\u2022, 11\u2022, 12\u2022], possibly because the tripartite association is prevented intracellularly.",

This activates TMPRSS2 to cleave a few S proteins into fusion-competent S1-S2 homodimers [10\u2022, 11\u2022, 12\u2022, 16], which immediately undergo typical class I fusion protein structural changes [17] which permit the viral envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane. S1-S2 heterodimers are probably too unstable to be incorporated into infectious virus particles [16, 18]. Moreover, activated TMPRSS2, and possibly ADAM17/TACE (TNF\u03b1 converting enzyme) [4\u2022\u2022, 19], concomitantly cleave ACE2. This results in the massive shedding of ACE2 ectodomains [10\u2022], probably due to amplification of the constitutive pathway [5].",

Indeed, soluble S both induces ACE2 shedding and worsens the clinical signs of SARS [21]. In humans and according to virus strain diversity, S/ACE2 affinity correlates with the efficacy of virus entry, the level of ACE2 cleavage and the intensity of the pathology. Furthermore, the highest affinity is associated with inter-human transmission [20, 22\u2022\u2022] (Figure 1b). Antibodies targeting the S binding site on ACE2 strongly inhibit viral infection [23]. The correlation between S/ACE2 affinity and SARS-CoV pathogenicity extends to the host range for other mammal species (except bats) in determining whether a particular ACE2 protein can act as a receptor for SARS-CoV or not (including among bats) (Figure 2b) [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Consequently, the accuracy of an animal model of human infection critically depends on the capacity to mimic the affinity between the human ACE2 and viral S protein. In mammals, except bats, SARS-CoV induces a \u2018toxic-like\u2019 syndrome by triggering a devastating massive cleavage of the cellular receptor used for entry, the molecular basis of which remains to be documented. Why bats do not exhibit clinical signs of infection by SARS-CoV remains puzzling.",

The fusion protein F is synthesized as a precursor maturated into a functional F1\u2013F2 heterodimer by cathepsin L via a clathrin-mediated recycling endosomal pathway [28, 29]. The attachment protein G is a tetramer consisting of two disulfide bridged dimers. Like the morbillivirus H and parainfluenzae HN proteins, its C-terminal globular head is folded into a six \u03b2-sheet blade propeller surmounting a stalk, transmembrane region and cytosolic tail. The sugar-free \u03b21\u2013\u03b26 dimer interface is conserved. The two heads rotate relative to each other by 0\u00b0, 63\u00b0 and 30\u201340\u00b0 for henipavirus G, measles virus H and HN, respectively, while the buried area is 9\u201310 nm2 for G and H against 18 nm2 for HN [30]. The sugars of G are poor in the DC-SIGN ligand oligomannose but rich in the sugar moiety recognized by LESCtin, a lectin specifically expressed on the sinusoidal endothelial cells of lymph node and liver [31].",

Bronchial epithelium gets infected in the pig and cat [42, 43, 44] but not in human [45] suggesting ectopic expression of ephrinB2/3 in the former species. A LW/YM substitution prevents ephrinB1 from acting as a receptor for NiV and HeV and binding to EphB4 and EphB2 receptor [35, 46, 47]. Correlatively, (i) all ligands compete with each other, (ii) the ephrinB2/3 binding site on NiV-G is exquisitely neutralized by specific antibodies in vitro and in vivo [48, 49\u2022] and (iii) there is a cross-protection between NiV and HeV [50].

            "text": "Interestingly, whereas NiV G and F induce fusion of cells expressing ephrinB2/B3, NiV preferentially enters after internalization via macropinocytosis [52\u2022\u2022], though acidic pH is not required [52\u2022\u2022, 53]. Virus entry, but not membrane fusion, is inoperative when the cytosolic tail of ephrinB2 has its PDZ-binding motif deleted or Tyr304 mutated [52\u2022\u2022]. These two motifs recruit Grb4 and the P21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1)/CdC42/Rac1 complex that govern macropinocytosis [33\u2022, 54, 55, 56\u2022, 57, 58, 59]. The need for macropinocytosis while the fusion machinery is operative at the cell surface is puzzling. Macropinocytosis occurs very rapidly upon contact [60] and could be faster than the fusion step but then macropinocytosis inhibitors would not be expected to prevent virus entry. Several hypotheses can be proposed: (i) fusion requires a specific Ca++ [61] and/or Na+ ionic environment as documented for Semliki Forest virus [62]. (ii) NiV replication requires a specific conditioning of the cytoplasm induced by contacting ephrinB2/B3. (iii) The nucleocapsid needs to reach a particular cytoplasmic location deeper in the cells, more favorable for viral polymerase activity. The latter would not be unprecedented since forced rerouting of virus normally entering by fusion at the cell surface into the endocytic pathway results in hampered infectivity as shown for pseudotyped measles virus and lentivectors [63, 64, 65].",

Their non-segmented negative RNA genomes code for the envelope glycoprotein GP which ensures both attachment to a (still elusive) cellular receptor and membrane fusion. GP is cleaved by a furin-like protease into mature GP1\u2013GP2 heterodimers [67]. Curiously, mutation of the furin-cleavage site does not abolish GP-mediated virus entry due to alternative cleavage [68]. GP is heavily glycosylated with sugar moieties recognized by LESCtin and DC-SIGN/R lectins that can enhance but not mediate infection [69, 70, 71, 72]. This high glycan content shields MHC class I and \u03b2-integrin from antibody recognition [73, 74], a finding that explains the previously reported apparent downregulation of the latter [75].",

            "text": "A cellular receptor of glycoprotein nature is predicted on the basis of saturable binding of soluble GP [76] and loss of binding after protease, periodate or tunicamycin treatment [76, 77]. In infected animals, the virus disseminates in many tissues [66]. The EboV receptor is stocked in trans-Golgi network membranes in all cell types including the non-permissive T and B lymphocytes. It is exported to the cell surface upon cell adhesion and internalized via a microtubule-dependent and actin-dependent pathway, respectively [78\u2022, 79\u2022]. EboV and MarV GP cross-compete for binding suggesting the use of a common receptor [76, 80]. However, 3 out of 4 key lysines (at positions 114,115 and 140) defining the receptor binding region (RBR) of EboV GP1 [76] are not conserved in MarV GP1 [81\u2022\u2022]. The structure of a soluble trimeric form of GP1\u2013GP2 reveals a GP1-based chalice form, lined by the RBR. The fusion competent GP2 trimers cradle the chalice stem, with the internal fusion peptide flanked by two \u03b2-sheets. The RBR is mostly shielded by a glycan cap and a mucin-like domain [82\u2022\u2022], the cleavage of which by cathepsins strongly enhances GP1\u2013GP2 binding to the cell surface [76, 83]. However, lowering the pH neither allows EboV entry at the cell surface, nor cell\u2013cell fusion by mucin-deleted GP1\u2013GP2, and the GP/receptor interaction is stable at acidic pH [76, 77, 84\u2022\u2022].",

Constitutive macropinocytosis in dendritic cells and macrophages fits with their permissiveness to EboV infection [90, 91]. Activation of Ax1 enhances both macropinocytosis and EboV entry [92] although the latter may be mediated by serum Gas6, which was recently reported to mediate non-specific entry for several enveloped viruses [93].",

Virus binds to the cell surface via recognition of sugar moieties (blue branches) of GP1 by DC-SIGN or LECStin (light green) (1) to be immediately internalized by macropinocytosis (2) and migrate through the endocytic pathway (3) until the mucin-like domain (mucin) is cleaved off from GP1 by resident cathepsin B (cath B). This results in RBR (yellow star) being accessible for binding to the postulated receptor (dark green question mark) (4). An additional activation event (disulfide bridge reduction?) occurs (5). This triggers the conformational changes of GP2 (yellow) that mediates fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and ensures the delivery of the nucleocapsid (NC) into the cytosol (pale yellow background) where replication occurs (6). Because the postulated receptor (question mark) is predicted to be expressed at the cell surface, it has been included in every step of virus internalization. Although not yet documented, endosome structures 4 to 6 may successively represent early, maturing, late and possibly endolysosomes, because of the \u223c1 h delay between the cell attachment and membrane fusion steps.",
