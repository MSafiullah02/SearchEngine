            "text": "During the last two decades, researchers have developed robust systems for recombinant subunit vaccine production in plants. Stably and transiently transformed plants have particular advantages that enable immunization of humans and animals via mucosal delivery. The initial goal to immunize orally by ingestion of plant-derived antigens has proven difficult to attain, although many studies have demonstrated antibody production in both humans and animals, and in a few cases, protection against pathogen challenge. Substantial hurdles for this strategy are low-antigen content in crudely processed plant material and limited antigen stability in the gut. An alternative is intranasal delivery of purified plant-derived antigens expressed with robust viral vectors, especially virus-like particles. The use of pattern recognition receptor agonists as adjuvants for mucosal delivery of plant-derived antigens can substantially enhance serum and mucosal antibody responses. In this chapter, we briefly review the methods for recombinant protein expression in plants, and describe progress with human and animal vaccines that use mucosal delivery routes. We do not attempt to compile a comprehensive list, but focus on studies that progressed to clinical trials or those that showed strong indications of efficacy in animals. Finally, we discuss some regulatory concerns regarding plant-based vaccines.",

            "text": "Advances in plant biotechnology in the last two decades have facilitated production of recombinant proteins in plants, including subunit vaccine antigens. Several good review articles (Rybicki 2009; Streatfield 2006; Thanavala et al. 2006; Yusibov and Rabindran 2008) have summarized much of this work and have focused attention on the utility of plants for subunit vaccine expression. During the twenty years since the seminal work that demonstrated the potential of plantderived vaccines (Curtiss and Cardineau 1990; Mason et al. 1992) , a large body of literature has demonstrated expression of antigens in many plants, including edible plants like corn, potato, and tomato, as well as tobacco and its relatives. And yet, commercial development of plant-derived vaccine products has been very slow, for a variety of reasons, as discussed previously (Rybicki 2009 ). One of the biggest obstacles is the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in a new technology when the existing seems adequate. However, a steady accumulation of promising data has shown that plant-based expression has great potential, especially if a few hurdles can be overcome.",

Moreover, the inherent plant-to-plant variability in antigen content requires processing of plant material to produce a well-characterized batch of antigen that can be administered in controlled dosages. Thus, plant-derived oral vaccine immunogens will require substantial purification and concentration, and probable delivery in capsules that protect them from proteolytic degradation in the small intestine.",

The plant host is usually the tobacco relative Nicotiana benthamiana (Goodin et al. 2008) , which is remarkably permissive to many plant viruses. Expression levels obtained with viral vectors in N. benthamiana leaves are variable depending on the protein, but are generally ten-fold greater than in stable transformants of the nuclear genome, and frequently in the range of 1-2 mg/kg of leaf mass. Thus, the prospect of plant-based expression and purification of vaccine antigens, especially virus-like particles (VLP) (Huang et al. 2009 ), for mucosal delivery is substantially brighter than that obtained using stably integrated transgenes. Moreover, the high yields of recombinant antigens that can be obtained using viral vectors may facilitate intranasal delivery, which requires smaller volumes and hence, more concentrated vaccine solutions than the oral delivery route.",

            "text": "An ideal mucosal vaccine would induce both antibody-and cell-mediated protection, not only at the relevant mucosal site, but also throughout the body. The most convenient means to achieve mucosal immunity in global health programs is oral delivery. Oral vaccination eliminates the possibility of transmission of other infectious diseases by contaminated needles, as well as elimination of pain associated with injections and the need for trained personnel to deliver the vaccines (Holmgren and Czerkinsky 2005; Lavelle 2005 ). However, nasal vaccines are not hampered by the physical and chemical barriers of the gut. Nasal vaccination has demonstrated particular potential with regard to induction of broadly disseminated immunity (Neutra and Kozlowski 2006; Staats et al. 1997) . In humans, monkeys, and mice, nasal immunization induced antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in salivary glands, upper and lower respiratory tracts, small and large intestines, and most notably male and female reproductive tracts (Harandi et al. 2003; Imaoka et al. 1998; Kozlowski et al. 2002; Rudin et al. 1999; Staats et al. 1997 ). In addition, the nasal route of immunization can induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in distant mucosal tissues including the female reproductive tract (Gallichan and Rosenthal 1998) . In both humans and mice, nasal immunization has produced greater systemic antibody responses than other mucosal immunization routes (Kozlowski et al. 1997 (Kozlowski et al. , 2002 Staats et al. 1997) . Kunkel and Butcher (2002) provided evidence from na\u00efve human vaccine recipients that mucosal immunization can prime the immune system for both mucosal and systemic responses by inducing the expression of both mucosal and systemic homing receptors in responding lymphocytes. Thus, delivery of subunit antigens or VLP via the nasal route has excellent prospects as a vaccine strategy. For further reading on VLP vaccines, readers are directed to ''Recent Advances in Microparticle and Nanoparticle Delivery Vehicles for Mucosal Vaccination'' of this volume.",

They include stably integrated transgenes in the nuclear or chloroplast genomes, and transient expression using vectors that are either non-replicating or that utilize plant virus replication elements to amplify the mRNA for the target gene. Nuclear genes behave in a Mendelian fashion, and utilize the typical eukaryotic pathways of protein translation, processing, and subcellular localization. Organ-and development stage-specific promoters can be utilized, such that foreign proteins can be directed to accumulate in seeds (Nochi et al. 2007; Streatfield et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2007 ). Expression of antigens in seeds has a particular advantage in regard to protein stability due to drying of the storage tissue during seed development. Thus, seeds can be stored at ambient temperatures for months to years with little loss of protein activity.",

In most cases, the recombinant construct is delivered as DNA using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a plant pathogen that has the ability to transfer genes into the plant cell nucleus (Gelvin 2003) . The foreign DNA may be integrated stably into the host nuclear chromosomal DNA by non-homologous recombination at random sites, although some work suggests that transcriptionally active sites may be preferentially targeted. The transferred DNA may also reside in the nucleus without integration for several days, and can thus act as a template for transcription to effect transient expression. Unless the foreign DNA is constructed as a viral replicon, it will remain in low-copy numbers, but can be used to evaluate expression of foreign antigens (Huang and Mason 2004) .",

Recombinant viral genomes can also be delivered directly as RNA after in vitro transcription from a plasmid by simply abrading the leaf surface and applying a solution of RNA (Gleba et al. 2007; Yusibov et al. 2006) . In this case, the replicon needs to contain viral elements that mediate longdistance transport in the plant vasculature so that expression is not restricted only to the site of inoculation.",

The DNA construct is delivered by micro projectile bombardment (gene gun), and site-specific recombination allows targeted gene insertion. One great advantage of chloroplast transgenes is that they are not usually subject to gene silencing mediated by RNA interference, which is a common problem with nuclear transgenes. Another advantage is that the chloroplast genome is exclusively maternally inherited, making gene containment much easier because pollen grains are devoid of plastids.

The variable rNV content of the tubers (215-750 lg per dose) and relatively poor VLP assembly in the potato (effective rNV dose of B325 lg per dose) were likely limiting factors. However, a detrimental effect of the potato vehicle, perhaps due to poor release of VLP in the gut lumen, cannot be discounted. A clinical trial using orally delivered purified insect cell-derived rNV (i-rNV) produced stronger antibody responses at 250 lg per dose than were obtained with potato (Tacket et al. 2003) , suggesting that purified rNV is a more potent oral immunogen.",

It was also shown that air-dried tomato fruit was at least as active in mice as freezedried tomato, indicating that sophisticated drying technology is not required for rNV in tomato.

We undertook these experiments to evaluate the potential of these VLP to induce distal mucosal IgA responses with or without adjuvant. In unpublished studies we examined the TLR9 agonist, CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) as adjuvant because it is known to trigger an immunostimulatory cascade that culminates in the maturation, differentiation, and proliferation of multiple cell types, including B cells, and CpG-ODN had been used previously in mice by the nasal route (Abe et al. 2006; Balmelli et al. 1998; McCluskie et al. 2000) . We nasally immunized conscious female BALB/c mice with 25 lg purified t-rNV alone or t-rNV with 10 lg type B CpG-ODN. Nasal immunization of conscious mice with VLP has been shown to target antigen to the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) but not deeper respiratory tract tissues (BALT); whereas nasal immunization of sedated mice is more analogous to intratracheal administration (Balmelli et al. 1998) . We also immunized mice orally with 100 lg t-rNV alone. The rNV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies induced in serum were analyzed to determine if immunization had produced a Th1, Th2, or mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. Overall, rNV-specific serum IgG levels were higher in nasally versus orally immunized mice, with greatest levels achieved by nasal co-delivery of CpG-ODN with rNV ( Fig. 1a-c) . Within the nasal groups, both anti-rNV IgG1 and IgG2a in serum were significantly increased in the CpG-ODN immunization group relative to controls. This suggests that CpG-ODN drives a mixed Th1/Th2 response with respect to the production of anti-rNV antibodies.",

Fecal IgA was produced only in the CpG-ODN immunization groups (Fig. 1d ). In addition, the levels of rNV-specific IgA and IgG in vaginal lavages were significantly elevated (p\\ 0.001) in nasal groups given rNV with CpG-ODN ( Fig. 1e and f) . To further characterize distal induction of antigen-specific IgA, we Significantly higher levels of rNV-specific antibody production were observed throughout the time course in mice immunized IN with t-rNV and CpG ODN compared to t-rNV alone or vehicle alone-immunized mice. Prism software from GraphPad was used to conduct one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test (p\\ 0.05 was considered significant) evaluated IgA production at additional mucosal sites, including salivary samples, gastrointestinal lavages, nasal washes, and bronchoalveolar lavages. At each of these distal mucosal sites, IgA production was significantly increased relative to controls in the rNV/CpG-ODN-immunized mice (Fig. 2a-d) . These results demonstrate that t-rNV co-delivered with TLR agonist by the nasal route can induce robust antigen-specific IgA production at distal mucosal sites that would be important for mucosal protection against not only enteric organisms, but also respiratory and sexually-transmitted pathogens. Overall, the data demonstrate that immunization with t-rNV by the nasal route is more effective than the oral route for inducing robust rNV-specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibody responses in upper and lower respiratory (nasal and bronchoalveolar), gastrointestinal (salivary, intestine and fecal), and female reproductive (vaginal) tracts. We are now planning a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate systemic and mucosal antibody responses to t-rNV after nasal delivery with a selected adjuvant.

HBV is transmitted mainly by blood or through sexual contact, but vertical transmission occurs frequently when HBV-infected mothers give birth. In this regard, a mucosal HBV vaccine may be an improvement over the current intramuscular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccine made in recombinant yeast (McAleer et al. 1984) . Moreover, an orally delivered plantderived vaccine could improve patient compliance for multiple doses due to the convenience, and it would obviate the need for needles. However, we must take care to avoid interference with current efforts to expand HBV vaccination in the developing world, and move forward with a plant-derived vaccine only if distinct advantages are demonstrated.",

            "text": "The perception among plant vaccinologists that a plant-derived HBV vaccine is important is apparent from the large body of work demonstrating expression of HBsAg in a variety of plants including potato, lettuce, tomato, tomatillo, corn, and banana (Streatfield 2005 ). The first publication on plant-based vaccine antigen expression was with HBsAg in transgenic tobacco (Mason et al. 1992) . After optimization of HBsAg expression in transgenic potato tubers (Richter et al. 2000) , its oral immunogenicity in mice (albeit dependent upon inclusion of CT; Kong et al. 2001) , encouraged a human trial. Due to FDA concerns that immunologically na\u00efve subjects might experience antigenic tolerance after ingestion of HBsAg, the clinical study used HBsAg seropositive volunteers who had been previously vaccinated with the yeast recombinant HBsAg (Thanavala et al. 2005) . Titers of anti-HBsAg in serum were increased in 9/17 and 10/16 volunteers who consumed 2 or 3 doses of transgenic potatoes, respectively, with each dose containing roughly 850 lg HBsAg. This finding suggests that oral boosting with plant-derived HBsAg could be incorporated as a viable component of immunization programs. Oral delivery of HBsAg can activate systemic memory cells generated by intramuscular immunization, However, the possibility of priming immunization by HBsAg potato ingestion cannot be excluded. An earlier study had shown that presumably na\u00efve human subjects who ingested transgenic lettuce expressing low levels of HBsAg underwent seroconversion (Kapusta et al. 1999) . It is interesting to note that neither of these clinical trials employed an adjuvant, which suggests that oral delivery can be substantially optimized in further work.",

Three of the antigen-treated volunteers, but none of the individuals in the control group, showed significant boosting of anti-rabies virus antibody in serum. Based on these results, na\u00efve subjects were tested. Nine volunteers consumed 3 doses of raw rabies-recombinant spinach leaves (150 g per dose) and 5 were fed control spinach. All subjects then received a single dose of commercial rabies vaccine 7 days after the last oral dose.

Moreover, evidence indicates that vaccinated individuals generate less robust and long-lasting antibody titers than individuals who recovered from a natural MV infection (Muller et al. 2003) . Thus, boosting with a convenient mucosally delivered MV vaccine would be a great boon to health, especially in resource-poor countries. Two groups of researchers have approached this problem using plant-derived vaccines. Webster and colleagues expressed a soluble form of the MV hemagglutinin (MV-H) surface protein in stable transgenic tobacco and lettuce (Webster et al. 2006 (Webster et al. , 2005 . The MV-H was stable in freeze-dried lettuce leaf stored at room temperature for 6 months, and showed only 30-40% loss after 13 months (Webster et al. 2006) . Moreover, the dried MV-H was orally immunogenic in mice after resuspension and delivery by gavage with a crude saponin adjuvant. Since no reference standard was available, the amount of MV-H antigen in the lettuce could not be accurately determined. Best results were obtained when mice were systemically primed with a MV-H DNA vaccine, then orally boosted five times with lettuce expressing MV-H. The mean titers of MV-specific serum IgG were boosted tenfold by the oral doses, while control lettuce had no effect. The virus-neutralizing titers were roughly 3.5-fold higher in MV-H lettuce boosted mice than in control lettuce mice. These data indicate the potential for oral boosting with plant-derived MV-H for humans that have been intramuscularly vaccinated but experience waning of anti-MV antibody titer.",

The non-toxic LTB protein mediates binding of the LT holotoxin to epithelial cells, triggering intracellular delivery of the toxic A subunit. The rationale for a mucosal vaccine rationale presumes that oral delivery of LTB will induce local secretion of anti-LTB antibodies in the gut, which will prevent the binding of the holotoxin to enterocytes. Data from mouse studies supports this hypothesis, and mice that ingested LTBcontaining potato tubers were partially protected against LT challenge, as indicated by reduced fluid secretion in the small intestine ). The clinical trial showed that ingestion of LTB in potatoes stimulated anti-LT serum IgG in 9 of 11 subjects, serum IgA in six subjects, and fecal IgA in 5 of 10 subjects; and further showed that the antibodies could neutralize LT (Tacket et al. 1998 ). Another clinical trial using transgenic maize germ (embryo of seeds) expressing LTB yielded similar results (Tacket et al. 2004) . The fact that LTB is one of the most orally immunogenic proteins known does not diminish the impact of these findings, which provide clear evidence that the ingestion of crude plant material, in the absence of adjuvant, could potentially stimulate protective antibody responses to enteric pathogens in humans.",

The disease is highly infectious, and the severe diarrhea and vomiting produce high mortality in young piglets. The envelope spike (S) protein is a target for neutralizing antibody, and thus has been expressed in plant systems for oral delivery (Howard 2004; Lamphear et al. 2004) . Transgenic corn seed expressing TGEV-S protein fed to piglets stimulated antibody production and partially protected animals from viral challenge (Howard 2004) . The truncated soluble S protein product was targeted to the cell wall instead of protein bodies, which allowed accumulation of antigen at 13 mg/kg seed, and a dose of 20-30 mg S protein in a single feeding. Further studies examined the potential to immunize gilts (young sows) and stimulate anti-S antibody secretion in the milk for protection of suckling piglets (Lamphear et al. 2004) . Oral dosing by ingestion of TGEV-S corn by gilts on days -35 and -14 before farrowing (day 0), after having received the modified live TGEV vaccine orally at days -115 and -102, stimulated significantly higher TGEV-neutralizing activity in serum, colostrum (day 0), and milk (day 3) compared to a placebo group. Antibody isotypes were not determined, but the authors suggest that the milk antibodies later than day two are mostly IgA (Lamphear et al. 2004) . Protective efficacy was not examined, but the neutralizing titers in milk suggest that suckling piglets would have been protected. However, the milk titers dropped precipitously at day 7-14, suggesting that continued boosting would be necessary to maintain protection.",

Although the pathogenic mechanism is not fully understood, Apx toxins are associated with bacterial virulence (Shin et al. 2005) . The Apx I, II, and III toxins mediate virulence by inserting into host cell membranes and creating pores; thus they may be good targets for immune intervention in this disease. One group has demonstrated the protective potential of ApxIA and ApxIIA proteins as vaccine antigens after oral delivery in mice (Lee et al. 2006; Shin et al. 2005 Shin et al. , 2007 . Their first study used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for expression of ApxIIA and oral delivery in mice, showing ApxIIAspecific IgA production in lung and intestine, as well as partial (B50%) and dosedependent protection against challenge with A. pleuropneumoniae.",

Mice were gavaged with 4 weekly doses of dried tobacco leaf (1 mg or 5 mg dry mass, which we estimate contained 30 or 150 ng ApxIIA) suspended in PBS, which evoked modest serum IgG specific for ApxIIA in the higher dose group. Challenge of the mice by intraperitoneal injection of A. pleuropneumoniae killed all mice in the control nontransgenic tobacco group within 72 h, while 50% of the higher-dose ApxIIA tobacco group survived. By comparison, 90% of mice immunized subcutaneously with recombinant E. coli-expressed ApxIIA survived (Lee et al. 2006) . Although the ultimate fate of the mice beyond 72 h was not reported, it appears that oral delivery of ApxIIA tobacco afforded some protection. A later oral immunization study using both ApxIA and ApxIIA expressed in yeast showed enhanced protective efficacy over either toxin delivered alone, suggesting that multiple toxins should be included in a swine vaccine (Shin et al. 2007 ). Certainly, the levels of antigen expression in plants must be increased in order to facilitate more robust protection by oral delivery. Moreover, testing in swine must be performed in order to examine the potential for protection by oral delivery of the Apx antigens.",

The seed vehicle provides a stable environment for accumulated proteins, thus the need for refrigeration could be obviated or minimized. Nonetheless, only a few antigens have been expressed in seeds at sufficient levels to afford protection in animals upon ingestion. Due to the variable nature of protein structure and biochemical characteristics, it is difficult to predict which proteins will accumulate well and be correctly folded to display protective epitopes. The generation and screening for optimal expression in stable transgenic plant lines is a time-and labor-intensive process, but in some cases may yield excellent results.",

These systems provide expression levels high enough to facilitate purification of antigens in good yield and concentrated enough to use for intranasal delivery, or to incorporate into oral delivery formulations. Ongoing work to develop mucosal adjuvants will synergize with these efficient plant expression systems to provide more alternatives for vaccination and, ultimately, vaccines tailored for particular pathogens and their hosts. Agonists for pattern recognition receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptors) show great promise as mucosal adjuvants, and deserve further research and development.",
