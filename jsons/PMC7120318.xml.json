            "text": "The name Staphylococcus (staphyle, bunch of grapes) was introduced by Ogston (1883) for the group micrococci causing inflammation and suppuration. He was the first to differentiate two kinds of pyogenic cocci: one arranged in groups or masses was called \u201cStaphylococcus\u201d and another arranged in chains was named \u201cBillroth\u2019s Streptococcus.\u201d A formal description of the genus Staphylococcus was provided by Rosenbach (1884). He divided the genus into the two species Staphylococcus aureus and S. albus. Zopf (1885) placed the mass-forming staphylococci and tetrad-forming micrococci in the genus Micrococcus. In 1886, the genus Staphylococcus was separated from Micrococcus by Fl\u00fcgge (1886). He differentiated the two genera mainly on the basis of their action on gelatin and on relation to their hosts. Staphylococci liquefied gelatin and were parasitic or pathogenic or both whereas micrococci were variable in their action on gelatin and were saprophytic. The genera Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Planococcus, containing Gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, were later placed in the family Micrococcaceae. Evans et al. (1955) proposed separating staphylococci from micrococci on the basis of their relation to oxygen. The facultative anaerobic cocci were placed in the genus Staphylococcus and the obligate aerobic cocci in the genus Micrococcus. By the mid-1960s, a clear distinction could be made between staphylococci and micrococci on the basis of their DNA base composition (Silvestri and Hill, 1965). Members of the genus Staphylococcus have a DNA G+C content of 33\u201340 mol%, whereas members of the genus Micrococcus have a high G+C content of around 70 mol%. Further studies have shown that staphylococci can be distinguished from micrococci and other catalase-positive cocci on the basis of their cell wall composition (Schleifer and Kandler, 1972; Endl et al., 1983), cytochrome profile (Faller et al., 1980) and menaquinone pattern (Collins and Jones, 1981), susceptibility to lysostaphin and erythromycin (Schleifer and Kloos, 1975b), bacitracin (Falk and Guering, 1983), and furazolidone (Baker, 1984). Comparative immunochemical studies of catalases (Schleifer, 1986), DNA-DNA hybridization studies, DNA-rRNA hybridization studies (Schleifer et al., 1979; Kilpper et al., 1980), and comparative oligonucleotide cataloguing of 16S rRNA (Ludwig et al., 1981) clearly demonstrated the epigenetic and genetic difference of staphylococci and micrococci. Members of the genus Staphylococcus form a coherent and well-defined group of related species that is widely divergent from those of the genus Micrococcus. Until the early 1970s, the genus Staphylococcus consisted of three species: the coagulase-positive species S. aureus and the coagulase-negative species S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus, but a deeper look into the chemotaxonomic and genotypic properties of staphylococci led to the description of many new staphylococcal species. Currently, 36 species and several subspecies are recognized in the genus Staphylococcus (Table 1).",

Colonies should be allowed to grow for at least an additional two to three days before the primary isolation plate is confirmed for species or strain composition (Kloos and Schleifer, 1975b; Kloos and Schleifer, 1975c). This growth period is particularly important when the sampling of more than one colony is needed to obtain sufficient inocula for determining the predominant organism or to obtain a pure culture. Failure to hold plates for 72 h, can result in 1) selection of more than one species or strain if sampling yields an inoculum of two or more colonies, 2) selection of an organism(s) not producing the infection, if the specimen contains two or more different species or strains, and 3) incorrectly labeling a mixed culture as a pure culture. Colonies should be Gram-stained, subcultured, and tested for genus, species, and strain properties. It should be noted that most staphylococci of major medical interest produce growth in the upper as well as the lower anaerobic portions of thioglycolate broth or semisolid agar (Kloos and Schleifer, 1975c).",

At least 1 ml of midstream urine should be collected in a sterile, wide-mouth container. Unpreserved specimens should be cultured within 2 h of collection or stored in a refrigerator for no more than 24 h. Most references to diagnostic criteria state that a significant bacteriuria occurs when there are 100,000 cells or more per ml in a clean-voided, midstream specimen obtained from asymptomatic patients. With acute dysuria and frequency in young, sexually active females, a colony count as low as 100 per ml may be a useful criterion. Many significant urinary tract infections due to S. saprophyticus are associated with only 100 to 10,000 colonies per ml. If significant, these low counts may be substantiated by repetition of the procedure. Significant bacteriuria may also be determined by microscopic examination of a Gram-stained smear of uncentrifuged urine. The presence of at least two bacteria per 1000-X microscopic field of the Gram-stained smear is approximately equal to 100,000 or more cells per ml (Pollock, 1983).",

Interestingly, the activity of these regulators is controlled by PTS-mediated phosphorylation. A putative transcriptional terminator partially overlapping an inverted repeat, which could be the target site for the antiterminator protein GlcT, is found in the glcT-glcA intergenic region. This organization resembles the glcT-ptsG region of B. subtilis, encoding the GlcT antiterminator protein and the glucose-specific enzyme II, respectively (St\u00fclke and Hillen, 1999). Therefore, glcA expression in S. carnosus is most likely controlled by antitermination.

Glucose is transported through the cell membrane via GlcU in a nonphosphorylated form and is subsequently phosphorylated by GlkA. This PTS-independent system substantially contributes to glucose catabolism in S. xylosus. The novel, non-PTS glucose uptake gene glcU and the downstream gene gdh, which encodes glucose dehydrogenase, are found in a bicistronic operon (Fiegler et al., 1999). A similar organization has also been found in B. subtilis. The glucose kinase gene, glkA, is not part of the operon in S. xylosus (Wagner et al., 1995). The glcU and glkA genes were first detected by using Tn917 insertions that resulted in a defect in glucose-specific catabolite repression of the lactose operon. Several other catabolic operons are also affected, which suggests the involvement of GlcU and GlkA in catabolite repression. There is evidence that the GlcU permease is functional at high extracellular glucose concentrations; the highly efficient glucose-specific PTS recognizes and transports glucose preferentially at low external glucose concentrations. The mechanism by which GlcU allows glucose to enter the cells remains to be elucidated. In the genome sequence of S. aureus, homologs of glcU and glkA are present, which strongly suggests that also in this and perhaps other staphylococcal species, glucose is taken up by both PTS-dependent and PTS-independent mechanisms.",

Galactose and lactose (Bassias and Br\u00fcckner, 1998), the pentoses xylose, ribose and arabinose, the corresponding pentitols, and glycerol are clearly non-PTS sugars (Lehmer and Schleifer, 1980; Table 6). The lactose utilization enzymes of S. xylosus comprise LacP (lactose permease) and LacH (\u03b2-galactosidase). The lacR gene, found upstream of lacPH encodes the activator (Bassias and Br\u00fcckner, 1998). Lactose transport and \u03b2-galactosidase activity are induced by the addition of lactose to the growth medium. The lacPH promoter is also subject to carbon catabolite repression mediated by the catabolite control protein CcpA. Relevant PTS-independent transporter genes annotated in the genome of S. aureus N315 are shown in Table 7.",

In S. aureus, galactose is converted to D-galactose 6-P, which is further metabolized through tagatose derivatives (Fig. 3). A study of the distribution of the tagatose-6-P pathway in various staphylococcal species has revealed that the key enzyme of this pathway, tagatose-6-P kinase, is found in S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. hominis. These species do not possess enzymes of the Leloir pathway. The tagatose-6-P kinase is inducible by growth on galactose or lactose. In contrast, S. intermedius, S. saprophyticus and S. xylosus use galactose only via the Leloir pathway and not via the tagatose-6-P pathway (Schleifer et al., 1978). The cloned lactose operon (Fig. 4) of S. aureus contains not only the phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase gene and genes involved in lactose uptake, but also the genes of the tagatose-6-P pathway (Breidt et al., 1987; Oskouian and Stewart, 1987). The corresponding genes are arranged in a heptacistronic operon (lacABCDFEG). The locus was originally defined by mutations abolishing lactose utilization. The genes lacFE code for the galactoside-specific PTS permease, enzyme IIA, and enzyme IICB (Breidt and Stewart, 1986). The last gene, lacG, encodes the phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase. The lacABCD genes specify the enzymes of the tagatose-6-P pathway, with lacAB coding for galactose-6-P isomerase, lacC for tagatose-6-P kinase, and lacD for tagatose-1,6-diP aldolase (Rosey et al., 1991). The gene encoding the lactose operon repressor, lacR, is upstream of the lacABCDFEG operon (Oskouian and Stewart, 1990a; Oskouian et al., 1990b). Utilization of lactose and galactose in S. aureus relies on the PTS-dependent uptake and phosphorylation of the sugars, resulting in lactose 6-P and galactose 6-P, respectively. Glucose and galactose 6-P are produced from intracellular lactose 6-P by a phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase (Hengstenberg et al., 1993). Glucose is metabolized via the FBP pathway, whereas galactose 6-P is degraded via the tagatose-6-P pathway.",

The GlcA and GlcB proteins mentioned above would thus be good candidates for sucrose uptake factors.",

A xylose transporter is not part of the operon. The XylR protein acts as a repressor that binds to an operator site identified by footprint analysis (Sizemore et al., 1992). An interesting finding is that xylose is the inducer; gel-mobility shift experiments have shown that XylR is inactivated only in the presence of xylose, but not of xylose-P or other phosphorylated sugars. The xyl operon is also subject to glucose catabolite repression at the level of transcription; this control is independent of a functional xylR gene. Indeed, apart from the XylR operator sequence, a catabolite responsive element (cre) is also in front of xylA; cre is involved in glucose repression by binding activated CcpA (Hueck et al., 1994; Egeter and Br\u00fcckner, 1996).",

In S. aureus, glucose is metabolized principally via glycolysis and to a limited extent by the PP oxidative pathway (Sivakanesan and Dawes, 1980). However, certain staphylococcal species, such as S. epidermidis and S. intermedius, are distinguished by a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP)-activated, NAD-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; G\u00f6tz and Schleifer, 1975; G\u00f6tz and Schleifer, 1976). The enzyme has a total Mr of 130,000 and is composed of four subunits. Physiological studies with S. epidermidis have shown that the intracellular concentration of FBP influences the LDH activity. During anaerobic growth and in the presence of glucose, a high intracellular concentration of FBP is reached, resulting in maximal LDH activity. In cells grown anaerobically in a glucose-limited medium, the FBP pool is exhausted because of glucose limitation. In this case, LDH is not fully saturated with FBP and its activity is not maximal. Similar results have been obtained with cells grown aerobically in a glucose-excess medium (G\u00f6tz and Schleifer, 1978).",

There are two forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase which can be differentiated by their catalytic and structural properties. Class I aldolases function via the formation of a Schiff base intermediate between the substrate and a lysine amino group of the enzyme. Class II aldolases do not form a Schiff base intermediate, but contain an essential divalent cation, such as Zn+2, Ca+2 or Fe+2, and can be inhibited by EDTA. Since class I aldolases are typical for higher animals and plants and are only found in a few bacteria, it is surprising that nearly all staphylococcal species studied so far possess a class I aldolase (G\u00f6tz et al., 1980). The only exceptions are S. intermedius and S. hyicus, which possess both classes of aldolases, and S. caseolyticus (reclassified as Macrococcus caseolyticus), which possesses only a class II aldolase (Fischer et al., 1982). The 33-kDa class I aldolase of S. aureus strain ATCC 12600 has been purified; it appears to be active as a monomer (G\u00f6tz et al., 1980). Later, the S. carnosus TM300 fda gene, encoding the glycolytic fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (Fda), was cloned in E. coli. The 296-amino-acid protein has a Mr of 32,855. The S. carnosus FDA is also a class I aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), which does not need divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Cloning of fda back into S. carnosus led to a sixfold increase of aldolase production and activity. Glucose in the growth medium has a stimulating effect on aldolase production or activity (Witke and G\u00f6tz, 1993).",

Numerous publications on S. aureus describe the influence of glucose on a variety of cellular processes, such as utilization of alternative carbon sources, production of extracellular enzymes, activity of glycolytic enzymes, and cytochrome content. Especially the production of potential virulence factors has attracted considerable attention. However, the mechanism by which glucose exerts its regulatory effect has not been elucidated. The analysis of catabolite repression of inducible systems is quite often complicated by the inability of the inducer to enter the cells in appreciable amounts, when glucose is also present in the medium. In addition to this process, referred to as \u201cinducer exclusion/inducer expulsion,\u201d the rapid removal of internalized inducer, has been described for a number of Gram-positive bacteria (Saier et al., 1996).

This autoregulation of ccpA apparently reflects the need of S. xylosus to balance regulation by CcpA carefully. CcpA shows a relatively weak affinity for its cognate operator sites, termed \u201ccatabolite responsive elements\u201d (cre; Hueck et al., 1994), and must, therefore, be activated to bind efficiently to cre. The signal enabling CcpA to bind to DNA is a phosphorylated form of HPr, the phosphocarrier protein of the PTS, which is produced by the HPr kinase (HPrK; Huynh et al., 2000). HPr is phosphorylated at Ser-46 in an ATP-dependent manner and can also be dephosphorylated by the same enzyme. Thus, HPrK constitutes a bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphatase. HPr as well as HPr kinase are absolutely required for CcpA activity in S. xylosus (Jankovic and Br\u00fcckner, 2002). The genetic organization around the hprK gene of S. xylosus is identical to that in S. epidermidis and S. aureus (Huynh et al., 2000).",

Cytochrome b-557 is reduced in the presence of 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO), while all the other hemoproteins of the respiratory chain remain oxidized. In contrast to cytochromes a-602 and b-555, cytochrome b-557 is not reduced by ascorbate-dichlorophenol-indophenol, suggesting that it has a lower reduction potential than the other cytochromes. The most significant difference, however, is that cytochrome b-557, unlike cytochromes b-555 and a-602, does not react with carbon monoxide. Cytochrome b-557 appears to be an intermediate electron carrier of the cytochrome b or b1-type. Cytochrome b-555, which is also found in S. epidermidis, binds carbon monoxide and probably is the major terminal oxidase; it is therefore, now referred to as \u201ccytochrome O.\u201d There are some indications that the prosthetic groups of cytochromes O and b-557 are protohemins. The role of cytochrome a-602 as a terminal oxidase is less clear. It may be involved with nitrate reductase activity. In particulate enzyme preparations from S. aureus, succinate oxidase, NAD-linked ethanol oxidase, and NADH-oxidase activities are detectable. Succinate oxidase activity is inhibited by ultraviolet (UV) light (340 nm) and surprisingly by amytal (barbiturate A), which inhibits electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone in higher organisms. The two oxidation-reduction dyes, methylene blue and 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol interact with the electron transfer system. The reduced form of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol reduces cytochrome a-602 and cytochrome O without reducing cytochrome b-557. It was found that trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) inhibited the growth of S. aureus but not of S. epidermidis. This selective inhibition of S. aureus was based on the inhibition of the electron transport system by oxidizing the cytochromes in S. aureus. It was suggested that the inhibition occurred between cytochrome b and cytochrome O (Suzuki et al., 1992).",

In E. coli, the nar promoter is induced by the trans-acting factors ferredoxin-NADP reductase (Fnr) and phosphorylated NarL; Fnr is activated in response to oxygen deprivation and NarL is the response regulator of a two-component system that signals the presence of nitrate.

The NirBD proteins represent the dissimilatory NADH-dependent nitrite reductase, SirA and SirB (both necessary for biosynthesis of the siroheme prosthetic group), the putative oxidase/chelatase and the uroporphyrinogen III methylase, respectively, and NirR, a protein with known function. It was suggested that NirR is essential for nir promoter activity (Neubauer et al., 1999a). In the absence of NirR, a weak promoter upstream of sirA seems to drive transcription of sirA, nirB, nirD and sirB in the stationary growth phase. Nitrite reduction in S. carnosus does not occur in the presence of oxygen and nitrate (Neubauer and G\u00f6tz, 1996), which is in agreement with the fact that anaerobiosis, nitrite, and nitrate induce the nir promoter. Although a transcript is detectable, no nitrite reduction occurs in cells grown aerobically with nitrate or nitrite, indicating an additional oxygen-controlled step at the level of translation, enzyme folding, assembly, or insertion of prosthetic groups. The nitrite-reducing activity expressed during anaerobiosis is switched off reversibly when the oxygen tension increases, most likely owing to the competition for electrons with the aerobic respiratory chain. Another gene, nirC, is located upstream of the nir operon and encodes a putative integral membrane-spanning protein with unknown function. A nirC mutant showed no distinct phenotype. In S. carnosus, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite evidently by a dissimilatory enzyme. Nitrite accumulates in the growth medium and is further reduced by a dissimilatory NADH-dependent nitrite reductase. Nitrite reduction only occurs in the absence of nitrate.",

Mutants defective in modABC revealed only 0.4% of wildtype nitrate reductase activity. Molybdate at a nonphysiologically high concentration (100 \u00b5M) fully restored nitrate reductase activity, suggesting that at least one other system is able to transport molybdate but with lower affinity. The expression of modA (and most likely modBC) was independent from oxygen and nitrate. To date, there are no indications for molybdate-specific regulation of modABC expression since in a modB mutant, modA expression was unchanged and no different from that in the wildtype strain (Neubauer et al., 1999b).",

First hints for an involvement of glycyl-tRNA were based on the finding that incorporation of glycine into polymeric peptidoglycan was prevented by ribonuclease. Under identical conditions, the incorporation of N-acetylmuramyl-peptide from the nucleotide precursor was unaffected. Five glycine residues activated by tRNA are added initially to the \u025b-NH2 group of lysine and then subsequently to the N-terminus of the growing peptide chain (Kamiryo and Matsuhashi, 1972). This mechanism is in direct contrast to that of protein synthesis, which occurs by addition at the carboxyl terminus. The residues appeared to be added singly with no evidence for the involvement of peptidyl tRNA intermediates. The tRNA of S. aureus has been found to contain at least three species of glycyl-tRNA (Gly-tRNA). They can be used for the incorporation of glycine into peptidoglycan, whereas one of the species is inactive in protein synthesis. The formation of all Gly-tRNA is catalyzed by a single Gly-tRNA synthetase, which has been purified (Niyomporn et al., 1968). A more complex situation has been found in S. epidermidis where four different pentapeptide cross-bridges have been shown to be present (Tipper and Berman, 1969). Each contains glycine and L-serine residues in the ratio 3:2 in a characteristic sequence where glycine is always the initial substituent of the \u025b-amino group of L-lysine. Addition of the amino acids occur at the level of lipid intermediates, the transfer of glycine and serine from their respective tRNAs being catalyzed by membrane-bound enzymes. The incorporation of glycine is independent of that of serine, whereas maximum serine incorporation requires the simultaneous incorporation of glycine. Fractionation of tRNA of S. epidermidis has demonstrated the presence of four glycyl- and four seryl-tRNAs. In each case, all species, including one species of each type that did not participate in protein synthesis, were active in cross-bridge synthesis. The glycyl-tRNA with apparent specificity for peptidoglycan synthesis has been purified and shown to be made up of two distinct iso-accepting species (Roberts et al., 1974). The two sequences define six spaces and the insertion of an additional base in the dehydrouridine loop of one. Thus, S. epidermidis appears to have developed a means of supplying glycine residues for cross-bridge synthesis without involving the machinery of protein synthesis.",

Recently, it was demonstrated that FmhB (FemX) links the first glycine residue to the \u025b-amino group of lysine (Rohrer et al., 1999). Evidence for this function was that, under conditions where fmhB is downregulated, unsubstituted peptidoglycan monomer precursors accumulate. Since FmhB is essential in S. aureus, it represents an ideal drug target. While FmhB incorporates the first glycyl residue, FemA incorporates glycyl residues 2 and 3 (Stranden et al., 1997), and FemB, glycyl residues 4 and 5 (Henze et al., 1993). Although FemA and FemB have a relatively high amino acid sequence identity (40%) and similarity (64%), they are specific and cannot substitute for each other. Null mutants of femAB are barely viable and depend on compensatory mutations for survival (Ling and Berger-B\u00e4chi, 1998). Interestingly, S. aureus contains one glycyl-tRNA gene for protein biosynthesis and three non-proteinogenic glycyl-tRNA genes that are involved in cell wall biosynthesis (Green and Vold, 1993). It is tempting to speculate that the two Fem factors and FmhB may preferentially recognize one of the three glycyl-tRNA species. The site of glycine incorporation in the peptidoglycan is shown in Fig. 10.",

Lif shows similarity to FemA and FemB proteins, which are involved in the biosynthesis of the glycine interpeptide bridge of staphylococcal peptidoglycan. In contrast to Lif, the production of FemA and FemB in S. carnosus does not cause lysostaphin immunity (Thumm and G\u00f6tz, 1997). The putative tRNASer gene located downstream of lss had no recognizable influence on lysostaphin immunity. The lss and lif genes are flanked by insertion sequences, suggesting that S. simulans biovar staphylolyticus received lif and lss by horizontal gene transfer. Recently, it was shown that Lif and Epr lead to incorporation of serine residues into the staphylococcal peptidoglycan interpeptide bridges specifically at positions 3 and 5 and that this incorporation requires the presence of FemA and/or FemB (Ehlert et al., 2000).",

In a second step N-acetyl-glucosamine is glycosidically linked to the N-acetyl-muramyl residue to form undecaprenyl-P-P-N-acetylmuramyl (pentapeptide)-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP (Anderson et al., 1967).

The enzyme has been obtained in soluble form from S. aureus by treatment of membrane preparations with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (Pless and Neuhaus, 1973; Weppner and Neuhaus, 1977). The enzyme is stimulated by the addition of polar lipid fraction containing phosphatidylglycerol.

It was suggested that D-alanyl-D-alanine-dipeptide appeared to be involved in the formation of these cross-linkages. When sublethal concentrations of penicillin were applied, the walls contained an increase in the free amino groups of glycine and an excess of alanine over those walls prepared from organisms grown in the absence of penicillin. These observations were independently confirmed by direct chemical analysis of staphylococcal walls prepared from organisms grown under similar conditions (Tipper and Strominger, 1968). In the presence of penicillin, an increased synthesis of uncross-linked peptide monomer units was observed. These units retained the complete D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the nucleotide precursor and were substituted with the pentaglycine cross-bridge peptide on the \u025b-amino group of L-lysine. During subsequent growth of the organism in the absence of penicillin, these monomer units did not become crosslinked. To explain these observations, it was proposed that incorporation of the newly synthesized disaccharide-peptide occurred at the wall-membrane interface with almost immediate formation of crosslinks to adjacent peptide side chains. In staphylococci, units synthesized in the presence of penicillin could not form crosslinks on the subsequent removal of the antibiotic because continued synthesis of linear uncross-linked peptidoglycan during the initial penicillin treatment moved these units outside the reach of the transpeptidase molecules. These in vivo studies supported the conclusion that crosslinkage in peptidoglycan occurred by means of a transpeptidation reaction inhibited by \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.",

These physiological responses also aid in combating infection. Muramyl peptides activate macrophages and other cells of the immune system to kill cancer cells. It is therefore believed that muramyl peptides and similar agents will become more important as therapeutic agents in the future, owing to increasing resistance of microbes to antibiotics, and increasing numbers of patients with immunodeficiencies (Pabst et al., 1999).",

Characterization of vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strains from all over the world confirmed that emergence of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus is a global issue. A certain group of S. aureus, designated \u201chetero-VRSA,\u201d frequently generates VRSA upon exposure to vancomycin, and is associated with infections that are potentially refractory to vancomycin therapy (Hiramatsu, 2001). Vancomycin resistance is acquired via mutation and cell wall thickening, due to accumulation of excess amounts of peptidoglycan. This seems to be a common resistance mechanism for all VRSA strains isolated so far (Geisel et al., 2001; Komatsuzawa et al., 2002). By exposure to vancomycin, a resistant S. aureus COL mutant was isolated. This mutant showed decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin (8-fold), methicillin (2-fold), macarbomycin (8-fold), and moenomycin (16-fold). Macarbomycin and moenomycin are thought to directly inhibit transglycosylase activity. Characterization of the mutant revealed a thickened cell wall and suppression of penicillin-induced lysis, although the amounts of the five penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs 1, 2, 3 and 4) and MecA, and the profiles of peptidoglycan hydrolases were not altered. Analysis of muropeptide profile and glycan chain length distribution by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed slightly decreased peptide crosslinking and an increased average glycan chain length compared to those of the parent. These results together suggest that a transglycosylase activity was enhanced in the mutant. This may represent a novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in S. aureus (Komatsuzawa et al., 2002).",

The patient received dialysis at an outpatient facility (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002). In June, the patient developed a suspected catheter exit-site infection, and the temporary dialysis catheter was removed; cultures of the exit site and catheter tip subsequently grew S. aureus resistant to oxacillin (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] > 16 \u00b5g/ml) and vancomycin (MIC > 128 \u00b5g/ml). It turned out that the isolate contained the vanA vancomycin resistance genes from enterococci, which is consistent with the glycopeptide MIC profiles. Transfer of vanA genes from Enterococcus faecalis, with which the patient was also infected, to S. aureus is strongly indicated. And to make it worse, the S. aureus isolate contained in addition the oxacillin/methicillin-resistance gene mecA. This report describes the first clinical isolate of S. aureus that is fully resistant to vancomycin (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002). Transfer of van resistance genes from enterococci to S. aureus has long been predicted, with such a conjugative transfer having been demonstrated in vitro (Noble et al., 1992).",

The blanket resistance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is related to the properties of the key component of this resistance mechanism: the \u201cacquired\u201d penicillin-binding protein MecA, which has unusual low affinity for all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Until now, the accepted model of resistance had implied that in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, MecA must take over the biosynthesis of staphylococcal cell wall from the four native staphylococcal PBPs (PBP1, PBP2, PBP3 and PBP4) because the latter become rapidly acylated and inactivated at even low concentrations of the antibiotic. However, recent observations indicate that this model requires revision. Inactivation of the transglycosylase domain, but not the transpeptidase domain, of MecA of S. aureus prevents expression of \u03b2-lactam resistance, despite the presence of the low-affinity MecA. The observations suggest that cell-wall synthesis in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics requires the cooperative functioning of the transglycosylase domain of the native staphylococcal PBP2 and the transpeptidase domain of the MecA (Pinho et al., 2001). There are indications that the mecA gene was acquired from S. sciuri which is, however, uniformly susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Recently, it was shown that the mecA homologue in S. sciuri is hardly expressed but is well expressed by a single mutation in the promoter region and provides methicillin resistance in a susceptible S. aureus strain. This supports the proposition that the mecA homologue ubiquitous in the antibiotic-susceptible animal species (S. sciuri) may indeed be an evolutionary precursor of the methicillin resistance gene mecA of the pathogenic strains of MRSA (Wu et al., 2001).",

When \u03b2-lactam antibiotics saturate the normal set of staphylococcal PBPs, the cell wall is still produced due to the presence of MecA but is drastically hypo-crosslinked.

The mecR1 gene encodes a membrane-bound signal transduction protein (MecR1), while mecI encodes a transcriptional regulator (MecI). Between mecA and mecR1 are the promoters for these genes and an operator region that encompasses the \u221210 sequence of mecA and the \u221235 sequence of mecR1 (Sharma et al., 1998). MecR1 and MecI have high protein sequence homology with the proteins, BlaR1 and BlaI, respectively, that are involved in the inducible expression of the plasmid-mediated staphylococcal \u03b2-lactamase gene, blaZ. MecI is a tight regulator of mecA transcription, and most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics do not efficiently activate MecR1 (Kuwahara-Arai et al., 1996). Consequently, some isolates, referred to as \u201cpre-MRSA,\u201d are methicillin-sensitive despite carrying the mecA gene. However, selective pressure through antibiotic usage has promoted S. aureus isolates that have mutations or deletions in mecI or the mecA promoter/operator region, giving rise to an inactive repressor and constitutive mecA expression. These mutants can display homogeneous (all cells are resistant to high concentrations of methicillin [>128 \u00b5g/liter]) or heterogeneous (only a small minority of cells exhibit high-level methicillin resistance) methicillin resistance phenotypes (Kondo et al., 2001).",

Incubation of S. aureus membranes with CDP-glycerol and ManNAc-[14C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol led to synthesis of (glycerol phosphate)-1-3-ManNAc-[14C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol. In S. aureus (glycerol phosphate)-2-ManNAc-[14C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol as well as (glycerol phosphate)-3-ManNAc-[14C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol served as an acceptor for ribitol phosphate units, but (glycerol phosphate)-ManNAc-[14C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol did not. The covalent attachment of WTA to peptidoglycan does not appear to play a role in the maintenance of the shape or rigidity of the cell wall, since their extraction with trichloracetic acid (TCA) leaves an essentially intact residual wall structure (Baddiley, 1972). While the cell-biological functions of LTA are manifold, not much is known about WTA, which however plays an important role as bacteriophage receptor (Schleifer and Steber, 1974). It was for a long time an open question whether WTA is essential for growth. Recently in the group of A. Peschel, a completely WTA negative deletion mutant was isolated which exhibits normal growth but became resistant to a number of bacteriophages was impaired in adherence to nasal cells, and was completely unable to colonize cotton rat nares (Weidenmaier et al., 2004).",

They hypothesized that the anti-autolytic activity of LTA resides in a sequence of glycerophosphate units and that the negative charges of appropriately spaced phosphodiester groups play a crucial role. This work shows that autolysis is regulated in vivo by the alanine ester content of the LTA, and very likely by the WTA too, which also carries ester bound D-alanine.

One must be aware that frequently these preparations are inhomogeneous and contain decomposed LTA and endotoxins of more than 10 ng of LPS/mg of LTA (Morath et al., 2002). A novel isolation procedure has been worked out that leads to a pure (> 99%) biologically active LTA, allowing the first structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. A comparison with LTA purified by standard techniques revealed that alanine substituents are lost during standard purification, resulting in attenuated cytokine induction activity. In line with this finding, hydrolysis of alanine substituents of active LTA eliminated cytokine induction. Purified S. aureus LTA induced the release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 in human whole blood. Soluble CD14 (sCD14) inhibited monokine induction by LTA but failed to confer LTA responsiveness for IL-6 and IL-8 release of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In a competitive LPS-binding protein (LBP) binding assay, the IC50 of the tested LTA preparations was up to 3230-fold higher than for LPS. The LBP enhanced TNF-\u03b1 release of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon LPS but not LTA stimulation. These data demonstrate a differential role for the serum proteins LBP and sCD14 in the recognition of LPS and LTA (Hermann et al., 2002). There is evidence that the recognition sites of CD14 for LPS and LTA are distinct with a partial overlap. While the maximal achievable monokine release in response to LTA or to LPS was comparable, all LTA induced significantly less IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3. IL-12 substitution increased LTA-inducible IFN-\u03b3 release up to 180-fold, suggesting a critical role of poor LTA-inducible IL-12 for IFN-\u03b3 formation. Pretreatment with IFN-\u03b3 rendered galactosamine-sensitized mice sensitive to challenge with LTA. When compared to LPS, LTA (a major immunostimulatory component of S. aureus) is a weak inducer of IL-12 and subsequent IFN-\u03b3 formation, which might explain the lower toxicity in vivo.",

It was found that local administration of LPS into muscle induced significant leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and emigration in postcapillary venules at the site of injection. Given systemically, LPS caused circulating leukocyte counts to drop dramatically and neutrophil counts to increase in the lung. However, the drop in circulating leukocytes was not associated with leukocyte sequestration to the site of injection (peritoneum) or to peripheral microvessels in muscles. Unlike LPS, LTA had no systemic and very minor local effect on leukocyte-endothelium interactions, even at high doses and prolonged exposure. LPS, but not LTA, potently activated human endothelium to recruit leukocytes under flow conditions in vitro. Endothelial adhesion molecule expression was also increased extensively with LPS, but not LTA. Interestingly, systemic administration of live S. aureus induced leukocyte-endothelial cell responses similar to LPS. PG was able to induce leukocyte-endothelial interactions in muscle and peritoneum, but had no effect systemically (no increase in neutrophils in lungs and no decrease in circulating neutrophil counts). These results demonstrate that: 1) LPS has potent, but divergent local and systemic effects on leukocyte-endothelial interactions; and 2) S. aureus can induce a systemic response similar to LPS, but this response is unlikely to be due to LTA, but more likely to be mediated in part by PG.",

            "text": "One mutant type lacked ester-bound D-alanine in the teichoic acids of both WTA and LTA. As a result the cells carry an increased negative surface charge and bound fewer anionic, but more positively charged peptides and proteins (Peschel et al., 1999). In addition, they became much more sensitive to human defensins, animal-derived protegrins, tachyplesins, and magainin II, and to the lantibiotics gallidermin and nisin. The mutation was located within the dlt genes involved in the transfer of D-alanine into teichoic acids. The fact that high concentrations of magnesium ions compromised the protective properties of D-alanine esters corroborates the hypothesis that the increased negative charge of the cell wall is responsible for the hypersensitivity against positively charged antimicrobial peptides. These results also show that the D-alanine-esterification of teichoic acids (which occurs in many Gram-positive bacteria) is not essential for growth but is essential in the protection against human and animal defense systems (Peschel et al., 1999). The innate immune system is largely based on the release of defensins by immune cells and various tissue cells such as epithelial or endothelial cells. Therefore, dltA mutants should be less virulent than wild type cells. Indeed it was demonstrated that the S. aureus\ndltA mutant lacking D-alanine modifications of teichoic acids is highly susceptible to neutrophil killing and is virulence-attenuated in mice (Collins et al., 2002). These results clearly show that D-alanine-esterification of teichoic acids is a virulence factor.",

They are not only produced by mammals but also by insects and bacteria (Sahl and Bierbaum, 1998). CAMPs represent an important human defense mechanism, protecting skin and epithelia against invading microorganisms and assisting neutrophils and platelets. Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial pathogens have evolved countermeasures to limit the effectiveness of CAMPs, including the repulsion of CAMPs by reducing the net negative charge of the bacterial cell envelope through covalent modification of anionic molecules (e.g., teichoic acids, phospholipids and lipid A). Mutants susceptible to CAMPs are more efficiently inactivated by phagocytes and are virulence-attenuated, indicating that CAMP resistance plays a key role in bacterial infections as reviewed by Peschel (2002).",

Protein A is covalently bound via its C-terminal end to the pentaglycine interpeptide bridge of peptidoglycans and can be released by treatment with lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase. Protein A (Spa) was one of the first proteins shown to be covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan. Protein A is synthesized as a precursor, containing an N-terminal signal peptide, a pro-peptide region, five IgG-binding domains (Moks et al., 1986), a cell-wall spanning region, and finally a 35-residue cell wall sorting (cws) sequence which is conserved in surface anchored proteins of most Gram-positive bacteria (Schneewind et al., 1992). The cws consists of the typical LPXTG motif, which is followed by a hydrophobic domain and a tail of mostly positively charged residues. Mutations at the LPXTG motif lead normally to the secretion of the mutant protein into the extracellular medium. Deletion of this motif prevents cleavage and cell wall anchoring of protein A. The cws sequence of protein A is representative (Fig. 12).",

This adherence is frequently mediated by protein adhesins of the MSCRAMM (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) family, which in many cases are covalently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan (Foster and H\u00f6\u00f6k, 1998). Very likely, surface proteins such as fibronectin-binding protein A and B (FnBPA and FnBPB), the collagen-binding protein Cna, and the fibrinogen-binding proteins, clumping factor A and B (ClfA and ClfB), contribute to adherence and thus to biofilm formation.",

The mprF mutant strain was killed considerably faster by human neutrophils and exhibited attenuated virulence in mice, indicating a key role for defensin resistance in the pathogenicity of S. aureus. In the mprF mutant, the predominant membrane component phosphatidylglycerol lacks L-lysine modification. The structure of lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) is shown in Fig. 14. As this unusual modification leads to a reduced negative charge of the membrane surface, MprF-mediated peptide resistance is most likely based on repulsion of the cationic peptides. Accordingly, inactivation of mprF led to increased binding of antimicrobial peptides by the bacteria. The mprF gene has no similarity with genes of known function, but related genes were identified in the genomes of several pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. MprF thus constitutes a novel virulence factor, which may be of general relevance for bacterial pathogens and represents a new target for attacking multidrug resistant bacteria.",

The various pro-peptides have no striking similarities at the sequence level but are distinguished by their overall hydrophilic character. To get more insight into the function of the pro-peptide, internal deletions within this region were made and analyzed (Demleitner and G\u00f6tz, 1994). The results obtained with these lipase mutants indicate that the SHL pro-peptide may have two functional domains, with each one located in one half of the pro-region. The N-terminal part seems to be important for lipase activity and the C-terminal part, for translocation and stability. A stabilizing effect of the SHL pro-peptide has also been observed in an experiment where OmpA of E. coli is fused to the pre-pro portion of SHL; without the SHL pro-peptide, massive proteolytic degradation occurred after secretion by S. carnosus (Meens et al., 1997). A number of experiments designed to address the question whether the pro-peptide could act also in trans indicated that it has no trans activity. It exerts its beneficial effects on translocation, stability, and activity only intramolecularly (G. Thumm et al., unpublished observation). All studies carried with the pro-peptide speak in favor of an intramolecular chaperon-like function. Maybe it compensates in Staphylococcus and also in Bacillus for the lack of the SecB homolog.",

The proteolytic activities in the supernatant of S. hyicus were analyzed, and two proteases (ShpI and ShpII) were identified; ShpII proved to be involved in pro-SHL processing (Ayora and G\u00f6tz, 1994a; Ayora et al., 1994b).",

The comparison of both genomes was complicated by the fact that the RP62A sequence was not yet annotated. The selected virulence genes were localized on the S. aureus N315 genome (at the DOGAN-Server) by their ID-number and translated into amino acid sequence. The protein sequences were used as queries in a tBLASTn search of the S. epidermidis RP62A genome at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Web site. We also checked the almost finished genome sequence of the food-grade Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 (R. Rosenstein, C. Nerz, and F. G\u00f6tz).

This clearly reflects the difference in the pathogenic potential of the three species representatives and explains why S. aureus is rather an aggressive pathogen, S. epidermidis a mild pathogen and S. carnosus is non-pathogenic. Of the 40 toxin genes in S. aureus, only 3 and 5, respectively, were identified in the S. epidermidis and S. carnosus genome. This finding is in agreement with the earlier observations of decreased toxin production of S. epidermidis and corroborates well with the decreased severity of an S. epidermidis infection. Compared to S. aureus, S. carnosus was also found to have a much decreased number of other potential virulence factors such as exoenzymes and adhesins.",

For each of these binding functions, a corresponding surface-associated protein has been identified. The existence of an S. aureus extracellular matrix binding protein with broad specificity that is capable of binding several extracellular glycoproteins has also been reported (McGavin et al., 1993). The role of some of these proteins in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections has been shown in animal models (Foster and McDevitt, 1994; Moreillon et al., 1995; Flock et al., 1996; Palma et al., 1996).",

The first structure of a pheromone peptide and its biological activity was described in 1998 (Otto et al., 1998). The peptide sequence, DSVCASYF, was derived from AgrD of S. epidermidis. This synthetic octapeptide revealed only autoinducing activity when it contained the thiolactone ring between the central cysteine and the C-terminal carboxyl group (DSVc[CASYF]). The structure of the peptide pheromone of S. epidermidis is shown in Fig. 17. Unmodified peptides showed no activity (Otto et al., 1998). The receptor for the peptide pheromones, AgrC, must be very sensitive since the thiolactones are active at nanomolar concentrations. The N-terminus of the peptide pheromones is crucial for biological activity and specificity (Otto et al., 1998).",

However, while the correct N-terminus and the thiolactone structure were absolute prerequisites for an agr-activating effect in S. epidermidis, inhibition of the S. aureus agr system showed a lesser structural stringency. Another important finding was that the corresponding lactone- and lactam-containing peptides DSVc[SASYF] and DSVc[DprASYF] inhibit the S. aureus agr system, but have lost autoinducing activity in its native S. epidermidis agr system (Otto et al., 1999). The S. epidermidis thiolactone inhibits the agr subgroups 1\u20133 but not 4 (Otto et al., 2001). An explanation for this could be that subgroup 4 thiolactone is very similar to that of S. epidermidis. A series of autoinducing peptide analogues (including the L-alanine and D-amino acid scanned peptides) were synthesized to determine the functionally critical residues within the S. aureus group I. It was found that 1) the group I autoinducing peptide (YSTc[CDFIM]) is inactivated in culture supernatants by the formation of the corresponding methionyl sulfoxide, and 2) that the lactam analogue retains the capacity to activate agr, suggesting that the thiolactone structure, which would allow covalent modification of the AgrC receptor, is not a necessary prerequisite for agr activation. Replacement of the endocyclic amino acid residue (D-aspartate) with alanine converted the group I thiolactone from an activator to a potent inhibitor. The addition of exogenous agr inhibitors to S. aureus decreased the production of TSST-1 and enterotoxin C3, confirming the potential of quorum-sensing blockade as a therapeutic strategy (Dowell et al., 2001).",

This regulation system was first identified by Ambrose Cheung and his colleagues (Cheung et al., 1992). The sar locus consists of the 372-bp sarA preceded by a triple promoter region interspersed with two smaller open reading frames (ORFs) ORF3 and ORF4 (Bayer et al., 1996). The triple promoter system yields three overlapping sar transcripts, sarA, sarC and sarB of 0.56, 0.8 and 1.2 kb, respectively (Fig. 18).

These data suggest that ORF3, and to a lesser degree ORF4, may affect agr expression by modulating SarA protein expression. SarA binds to the P2 promoter region of agr, thus leading to transcription of RNAII and, subsequently, RNAIII, the two major transcripts encoded within the agr locus (Chien et al., 1998).

Deletion of the SarA recognition motif in the promoter regions of agr and hla in shuttle plasmids rendered the transcription of these genes undetectable in agr and hla mutants, respectively. Likewise, the transcription activity of spa (a gene normally repressed by sar) became derepressed in a wildtype strain containing a shuttle plasmid in which the SarA recognition site had been deleted from the spa promoter region. It is assumed that SarA is a regulatory protein that binds to its consensus recognition motif to activate (e.g., hla) or repress (e.g., spa) the transcription of sar target genes, thus accounting for both agr-dependent and agr-independent mode of regulation (Chien et al., 1999).",

ArlS is the sensor protein while ArlR represents the response regulator. An arlS mutant showed pleiotropic effects. It formed a biofilm on a polystyrene surface unlike the parent strain and the complemented mutant strain. Biofilm formation was associated with increased primary adherence to polystyrene, whereas cellular adhesion was only slightly decreased. In addition, the arlS mutant exhibited increased autolysis and altered peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Another effect of the arlS mutant is that the activity of multidrug resistance efflux pump, NorA, is increased (Fournier et al., 2000b). While in the arlS or arlR mutants, the extracellular proteolytic activity, including serine protease activity, is dramatically decreased (Fournier and Hooper, 2000a), and transcription and production of other secreted proteins such as \u03b1- and \u03b2-hemolysins, lipase, coagulase, or the cell-wall bound protein A are increased (Fournier et al., 2001). The arl operon decreases the production of virulence factors by transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding genes. Since the arl mutation did not change spa expression in an agr or sarA mutant, it is suggested that arl acts indirectly on virulence gene expression through agr and sar.

In the course of studies examining the mechanism by which oxygen might regulate toxin production, the srrAB (staphylococcal respiratory response) genes were identified. The genes are homologous to the B. subtilis\nresDE genes. ResD-ResE represents a global regulator of aerobic and anaerobic respiratory metabolism in B. subtilis. The two-component regulatory system SrrA-SrrB very likely acts in anaerobic repression of staphylococcal virulence factors (Yarwood et al., 2001). In srrB mutants, RNAIII synthesis was upregulated while exotoxin TSST-1 synthesis was downregulated under microaerobic conditions and, to a lesser extent, under aerobic conditions as well. At the same time, protein A production was upregulated in microaerobic conditions and decreased in aerobic conditions. Overexpression of srrAB resulted in nearly complete repression of TSST-1 production in both microaerobic and aerobic conditions. It is assumed that SrrA-SrrB acts in the global regulation of staphylococcal virulence factors, and may repress virulence factors under low-oxygen conditions. Furthermore, srrAB may provide a mechanistic link between respiratory metabolism, environmental signals, and regulation of virulence factors in S. aureus (Yarwood et al., 2001). This regulation is mediated in part by agr.",

In B. subtilis, SigB is already present in unstressed cells (e.g., in exponential growth phase), but it is bound and sequestered by the anti-\u03be factor RsbW and therefore unable to interact with the core-enzyme of RNA polymerase (Hecker and Volker, 1998; Scott et al., 2000). A third protein, the anti-anti \u03be factor RsbV, which can also bind to RsbW, accomplishes release of SigB from RsbW. The phosphorylation status of RsbV is critical for its binding to RsbW. In its unmodified form, RsbV forms a complex with RsbW, whereas P-RsbV is unable to bind to RsbW that can then form a complex with SigB. This novel regulatory principle was called \u201cpartner switching\u2019\u2019 (Alper et al., 1994). Antagonistic activities of a kinase and two phosphatases control the phosphorylation status of RsbV. In addition, RsbW is also an RsbV kinase, whereas RsbU (phosphatase) dephosphorylates P-RsbV. Depending on the nature of the growth-restricting factor, RsbU is activated after imposition of environmental (physical) stress.",

Most of the functions of these global regulators have been defined using S. aureus RN6390, which is a representative of the laboratory strain 8325-4. However, RN6390 has a mutation in rsbU that results in a phenotype resembling that of a sigB mutant (Kullik et al., 1998b). For that reason, it remains unclear whether the regulatory characteristics described for RN6390 are representative for clinical isolates. To address this question, mutations were generated in the sarA and agr loci of three laboratory strains (RN6390, Newman, and S6C) and four clinical isolates (UAMS-1, UAMS-601, DB, and SC-1) and tested for collagen binding (cna-expression). The sarA mutants of strains UAMS-1 and UAMS-601 showed an increased capacity to bind collagen, while mutation of agr had little impact. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the increase in collagen binding was due to increased cna transcription. Without exception, an increased production of proteases and a decreased capacity to bind fibronectin was revealed in sarA mutants. Mutation of agr had the opposite effect. Although sarA mutants had slightly reduced fnbA transcription, changes in the ability to bind fibronectin appeared to be more directly correlated with changes in protease activity. Lipase production was reduced in both sarA and agr mutants.",

Resident bacteria are indigenous to the host, maintain relatively stable populations, and increase in numbers mainly by multiplication of those already present. Transient bacteria are derived from exogenous sources, found primarily on exposed skin, and may be easily washed away. Cross-contamination of staphylococci can occur readily where different host species come in contact with one another, but where host specificity is high, the transient organisms will usually be eliminated within several hours or days, unless the normal defense barriers are compromised. Ideally, determination of natural host range should be made with host species that are relatively isolated in nature.

It is found over much of the body surface and produces the largest populations where moisture content and nutrition are high, such as in the anterior nares, axillae, inguinal and perineal area, and toe webs. This species may be found occasionally on other hosts, such as domestic animals, but it is presumably transferred there from human sources. Staphylococcus hominis (Kloos and Schleifer, 1975b) is also prevalent on human skin. Its population size is usually second or equal to S. epidermidis on skin sites where apocrine glands are numerous (e.g., in the axillae and inguinal and perineal areas). It can also colonize the drier regions of skin (e.g., on the extremities) more successfully than other species. Staphylococcus haemolyticus (Schleifer and Kloos, 1975c) shares many of the habitats of S. hominis, but it is usually found in smaller populations. Some individuals may carry unusually large populations of S. haemolyticus. A different subspecies of S. haemolyticus found living on nonhuman primate skin (e.g., Pan, Macaca, Cercocebus, Erythrocebus, Microcebus and Lemur skin) can be distinguished from the human-adapted subspecies on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization (Kloos and Wolfshohl, 1979). Since it is difficult to distinguish colonies of the nonhuman primate S. haemolyticus subspecies from a sibling species, provisionally designated \u201cS. simians,\u201d found also on nonhuman primate skin, adequate enumeration of this subspecies is not yet possible. Staphylococcus warneri (Kloos and Schleifer, 1975b) is found usually in small numbers on human skin, though a few individuals may carry unusually large populations. Staphylococcus warneri is a major species on nonhuman primates, especially on the more advanced Cercopithecoidea and Pongidae. Occasionally, small transient populations of S. haemolyticus or S. warneri may be isolated from domestic animals. Staphylococcus capitis (Kloos and Schleifer, 1975b) produces large populations on the human scalp following puberty. It is also found on other regions of the adult head, e.g., forehead, face, eyebrows, and external auditory meatus in moderate-sized to large populations. The largest populations are found in areas where sebaceous glands are numerous and well developed. Staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus is present on regions of the head in rather small populations and, like S. capitis, may be found only occasionally on other body sites (Bannerman and Kloos, 1991). This subspecies has been isolated from both human and nonhuman primate skin (e.g., Pan skin).",

Here it can exist as a resident or as a transient member of the normal flora. Staphylococcus aureus selectively adheres to nasal epithelial (mucosal) cells (Aly et al., 1981). Nasal carrier rates range from less than 10% to more than 40% in normal adult human populations residing outside of the hospital (Noble and Somerville, 1974). The nasal adherence of S. aureus is significantly greater for carriers of this species than for noncarriers. Staphylococcus aureus subsp. anaerobius is found living on sheep (De la Fuente et al., 1985).",

As a group, these staphylococci are most prevalent on lower primates and mammals. Those species found most frequently on primates include S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii and S. xylosus. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is found usually in small, transient populations on the skin of humans or other primates. This species possesses surface properties that allow it to adhere readily to urogenital cells (Colleen et al., 1979). It may also be isolated from lower mammals and environmental sources. Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. bovis is found in the anterior nares of cows (H\u00e1jek et al., 1996). Staphylococcus cohnii (Schleifer and Kloos, 1975c) is found as a temporary resident or transient on human skin, and S. cohnii subsp. urealyticus (Kloos and Wolfshohl, 1991) is sometimes found on human skin, but it is often one of the major species and subspecies of nonhuman primates, especially the lower primates. The largest populations of subspecies are found living on the Tupaiidae, Prosimii, and Ceboidea (Kloos and Wolfshohl, 1983b). A third subspecies is also found on the Ceboidea. Staphylococcus xylosus (Schleifer and Kloos, 1975c) is often found as a transient on the skin of lower primates and other mammals, and occasionally on birds (Kloos et al., 1976b; Akatov et al., 1985; Devriese et al., 1985). The related species S. kloosii has been found living on a variety of lower mammals including wild marsupials, rodents and carnivores, and less frequently on domestic animals (Schleifer et al., 1984; Kloos, 1980). Staphylococcus arlettae has been isolated from poultry and goats, S. equorum from horses, and S. gallinarum from poultry (Devriese et al., 1983; Schleifer et al., 1984).",

This species can be found in relatively large populations on canine skin and can on occasion be transferred to the skin of human handlers (Kloos et al., 1976b). Staphylococcus intermedius appears to be also indigenous to a variety of other carnivores, including the mink (Mustela; H\u00e1jek et al., 1972; Oeding et al., 1973; H\u00e1jek, 1976a), fox (Vulpes; H\u00e1jek, 1976a), and raccoon (Procyon; Kloos et al., 1976b). It has also been isolated from horses and pigeons (H\u00e1jek and Marsalek, 1971; H\u00e1jek, 1976a). Staphylococcus felis is one of the major species of the domestic cat (Igimi et al., 1989). Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans is a coagulase-positive species, which has been isolated from the external auditory meatus of dogs with ear infections (Igimi et al., 1990). Other coagulase-positive species isolated from animals include S. delphini (Varaldo et al., 1988) and S. lutrae (Foster et al., 1997). Staphylococcus sciuri, S. sciuri subsp. carnaticus and S. sciuri subsp. rodentium have been isolated from a variety of lower mammals and domestic animals (Kloos et al., 1976a; Kloos et al., 1997). In addition, the S. sciuri subspecies may be isolated from human clinical specimens (Marsou et al., 1999). Staphylococcus scuiri appears to be a natural reservoir of methicillin resistance and staphylolytic enzyme genes (Kloos et al., 1997). Their role, if any, in the appearance of methicillin-resistance in the more pathogenic species S. aureus has not yet been determined. Staphylococcus hyicus and S. chromogenes are found predominantly on domestic ungulates such as pigs, cattle and horses (Devriese et al., 1978; Devriese, 1979a; Devriese, 1986; Phillips et al., 1980; H\u00e1jek et al., 1986). Staphylococcus lentus (Schleifer et al., 1983) has been isolated in large populations from domestic sheep and goats (Kloos et al., 1976a; Kloos et al., 1976b), occasionally from other domestic animals (Devriese et al., 1985), and is a major bacterium in saliva of rabbits (Kanda et al., 2001). Members of the newly described genus Macrococcus are found primarily on domestic animals (Kloos et al., 1998a).",

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, S. aureus caused considerable morbidity and mortality as a nosocomial pathogen. Among the major human infections caused by this species are furuncles, carbuncles, impetigo, toxic epidermal necrolysis (scalded skin syndrome), pneumonia, osteomyelitis, acute endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, enterocolitis, mastitis, cystitis, prostatitis, cervicitis, cerebritis, meningitis, bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome, and abscesses of the muscle, skin, urogenital tract, central nervous system, and various intraabdominal organs. In addition, staphylococcal enterotoxin is involved in food poisoning. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains have emerged in the 1980s as a major clinical and epidemiological problem in hospitals. These strains are beginning to spread out of the hospitals and into communities. The origin and future significance of these isolates to the community has yet to be determined.",

The increase in infections by these organisms has been correlated with the wide medical use of prosthetic and indwelling devices and the growing number of immunocompromised patients in hospitals. Infectious processes may result from the introduction of endogenous staphylococci beyond the normal integumentary barriers. Staphylococcus epidermidis appears to have the greatest pathogenic potential and adaptive diversity. This species has been implicated in bacteremia, native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pyoarthritis, peritonitis during continuous ambulatory dialysis, mediastinitis, infections of permanent pacemakers, vascular grafts, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, prosthetic joints, and a variety of orthopedic devices, and urinary tract infections including cystitis, urethritis, and pyelonephritis. Recent reviews have been published on the nature of human infections caused by S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative species (Kloos and Bannerman, 1994; Rupp and Archer, 1994; Crossley and Archer, 1997). Nosocomial methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains became a serious clinical problem in the 1980s, especially in patients with prosthetic heart valves or who had undergone other forms of cardiac surgery (Archer and Tenenbaum, 1980; Karchmer et al., 1983). Staphylococcus epidermidis has also been occasionally associated with mastitis in cattle (Baba et al., 1980; Devriese and De Keyser, 1980; Holmberg, 1986).",

Staphylococcus haemolyticus is the second most frequently encountered species of this group found in human clinical infections. It has been implicated in native valve endocarditis, septicemia, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections, and is occasionally associated with wound, bone, and joint infections. Staphylococcus haemolyticus has been occasionally associated with mastitis in cattle (Baba et al., 1980). Staphylococcus caprae, previously misidentified as S. haemolyticus, S. hominis and S. warneri, is widely distributed in human clinical specimens (Kawamura et al., 1998) and has been implicated in cases of infective endocarditis, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. Staphylococcus lugdunensis has been implicated in native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, septicemia, brain abscess, and chronic osteoarthritis and infections of soft tissues, bone, peritoneal fluid, and catheters, especially in patients with underlying diseases. Staphylococcus schleiferi has been implicated in human brain empyema, osteoarithritis, bacteremia, wound infections, and infections associated with a cranial drain and jugular catheter. This species occurs less frequently than S. lugdunensis in the hospital environment and human infections. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is an important opportunistic pathogen in human urinary tract infections, especially in young, sexually active females. It is considered to be the second most common cause of urinary tract infections, such as acute cystitis or pyelonephritis, in these patients. This species can also produce in men urinary tract infections, which (unlike those in women) occur most commonly in the elderly with predisposing diseases of the urinary tract (Marrie et al., 1982a; Hovelius et al., 1984; Hovelius, 1986). Staphylococcus saprophyticus has occasionally been isolated from wound infections and septicemia (Marsik and Brake, 1982; Fleurette et al., 1987).",

In most cases, patients with these infections had predisposing or underlying diseases that drastically altered their immune systems, and had also experienced surgery or intravascular manipulations. Staphylococcus warneri has been on occasion the etiologic agent of vertebral osteomyelitis, native valve endocarditis, and urinary tract infections in males and females. This species has been associated with mastitis in cattle (Devriese and Derycke, 1979b; Devriese and De Keyser, 1980). Staphylococcus simulans has been associated with human chronic osteomyelitis, pyarthrosis, and bovine mastitis. Staphylococcus felis, a relative of S. simulans, has been isolated from clinical infections in cats, including external ear otitis, cystitis, abscesses, wounds, and other skin infections (Igimi et al., 1989). Staphylococcus capitis has been implicated in endocarditis, septicemia, and catheter infections. Staphylococcus hominis has been associated with human endocarditis, peritonitis, septicemia, and arthritis. Some of the earlier reports indicating an association of this species with infections were in error, owing to the misidentification of phosphatase-negative strains of S. epidermidis as S. hominis. Staphylococcus cohnii has been associated with urinary tract infections and arthritis. Staphylococcus chromogenes, a close relative of S. hyicus, is commonly isolated from the milk of cows suffering from mastitis, although its role as an etiologic agent is questionable (Devriese and De Keyser, 1980; Langlois et al., 1983; Watts et al., 1984). Staphylococcus sciuri subspecies has been isolated from wound, skin, and soft tissue infections (Marsou et al., 1999).",

            "text": "It has been known that Gram-positive and catalase-positive cocci play an important role in the ripening process of dry sausages (Lerche and Sinell, 1955; Niinivaara and Pohja, 1956). The predominant microorganism in fermented meat is S. carnosus, appearing in the early literature as Micrococcus (Schleifer and Fischer, 1982). For more than 50 years, S. carnosus has been used alone or in combination with lactobacilli or pediococci, as a starter culture for the production of raw fermented sausages. One of the main advantages of starter cultures in fermented food processing is that the fermentation and ripening process can be carried out under controlled conditions. In this way, food-poisoning and food-spoilage microorganisms can be suppressed, and the course of the fermentation process and its termination more reliably monitored. During the ripening process of dry sausage, S. carnosus exerts several desired functions (Liepe and Porobic, 1983; G\u00f6tz, 1990). First, S. carnosus gradually reduces nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to ammonia. The advantage of this reaction is that the nitrate concentration is lowered, and that nitrite can combine with myoglobin to form nitrosomyoglobin, which gives the typical red color. As outlined above, nitrite is further reduced to the ammonia thus lowering the unbound nitrite concentration (Neubauer and G\u00f6tz, 1996). Other advantages are development of characteristic flavor, lowering the pH moderately, and the capacity to reduce hydrogen peroxide produced by the catalase-negative lactobacilli, thus preventing odors.",

With the aid of the lipase propeptide, an efficient secretion system has been worked out (G\u00f6tz and Rosenstein, 2001b), which has been used successfully for secretion of heterologous proteins such as the human growth hormone (Sturmfels et al., 2001).",

In S. aureus, lactose and galactose are transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). Internalized lactose 6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by a phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase to yield galactose 6-phosphate and glucose. Galactose 6-phosphate is catabolized through the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway. This pathway most likely exists in staphylococci exhibiting lactose PTS activity. In S. xylosus and probably other staphylococcal species that do not possess a lactose PTS, a permease is responsible for the transport of lactose. Galactose uptake has not been studied in these species. Nonphosphorylated lactose is hydrolyzed by a \u03b2-galactosidase to yield glucose and galactose. Galactose is likely catabolized through the Leloir pathway. In both staphylococcal species, glucose 6-phosphate, produced by a glucose kinase, enters the FBP pathway, the main glycolytic pathway in staphylococci.

When provided with a rapidly metabolizable phosphotransferase system (PTS) sugar (e.g., glucose), bacteria transport it via the PTS. During the process of sugar transport, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the entering sugar, and the PTS proteins are predominantly left in a non-phosphorylated form. Heat-stable phosphocarrier (HPr) kinase senses the presence of glucose in the cell, most probably via intermediates of glycolysis, and phosphorylates non-phosphorylated HPr at Ser-46 in an ATP-dependent manner. By interacting with the central regulator CcpA, P-Ser-46-HPr increases its affinity for cre operators. The complex CcpA/HPr-Ser46-P/cre blocks or activates the transcription of different operons. In the absence of glucose, the activity of HPrK shifts towards P-Ser-HPr phosphatase. Since there is no available sugar and thus no phosphoryl group transfer by the PTS, the HPr protein remains phosphorylated at His-15. Without P-Ser-46-HPr as a co-effector, CcpA shows very low affinity for binding to cre elements, and as a consequence, CcpA does not regulate the catabolic operons. It is assumed that in the presence of high glucose concentrations, glucose is mainly transported independently from the PTS via the permease GlcU in a non-phosphorylated form and is subsequently phosphorylated by glucose kinase, GlkA.",
