The study published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases described a collaboration between our group in Denver (pediatric virologists familiar with the diagnosis and study of coronaviruses) and Maurice Mufson and his colleagues who, at the time, were working in the pediatric wards of Cook County Hospital in Chicago. The objective of the study was to investigate the role that coronaviruses might play in LRTDs in hospitalized infants in an urban environment. The serosurvey we conducted was a supplement to a previous, more-extensive study at Cook County Hospital of traditional respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae conducted by Dr. Mufson and his colleagues [2]. Both studies used serum and respiratory samples obtained from infants <18 months of age hospitalized from 1967 to 1970.",

The first human corona-virus described was isolated from a boy at a boarding school in England, was passaged in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures, and was initially detected by the capacity of culture fluids to produce colds in volunteers at the Common Cold Research Center in Salisbury, England [3]. This extraordinarily cumbersome culture system (organ cultures for viral growth and colds induced in volunteers to detect virus in culture) was used to show that the virus was ether sensitive but was not related to other known ether-sensitive respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. David Tyrrell and his colleagues isolated this virus and described it, and he and June Almeida, an electron microscopist, first examined these infectious fluids and saw particles that looked like avian infectious bronchitis virus [4]. Although coronaviruses were not yet named, they were first characterized and separated from other virus families at that time.",

Other illnesses may have been infections with human metapneumovirus, which recently has been described in multiple studies showing its involvement in LRTDs in infants during winter epidemics [13, 14]. Still other illnesses may have been infections with rhinovirus, since rhinovirus is a common pathogen with a spectrum of disease similar to that of the traditional human coronaviruses. The epidemiology of rhinovirus infections is only now coming into focus, because of the application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to their diagnosis [11].",

During the 1960s and 1970s, the identification of coronaviruses in clinical samples was a formidable task that required intensive attention to the welfare of tissue cultures over the course of 3 or 4 weeks and the ability to detect subtle cytopathic effects on a background of gradually dying cell monolayers. It was, incidentally, with skills like this that rubella virus [15, 16], cytomegalovirus [17, 18], varicella virus [19], and numerous other viruses were first discovered. In this respect, there is a striking contrast with the SARS coronavirus, which appears to grow quite readily in Vero cell tissue culture [20], but even traditional group I and II human coronaviruses (those related to OC43 and 229E) are easier to detect now because of the application of PCR to clinical samples [21], and the spectrum of disease associated with genetically related strains has become clearer over the past decade.",

With the perspective of time, a role for traditional human coronaviruses in pneumonia of children seems easier to accept, largely because, over the years, other researchers have linked coronaviruses with a small proportion of more-severe respiratory illness in various hosts: LRTDs in young adults [22], exacerbations of asthma of adults and children [23, 24], acute decompensation of very premature infants [25, 26], pneumonia in the immunocompromised host [27], extensive respiratory symptoms in adults with chronic bronchitis, and hospitalizations and deaths due to pneumonia in frail elderly subjects [28\u201330]. Nevertheless, these viruses, although clearly possessing some pathogenicity, do not generally produce severe illness. In this respect, they are totally different from the SARS coronavirus, which is a different sort of pathogen altogether. Moreover, many animal coronaviruses are also entirely different pathogens: some of them, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis of swine, and feline peritonitis virus, to name a few, cause major diseases in animals, and SARS coronavirus shares more features in common with them than with the illnesses caused by traditional human coronaviruses. The results described in the 1974 article in The Journal of Infectious Diseases [1] are an example of the severe end of the disease spectrum associated with a virus group of limited pathogenicity.",
