More than 50 serotypes of IBV have been documented since the first virus was isolated from birds exhibiting respiratory symptoms in the United States in 1931 [3]. Extensive genetic diversity of IBV strains worldwide renders vaccines largely ineffective, because of poor or no cross-protection between different IBV serotypes [4], [5]. Thus, finding an effective antiviral drug or agent is imperative for the prevention of IBV infection.",

Several reports have confirmed that traditional Chinese herbs effectively inhibit the replication of various viruses [6], [7], [8]. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, Astragalus mongholicus, have been widely used immunopotentiators [9], [10], [11]. Recently, several studies have shown that supplementation with APS can inhibit replication of several animal viruses, including H9N2 avian influenza virus [12], foot and mouth disease virus [13], Newcastle disease virus [14], and infectious bursal disease virus [15]. However, the effect of APS on IBV replication remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the antiviral effects ofAPS against IBV by utilizing several in vitro approaches.",

For example, Lv et al. found that treatment with APS significantly reduced mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in colon tissues of mice with colitis [28]. Wang et al. reported that administration of APS significantly downregulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 (P < 0.05) in LPS-treated Caco2 cells [24].
