            "text": "Worldwide, annual epidemics of viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) constitute a major health burden. Especially influenza is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. In the temperate climate zone, the seasonal appearance of influenza and other respiratory viruses is well described [6], [7], [8], yet the driving force behind this seasonal variation remains enigmatic to a large extent. Several factors that might explain the seasonality have been suggested, including antigenic drift and shift in influenza viruses, host immune response, social behaviour including indoor-crowding during poor weather as well natural occurring fluctuations of climate factors and solar-radiation [9], [10], [11], [12]. Of particular interest is the role of meteorological factors as key players behind the marked seasonality in the temperate regions, where the influenza peak is associated with a cold and dry climate, whereas humid and rainy conditions seem to favour influenza activity in tropical regions [13].",

However, during the past decade, focus has shifted towards the role of humidity. Low relative humidity (RH; which describes the water content in a gas, relative to the maximum capacity of water vapor that a gas can hold, at a given temperature) has been shown to contribute to the transmission and survival of influenza virus [18], [19], [20], [21]. The plausible explanation for this is that low RH leads to evaporation of aerosolized virus particles, allowing them to remain airborne for an extended period of time [17]. However, in the temperate climate zone, outdoor RH reaches maximum levels during wintertime, suggesting that the variation regarding this parameter may not fully explain seasonality.",

The main finding was a strong association between a drop in temperature and the start the influenza season and that low outdoor temperature was associated with the weekly incidence of several respiratory viruses, except for HRV or HEV. We propose that reduced size of aerosol droplets due to evaporation by reduced temperature (and vapor pressure) during cold outdoor conditions may extend the duration of time when such infectious droplets remain airborne and thus increases the chance of infecting new hosts [17].",

Multivariate analysis revealed an association between weekly incidence of influenza and outdoor temperature, independent of other weather factors and the curves displaying the weekly incidence revealed that a quick drop below zero preceded the start of the annual epidemic each of the examined seasons in our setting. Jaakkola et al. recently found that a drop in temperature during the three preceding days increased the risk for influenza virus transmission, however this study had a limited positive sample size and used daily averages. In order to further analyse the relationship between the start of IFA epidemics and climate factors we also investigated the weekly changes of meteorological parameters during outbreak and we found that alterations in temperature (and hence, vapor pressure) precedes the increase of IFA infections by one week in a similar geographical setting. This suggests that declines in outdoor temperature may be an important predictor for the IFA outbreaks, which may serve to kick-start the annual epidemic. It is important to notice that there is a relatively strong covariance between outdoor temperature and AH (expressed as VP in our study) and that they are strongly connected. We believe that both are critical for shaping conditions favourable for aerosol spread, but whether they should be considered as separate factors or as one connected entity in epidemiological models are up for further studies.",

Our observations suggest that AH is more strongly associated with IFA onset and activity than RH. In fact, we observed slightly higher RH during winter compared to the rest of the year, arguing against that RH would explain the marked seasonality, and this has also been questioned by reports by others [23], [24]. Even though outdoor RH is higher during the winter months in temperate climate, the amount of water vapor that a unit of air can hold is significantly smaller when the temperature is low, meaning that the air is very dry in terms of AH. Indoor heating wintertime causes RH to drop heavily and creates an even dryer indoor environment that might further favour transmission of influenza viruses by reducing the size of aerosol particles through evaporation. Therefore, maintaining a higher level of humidity indoors might help reducing transmission [39].",

            "text": "In our series, RSV peaked during late wintertime (February to March) all seasons while IFB appeared biennially. An association between climate and RSV as well as IFB has been reported previously [30], [31], [32], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Since our observation period was limited we can only conclude that IFB appears irregularly in our geographical area, which is consistent with the finding from a 10 year-surveillance conducted by Weigl et al. [6]. Our findings suggest that temperature and vapor pressure may influence activity of RSV, but also IFB once the prerequisites for an annual epidemic are fulfilled. We believe that the observed negative correlation between IFB and RH may be a coincidence. A study by Gaunt et al. found marked winter seasonality of HCoV in a similar geographic setting [35] and in the temperate climate zone HMPV also peaks during wintertime or early spring [33], [36], [44], [45] whereas an inverse pattern has been observed closer to the equator [46]. In agreement with these reports both HCoV and HMPV activity was strongly associated with low temperature and VP in our study. PIV appeared irregularly with a single episode of high incidence in the spring of 2013. A previous study in the same geographical area also found PIV to peak during springtime [8]. We found a weaker correlation between PIV and VP compared to IFA, and we believe that PIV may be less dependent of meteorological factors. HRV and HEV appear frequently across seasons in our study. HRV have a tendency to accelerate during autumn in the temperate zone [43], [47]. We speculate that infections caused by HRV and HEV, which are non-enveloped viruses and therefore more robust than most of the respiratory viruses, may be transmitted via large droplets or close contact rather than via small-aerosolized particles and therefore be less dependent on climate factors for spread. The association between HRV incidence and weekly average wind speed should be interpreted with caution since weekly average may be a suboptimal way to quantify the impact of wind. It could however reflect increased transmission due to indoor crowding during longer periods of windy climate.",

Although the relatively large sample size have been analysed at the same laboratory, a few specimens were collected as far as 100 km from the laboratory. Any differences in temperature and humidity are likely to be small within this geographical area and we believe that this factor would not change our findings in any substantial way. We choose to study weekly averages in temperature and humidity, in order to exclude the risk of the turbulence given by the swift alterations that may occur on a daily basis. The number of seasons included in this study was too few to justify the use of monthly averages.",
