Not only is CFD a well-established environmental research tool to enhance our predictive power, it is also a recognized design tool for urban planners and designers (Murakami 2006) . With CFD, highly unsteady and threedimensional turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary can be simulated. In the following sections, three main CFD methods, which are Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) are discussed. Compared with laminar flows, the fluctuation of turbulent flows is on a broad range of spatial and temporal scales (Ferziger and Peric 2002; Murakami 2006) . In DNS, all spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence motions are directly computed by Navier-Stokes equations without any approximations by turbulence models (Ferziger and Peric 2002) . Because of this, DNS is the most accurate among all of the simulation methods. However, using the DNS model to totally reproduce turbulence is extremely expensive. On the other hand, the LES method separates the turbulence flow into large and small scales, and only focuses on the \"large eddy\" that is larger than grid size. Small eddies, such as eddies in Kolmogorov scales, are eliminated from the solution to reduce computational cost. The unresolved scales of turbulence flows are approximated by the sub-filter-scale turbulence models (Meneveau and Katz 2000; Kleissl and Parlange 2004) . As a result, LES is computationally cheaper than DNS, and has been used as a research tool in a wide range of engineering applications to simulate high Reynolds flows, such as simulations of the neutral atmospheric boundary layer (Letzel et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 286, "text": "(Murakami 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 696, "end": 721, "text": "(Ferziger and Peric 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 722, "end": 736, "text": "Murakami 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 902, "end": 927, "text": "(Ferziger and Peric 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1494, "text": "(Meneveau and Katz 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1521, "text": "Kleissl and Parlange 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1774, "text": "(Letzel et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outline of CFD Numerical Methods for Neutral Turbulence Flows"}, {"text": "Unlike the DNS and LES methods, which are time-dependent approaches, the RANS method does not directly compute any turbulence by Navier-Stokes equations, but rather approximates the turbulence flows by decomposing solution variables in DNS and LES into the time-averaged and fluctuating components:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outline of CFD Numerical Methods for Neutral Turbulence Flows"}, {"text": "where f is the instantaneous value of variables, such as velocity, in the Navier-Stokes equations, < f > is the mean value, and f is the fluctuating value.

The profiles from 0 to 50 m are enlarged in Fig. 5 .17b to show airflow that is closer to the ground. Our results indicate that the wind environment at the pedestrian level is not affected by building height, but rather is significantly influenced by building morphology in the podium layer.

Different simulation methods and turbulence models are compared based on the literature review. The \u03ba \u2212 \u03c9 SST turbulence model is applied in this study. Results of the comparison between CFD simulation results and wind tunnel data suggest that the \u03ba \u2212 \u03c9 SST turbulence model is accurate enough to simulate the turbulent flows caused by shape-edged buildings. Unlike the wind field studies in real urban areas, our study designs a number of parametric models to test the different modification effects on pedestrian-level air flow in street canyons. Compared with other parametric studies in which only one or two buildings are included, this study employs computational modeling in the urban scale to include the effects of the urban context. This study derives a wind speed classification based on the outdoor thermal comfort, as well as uses the relative frequency of the pedestrian-level wind speed and the vertical profiles of the mean wind velocity to evaluate the natural ventilation performance in street canyons. Cross-comparison results suggest that the sensitivity of the wind performance is not the same across different modifications of building morphology. Relevant planning and design strategies are provided based on the findings of this study as follows:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "(1) Street grid orientation in grid planning is a significant parameter in urban natural ventilation performance. Main streets should be arranged along the prevailing wind direction. Efficiency of the design strategies also depends on the prevailing wind direction, as demonstrated in the results in Sect. 5.3. (2) The mean building height determines the z 0 + z d value in high-density urban areas, while urban ventilation performance from the pedestrian perspective mostly depends on the pedestrian-level building porosity. (3) Overall, decreasing the site coverage ratio increases the pedestrian-level natural ventilation performance. Comparison of Cases 3, 4, and 5 provides a more detailed understanding. The wind profiles in Cases 3 and 4 suggest that building setbacks along the street across the prevailing wind direction (Case 3) are less useful in high-density urban areas than building separations along the prevailing wind direction (Case 4). In contrast, the wind profiles in Case 5 ( Fig. 5 .8) suggest improvement of the pedestrian-level wind speed on the leeward outdoor space if building separation is incorporated with building setback. (4) Wind permeability in the podium layer is very useful in leading airflow into deep street canyons. The building void between towers and podiums in Case 6 significantly accelerates turbulent flows in the podium layer, and the stepped podiums lead airflow into the pedestrian level. Airflow across the building void (10 m) is numerically presented by the red lines in Fig. 5 .8. The mean wind speed on the leeward outdoor space can be improved to recreate the condition in Case 1903. (5) Air passages should be arranged as close to the ground level as possible. Poor wind performance in Case 7 indicates that wind permeability in towers does not improve the pedestrian-level wind environment. Furthermore, compared with the profiles of Case 6, wind passage in the podium layer should incorporate the stepped podium to benefit the pedestrian-level wind environment, or the openings on the facade should be opened from the ground. (6) Building setback, separation, and building permeability are useful in improving the pedestrian-level wind environment. However, the efficiency levels of these strategies differ. The consideration of urban area as a whole is important as natural ventilation performance in urban area results from the integral effects of buildings. Thus, air paths in these areas can be efficiently established and organized by applying different strategies to improve building porosity. Combining strategies (i.e., urban planning + building design) is recommended for the doubled benefits and efficiency over any single strategy. Planners and architects should choose appropriate strategies based on the actual design requirements and the insights from this Chapter.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 998, "end": 1004, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1530, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "(7) The current study gives scientific insights into the urban ventilation section of the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (HKPSG) (HKPD 2011), as the Guidelines stress the importance to design urban breezeway and air path with nonbuilding areas and building setbacks from streets.
