This defi nition challenges the more restricted notions of human security and is centred on the principles that human security is a universal concern, its components are interdependent, that it is best achieved through prevention rather than intervention and that it is people-centred (UNDP 1995 : 232-34) .",

At the close of 2009, it was reported that 59% of the total number of HIV/AIDS cases in China were caused by sexual transmission, with heterosexual transmission accounting for 44.3% of those infections and homosexual transmission accounting for 14.7% (Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China 2010 : 22) . Of the total reported number of HIV/AIDS cases, 30.8% of PLWHA in the PRC are women demonstrating the vulnerability of women to HIV transmission and increasing the concerns that the country is in a growth period (SCAWCO and UNAIDS 2007 : 4) . Also concerning is that since 2005, sexual transmission has been the fastest growing mode of HIV transmission in China (Hong et al. 2009 ) .",

Since 2005, it has estimated that MTCT of HIV accounted for approximately 1.3-1.5% of the total number of new HIV cases (National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control 2006 : 2; Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China 2010 : 23). According to the United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) MTCT rates in excess of 1% demonstrate that a HIV/AIDS epidemic meets the criteria for the categorization of a 'generalized epidemic' as MTCT highlights rates of HIV among women in the general population who do not belong to any particular high-risk group (Gill et al. 2007 ) . Therefore, the above results are further evidence that China's overall HIV/AIDS epidemic has moved into its growth period . If effective prevention and control measures are not introduced prior to or during the growth period, and the country's HIV/ AIDS epidemic moves into the 'rampant prevalence period', large scale HIV transmission is inevitable. Although rates of HIV among the general population remain low in the PRC, with rates believed to be between 0.042% and 0.071% (Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China 2010 : 5), the spread of HIV through heterosexual intercourse among the general population is very much a warning that the numbers of PLWHA may soon explode across the country. If this occurs, it would make the epidemic very diffi cult to prevent and control and Chinese women's vulnerability to HIV transmission will increase substantially, particularly because the prevalence rate of HIV among the general population would increase rapidly.",

A society's gender roles have considerable infl uence on three main areas of HIV/AIDS vulnerability; accurate sexual and reproductive health knowledge, sexual passivity and aggression, and promiscuity. In addition, 'enabling environments' such as social, cultural, political and economic environments, can all fuel HIV vulnerability among women and these vulnerabilities are largely the result of gender inequality (Feinstein and Prentice 2000 ) .",

These responses are alarming because they ignore the patterns of HIV transmission to women in much of the rest of the world, whereby women in the general population have been found to be extremely vulnerable to HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS. 4 However, while Interviewee C's organization did not incorporate a gendered response into its overall HIV prevention and treatment programs, her responses indicated that the intersection of gender and HIV vulnerability was being considered (2003, pers. comm., 22 August) . Interviewee C believed that gender and economics were important issues in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, even though they were not yet widely recognized or were a part of China's offi cial HIV/AIDS response and policies.

Also, the educational level of women is lower than their male counterparts, and unemployment rates are a great deal higher. This has a lot to do with remaining views on the role of women, which follow closely with the traditional stereotypes of women as wives, devoted to house and raising children. They are still seen in this caregiver role. Women are also restricted in their access to information, so this also makes them vulnerable because they don't know what HIV/AIDS is or how to prevent it (Interviewee C 2003, pers. comm., 22 August). Responses from other interviewees also demonstrated that organizations were aware of the links between gender and HIV vulnerability. When asked what factors he believed increased Chinese women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, Interviewee E (2003, pers. comm., 27 August), a health specialist for an INGO that included HIV/ AIDS in its health framework, responded that he felt unemployment and low education levels were key factors because they led to economic insecurity that could lead women to prostitution. He stated that particularly in rural China, female school enrolments were much lower than those of males, and that this adversely affected women's employment opportunities. He also stated that women were further disadvantaged because they were not paid the same as men for equal work. Also, because many women had been laid-off from their jobs in northeast China, due to factory closures and cutbacks, many of these women had been forced to enter the sex industry as a means of survival (Interviewee E 2003, pers. comm., 27 August) .",

Interviewee A, who was a Senior Programme Offi cer for an overseas aid agency (2003, pers. comm., 21 August) , offered two possible reasons for this oversight. Firstly, she believed a gendered response was not a major component of China's HIV/AIDS strategy because 'gender issues are generally addressed by the All China Women's Federation (ACWF) or the Regional Women's Commission (RWC)' (Interviewee A 2003, pers. comm., 21 August) . Secondly, at the time of fi eldwork, ordinary Chinese women among the general population were not widely recognized or targeted as being vulnerable to HIV transmission (Interviewee A 2003, pers. comm., 21 August). Therefore, according to Interviewee A, because women among the general population were not regarded as a vulnerable group it made little sense to organizations such as hers to engender their HIV/AIDS prevention strategies.",

This reluctance could in part be because of the historical background of the ACWF. This organization was one of the fi rst mass organizations formed by the Chinese Communist Party following the 1949 Liberation and was the impetus for the social, legislative and policy changes aimed at improving the status of women in the 1950s. While it was temporarily disbanded during the Cultural Revolution , the organization was fully reformed in 1978 and since that time it has continued its earlier work on improving the status of women in China through legislative and social change (Howell 2003 ) . Therefore, the ACWF has had a monopoly on women's issues in China for much of China's post-Liberation period.",

Therefore, Interviewee A's reasons for the lack of consideration of gender in offi cial responses to HIV/AIDS in China demonstrates that there are serious impediments which need to be addressed. It would seem there is a reluctance to either tackle gender issues by non-ACWF organizations as they may perceive a turf war confl ict, or simply because they feel that such issues are best handled by the ACWF. Whatever the reason, because such organizations are reluctant to incorporate gendered responses into their HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment campaigns women have been marginalized in the mainstream responses to HIV/AIDS in China even though international experience has repeatedly demonstrated that if they are left unresolved, gender vulnerabilities to HIV transmission fuel HIV epidemics.",

Nonetheless, the reluctance of international organizations like Interviewee A's to incorporate gendered responses was concerning as in many AIDS-stricken countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, women among the general population have been found to be at substantial risk of contracting HIV through non-commercial heterosexual intercourse (UNAIDS, UNFPA and UNIFEM 2004 : 1-2).

However, surveys conducted by some INGOs have revealed that as much as 20-40% of China's population has no knowledge of HIV/AIDS at all (Park 2003 : 54; UNAIDS 2002 : 43) . While recent fi gures suggest this has changed and that 'basic' 5 HIV/AIDS awareness is in the vicinity of between 74.5% and 85.1% for urban and rural residents and migrant workers, there still remain pockets of the population who lack accurate HIV/AIDS knowledge and awareness (Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China 2010 : 7). One of the reasons often cited for this lack of knowledge is that due to China's size and regional variances in language dialects, country-wide HIV/ AIDS education campaigns are diffi cult to conduct. Interviewee F (2003, pers. comm., 9 September) , the Division Director of a government organization that examines HIV/AIDS related issues, confi rmed this when she stated 'because China is so large\u2026 not everyone knows about AIDS [and] the information has not spread to very remote areas, [therefore] more work will be done there'. These factors seriously complicate the dispersal of accurate HIV/AIDS knowledge, and are a key area that the Chinese government must overcome to effectively respond to China's growing HIV/AIDS epidemic.

A study by the Sex Sociology Institute of the People's University of China found that in people over 40 years of age, 45.7% of men and 24.1% of women reported they had engaged in premarital sex . However, for the 25-29 year old age bracket, rates were signifi cantly higher with 72.2% of men and 46.2% of women reporting they had engaged in premarital sex (Xia 2004 : 14) . Even though premarital sex is occurring, sex education and the supply of contraceptive devices to young, unmarried people remains a contentious issue.",

There was also growing debate over abstinence-based sex education as opposed to sex education that promotes 'safer sex', such as using condoms, with the proponents of the abstinence-based sex education style hoping to see a return to 'traditional morality' (Xia 2004 : 15) . In the meantime, no real steps have been made in implementing a comprehensive sex education curriculum into Chinese schools. As a result, many university students in the PRC have 'alarmingly low' levels of AIDS knowledge and self-perceived risk (Wu et al. 2007 : 683) , refl ecting the need for a national sex education curriculum. This is concerning as HIV in China is most prevalent among people in the 20-29 year old age bracket, with this group accounting for 56% of China's overall HIV/AIDS cases (Ma et al. 2009 : 249) . However, these rates of infection are unsurprising when one considers that surveys of university students have found that only 15% of those who were sexually active reported 100% condom use in their sexual encounters during the year prior to the study (Ma et al. 2009 : 256) .",

Although young unmarried people can access contraceptive services in China, information and advice about contraception is somewhat limited. This is because the National Family Planning Programme only targets married couples for the delivery of contraception information and devices. Furthermore, studies conducted in rural and urban Shanghai found that when premarital sex resulted in pregnancy, most pregnancies were unintended, and were usually because the couple had not used contraceptives (Qian et al. 2004 ) . Surveys conducted on confi dence levels when purchasing condoms found that only 44.3% of women compared to 85.5% of men felt confi dent buying condom s (Ma et al. 2009 : 257) .

The change refl ects the dual role of condoms in preventing conception, but also as a means of preventing the transmission of STIs/HIV (Yuan et al. 2003 : 17) . Interviewee F acknowledged this change, adding that her organization stressed '\u2026using condoms is benefi cial for men and women, from the point of view of health, because men and women will both benefi t from the[ir] use ' (2003, pers. comm., 9 September) . However, a recent study has reinforced that condoms are still primarily perceived by some university students as pregnancy prevention rather than protection against STIs/HIV. The study found that 95% of respondents identifi ed condoms as protection against pregnancy while only 30-41% regarded them as protection against STIs/HIV (Ma et al. 2009 : 256) .

In addition, many unmarried men preferred not to use condoms because they felt their 'sexual and reproductive ability' was proven if their partners became pregnant ( 2004 : 22). Furthermore, many men continue to view their sexual relationship with their wife as procreation, whereas sexual pleasure is derived from commercial sex workers.

Increasing condom usage rates among the general population is further complicated because many Chinese women use intra-uterine devices (IUDs) or have had surgeries such as tubal ligation or hysterectomies to avoid further pregnancies, causing condoms to be viewed as unnecessary. 6 Therefore, Interviewee B believed that it was imperative condoms be promoted as a sexual health device within marriage and committed relationships in addition to persons engaging in premarital sex or infi delity.",

This is not surprising considering many sex workers lack adequate HIV/AIDS information in the fi rst instance and secondly because condom use in sexual exchange generally involves a 'discount' due to both decreased sensitivity and male sexual pleasure.

Furthermore, other sex workers who wanted to use condoms in the commercial sexual exchange were prevented from doing so because they lacked 'the power to insist on the use of condom s with their clients' . In most instances, it is the client who decides whether or not a condom is used in commercial sexual exchange, again refl ecting the disempowered status sex workers face (Kanabus 2004 ) . Hence, poor HIV/AIDS awareness and female disempowerment facilitates such 'high-risk' behaviour, and this situation reinforces the need for widespread public education campaigns to better educate the entire Chinese population on HIV/AIDS prevention and risk. This is particularly pressing considering that commercial sex is the leading contributing factor for the transmission of HIV through heterosexual intercourse (Hong et al. 2009 ) . However, such an education campaign must contain accurate and appropriate messages about HIV/ AIDS and HIV prevention.",

This argument was reinforced by Dik\u00f6tter, who claimed that AIDS was initially described in offi cial discourse as an 'evil from abroad', and that it was widely believed that the 'superior immune system' of the Chinese, combined with their 'Neo-Confucian values', would mean that HIV/AIDS would not infect the general population but would largely remain limited to homosexual men and sex workers who serviced foreign clients ( 1997 : 78-79).

This false sense of security was refl ected in the section on 'Self-perceived risk of contracting HIV/AIDS' in a study conducted by the Futures Group ( 2004 : 17) . This study explored the levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge among respondents and their attitudes and behaviours towards AIDS related issues. The study found that 78% of those surveyed believed themselves to be at 'low-risk' of contracting HIV/AIDS, and that the main reason for such a belief was because very few of the respondents (2%) reported that they knew of a PLWHA or a person who had died from AIDS. Therefore, because they themselves had not known anyone affected by HIV/AIDS, their perception of the virus was that it is something that affects the 'other' or that it only affected 'degraded people' (Futures Group 2004 : 17) . Consequently, because they did not fi t either category, they believed themselves to be of little risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Self-perceived risk has also been skewed by the government's HIV/AIDS prevention policies, which have long been focused on 'high-risk' groups. It can be argued that current prevention strategies actually put women at risk because they stress partner reduction over condom use as an effective way to avoid HIV transmission. The 'one partner' or 'faithfulness' prevention messages, which teach both men and women to protect themselves against HIV transmission by limiting the number of partners they have to one, has been described by UNAIDS as lulling people into a 'false safety' (UNAIDS 2002 : 44) . Surveys that have been conducted in China among traditional 'low-risk' groups such as married women, who do not engage in any of the traditionally recognized 'risky practices' conducive to HIV transmission, have found that most women believe that limiting the number of partners they have to one is much better protection against HIV transmission than using condom s (UNAIDS 2002 : 44) . However, such a measure is dependent upon their spouse having a negative status upon the commencement of the relationship, and not engaging in practices that may cause them to contract HIV for the duration of the sexual relationship.",

In a study of Chinese women who contracted HIV from their husbands, none of the women interviewed were aware of their husband's HIV+ status prior to their own diagnoses. In addition, one husband commented that he felt women 'had little choice if their husbands insisted they do so [have sex], inasmuch as the fact that \"we are still married\" legitimized their sex' (cited in Zhou 2008 : 1119). Therefore, the government sponsored campaigns in China that primarily focus on individuals reducing 'risky practices' or limiting the number of sexual partners they have to one, are out of step with reality. Instead, HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns also need to focus on providing easily accessible sexual and reproductive health information for both men and women, and making condoms available and accessible to all sexually active persons.

Another study, which was conducted in India, another region where HIV/AIDS is growing at an alarming rate, reveals that 91% of HIV positive women surveyed, who had contracted HIV from sexual intercourse, also reported that their only sexual partner was their husband (Feinstein and Prentice 2000 : 22) . These fi ndings support the results of an earlier study conducted in 1989 which also found the majority of HIV positive women who had contracted HIV through heterosexual intercourse, had also contracted HIV/AIDS from their only sexual partner, their husband. The researchers in this instance concluded that often 'condom use was more effective in preventing HIV infection than was limiting the number of partners' (Berger and Vizgirda 1993 : 62). difference would lead to the eradication of outdated sexual stereotypes regarding men and women. However, patriarchal views still permeate Chinese society and overall Chinese men retain their position of gender privilege, often refl ected in the power dynamics of heterosexual relationships.",

Since its introduction, there has been a strong resurgence in son preference , especially in the rural areas where sons play an important role in continuing the family lineage, contributing to the family labour force and their fi lial duty to provide for their parents in old age ( Croll et al. 1985 ; Croll 2000 ; Chan et al. 2002 ) . In some areas of China, the reemergence of son preference has caused there to be strong pressure on women to give birth to a son and failure to do so can lead to domestic violence and even divorce. This is because women are wrongfully blamed over the sex of the child due to poor knowledge on the biological determinants of the sex of the fetus and also because it is believed to be 'the duty of a Chinese wife to bear a son to continue the family name' (Chan et al. 2002 : 427) .",

The ACWF has found that reported cases of domestic violence occur in approximately 30% of Chinese families, with 32.5% of abused women being beaten around four times per month (Xinhua 2000 ) . Female suicide rates are also high in the PRC, refl ecting female insecurity there. Of the total number of female suicides worldwide, 56% occurred in China (Renwick 2002 : 383) . In addition, while the urban rate of female suicide is estimated to be in the vicinity of 15.9 per 100,000 women, in rural areas the fi gures have reached 78.3 per 100,000 women, clearly demonstrating a rural/urban divide in female suicide rates in China (HRIC, cited in Renwick 2002 : 383) . A report by the BBC echoed these fi ndings, and stated that many rural women are highly successful in their suicide attempts because they used pesticides and rat poisons to commit suicide (BBC 2002 ) .",

In societies where there exists 'a cultural ethos that violence is a valid means of solving inter-personal disputes' (Whelan 1999 : 11) , such as in the domestic spheres, women may avoid discussing the use of condoms or fi delity issues with their partners for fear of violent response. The fear of violent retribution was identifi ed by women from a range of countries such as Guatemala, Jamaica and Papua New Guinea as being the reason why they did not try to negotiate condom usage with their sexual partners (Feinstein and Prentice 2000 : 24) . Women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS is heightened by male aggression because it can often be linked to the occurrence of sexual coercion, non-consensual sex and sexual violence against women. For many women, decisions about their sexual behaviour are denied to them because they are forced into sexual intercourse against their will. This is applicable both inside and outside of relationships. In such instances, condom usage is unlikely, so women's vulnerability to HIV transmission is increased (Irwin et al. 2003 : 31) . Therefore, the accounts given above of high rates of domestic violence and female suicide demonstrate that there are a great number of women in the general population who are facing increased HIV vulnerability due to their unhealthy domestic environment.",

Interviewee A (2003, pers. comm., 21 August) attributed this to the fact that these two provinces 'have a high number of poor farmers and unemployed' so they sell women for fi nancial rewards. Interviewee A also stated that the 'traffi c of women in China is generally restricted to marriage, whereas traffi cking outside of China is generally for prostitution'. In saying this, the interviewee believed that the traffi c of women , while bad, would not increase the likelihood of HIV transmission because the women were sold as 'brides', not sex workers (Interviewee A 2003, pers. comm., 21 August) . The belief that traffi cked 'brides' are not particularly vulnerable to HIV transmission was also shared by Interviewee E (2003, pers. comm., 27 August) . However, this belief demonstrates a serious lack of understanding of human traffi cking as members of the traffi cking gangs sometimes rape the women, regardless of them being traffi cked as 'brides' or as sex workers . Furthermore, prospective husbands are sometimes allowed to have intercourse with the women before purchasing them, in order to decide which woman will become their 'bride' and also so that they can bargain the price of the woman ( South China Morning Post , cited in Jaschok and Miers 1994 : 264) . Clearly, the rape of these women by numerous men, including their 'husband', increases their vulnerability to HIV transmission. In addition, the likelihood that their 'husband' will contract HIV from them or from other women he 'sampled' is also heightened if he does not already carry the virus. Hence, it is a very serious misconception that the traffi c of women in China as 'brides' will have little impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic there.",

Again, this kind of attitude illustrates the low status that many women (and children) continue to occupy in Chinese society and the patriarchal factors that heighten their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. In addition, it is widely predicted that the sale of women in China is set to continue to expand because from a purely economic standpoint, buying a traffi cked bride can be far cheaper than paying a dowry (Song, cited in Jaschok and Miers 1994 : 265) . Also, the skewed sex ratios that have resulted from the introduction of the One Child Policy and resultant resurgence of son preference have seen men far outnumber women in many areas of China (Edwards 2000 : 75) . It has been estimated that by 2029, there will be 30 million more males than females in the 20-49 year age bracket due to sex selective abortion and the neglect of girl children in China (Chan et al. 2002 : 429) . Due to the gender imbalance it is unlikely that these men will be able to fi nd a bride to marry legally and they will increasingly turn to bride traffi cking as the solution, making it a crime that is likely to soar over the next few decades, alongside prostitution.",

As a result, women who escape their situation are often returned to their 'husbands' by authorities. Villagers also assist in the traffi cking of women either by ignoring the problem, or by helping to buy women. In fact, it has been reported that one remote village collectively purchased women with the intention of soliciting them from their homes (Woodman and Ho, cited in Hughes et al. 1999 ) .

She stated that although many male migrant workers are married, they leave their wives behind and often engage in 'risky practices' in the cities, such as IDU, procuring sex workers, and infi delity. Generally, the men return to their homes once a year, during which they engage in sexual activity with their spouse, usually without using condoms. The interviewee further stated that even if the woman may suspect her spouse of having engaged in 'risky practices' while away, many women are unable to insist that their spouse use a condom (Interviewee C 2003, pers. comm., 22 August) . In addition, for many rural women, labour migration can heighten their vulnerability to HIV transmission because it removes them from the economic support and protection nets that exist in their home villages, making them easy targets to be lured or forced into prostitution. In fact, a large number of China's sex workers are migrant women (Thompson 2003 ) and they sometimes display higher risk behaviour than non-migrant sex workers, in part due to low education levels and poor HIV/AIDS awareness, which increases their likelihood of contracting HIV (Hong et al. 2009 ) . Many migrant women have also become the victims of sexual harassment and sexual violence, which also increases their vulnerability to HIV transmission.",

If workers from the government organizations identifi ed sex workers, she stated that they were required to report them because of the illegality of prostitution. After being reported, the identifi ed sex worker would then face detention in a rehabilitation centre. While there are debates in China as to whether or not prostitution should be decriminalized or legalized so as to allow INGOs, NGOs and government organizations to legally provide STI prevention knowledge and services to sex workers, the rehabilitation system does currently offer an opportunity to reach this vulnerable group with HIV/AIDS prevention information. However, Interviewee D (2003, pers. comm., 27 August) stated that this was not occurring, even though the organization she worked for had been trying to launch programs that linked 'HIV/AIDS prevention education into the rehabilitation programs of these centres'. Furthermore, without adequate help to overcome their economic insecurity, upon release from these centres many women actually returned to prostitution.

This obvious gender bias is in part fuelled by the extant view in China that those selling sex always come before those buying sex. This view is problematic in that one could argue that it is demand that drives provision; however at a very basic level it punishes the sex worker as the guilty party in the commercial sex exchange and not the solicitor. It also means that many of the men who solicit prostitutes are left out of the targeted commercial sex HIV prevention strategies although they are clearly a 'high-risk' group (Chen 2008 ) . If they are married or have other sexual encounters outside of the commercial sexual exchange, they are also a possible 'bridge' population who have the potential to transmit HIV into the general population. Chen ( 2008 ) argues that the failure of the Chinese government to adequately respond to this contradiction refl ects that there is an urgent need in China for recognition of the important role men play in safer sexual practice, a responsibility that is continually being thrust onto women. In fact, recent campaigns by the ACWF reportedly 'exposed' 27.25 million women across China to HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness knowledge. However, there was no discussion of if/how men were also given this important knowledge or if they were made aware of how their actions can impact on the HIV vulnerability of their spouses (SCAWCO and UNAIDS 2007 ) . Considering the unequal gender-based power relations discussed above, it is unlikely that these types of measures will have much success as men and women both need to be involved in such advocacy programs. To neglect the involvement and importance of men serves to increase women's vulnerability while at the same time proportioning responsibility to women for their own HIV safety, something that is simply unachievable for many women.",

Approximately 60% of rural women are now showing symptoms of having untreated RTIs or STIs (Interviewee C 2003, pers. comm., 22 August), both of which increase their susceptibility to HIV through sexual transmission ( Jolly and Ying 2003 : 2) . The fi gures on STIs clearly indicate that behaviours conducive to the transmission of HIV/AIDS, such as unprotected intercourse, are becoming more widespread. However, rural healthcare facilities continue to be inadequate, and therefore information on HIV/AIDS and prevention of the virus is not reaching rural men and women (Interviewee C 2003, pers. comm., 22 August) . In addition, many rural women are not targeted for information dissemination due to the offi cial belief that these women fall into the 'low-risk' category due to their marital status and individual behaviour. In light of the discussion above, this overly simplistic classifi cation of who is or is not 'at risk' is substantially heightening women's vulnerability to HIV. Considering the changing face of China's HIV/AIDS epidemic in the current era, the failure of the government to have a comprehensive gendered response to the burgeoning AIDS epidemic in the PRC may result in the government ineffectively responding to HIV/AIDS. Chen ( 2008 ) warns that this could lead to an increase in stigma and discrimination against women as their HIV+ rates increase and may further exacerbate women's insecurity.",

However, after the dismantling of government sponsorship, the rural healthcare system was left in ruins, with only expensive private doctors available to meet the health care needs of the rural population. Another problem with the provision of health care is that the government does not regulate STI facilities. In fact, some STI clinics are now being rented out to private practitioners. While this can benefi t PLWHA, because it reduces the possibility of their HIV+ status being leaked, 9 it also causes prices to rise and patient care tends to decline (Interviewee C 2003, pers. comm., 22 August) . Therefore, the privatization of essential services such as the health industry has seen medical services fall out of the economic reach of many poorer families or individuals. This compounds Chinese women's vulnerability to HIV because it limits the ability of both men and women to manage their sexual and reproductive health.",

The 'One Care' component refers to care and economic assistance for people affl icted with or affected by HIV/AIDS (Cao et al. 2006 : 520) . However, by the government's own admission, the implementation of this policy has been uneven (National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control 2006 : ii), so while it is certainly a step in the right direction, it is not fully operational as it will require a great deal of cooperation between all levels of government and assistance by civil society before it can really meet its objectives. It should be acknowledged that China has been injecting more funds into HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment strategies since 2003. The 2009 update by UNAIDS and the World Health Organization reported that there had been a threefold increase in funding by China in the period between 2003 and 2006 demonstrating stronger commitment from the government (UNAIDS and WHO 2009 ) .",

They stated that efforts like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) mass media education campaigns would be a major step in changing people's beliefs about HIV/ AIDS and increasing knowledge and public awareness of the virus and how it is transmitted. After the cessation of SARS, the Chinese government did shift its focus to HIV/AIDS, and education campaigns on HIV/AIDS have been undertaken. Therefore, unlike previous efforts, top leaders in government have demonstrated they are serious in their response to HIV/AIDS. While this signals a positive change, unfortunately the gender issues that contribute to HIV/AIDS vulnerability do not appear to be an integral component of these campaigns, so their overall effectiveness is doubtful. In addition, gender inclusive campaigns would also need to be supported with active steps at both the government and grassroots level to reverse the continuing unequal social, political and economic structures that disempowered Chinese women, which have been shown to heighten their vulnerability to HIV/ AIDS.

Yet, while the central government may fear that the emergence of civil society could contribute to a breakdown in the Chinese Communist Party's authority in China, civil society participation and the free fl ow of information are not only good governance when responding to HIV/ AIDS epidemics, but international experience has proven them to be essential elements in a state's response to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, until the central government is willing to allow greater autonomy among the various NGOs and INGOs operating in China, it is unlikely that the Chinese response to HIV/AIDS will make any real inroads in the prevention of HIV transmission -and even less so in terms of gender-specifi c issues such as the human insecurities that increase women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.",

By overlooking the many social, cultural, economic and political factors that contribute to HIV/AIDS vulnerability and transmission of the virus, particularly those faced by women, China has a long way to go before Chinese women are protected from HIV transmission.
