Since then PEDV has caused substantial economic losses, predominantly in Asia, but in May 2013 a new PEDV variant has emerged and rapidly spread in the US (Stevenson et al., 2013) . From this time to early June 2014, PEDV outbreaks had been reported in 33 states of the United States causing approximately 7 million piglet deaths, and resulting in severe economic losses to the swine industry (US Department of Agriculture, 2015). In early 2014, a novel variant of PEDV (OH 851) was identified in Ohio, containing insertions and deletions in the S gene (S INDEL), causing mild clinical signs and lower mortality rates in suckling piglets (Wang et al., 2014) . More recently, an epidemic of severe watery diarrhea in Southern Germany with typical clinical signs of PEDV was reported and found to be caused by a novel PEDV, closely related to the US strain OH851, causing concern regarding on the possible circulation of a novel more virulent strain (Hanke et al., 2015) . In the present work we describe an outbreak of severe watery diarrhea in swine caused by PEDV in Portugal, early 2015, and the spread northwards in the country.",

Four of these samples (two were from a farm in the South and two were from a farm in the Center of Portugal) were tested by conventional RT-PCR and amplified products (440 bp) were subjected to sequencing in order to obtain information about their genetic relatedness with PEDV reference strains (Fig. 1) . Comparative analyses of these amplicons showed that all amplified sequences were identical (100%), showing that a single strain was responsible for this outbreak. Analysis also showed that the amplified sequences share a very high (99.0%) identity with the new PEDV variant OH851 (GenBank accession no. KJ399978) of the United States that affects sows (Wang et al., 2014) .

Comparative analyses of a 440 bp region of the spike protein gene showed that the isolates were identical to the ones reported in 2015 in Germany. The findings of an identical PEDV strain in the South of Europe, substantially distant from Germany where the novel strains have been reported seem to indicate that a single strain (different from the American) is circulating in Europe. As with Germany, in Portugal there is no active surveillance scheme for PEDV, hence we cannot state with confidence that this strain has not been circulating in Portugal for a longer time. Also, the origin of this PEDV variant still needs to be elucidated and further studies in the remaining European countries may contribute to the knowledge. The re-emergence of PEDV in Europe with altered virulence seems to be a relevant issue in swine health and may justify active surveillance by the official entities.",
