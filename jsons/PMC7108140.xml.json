Fisher exact and \u03c72 tests were used to determine the difference of categorical data, and Kruskal-Wallis test was used for numeric data. Factors associated with detection of influenza airborne particles were analyzed by logistic regression. Numbers of occupants on site, ventilation rate, and indoor CO2 concentration were categorized as high (upper 33%), intermediate (middle 33%), and low (lower 33%) based on the numeric data distribution (Supplementary Figure 1). Factors that were significantly associated (P < .05) with detection of influenza airborne particles were further investigated in multivariable logistic regression models. The final models were determined using backward model selection based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) (StepAIC function in R-package MASS) [32]. Factors known to be associated with airborne particle formation though failing to meet P < .05 were further investigated in competing models, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were examined.",

The numbers of occupants on site, indoor CO2 concentration, and the derived ventilation rate varied significantly across different sampling locations (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < .001). More occupants were recorded at canteens (50\u2013450) than at UHS (2\u201330) (Figure 1D). Higher ventilation was recorded at canteens (4.4\u201390.9 L/second/person) than at shuttle buses (1.1\u20136.4 L/second/person) (Figure 1E), with the highest CO2 concentrations recorded in shuttle buses (1234\u20134837 ppm) and the lowest at UHS (559\u2013948 ppm) (Figure 1F).
