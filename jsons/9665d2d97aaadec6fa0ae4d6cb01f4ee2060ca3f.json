We confirmed that TCI-1 was effective in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and with each of the three CAR constructs. The onset of CAR-T blockade was immediate after exposure to TCI-1 and was caused by interference with early phosphorylation events in the CAR signaling cascade as demonstrated by Western blot, and interference with the induction of transcription factors, as demonstrated with an NFAT-inducible reporter gene. Intriguingly, blockade of CAR-T function was effective for several days if exposure to TCI-1 was sustained, and instantaneously and fully reversible after removal of the compound. Short-and long-term exposure to TCI-1 did not reduce CAR-T viability, and did not hinder the subsequent ability of CAR-T to exert their functions. We considered that in patients with CRS, CAR-T are in an activated state, and performed comprehensive testing to show that TCI-1 was able to arrest CAR-T that are in the process of executing their effector functions. In addition, we employed a xenograft model in immunodeficient mice (NSG/Raji) to determine whether TCI-1 was capable of controlling the function of CD19 CAR-T cells in vivo.

It was 64% in patients transplanted from NK alloreactive donors vs 34% in patients transplanted from non-NK alloreactive donors (P = 0.09) (Fig. 1, Panel C) .",

As TAA like NY-eso, WT1, RHAMM, Proteinase 3 and PRAME are monomorphic self-antigens that are also expressed at low levels in normal, non-malignant cells, T cells recognizing these TAA peptides with high avidity in self-HLA are anticipated to be eliminated from the T cell repertoire by negative thymic selection. In malignant cells, the genes encoding TAA can be aberrantly upregulated resulting in an increased antigen density on the cell surface.

One patient cleared the virus after this second infusion, whereas the other patient developed CMV encephalitis and died 50 days after the second infusion. In some patients a clear appearance and/or increase in the numbers of circulating CMV-pp65-specific Tcells was observed after infusion of the CMV-pp65-specific T-cell product, whereas in other patients no, or only a subtle increase in the numbers of circulating CMV-pp65-specific Tcells was seen.",

Chronic leukaemia and other myeloproliferative disorders O043 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with CML-CP in the era of third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a study by the CMWP of the EBMT Background: Following the introduction of TKI in the early 2000's the use of alloHSCT for CML has dramatically decreased. Imatinib was the first TKI introduced and is mostly used as 1 st treatment. In case of insufficient response, resistance or intolerance, CML patients can be treated with a 2 nd or 3 rd generation TKI. Nevertheless there is still a role for alloHSCT for CML patients. We analysed the impact of the use of 1, 2 or 3 TKI prior to alloHSCT on transplant outcomes in patients who received alloHSCT for CML in CP between 2006 and 2016.",

All patients received TKI therapy prior to HCT. We analyzed transplant outcomes for two cohorts of patients: a) those who received post-HCT maintenance TKI and b) those who did not receive post-HCT maintenance TKI. Maintenance therapy was determined based on data recorded from posttransplant disease specific forms, which included the choice of TKI but not the date of initiation or the duration of maintenance therapy. Relapse was defined by report of molecular, cytogenetic, and/or hematologic disease post-HCT. Multivariate regression analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the association between maintenance TKI therapy with chronic GVHD, relapse, TRM, DFS and OS, with adjustment for patient-related, disease-related, and transplant-related values. In an attempt to correct for selection bias, this study was conducted as a landmark analysis that excluded patients that died, relapsed, had cGVHD or were censored prior to day 100 post-HCT.",

Notably those receiving myeloablative protocols do well. However on multivariate analysis this advantage is mitigated by other factors and outcomes are more affected by performance status, age and disease status having transformed to AML. Background: Haploidentical transplantation (Haplo-SCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) results in low rates of both GVHD and non-relapse mortality (NRM), especially using a non-myeloablative conditioning (NMAC) regimen (Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine (Flu) and 2 Gy TBI, Luznik BBMT 2008). In the setting of HLA-identical transplantation, we previously reported that more intensive regimen including busulfan (Bu) had better anti-tumor effect than NMAC (Blaise, Cancer 2013). Thus, to improve disease control after Haplo-SCT, we have progressively replaced NMAC by a thiotepa (TT), Flu and Bu conditioning platform (TBF), especially for myeloid malignancies. Here, we report the outcome of TBF conditioning Haplo-SCT in AML or MDS patients. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of GVHD and immunosuppressive therapy after Haplo-SCT, and the early toxicities that may be related to TBF with PT-Cy.",

Full-text articles were then reviewed for eligibility. Study characteristics (eg, sample size, treatment dose, patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, HSCT/non-HSCT) of selected publications were summarized and publications were categorized by those that reported all VOD/SOS patients, those with VOD/SOS with MOD and those with VOD/SOS without MOD. Patientlevel data were evaluated when available. When necessary, additional data tables for these studies were also requested. A random effects model was used for pooling data for efficacy.

Background: Approximately 80% of matched unrelated donors for allogeneic stem cell transplantations are mismatched from patients for HLA-DP. Although frequently not taken into account in donor selection, mismatched HLA-DP can induce potent immune responses, consisting of graft-versus-leukemia reactivity and graft-versus-host disease. Some HLA-DP mismatches are more permissive than others because they belong to the same T-cell epitope (TCE) group. HLA-DPB1 alleles are categorized into TCE groups based on in vitro experiments using recognition patterns of anti-HLA-DP directed T-cells and peptide sequences of the binding groove. TCE groups 1 and 2 are clearly defined, but TCE group 3 contains the HLA-DPB1 alleles not belonging to group 1 or 2, and may represent a relatively heterogeneous group. To investigate whether peptides binding in HLA-DP can be of influence in the categorization into TCE groups, we analyzed the peptidome of 11 HLA-DP molecules.",

Using Gibbs clustering, motifs within the peptide pools could be identified. Specific amino acids were found on positions P1, P6 and P9, which interact with amino acids in hypervariable regions (HvR) of the HLA-DP binding groove. All 3 alleles from TCE group 1 had a similar motif KAL at P1, P6 and P9, reflecting their structural similarity in the relevant HvR. This motif was shared also by DPB1*14:01 from TCE2, while the motif from HLA-DPB1*03:01 was different (RAS). TCE3 alleles could be classified into two groups: those with a totally different FFV motif at P1, P6 and P9 (DPB1*02:01, 04:01, 04:02 with high structural similarity), and those with a motif more similar to TCE1 in P1, but different in P6 and P9 (KXX), i.e. DPB1*01:01, 05:01 and 13:01. Interestingly, the latter three share the amino acid sequence DEAV in one HvR with TCE1 and TCE2 alleles, suggesting that they might constitute a fourth, functionally distinct TCE group.

The incidence of late acute and chronic GVHD in our study was lower than that reported from prospective observation in north American cohort (Arora et al. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant, 2016). This discrepancy outlines different characteristics between the cohorts, probably reflecting both graft sources and genetic backgrounds. Background: Graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS), defined as the absence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment, relapse, or death, has been proposed as a novel composite endpoint for clinical trials evaluating GVHD prophylaxis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GRFS is currently regarded as one of important measures to evaluate transplant success, since it represents not only disease-free survival but also survival without major morbidity related to GVHD. However, GRFS treats GVHD as a fixed failure event, even though GVHD may be resolved by treatment and thus GRFS apparently overestimates the impact of GVHD on the outcome of allo-HCT. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new composite endpoint that accurately reflects the long-term success of allo-HCT in terms of life expectancy, disease remission, and quality of life (QOL).",

GVHD response at day 28 postrandomisation was similar in both arms. We postulate that steroid pre-treatment may have inhibited MSC activity. Our results highlight the difficulties involved in conducting interventional studies in GVHD. Recruitment was slow, perhaps due to a reduction in incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD at our centre (43% in 2012-14 vs 30% in 2015-2016). The chosen primary endpoint of 12-month overall survival, while robust, is subject to influence by non-study variables, including conditioning regimen selection. Our results do not support the use of MSC in addition to corticosteroids at diagnosis of acute GVHD. Early clinical studies reporting responses to MSC in steroid-refractory GVHD warrant further investigation. Background: Intestinal Acute graft-versus-host disease (i-aGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The clinical diagnosis of i-aGVHD is usually based on symptoms and CT findings but a definite diagnosis is made by endoscopic biopsies.

Amino acid variability at peptidebinding positions in the HLA-DP molecule has been shown to determine functionally distinct T-cell epitope (TCE) groups. Clinical risk associations have been found between DPB1 mismatches within the same TCE group (\"permissive\") or across different TCE groups (\"non-permissive\"), eliciting limited and strong donor T-cell alloreactivity, respectively. The non-classical HLA-DM, a class II peptide editor that can be antagonized by HLA-DO in certain subsets of healthy and malignant immune cells, catalyzes dissociation of low-affinity peptides and binding of high-affinity peptides to HLA class II molecules during endosomal processing.

Given that BATF is predominately expressed by lymphoid lineages, we hypothesized that BATF-expressing T cells might contribute to this enhanced expression prompting us to study the functional relevance of donor T cell-intrinsic BATF for GVHD manifestation. Our data demonstrate that BATF is absolutely indispensable for the manifestation of intestinal GVHD. We found initial expansion and homing of allo-reactive T cells into the colonic lamina propria (cLP) compartment to be largely unaffected in the absence of BATF. However, upon GVHD onset the magnitude of the colonic donor T cell population became increasingly BATF-dependent. Interestingly, in addition to Th17 differentiation, we found that T cell-intrinsic GM-CSF-and IL-6-expression of colonic donor T cells were highly dependent on BATF while Th1 differentiation was unaffected.",

The procedure today results in frequent morbidity/mortality mainly due to graft versus host disease and toxicity from irradiation/chemotherapy conditioning currently employed to enable donor HSC engraftment. Although many efforts have been undertaken to reduce toxic conditioning, most patients still suffer from side effects including organ damage, infertility, secondary malignancies, and cytopenias.

In the past, outcome of PID children undergoing haplo-HSCT appeared to be inferior to that of children receiving the allograft from an HLAmatched either related or unrelated donor. We conducted a prospective trial on alpha/beta T-cell and B-cell depleted haplo-HSCT, followed by infusion of donor lymphocytes genetically transduced with the iC9 suicide gene (BPX-501 cells) in children with PIDs treated in 3 European centers.",

The 3 most frequent diagnoses were SCID (15 patients) WAS (9 patients) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH, 5 patients, see Table for details). All children received a conditioning regimen, which varied according to the original disease. To prevent graft rejection, all patients received anti-thymocyte globulins (ATLG Neovii\u00ae 4 mg/kg/day on days -4, -3, -2). Details on the numbers of cell infused are shown in the Table. Results: Thirty-nine patients exhibited sustained donor engraftment; children experiencing graft failure (3 with HLH and one affected by combined immunodeficiency, CID) engrafted after either a second haplo-HSCT or, in one case, following an unrelated cord blood transplant. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 16 and 10 days, respectively. Twelve patients developed grade I-III acute GvHD, the cumulative incidence of the disease being 28.8%. Among the 38 patients at risk, none developed chronic GvHD. Three patients received the agent (AP1903, Rimiducid) capable of activating iC9; two children obtained a complete response. Two patients (the child with CID who rejected the first allograft and one with WAS) died after transplantation due to pulmonary hemorrhage caused by aspergillus infection (already existing before HSCT) and undefined leukoencephalopathy, respectively. The 2-year probabilities of OS and DFS for the entire cohort of patients are 95%. Considering graft failure and death by any cause as events, the 2-year EFS is 88%. T cells progressively recovered over time; the mean number of CD3+ cells at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after HSCT was 377, 690, 1563, 3096 and 3300/\u03bcl, respectively.

This strategy may enable patient-tailored treatment and guide preemptive therapeutic choices based on the actual infectious risk, thus minimizing overtreatment and its associated toxicities. The complexity of NK cell response is a function of a series of activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors known as Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), which sense perturbations in HLA expression after viral transformation of the target cell. Here, we determined how KIR gene repertoire and associated NK cell transcripts and phenotypes influences NK cell against EBV targets and confers protection against PTLD. Methods: Next generation sequencing based KIR profiling was performed to obtain KIR gene repertoires of 356 HLAmatched donor-recipient pairs of first allo-HCT and 45 healthy individuals. NK cells negatively selected from PBMNCs of healthy individuals were stimulated with EBV-transformed target cells. Flow cytometry based enumeration of NK cells that were either degranulating (CD107a expression) or producing cytokine (IFN-\u03b3), as well as their simultaneous KIR-based phenotypic characterization was performed. Total RNA was extracted before and after co-stimulation of NK cells with EBV targets, on which the transcript analysis was performed using a custom NanoString-based codeset containing probes for 53 NK cell function related genes.",

Four patients underwent FMT as a decolonization strategy before HSCT. Median interval from FMT to HSCT was 28 (range 9-46) days. Six patients underwent FMT after HSCT. Median time from HSCT to FMT was 163 (range 98-344) days. All patients undergoing FMT after HSCT were still under immunosuppressive therapy, with one of them presenting active grade IV gut graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) when undergoing FMT. A frozen FMT product was used in eight out of ten patients. Enema administration was used in all but one patient. All but one patient had a neutrophil count >1x10 9 /L at time of FMT. Two patients experienced systemic infections due to MDRbacteria before FMT. Three patients needed a second FMT from the same donor, due to initial failure of the procedure. Reasons for failure were mainly technical, with one patient probably receiving an insufficient quantity of stools from an unrelated donor (< 50 g) and another who kept the FMT material for less than 2 hours. In the third patient a \"compassionate\" FMT for multiple infections and grade IV GVHD was performed but failed twice.",

Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can be controlled by immune competent heathy subjects but maintains latent through several mechanisms of immune suppression and escape. Reactivated infection with HCMV is associated with poor outcome in immune compromised hosts after stem cell transplantation (SCT). Adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells in a SCT-setting has proven efficacious, but the approach is problematic when seropositive donors are not available, such as in the case of cord blood (CB)-SCT. Hence, we designed T cells expressing HCMV-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) from HCMV seronegative donors to control viral lytic reactivation. The HCMV-glycoprotein B (gB) was used as target, because it is a highly conserved surface-bound protein abundantly expressed on cells hosting lytic replication. We further tested if a professional antigen presenting cell expressing gB would provide optimal homeostatic and antigenic stimuli to maintain gB-CAR T cells active.",

Transplantation, Berlin, Germany; 6 Chimerix, Durham, NC, United States; 7 Analytica-Laser, New York, NY, United States Background: Both pediatric and adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients are at high risk for adenovirus (AdV) infections, particularly during the period before immune reconstitution. AdV viremia has been strongly correlated with mortality in single-center studies (Lion 2014; Mynarek 2014). There is a critical need for robust data from multicenter studies evaluating the relationship between AdV viral burden and mortality. AdV viral load over time, a quantitative measure in plasma of cytolytic AdV infection in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver and/or kidney, is proposed as a surrogate marker of clinical outcomes in studies of investigational antiviral therapies.",

As a consequence, 300 patients (170 male, 130 female) were analyzed. On the basis of numerical abnormality and structural break point, abnormal karyotypes using G-banding stain were analyzed. The karyotype with 3 or more abnormalities was defined as complex one. We used selected chromosomal abnormalities, whose frequencies were more than 15, as variables for survival analysis. Survival analysis was performed with Cox model (OS) and competing risk regression model (NRM and ATL-related death) and multivariate analysis were done with Backward stepwise method. Finally, we extracted significant abnormalities with Holm method and evaluate their correlations. Separately, survival analysis on complex karyotype was performed.",

Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints were engraftment, acute/chronic Graftversus-host-disease (a/cGvHD), hematologic remission and relapse. We identified 55 patients (14 from our NIS, 19 from our published cohort and 22 additional patients) transplanted 1987-2015. More than 10 allo-SCTs were performed in Germany (17), Netherlands (12) and France (11) . 29 patients were male. Dominant amyloid organ involvement was kidney, heart and soft-tissue. Median interval from first diagnosis to allo-SCT was 21 months. Allo-SCT was the second transplant in 30 patients (22 as first and only 3 patients as third transplant). Peripheral blood was the stem cell source in 42 patients, BM was used in 12 and CB in 1. Conditioning regimen was considered myeloablative in 12 and included TBI in 32 with a median total dose of 2 Gy [2, 12] , Fludarabine (29), Melphalan (11), Cyclophosphamide (9) and Busulfan (6) . HLA matching was syngeneic (7), matched relative (34), mismatched relative (2), matched unrelated (11) Conclusions: This is the largest cohort of AL patients treated with allo-SCT. Allo-SCT was feasible and effective in selected patients in the last 10 years. In opposite to our previous retrospective analysis, we observed a low mortality using mostly RIC. Our updated results revealed a rewarding long-term survival. Therefore, allo-SCT with an HLA-identical donor might be considered in heavily pretreated patients.",

We engineered primary human CD229 CAR T cells based on 2D3 and compared their in vitro expansion and expression of exhaustion marker PD-1 during production to CD19-specific CAR T cells. We found that CD229 CAR T cells expanded similarly to well established CD19 CAR T cells and showed no sustained upregulation of PD-1 indicating the absence of autotargeting and tonic signaling. In addition, T cell phenotypes mirrored those of CD19 CAR T cells during and after production, further substantiating the absence of selective autotargeting. As CD229 has previously been shown to be expressed on T cells, we performed in vitro cytotoxicity assays using normal T cells and found that, while untreated T cells are susceptible to CD229 CAR T cell killing, T cells previously activated with CD3/CD28 beads were protected explaining the lack of autotargeting during production. We also did not observe any killing of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells or natural killer cells by CD229 CAR T cells. Importantly, MM cell lines were efficiently and specifically killed by CD229 CAR T cells at very low effector target ratios. In mouse xenograft models, animals treated with 1x10 6 CD229 CAR T cells showed a significant delay in MM progression compared to animals treated with CAR T cells lacking a binding domain (StopX). In animals treated with 3x10 6 CAR T cells, we observed complete eradication of MM (Fig. 1) . Importantly, we did not observe the emergence of antigen loss variants during treatment with CD229 CAR T cells.",

In vivo efficacy and persistence is linked to the proportion of less-differentiated CART cells within the product.

Table] table 1] median 6,4*10 6 CD34+/kg, and 2.3*10 6 CD3+ T-cells/kg of the co-infused negative fraction (obtained following CD133+-selection). Over 85% of patients achieved successful CD4+ IR after NiCord and over-time CD4+, monocyte, NK and B-cell reconstitution was rapid and robust (Fig 1, 2) . When comparing the NiCord with 20 CBT (median age 15.4; 12.2-22.1 yrs) and 14 BMT (median age 14.3; 12.1-19.7 yrs), no difference in probability of CD4 +-IR was noted (p = 0.98: Fig 1) . Overall T-cell IR (CD3 +; p = 0.57, CD4+; p = 0.53, CD8+; p = 0.26) was similar, while IR of NK-cells (p < 0.001), B-cells (p = 0.017) and monocytes (p < 0.001), was faster after transplantation with NiCord, compared to unCBT and BMT cohorts (Fig 2A-C) .",

When compared to patients with myeloid malignancies, in patients with lymphoma a remarkable survival benefit was observed. Recently, we have shown that sequential TCR/PTCY haplo-HSCT is feasible and effective in relapsed and refractory (R/R) NHL (Zoellner AK et al, BMT 2015). To further clearify the role of haplo-HSCT strategy in aggressive lymphoma, we performed a matched-pair analysis comparing outcome of HLA-matched related donor (MRD) or unrelated donor (MURD) transplantation versus PTCYbased haploidentical donor (haplo-D) transplantation at our institution.",

The recent demonstration of clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibition in the post allogeneic hematopoietic transplant (allo-HSCT) setting, prompted us to investigate whether or not the expression of PD1/PDL1 axis and/or LAG3 in pretransplant tumor biopsies predicts outcome following allo-HSCT in lymphoma.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and follow-up data of lymphoma patients undergoing allo-HSCT at our Institution between 2003 and 2016.

For patients who do not have an HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor, cord blood transplantation (UCBT) and non T-cell depleted stem cell transplantation from haploidentical donors (HAPLO) are possible alternatives. Both strategies have shown encouraging results in recent years. Methods: We retrospectively compared outcomes of 409 adults with sAML (secondary to other haematological malignancies) receiving either UCBT (n = 163) or HAPLO (n = 246) in EBMT centers from 2007 to 2016.",

The donor was identical sibling in 9 cPNH, and 10 BMF/PNH cases; matched unrelated donor in 24 cPNH and BMF/PNH cases each. 10 patients received hematopoietic cells from mismatched unrelated donors. The source of stem cells was either peripheral blood (28 cPNH and BMF/PNH each), bone marrow (10 cPNH and BMF/PNH each) or a combination of both (1 BMF/PNH). Altogether 9 patients suffered from previous thrombotic episodes (5 in cPNH, 4 in BMF/ PNH). No patient was treated with C5-inhibitor prior to alloHCT. Clone size at transplantation amounted at median 80% and 10% for cPNH and BMF/PNH.Results: Engraftment was reported for 37 out of 38 cPNH, and for 37 out or 39 BMF/PNH patients. With the median survival of surviving patients of 4.5 years, the 5year overall survival (OS) reached 94.2% (95% CI, 78.8-98.5) for cPNH, and 76.1% (95% CI, 57.9-87.3) for BMF/ PNH. Patients with cPNH and history of thrombosis had tendency to inferior survival in comparison to patients without thrombosis i.e. 5-yrs OS reached 77.8% (95% CI, 16.6-96.5) vs 96.7% (95% CI, 78.6-99.5) -the difference was not significant (p>0,05). Type of conditioning, source of stem cells, donor type, history of thrombosis or hemolysis did not impact survival in univariate analysis. Acute graft versus host disease grade 2-4 was observed in 6 cPNH, and in 9 BMF/PNH patients, while chronic graft versus disease in 12 cPNH patients (including one severe), and 10 BMF/PNH patients (inc. 4 severe).Conclusions: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a potent method of treatment for patients with both classic and bone marrow failure associated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. It offers very high long-term survival with acceptable toxicity.Clinical Trial Registry: not applicable Conflict of interest: none Saint Antoine Hospital, Department of Haematology, Paris, France; 22 H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, AP-HP Assistance Publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, CRMR Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Maladies Auto-Immunes Syst\u00e9miques Rares d'Ile-de-France, Fili\u00e8re 'FAI2R', Paris Denis Diderot University, Department of Internal Medicine, Unit\u00e9 Clinique de M\u00e9decine Interne, Maladies Auto-Immunes et Pathologie Vasculaire, UF 04, Paris, FranceBackground: Following 3 adequate randomized trials using non-myeloablative (ASTIS, ASSIT) or TBImyeloablative regimen (SCOTT) plus regularly updated EBMT guidelines, autologous stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) became the best proven effective therapy (EBMT evidence level grade 1) for systemic sclerosis (SSc) with organ involvement within 5 years of disease onset, which otherwise carries dreadful outcome. Nonetheless, different patient selection criteria and treatment protocols are used in various centres and it is not clear which approach is the safest and most efficient.Methods: An EBMT-ADWP open, multi-center, prospective non-interventional study analysed routinely collected clinical and biological data for all consecutive AHSCT performed in SSc patients, diagnosed according to ACR-criteria and aged 18 to 65 years at transplant, from 2013 to 2015. Endpoints were: Response to treatment ( = increase in modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) \u226525% and/ or in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and/or Carbon Monoxide Lung diffusing capacity (DLCO) \u226510% without need of further immunosuppression), Relapse Incidence (RI), Progression free survival (PFS, survival with/without relapse or progression), Overall survival (OS) and Non Relapse Mortality (NRM). Univariate analyses using log-rank test for OS and PFS, Gray's test for RI and TRM were used to study possible impact of prognostic factors (age, gender, mRRS, lung, cardiac and kidney abnormalities). Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model. 2%) patients received G-CSF following AHSCT. Time to neutrophils > 0.5 x 10^9/L was 11.5d(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24), 9d (1-25) for platelets > 20 x 10^9/L. At 2 years, cumulative incidence (CI) of response was 85.4 % (95% CI: 75.3-91.5), RI 24.3 % (95% CI: 15.1-34.7), PFS 69.6 % (95% CI: 59-80.1) and OS 90.2 % (95% CI: 83.7-96.6). The 100d and 2yrs NRM was 6.2 % (95% CI: 2.3-12.9). Figure 1 shows mRSS improvement over 2 yrs. On multivariate analysis, no factors were significantly associated with response, RI or OS, only lung crepitation at baseline was significantly associated with PFS [HR = 0.43 (95% CI: 0.19-0.97) p = 0.042].Conclusions: This largest prospective study with 2 years follow-up after AHSCT in 82 SSc patients highlights improved practices over time with decreased TRM at 6.2% (versus 10% in ASTIS) and sustained skin and lung fibrosis regression after transplant.Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interestO031The use of Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in treatment na\u00efve patients with severe multiple sclerosis",

The limited number of matched donors, easy availability of haploidentical donors, and early encouraging results with lower non relapse mortality (NRM) have expanded haploidentical transplantation as a potentially curative treatment in a variety of hematologic malignancies. Data on the use of haploidentical transplant in MM are limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis to examine the outcome of patients with MM who underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation within EBMT/ CIBMTR centers. Results: A total of 96 pts underwent haploidentical transplant between 2008-2016. Median age 54.9 y/o (36.6-73.3), gender M/F 63/33, ISS stage I-II 43 (44.8%) and III 37 (38.5%), subtype IgG 41 (42.7%), IgA 15 (15.%), light chain 34 (35.4%), others 4 (4,2%) and missing 2(2.1%). Sixty six pts (68.8%) had prior autologous transplant and 30 pts (31.2%) had >1 prior autologous transplant. Disease status: CR/sCR/VGPR 36 (37.5%), PR 30 (31.2%), SD 13 (13.5%) and PD/relapse 17 (17.7%). Time from diagnosis >24 months (mo.) in 79 pts (82%), 18-24 mo. 8 (8.3%) and < 24 mo. in 9 pts (9.4%). Recipient/donor CMV status: both seronegative 13 (13.5%), recipient-/donor+ 6.2 (8.3%), recipient+/donor-8 (8.3%) and both seropositive 39 (40.6%), missing data in 30.

Patients were then under prophylaxis by valaciclovir, levofloxacin, fluconazole and aerosolized pentamidine and followed-up in day hospital at days 5, 7, 10, 12 and 14, in a specialized bone marrow transplant recipients day care unit, where transfusions were performed as needed.Results: During 17 years, 429 patients were treated with semi-ambulatory early-discharge ASCT at our institution, with ages comprised between 27 and 71 years (median 56,3). Patients with significant comorbidities, such as dialyze-requiring renal failure or mental retardation, or with social frailty, were excluded from this management strategy. The mean aplasia output occurred at day 10 Background: Despite a remarkable increase of effective treatment options, multiple myeloma (MM) still remains mostly incurable. Especially in subgroups with high-risk cytogenetics and higher ISS stage, the outcome is poor with an overall survival (OS) of 24 to 36 months. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) offers a potentially curative option but it is discussed controversially because of considerable treatment related mortality and the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The few available studies indicate that allo-SCT can individually be considered for younger patients with good performance status and highrisk disease in the initial course of therapy or in the first chemotherapy-sensitive relapse with the potential to achieve a better long-term survival, but should primarily be restricted to clinical trials. Moreover, the current development of effective immunotherapy approaches, including antibodies and CAR-T cells, have re-introduced a larger interest into allo-SCT Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 109 consecutive patients diagnosed with MM who received allo-SCT at the Freiburg University Medical Center between 2000 und 2015 with regard to treatment response, survival and adverse reactions.Results: The median age in our cohort was 56 years with equal numbers of men and women. 54% of these patients showed high-risk cytogenetics. 35% were treated in terms of individual salvage attempts in relapsed or refractory situations after extensive pre-treatment, 92% received prior auto-SCT. 37% were included in preemptive settings within different clinical trials of the German Myeloma Study Group (DSMM). 51% of allo-SCTs were conducted with a HLA-matched unrelated donor, 8% with a HLAmismatched unrelated and 41% with a related donor. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens were used. We observed a median OS of 40.3 months and a median progression free survival of 16.3 months with a median follow up of 71.5 months. The overall response rate was 72% with 43% achieving a complete remission, 8% a very good partial remission and 20% a partial remission. The nonrelapse mortality was low with 13%. Acute GvHD II-IV\u00b0o ccurred in 25%, extensive chronic GvHD in 21%.Conclusions: Allo-SCT has been conducted at our academic center in heavily pretreated young patients with relapsed/refractory or high-risk disease. We could observe a high response rate with a low treatment-related mortality. Thus, our data suggest that allo-SCT in the context of novel agents and immunotherapy approaches may enable longterm survival and even potential cure in a carefully selected subgroup of fit high-risk patients.",

Primary endpoint was OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed, adjusting for factors that affected survival, namely age, donor, graft source, recipient CMV status, disease, and performance status. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates for survival, stratified by HCT-CI scores, were performed.Results: 3,195 children \u226420 years of age were identified having immune deficiencies (23%), acquired aplastic anemia (21%), hemoglobinopathies (19%), marrow failure (12%), histiocytic disorders (12%), metabolic diseases (11%), and autoimmune diseases (< 1%). The most frequent comorbidities were infection (8%), mild hepatic disease (7.5%), and moderate pulmonary insufficiency (6%). Overall, patients with HCT-CI scores of 0 (69%), 1-2 (19%), and \u22653 (13%) had 2-year OS of 83%, 83%, and 74%, respectively (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, HCT-CI scores of \u22653 [hazard ratio (HR): 1.61, p < 0.0001] were associated with worse OS compared to scores of 0, while scores of 1-2 were not (HR:1.08, p = 0.459). In subgroup analyses per age groups ( Table 1) , scores of \u22653 predicted worse OS in children up to age 2 and >2-10 years old. Lack of association between scores \u22653 and survival in patients aged >10-20 years could be partially explained by the unique diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies in most of these patients, who as a group have an OS at 2years >85%.Conclusions: This is the largest study to date investigating the impact of comorbidities per the HCT-CI in children. Children up to age 10 years old, who had nonmalignant diseases and HCT-CI scores \u2265 3, experience increased risk of death after allogeneic transplantation. Currently, we are studying other measures of health impairments to further refine pediatric risk assessment, and to better understand risks of older children and those with hemoglobinopathies.",

We have retrospectively analyzed the transplant outcome of patients with ALD in Japan and tried to clarify the prognostic factors of transplant outcomes based on the TRUMP, database of Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Methods: From 1988 to 2015, 112 male patients have undergone SCT at 1-40years old (median 8) and interval from diagnosis to SCT was 0.7-295 months (median 3.7months). Stem cell source was bone marrow (BM, n = 62, 34 related and 28 unrelated) or cord blood (CB, n = 50, one related and 49 unrelated). Serological HLA disparity was 0/6 (n = 63), 1/6 (n = 36), and 2/6 (n = 10). Conditioning regimen included A: FLU+MEL+low dose TBI (n = 44), B; BU+CY \u00b1 others (n = 27), C: MEL+TLI/TAI \u00b1 ATG (n = 30), and D: others (n = 11). GVHD prophylaxis was done with MTX+TAC (n = 69), MTX+CSA (n = 30) and others (n = 13). Statistical analysis was done with EZR (Saitama, Japan) and rejection or any death was counted as event.Results: Sustained engraftment was obtained in 94patients (79.4%) and it was significantly higher in BMT than CBT (90.3% vs 66.0%, P < 0.001). Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was 18.6% and 20.2% respectively. Five-year overall survival (5-yr OS), event-free survival (EFS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 91.1%, 76.0% and 7.9%, with median follow-up of 4.3years, respectively. 5-yr OS according to the conditioning regimen was 100.0% in A, 92.4% in B, 86.0% in C, and 70.7% in D (P = 0.033). 5-yr EFS was 80.6% in A, 81.3% in B, 73.3% in C, and 53.0% in D (P = 0.430), respectively. According to stem cell source, 5-yr OS was 93.1% in BMT and 88.1% in CBT (P = 0.430) and 5-yr EFS was 85.1% in BMT and 65.1% in CBT. TRM was 15.5% before 2005 and it was significantly decreased to 1.9% after 2006 (P = 0.045). 5-yr OS was significantly improved after 2006 than before 2005 (86.0% vs 96.1%, P = 0.035) and it was remarkable after 2006 in CBT (69.8% vs 96.6%, P = 0.005). By multivariate analysis, TBI was identified as the only significant favorable prognostic factor for EFS (HR = 0.420, P = 0.042). Fourteen patients died of ARDS (n = 3), TMA (n = 1), chicken pox (n = 1), interstitial pneumonia (n = 6), and progression of disease (n = 3).Conclusions: Our results showed that conditioning regimen which includes TBI, even at low dose could provide better transplant outcome and the result of CBT was significantly improved after 2006. Since immediate transplant is essential for symptomatic ALD patients, CBT is suitable for urgent SCT when family donor is not available.Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become a standard component of therapy forBackground: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome caused by mutations in ribosomal genes. Patients usually present with transfusion-dependent anemia in early infancy. A significant proportion of patients has mild neutropenia and may develop additional thrombocytopenia in the course of the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for the hematological manifestations.Here we report the outcome following HSCT of patients registered in the German and the French DBA registry.Methods: Sixty-eight patients (45 males/23 females) were transplanted between 1987 and 2017. Median age at HSCT was 5.2 (range 0.9-16.8) years. In addition to transfusion dependency for red blood cells indications for HSCT were neutropenia or thrombocytopenia(8), steroid intolerance (6) (2), no mutation (6) or no data (13) . The donor for 1 st /2 nd HSCT was matched siblings (21/17), haplo-identical donors (7/11), other family members (4/6), or unrelated donors (47/45). Stem cell source for 1 st /2 nd HSCT was bone marrow (52/36), peripheral blood (14/35), or cord blood (13/8). The conditioning regimen for 1 st HSCT was busulfan/ cyclophosphamide/ melphalan in 59 patients and other regimen in 20 patients; that for 2 nd HSCT was a radiationbased regimen in 34 patients, treosulfan (Treo)/ fludarabine (Flu)/ thiotepa (TT) in 11 patients, and others in 34 patients.Results: The median follow-up after 2 nd HSCT was 5.4 years for survivors. The evert-free-survival (EFS) at 5 years was 34% with no difference according to indication of 2 nd HSCT (relapse/GF after 1 st HSCT: 35%/31%). Engraftment was achieved in 68 patients (86%) after 2 nd HSCT. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-hostdisease (GvHD), chronic GvHD, relapse at 5 years and transplant related mortality (TRM) at 5 years was 46%, 32%, 37% and 29%, respectively. Patients transplanted following a radiation-based regimen showed a better engraftment rate (only 1 GF), but no superior EFS to other regimens. In contrast, 9 of 10 patients given the Treo/Flu/ TT regimen (6 relapse and 4 GF after 1 st HSCT) are alive in remission. The analysis for the subgroup with relapse after 1 st HSCT showed that the longer interval between 1 st HSCT and relapse gives rise to a better EFS (\u2265180 days: 50%, < 180 days: 23%, p = 0.04). The EFS of patients with a PTPN11 mutation who relapsed after 1 st HSCT was 32% with the high incidence of 2 nd relapse (47%).Conclusions: 2 nd HSCT is a feasible treatment for relapse or GF after 1 st HSCT. TRM and relapse contributes equally to treatment failure and further efforts are necessary to improve the outcome. The survival of the group with patients given the Treo/Flu/TT regimen was excellent, although the number of patients is small and further studies are needed to confirm this promising result.Conflict of interest: nothing to disclose Methods: Fifty-eight children (n = 42 ATG-G, n = 16 ATG-F), who received T-cell replete BM or PBSC from unrelated donors for the treatment of ALL or AML in Leiden (n = 38) or Copenhagen (n = 20) were included. ATG-G was given at a total dose of 6-10 mg/kg; ATG-F at a total dose of 45-60 mg/kg. Serum samples (pre-conditioning, day 0; +1; +2; +3; +4 and +6 weeks and +2 and +3 months after graft infusion) were analyzed by Background: Disease status at the time of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the most important predictor of survival. We set out to characterize the evolution of outcomes in transplantation with different donor types across levels of disease-associated risk.Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients treated for hematologic malignancies who underwent first allogeneic HSCT between 2001 and 2015 in EBMT centers. Missing values were accounted for by multiple imputations. A three-level disease-risk scheme (low, intermediate, and high) was defined by introducing combinations of diagnosis and disease status into a Cox multivariate model for overall survival (OS). Additional covariates included in the model were reflective of patient, disease, transplant, and center related features.A variable combining donor type and HSCT year (2001-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015) was created. Using a Cox mutlivariable model, adjusted for key transplant covariates, the association of the joint donor type/transplant-year variable with OS, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and relapse, was studied seperately within each disease risk category. Competing risk analysis was used to calculate cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse.Results: A total of 103,049 patients were analyzed (Table) . A broad spectrum of hematological malignancies were included.There was an improvement in overall survival across all donor types. Conclusions: Survival following of allogeneic HSCT continues to improve. The change is driven by a reduction in NRM, most notably in Haplo transplant. Our findings indicate that donor type interacts with disease risk; relapse risk with unrelated and Haplo donors was lower than that of MSD, primarily in low risk disease.Conflict of interest: nothing to disclose Background: Advanced myeloid malignancies are associated with extremely poor outcome following allogeneic HSCT and this is often linked to the extent of residual disease pre-transplant. Methods: We carried out PTCy based Haploidentical PBSC transplantation in 74 patients with advanced myeloid malignancies. The first 30 patients did not receive any early post-transplant adoptive immunotherapy (non-EAI group) and the subsequent 44 patients received early adoptive immunotherapy (EAI group) in the form of prophylactic DLI on days +21, 25 and 60 (n = 21), CD56 enriched DLI on day +7 (n = 10) and CTLA4Ig-primed DLI on days +7, +21 and +35(n = 13). Majority received conditioning with Flu-Bu-Mel (n = 54), 10 each received Flu-Treo-2Gy TBI and Flu-Mel-Cyclo. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of PTCy 136 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4, followed by cyclosporine with or without mycophenolate.Results: The median age of the cohort was 28 years (2-65) with a median donor age of 34 years. All had relapsed/ refractory disease with 46 of them having adverse cytogenetics. There was no difference between the EAI and the non-EAI groups in terms of patient or donor age and gender, disease-risk, residual disease at transplant, HCT-CI, ABO or HLA mismatches, graft composition and donor NK alloreactivity. The median time to engraftment was 14 days. Acute GVHD was significantly higher in the non-EAI group (CI 36.7% vs 14.8% in EAI group, p = 0.01), whereas chronic GVHD was more in the EAI group (CI 40.1% vs 7.4% in EAI group, p = 0.01). The overall incidence of NRM was 13% and the disease progression was 45.6%. Disease progression in the EAI group was 24.8 % vs 74.7% in the non-EAI group (p = 0.0001). At a median follow-up of 34 months (9 months-7 years), the overall survival was 54%; 72.6 % in EAI group vs 26.7% in the non-EAI group (p = 0.0001, Fig) . Disease progression was favorably influenced by EAI (HR-0.23; p = 0.0001) and development of chronic GVHD (HR-0.24, p = 0.05). None developed severe GVHD and all surviving patients were free of GVHD and progression at 18 months.The incidences of acute GVHD were lowest in those receiving CD56 enriched DLI or CTLA4-primed DLI in the EAI group. On analysis of immune reconstitution, CD56 +16+ NK cell recovery at day 30 was significantly higher in those receiving CD56 enriched DLI or CTLA4-primed DLI, whereas the recovery of CD8 and CD4 cells were more rapid in the DLI group, as compared to the non-EAI group. Rapid recovery of Tregs at day 30 correlated with lack of acute GVHD but had no impact on chronic GVHD.Conclusions: PTCy based haploidentical PBSC transplantation provides an optimal platform for exploration of early adoptive immunotherapy in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies. Early post-transplant intervention with adoptive immunotherapy with either a T cell or NK cell directed approach results in marked reduction in disease progression with a low incidence of acute GVHD and NRM and improves overall survival in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies irrespective of pre-transplant disease status, as compared to those receiving similar conditioning without post-transplant intervention. Results: Characteristics of recipients of haploidentical and URD transplantations were similar except recipients of haploidentical transplantations had better HCT-CI, more likely to have favorable or intermediate risk cytogenetics, and to receive reduced intensity conditioning. The median time to haploidentical transplant for patients in CR1 and CR2 were 5 and 20 months, respectively. The corresponding times for URD transplant were 5 and 18 months. Marrow was the predominant graft for haploidentical and peripheral blood for URD transplantations. All recipients of haploidentical transplants received post-transplant cyclophosphamide with a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate, and recipients of URD transplants, calcineurin inhibitor \u00b1 mycophenolate or methotrexate. Haploidentical donors (25% siblings and 75% offspring) were mismatched at \u22652 HLA-loci with a median donor age, 37 years (range: 17-69). Adult unrelated donors were allele-level matched at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 with a median age 27 years (range 18-40). Unrelated adult donors aged > 40 years were excluded as the median age of unrelated donors is~30 years Methods: Adults aged 18-75 years with acute leukemia who received the first single unrelated CBT between 2000 and 2014 were eligible. Patients who received manipulated or multiple CBTs, or CBT combined with other cell sources were excluded. A total of 3764 and 1027 patients in the JSHCT/JDCHCT and Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT registries, respectively, were included. We analyzed the effect of patient, donor, and transplant characteristics on outcomes separately in each registry cohort.",

Median age of the Japanese and European cohorts was 51 (18-75) and 38 (18-74) years, correspondingly. The JSHCT/JDCHCT cohort consisted of more male patients (56% vs. 49%), had lower median weight (55 vs. 65Kg) and higher refined diseaserisk-index (rDRI) (56% vs. 33%) than the European cohort. Three or more HLA mismatches were more frequently observed in the JSHCT/JDCHCT than in Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT (23% vs. 4%) cohort. Median TNC count (\u00d710 7 /kg) was 2.58 and 3.51 in the JSHCT/JDCHCT and Eurocord/ ALWP-EBMT cohorts, respectively. Reduced-intensity conditioning was used in 35% and 25% of the Japanese and European cohorts, respectively. Anti-thymocyte globulin was used in only 2% of the JSHCT/JDCHCT cohort in contrast to 65% of the Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT. Calcineurin inhibitor plus mycophenolate mofetil was used as GVHD prophylaxis in 21% of the Japanese patients and in 46% of the Europeans. Calcineurin inhibitor plus methotrexate was used in 60% of the Japanese cohort but only in 5% of the European cohort. Overall survival (OS) at 3-year was 41% in JSHCT/JDCHCT and 33% in Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT.In the multivariate analysis, TNC dose and HLA matching had no significant effect on OS, in either cohort, whereas transplant year, patient age, and rDRI had an impact on OS in both populations. The impact of center experience on OS was more prominent in the JSHCT/ JDCHCT than Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT cohort. HLA matching (\u22652 vs. 0-1) was significantly associated with lower risk of relapse and higher risk of non-relapse mortality in the Japanese population, but not in the European. Higher TNC dose (>3.5 vs. 2.5-3.5 \u00d7 10 7 /kg) was significantly associated with better neutrophil engraftment only in the JSHCT/JDCHCT, but had no significant impact on other outcomes in either cohort. As primary cause of death, infection and GVHD were more frequently observed in the Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT cohort, whereas graft failure, organ failure, and hemorrhage were more frequent in the Japanese cohort.Conclusions: Despite considerable differences in patient and transplant characteristics between the Japanese and European cohorts, we observed similar prognostic factors affecting CBT outcomes in adult patients with acute leukemia in both registries.Clinical Trial Registry: not applicable Background: Nicotinamide-expanded cord blood (NiCord) is a promising alternative source for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) when an HLA-identical donor is lacking. Results from a phase 1/2 trial, with NiCord as standalone HCT, showed rapid neutrophil engraftment (median 11days) and thrombocyte engraftment (median 34days). However, successful CD4+-reconstitution has shown to be crucial for disease and viral control and is associated with favorable survival chances (Admiraal et al. JACI2017). We therefore evaluated early immune reconstitution (IR) after NiCord transplantation. Methods: In the phase1/2 multicenter trial, patients (n = 36) with hematologic malignancies received a standalone NiCord-transplantation after myeloablative (MA) conditioning (without ATG). Immune monitoring was performed (with harmonized sampling, handling and analyses in a central lab) in a random subgroup. The primary endpoint was probability of achieving CD4+ Tcell IR (>50*10 6 /L within 100 days). Secondary endpoints were IR over time of CD4+, CD8+, na\u00efve and effector/ memory T-cell subsets, monocytes, natural killer (NK) and B-cells during the first 6 months after HCT. Data were compared with IR in cohorts of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients at the UMC Utrecht receiving either unmanipulated cord blood transplantation (unCBT) or Trepleted unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for hematological malignancy after MA conditioning without ATG. Linear-mixed effects modelling in LOESSregression curves and two-sided log-rank test for univariate comparisons in cumulative incidence plots were used.Results: 15 NiCord recipients (median age 41.5; 13.4-61.7 yrs) were included. NiCord cell dose consisted of Background: BMT CTN 0201 data indicate that high numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in donor grafts resulted in increased survival and reduced graftversus-host disease (GvHD) in recipients of bone marrow (BM), but not granulocyte-colony stimulating factor peripheral blood grafts. Our data demonstrated that donor BM pDC modulate post-transplant outcomes through an IL-12 pathway with a T cell dependent IFNy feedback loop resulting in upregulation of IDO in pDC with no loss of graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect, but a reduction in GvHD. The studies described here examined the effect of FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) treated BM (F-BM) and pDC on transplant outcomes in a murine transplant model.Methods: Mice were treated with 300ug/kg of Flt3L on days -1 and -4. Cells counts of pDC and HSC in murine F-BM grafts were analyzed by flow cytometry. Murine H2b to H2k transplants were performed to compare survival and GVHD of BM versus F-BM donor graft recipients. A lymphoblastic T cell leukemia cell line, LBRM was used to assess GvT and survival in a murine tumor model. Gene expression of human BM and Ftl3L mobilized peripheral blood (F-PB) samples was assessed by Illumina chip. Differential expression analysis was performed using Limma R package.Results: Flt3L increased pDC content 3-fold and HSC content 1.5-fold in BM grafts. Transplantation of Flt3L treated BM with untreated T cells increased survival to 75% from 45% in recipients of untreated BM with T cells ( Figure  1A ). Flt3L treated BM grafts with T cells increased survival in a tumor model to 60% as compared to survival of mice transplanted with untreated BM grafts, which had a survival of 30%. Finally, human gene expression data show that BM pDC upregulate innate immunity pathways including tolllike receptor pathways more than F-PB pDC ( Figure 1B) .Conclusions: Flt3L increases pDC number in a BM graft. The use of F-BM grafts with or without T cells show a beneficial effect of Flt3L treatment on survival and GvHD due to limited GvHD without deletion of GvT activity of donor T cells. Furthermore, F-BM grafts increase survival in a murine tumor model. The difference in gene expression that results when comparing BM and F-PB samples show that BM pDC activate the innate immune system more than F-PB pDC and this may be the reason why there are differences in survival and GvHD. Ultimately, the use of Flt3L treatment for BM donors may prove to be an effective method to increase survival and GvT while reducing GvHD in recipients post transplant.(A) Murine transplant recipients received 5 million T cell depleted BM of F-BM cells with or without 4 million untreated T cells as indicated in the legend.
