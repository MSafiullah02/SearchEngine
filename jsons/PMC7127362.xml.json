These data were submitted to the PICNet management office for analysis by a consultant statistician. All data were entered in EpiData and analyzed in EpiInfo v.3.3. Examples of the data collected include: number of professional OH staff and employees served by the department, number of HCW immunizations, fit tests, and outbreak investigations completed in 2005, as well as descriptive data about the number and type of orientation and educational sessions conducted. The roles and responsibilities of the OH professional specific to occupational infections were divided into four categories: risk assessment, risk control, education, and evaluation.23 Data were also collected about contract workers and medical staff working in the organization.",

It is increasingly well documented that policy decisions in this area of infectious disease transmission, and the content of specific training programs, are best developed collaboratively,26 and because of their overlapping responsibilities, OH professionals must interact regularly and effectively with ICPs.27 For example, communication about employee safety within health care organizations, and especially between OH and IC, is important in creating safe workplaces,19 and clearly defining roles is essential.28 Coordination of OH services with other departments",
