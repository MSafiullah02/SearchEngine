Clasmatodendrosis, abnormal morphological changes in astrocytes, occurring presumably due to the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has recently been suggested to be a pathological feature of IAE on autopsy.24 Clasmatodendrosis was found in the cerebral white matter, thalamus, corpus callosum, cerebellum, thalamus and hippocampus of children with IAE and may correlate MRI changes commonly seen.24 Previous authors have associated abnormalities on MRI brain with poorer outcome.7 In our cohort MRI brain abnormalities were diverse and common, particularly diffusion restriction in the subcortical white matter. Diffusion restriction correlated with a poor outcome, apart from in the child who had PRES, and was associated with an elevated CSF neopterin in most cases. Further studies of IAE are required to evaluate whether significant elevations of CSF neopterin, particularly in combination with diffusion restriction and other MRI changes, could predict short and long-term outcome.",

While there was a significant rate of ICU admission among the group of children with status epilepticus (45%) this was not as high as children with IAE (82%) and, most often, non-IAE children did not experience a significant change in their mRS. This supports previous observations that survivors of IAE during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and in more recent non-pandemic influenza seasons in Australia, experienced significant ongoing disability.29, 30 We have previously shown in a large retrospective encephalitis cohort study that ICU admission, MRI diffusion restriction and status epilepticus and were risk factors for a long-term abnormal outcome.31 These risk factors were common (82%, 73%, 45%) in children with IAE from our cohort. The medium and long-term outcome in our cohort should be assessed including formal neuropsychological testing. Further research is required to understand and modulate the CNS inflammatory cascade present in IAE in order to modulate long term neurodisability.",

Children older than six months were eligible to be vaccinated and the vaccine was provided free to children with neurological disease.34 In our cohort just one child had a documented influenza vaccination, although a third of children were eligible for free immunisation and the remainder could have received an immunisation at the cost of around $20\u201350 AUD. We emphasise that the severe syndromes and adverse outcomes observed here should be considered preventable. Following high rates of influenza related morbidity in 2017(including these cases), New South Wales and other Australian states have introduced universal funded seasonal influenza immunisation to all children aged 6 months to 5 years.35\n",

The collection of clinical data was retrospective, and some electronic data were incomplete. Seasonal influenza immunisation status was not always clearly recorded, although we reviewed the Australian immunisation register to verify vaccination status where possible. Influenza sub-typing from NPA samples and CSF influenza PCR testing was not routinely performed. In the SE group, CSF studies, including CSF neopterin were performed infrequently and MRI brain infrequently requested. Due to this we were unable to use this group as a direct control for the finding of elevated CSF neopterin the IAE group. Serial CSF neopterin to assess treatment and clinical progress were not performed.",

CSF neopterin may be a useful diagnostic marker for IAE while its role as a prognostic marker requires further evaluation. MRI diffusion restriction was associated with a poor outcome in IAE. Short-term outcomes of children with neurological complications of influenza, especially within the IAE group, were alarming, with nearly two-thirds of children having a poor outcome despite receipt of ICU support, anticonvulsants, first-line immunotherapy and, in some, anti-viral treatment. Given the severity of influenza associated neurological complications, we recommend a \u201ctreat and test\u201d approach to the use of oseltamivir in children presenting with acute encephalopathy/encephalitis during the influenza season. Finally, seasonal influenza vaccination should be universally provided to children and those at risk of severe influenza, with better education and awareness to increase uptake in the paediatric population.",
