The balance between these two globulin fractions, together with the degree of lymphopenia, seem to influence the development of lesions (Paltrinieri et al., 2001).",

The detection of protein markers would be very useful in the diagnosis of FIPV infection as has already been demonstrated for AGP (Duthie et al., 1997). Moreover, changes in APPs in FCoV-exposed cats that do not develop the disease, might also be used as a marker for resistance to FIP.",

Compared to controls, cats with FIP shared the typical electrophoretic changes (Sparkes et al., 1991), and increased APP levels. In particular, a 10-fold increase of SAA was detectable, thus confirming its role as an APP in cats (Kajikawa et al., 1999). Although no cats with diseases other than FIP were included in this study, the high SAA concentration detected in sick cats suggests that this protein might also be a marker of FIP, as has been reported for Hp and AGP (Duthie et al., 1997; Stoddart et al., 1988). It is interesting to note that the APPs were particularly high at T\n0 in cat No. 51, suggesting that an inflammatory reaction was already occurring before the appearance of the symptoms (Kajikawa et al., 1999). Furthermore, cats with FIP had high IgG levels, most likely due to antibody production, but low IgM concentrations probably reflecting the fact that most of the cats were at an advanced stage of disease: in fact, \u03b2-globulins, where IgM migrate, increase only in cases of FIP with recent lesions (Paltrinieri et al., 2001). Unfortunately it was not possible to repeat the sampling in the two cats with FIP which were not euthanasized after the diagnosis. The behaviour of \u03b2-globulins and of APPs was different in the two cats probably depending on the different clinical forms or on the different times of sampling: in experimentally induced FIP, Hp decreases during the first 20 days post-infection, then increases (Stoddart et al., 1988).",

            "text": "IgG and IgM levels were quantitatively lower than the corresponding electrophoretic band (\u03b3- and \u03b2-globulins, respectively), in particular in cats with FIP. Non-Ig proteins with \u03b3-motility have been already reported (Paltrinieri et al., 1998). Although APPs with \u03b2-motility (e.g., transferrin or CRP) might account for the increase of \u03b2-globulins recorded in FCoV-exposed cats, one could speculate that the electrophoretic motility of some APPs might change during FIP, as occurs in humans, maybe due to changes in their glycosylation pattern (Mackiewicz and Mackiewicz, 1995; Ducret et al., 1996). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that AGP concentration was often higher than the total amount of \u03b11-globulins, where AGP should migrate. Moreover the decrease of \u03b12-globulins, observed in both the cats with FIP during the course of the disease, is not due to a quantitatively similar decrease of APPs. SAA concentration was too low (\u03bcg/mL) to influence the total \u03b12-globulin concentration, but changes of Hp levels should induce changes in the corresponding electrophoretic band. In contrast, the decrease of \u03b12-globulins in cats with FIP was higher than that of Hp, probably due to the decrease of some other \u201cnegative APP\u201d (Kaneko, 1997) or to changes of electrophoretic motility of APPs. The behaviour of \u03b12-globulins needs to be further investigated because it might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. This fraction decreased during FIP, but slightly increased in FCoV-exposed cats.",
