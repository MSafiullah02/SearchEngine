The target receptor for attachment to cell and subsequent internalization is through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE 2). After entry into the cell the virus RNA is released in the cytoplasm subsequently translated and replicated, after formation of envelope protein and incorporation of RNA into it the virus is released in the circulation[16].",

There is evidence from the animal experiments in mice that coronavirus enters the brain through a retrograde transfer via the olfactory epithelium or through the cribriform bone and reaches the brain in seven days\u2019 time. Secondly, during the viremia phase of illness, disruption of blood brain barrier causes the virus to enter the brain directly. Another postulated mechanism is the invasion of peripheral nerve terminals by CoV which then gains entry to the CNS through the synapse connected route. SinceCOVID-19 has similarities with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, therefore it can be presumed that it also follows the same pathways for CNS invasion as discussed above. The detailed discussion of host and virus interaction is beyond the scope of this article, and has been published elsewhere. 15,16\n",

They demonstrated that the smell and taste dysfunction was higher in the COVID-19 positive cases as compared to the negative cases. (smell loss:68% Vs. 16 %and taste loss: 71% Vs. 17%). Most of the patients in this study were ambulatory, did not need hospitalization and none required mechanical ventilation. They theorized that probably in ambulatory COVID-19 patients virus spreads via the nasal route as compared to the seriously ill patients in which the spread is most likely pulmonary. Bagheri et al reported results of a large Iranian cohort of 10069 patients by employing an online questionnaire-based survey[29]. Participants were cases with problems in decreased sense of smell recently (within the last 04 weeks of onset of COVID-19 outbreak in Iran).Anosmia and hyposmia was reported by 48.23% of the respondents while 83.38% also had a decreased taste sensation. The onset of anosmia was sudden in76.24%. Other clinical features reported by the participants were flu or cold symptoms before anosmia (75.5%), headaches (48.6%), nasal stiffness (43.7%) and fever (37.3%). In contrast the study by Mao et al. in their cohort of 214 Chinese patients reported impairment of taste in 12 (5.6%) and impairment of smell in 11 (5.1%) patients.

The other possible mechanism proposed was the infection-mediated immune response that causing elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum resulting in skeletal muscle damage.
