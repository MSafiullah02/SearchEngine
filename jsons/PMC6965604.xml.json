Dysplasia of microvessels, airways, and alveoli have been observed in lungs of such premature infants1. The \u201cnew\u201d form of BPD, deemed a developmental disorder, differs pathologically and clinically from the \u201cold\u201d form2. Before the period of antenatal steroid and intratracheal surfactant, the \u201cold\u201d BPD occurred in preterm infants (usually late preterm) who suffered from surfactant deficiency. These infants required high-ratio oxygen and ventilatory support, which trigger a heterogenous lung injury and remodeling. The sequels of lung damage marks with regions of atelectasis and hyperinflation, hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, lung fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular hypertensive changes3. After the period of prenatal steroid and postnatal surfactant intervention, the mortality of BPD significantly decreased, and shifted the demographics of BPD to more extreme preterm infants. \u201cNew\u201d BPD then occurred and being characterized by arrested alveolar-capillary development, namely fewer and larger alveoli develop, reducing the overall surface available for gas exchange4. The airways are relatively less affected, and inflammation is usually less prominent than in the old form of BPD1.",

This study along with other studies of either previous \u201cold\u201d and present \u201cnew\u201d BPD population, have revealed that such survivors experience persistent impairment in lung function6,7,11. Our study had shown some initial derangements in lung function (e.g., low respiratory system compliance and increased airway resistance) progressively recovered by 2 years of age. However, significant airflow limitation\u2014measured as tidal and raised-volume forced expiration and low tidal volume\u2014remained unchanged in children with severe BPD. Furthermore, our multivariate GEE model indicated that the number of days on positive-pressure ventilation was significantly inverse associated with z-scores of the majority of lung-function parameters in the later life. Performance of raised-volume flow-volume curve was also positively related to z-score of body length of preterm infants. Interestingly, current definition of BPD severity of preterm infants can\u2019t well predict the outcome of their lung function in later life.",

Poor alveolarization originates from the incomplete deposition of the parenchymal elastin fiber18, which in turn leads to decreased parenchymal elasticity, increased tendency of airway closure, and increased peripheral airway resistance. This further results in lower compliance and higher resistance of the respiratory system in early age7,19. These insufficiencies gradually recover by 2 years of age (as observed in this study among children with mild to moderate BPD), indicating that alveolarization steadily occurs during growth. However, no improvement in respiratory mechanics was seen among children with severe BPD. Similar result was also noted among patients with moderate to severe BPD in Thunqvist\u2019s report19. From the opinion of Barker\u2019s hypothesis20, the deficit of lung function in young age would result in early onset of respiratory insufficiency in adulthood. Thus, long-term assessments are needed in these children to investigate the elasticity of peripheral lung parenchyma, such as those focusing on forced oscillation technique21.",

To mimic spirometric measurement, assessments of forced flows and volumes in infancy are usually achieved through raised-volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression. In this study, airflow limitation was evident during early life, and the obstructed patterns were further exacerbated by 24 months of age; this phenomenon of airflow limitation was prominent and persistent in children with severe BPD. These findings indicate that the observed impairment in spirometric evolution is the manifestation of an early and persistent airway remodeling process occurred from infancy through childhood, and even adolescence.",

Although alveolarization continues throughout childhood, the outcomes are influenced by prenatal and early postnatal characteristics. Therefore, the lung function trajectories of adults appear to be partially determined very early in life. Both preterm birth and tobacco exposure have previously been associated with persistently low lung function performance during childhood and adolescence31. In a recent cohort study, preterm children with or without BPD exhibited a persistent decline in lung function after 4 years of age32. However, the determinants of lung function evolution among preterm infants had not previously been investigated. Our study clarified lung function evolution in such preterm infants. Impaired body length growth impedes lung function performance during growth. Sanchez-Solis et al. recently also shown that the gain of body length is associated with increase in lung function (exam of raised-volume forced expiration)33. This may related to the fact that body length is the dominant determinant of lung function in infants and preschool children14,15,34. Furthermore, our study found that postnatal respiratory morbidity (ventilator days) is significantly related to the performance of lung function (especially in exams of forced expiratory flow) in their later life up to preschool age. These results are consistent with the theory of continuous airway remodeling during infancy.",

First, because this was a cohort study and not a case\u2013control study, only a few patients had undergone all examinations at all time points. Therefore, obtaining well-defined trajectories of lung function evolution in individual preterm infants was difficult. Second, the airflow limitation may be affected by airway abnormalities, such as tracheobronchomalcia and congenital airway anomalies. Although chest computed tomography or bronchoscopy were not routinely performed in the study, infants with clinically evident airway anomalies were initially excluded from current study, thus minimizing the confounding effects. Third, several factors, such as preterm, severe postnatal respiratory infection, and maternal smoking, may be associated poor respiratory performance in later life. In this study, we had excluded infants with severe postnatal respiratory infection. In addition, although studies have demonstrated that maternal smoking unfavorably affects the respiratory function and health of infants35,36. This might have biased our results because prenatal tobacco exposure was not considered in our analysis. Nevertheless, only 3% of mothers of our study cohort reported smoking during pregnancy, and our previous study did not reveal any effect of maternal smoking on lung function13,14.",
