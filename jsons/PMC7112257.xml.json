These activities span three phases in time \u2013 product conceptualization, detail design and prototyping, and product manufacturing and launch \u2013 and can be classified by job function in terms of management, sales and marketing, research and design, manufacturing, and finance and economics. The activities can also be grouped into various unit tasks, which may involve several job functions and last over more than one development phase. For example, economic analysis includes activities in both phase II and phase III, and involves manufacturing as well as finance and economics. Of particular interest are those activities, italicized in Fig. 1, in product development that require the input of a chemical engineer. The execution of other activities within the same unit task may involve marketing and management. The key question is how to execute these unit tasks in a systematic manner to minimize the amount of time, effort and money for the development of chemical-based products. The rest of the issues in Fig. 1 such as product promotion and business management belong to other disciplines and will not be discussed in this article.",

Various issues related to product conceptualization of creams and pastes have been discussed by Wibowo and Ng (2001). For example, the quality factors such as sensorial, rheological, mechanical, and physicochemical have been classified. These quality factors are related to the material properties such as viscosity, dielectric constant, and so on, as well as to how the constituents are assembled to form the microstructure of the product, as characterized by structural attributes such as particle or droplet size distribution, phase volume fraction, and particle shape. An understanding of the relationships between product performance, and material properties and structural attributes enables the designer to select the proper ingredients and design the manufacturing process to obtain a product with the desired performance. However, the proposed product development procedure has not been demonstrated by developing an actual product. In this study, we will expand this previous effort by collaborating with an industrial partner.",

Subobjective D6 is further decomposed into D61\u2013D65 and so on. This exercise is often used by a product/process development team to show all the team members the tasks that need to be performed and the time by which they should be completed. By offering a hierarchical view of the development project in its totality, every member knows what other members are doing to achieve the overall goal. Also, it highlights the tasks that can be carried out concurrently, thereby reducing the overall development time.",

While previous experience provides a good starting point, a substantial amount of experimental trial and error is often involved in the development of a new product. We submit that the product be synthesized by defining its constituents and microstructure, rather than simply screening different alternatives generated in a combinatorial manner. In doing so, understanding of the physical phenomena that control the product performance forms the basis for rationalizing the development process. Various models are utilized to describe the relationships among product performance, material properties, and product attributes, so as to establish a link between the targeted performance and the required technical specifications of the product. Experiments are used to support the modeling effort, as complete scientific elucidation of the underlying physical phenomena behind the technology of many chemical products is still a long way off (Wintermantel, 1999). Thus, this integrative approach does not eliminate the need for previous experiences. Rather, it helps to organize them in a systematic way so that they can be better utilized in the development of a new product.",

They are used only in summer time during outdoor activities.\u2022Since most consumers do not like a greasy feeling, a lotion or a light cream is preferred.\u2022Since UVA (320\u2013400 nm) can pass through glass (Baumann, 2007), daily application of a sun-screening product with a moderate sun protection factor (SPF) value can be recommended for use indoors.\u2022There is a higher demand for sun-blocking and whitening products in summer time. Products resisting dryness are usually in higher demand in winter and dry weather.\u2022In the market, it is not difficult to find a day cream containing a moderate SPF value of 8\u201315 which can be used daily for all seasons.\u2022It is rather difficult to retrieve the lotion at the bottom of a bottle with a pump head.\u2022As recommended by an advertising agency, a bottle size of 50\u2013100 mL is appropriate for a day cream.\u2022Selling through chain retail stores can be arranged.\u2022A retail price in the range of HK$150\u2013350 per bottle should be considered.\u2022Unlike other products, our product with an herbal antioxidant offers a unique selling point.\u2022Strong scientific evidence that the herbal extract neutralizes UV-induced free radicals is needed.\u2022Hyaluronic acid can be considered as a moisturizing agent. However, enhancers might be needed to promote its penetration into the skin (Rieger, 1998).\u2022Natural products are preferred to artificial ingredients. Mosquito repellent can be added to the sunscreen to form a multifunctional product.\u2022After launching the first product, a series of related products derived from the first product can follow.\n",

These targets for the day cream were decided based on the collective experience of the development team. For the moisturizing function, a humectant or emollient can be added. Glycerol, propylene glycol and hyaluronic acid are commonly used for this purpose. For a product to spread readily, based on our own experience, a lotion or light cream with a viscosity between 6000 and 50,000 mPa s may give a more pleasant feel. The desired sensorial quality factors such as non-greasiness and softness are achievable by adjusting the emollient content, the ingredients and constituent droplet size. Furthermore, the use of appropriate emulsifiers with proper concentrations is critical to the stability of the product. The presence of zinc oxide particles in the formula can lead to whitening effect on the skin due to the reflection of visible light. This problem can be avoided by using zinc oxide nanoparticles.",

The HLB values of some common emollients and emulsifiers can be found from the catalogs provided by the suppliers and from literature. Some of these values are listed in Table 4, Table 5. Alternatively, the HLB values of different emulsifiers could be calculated based on their particular functional groups (Vaughan & Rice, 1990). However, the HLB system does not provide a definite answer to the selection problem, as other properties such as the compatibility of ingredients, the viscosity of the continuous phase and size of the emulsion droplets could affect the rate of creaming or phase splitting (Lissant, 1974), which dictates the stability of the emulsion system. Therefore, experienced formulators normally select an appropriate mixture of emulsifiers according to the types of emollients used. Experimentally, the required HLB value can be determined by mixing a pair of emulsifiers with high and low HLB values with the desired sample and see which HLB value yields a stable emulsion (Courtney, 1997, Uniqema Ltd., 2005).",

The ingredients were separated into three groups and mixed separately. The oil phase contained all the oil-soluble ingredients, the aqueous phase consisted of the water-soluble ingredients and the third group was the preservatives. The mixing procedure was developed based on the heuristics in Table 6. The aqueous phase was prepared first by dispersing the thickener, Carbopol\u00ae 940, in 80 g of water under mild heating and a stirring speed of 800 rpm using a magnetic stir plate. Most of the remaining components in the aqueous phase were mixed in a separate beaker and heated to 70 \u00b0C. These two solutions were combined at 70 \u00b0C after the thickener was completely dissolved. Triethanolamine, the pH modifier, was added last; the solution was thickened and the pH value reached 5\u20136. The oil phase was prepared by mixing cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, sunflower seed oil, and sweet almond oil under gentle heating. Zinc oxide suspension, Fructus Schisandrae extract, stearth-2 and oleth-20 were then added to the mixture sequentially. After raising the temperature of the oil phase to 70 \u00b0C, the oil phase was added to the aqueous phase slowly at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The mixture emulsified immediately and was left for natural cooling. The droplet size of the mixture was further reduced with the use of a hand-held mixer (Kenwood) for 3\u20135 min and then returned to moderate mixing, as excessive mixing might induce bubbles or weaken the thickeners. When the temperature of the emulsion reached 45 \u00b0C, the preservative phase was added with general mixing. The cream was then immersed in a sonication bath for 5 min to remove any trapped bubbles and was then allowed to cool to room temperature. According to the vendor of zinc oxide, the pH should not be kept below 7.5. Since the pH value for cosmetic products is usually limited to 5.5\u20138.0, we decided to maintain the pH value of this skin-care product close to 7.5 with the pH modifier.",

The enzymes that regenerate GSH from its oxidized form and decompose peroxides are glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), respectively. These two enzymes are active and inducible upon oxidative stress. Topical application of antioxidant containing cream can diminish such oxidizing damage arising from UV-irradiation. This animal test aimed to investigate the antioxidant ability of Fructus Schisandrae-containing cream product by measuring the levels of GSH and \u03b1-TOC and the activities of GR and GPX after UV-irradiation.

Two circular areas (37 mm in diameter) were marked on the shaved area. Each circle was divided into two semicircles as shown in Fig. 5\n. An amount of 200 mg of FS cream was applied to each of the two left semicircles, and the same amount of control cream was applied on the two right semicircles. The creams were applied once daily on the corresponding areas for 6 days. On the 7th day, the creams were applied 1 h before UV-irradiation, and the rat was anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of phenobarbital (120 mg/kg). A solar simulator (Oriel #96000, 150-W) with an output of 10.88 mW/m2 of UVA light (320\u2013400 nm) and UVB light (290\u2013320 nm) was used.

After the UV exposure, the rat was killed by cervical dislocation, and skin tissues (epidermis and dermis) of the four areas were isolated from the rat. Skin tissue samples were homogenized followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were subjected to biochemical analyses on the level of non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants.

The beneficial effect of FS cream on skin tissue became more apparent after UV-irradiation. The UV-induced depletions of skin antioxidants were significantly ameliorated by FS cream pretreatment. The enhancement of antioxidant status of skin tissue by FS cream was further evidenced by the measurement of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) production, an indirect index of free radical-induced oxidation of lipids.

The objective-time chart (Fig. 2) reflects this hierarchical thinking, which is in a way a simple extension of the hierarchical process design method proposed by Douglas (1988). Also well-recognized is the multiscale nature of product development in that the time and length scales of the relevant physicochemical phenomena, production activities, and logistics and transportation beyond the manufacturing plant differ by orders of magnitude (Charpentier, 2007; Grossmann & Westerberg, 2000; Lerou & Ng, 1996). Product development inevitably involves professionals in sales and marketing, law, project management, advertising, and financial analysis. This multidisciplinary nature is captured in Fig. 1 where the activities in product development are classified by phase and by job function, and several unit tasks are identified. In fact, on the technical side, there are also chemical-based products in science and engineering areas such as medicine, healthcare, foods, electronics and information technology that are not the primary domain of a typical chemical engineer.

            "text": "As the scope of the chemical industry expands from commodity chemical business to include the manufacture and sale of higher value-added products, many new opportunities emerge for chemical engineers to contribute in product development. An obvious question would be, what are the market segments that chemical engineering as a profession would like to engage in? A similar question was posed by the processing community in China (Ng, Li, & Kwauk, 2005). In addition, in each market segment, what are the tasks that a chemical engineer would like to and can perform? These questions have ramifications in what we consider to be a typical chemical engineering curriculum. The possible inclusion of business subjects in a chemical engineering education has been discussed by Landau (1997), Ng (2002), Ng and Wibowo (2003) and Wei (2008). The concept of unit operations has served process design well by providing the building blocks for process flowsheeting. Now, can the concept of unit tasks with their associated RAT2IO modules, properly defined, categorized and enriched with the necessary technical as well as non-technical details, serve as the building blocks for product development? Efforts to address some of these issues are underway.",
