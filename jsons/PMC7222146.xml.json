Some have described hypocoagulability in the intoxicated patient as evidenced by prolonged initiation of clot formation and decreased dynamics of clot formation resulting in a reduced risk of venous thrombotic events (VTE) in trauma [3, 4]. Conversely, others have established a link between alcohol intoxication and increased risk of thrombotic complications through elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis [2, 9]. This differential risk of adverse effects appears to be related to the amount of and timing within which ethanol is consumed [10, 11]. While there is a decrease in fibrinogen and platelets reported with excess alcohol consumption [12], there is also a reported increase in coagulation Factor VII, Factor VIII, and PAI-1 in the acutely intoxicated [9, 12, 13]. On the other hand, Factor VII has been shown to decrease in chronic alcohol use, likely from liver disease and synthetic dysfunction [14]. Furthermore, there is a greater increase in PAI-1 release compared to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in those who consume a larger amount of alcohol, thereby increasing the PAI-1:tPA ratio [12].",

Fibrinolysis shutdown has previously been identified as the most common fibrinolytic phenotype following injury and is also associated with increased mortality compared to physiologic fibrinolysis, often due to multiple organ failure [15\u201317] and has most commonly been measured by thrombelastography (TEG), a viscoelastic assay that provides a comprehensive assessment of clot formation and clot remodeling and degradation.

Massive transfusion was defined as greater than 10 units of red blood cells (RBC) or death within 6 h postinjury as we have found this definition to be related to adverse outcomes [18, 19]. Further, the inclusion of death within 6 h was to minimize survivor bias (i.e., non-survivors did not have the \u201copportunity\u201d to receive transfusions) [18, 19].

Two previous studies have each shown that the time to clot formation and rate of clot propagation are impaired in intoxicated patients. Our study does not show significant increases in the time to clot formation as measured by the activated clotting time (ACT) in intoxicated patients or the rate of clot propagation.

[23] showed that both males and females had increased PAI-1, the inhibitor of tPA-mediated fibrinolysis, after consumption of alcohol. In the male population, this was also associated with a small decrease in LY30 (clot breakdown). In a study evaluating the effects of alcohol consumption on cardiac risk, Djousse et al. [9] found that individuals who consumed larger amounts of alcohol, more than 14.9 g of alcohol per day (the equivalent of one drink), had increased circulating PAI-1, which they postulated increased the risk of thrombotic complications. Furthermore, evidence supports that in acute alcohol intoxication, there is an increase in both tPA and PAI-1 [11, 12]. However, the ratio of PAI-1:tPA is shifted to favor PAI-1 with the consumption of an increased amount of alcohol [12]. Furthermore elevated triglyceride levels resulting from heavy alcohol consumption may further stimulate PAI-1 gene expression, especially in people with a genetic makeup particularly sensitive to PAI-1 [24]. This increased PAI-1 gene expression could result in the inhibition of fibrinolysis and thus increase the risk for acute cardiac events [24]. Interestingly, the type of alcohol consumed appears to effect the ratio of PAI-1:tPA. Tousoulis et al. investigated the effects of types of alcohol on the fibrinolytic system and discovered that acute alcohol consumption increased the PAI-1:tPA ratio; however, this effect was not observed after the consumption of red wine [25]. These data support the notion that not only the amount of alcohol consumed but the type may adversely affect cardiovascular health.",

Furthermore, the odds of fibrinolysis shutdown were threefold higher if the BAL was > 150 mg/dL (> 1.5 g/L) and this BAL was also an independent predictor of fibrinolysis shutdown with an AUROC of 0.76, indicating BAL > 150 mg/dL (> 1.5 g/L) is a fair predictor of fibrinolysis shutdown. In vitro and in vivo studies have provided data that ethanol affects the fibrinolysis profile and studies in healthy human volunteers suggest that this decrease in fibrinolysis is secondary to circulating levels of PAI-1 [2, 26]. Our data are consistent with other previously published data that high levels of alcohol intoxication are associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity while low level of alcohol intoxication is not [9\u201312]. Furthermore, these data confirm that of Howard et al. who also recently evaluated alcohol effects on fibrinolysis using ROTEM [27]. They similarly illustrated that elevated levels of ETOH resulted in decreased fibrinolysis by ROTEM [27]. The confirmation of impaired fibrinolysis, on two similar but different viscoelastic platforms, in these two separate patient populations strengthens the notion that acute alcohol intoxication influences fibrinolytic phenotype more than previously thought and could be a risk factor for the development of fibrinolysis shutdown-related adverse outcomes.",

The CRASH-2 trial suggested that the early empiric use of tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces the rate of death in injured patients but identified increased mortality when this therapy was delivered > 3 h after injury [29]. Our group has argued that there should be a selective use of TXA in the injured patient as administration to those with a shutdown phenotype may be critical in the pathogenesis of postinjury organ failure and thrombotic complications [30]. At our institution, TXA is administered to patients that are in hemorrhagic shock with evidence of hyperfibrinolysis on TEG as we have found that the use of TXA in those not in hyperfibrinolysis may increase the risk of postinjury organ failure, thrombotic complications, and mortality [17, 30]. Experimental data have revealed that ethanol-exposed animals show enhanced PAI-1 expression and pulmonary fibrin deposition with coincident exaggeration of pulmonary edema and inflammatory injury [31]. High levels of alcohol and subsequent excess expression of PAI-1 may thus be a contributing factor toward the development of organ failure following injury and would likely be exacerbated with the concomitant use of antifibrinolytic therapy. Less than 10% of trauma activation patients received antifibrinolytic therapy overall, and less than 5% in patients that had a BAL measured making subgroup analysis of patients that received TXA unreliable.",

This is also seen in other studies evaluating alcohol\u2019s effects on fibrinolysis [27]. This could be due to an underpowered study to identify mortality differences. Furthermore, once the acute episode of intoxication resolves, the fibrinolytic phenotype could change from that of fibrinolysis shutdown to physiologic fibrinolysis or even hyperfibrinolysis. It may be that the patients who remain in a phenotype of fibrinolysis shutdown after the resolution of acute alcohol intoxication are the ones that have adverse effects in the form of late mortality or MOF.",

Low fibrinolytic activity has been associated with an increased mortality following injury, with a mortality of 17\u201322% compared to a physiologic level of fibrinolysis of 3\u201314% [15, 28]. The cause of death in the shutdown cohort was typically late death as previously discussed, and more commonly associated with multiorgan failure [15, 28]. It has been a hypothesis that multiple organ failure is caused by microthrombotic complications stemming from the decreased clot breakdown associated with fibrinolysis shutdown [15, 28]. There are no pharmacologic interventions currently in use to specifically target fibrinolysis shutdown. However, by identifying alcohol intoxication as a modulator of the fibrinolysis phenotype, this could help guide future interventions to help reduce the incidence of fibrinolysis shutdown and subsequent micro- and macrothormbotic complications in the critically injured patient. Data suggest that an increased amount of PAI-1 and shifting the tPA:PAI-1 ratio in favor of PAI-1 is a likely factor that contributes toward increased incidence of fibrinolysis shutdown in the intoxicated patient.",

These data reflect a single point in time of a dynamic process and does not take into account the temporal changes of the coagulation process and subsequent evolution of fibrinolysis phenotypes. Unfortunately, there were patients in our TAP protocol that could not be included in the study because no BAL was obtained. BAL was obtained at the discretion of the trauma team. This may have led to a selection bias that must be taken into consideration with the interpretation of these results. Furthermore, we did not have information on the amount or type of alcohol ingested, the time during which alcohol was consumed, and reliable data on chronic ingestion of alcohol, which may have diverse effects. There were very few patients within our analyzed cohort that had documentation of chronic alcoholism (n = 26, 13.6%). There was a statistically significant trend (M\u2013H Chi-sq, p = 0.019) of high a BAL with documentation of chronic alcoholism, which may be due to increased frequency of documentation among BAL-positive patients. The significant association between BAL levels and LY30 was detected again among patients without documentation of chronic alcoholism (p = 0.007). However, the small number of patients with documented alcoholism limits the analysis in this group and, therefore, for the purpose of this study, we did not separate acute vs chronic users for analysis. We also acknowledge that a high BAL leading to increased risk of VTE is based on theory at this time as our cohort was not large enough to appropriately study this question.",

The mechanism of alcohol-related shutdown remains to be elucidated however, data would suggest a shift in the PAI-1:tPA ratio favoring PAI-1 may be a major contributor. Postinjury fibrinolysis shutdown has been associated with increased risk of organ failure and thrombotic complications; thus, a high BAL may represent a risk factor for VTE and microthrombotic events. Furthermore, the use of anti-fibrinolytic agents in patients with high BAL may have adverse effects by precipitating a more profound resistance to fibrinolysis.",
