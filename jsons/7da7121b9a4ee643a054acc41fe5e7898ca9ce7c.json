There was no previous history of infectious disease, abdominal pain or diarrhea. Due to the positive history of discoid lupus and the unusual presentation, the patient was referred to a tertiary hospital. On admission the patient, although well oriented in place and time, was inattentive, with delayed speech. Neurological examination revealed decreased muscular strength (2/5 on upper and lower limbs in all the muscular groups bilaterally). Major deep tendon reflexes were absent. Other findings from physical examination included a maculopapular rash located on the face, neck and elbows and a non-deforming arthritis involving metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints bilaterally.

A 5-day course of intravenous (iv) administration of immune globulin (IG) at 0.4 g/kg//day (30 g) in parallel with iv administration of prednisolone (25 mg) once a day was initiated.

A rapid and irregular heart rate (128 per min) was also recorded. ECG data were consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia. High resolution CT of the lungs disclosed small pleural effusions ( Fig. 1) with diffuse subsegmental areas of ground-glass attenuation in all lung fields (Fig. 2) . Bronchial lavage fluid examination was negative for pneumocystis carinii antibodies. Similarly, urine cultures were sterile and negative for the presence of any pathological microorganism. The patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) using a bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) mode at 15 l/min. After exclusion of infection and pulmonary embolism, lupus pneumonitis was the most possible diagnosis. Urine analysis revealed abnormal urinary sediment with proteinuria (3?), hematuria (3?) and granular casts. Hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g/dl) was also present. A single dose of 500 mg cyclophosphamide was administrated i.v. However, the patient's respiratory status continued to deteriorate (P a O 2 = 49.3 mmHg; P a CO 2 = 36.8 mmHg; Oxygen saturation 86.9 %) requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure type 1.

More specifically, she presented 4 of the 11 criteria with nonerosive arthritis, thrombocytopenia with lymphopenia, proteinuria and discoid rash. This is an unusual case of late-onset SLE presenting with motor sensory axonal polyneuropathy at the beginning of the disease. Occurrence of SLE beyond the 5th decade of life is considered relatively rare [2] . The low frequency of SLE in the elderly combined with the atypical clinical features at onset can lead to significant delays in diagnosis [3] . Font et al. [4] reported an increased interval from the beginning of the disease to diagnosis in elderly compared to younger patients with SLE (5 vs. 3 years). It is also remarkable that aging influences disease evolution with regard to clinical features, course and prognosis [5] . Published data suggest that pulmonary manifestations and serositis tend to occur more often in the late onset SLE [2, 5] while arthritis, renal involvement and skin lesions are less frequent manifestations [2, 5] . Consistently with our case, peripheral nervous system symptomatology was recorded more often in the elderly SLE group [6] .",

Although peripheral nervous system manifestations in patients with SLE are considered relatively common [10] , acute axonal polyneuropathy followed by albumino-cytological dissociation in the CSF (increased CSF protein in the absence of increased WBCs) is extremely rare in the context of SLE [8] . Ubogu et al. [11] reported a case of a young female presenting with AMSAN associated with active SLE and positive anticardiolipin antibodies. This type of peripheral neuropathy represents an axonal variant of GBS with slow recovery and poor prognosis, caused probably by an immune mediated attack on axonal epitopes [11, 12] . This later results in axonal degeneration due to macrophage induced phagocytosis and finally to Wallerian-like degeneration of myelinated motor and sensory nerve roots [11, 12] . Association of the axonal [11] . Clinical progression of AMSAN ranges from 7 to 28 days [11] . It is usually presents with severe motor and sensory dysfunction [11] . Cranial nerves and the respiratory system are often involved [11] . With regards to CSF findings, normal white cell count with normal or moderately elevated protein is usually found [11] . Recovery depends on axonal regeneration, occurring at approximately 1 mm daily [11] .",

This is a rare case of seronegative, late-onset SLE, initially presented with discoid lupus lesions and subsequently AMSAN. The atypical clinical features combined with negative serological findings led to a 'troubled' diagnosis. This case report offers information on the last few weeks' course of an apparently local disease and its conversion to systemic, through the entire chain of health care delivery (from primary to tertiary).
