The recommended treatment for RSV bronchiolitis is respiratory support and hydration of the patients (Shaw et al., 2013). Palivizumab is used prophylactically exclusively for high-risk infants. Unfortunately, its use is limited to patients in developed countries due to its extremely high cost and logistics of injections (Graham and Anderson, 2013, Shaw et al., 2013, Hurwitz, 2011). Ribavirin is also utilized as a treatment against RSV infections in high-risk young children, but is not very efficient and induces severe adverse effects (Graham and Anderson, 2013, Rosenberg et al., 2005).",

Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) has been considered a potential model of RSV infection (Watkiss et al., 2013). PVM is closely related to RSV as both belong to the same viral family and subfamily and induce similar disorders in their natural hosts (Easton et al., 2004, Bem et al., 2011), which makes it a suitable model for the study of RSV-induced inflammation and its contribution to severe respiratory disease outcomes.",

The first component of this formulation is poly(I:C), which promotes Th1 immune responses by inducing high levels of IL-12 and type I IFNs (Zhao et al., 2012, Tewari et al., 2010). The second component is an innate defense regulator (IDR) peptide, which is a derivative of bovine bactenecin and possesses immunomodulatory properties (Nijnik et al., 2010, Wu and Hancock, 1999, Hilchie et al., 2013). Lastly, this adjuvant platform contains poly[di(sodiumcarboxylatoethylphenoxy)]-phosphazene (PCEP), a synthetic water-soluble polymer that acts as a delivery system and can modulate innate immune responses (Mutwiri et al., 2007, Awate et al., 2012). The combination of poly(I:C), IDR peptide and PCEP (P-I-P) generates an immunomodulator with potential as an alternative strategy to prevent infectious diseases.",

This indicates a mild reaction and chronicity with no indication of functional problems (Fig. 6\nC,D).

This is an acute severe reaction indicating pulmonary damage and functional problems (Fig. 6E\u2013G). It can be noted that a large portion of the infiltrating cells are polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), mostly in the form of neutrophil granulocytes (Fig. 6F,G).

Furthermore, P-I-P treatment mediated early DC influx into the lungs of these mice, with numbers significantly higher than the PBS-treated PVM-infected animals (Fig. 9B). In P-I-P-treated animals, neutrophil infiltration was characterized by an early transient recruitment into the lungs prior to PVM infection, and after PVM challenge these numbers tended to decrease and level off. In contrast, PBS-treated PVM-infected mice started with low neutrophil counts, and as the infection progressed, these values drastically increased over time (Fig. 9C). On day 5 p.i., PBS-treated PVM-infected mice had greatly elevated levels of neutrophils in the lungs, suggesting neutrophilia. Eosinophil numbers of PBS-treated PVM-infected mice went up on day 3 p.i., and continued to increase thereafter. However, P-I-P-treated animals displayed very little eosinophil recruitment, similar to that of the PBS/Medium group (Fig. 9D). Lastly, P-I-P treatment induced recruitment of NK cells into the lungs on day 0 p.i. By days 3 and 5 p.i., NK cell influx decreased, reaching numbers comparable to those in the PBS/Medium group. Interestingly, PBS-treated PVM-challenged mice had delayed NK cell recruitment, with highest numbers on day 5 p.i. (Fig. 9E).",

P-I-P significantly upregulated the expression of genes involved in host defense within the first 24 h p.t. Thereafter, these levels decreased as expected due to their relatively short half-lives. P-I-P prophylaxis at 24 h prior to PVM challenge prevented weight loss and clinical symptoms, reduced lung immunopathology, and conferred complete survival. Additionally, P-I-P was found to be a superior formulation compared to poly(I:C), IDR peptide or PCEP alone (data not shown). P-I-P did not cause any observable adverse effects as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs following treatment. Interestingly, P-I-P mediated a substantial reduction of neutrophil and eosinophil influx during PVM infection, and induced the early recruitment of NK cells and DCs into the lungs. Lastly, the protective effect of P-I-P was maintained if delivered as early as 3 days prior to lethal challenge. Survivor mice were deemed PVM-free on day 14 p.i. This suggests that P-I-P modulation of host immune responses can trigger complete clearance of the virus from the site of infection.",

With regards to PVM as well as RSV, an effective therapeutic approach should be both antiviral and immunomodulatory in nature (Rosenberg et al., 2005, Bonville et al., 2003). One group demonstrated this principle for PVM by injecting mice with ribavirin together with CCL3 blockade by either gene-deletion or antibody (Bonville et al., 2003). In order to achieve the desired outcomes, two daily doses of ribavirin and a single daily dose of anti-CCL3 antibody were required during a period of 12 days (Bonville et al., 2003). As mentioned previously, ribavirin is known to induce toxicity and severe side effects in pediatric patients, discouraging its use in these populations. A few advantages of P-I-P treatment include the fact that it indirectly induces moderate antiviral activity and can down-modulate the levels of chemokines and cytokines such as CCL3, CCL2, CXCL1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 during PVM infection.",

Similarly, prominent granulocyte accumulation in the lungs is a hallmark of PVM infection, which eventually progresses to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress (Bonville et al., 2009). In contrast, one group showed that mice depleted from neutrophils before the establishment of influenza A infection resulted in increased morbidity and mortality (Tumpey et al., 2005, Drescher and Bai, 2013). This evidence suggests that neutrophil infiltration, if properly controlled, can be beneficial by reducing disease (i.e. promoting viral clearance).

Treatment with P-I-P had a direct effect on NK cell infiltration. This formulation mediated the expression of NK cell chemo-attractants in the lung (i.e. CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10). Once within the tissue, these cells are likely to find an optimal environment that supports their activation and autocrine production of IFN-\u03b3 (Vivier et al., 2008). Consequently, IFN-\u03b3 can act directly on alveolar macrophages, leading to their activation and increased phagocytic activity (Schroder et al., 2004).

These individuals could be treated with the P-I-P formulation during outbreaks of RSV or possibly other respiratory infections such that partial immune protection can be provided. P-I-P acts primarily at level of the innate immune system of the host, which allows us to speculate on the possibility of a well-established P-I-P therapy to protect patients from multiple viral infections at once. It would be beneficial if one can protect the most vulnerable populations from major diseases like influenza, coronavirus, and RSV infections as most of these tend to be transmitted through the same route of exposure and during the same seasons. Studies confirming such pleiotropic effect are yet to be performed.",
