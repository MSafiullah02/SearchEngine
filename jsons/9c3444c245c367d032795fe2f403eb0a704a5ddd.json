Of all virtual visits post expansion, 56.2% and 17.6% urgent and non-urgent visits, respectively, were COVID-19-related. Telemedicine usage was highest by patients aged 20-44, particularly for urgent care.

In all, results reflect what may become a new norm of future health care, and in particular during periods of contagious disease outbreaks. With a mass mobilization of health care providers onto diverse telemedicine platforms, an aspiration of the industry for years has materialized in a matter of days. In the telemedicine urgent care setting, this diversion of clinical care from inperson care has been a critical bulwark slowing the volume in more acute settings. With virtual urgent care utilization double that of emergency room visits at the height of the pandemic, these data substantiate the critical role of telemedicine in expanding emergency room capacity during a pandemic.",
