In temperate climates RSV strikes in the fall, winter and early spring. By 2 years of age, virtually all children have experienced a primary infection. In recent years it is has become clear that re-infection can occur throughout life. While symptoms of RSV infection tend to be milder in older children and adults, these individuals may serve as a reservoir for transmission to more susceptible hosts. RSV has been recognized as a cause of severe disease after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (1) (2) (3) (4) . Likewise, it is recognized as a cause of respiratory disease after pediatric solid-organ transplantation and is being increasingly recognized in adult recipients (3, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Risk-factors for development of lower respiratory tract disease in BMT recipients with RSV. infection include lymphocytopenia and neutropenia (4) . As many as 60% of BMT recipients infected with RSV will develop lower respiratory tract disease. Once lower tract disease is present, mortality rates ranging from 30 to 80% have been reported (1, 4, 7, 10) . Risk factors for more severe disease after organ transplantation include infection in children under a year of age or with underlying lung disease (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .

Despite its FDA approval, convincing data describing the clinical efficacy of this agent are lacking and a consensus on the utility of this drug in the treatment of RSV disease does not currently exist. Published data on the treatment of RSV disease in solid organ transplant recipients is very limited. However experience from the treatment of BMT recipients may provide guidance for the treatment of RSV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. BMT recipients have a high mortality rate from RSV pneumonia even with the use of aerosolized ribavirin (1-3,7,10,11) prompting the clinical investigation of additional therapeutic options in this patient population. A noncontrolled study using a combination of ribavirin with IVIG with higher RSV titers (RSV-IVIG, Respigam) was performed which appeared to demonstrate a benefit when used early after symptoms developed in BMT recipients (15, 16) . The high mortality rate in this patient population would lead many to recommend early therapy (BII).
