Animal samples are received at the PHL for a number of reasons including: rabies testing, West Nile virus surveillance, as well as ensuring the safety of our food animals through feed testing. Water samples are also tested at the PHL for a variety of reasons, but most importantly the PHL monitors both well water and public water systems. Food, be it peanut butter or spinach, is tested on a daily basis to detect pathogenic bacteria. Our soil, building materials and even cups and plates are tested to protect citizens from high levels of toxic chemicals such as lead.

PHLs also spend a significant amount of time developing new test procedures for emerging new diseases; such as the detection of the newest influenza virus strain that may cause the next epidemic or even a pandemic, as we experienced in 2009.

These surge capacity partners will have to have identical, or at least similar, testing capabilities, hence they are mainly other PHLs. Because PHLs are critical to the health of a population, they also have continuity of care agreements to ensure that, in the event one PHL is affected by a natural disaster, the other partner will perform their duties. Hurricane Katrina put these agreements to the test, especially in the areas of newborn screening, where test requests were successfully transferred to partner PHLs, because babies don\u2019t wait to be born because of a disaster (Fig. 16.1).\n\n",

            "text": "Since the advent of computers, the laboratory, with its capacity to produce and manage important data, has been at the forefront of health informatics. What initially began as a database for local results, over time developed into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that provides capacity for improved workflow management, inventory tracking, and most importantly, patient management. Testing is often performed on stand-alone instruments. These results need to be incorporated into the LIMS, in order to be included in the final result sent to the submitter. In the beginning the LIMS was capturing only those results that needed to be printed to be sent back to the submitter. With the improvement of informatics knowledge in the PHLs more and more of the instruments are being interfaced, using industry developed standards, improving the quality of data and making the workflow more efficient. Informatics practice certainly has transformed several laboratory workflows as organizations migrate from paper-based to electronic system-based tracking. Being able to draw data from a database in an electronic format facilitates secondary use of this information for forecasting or event detection. This information can then be shared with partners in the Public Health Laboratory system (e.g., the public health department, a regional taskforce, preparedness coordinators, policy makers and federal agencies). The capability of the laboratory and its public health partners to share data in the same format, through an electronic data interchange (EDI), can greatly reduce communication delays between partners; resulting in faster, better outcomes for both patient and population based responses. All these functions are covered by informatics principles \u2013 from database design to queries as well as application of format and content standards. Table 16.1 illustrates examples of laboratory data at the center of public health events. Figure 16.2 depicts other situations in which the PHL needs to exchange data with a partner as part of normal PHL operations, used with permission from Zarcone et al. [1].\n\n",

These data standards include the Logical Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae) [9] for the tests they perform, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED\u00ae) [10] to identify organisms and ordinal results, and codes from Health Level Seven (HL7\u00ae) [11] for patient demographics like gender, race, and ethnicity. To exchange standardized data between PHLs and their partners, the order and format of the data to be exchanged needs to be defined. For individual point to point exchanges, simpler formats can be agreed upon; for example, comma-separated files (CSV) or excel spreadsheets can be exchanged, but in order to accommodate larger scale data exchange with multiple partners across multiple information systems standards such as HL7\u00ae messages (in version 2.x) or the XML-based clinical document architecture (CDA) formats should always be considered as part of the normal business process. In addition to utilizing these standards, transport mechanisms need to be defined and agreed upon by electronic data interchange (EDI) partners [12].",
