SL-CoVs found in bats are very similar to human isolates of SARS-CoV in that they have almost identical genomic organization and their gene products share a high level of amino acid sequence identity. We have shown previously that despite substantial antigenic cross-reactivity between bat sera from naturally infected animals and SARS-CoV, there was no cross-neutralization detected [1]. This discrepancy could be explained by the low level of sequence identity shared at the N-terminal domain of the S proteins between the two classes of viruses [1], [2]. The N-terminal region of coronavirus S proteins is known to be responsible for virus attachment to susceptible host cells, hence a major target of neutralizing antibodies [4].",
