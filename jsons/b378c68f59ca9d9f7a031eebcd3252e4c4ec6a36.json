            "text": "A recent global survey on transfusion requirements during venovenous ECMO, 2 with more than 400 respondents from 42 countries, showed institutional variations in transfusion practices. Of note, the transfusion trigger was significantly lower in high-volume ECMO centres (>24 cases per year) because they followed protocol-based transfusion practices and accepted lower haemoglobin levels, as compared with low-volume centres (<12 cases per year). 2 We believe that the majority of patients with COVID-19 who require ECMO could be treated with venovenous ECMO, and lower trigger thresholds (eg, 7 g/dL) would be tolerated if they are stable and not actively bleeding. 5 ECMO for such patients should be offered in experienced centres in line with WHO guidelines. Higher thresholds (eg, 8-10 g/dL) could be considered in patients with shock or evidence of impaired oxygen delivery despite ECMO. Efforts to maintain physiological haemoglobin levels during ECMO should not be done routinely; transfusion protocols with lower triggers coupled with blood preservation strategies (eg, autotransfusion of circuit blood during decannulation) 5 should reduce blood transfusion in patients with COVID-19 needing ECMO support.",
