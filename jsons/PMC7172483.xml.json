            "text": "Young piglets commonly develop diarrhea, clinical conditions known as neonatal diarrhea and post-weaning diarrhea. Pig neonatal diarrhea and post-weaning diarrhea are caused by pathogenic bacteria and viruses including diarrheal Escherichia coli, coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus \u2013 TGE, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus \u2013 PEDV) and rotaviruses, and continue to be the most important swine diseases (Fairbrother et al., 2005, Harvey et al., 2005, USDA, 2002). Diarrhea results in weight loss, slow growth and acute death, causing substantial economic losses to swine producers in the U.S. and other countries (Haesebrouck et al., 2004, Nagy and Fekete, 1999, Verdonck et al., 2002, Vu-Khac et al., 2007). While neonatal diarrhea can be effectively prevented by passive protection of maternal antibodies, through immunization of pregnant sows; there are no effective prevention strategies against post-weaning diarrhea in weaned pigs. Vaccination is considered the most practical and likely the most effective approach to prevent pig diarrhea. Unfortunately, there are no broadly effective vaccines available to protect young pigs against diarrhea particularly post-weaning diarrhea (Melkebeek et al., 2013, Ruan et al., 2011).",

Among the types of E. coli causing diarrhea in pigs (Nataro and Kaper, 1998), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC, viz. a group of E. coli strains producing enterotoxins) is by far the most common and important. These ETEC strains produce fimbrial adhesins and enterotoxins. Fimbrial adhesins mediate ETEC bacterial attachment to specific receptors at pig intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate colonization in the pig small intestine (Smith and Linggood, 1971), playing an essential role in initiating the disease. But it is the enterotoxins that disrupt fluid homeostasis in pig small intestinal epithelial cells to cause fluid and electrolyte hyper-secretion, leading to diarrhea (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). Fluid hyper-secretion results in the loss of some of the mucin layer and disruption of tight junctions of microvilli that further enhance bacterial colonization and worsen diarrheal disease (Berberov et al., 2004, Glenn et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2006). Therefore, fimbrial adhesins and enterotoxins are the key virulence determinants of ETEC diarrhea, and have been long targeted for prevention strategy development.",

            "text": "Fimbrial adhesins expressed by ETEC strains causing diarrhea in pigs are K88 (F4), F18, K99 (F5), 987P (F6), and F41 (F7) (Awad-Masalmeh et al., 1982, Casey et al., 1992, Frydendahl, 2002, Moon, 1990, Moseley et al., 1986, Nagy et al., 1977, Zhang et al., 2007). Toxins produced by porcine ETEC strains are porcine-type heat-labile toxin (pLT; which is homologous to but differs from the LT of ETEC causing human diarrhea\u2014hLT), heat-stable toxin type Ia (pSTa or porcine-type STa), heat-stable toxin type II (STb), Shiga toxin type 2e (Stx2e), and enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin type 1 (EAST1) (Frydendahl, 2002, Lee et al., 1983, Moon et al., 1980, Nakazawa et al., 1987, Osek, 1999, Zhang et al., 2007). Clinical observations and epidemiological studies revealed that a typical ETEC strain expresses one and occasionally two fimbrial adhesins and one, two or more toxins (Francis, 2002, Frydendahl, 2002, Zhang et al., 2007). Laboratory experimental studies demonstrated that an ETEC strain expressing one fimbrial adhesin and LT, STb, or STa enterotoxin causes diarrhea in young pigs (Berberov et al., 2004, Erume et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2008). Unlike LT and STa or STb, Stx2e is a member of the Shiga toxin family, and itself is thought to be primarily associated with Edema disease in young pigs (Bertschiner and Gyle, 1994). But as Stx2e is frequently found in ETEC strains expressing LT and/or ST toxins (Zajacova et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2007), it was also targeted for ETEC diarrhea prevention. In contrast, E. coli strains expressing fimbriae and EAST1 are found not associated with diarrhea in young pigs (Ruan et al., 2012, Zajacova et al., 2013). It is thought that a vaccine blocking attachment from all ETEC fimbrial adhesins to host receptors and/or eliminating enterotoxicity of ETEC toxins to host epithelial cells would be able to effectively protect against ETEC diarrhea in pigs and humans (Boedeker, 2005, Walker, 2005, Zhang and Sack, 2012).",

Different ETEC bacteria express immunologically heterogeneous fimbrial adhesins and distinctive enterotoxins. To overcome this challenge, innovative antigen preparation approaches are needed. The recently developed MEFA (multiepitope fusion antigen) strategy allowed us to include antigenic elements (epitopes) from multiple human ETEC virulence factors into a single recombinant protein to induce broadly protective antibody responses (Ruan et al., 2015, Ruan et al., 2014a). We also found recently that peptides (or toxoids) derived from mutated LT and STa toxins are safe antigens and LT-STa genetic fusions induce protective antibodies against both LT and ST toxins (Liu et al., 2011, Ruan et al., 2014b, Zhang et al., 2010). By applying the MEFA, toxoid, and genetic fusion approaches, we should be able to include antigenic elements from all porcine ETEC toxins into a single antigen and to develop a safe and broadly effective antitoxin vaccine.",

Data from the current study, however, showed that MEFA LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-STaP12F, which had the same STa toxoid but embedded inside the A1 peptide of the LTR192G, induced only mild IgG antibody response in the IP immunized mice. That suggested the STa toxoid may not be placed at an optimal position in this toxoid MEFA, negatively affecting its antigen presentation and thus anti-STa antigenicity. Knowing that additional copies of STa toxoid enhanced toxoid fusion anti-STa antigenicity (Zhang et al., 2013), we constructed toxoid MEFA \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-3xSTaP12F\u2019 to carry three copies of the STaP12F. Mice immunized with LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-3xSTaP12F developed similar levels of anti-LT, anti-STb and anti-Stx2e IgG antibody responses compared to the mice immunized with toxin MEFA \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-STaP12F\u2019 (data not shown), but a greater anti-STa IgG antibody titer (Fig. 3). Whether STaP12F is the optimal STa toxoid for toxoid MEFAs to induce protective anti-STa antibodies will need to be further examined. Human-type STa toxoid STaN12S is suggested an optimal STa toxoid for LT-STa toxoid fusions in inducing neutralizing anti-STa antibodies (Ruan et al., 2014b). But the human-type STa and the porcine-type STa show antigenicity differences, whether the analogue porcine-type STaN11S exhibits better antigenic property needs to be further examined. Nevertheless, antibodies induced by the LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-3xSTaP12F showed neutralizing activity against STa toxin, and protected suckling piglets against LT/STb/STa ETEC infection.",

Unlike live attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines are not optimal for preventing post-weaning diarrhea in pigs because of a higher production cost and the demand for professional training and labor in parenteral immunization to large numbers of individual pigs. Helpfully, the monomeric \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-STaP12F\u2019 MEFA had the STa toxoid, the STb epitope, and the Stx2e epitope embedded at the A1 peptide of LTR192G. This chimeric gene can be modified to express a LT-like holotoxin-structured toxoid MEFA protein. As we demonstrated previously (Ruan and Zhang, 2013), by simply inserting back the nucleotides coding the native leading signal peptides of the LTA subunit gene (eltA) and the LTB subunit gene (eltB), and also the cistron gene structure between the two LT subunit genes, a monomeric LT gene can be reversed to a LT-like gene coding a LT-like holotoxin-structured protein. Since the native LTB gene expresses the LTB subunit and forms LTB pentamer independently, a modified \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-STaP12F\u2019 fusion protein can form LTB pentamer and binds to GM1 receptors in pig small intestine. If expressed by a nonpathogenic E. coli strain, the modified LT-like-structured \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-STaP12F\u2019 toxoid MEFA could be used to develop a live oral vaccine against porcine ETEC diarrhea. Even for the \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-3xSTaP12F\u2019 toxoid MEFA, if all three copies of STaP12F or a different STa toxoid are embedded at the LT A1 peptide, for an example, at the N- and C-terminus of the A1 peptide, the monomeric \u2018LTR192G-STb-Stx2e-3xSTaP12F\u2019 can also be converted to a holotoxin-structured protein and expressed by an E. coli or a Salmonella strain for a live ETEC vaccine candidate.",

Unlike commercially available kits that were used to measure antibody neutralizing activities against LT or STa, we currently do not have standard assays to measure anti-STb and anti-Stx2e antibody neutralizing activities. In this study, we adopted the Vero cell cytotoxicity assay to assess antibody neutralization activities against STb and Stx2e. Future studies to use purified STb or Stx2e toxin instead of bacterial culture filtrates or to adopt a Shiga toxin quantitative microtiter assay (Gentry and Dalrymple, 1980) may measure better anti-Stx2e or anti-STb antibody neutralization activity. In addition, immunizing neonatal piglets and challenging weaned piglets with the LT+, STb+, and STa+ ETEC strains separately will be needed to assess protective efficacy against each toxin, post-weaning diarrhea, and also perhaps Stx2e associated edema disease as described by Oanh et al. (2012). Moreover, large scaled studies are required to evaluate efficacy of candidate vaccines derived from this toxoid MEFA. Results from this study, nevertheless, indicate the toxoid MEFAs can potentially serve as antigens for multivalent vaccines against ETEC associated diarrhea, and may suggest the MEFA strategy may be a useful platform for developing broadly protective vaccines against other heterogeneous pathogenic strains or isolates.",
