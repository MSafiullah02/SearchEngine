More importantly, once fever and/or pneumonia develops, the clozapine dose should be cut in half to decrease the risk of clozapine intoxication. If there is any doubt that in spite of halving the dose there are still signs of clozapine intoxication, completely stopping clozapine may be indicated. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be increased to the prior dosage level.",

In 1994, Bertilsson et al1 described CYP1A2 as its major metabolic pathway. CYP1A2 pharmacology is highly relevant in clozapine dosing. Norclozapine is the main metabolite of clozapine and appears to be mainly eliminated by the kidney, since its conjugated metabolites are present in the urine and the serum free norclozapine is excreted by an unknown renal transporter that can be inhibited by gemfibrozil. With geriatric age, clozapine clearance from the body decreases; this is probably explained by the decrease in renal function and subsequent decrease in renal clearance of norclozapine and other metabolites eliminated in the urine.",

Therefore, smokers tend to have serum concentration values that are approximately 0.80 that of non-smokers when using the same clozapine dose.2 Conversely, oestrogens have inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 activity. Male patients, then, tend to have serum concentration values that are approximately 0.86 that of females when using the same clozapine dose.2 Co-medication with inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampicin increase clozapine metabolism and decrease clozapine levels. The most important inhibitors of clozapine metabolism are ciprofloxacin, oral contraceptives, fluvoxamine and caffeine in high doses. Valproic acid can be an inducer and/or an inhibitor of clozapine metabolism; this varies from patient to patient and over time. During clozapine titration, clinicians should be more concerned about the potential of valproic acid to act as an inhibitor.",

Some of these clozapine ADRs, such as sedation, hypersalivation, constipation and seizures, are dose-related. It is probably more accurate to describe them as serum concentration-related. An expert guideline recommends for efficacy in schizophrenia trough steady-state clozapine concentrations of 350\u2013600 ng/mL.3 This indicates a narrow therapeutic index. The serum concentration of norclozapine does not contribute to antipsychotic efficacy since norclozapine has no antipsychotic activity.

The lower clozapine clearance, probably explained by lower CYP1A2 activity, appears to be present not only in Chinese patients but is also common to other Asians.6 The FDA describes Asians as those people whose ancestral origins range geographically from Pakistan to Japan.6 In Asians, to reach 350 ng/mL, a non-smoking female with average metabolism needs around 150 mg/day and a male smoker 300 mg/day, requiring typical doses in Asians from 150 to 300 mg/day.6 On the other hand, a non-smoking US Caucasian female with average clozapine metabolism needs around 300 mg/day while a US Caucasian male smoker needs 600 mg/day, requiring typical doses in the US from 300 to 600 mg/day.6",

Therefore, the first author reduced the clozapine dose by half8 when he first diagnosed a clozapine intoxication during an upper respiratory infection with fever in one of his patients. The later arrival of the clozapine serum concentration level verified his diagnosis of clozapine intoxication.8 In 2004, based on this case9 and the available literature, he proposed that during severe inflammations/infections, including pneumonia, the clozapine dose should be halved until clozapine levels are available to better personalise clozapine dosing.9 Through 2016, there are 40 published cases of clozapine elevation during infections.10 There are also published clozapine intoxications during severe inflammation without infection.11",

Australia provided >1500 of those reports. Most individual countries from continental Europe provided <30 reports. In the view of Australian experts,17 a 3% incidence rate of clozapine-induced myocarditis in Australia is explained solely by their intensive cardiac monitoring during titration, which is not practiced in other countries. Psychiatrists in continental Europe, on the other hand, titrate their patients slowly and rarely diagnose clozapine-induced myocarditis. In a real-world study with 3262 clozapine patients from the Danish registry, Rohde et al18 found a 0.03% incidence of myocarditis within the first 2 months of treatment. Based on a 3% incidence of myocarditis according to Australian data and a 6% death rate due to lack of cardiac monitoring, six deaths (3% multiplied by 6% is 0.18% and 0.18% of 3262 is six deaths) were expected in that Danish study, but no myocarditis deaths were identified within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment.18",

The history of lamotrigine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome provides further understanding.19 Lamotrigine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome was associated with rapid dose escalation and/or normal titration in patients taking an inhibitor, such as valproic acid. The first sign that the titration is too fast for that patient is usually a skin rash. If the escalation continues, auto-antibodies develop, leading to full-blown Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Therefore, after the first approval, the pharmaceutical company had to reformulate the lamotrigine titration by halving the dose during co-prescription of valproic acid. Similarly, we propose that, first, a clozapine titration that is too fast leads to CRP elevations and/or fever; second, cytokine release decreases clozapine metabolism and this causes a positive feedback mechanism; Third, if the clozapine titration continues, the inflammation evolves into myocarditis, probably with the development of auto-antibodies.",

Then Kuo et al,28 using the Taiwanese registry, demonstrated that clozapine may be the antipsychotic most closely associated with pneumonia. As a matter of fact, compared with other antipsychotics, clozapine may be associated with a greater number of pneumonia cases and greater mortality.16 More importantly, clinicians need to be aware that pneumonia may be among the greatest causes of mortality in clozapine patients. VigiBase had >6000 reports of broadly-defined pneumonia in clozapine patients with >2000 lethal outcomes. To get an accurate perspective, clinicians need to be aware that the broad definitions of agranulocytosis or myocarditis were associated with lethal outcomes in the 500s.16",

Therefore, the contributing effects of the severity level of mental illness on pneumonia needs to be further explored by future studies in clozapine patients.

Assuming that clozapine is associated with immunological abnormalities, this may also explain an increased risk for other types of pneumonia not associated with aspiration. Rarely, other severe clozapine ADRs, such as severe constipation complicated with ileus, or myocarditis, can be complicated by pneumonia. Once pneumonia develops, clozapine co-prescription may be particularly lethal and worse than other antipsychotics. Severe inflammation during pneumonia releases cytokines that inhibit CYP1A2 expression and/or activity and increase serum clozapine concentrations, further increasing the risk of concentration-related ADRs including hypersalivation, sedation, aspiration or even arrhythmia, creating very dangerous positive feedback.16",

The general preventive measures related to infection apply, including patient/family education and use of the lowest possible dosage providing efficacious response. Specific preventive measures for aspiration pneumonia are close monitoring of sedation and hypersalivation. Clozapine administration should be moved around to the most convenient times in order to increase adherence and decrease these ADRs; treat hypersalivation, preferably with local antimuscarinic treatments which may have less risk of increasing the risk of constipation than oral anticholinergic drugs, such as benztropine, or biperiden. Discontinuation of other co-medications associated with sedation and/or pneumonia risk should be considered. As benzodiazepines are associated with sedation, swallowing disturbances and pneumonia, clinicians may need to consider decreasing or discontinuing them to decrease the aspiration pneumonia risk. Although there is no data, it may not be unreasonable to give pneumonia vaccines to clozapine patients to decrease risk of pneumonia not associated with aspiration, but it cannot be ruled out that vaccines may not be as effective in clozapine patients due to clozapine effects on immunological mechanisms.",
