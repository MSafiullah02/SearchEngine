            "text": "The SARS coronavirus is a positive-strand RNA virus. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed to generate the viral replication complex. During viral replication, the replicase polyprotein undergoes extensive processing by two viral proteases namely, chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro).5, 6 Because of their essential roles in viral replication, both proteases are recognized as attractive targets for development of anti-SARS therapeutics.7 The structure and activity of the active sites of both SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro have been elucidated. Thus far, inhibitor design efforts are mostly limited to SARS-CoV 3CLpro and numerous covalent and noncovalent inhibitors have been reported.7 In our continuing interest in the design and development of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, we recently reported structure-based design of a number of potent peptidomimetic SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (1 and 2).8 The SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site contains a catalytic dyad where a cysteine residue acts as a nucleophile and a histidine residue acts as the general acid base.9 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV 3CLpro through a covalent bond with the active site Cys-145 residue. These inhibitors contain peptidomimetic scaffolds and lacked adequate potency, particularly antiviral activity suitable for drug-development. Recently, Wong and co-workers reported a new class of potent small molecule benzotriazole ester-based 3CLpro inhibitors. Compound 3 is the most potent inhibitor among the benzotriazole esters.10 The mode of action involves acylation of the active site Cys-145 assisted by the catalytic dyad. This irreversible enzyme acylation was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the inhibited enzyme. While these inhibitors have shown very impressive SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibitory activity, their antiviral activity required improvement.11 It seems the indole-5-carboxylate moiety plays an important role in binding with the enzyme active site. Another class of hetereoaromatic ester inhibitors was also identified and studied.12, 13 The 5-chloropyridine moiety in 4 proved to be the key unit for the activity against 3CLpro. The report however lacked antiviral data. We report herein the development of 3-chloropyridyl ester-based SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that exhibit potent enzyme inhibitory activity as well as very good SARS-CoV antiviral activity in cell culture assays. We have also carried out molecular docking studies to obtain the potential binding mode of these inhibitors.",

In inhibitor 5, the benzotriazole unit was replaced by a 5-chloropyridine unit. Inhibitor 5 has shown comparable enzymatic inhibitory potency (IC50 0.31 \u03bcM) as that of 3. However, inhibitor 3 did not exhibit any antiviral activity while 5-chloropyridyl ester 5 exhibited antiviral activity with an EC50 value of 24 \u03bcM.18 When the indole nitrogen was acetylated, the resulting compound 6 remained quite potent (IC50 of 0.40 \u03bcM) as did the tosylated indole 7 (IC50 of 0.37 \u03bcM). Interestingly, its nitrobenzenesulfonamide analog 8 shows an improved IC50 value (89 nM). We then investigated the importance of the carboxylic position on the benzene ring of indole. Accordingly, carboxylate substitution on indole rings at 5, 6, 4 and 7 positions resulted in chloropyridinyl esters 5, 9, 10 and 12, respectively. These inhibitors were evaluated and as it turned out, inhibitor 10, with a carboxylate at the 4-position, was the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 30 nM, a 10-fold potency enhancement over 5 containing a carboxylate at the 5-position. Compound 10 also shows the best SARS-CoV antiviral activity with an EC50 value of 6.9 \u03bcM. Acylation of 10\u201311 resulted in a 30-fold loss of potency. Penicillin-derived chloropyridine 13 did not show any appreciable activity. Tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative 14, however, exhibited an enzyme IC50 value of 0.14 \u03bcM. In general, an indole with a free nitrogen is more potent than its corresponding protected analogue.",

GOLD3.221 was used to dock our most active compound, 10 (GRL-0496), into the active site of the authentic SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDBID: 2HOB).22 In search of obtaining a model of the associated complex between the unreacted ester and protein, (i.e. prior to nucleophilic attack by Cys-145), the distance between the carbonyl carbon atom of 10 and the sulfur atom of Cys-145 was constrained to be in the range of 2.5\u20133.5 \u00c5. This pre-reaction or \u2018collision complex\u2019 is shown in Figures 1\nand 2\n, and resulted in a distance of 2.8 \u00c5 between the carbonyl carbon of 10 and the sulfur of Cys-145. This orientation of the ligand has the chloropyridyl group situated in the S1 pocket, with the chloro group pointing towards the surface of the protein. The nitrogen of the chloropyridinyl leaving group is in close proximity (2.4 \u00c5) to the imidazole nitrogen of His-163. The carbonyl oxygen is situated between three backbone nitrogens, forming three hydrogen bonds. As shown in Figure 2: the first hydrogen bond is from Cys-145(NH) (2.3 \u00c5), the second is from Ser-144(NH) (2.4 \u00c5), and the third is from Gly-143(NH) (2.8 \u00c5). This suggests that a fairly strong hydrogen bonding network is present within the active site which likely aids in positioning and stabilizing the carbonyl group of the ester for nucleophilic attack by the Cys-145. The indole group of 10 is positioned near the more hydrophobic S2 pocket, with the indole nitrogen likely interacting with the imidazole group of His-41, see Figure 2.",

This interaction clearly determines the position of the indolyl group of our compounds. Other residues shown in Figure 3, such as Asp-187 and Gln-189 are more than 5 \u00c5 away from the indolyl, but might come into play with larger substituents, such as in compound 11.",

By having both of these models now available, structural modifications of the indole group can be tailored to enhance interactions with the S2 pocket for the complex formation to readily occur, but at the same time, consider that the ligand must be mobile enough to then occupy the S1 pocket post-reaction.",
