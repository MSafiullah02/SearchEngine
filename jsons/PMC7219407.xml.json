The mortality risk attributed to acute cardiac injury was found to be much more significant than that ofage, diabetes, COPDor prior CVD history9\n,\n11\n,\n12.1.Acute cardiac injury is defined aselevation of serum levels of cardiac troponin I/T above 99thpercentile of the upper reference limit OR if new abnormalitieswere shown in echocardiography or ECG14\n,\n15.2.Majority of cardiovascular events in patients with COVID -19 are the result of severe immuneover-reaction by the body called cytokine storm. The evidence of myocarditis in COVID-19 without any evidence of direct viral infiltration points to the deleterious bystander effects on heart12.It is postulated that downregulation of ACE2 occurs due to viral infection, resulting in unopposed action of Angiotensin II with effects such as increased inflammation, hypertension and thrombosis16.3.Second mechanism is the myocardial insult due to hemodynamic stress, respiratory failure and hypoxemia.This produces supply-demand mismatch which leads to myocardial ischemia-what is termed as Type 2 myocardial infarction. (Type 2 MI).4.It is known that the risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) will be more in patients with viral illnesses due to heightened inflammation and thrombotic milieu. But typical Type I MI due to atherosclerotic plaque instability (plaque rupture or erosion)are relatively uncommon.Many of the patients who presented with ST elevation had angiographically normal epicardial coronaries17\n,\n18.5.Another form of cardiac manifestation is myocarditis. It can vary in severity from mild ventricular dysfunction to severe fulminant myocarditis. It is either caused by direct infiltration of the virus into the myocardium but mainlyit is attributedto the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d occurring in response to the systemic inflammation.6.Another mechanism of cardiac injury is similar to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy19 or stress cardiomyopathy, where intense microvascular dysfunction contributes to ventricular dysfunction.7.Cardiac injury usually becomes evident in the second week of the illness and manifests as ECG changes, troponin elevation, ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmias.\n",
