Moreover, we screened preprint servers such as medrxiv and SSRN for relevant articles and consulted the webpages of organisations such as WHO, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the Robert Koch Institute. No reports describing events of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within Europe other than the Bavarian outbreak were identified.\nAdded value of this study\nOriginating from a single travel-associated primary case from China, we describe the first reported cluster of COVID-19 cases with human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Europe and outside of Asia. The outbreak, which resulted in 16 subsequent cases, comprised four generations of virus transmission in only 16 days, corresponding to a median incubation period and serial interval of 4 days. By testing all people who had high-risk contact with confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (and people with low-risk contact upon onset of symptoms), we were additionally able to detect and follow up patients with only very mild clinical symptoms of COVID-19 that would have probably remained undetected otherwise. By combining methods of epidemiology and whole genome sequencing, we were able to reconstruct and describe transmission events precisely. Virus transmission before or on the day of symptom onset or during a prodromal phase was substantial in this outbreak. Moreover, we were able to estimate attack rates according to different scenarios of contact intensity. As of May 2, 2020, no further cases associated with the outbreak were detected, suggesting that applied containment measures have worked.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nIn the beginning of an epidemic caused by a newly discovered virus, the assessment of key epidemiological parameters such as attack rates, incubation period, and serial interval is important, as it provides essential information for estimating the potential size of the epidemic and developing containment measures. Detailed reports on transmission events of SARS-CoV-2, especially in a well described setting, could improve the understanding of transmissibility and further spread of the virus.\n",

Patient 15 is a household member of patient 2 and was asymptomatic. Patients 15 and 16 initially tested negative between Jan 29 and 31 at the company and tested positive when the test was repeated at the end of the follow-up period, thus 12\u201314 days after the last exposure to a case. Retrospectively, patient 16 had experienced a short period of very mild rhinorrhoea from Feb 4 and had not perceived this as a relevant symptom. Two possible transmission options could have occurred for patient 16, through patients 7 and 8, both on Jan 28. Patient 16 participated in the same meeting in which patient 10 was probably infected by patient 7. Patient 16 had also met patient 8 on the same day in a meeting, at a distance greater than 1 m; notably, Jan 28 was also the day of patient 8's symptom onset. Transmission history cannot be resolved because viral sequences in patients 7, 8, 10, and 16 are identical (table 2).",

However, no transmission was documented from asymptomatic patient 15 to the patient's contacts until the end of the observation period (beginning of March, 2020).

It was also a possibility in the transmission from patient 5 to patient 8 and could not be ruled out for the household clusters (ie, transmission from patient 5 to patients 11 and 6 and transmission from patient 11 to patient 9) or transmission from patient 7 to patient 14. Patients 4 and 5 had symptom onset on the same day, which is only plausible if patient 4 shed virus 2 days before symptom onset and patient 5 had a 2-day incubation period. Four transmission events occurred certainly on the day of symptom onset (from patient 3 to patient 12, from patient 5 to patient 7, from patient 7 to patient 10, and from patient 7 or 8 to patient 16) and for one transmission event (patient 5 to patient 8), the only other possibility is presymptomatic transmission (table 1; figure). Five patients were possibly infected when they had contact with their source case at the day of the source case's symptom onset (patients 5 to 8, 5 to 11, 5 to 6, 11 to 9, and 7 to 14; table). Transmission during the prodromal phase of the illness occurred from patient 0 to patients 1, 2, and 4, as well as from patient 3 to patient 12. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 7 days.

Because these 20 household contacts had 80 contact days (mean 4 days), the secondary attack rate can also be expressed as one infection per 40 household contact days.

Although the experience with the cohorted family is based on a single observation, it shows the high risk of close household contacts\u2014ie, sharing a room\u2014of a case in home isolation and calls for strong measures within households to prevent transmission, particularly if susceptible people are present. Among 217 non-household high-risk contacts that were cumulatively followed up because of direct contact with a confirmed case, 11 were infected. The resulting secondary attack rate of 5% seems low, indicating little spread in this cluster. However, more effective spread of the virus might have been prevented by the proactive quarantine of high-risk contacts later identified as cases while still being presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, as well as the proactive closure of the affected company.

Another limitation of our study is that, naturally, not all infectious encounters could be reconstructed. Because the company held larger business and social events during the exposure period, it is possible that an infectious case might have met a successor case so briefly that neither of the two remembered the encounter. Some transmission events were nevertheless confirmed by viral sequencing and population analysis. The contact investigation and interviews followed a general hypothesis of direct human-to-human transmission, and we believe that the concurring epidemiological and genetic results in reconstructing the transmission network support this assumption.",
