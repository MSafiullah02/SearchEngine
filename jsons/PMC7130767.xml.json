Athletes treated with an effective drug regimen usually show improvement of symptoms within 72 hours. A study by Metlay and colleagues [27] looked at time resolution of symptoms in patients who had CAP. Median time to resolution was 3 days for fever, 6 days for dyspnea, 14 days for cough, and 14 days for fatigue [27]. The athlete should be afebrile before return to training and competition. The athlete also should be re-evaluated by the team physician before clearance to assure normalcy of vital signs and respiratory status. It is recommended that exercise and training be resumed slowly when the athlete is able. For example, the first day should involve a 5- to 10-minute light elliptic or stationary bike workout. The athlete should be assessed the next day, and training may be advanced. Athletes can usually return to play sooner if they exercise early in the recovery and benefit psychologically if they see progress is being made.",

Although PCR is a rapid and highly specific test, there is not yet a universally accepted technique. Nasopharyngeal culture is therefore recommended to make the definitive diagnosis [52]. For best yield, the nasopharyngeal swab should be inserted into the base of the nostril and remain in the posterior pharynx for 10 seconds before being withdrawn [48]. In the United States, physicians are legally required to report pertussis cases to state health department officials [53], [54].

The pericardial friction rub is the cardinal physical sign of acute pericarditis [99]. A pericardial rub may have three components per cardiac cycle: high pitched, scratching, and grating [106]. The rub can sometimes be elicited by use of firm pressure with the stethoscope's diaphragm at the left lower sternal border of the chest wall [96], [106]. The rub can often be best appreciated with the patient upright and leaning forward and is often accentuated during inspiration [107]. The physician should also look for signs of cardiac tamponade on examination: hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, and pulsus paradoxus (defined as an inspiratory systolic decrease in arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg during normal breathing) [98].",
