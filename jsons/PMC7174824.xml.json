Human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020). While limited knowledge is available about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we have some experience with other infectious diseases that might have some similar characteristics.",

Despite the early evidence to show that the human-to-human transmission of rates of COVID-19 is lower than SARS (Cascella et al., 2020), compared with its respiratory disease family, SARS and MERS, Peeri et al. (2020) show that COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalisation and the first epicentre's (Wuhan) accessibility. Wu, J.T. et al. (2020) argue that the abundance of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese New Year, and the extraordinary rail accessibility of Wuhan to the rest of China has enabled the virus to spread throughout the country, and eventually, globally, in a very short time.",

Although the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been warned about in the past, the timing and trajectory of it is something very hard to predict. But we have become so blas\u00e9 to the negative side effects of large scale travel and mobility that we consider it normal to do long journeys and expect little to no negative externalities or that someone else is taking care of those, whether they are pollution, injuries, or the break-up of local communities.",

Who knows at the moment how long such a lock down will last in many countries, and further what effect it will have on changing our mobility patterns forever. Will we get used to virtual meetings being the norm for office workers, will we want to connect to local communities more than those far away, will we notice and enjoy cleaner air from less pollution in reduction in transport movement and want to sustain this afterwards? But, given the benefits of mobility are not distributed equally, the disbenefits of mobility lock-down are likely to be faced differently by different populations. People who rely on medicine being delivered or on accessing health and care services, those not connected to the internet, those in more isolated and rural areas, but also those unable to escape those around them living in high density with others, are going to be disproportionally affected. Those that rely on mobility for their work and business may not be able to make ends meet, with jobs at risk without financial support and help from their government.",

(2020), reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days (at a temperature of 30 \u00b0C or more the duration of persistence is shorter). In a recent correspondence van Doremalen et al. (2020) report on findings that suggest that the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 (which causes SARS), the most closely related human coronavirus (Wu, A. et al., 2020), under the experimental circumstances tested. Human coronaviruses can, however, be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute (Kampf et al., 2020). A similar effect against the SARS-CoV-2 may be expected, and preliminary research supports this. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, Kampf et al. (2020) suggest that early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.",

For example, there is an association between acute respiratory infection (ARI) in winter and bus or tram use in the five days before symptom onset (Troko et al., 2011). During the COVID-19 outbreak, as in previous epidemics and pandemics, epidemiologists are encouraging social distancing, meaning people should keep about six feet (or 2 m) or more apart from others.

(this issue) suggests while national rates of daily walking rose slightly from 2001 to 2017, cycling rates remained unchanged. Walking and cycling were highest among well-educated persons, households with low car ownership, and residents of high-density neighbourhoods. They note men were three times more likely to cycle. Similarly, McKay in this issue found boys are more likely to cycle than girls, and early training at around 10 or 11 years of age doesn't impact on later cycling rates. Reilly et al. suggest those taking up shared bike schemes such as New York's CitiBike scheme tend to be young and male and often already physically active being motivated by saving money and getting around quicker, more than physical activity. Could more localised mobility be the norm following enforced isolation or will we go back to normal levels of mobility?",

Cambra and Moura (in this issue) suggest changes in walking levels follow the magnitude of change in walkability of any interventions put in place. Many cyclists might choose low density roads regardless of their speed limits, yet findings from Vanparijs et al. suggest this is dangerous when such roads have high speed limits as they pose a high risk of road traffic collision despite not having high levels of traffic on the roads.
