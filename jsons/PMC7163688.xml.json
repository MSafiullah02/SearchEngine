            "text": "Over the last decades, we have witnessed crises and other complex policy problems in very diverse policy fields; think of BSE, GMOs, swine flu (H1N1), E\u2010coli, volcanic ash, the financial crisis, Ebola, or the refugee crisis. Such problems are increasingly transboundary as modern societies are consisting of a tightly woven web of critical infrastructures crossing geographical borders and policy boundaries (Boin, \u2018t Hart & McConnell, 2009). As a result, risks and crises easily spread over very diverse policy fields, and their regulation is by definition multilevel. In view of the uncertainty inherent to complex policy problems, in the regulation of risk we witness an increasing reliance on scientific knowledge. This embedding of scientific knowledge and expertise in the regulatory system is not always straightforward, however. Let us briefly illustrate this with a well\u2010known case: the BSE crisis (also known as the mad cow disease). Criticism on how this complex policy problem was handled in the 1990s related to the question of how the uncertainty accompanying situations of crisis was tackled and how the scientific expertise played out. Skogstad (2003, 329\u2010330) argued that the BSE crisis was mismanaged, and that we witnessed a \u201cpoliticization of scientific advice,\u201d because the EU regulatory committee responsible for advising the Commission on BSE underplayed the nature and severity of the crisis. Research by Levidow, Carr and Wield (2005) into the role of UK expert advice in the BSE crisis throws a different light on this politicization of scientific advice. They demonstrated that the scientific advice was framed by policy assumptions. Experts tended to give the \u201cscientific\u201d advice that they knew would be politically acceptable; a phenomenon labeled \u201cserviceable truth\u201d by Jasanoff (2015). The politicized expert advice was presented and used as science to justify political decisions on an uncertain risk.",

Scientific knowledge is needed to understand complex policy problems and facilitate decision making. In that context, scientific expertise is increasingly institutionalized in procedures as well as in agencies and governmental and intergovernmental bodies. At the same time scientific knowledge is by definition limited as uncertainty is a defining characteristic of complex policy problems.",

We know that policy responses to one and the same problem can vary considerably between different levels (e.g., Ettelt & Hawkins, 2018; Rinscheid, 2015), and thus we analyse the multilevel handling of a complex policy dossier: the regulation of pandemics via the critical case of the H1N1 pandemic, concentrating on how EU member states, EU agencies and the WHO responded to this crisis. The analysis of the multilevel practice reveals that the attitude toward uncertainty fundamentally differed between the global and the European level. At the global level a classic speaking truth to power approach involved the denial of uncertainty, while at the EU level the assigned role of providing scientific expertise was interpreted as a necessity to openly communicate about uncertainty. While the global approach was heavily criticized, the uncertainty communication at the European level was much appreciated.",

This dissatisfaction stemmed from the increasing belief that the traditional way of thinking about organizational decision\u2010making \u2013 there is a problem, we define the possible decision alternatives, we examine their potential consequences, and we finally decide \u2013 does not capture reality sufficiently. This is the time period in which Rittel and Webber (1973) introduced their work on \u201cwicked problems.\u201d According to this line of thinking simple problems are those where problem definition and solution to the problem are understood. Such simple problems are also referred to as \u201ctame\u201d problems. Tame problems are easy to define, information needed to solve the problem is available, and there is consensus on both the problem and the solution. Wicked problems are those where both nature and solution are uncertain and controversial (Durant & Legge, 2006). As Rittel and Webber (1973, 161) put it: \u201cThe formulation of a wicked problem is the problem!\u201d (emphasis in original). Wicked problems occur when institutional complexity, scientific and/or cognitive uncertainty, and social pluralism (that is, multiple interests and values of stakeholders) reach their maximum values (Head & Alford, 2015). The article by Fossum (2019) in this symposium provide a clear topical example of how the Brexit can be seen as a prime example of a wicked problem.",

More recently, we witness pleas for evidence\u2010based policy\u2010making, in which a solution to wicked problems is sought in an increase in the quality and quantity of information, i.e. evidence. However, as Newman and Head (2017, 423) point out, evidence can never be a cure for wicked problems as there is never an objective solution for such problems; something that we see highlighted in the understanding of complex policy problems as uncertain risks as well. The last couple of years the wicked problems literature has been criticized for its wicked/tame dichotomy, arguing that most policy problems inherently show some wicked elements \u2013 \u201calmost any problem is difficult to solve\u201d (Peters, 2017, 386) \u2013 and we should better understand complex policy problems as an index of degrees of problematicity or structuredness (Turnbull & Hoppe, 2018, 12).",

The core reason for the inherent uncertainty is that these risks are unforeseen side effects of the industrialized modernity, while science does not provide us with the necessary knowledge to manage them in the current policy framework (Taylor\u2010Gooby & Zinn, 2006). Following Perrow (1984), we have come to realize that the more we depend on complex systems such as nuclear power, the more we need to accept the possibility of accidents. Uncertainty is the product of innovation (Nowotny, 2008). And thus uncertainty becomes a fundamental part of the modern risk society. van Asselt and Vos (2008) (see also van Asselt & Renn, 2011)therefore propose to talk about uncertain risks to refer to complex policy problems which involve potential new hazards rooted in technological and societal developments. Uncertain risks involve suspicions about possible, new and imaginable hazards, with which we have no or only limited experience. They usually involve complex causalities and multiple heterogeneous and long\u2010term effects.",

It was assumed for a long time that risks can be understood as an objective entity whereby a risk equals the probability of an occurrence multiplied by the extent of damage. However, this perspective on risk is past\u2010based and concentrates on hazards which have manifested themselves in the past, hence on familiar dangers. Innovation and globalization, however, influence the levels of complexity and uncertainty, making the reliance on and acceptance of probabilistic calculations increasingly impossible (Taylor\u2010Gooby & Zinn, 2006). Necessary information on probability and extent of damage is often not available and principally unattainable in the situation of uncertain risks, in turn affecting the role of scientific expertise. At the same time, the higher the levels of ambiguity and uncertainty, the more difficult it becomes for policy\u2010makers to define their preferences, and the more they tend to turn to experts and scientific advice. But all such advice is embedded in prior, socially derived framing assumptions (Jasanoff & Wynne, 1998), so that we need to realize that there is no knowledge without interests (Radaelli, 1999).",

The way in which a country regulates risks is linked to prevailing risk perceptions and levels of uncertainty intolerance (van Asselt & Vos, 2008). This is by no means static. Vogel (2012) for example argued that while in the United States risk regulation was more risk averse than the approach of the European Union in the period of 1960\u20131990 (particularly in the field of health safety), this relative transatlantic stringency reversed and we arguably witness a more stringent risk regulation in the EU since around 1990. Regulating uncertain risks is complex, particularly in contexts where there is diversity in political cultures, regulatory frameworks, and standards in risk assessment.",

(2009, 83\u20104) who describe them as \u201cevents or developments widely perceived by members of relevant communities to constitute urgent threats to core community values and structures.\u201d A crisis is often triggered by a \u201cfocusing event\u201d (Kingdon, 1995), which is an \u201cevent that is sudden, relatively rare, can be reasonably defined as harmful or revealing the possibility of greater potential future harms\u201d (Birkland, 2006, 2). Crises are considered to be induced by (in)actions of an organization. Crises are increasingly spanning boundaries (May, Jochim & Sapotichne, 2011) and jump across geographical borders, functional borders, and traditional time borders and are harder to pinpoint in terms of starting and ending time. Crises are therefore labeled as ill\u2010structured problems \u2013 i.e. instances where there is no clarity of the definition of the problem, the extent to which it is independent of other problems, and the adequacy of the knowledge base for coping with the problem (Simon, 1973) \u2013 or messes (Mitroff, Alpaslan & Green, 2004) and can be conceptualized as manifestations of complex policy problems.",

Because of the complex significance of uncertainty (van Asselt, 2005), scientific expertise plays a crucial, however ambiguous, role in dealing with complex policy problems. Slovic (1999, 689) summarizes this very nicely, when he states that decision making about complex policy problems, but also in general, is \u201cinherently subjective and represents a blending of science and judgment with important psychological, social, cultural, and political factors.\u201d Boin (2004) argues that in view of uncertain risks and the wicked nature of policy problems, crisis prevention is essentially impossible. Rather than trying to prevent crises, organizations should become resilient and learn to cope with unanticipated dangers and learn to bounce back (Wildavsky, 1988).",

            "text": "Although we realize that the brief synthesis does not do justice to the various rich scholarly bodies of knowledge, it is clear that dealing with uncertainty and scientific expertise is key in dealing with the multilevel governance of complex policy issues. Expertise is not purely objective (Levidow & Carr, 2007), but expert advisers work hard to enact objectivity. Hilgartner (2000) argues that expertise is never purely objective because it is shaped and formed by contextual factors. When expertise would be transparent, it would make this subjectivity visible. Thus experts often \u201chide,\u201d or \u201cbackstage\u201d certain information in order to be able to deliver \u201cserviceable truths\u201d (Jasanoff, 2015) and \u201cplausibility proofs\u201d (van Asselt & Vos, 2008). Supposedly politically and socially neutral input (Millstone & van Zwanenburg, 2001) then serves as a cornerstone in the governance of wicked problems, uncertain risks and crises. We are in danger of a situation that van Asselt and Vos (2008) label as the \u201cuncertainty paradox\u201d: a situation in which uncertainty is acknowledged, but the role of science is still framed as one of providing certainty. Such situations can easily lead to a politicization of uncertainty (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1990); a process in which uncertainties that relate to their interests are emphasized, amplified, or attenuated by politicians or other relevant stakeholders. In other words, uncertainty is used in political and societal debates to achieve particular ends. So it is not a genuine concern about uncertainty and an attempt to responsibly deal with it, but a particular framing of uncertainty with a certain effect. As a way out of this politicization of uncertainty, it should be much more common practice for governmental actors to provide \u201cuncertainty information.\u201d In other words, \u201cargumentation about which uncertainties are important and why, disclosure of sources of uncertainty, and discussing whether and how uncertainty can be reduced and which interpretations of uncertainty are deemed valid\u201d (van Asselt, 2005, 143).",

We aim to investigate how uncertainty and scientific expertise are dealt with and how this relates to the way in which scientific expertise is embedded in the regulatory multilevel governance design. To that end, we have selected the H1N1 pandemic as a critical case. In his analysis of the preceding H5N1 avian influenza, DeLeo (2010) labeled this as an \u201canticipatory\u2010conjectural problem.\u201d These are the type of problems that can be anticipated as a potential threat, but we \u201crarely know how or when an anticipatory\u2010conjectural problem will occur. Nor can we predict the scope or severity of these problems\u201d (DeLeo, 2010, 151). We follow this characterization of pandemics, although we realize that the H1N1 situation was different from the H5N1 case before in that it was much more fast\u2010moving. Due to the complexity, sensitivity and its scale, this pandemic can be characterized as a typical case of complex policy problems because \u201cby definition, potentially pandemic agents such as H1N1 are novel, complex, variable, and ill\u2010understood\u2026 (and) the scientific knowledge produced surrounding pandemic risk therefore tends to be anecdotal (based upon necessarily limited evidence and relatively few initial cases) and theoretically speculative (based on hypothetical models of future spread and pathogenicity)\u201d (Abeysinghe, 2014, 515). This pandemic represents an anticipatory\u2010conjectural uncertain risk that manifested itself as a crisis. It transcended geographical boundaries, making multilevel regulation a necessity. It is therefore a strategic research site that enables us to investigate the phenomena we are interested in.",

The EU agencies involved in this case were particularly the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for providing advice on the handling of the pandemic, and to a lesser extent the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the authorisation of the required vaccines (see Deruelle, 2016 for more insight into the setting up of ECDC). National health authorities within the EU member states remain responsible for executing their own pandemic preparedness plans and for deciding on potential vaccination strategies.

Criticism is raised on the WHO moving too quickly to the final phase (Phase 6), as a result of a recent chance in the criteria for pandemic alert. Due to this chance in 2009, the criterion related to the severity of the disease was removed as a precondition for moving to Phase 6. The Council of Europe (2010, 10) argues that the WHO moved to this final phase while already knowing that there was empirical evidence that the influenza was milder than expected. One month prior to moving to Phase 6, Chan (head of the WHO) actually discussed the moderate severity of H1N1 during a press conference (European Parliament, 2011, 13). In addition, it is stated that the WHO recalled the pandemic too late (European Parliament, 2011).",

            "text": "In addition, our content analysis of ECDC documents reveals an entirely different approach to providing uncertainty information compared to the WHO. On 24 April 2009 ECDC posted its first threat assessment, and ECDC downgraded the crisis in January 2010 (much earlier than WHO which did so in August 2010). In contrast with the WHO, ECDC provided uncertainty information and kept stressing the uncertainty and highlighted what we do not know yet (\u201cknown unknowns\u201d; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010, 7). During the starting phase of the pandemic, information on the outbreak \u201cwas largely incomplete\u201d (Greco, Stern & Marks, 2011, 26), and this was clearly acknowledged by ECDC in its documents. In its first rapid risk assessment of 24 April, ECDC concludes that \u201cit is too early to say whether this will lead to a larger outbreak\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a, 4). Furthermore, when outlining the implications for the EU, ECDC was open and explicit about the scarce data available on the virus. It lists characteristics that help decide the size, speed, and seriousness of a potential pandemic, and in each point ECDC states: \u201cInfectivity: We do not know\u2026 At present, it seems as if\u2026 but this assessment may change\u2026; Reproduction rate: Unknown\u2026; Immunity: We do not know\u2026; etc.\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009a, 2\u20133). As more data became available, the third update of ECDC's risk assessment published on 12 June provided more detailed and new information on the virus, and ECDC provided a list of topics that can and cannot be assumed under the name \u201cknown knowns\u201d and \u201cknown unknowns\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 2). ECDC consistently acknowledged uncertainty, as can be seen in the use of expressions such as \u201cTo date there is no evidence\u2026; It is difficult to estimate\u2026; There are as yet no reports of\u2026; It is difficult at this stage to comment on\u2026; Though it seems that\u2026this picture is still unclear\u2026\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009b, 3\u20135). ECDC is also aware of \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d which describe that \u201cthere are always things that surprise about each pandemic.\u201d1 ECDC presents a menu of possible public health measures that can be adopted by national policy\u2010makers and decision makers during an influenza pandemic in one of its technical reports. Here, the agency stresses that there are \u201cmore gaps than certainties\u2026 (and) significant holes in our knowledge\u201d and \u201c[t]he evidence base for the use of the measures against influenza is limited and primarily comprises anecdotal observations\u2026\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009c, 9). This report provides specific policy advice regarding several measures for travel, personal protection, public places, antivirals, etc. and in all these proposed measures ECDC clearly states what is known and unknown as well as how much evidence is available. Regarding general mask\u2010wearing in public places, for instance, ECDC states that its effectiveness is unknown as \u201cthere is no trial and few other data\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009c, 19). Similarly, when it comes to pandemic vaccines, \u201cthere are considerable uncertainties and some risks\u2026 and any adverse effects will need to be watched for carefully as there will be no time for ordinary trials\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009c, 31). In sum, ECDC is very explicit in acknowledging what is known and what is unknown, and is thus explicit in providing uncertainty information. Whenever its documentation is offering policy advice, this advice is always phrased in a context. For example, there is explicit recognition of the fact that specific advice is likely to play out differently in different EU member states. As illustrated by the following statement: \u201c\u2026given the above considerations, these plans should have considerable flexibility and command and control structures that will allow changes to be made quickly in the light of new data and experience. \u2026 Because of Europe's diversity, no single combination of measures will suit every European setting: one size will not fit all\u201d (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2009c, 2).",

While the WHO provided rather prescriptive guidance, the ECDC provided more uncertainty information and when it did issue specific guidance, it clearly illustrated how this situation would likely play out differently in different member states. Insight into how EU member states responded to the pandemic reveals that the response was very diversified, particularly regarding the way in which vaccines were handled. In most cases, national governments had predetermined \u201csleeping contracts,\u201d or \u201cadvance purchase agreements,\u201d that oblige countries to buy predetermined numbers of vaccines. There was an automaticity of contracts with industry coming into effect once WHO signals a pandemic of Phase 6 (Baekkeskov, 2016, BMJ, 2010, Council of Europe, 2010). This led to pressure on national governments to speed up their decision making.

The reserved countries, with Poland as the clearest case, did not automatically initiate vaccination campaigns and did not purchase large quantities of vaccines. The Polish response was handled in close cooperation with the ECDC. The Polish minister for health stated that she took responsibility, and would not accept the conditions imposed by the pharmaceutical industry. The British government, in contrast, started its approach from the worst case scenario and predicted 65,000 deaths (Council of Europe, 2010, 16\u201017). This in the end led the United Kingdom to spend 1,300 million Euro on H1N1 related actions \u2013 compared to around 87 million Euro for an average seasonal influenza (European Parliament, 2011, 13).
