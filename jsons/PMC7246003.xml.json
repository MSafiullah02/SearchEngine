            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious airborne life-threatening viral infection causing recurrent outbreaks of humans responsible for respiratory diseases and death. It was estimated during 2017\u20132018 that there were 959,000 hospitalizations and 79,400 deaths (CDC 2018) alone in the United States related to influenza illness. Moreover, WHO estimates that 3\u20135 million people suffer from the disease every year with death rate ranging between 290,000 and 650,000 due to influenza epidemics (Influenza (Seasonal) 2018) worldwide (Sherman et al. 2019). Of note, previous epidemiological studies on pandemic A/H1N1 during the year 2009 clearly showed that the severity of influenza was not so high in individuals effected with HIV compared with HIV-negative patients (Martinez et al. 2011; Perez et al. 2010). This clearly shows that influenza remains a major target for vaccine and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. One of the causes of the severity of the disease is due to influenza replication and transcription played by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is composed of three subunits i.e., polymerase basic1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic (PA) (Fodor 2013; Resa-Infante et al. 2011). Both PB1 and the N-terminus of PB2 form a large central cavity for catalytic mechanism of influenza-A virus (IAV) viral replication (Hengrung et al. 2015; Pflug et al. 2014; Reich et al. 2014). The priming loop of (a \u03b2-hairpin structure) PB1 thumb domain protrudes into the central cavity and supports the sugar base of the first NTP during de nova initiation (Reich et al. 2014; Appleby et al. 2015; Butcher et al. 2001; Tao et al. 2002). Moreover, primer-independent replication on the viral RNA (vRNA) template was also initiated by the priming loop (Te Velthuis et al. 2016). However, no drug exits presently in the market that blocks the entry of putative NTP and inhibits the initiation of vRNA priming loop occupying to the catalytic site of IAV RdRp. Apart from the catalytic site, IAV RdRp contains multiple sites for potential antivirus drug development due to its high conservation among different strains (Babar et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Recently, four different active sites of IAV RdRp were predicted computationally (Pagadala 2019). At present, three major classes of drugs are under development for influenza: RNA synthesis inhibitors, cap-snatching inhibitors, and inhibitors targeting protein\u2013protein interactions between the three polymerase subunits (e.g., PA\u2013PB1, PB1\u2013PB2). Inhibition of IAV RNA synthesis during chain elongation is mainly inhibited by nucleoside mimicking\u2019s such as favipiravir (T-705), 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoroguanosine (Furuta et al. 2009; Tisdale et al. 1995). On the other hand, the pyrazine carboxamide derivatives (T-1105 and T-1106) show different antiviral activity on the type of host cells used. Both ribavirin and its amidine prodrug viramidine are converted to ribavirin monophosphate and acts on cellular enzyme inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase leading to the inhibition of vRNA synthesis (Sidwell et al. 2005; Ghanem et al. 2007). In comparison with ribavirin, cytotoxicity of viramidine is lesser which lead to further evaluation as a possible anti-influenza viral therapy. Unlike ribavirin, the influence of T-705 on cellular DNA or RNA synthesis was negative, indicating its high specificity and lesser cytotoxicity. Recently, a set of compounds that were screened targeting IAV RNA synthesis revealed that 2\u2032F-2\u2032dNTP nucleoside analogs inhibit cPol and vPol in a completely different way (Reich et al. 2017). A combination therapy of amantadine and oseltamivir as well as favirpiravir and oseltamivir in H5N1 infected mice has shown increased in drug efficacy (Ilyushina et al. 2007). Although the combination of oseltamivir and ribavirin was shown effective, ribavirin has shown some undesirable toxic effects. Recently, combination therapy with three antiviral drugs (amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir) has shown a strong effect on drug-resistant viruses including pH1N1 influenza in Korea (Kim et al. 2011). In continuation, the TCDA therapy also showed similar pharmacokinetics compared with mono-drug therapy with increased safety in immune compromised patients (Kim et al. 2011; Seo et al. 2013).",

In addition, the binding modes of 11 NTPs against IAV RdRp were predicted and their dihedral angles \u03a6T C (2\u2032) -C (1\u2032) -N (1) -N (5)/C (6) and \u03a6P O (5\u2032) -C (1\u2032) -N (1) - N (5)/C (6) that play an important role in ligand binding were analyzed. Furthermore, 25% (IC25), 50% (IC50), and 95% (EC95) effective concentrations of these 11 NTPs were calculated for IAV RdRp inhibition using trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation assay (Pagadala 2019).

In the presence of Influenza-A vRNA with extended primer, and III. In the presence of influenza-B vRNA using MOE (Chemical computing group, Montreal, Canada) (Pagadala 2019). Initially, the ligand was optimized by energy minimization with TAFF forcefield until the energy gradient is below 0.001 Kcal/Mol (Clark et al. 1989). Totally 1000 docking poses for each ligand were generated using implicit generalized born solvation model and ligand placement method \u201cAlpha PMI\u201d with London dG scoring function. The initial and final scoring of the top docking poses were refined using the same London dG scoring function calculated with TAFF forcefield (Mackerell et al. 2004). At the end, global minimum of the ligand was predicted using the simulated annealing based on the Monte Carlo method (Metropolis et al. 1953). Finally, the affinity of the docking poses as the sum of the electrostatic, and Van der Waals energies were ranked with \u0394G (U total in kcal/Mol). The reaction model cutoff between 8 and 10 \u00c5 as a dielectric function with the pocket radius of 6 \u00c5 was included in our docking studies. In total, the 30 docking conformations were retained as a cutoff.",

The purified influenza virus A/PR/8/34/H1N1 obtained from Charles River (MD) was disrupted with 2.5% Triton N-101 and diluted 1:2 with 0.25% Triton N-101. Disruption provided the source of influenza ribonucleoprotein (RNP) containing the IAV RdRp and template vRNA. Samples were stored on ice until use in the assay. Six serial half-log dilutions of the test drugs (twelve drugs) at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 \u03bcM and positive control 2\u2032Deoxy-2\u2032fluoroguanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (high tests of 100 \u00b5M) were tested in triplicate. Each polymerase reaction contained the following: disrupted RNP, Tris-HCl, KCl, MgCl2, Dithiothreitol, 0.25% Triton N-101, [\u03b1-32P] GTP, ATP, CTP, UTP, GTP, and Adenyl (3\u2032\u20135\u2032) Guanosine. For testing the inhibitor, the reactions contained the inhibitor and the same was done for reactions containing the positive control. The reaction was incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h, transferred onto glass-fiber filter plates and subsequent precipitation of nucleic acids with 10% TCA. The filters were then washed with 5% TCA followed by 95% ethanol and air dried. Once the filter has dried, incorporation of [\u03b1-32P] GTP was measured using a scintillation counter (Micro beta). Radioactivity was measured in a Micro beta liquid scintillation counter. Negative control reactions were prepared by omitting RNP complexes, whereas, positive control reactions for polymerase inhibitors contained the specific inhibitor 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-Fluoroguanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate. Inhibition of viral polymerase activity was measured by IC25, IC50, and IC95 in triplicate (Pagadala 2019).",

The docking studies in the Stage-I and III confirm that all these linear and V-shaped compounds 1\u20133 except compound 11 with influenza-A vRNA commonly binds to the catalytic site around the priming loop of PB1 domain. However, compounds 10 and 11 occupies the catalytic site while the rest of the molecules bind to tunnel 2 in the presence of capped primer from \u02786 polymerase. Both the cyclic compounds 7 and 8 along bind near to the exit channel below the linker domain in Stage-III, although compound 7 binds to catalytic site in Stage-I. Previous studies also shown that the known compound AZT-TP bind near to the exit channel below the linker domain (Pagadala 2019). Further, the results obtained using regression analysis with R2 = 0.73 shows that binding modes of the compounds 1\u20137 in Stage-I are the most probable conformations that bind to IAV RdRp. Thus, the docked conformations of compounds 1\u20137 from Stage-I were only discussed further.",

            "text": "Ligand protein interactions show that the compounds 1\u20133 in Stage-I primarily interact with PB2-N, residue nearby motif-II and motif-IV, and the PB1 priming loop that plays an important role in stabilizing the ligand-target interaction. In particular, Met646, Pro647, and Ala648 of the priming loop of PB1 are the key residues stabilizing the compounds 1 and 3 scaffolds within the catalytic site of the IAV RdRp. This binding orientation in turn shields Asp445 and Asp446 essential for polymerase activity of influenza virus within the catalytic site (Zamyatkin et al. 2008). These two residues coordinate the metal ions involved in the catalysis. When either of these Asp\u2013Asp residues were mutated, Asp445His and Asp446Tyr, Asn, or Glu, the catalytic activity of PB1 is completely abolished (Biswas and Nayak 1994). The Asp446 may deprotonate the 3\u2032hydroxy group of the priming NTP by acting as a general base and helps the \u03b1-phosphate of the NTP to be incorporated into the activator strand. The suitable geometry for the reaction to happen is provided by His649 of the priming loop. Mutational analysis of His649A and Pro647A individually, impair terminal de novo initiation on a vRNA promoter with P651A having the strongest effect (Te Velthuis et al. 2016). To coordinate with the catalytic magnesium ion, the conformational change of Asp446 side chain with 3.5 \u00c5 is required to allow the polymerase to initiate polymerization. Apart from these interactions, compounds 1 and 3 have the ability to disturb the structural stability of priming loop by interacting with nearby residues Pro647 and Ala648 of PB1 central domain. However, compound 2 may disturb the structural stability of PB2-N required for subunit binding to PB1-C by interacting with Asn42 and Ala44 of PB2-N. Structural analysis has shown that N-terminus of PB1 established a crucial high-affinity interaction with C-terminal domain of the PA protein (Reuther et al. 2011). Based on the binding modes, it might be speculated that compounds 1\u20133 may induce some structural changes of motifs-II and IV involved in the formation of catalytic mechanism and putative NTP tunnel formation. Mutational analysis of Lys481 of motif-IV to Gln and Arg caused a drastic reduction in catalytic activity of PB1 ranging from 1 to 7% compared with wild-type which shows the importance of this amino acid in the viral replicase transcriptase activity of PB1 (Biswas and Nayak 1994). The conserved residues of motif D, Lys480 and Lys481 involved in NTP binding is further stabilized by contacts with PA helix \u03b120 (656\u2013663) and the PA peptide 671\u2013684 (Pflug et al. 2014). Thus, our compounds 1\u20133 interferes in stacking interactions between His649, P651 with the incoming NTP by binding to the catalytic site and inhibit the activity of the viral polymerase.",

            "text": "Furthermore, binding mode analysis revealed that compounds 4, 5, and 6 may disturb the structural stability of motif-IV by interacting the nearby residues mainly with Phe501 and Val502 of PB1 central. More likely PB1 Phe501 plays a main role in IAV RdRp inhibition of these compounds 4, 5, and 6 in tunnel 2 above the PB1 priming loop. However, this residue acts as an electron donor for compound 5 inhibition, while the same residue acts as an electron acceptor for IAV RdRp inhibition by compounds 4 and 6. Plausibly, the side chains of Arg142, Lys279, and Lys670 create a favorable environment with a positive electrostatic potential for the binding of these compounds with high potency in TCA precipitation assay. In addition, compounds 4 and 5 might be associated with less conformational changes of PB2 linker domain by tight binding with Lys670 of PB2 627 domain. This contact may show the impact on the viral genome transcription and replication by influenza polymerase. These results also reveal that compounds with 2\u2032deoxycytidine-5\u2032triphosphate and di-adenosine Penta phosphate are more potent than other molecules used in the study with 0.09 and 0.21 \u00b5M. This may be due to inhibition of influenza virus RNA polymerase by incorporating in place of CTP and ATP. Previously, McGeoch and Kitron showed that IAV RdRp was stimulated by GpG and GpC (McGeoch and Kitron 1975). Later, plotch and krug had reported that initiation of IAV RdRp cRNA can be stimulated by ApG and GpG dinucleotides which are incorporated at the 5\u2032end of the cRNA (Plotch and Krug 1977). This enhancement of IAV RdRp by GpC and ApG is abolished by compounds 4, 5, and 6 more likely by compounds 5 and 6 than compound 4 in the series. Even though, the binding site of compounds 7 and 8 is the same at the end of the tunnel 2, compound 7 may have a different mechanism of action by donating electrons to Gly275 of linker that leads to the PB2-N2 subdomain and induce conformational changes of PA endonuclease.",

            "text": "By determining the IC50 profiles for each of these seven compounds tested experimentally, it was proved that compounds 1\u20137 and AZT-TP that was published previously were competitively inhibiting the incorporation of GTP into viral RNA of influenza polymerase (Pagadala 2019). This is in good correlation between our docking studies showing that these compounds bind to catalytic and linker domains and prevent the activity of influenza RdRp similar to positive control 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoroguanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate. This also implies that compounds 1\u20133 may disturb the initiation of replication by inhibiting the incoming NTPs and compounds 4\u20137 may terminate viral elongation by adding the next correct nucleotide. The results also suggest that the compounds 1\u20137 after binding to the catalytic site and exit channel inhibit the nucleophilic attack of the 3\u2032-OH on the \u03b1-phosphorous of the incoming NTP. For all the compounds 4, 5, 6, and 7 that demonstrated inhibitory activities, the IC50 values were less than onefold better compared with IC50 of 1.66 \u03bcM of the known compound 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoroguanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate. Even though compounds 8\u201311 did not inhibit viral replication in TCA precipitation assay, they all bound to the influenza catalytic site. Similar to compounds 1\u20137, these molecules might not exhibit anti-influenza activity, perhaps due to premature degradation or they may bind away from the catalytic site as explained in Stage-II and III. Structural analysis of these compounds indicates that both indole ring and sulfonyl groups of V-shaped compounds 1\u20133 might play a major role in binding to the catalytic site of the viral polymerase. Previously, it was also shown that the effect of viral inhibition was high with compound A3 that contains an indole ring when compared with its derivate A3 that lack the indole ring. On the other hand, the high IC50 of linear chain compounds 4 and 5 shows that high flexibility of desthiobiotin and N4-biotin might play an important role in destabilizing PB2 linker of the viral polymerase. In addition, destiobiotin may form destiobiotin-GTP complex through conjugation while N4-biotin may form N4-biotin-\u03b5-Lys670 affecting the viral replication in TCA precipitation assay. However, the high IC50 of linear chain compound 6 may be due the presence of di-adenosine that leads to an increase in prolongation of transcription elongation competing with the natural substrates. Considering the binding orientation, it clearly appears that a \u03c0-stacking between Phe495 and 2\u2032-tosyl-N2-isobutyryl-guanosine of compound 7 may play an additional role in the inhibition of viral polymerase activity with an IC50 of 0.68 \u00b5M.",

Docking studies indicated that linear shape compounds 4, 5, and 6 may induce conformational changes of PB1 motif-IV and PB2 linker domain with an IC50 of 0.21 and 0.09 \u00b5M. Whereas, V-shaped compounds 1, 2, and 3 destabilize the PB1 priming loop involved in initiation of viral replication showing an IC50 of 1.69, 3.58, and 2.13 \u00b5M. However, cyclic compound 8 even though binds nearer to motif-IV of PB1 central domain showed a moderate inhibition with an IC50 of 0.68 \u00b5M. This in turn indicates that the known compound 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxy-thymidine-5\u2032-triphosphate binds to the viral promoter while the positive control 2\u2032deoxy-2\u2032fluoroguanosine triphosphate binds near to the exit channel inhibiting the transcriptional activity of viral polymerase with the same IC50 of 1.12 \u00b5M (Pagadala 2019). A good correlation between the \u0394G and IC50 values with an R2 = 0.73 indicate that these molecules bind to the catalytic site inhibiting the incorporation of natural NTPs for replication initiation and elongation of IAV RdRp. The compounds 5 and 6 exhibit significant antiviral effect inhibiting the viral replication with lower IC50 of 0.09 \u00b5M compared with other compounds used in the study. Thus, this study clearly demonstrates the importance of catalytic site below and above the priming loop for the development of effective anti-influenza drugs. The evaluation of these compounds in further experimental studies will pay the way to develop small molecule therapeutic that can inhibit the IAV viral replication binding to the catalytic site and satisfy Lipinski\u2019s rule of five.",
