SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with a diameter between 60 and 140 nm. It is considered to be a new type of coronavirus, belonging to the genus of betacoronavirus.1 A study shows that SARS-CoV-2 has 86.9% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1).2 The host is generally considered to be a Rhinolophus sinicus; whether an intermediate host is required has not been proved.1 Some studies claimed that pangolin or snake might play the role of intermediate host.3\n,\n4 However, the main source of infection comes from COVID-19 pneumonia patients currently. According to current knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 is heat-sensitive and can be inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min.1 Ultraviolet radiation, and lipid solvents (such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform et al.), can also effectively inactivate the SARS-CoV-2, while chlorhexidine is insufficient to inactivate the virus.1\n",

A familial cluster study of COVID-19 suggests that of six COVID-19 patients, five patients' nasopharyngeal swab samples showed SARS-CoV-2 positive. Of the four throat swab samples, three showed SARS-CoV-2 positive. Meanwhile, One of two serum samples showed SARS-CoV-2 positive.6 Patients may feel uncomfortable and induce pharyngeal reflex under ENT physical examination, leading to the production of SARS-CoV-2 viral droplets or aerosols. This scenario also happens when patients are talking, coughing, or sneezing, which can spread the virus as far as 3\u20138 m.10\n,\n11 Thus, health care workers, especially those in the otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery clinic, are extremely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, who should be defined as high-risk exposure populations.10 We recommend reducing unnecessary physical examinations in the ENT Clinic in COVID-19 epidemic areas. For COVID-19 patients who in urgent need to be examined, the medical precautions should base on Grade II precautions. For processes that are at high risk of inducing SARS-CoV-2 viral droplets, or aerosols, such as endoscope examination, emergency tracheotomy or hemostasis of epistaxis, Grade III precautions should be warranted for health care workers.10\n,\n14\n",

However, a former study showed that typical pathological changes can only be seen 96 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection.2 Another study claimed that COVID-19 has an incubation period of 4.1\u20137.0 days.5 Therefore, within 96 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient is likely to have no typical chest CT manifestations but is still contagious. Cases report in a familial cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that a 10-year-old child, who has no clinical symptoms of fever, cough or diarrhea, with normal blood routine, showed typical changes in chest CT,6 suggesting that normal blood routine cannot rule out COVID-19 either.",
