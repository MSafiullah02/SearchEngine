Fishman, MD With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) across many fields and subspecialties, there are considerable expectations for transformative impact. However, there are also concerns regarding the potential abuse of AI. Many scientists have been worried about the dangers of AI leading to \"biased\" conclusions, in part because of the enthusiasm of the inventor or overenthusiasm among the general public. Here, though, we consider some scenarios in which people may intend to cause potential errors within data sets of analyzed information, resulting in incorrect conclusions and leading to potential problems with patient care and outcomes.",

            "text": "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a recently developed deeplearning model aimed at creating new images. It simultaneously trains a generator and a discriminator network, which serves to generate artificial images and to discriminate real from artificial images, respectively. We have recently described how GANs can produce artificial images of people and audio content that fool the recipient into believing that they are authentic. As applied to medical imaging, GANs can generate synthetic images that can alter lesion size, location, and transpose abnormalities onto normal examinations (Fig. 1 ) [1] . GANs have the potential to improve image quality, reduce radiation dose, augment data for training algorithms, and perform automated image segmentation [2] . However, there is also the potential for harm if these artificial images infiltrate our health care system by hackers with malicious intent. As proof of principle, Mirsky et al [3] showed that they were able to tamper with CT scans and artificially inject or remove lung cancers on the images. When the radiologists were blinded to the attack, this hack had a 99.2% success rate for cancer injection and a 95.8% success rate for cancer removal. Even when the radiologists were warned about the attack, the success of cancer injection decreased to 70%, but the cancer removal success rate remained high at 90%. This illustrates the sophistication and realistic appearance of such artificial images. These hacks can be targeted against specific patients or can be used as a more general attack on our radiologic data. It is already challenging enough to keep up with the daily clinical volume when the radiology system is running smoothly. Our clinical workflow would be paralyzed if we could not trust the authenticity of the images and must spend extra effort searching for evidence of image tampering in every case.",

As deep-fake technology gets more sophisticated, there is emerging research on AI-driven defense strategies. One example features the training of an AI to detect artificial images by image artifacts induced by GAN [6] . However, AI-driven defense mechanisms have a long way to catch up, as seen in the related problem of defense against adversarial attacks. Recognizing these challenges, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has launched the Media Forensics program to research against deep fakes [7] . Hence, for now, the best defense against deep fakes is based on traditional cybersecurity best practices: secure all stages in the pipeline and enable strong encryption and monitoring tools.",
