This allows us to get other plausible paths of the effect. We regard the mean of the mentioned 10000 trajectories as the profile under the shutdown. We also simulate from the estimated model where we set all change-point effects to 0. This allows us to mimic a load situation without the COVID-19 shutdowns. Again, the corresponding average describes the profile that we want to compare. Another interesting aspect is that the structural change due to the shutdown of the nonnecessary commercial business is quite smooth and requires a couple of days to settle at the corresponding load level. This suggests that after the mentioned shutdown some businesses were still running for a few days prior closing. First, let us note the overall decrease of the load in the shutdown scenario. An interesting effect is the flattened morning peak (around 8 am -12 am). This is most probably a result of many people working from home or not working at all and thus lesser utilization of production capacities, office building and electrified public transport etc. Interestingly, the evening peak in demand is preserved and currently it is clearly the most electricity consuming part of every day in the week. This is reasonable as because of the lockdown, more people are cooking at home or using electricity-based entertainment. Furthermore, the difference in electricity demand between Saturday and Sunday shrank heavily due to the shutdowns.",

This is best visible on Sundays: usually at 7 am the load level would increase by about 2.5GWh (\u2248 10% of the night load) from the night level. During the shutdown the increase starts later, at 7am we still remain at the night level load. A plausible explanation would be a 'getting up late'-effect. So the Italians tend to sleep longer during the lockdown period. Figure 5 presents the electricity demand in the other considered countries: Germany, France, Spain and Poland. The overall pattern of the rising deviation between the shutdown and no-shutdown models is similar to the one in Italy, but respectively delayed. However, the level of the deviation differs among the states, what was already depicted in Figure 1 .",

The reason may be that the limitations were announced accordingly earlier and the residents and companies of France may have started changing their public activity earlier, following the other countries' recommendations. Furthermore, even before the national lock-down all big events, football matches etc. were being cancelled. However, there might be interactions with the export of electricity (esp. to Italy) and temperature effects. Concerning the latter, the period from 21 March to 2 April was relatively cold in Europe, and France has a high temperature dependency in the electricity demand due to large electric heating capacities. Figure 6 shows the comparison of weekly demand over hours of the day between the shutdown and no-shutdown scenarios for Germany, France, Spain and Poland. Again, the plots are based on the week from 30 March to 6 April 2020. Similarly as in the Italian case, we observe an overall demand decrease for every country.

The difference between the shutdown and no-shutdown models only confirms that the undertaken measures have heavily impacted the electricity load in Italy. Nevertheless, the seasonal effect is also present what is depicted by the slow decrease of the demand level of the model assuming no change-points. Hence, the shutdown effect is smaller than the naive comparison with pre-shutdown demand suggests.",
