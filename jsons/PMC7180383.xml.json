There is a requirement for the introduction of various advance technologies to tackle various problems related to this viral pandemic. Industry 4.0 is also known as the fourth industrial revolution, which consists of advance manufacturing and information technologies, to fulfil the customised requirement of different areas of the human being in lesser time. These technologies provide wireless connectivity in the manufacturing and service sector to enhance automation. In the fully implemented scenario of Industry 4.0, we see all these technologies are connected, and medical stakeholders communicate with each other for manufacturing and use of the vaccine, healthcare equipment & logistics, checkup, surveillance, detection and deciding necessary actions with lesser human physical involvement. The proper updates on the gathering of people are provided by the data captured by the advance technologies [1,2].",

It can be used to centralize all medical tools, devices and treatment process. In future, the medical industry would grow and has to adapt to digital technologies to create smart healthcare system and hence there is a need to change the software platform software devices to the latest ones.

Digital technologies provide an innovative method for the proper isolation of the infected patient to reduce the high risk of mortality, speeding up the drug manufacturing, treatment process and care. By the application of these technologies, people are working from home; they are discovering a new office culture, work timings, virtual offices, virtual meetings, and extensive written communications. Industry 4.0 has the capability of remote operation using smart technologies which is helpful for COVID- 19 outbreak. This revolution speeds up the digital transformation with better crowd management, transportation management and safety of the public. These digital technologies create virtual clinic through the application of telemedicine consultations. So, there will be a reduction in physical crowding of the patients in the hospitals and clinics. These technologies track the record of the patient and prevent the patient from unnecessary hospital consultations.",
