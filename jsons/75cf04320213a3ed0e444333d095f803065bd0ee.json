An electronic search was executed employing the keywords 3 \"cardiovascular\" OR \"cardiac\" OR \"heart\" AND \"coronavirus 2019\" OR \"COVID-19\" OR 4 \"SARS-CoV-2\", between 2019 and May 4, 2020. No language restrictions were applied. The 5 title, abstract and full text of all articles captured with these search criteria were assessed. 6 Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook) were also consulted. 7 In such times, methodologically-sound research on COVID-19 and its cardiovascular 8 manifestations is hampered by numerous challenges. These include SARS-CoV-2 test 9 availability and accuracy, the decision of healthcare authorities not to screen for infection 10 certain groups (which could lead to underestimation of the pandemic burden), heterogeneous 11 reporting across countries, as well as the fact that estimates of the exact incidence of specific 12 COVID-19 complications and prevalence of baseline comorbidities are often being carried out 13 in a suboptimal fashion (e.g., small single-center cohorts, isolated reports on social media, 14 etc). For all these limitations, a high degree of caution and criticism should be adopted to 15 identify selective reporting and biased data, and when drawing conclusions based on small 16 case series or anecdotal case reports.

However, to understand the full epidemic 23 potential of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to take into consideration the high fraction (up to 24 86% of cases) of undocumented infections (asymptomatic or mild symptoms) that remains 1 unrecognized and could expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus [9] . The 2 case fatality rate of COVID-19 widely varies across countries, ranging from 0.3% to 3 7.2% [10, 11] . 14 It has been speculated that some drugs could increase susceptibility to developing 15 severe forms of COVID-19. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, receiving ARB 16 or ACEI have an upregulation of ACE2, which would be therefore available in great amounts 17 to offer a binding site for SARS-CoV-2[3,4,24]. However, this concern, derived from in-vitro 18 and animal studies, has not found confirmation in clinical practice [24] . Indeed, in a large One possible mechanism of acute myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection 23 could be its affinity to ACE2, which is widely expressed in the heart, and cause direct 24 myocardial injury [5, 17] . Other proposed pathways include a cytokine storm triggered by an 1 imbalanced response by type 1 and type 2 T-helper cells[5], sympathetic hyperactivity, 2 anemia and hypoxemic myocardial cells damage due to respiratory dysfunction (type 2 MI). In a small meta-analysis (4 studies, 341 patients), standardized mean differences of 10 cardiac troponin I levels were significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19-related 11 symptoms compared to those with non-severe presentation [28] . Myocardial injury, present in 12 19.7% of COVID-19 patients, was associated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, 13 more severe pulmonary involvement, higher need for non-invasive and invasive ventilation, In a series reporting on 68 deaths in a cohort of 150 COVID-19 patients, 7% were 23 attributed to myocarditis with hemodynamic collapse, while in 33% of cases myocarditis 24 could have played a contributing role to patient death [31] . Although the clinical picture is still 1 referred to as a \"myocarditis\" in many instances, myocardial infection by SARS-CoV-2 was 2 not proven in most cases with COVID-19 myocardial involvement. To date, only isolated case 3 reports provided data on the pathology of the myocardial tissue from COVID-19 patients, ",

Moreover, AI is particularly suited for massive analysis of imaging data, which 10 at the moment has been taken advantage of for COVID-19 pneumonitis diagnosis[85] but is 11 also potentially suitable for cardiac applications, such as automated interpretation of 12 electrocardiograms, imaging, and pathology specimens.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed 7 diffuse myocardial edema on the basal and mid left ventricular segments, with no detectable 8 scar. Endomyocardial biopsy documented diffuse T-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates and 9 huge interstitial edema without any other substantial damage.

Although the clinical presentation suggested severe 13 and necrotizing acute myocarditis, the pathology report demonstrated only low-grade 14 myocardial inflammation and absence of myocyte necrosis[33]. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 15 was only demonstrated in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings, while no 16 viral particle was found in cardiac myocytes, which showed non-specific damage (mainly 17 focal myofibrillar lysis)[33]. Either transient viremia or infected macrophage migration from 18 the lung might occur in COVID-19 patients with non-acute myocardial involvement.

Notably, it was associated with worse prognosis as it was almost 5 times 18 more common in patients who did not survive the hospitalization (51.9% vs. 11.7%)[46]. 19 Similar to troponin, elevation of B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP/NT-proBNP) is associated 20 with an unfavorable course among patients with ARDS[31]. 21 In the setting of COVID-19, heart failure could be attributable to either the 22 exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular disease or the new onset of cardiomyopathy 23 (particularly myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy). Isolated right heart failure can be 24 observed in presence of pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe ARDS anddiastolic dysfunction. Thus, these patients may be prone to develop 4 pulmonary edema when they are given copious amounts of intravenous fluids to maintain 5 blood pressure or as a vehicle for parenteral drug infusion[24]. However, pulmonary edema as 6 observed in the setting of COVID-19 could also represent the manifestation of a pulmonary 7 vascular injury, which might be direct or mediated by the excess of local angiotensin-2, 8 inducing severe vasoconstriction and microvascular dysfunction, and activating inflammation 9 process[24].",

The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology 2 instead recommends primary PCI in low COVID-19 probability in the absence of major 3 logistic restrictions, while fibrinolysis could be considered in moderate/high probability or 4 COVID-19 positive STEMI patients, particularly in the presence of staff/resource 5 limitations[65]. PCI in catheterization laboratories with aerosol-level PPE should also be 6 considered in case of fibrinolysis contraindication or failure or in cases with cardiogenic 7 shock due to ACS[65]. Even in case of successful initial fibrinolysis, planned PCI should be 8 performed within 24 hours[65]. 9 For non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) patients, medical therapy should be initially 10 pursued. Revascularization should be considered in case of refractory chest pain, malignant 11 arrhythmia and hemodynamic instability, with rapid discharge following 12 revascularization[62,63,65].13 Efforts should be made to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 MI, and other causes 14 of troponin rise[62,63,65]. Diagnostic and interventional procedures should be deferred in 15 patients with type 2 MI, myocardial injury, and patients with suspected myocarditis without 16 cardiogenic shock. Coronary computed tomography angiography, performed at the time of 17 lung evaluation in cases with severe respiratory involvement, might be useful to rule out 18 coronary artery disease. 19 Routine elective cardiac surgery procedures should be rescheduled, while patients at 20 high risk for short-term adverse cardiac events should still be offered surgical treatment[4,66]. 21 Given ICU bed shortages and the risk for in-hospital contagion, medical management as a 22 bridge to intervention after the pandemic should also be considered in selected individuals. 23 The Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons have issued detailed recommendations regarding 24 elective and emergency procedures[66].25As the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic starts to slowly abate in untreated cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of adverse outcomes and 4 efforts should be made to reestablish prior pathways of care while simultaneously minimizing 5 the risk of COVID-19 resurgence.",

The urgent need for a safe and effective treatment can also lead to less rigor and 15 respect of essential research standards as well as relaxed data generation and interpretation,16 which can have undesirable downstream impact[72]. 17 At least 30 clinical trials are currently being conducted to test the efficacy and safety 18 of COVID-19 therapies. Broadly speaking, there are three therapeutic approaches 19 (Supplementary Figure S1): i) antiviral drugs; ii) immune response modulators; and iii) 20 RAAS blockers[73]. A list of the currently investigated drugs, their cardiovascular side 21 effects and potential interactions with cardiovascular medication are detailed in 22 Supplementary Table S1. In this section we will exclusively focus on the cardiovascular side 23 effects and drug interactions of commonly used anti-COVID-19 medications. particularly true with lopinavir-ritonavir (protease inhibitors). Ritonavir is a potent 3 inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP3A). It can increase plasma concentration of class IA and 4 III antiarrhythmics, potentially triggering severe ventricular arrhythmias through QTc 5 prolongation[74]. Similarly, clopidogrel active metabolite concentrations can be reduced, 6 requiring platelet function monitoring to avoid excessive thrombotic risk or switching to 7 prasugrel. Conversely, ticagrelor concentration increases with CYP3A inhibition. With regard 8 to anticoagulants, most direct Xa and IIa inhibitors are also metabolized by CYP3A, and thus 9 there is a potential increase in bleeding risk with ritonavir[75,76]. Besides interactions, 10 lopinavir-ritonavir association can directly cause hypotension and atrioventricular conduction 11 disturbances. 12 Favipiravir is a novel antiviral drug which directly inhibits RNA-dependent-RNA-13 polymerase. It can prolong the QTc interval, increasing the risk for malignant ventricular and hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) are well known to prolong the QTc 18 interval, which is particularly concerning in COVID-19 patients[45]. These subjects are often 19 hospitalized in critical conditions, and, consequently, predisposed to electrolyte derangements 20 (e.g., hypokalemia), which can act synergistically with CQ/HCQ to prolong the QTc interval, 21 thus triggering ventricular arrhythmias (torsade de pointes). Hypotension and atrioventricular 22 conduction disturbances have also been reported with CQ/HCQ.23 Azithromycin is an antibiotic of the macrolide family. Like CQ/HCQ, azithromycin 24 prolongs the QTc interval. Hence, the frequent association of CQ/HCQ and azithromycin used 25 in COVID-19 patients could increase the risk of torsade de pointes and Methylprednisolone and corticosteroids in general can increase blood pressure and 5 increase fluid retention. They have also been associated with supra-therapeutic INR values of 6 patients on warfarin[80].",

A large study from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that among 72,314 COVID-19 patients, 81.4% had mild symptoms, while severe and critical presentations were only observed in 13.9% and 4.7% of cases, respectively[17]. Mild presentations generally consist of symptoms common to other viral infections (\"the flu-like syndrome\")[17]. Anosmia and/or dysgeusia have also been reported, particularly in mild presentations[18]. Severe COVID-19 may present as pneumonia, ARDS, with or without distributive and cardiogenic shock[17].CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND COVID-19: VULNERABILITY OF PATIENTSWITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASEACE2 represents a key counter regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis[3]. After the initial engagement of ACE2 by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, there is subsequent down-regulation of ACE2, leading to a reduction of angiotensin-(1-7)[3], which triggers acute lung damage. Importantly, this injury can be attenuated in animal models by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway with 18 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers19 (ARB)[19]. Patients with underlying heart disease are among the highest-risk individuals for developing severe forms of the disease, including death[5,17,20,21]. A meta-analysis including 1,527 Chinese patients with COVID-19, reported the following prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease: 17.1%, 9.7% and 16.4%, respectively[21]. Comorbidity burden has been associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection and the need for ICU admission[21]. While overall case fatality rate among 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan was 2.3%, higher rates were observed in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6%)[17]. Data from Italy confirmed increased mortality rates in patients with comorbidities, particularly the older adults with pre-existent cardiovascular conditions[22]. Patients with cardiovascular disease are generally older adults. Aging-related immunological quiescence may predispose to higher attack rates in the older adults[23].",
