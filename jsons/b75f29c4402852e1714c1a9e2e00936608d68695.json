While guidance suggests that primary care physicians must rely on their clinical judgement for evaluation of those cases, there has been no risk stratifying tool that has been reported or validated in this cohort of patients. This reflection note reviews current guidance, identifies gaps in our knowledge and clinical practice and finally provides a rationale for research in this cohort of patients. We propose a research design with detailed descriptions of variables that would be feasible to examine in primary care settings. Primary care research in the characteristics and the outcomes of suspected cases of COVID-19 may provide a different view on the COVID-19 epidemic. We hypothesise that most of the patients with suspected diagnosis and home isolation will have good outcomes. Reporting on the characteristics and the outcomes in this cohort of patients may provide hope to patients and to the international community that receives daily updates on confirmed cases and mortality rates but none on the recovery counts.",

The term 'Probable case' recently expanded to include a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. 'Confirmed cases' is a term that is reserved only for those with laboratory confirmation irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. 2 At the start, WHO advised screen and triage, all suspected cases who had mild symptoms had a COVID-19 PCR test. 3 Patients with positive results were advised quarantine in either home or quarantine facilities dependant on local guidance. Later with the strain on resources, guidance was updated. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and many countries updated guidance to advise home isolation with no testing for suspected cases with mild symptoms. Testing for COVID-19 virus is now reserved for severe presentation or high-risk population dependant on the local guidelines.",

False-negative results are not uncommon and may be missing on as much as 30%-35% of cases. Causes of false negative include low viral load early in the disease, issues with sample collection and issues with handling and shipping. 20 The much-needed research is required to provide further insights into the scale of the epidemic; outcomes in those patients we advise to home isolate as suspects are not reported to date. We hypothesise that admission and mortality rate in those group of patients is low. The data may provide hope to those we sent home with suspected or probable diagnosis and more importantly to the international community that receives daily updates on confirmed cases and mortality rates but very minimal on the recovery counts. The study results, if proves to have a positive outcome, should not be confused with the definite recovery rates of COVID-19 and should not be used to advise the patient not to stay at home but rather to instil hope into higher rates of recovery and low rates of admission in population with mild symptoms at the time of the epidemic.",
