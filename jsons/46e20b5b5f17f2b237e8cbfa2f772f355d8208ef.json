            "text": "antibody functions, and the rapidity of this primary response, have been shown to play a vital role in protection from extracellular bacterial pathogens [ 3 ] . Antibodies afford protection against viral infection by neutralizing the virus particles; binding and blocking key molecules involved in cellular infection. Similarly they can also neutralize toxins. Later maturation of the B-cells in the immune response is slower but results in the generation of more highly specific antibodies, which may be of a different isotype, following a process known as affinity maturation. In addition to the neutralizing and opsonizing functions of antibody, B-cells are also important as modulators of inflammation [ 4 , 5 ] , regulators of the immune response [ 6 ] and as antigen presenting cells and activators of T-cells [ 7 -10 ] . for it's antigen as the selection criteria. Diversity is generated by a process of gene rearrangement early on in the development of the cell, in the bone marrow prior to antigen encounter. The selection processes are twofold. Firstly B-cells are selected for survival, or not, on the basis of their antibody recognition-to eliminate inappropriate self-reactivity and encourage reactivity with foreign pathogens. Secondly there is a mutation step in development, and the resultant B-cells carrying improved antibodies are selected-this occurs in the germinal centre of secondary tissues, after encounter with antigen, and serves to increase the affinity of the antibody for the relevant antigen. Both generation of diversity and selection of antibody are complex processes that are crucial for an effective humoral immune system. A clear understanding of these processes, and how they are affected with age, is needed in order to comprehend the etiology of age-related inflammatory and infectious disease The elderly are susceptible to infections by a wide variety of pathogens, all of which involve B-cells and antibodies in the normal course of the immune response ( Table 1 ) . The lungs are, in common with other mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal and genito-urinary tracts, particularly vulnerable to infection by virtue of their exposure to the environment. As is illustrated in Table 1 , pulmonary infections are common in older people. The elderly are usually the first to be affected by annual epidemics of respiratory infections, and frequently suffer the worst clinically. Mortality figures attributable to influenza and pneumonia are confused by the fact that influenza is very often followed by a secondary infection-most notably by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Some would argue that this confounding factor results in a two to threefold underestimate of influenza mortality [ 23 ] . It is also argued that mortality due to influenza is negligible and it is the secondary bacterial infection that causes almost all deaths [ 24 , 25 ] . Whichever way round, it is generally agreed that older people are the worst affected by these diseases. It has been reported that 90% of all pneumonia and influenza deaths and 88% of respiratory syncytial virusassociated deaths occur in those aged over 65 years [ 26 ] . In the oldest old (85 years and over) there was a 32-fold increased chance of mortality from influenza or influenza-associated pneumonia compared with those aged 65-69 years [ 26 ] . According to the Department of Health, in the UK there are more than 18,000 hospitalizations resulting from pneumococcal pneumonia each year in those aged 65 years and over [ 27 ] . There is also an increased incidence of pneumococcal septicemia in old people associated with S. pneumoniae infection [ 28 ] . Antibody alone not hugely effective, but effective in the presence of complement [22] It is known that specific antibodies, generated during a T-dependent B-cell response, are crucial for protection against influenza. Ineffective influenza-specific antibody, as assessed by the Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, is associated with lowered protection from the disease [ 29 ] . Studies have shown that 25% or more of the elderly fail to develop HI titres of a protective level following vaccination [ 30 , 31 ] . In vivo studies in mice have shown that higher levels of B-cells and IgG2a antibody confer increased levels of protection [ 32 ] . It has been said that an age-related decrease in influenza protection can be solely accounted for by the reduced T-cell help available in the diminished elderly T-cell repertoire. However, this does not take into account the fact that the CD4+ T-cells themselves may rely on fully functioning B-cells for their activation [ 7 , 10 ] .",

Pneumonia is a bacterial infection, caused by a number of different organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae [ 33 ] , Staphylococcus aureus [ 34 ] , Streptococcus pyogenes [ 35 ] ) although S. pneumoniae is the major cause [ 33 ] . Immunity against S. pneumoniae is particularly reliant on a healthy B-cell population. This is because the antigenic portion of S. pneumoniae is a capsular polysaccharide and a T-independent type II (TI-II) antigen. Unlike a T-dependent B-cell response, where the maturation of the B-cell antibody relies on T-cell help and therefore any failure to respond could be attributed to a failure of T-cells, the TI-II response is independent of direct T-cell help. Therefore a failure to protect against S. pneumoniae is more likely to be a failure ascribable to deficits in the B-cells themselves.",

However, older people appear to have a fully functioning splenic marginal zone [ 36 ] so the lack of effective pneumococcal protection in the elderly still remains a mystery. One good candidate for further study is the IgM response. It has been shown, in mice, that the classical complement pathway, partially mediated by binding of natural IgM to bacteria, is vital for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae [ 3 ] . Human studies have also shown that antibody of the IgM isotype is vital in providing efficient protection against S. pneumoniae [ 37 ] , although this has been mainly attributed to \"IgM memory,\" with mutated IgM genes. The exact roles and relationships between natural antibody, IgM memory and class switched memory in the pneumococcal response remain to be determined.",

During one study on influenza vaccine it was discovered that an age-related decrease in specific antibody was accompanied by an increase in antibodies against double stranded DNA-indicative of self reactive/polyclonal Bcells [ 51 ] . Polyclonal B-cells are often associated with naive B-cells that have not been through the affinity maturation process and are reacting in either a low-affinity manner to specific antigen, or in a non-specific manner by virtue of their innate pattern recognition responses. It was this finding that led to the idea that perhaps humoral immunity in the older person was better represented by the T-independent response. However, as mentioned above, there is a large T-independent component to immune protection against S. pneumoniae and general protection is decreased with age. Crossreactive antibodies certainly appear to be increased in older people treated with the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine [ 52 ] , although the failure of the vaccine to adequately protect against pneumonia [ 53 -57 ] implies that they are not adequate compensation for the reduction in specific antibody that is also seen [ 52 ] .",

One of the most common autoantibody types, frequently associated with disease, is antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). These have consistently been found to be increased in the old (over 65) in the absence of disease; a prospective study showed persistence of these raised levels throughout older life [ 58 ] . The significance of this increase has not yet been determined, and attempts to relate these antibodies with general levels of disease and frailty have shown no associations. The Swedish longitudinal NONA immune study [ 59 ] showed significantly higher ANA levels in the oldest old (86-95 years) but found there to be no association nor any correlation to other immune risk factors (e.g. CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, CMV seropositivity). These findings are echoed by a Finnish study, where ANA positivity at the age of 90 did not show any correlation with survival, or with the levels of serum markers of inflammation [ 60 ] . It has even been suggested that an increase in ANA antibodies may have beneficial effects by virtue of a possible anti-tumor activity [ 61 ] .",

There has been a decline in incidence of the disease that has been observed over the last 40 years [ 66 ] which has been attributed to environmental factors. One possible contributor to this is the gradual decrease in the number of smokers. Recent evidence has shown that the presence of another auto-antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) is associated with smoking and a higher risk of RA [ 67 ] . The successful use of therapies such as Rituximab, which utilize an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to ablate peripheral B-cells, is ample evidence that B-cells play an important part in the disease process of RA [ 68 ] . In addition to the obvious mechanism of depleting auto-antibody producing cells, there is increasing evidence for a role of B-cells in RA as antigen-presenting cells, activating T-cells, and producing and responding to cytokines [ 69 ] . A further complication in understanding the role of B-cells is the fact that B-cells have recently been shown to be capable of immunosuppression-including in animals models of arthritis [ 70 , 71 ] .",

The FDCs are the stromal cells of the GC and play a key role in regulating the humoral immune respone [ 89 ] . Unlike antigen presenting cells (APCs), FDCs present intact antigen-antibody complexes on their cell surface [ 88 ] , in the form of immune complexes which are highly immunogenic, and assist GC B-cell proliferation [ 90 -92 ] . Proliferating GC B-cells are known as centroblasts. During centroblast proliferation, in the dark zone of the GC, hypermutation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes encoding antibody occurs. The B-cells move into the light zone, as centrocytes, and will die through apoptosis unless they receive rescue signals conditional on efficient recognition of the antigen by the newly formed B-cell receptor. Rescue signals are provided by FDCs and T-cells [ 93 ] . The helper T-cells in the GC are a particular subset of CD4+ T-cells, expressing CD57. These cells have unique characteristics that have yet to be fully elucidated [ 94 ] . Since FDC and T-cell help is limiting there is competition between B-cells and therefore selection of those B-cells with the highest affinity for antigen occurs. The resulting B-cells can switch the class of their antibody, from IgM to IgG/IgA/IgE, and this also requires T-cell help. B-cells with high affinity antibody differentiate into either memory B-cells, to provide for an efficient recall response, or plasma cells to secrete antibody. We have addressed the possible age-related changes in the GC reaction in three main areas: proliferation of B-cells, hypermutation of the Ig genes, and selection of high-affinity, antigen-specific, antibodies.",

It has been shown that telomere length decreases with age in T-cells, and to a lesser extent in B-cells [ 96 , 97 ] . However, we do not believe that the proliferative capacity of B-cells in the GC is impaired in this way as a result of old age. Telomerase, the enzyme that elongates telomeres, is upregulated in the GC, being high in centroblasts and higher still in centrocytes. This results in B-cells leaving the GC for the periphery with substantially longer telomeres than when they first entered, up to 4 kb longer as determined by Southern blotting [ 98 ] .

The shape of the lineage tree can help indicate the degree of selection that has taken place.

Since a failure of adequate selection could result in the production of a population of cells with low affinity, such as is seen in the elderly, we investigated lineage trees from GC reactions in samples from patients of different ages for selection differences. We found a significant decrease in the degree of selection pressure acting on GC B-cells in the Peyer's patch of the gut (but not the spleen). These data were confirmed by further analysis of the distribution of mutations within the Ig gene. A high level of replacement mutations in the complementarity-determining areas of the gene (relative to the more conserved Framework areas, Fig. 2 ) is expected in a selected Ig gene, and is indeed seen in the younger Peyer's patch GC samples but not the old [ 114 , 115 ] .",

This occurred more often in the older samples and led us to postulate that B-cells which have previously been through the affinity maturation process might be being re-used in subsequent immune responses. If the starting population of B-cells has already been modified in response to a different antigen, then its ability to effectively change to accommodate a new antigen may be compromised. This could partially explain the compromized selection noted above. Naive B-cells are characterized by their IgD expression, and memory B-cells are characterized by having mutated Ig genes and expressing CD27 on their surface. It has been shown in mice that the older B-cell population is made up of a greater number of B-cells carrying mutated Ig genes-i.e. memory B-cells [ 123 ] . Observations of an increased number of CD27+ B-cells in humans concur with this [ 124 , 125 ] . A change in serum IgD, which may also reflect an increase in the proportion of IgD-, memory, B-cells, has also been noted [ 84 ] . It is now well established, in mice, that na\u00efve B-cell output into the periphery decreases with age [see p. 395 Scholz et al.] . There is, as yet, no evidence that human bone marrow B-cell output decreases with age, although it is known that children reconstitute B-cell function after bone marrow transplants more rapidly than adults do [ 126 ] . Therefore, if the overall number of B-cells is not drastically reduced, and there are less naive cells being produced, an increased proportion of memory B-cells is a logical conclusion [ 127 ] . Since B-cell memory appears to be maintained by proliferation [ 125 ] it is possible that proliferating memory B-cell clones make up for any shortfall in immunological space caused by lower naive B-cell input.

A diverse and functional repertoire of antibodies is essential to produce an effective humoral immune response. If the repertoire of B and plasma cells is reduced, then the ability to recognize foreign antigen is severely compromised. B-cell diversity and antibody specificity are defined during the early stages of B lymphocyte differentiation, where the Ig genes are formed. The remarkable way in which gene segment rearrangement forms a complete Ig gene from different segments ( Fig. 2 ) results in millions of different Bcells, each with a unique Ig sequence capable of producing antibody with distinctive specificity. Briefly, the Ig molecule consists of both heavy and light chains. There are three types of gene segments, variable (V), diversity (D, heavy chain only) and joining (J). The segments are randomly recombined to generate a V(D)J for the heavy chain ( Fig. 2 ) or VJ for the light chain. Thus a germline repertoire of just 165 different V,D or J genes can result in a possible 8,116 different gene rearrangements. Combination of the heavy and light chains results in a possible 2,643,840 combinations. The region where the junctions join together is further diversified by an incomplete joining process. Addition and deletion of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidy transferase (TdT) activity at these joints leads to junctional diversity. The VDJ joining region of the heavy chain, the CDR3 region, is so highly variable that it can be considered to be a fingerprint for that particular gene and the B-cell (and its progeny) that carries it.",

The studies vary in design (looking at specific gene families only, or at specific isotypes, or only in response to a particular challenge) which may account for some of the discrepancies between them. The earliest report is probably the most comprehensive in terms of VH repertoire, although limited in the number of different subjects used (five old and one young) [ 106 ] . They showed an increase in usage of certain IGHV genes, in particular of the IGHV4 family [ 106 ] . However, this has since been contradicted. In another sequencing-based study of the IGHV4 repertoire in elderly human tonsil Kolar et al. did not find any change [ 99 ] . The IGHV repertoire has also been analyzed, in a small group of individuals, using a family-specific PCR-based approach. This showed consistency in the IGHV repertoire between samples of the same individual at time points 10 years apart [ 107 ] . IGHV family specific studies alone may not pick up functionally significant differences in the repertoire. Although the IGHV3 family usage in response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination showed no overall difference between the elderly and young adults, there was a significant loss of focus in the elderly response as evidenced by a loss of oligoclonality [ 52 ] . Furthermore, in the same experiments, a difference in Ig light chain usage was observed [ 129 ] .",

This, being the most variable region of the gene and having importance in antigen binding, has traditionally been an area used to define monoclonality and oligoclonality in pathology [ 130 ] . However, due to the cumbersome nature of sequencing and identifying V-D-J regions, the numbers of patients studied have generally been low, or limited to particular subsets of genes. For example, one study by Xue et al. [ 131 ] looked at D and J CDR3 length 60 70 region usage as determined by sequencing and found no difference between younger and older samples. However, they had only seven young and seven old samples and only studied the CDR3 regions of IGHV5 family IgM genes. A more tractable method of looking at CDR3 diversity was also employed by them, using PCR to amplify all CDR3 regions and look at the spread of different sized fragments. This method of spectratyping has also been used in the analysis of T-cell repertoires [ 132 -134 ] and enables the study of a much greater number of samples. We performed B-cell spectratyping on samples from peripheral blood of 33 old and 24 young subjects. The old samples are from the Swedish NONA Immune Longitudinal Study [ 135 ] , from patients over 86 years of age. Preliminary data has shown that the B-cell repertoire is indeed restricted in a subgroup (approximately one third) of older people ( Fig. 4 ).",

It may indeed be true that a decreasing na\u00efve B-cell output in the face of homeostatic mechanisms to keep the total number of B-cells the same has resulted in the repertoire being increasingly made up of antigen-experienced expansions of cells. Alternatively there may be pathological monoclonal expansions of B-cells, such as are seen in leukemia or lymphoma. Usually, these are diagnosed conditions, and individuals with this sort of medical history are excluded from studies on B-cell diversity. However, it might be possible that a pre-clinical condition exists in some people. An increase in monoclonal expansions of B-cells, both of CD5+ and CD5-phenotype, has previously been reported in older people [ 136 ] . Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a predominant plasma-cell disorder [ 137 ] and has been shown to increase with age in both humans [ 137 , 138 ] and mouse [ 139 ] . It is characterized by an increase in presence of serum monoclonal Ig. MGUS is not found in young subjects, is prevalent in around 2% of over 50s and has been reported to vary in the elderly from 11% to 38% [ 138 , 140 ] . There is an association between MGUS and onset of multiple myeloma or related malignant condition with average risk assessed at about 1% per year [ 141 ] . Questions still remain as to what significance these populations have in the aging human. Obviously there is the possibility that MGUS accounts for some of the observed repertoire restriction with increasing age. However, our data does not suggest a high prevalence of such monoclonal expansions, and the restricted repertoires often have a more oligoclonal appearance.",

Many of the studies on B-cells in old age are carried out in mice and the data in humans is sadly lacking. Hopefully this situation will change in the future and maybe the advent of the use of B-cell depletion therapies for the treatment of autoimmune disease can help provide more human data on B-cell dynamics in individuals of different ages.",

These plasma cells are the end point in B-cell development, which is characterized by (a) generation of a huge diversity of different B-cells, each carrying a different antibody gene in the bone marrow and (b) selection processes using the affinity of the membrane-bound form of the antibody (the B-cell receptor)",
