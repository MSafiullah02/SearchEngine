            "text": "In December 2019, a rapid and widespread outbreak of a novel coronavirus designated COVID-19, emerged in the city of Wuhan, China [[1], [2], [3]]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance draft in January 2020, any traveler to Wuhan City in Hubei Province 2 weeks before the onset of the symptoms is suspected to be infected with COVID-19 [1,4]. Additionally, the WHO distributed interim guidance for laboratories that carry out the testing for the newly-emerged outbreak, as well as infection prevention and control guidance [5,6]. The COVID-19 pneumonia is suspected of having originated in a seafood market, with an unknown animal being responsible for the emergence of the novel virus [2]. There are now surveillance borders around the globe, attempting to prevent the spread of the new mysterious coronavirus [7]. Just two months ago, in mid-January, only 41 cases had been confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, leaving one person dead and 7 in critical care [8]. These numbers are continually increasing each day, and the number of confirmed cases at the time of this writing has now exceeded 258,000, with 11,268 confirmed deaths, mostly in China, Europe, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China confirmed human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak [8]. Ten days later, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), then COVID-19 is declared as a pandemic 40 days later by the WHO. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress [2].",

The SARS and MERS HCoVs are the most well-known and aggressive strains of coronaviruses, each causing approximately 800 deaths. According to the WHO, the mortality rates for SARS and MERS HCoV are 10% and 36%, respectively. [10,[12], [13], [14], [15]]. The next few months will reveal the mortality of the new virus; a nearly 4.1% mortality rate for a flanking viral spread may mean millions of deaths.",

A homology model for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was built using the Swiss Model web server [31]. We used the SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) as a template for building our model since it was the most sequelogous solved structure (97.08% sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. 6NUR is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved structure (cryo-electron microscopy) with 3.1 \u00c5 resolution, which was deposited in the protein data bank in 2019 [32]. Two web servers were used to examine the model: the MolProbity web server of Duke University, and the Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) [33,34]. Various types of software were used to judge the validity of the model, such as PROCHECK [35], Verify 3D [36], PROVE [37], and ERRAT [38], in addition to the Ramachandran plot of the MolProbity web server. After validation, the model was optimized (classical mechanical, using the MM3 force field) with assistance from the computational chemistry workspace SCIGRESS of Fujitsu [20,22,39,40]. Model minimization was performed after the addition of missed hydrogen atoms to prepare for the docking study [41].",

The active site residues (D255 and D256) are circled and marked in the MSA. As implied from the MSA, the active site is highly conserved and water accessible in all 7 strains of the human coronaviruses (the red highlighting indicates identical residues, while the yellow highlighting represents conserved residues).

A grid box (30 \u00c5 \u00d7 30 \u00c5 \u00d7 30 \u00c5) centered at (142, 139, 150) \u00c5, (141, 139, 149) \u00c5, and (11, 6, 13) \u00c5, for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, SARS RdRp, and HCV NS5B RdRp, respectively, was used in the docking experiments by utilizing the AutoDock tools [47]. Fig. 2\nshows the docking score values for the SARS-CoV-2 (blue columns), SARS HCoVs (orange columns), and HCV NS5B RdRps (gray columns). The physiological compounds (GTP, UTP, CTP, and ATP) exhibited binding energies for SARS-CoV-2 between \u22127 (ATP) and \u22128.7 (GTP) kcal/mol. The two negative control compounds (Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone) displayed low binding energies to all RdRps (\u22124.4 to \u22125.6 kcal/mol). The five approved drugs (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin) surrounded by the dashed-green box in Fig. 2 were also able to bind the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with binding energies of \u22127.0, \u22127.6, \u22126.9, \u22127.5, and \u22127.8 kcal/mol, respectively. These drugs were able to bind to the new coronavirus strain RdRp tightly and hence may contradict the polymerase function. In addition, these drugs are potential candidates for inhibiting the RdRps of HCV NS5B (\u22128.0 to \u22129.5 kcal/mol) and SARS (\u22126.2 to \u22127.1 kcal/mol). Other compounds that are currently in clinical trials can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with some showing promising results. Setrobuvir, IDX-184, and YAK (surrounded by red-dashed rectangles in Fig. 2) exhibit firm binding to all of the RdRps (\u22129.3, \u22129.0, and \u22128.4 kcal/mol, respectively for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp). The binding energy values against RdRp for these compounds are better than the native nucleotides. IDX-184 is a guanosine derivative, and it competes for GTP binding with slightly better binding (\u22129.0 kcal/mol) than GTP (\u22128.7 kcal/mol). Further analysis of the docking complexes is required to unravel their binding modes with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.",

On the other hand, both Setrobuvir and YAK formed H-bonds, hydrophobic contacts, \u03c0-cation contacts, and halogen interactions. Setrobuvir formed 3H-bonds (R444 (2) and K689), three hydrophobic contacts (D509, K689, and E702), a \u03c0-cation interaction with R444, and a halogen interaction with A653. YAK had 4H-bonds (R444, K512 (2), and K689), two hydrophobic contacts (K689 and E702), a \u03c0-cation interaction, and a halogen interaction with the same residues of Setrobuvir, as seen in Fig. 3(B).",

Moreover, the compounds IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK can tightly bind to the newly-emerged coronavirus RdRp, hence contradicting the function of the proteins leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 can be used as a seed for new compounds specific against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site. Further optimization of the compounds using the high-quality model of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp may result in a perfect compound able to stop the newly-emerged infection.",

The newly emerged coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is a health concern given that the last outbreaks of this type of virus (SARS and MERS) in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively, each left approximately 800 dead and thousands hospitalized. The present study attempted to test and suggest possible inhibitor drugs, either currently on the market or in clinical trials, to stop the infection immediately. Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir showed promising results for use against the newly emerged strain of coronavirus. Besides, the IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK compounds exhibited excellent results for binding SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We suggest utilizing GTP as a seed to obtain specific inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp using its high-quality model.",
