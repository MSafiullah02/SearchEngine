Britain and Canada fared generally better than the Euro Area and Japan since the end of the crisis, with growth rates comparable to those in the United States.

Trump also imposed a tariff of 25 percent on U.S. steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on U.S. aluminum imports from many nations. Trump also started a trade war with China by imposing a 25 percent tariff on nearly $370 billion of Chinese exports to the United States (which remained in place despite signing a \u201cPhase-One\u201d trade agreement with China in January 2020). This in retaliation for China's large scale and systematic stealing of U.S. intellectual property and in order to bring back some manufacturing to the United States and in the hope of reducing the huge and unsustainable U.S. trade deficit with China (White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, 2018).",

This started before the recent global financial crisis but it rapidly accelerated afterwards.
