            "text": "Acute respiratory infections in children are caused by a large panel of viruses and bacteria located in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. A viral etiology in children is most often suspected based on clinical signs and symptoms because laboratory investigation requires a biocontainment for the virus culture, qualified personnel, and expensive and time-consuming techniques, which provide late results with little impact on patient care (Brunstein and Thomas, 2006). Therefore, research for viral causes of acute respiratory infections is used rarely by clinicians. The recent development of molecular techniques and their advantage over cell culture, and the recent discovery of new viruses responsible of acute respiratory infections have increased the interest of clinical and molecular virology research laboratories for the study of viruses in clinical specimens (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Briese et al., 2005, Fox, 2007, Freymuth et al., 2006, Liolios et al., 2001, Vabret et al., 2000, Weinberg et al., 2004). The most common viruses responsible for acute respiratory infections are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRhV), human enterovirus (hEnV), influenza viruses A, B, and C (IAV, IBV, and ICV, respectively), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronaviruses (hCoV) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), and human bocavirus (hBoV). Several multiplex techniques developed so far have the capacity to identify the majority of these viruses in clinical samples (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Brunstein and Thomas, 2006, Coiras et al., 2004, Freymuth et al., 2006, Lam et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2007, Li et al., 2007, Mahony et al., 2007, Nolte et al., 2007, Pabbaraju et al., 2008, Syrmis et al., 2004, Templeton et al., 2004) to identify co-infections (Brunstein et al., 2008) and to discover incidentally uncharacterized genotypes (Lamson et al., 2006). The choice of one technique over the other should consider the rapidity, specificity, and sensitivity of the method, but also whether it requires equipment and commercial kits too costly for routine diagnostic laboratories. In order to address these questions, a 3-tube RT-PCR-based multiplex (mRT-PCR) initially described for 11 viruses (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005), and expanded with an additional tube of mRT-PCR targeting four other hCoVs (Vabret et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2008) was used for diagnostic purposes. The sensitivity of the technique was tested using quantified RNA transcript fragments from 14 targeted viruses, excluding SARS-CoV. A total of 91 clinical specimens from children with acute respiratory infections were tested and the results obtained in the 4-tube mRT-PCR were compared to those obtained with a 1-tube tagged-enriched Resplex II assay using Luminex technology (Brunstein and Thomas, 2006, Brunstein et al., 2008, Li et al., 2007) for 12 common respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV detection. The results show that mRT-PCR offers the advantage of broader application at a lower cost over the ResPlex II assay for routine diagnosis of acute respiratory infections, albeit the former is less performant for IVA detection and the latter less performant for detection of PIV1, 3, and 4.",

After incubation at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min and at 94 \u00b0C for 15 min, the reactions were subjected to 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s annealing at 55 \u00b0C, and 1 min extension at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The amplified products were analyzed in a 0.5 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide\u20132% agarose gel.",

The remaining four positive viruses by the mRT-PCR were probably false positive. Overall, the majority of viruses showing false negative or false positive results by the mRT-PCR were IAV and RSV, respectively, whereas hRhV, and PIV 1, 2, and 3 were the most misdiagnosed viruses by Resplex II. Co-infection was detected by the two assays in one patient, and co-infection was detected in two other patients only by the mRT-PCR (Table 4).",

Results are similar for sRT-PCR and WHO RT-PCR, show a lower sensitivity of mRT-PCR compared to sRT-PCR, and confirm a higher performance of Resplex II over mRT-PCR (Table 5\n). Performances of Resplex II and mRT-PCR were also compared using a series of limited dilutions of viruses (IBV, hEnV, and RSV) or of clinical samples (PIV1, PIV3, hRhV, and hMPV). Resplex II was more performant than mRT-PCR to detect hEnV and hMPV, and mRT-PCR was more performant than Resplex II to detect PIV1 and hRhV (Table 5).

In this study, two techniques of multiplex were compared to identify different viruses prevalent in children suffering from acute respiratory infections. The sensitivity of the technique is usually compared to virus titres in cell culture, but rarely on quantified viral RNA molecules (Brunstein and Thomas, 2006, Freymuth et al., 2006, Li et al., 2007). In contrast to commercial kits containing all reagents and controls validated by the manufacturers, the reproducibility and sensitivity of in-house techniques requires controls that can be used for periodic standardization and validation in external laboratories. The number of RNA molecules detected by the mRT-PCR for different viruses differs notably, suggesting that the hybridization temperature, amplification length, internal structures of the RNA transcript, and/or primer dimerization could specifically effect viral RNA amplification. The sRT-PCR usually showed higher sensitivity than mRT-PCR (Table 2, Table 5), supporting the last hypothesis. To increase the sensitivity of the mRT-PCR, a hemi-nested PCR was developed previously (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005), but this second step of PCR was not applied in this study because of possible cross-contamination. Despite this, sRT-PCR was performed for confirmation of positive mRT-PCR results and when different results were obtained from Resplex II assay. Sequencing of DNA products confirmed in the sRT-PCR and negative by the Resplex II assessed the specificity of the test and the absence of contamination since all amplified products showed at least one mutation present in three different clones, considered as hallmark of unique species.",

Only 68 samples of 91 (74.7%) showed concordant results with the mRT-PCR. The sensitivity reported by the supplier of Resplex II is about 500 viral genomes per reaction, a value in the order of that obtained by the mRT-PCR. The lack of detection of IVA by mRT-PCR in some clinical samples could be explained by the low amount of viral RNA in these samples and a higher performance of the Resplex II. This was confirmed by comparative analysis on serial dilution of H1N1 virus (Table 5). Our results suggest that the sRT-PCR for AIV should be added to the routine mRT-PCR. A real-time RT-PCR for IAV (Wang et al., 2009) was introduced recently in the panel of diagnosis of respiratory viruses. This technique confirmed the diagnosis of the 12 AIV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens detected in the present study by sRT-PCR and by Resplex II (data not shown). This test is now used in addition to the mRT-PCR diagnosis for seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and for avian H5 virus. Discrepant results between mRT-PCR and Resplex II on hMPV, hRhV and PIV were also confirmed by comparative analysis of serial dilutions of viruses or nasopharyngeal specimens. However, whether the discrepancies observed between the two techniques result from lower sensitivity or from lower specificity of primers and/or probes designed for each test is difficult to address since their specificity may show variability for different infecting virus genotypes.",

One drawback of the Resplex II assay is its high sensitivity which may produce potentially false positive data (Lee et al., 2007). Conversely, seven samples were negative by Resplex II, but were positive by mRT-PCR and sRT-PCR. Our test performed on archive specimens did not allow for control of the presence of these viruses in nasopharyngeal samples of children by cell culture. A previous study using Resplex II showed co-infections in numerous samples (Brunstein and Thomas, 2006). Both tests performed in nasopharyngeal samples detected only one co-infection by Resplex II and three by mRT-PCR. The discrepancy between the two molecular assays reflects the difficulty to compromise multiplexing and sensitivity of RT-PCR for the diagnosis of a multitude of viruses causing respiratory infection. Recent technologies using mass-tag-PCR or DNA microarrays are able to detect viruses in samples remaining negative by conventional methods (Dominguez et al., 2008, Lamson et al., 2006, Palacios et al., 2007, Quan et al., 2007), but like Resplex II, these techniques require expensive equipment not available in the majority of clinical laboratories. A comparative study between an individual in-house real-time PCR and the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel showed a correlation of 72\u2013100%, depending on the virus tested (Pabbaraju et al., 2008). The advantage of this new commercial kit based on Luminex technology over Resplex II is the number of viruses, including hCoV and AdV.",
