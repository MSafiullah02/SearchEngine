A review on available cross-sectional studies revealed an estimated 20% to 80% of upper respiratory tract infection among Hajj pilgrims, with influenza and rhinoviruses as the most common viral agent [29] . This is in line with findings from the above-mentioned studies on MERS-CoV in Hajj pilgrims: in the study by Benkouiten et al. [17] , the most commonly detected virus before, during and at the end of the Hajj was HRV in 5 of 165 (3.0%), 19 of 70 (27.1%) and 13 of 154 (8.4%), respectively. A significantly higher number of viral infections during and at the end of the Hajj were seen with 27 of 70 (38.6%) individuals positive for at least one respiratory virus during the Hajj and 17 of 154 (11.0%) pilgrims positive at the end of the Hajj compared to 8 of 165 (4.8%) pilgrims who were positive before their departure from France to KSA. [17] . This suggests a probable rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses among pilgrims during their stay. Benkouiten et al. [17] report the detection of FLU A during the Hajj in 6 of 70 (8.6%) pilgrims, but did not detect FLU A at the end of the Hajj. In contrast, we found 1.3% of pilgrims positive for FLU A upon return to Ghana. In contrast to our data, Benkouiten reported only a few RSV infections with a positive finding for RSV in only 1 of 70 (1.4%) pilgrim during the Hajj. Despite the slightly different sampling time point (upon departure in KSA and after return to Ghana), further reasons for the differences between studies may be the small number reported in the cohorts, with only 165, 70 and 154 pilgrims in the French study [17] versus our cohort of 839 individuals. The different ethnic and geographic background of the cohort and therefore a different pre-existing immunity may also account for the observed differences. There may also have been a difference between the seasons (2012 Hajj season versus 2013 Hajj season). Notably, in a follow-up study performed during the 2013 Hajj season, the same group reported a higher prevalence of influenza than previously found, with 10 of 129 pilgrims testing positive for influenza viral RNA (8 influenza A (H3N2), 1 for influenza A (H1N1), 1 for influenza B).
