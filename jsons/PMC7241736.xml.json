While identifying individuals infected with COVID-19 is relatively straightforward\nwhen symptoms are evident, identifying presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients is not and can\nbe a major undetected transmission route in spreading the virus. The median incubation period\nof COVID-19 with no apparent symptoms is 5.1 days,1 and the percentage of\ninfected individuals with asymptomatic infection is estimated to be between 18% and 31% of\ntotal infections.2,3\nEnvironmental surveillance for the presence of the virus in wastewater, known as\nwastewater-based epidemiology, could be an early warning tool and an effective approach for\nrapidly detecting COVID-19 outbreaks regardless of symptoms. Several studies have reported\ndetection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in feces.4,5 Recently, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage were reported in\nThe Netherlands6 and Australia.7 Importantly,\npresymptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients also had a viral load in feces as well as\nsymptomatic patients.4",

            "text": "The potential advantage of environmental surveillance in wastewater-based epidemiology is to\nenable prediction of the overall status of a given catchment area with much less effort than\nclinical surveillance. Environmental surveillance can provide a snapshot of the outbreak\nsituation in the entire catchment by testing a single wastewater sample, while clinical\nsurveillance needs a large number of samples which requires more time and cost for sample\ncollection and testing. Moreover, environmental surveillance can include people with\nasymptomatic and presymptomatic infections, who may not be included in clinical surveillance.\nSeveral studies have already proved that wastewater monitoring can detect outbreaks of\nnorovirus and poliovirus earlier than clinical surveys. According to Kazama et al., norovirus\nin sewage could be detected when gastroenteritis cases were as low as 0.1% of population\n(15\u201320 cases in 14 000 inhabitants).8 Norovirus in wastewater\nbegins to increase in the early stage of the increase of norovirus cases observed in clinical\nsurveillance. Since clinical surveillance often takes several weeks for data aggregation and\npublication, monitoring of norovirus in wastewater can detect the sign of outbreak earlier\nthan the clinical surveillance report. Medema et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected\nwith better sensitivity than norovirus in sewage.6 In their study,\nSARS-CoV-2 in wastewater was investigated in six locations by RT-qPCR assays using three\nprimer-probe sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. and 1\nprimer-probe set from European research groups. Positive signals were observed with three of\nthe four primer-probe sets when reported COVID-19 cases reached 5\u201310 cases per\n100 000 people. The published data are still inconclusive because one primer-probe set\nfrom CDC was negative. However, their study suggests that wastewater monitoring could be\nsensitive enough to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early stage of a COVID-19 outbreak.",

The median duration was 3 weeks in\nSARS-CoV-2 cases,5 whereas the median was 4 weeks in norovirus\ncases.9 In addition to viral load from symptomatic patients, wastewater\nreceives viruses shed from asymptomatically infected people. The viral load from asymptomatic\ninfection was reportedly similar to symptomatic patients in both SARS-CoV-2 and norovirus. The\nestimated ratio of asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of norovirus:\n18\u201332% of SARS-CoV-2 infection2,3 and 12\u201332% of norovirus infection. According to these data, the\nviral load of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is expected to be smaller than that of norovirus, which\nmeans that detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater could be more challenging than norovirus\ndepending on the sensitivity of the method being used.",
