Research question: Does binding of antivenom to venom persist after expiration date? Methods: Fluorescent immunoassays compared binding of antivenom to venom. Ninety-six well plates were coated with venom, incubated with antivenom, and then incubated with biotinylated anti-horse IgG. Streptavidin conjugated to \u03b2-galactosidase was added and hydrolysis of substrate generated fluorescence. Plates were analyzed using a fluorescent reader. Results: Faboterapico Polivalente Antivipmyn Tri antivenoms with expiration dates of 1/00, 3/09, and 10/10 bound Bothrops jararaca venom at respective rates of 95, 68, and 73 %, relative to unexpired control.

            "text": "prescribing of all opioids stratified by Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) schedule and provider level of training were analyzed. Prescribing trends for five common opioids (codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone) were individually explored. Visits were stratified into three categories by provider level of training: those that involved an attending only, a resident or midlevel provider (nurse practitioners, physician assistants). The proportion of visits for which each medication was prescribed was tabulated and trends were analyzed using surveyweighted logistic regression. Results: The weighted estimate of adult ED visits increased from 81,251,195 in 2001 to 100,027,879 in 2010 and the proportion of visits during which an opioid was prescribed by any provider increased from 10.0 to 19.0 %, p<0.001. Overall opioid prescribing increased for all visit types but was most pronounced in visits involving residents. Prescribing of schedule II agents increased more than schedule III-V agents for all groups (Table) . Hydromorphone use increased the most for all provider groups (433.4-529.9 %, p<0.001), followed by morphine (139.7-219.9 %, p<0.001) and oxycodone (94.7-142 .3 %, p<0.001). A variable effect was noted on codeine and hydrocodone prescribing among providers. Discussion: Opioid prescribing increased dramatically in the past decade in the ED, and visits involving residents had the greatest growth. Although attendings may influence resident prescribing, these trends could reflect increased emphasis on pain management in training programs. Other forces such as patient experience and accreditation requirements could be driving overall prescribing rates higher.",

It is also used as a rapid-acting antidepressant at doses and infusion rates lower than those for anesthesia. Hypothesis: Ketamine for treatment of depression may cause adverse psychosomatic effects, mental illness may confer greater risk. Methods: Three concurrent prospective studies enrolled patients in openlabel (unipolar depressives (UPs)) and placebo-controlled (UPs and bipolar depressives (BPs)) trials to receive single-dose ketamine 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 min. Serious medical conditions were exclusionary. No CNSactive agents were permitted for 18 days before infusion. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) were employed to measure symptoms. Fisher's exact test compared groups regarding SAEs. ANOVAs analyzed symptom data with repeated measures from baseline to 24 h post-infusion. Results: Forty-one patients (29 UPs, 12 BPs) and 50 controls were treated from September 2011 to September 2013. One UP experienced profound sedation with a Riker score of 2, she recovered fully within 2 h. Another UP suffered cocaine relapse 22 days post-infusion. One BP had severe vomiting. Four subjects (two UP, one BP, and one control) experienced acute psychiatric reactions (\"K-holes\") with varying degrees of anxiety, fear, violent ideation, dissociation, and aphasia-one UP failed to return to pre-infusion symptom intensity at 190 min post-infusion. Patients reported more anxiety than controls at baseline, it decreased following infusion. Dissociation, substantial in all groups, was greater in BPs vs. UPs vs. controls. On measures of agitation, grandiosity, delusions, and disorientation, patients did not differ from controls. Most measures peaked at infusion end or within 40 min. Increases in thought disorder, odd behavior, excitement, hallucinosis, and dissociation were greater in open-label vs. blinded subjects. History of substance abuse, PTSD, or trauma did not correlate with study measures. Baseline data did not predict SAEs. Discussion: Due to thought disorder and aphasia, some patients were unratable and most were symptomatic.",

            "text": "Major adverse reactions are more likely (p=0.043) in mood disorder patients, but not predicted by any demographic or clinical measure studied. Background: Calcium channel antagonist-induced shock remains a significant treatment challenge. Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, has a proposed mechanism of vasodilatation through increased nitric oxide (NO) production. Methylene blue (MB) inhibits NO production by inhibiting the activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase, thus may be useful to reverse hypotension associated with nifedipine toxicity. Methylene blue has not been studied as an antidote for nifedipine toxicity. Hypothesis: Methylene blue will improve survival following nifedipine intoxication in a swine model. Methods: This Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved study used 24 swine that were sedated with alpha-chloralose, mechanically ventilated, and instrumented for drug delivery and hemodynamic measures. After stabilization and basal measures, nifedipine (0.01875 mg/kg/min) was infused until toxicity, defined as a reduction in product of cardiac output and mean arterial pressure of 20 %, was reached. Animals received a bolus of 20 mL/kg 0.9 % normal saline once toxicity occurred immediately followed by equal volume amounts of either normal saline as a sham treatment, MB (1 mg/kg as a bolus and subsequent infusion), epinephrine (0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min), or MB and epinephrine. All treatments were continued for 5 h after the initiation of toxicity or until death occurred. Hemodynamics was monitored throughout the study. Surviving animals were euthanized. Survival data was analyzed using the Student's t test.",

There was no statistically significant change in survival in animals treated with MB, epinephrine, or MB plus epinephrine (Table) . Discussion: We observed no survival treatment effect with MB even in combination with epinephrine. Potential limitations of this experiment include: excessive severity of toxicity, insufficient dose of MB, untreated direct cardiac stress from prolonged compensatory tachycardia, and NO/ soluble guanylyl cyclase may play a minor role in nifedipine-induced hypotension.",

Within the toxic subset, an initial shockable rhythm was associated with greater survival rate (11/16) than a nonshockable rhythm (9/31; p=0.01). Discussion: Toxic patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia had similar survival and neurologic function compared to nontoxic causes. Limitations to our study include accuracy of assigning causality, incomplete confirmation of exposures, relatively small patient population, CPC scores extrapolated from medical records, and inability to control for potentially confounding co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: Toxin-associated cardiac arrests accounted for a significant proportion of patients in this study. Additional, larger studies may help to elucidate the optimal role for therapeutic hypothermia in toxin-induced cardiac arrest. Discussion: These data suggest that patients with anticholinergic toxicity are more likely to receive benzodiazepines than physostigmine (32.1 vs 13.1 %) as monotherapy, and a significant number of these patients did not receive treatment for their toxidrome. The use of physostigmine was not correlated with intubation rates or rhabdomyolysis though numbers were small. Conclusion: We find it interesting that physostigmine was infrequently used as treatment by toxicologists, given its recommendation for use in anticholinergic toxicity.",

Results: Three patients with accidental opioid exposure, an 8-month-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and a 28-year-old male heroin addict, were found comatose and with respiratory failure. Two had arrested prior to hospitalization. All had severe anoxic injury and deteriorated over 24-48 h becoming increasingly difficult to support. Formal brain-death exams in each demonstrated absent electrical activity on electroencephalogram, lack of response to ventilatory drive (PCO 2 , hypoxia) and absent brain stem reflexes; however, families were hesitant to allow organ procurement until they were reassured drug intoxication was not blunting response during the death exam. In each patient, a CPS demonstrated a lack of perfusion ultimately facilitating brain death diagnosis and organ donation. Discussion: The medical literature includes reports where various types of drug overdose mimicked brain death. State criteria for determining brain death typically include a formal neurologic exam, lack of patient response to ventilatory drive off sedation (i.e., 15 mmHg increases in PCO 2 ) and optional EEG. Additionally, in overdoses, it is suggested brain death not be diagnosed until toxic drug concentrations are absent. Determining drug concentrations however often take significant time potentially undermining continued stability compromising procurement of viable organs for transplantation in applicable cases.",

Two independent herpetologists confirmed the species to be C. cerastes by photo. The patient developed painful right-sided paresthesias and weakness progressing from the toes to the distal thigh. Physical exam 3 h after the bite revealed ecchymosis at the bite site, decreased sensation in the right foot, mild weakness of the leg, and pronounced fasciculations of the anterior thigh musculature. Fasciculations progressed to involuntary contractions of the large muscles of the thigh. Laboratory studies revealed normal platelets, protime, fibrinogen, CPK, and electrolytes throughout hospitalization. Antivenom was withheld based on unclear benefit for treatment of neurotoxicity. Over the next 48-72 h, symptoms progressed to include right arm, bilateral ptosis, and respiratory muscle weakness with three consecutive worsening negative inspiratory force measurements. Respiratory failure did not occur. He was anorexic and unable to walk independently. On day 5, he had improved enough to ambulate with a walker and was discharged. On 10-day follow-up, he reported continued but improved paresthesias, right-sided weakness, atypical chest pain, poor appetite, and new abdominal cramping. The patient was lost to follow up. Results: The patient developed prolonged neurotoxicity without hematotoxicity or significant local tissue injury. Discussion: C. cerastes has not previously been implicated in the development of neurotoxic venom effects. Conclusion: Neurotoxicity may develop following bites by the Sidewinder rattlesnake. It is unknown whether such effects would be prevented or reversed with antivenom. Methods: This is a single-patient chart review. A 57-year-old woman presented to a level 1 trauma center with a self-inflicted stab wound to her left chest. Imaging revealed a pneumothorax, which was treated with tube thoracostomy. Ten hours later, the patient became unresponsive. Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.4, PaCO 2 of 35, and PaO2 of 88 mmHg. The patient was intubated, and 10 min later became systolic. She was treated with chest compressions, epinephrine, and sodium bicarbonate, leading to ventricular tachycardia. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with defibrillation. Post arrest, venous blood gas revealed a pH of 7.18 and PaCO 2 of 73 mmHg. Labs sent at the time of the arrest were significant for a serum aspirin level of 100 mg/dL. Hemodialysis was indicated for treatment of the salicylate overdose; however, concerns arose regarding dialysis catheter placement and temperature maintenance during active cooling. After discussions with toxicology, hemodialysis was initiated. The patient improved and was discharged to inpatient psychiatry on hospital day 46. Results: The patient was actively cooled to goal temperature within 3 h of initiating the hypothermic protocol despite placement of the dialysis catheter and preparing to start hemodialysis. Background: Ondansetron, a centrally acting 5-HT3 receptor antagonist when used for preventing emesis, has a well-established safety profile. Large, pediatric symptomatic ingestions have not been well described. Hypothesis: Ondansetron-mediated 5-HT3 antagonism may cause severe toxicity in massive overdose.",

At the initial healthcare facility, the patient had emesis and worsening CNS depression, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heart rate was 152 and blood pressure was 138/87 (lowest at 80/38). EKG showed sinus tachycardia with QTC prolongation of 507 ms. Exam was significant for myoclonic jerks with unequal but reactive pupils. Laboratory evaluation and head CT scan were normal.

Ondansetron has a well-described safety profile with a large therapeutic margin. In the USA, ondansetron ODT is typically dispensed in blister packs. Because of hyperemesis gravidarum, the child's mother obtained a bottle of 60 ondansetron ODT without blister pack packaging from a foreign pharmacy. The ODT formulation has a flavoring agent in the tablet making them palatable to children. The mechanism of toxicity is uncertain but has been attributed to increase of synaptic serotonin concentrations as a result of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism and decreased receptor selectivity. Ondansetron may also be a weak antagonist of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and \u03b11-adrenergic receptors.",

In one patient, apparent drug-seeking behavior correlated with lack of change in EDA. Laterality seemed to be an important factor, as magnitude of response varied between dominant and nondominant wrists. Biometric changes should be further explored as a marker of opioid use in various clinical scenarios. Limitations: Larger application across varying ages, demographics, and range of opioid tolerance will be required to further delineate the expected biometric parameter changes. Conclusion: Changes in EDA occur with administration of opioids, may vary depending on opioid use history, and can be easily measured by portable biosensors. Introduction: Pregabalin, gabapentin and baclofen produce central nervous system effects by interaction with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or GABA receptors. There has been interest in internet discussion fora and in recent anecdotal reports to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) of pregabalin misuse. Baclofen is used in the treatment of GHB withdrawal and there are reports of users buying baclofen off the internet to self-treat withdrawal. There is no data on the prevalence of misuse of these drugs. The aim of this survey was to investigate misuse of these drugs in a clubbing cohort that have previously been shown to have a high prevalence of use of recreational drugs. Methods: We surveyed adults attending nightclubs catering for men who have sex with men (MSM) in South London in June 2013. Basic demographic data (age, sex, whether they had sex with men, women or both), together with data on whether individuals had heard of pregabalin, gabapentin and baclofen and if so, whether they had ever misused them were collected. Participants were classified MSM if they were male and had sex with men or both men and women. The results suggest that there is misuse of pregabalin, gabapentin and baclofen in a small, but significant proportion of this high drug-using MSM population. Further work is required to determine whether this is more widespread and to further understand the routes of supply and motivations for use so that appropriate preventive strategies can be implemented. Results: The patient was treated with brominodine, metoprolol, mannitol, solumedrol, and homatropine. Her IOP improved to 21 mmHg OS and 22 mmHg OD prior to discharge 24 h later. Discussion: Our patient experienced BAACG secondary to her use of oncedaily Qsymia, which contains 3.75 mg of phentermine and 23 mg of topiramate. While BAACG has been described in relation to topiramate in the ophthalmology literature, to our knowledge, it has not been described for Qysmia or in the toxicology literature. The mechanism of the development of BAACG from topiramate is hypothesized to be a uveal effusion leading to anterior displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm, resulting in miopization and reduction of anterior chamber depth. Phentermine has not been reported to cause BAACG. Our patient was instructed to discontinue the Qsymia.",

Of these, 12/22 (55 %) recommended an initial dose of 0.04 or 0.05 mg IV and 9/22 (41 %) suggested 0.4 or 0.5 mg IV. The maximum dose by titration recommended by source was 2 mg in six, 10 mg in eight, and 20 mg in two. No trend towards lower recommended dosage was noted based on year of publication (R 2 =0.012). An initial dosage less than 0.1 mg recommended by source was 3/4 MT, 3/4 anesthesia, 4/6 general medicine, and 2/4 EM. No IM or pediatric sources recommended an initial dose less than 0.4 mg. Discussion: Low-dose naloxone is highly effective in reversing ventilatory depression, and though it is slower in onset than higher doses, OWS is less concerning. The increase in chronic opioid therapy for pain and an increase prevalence of opioid abuse raises the likelihood of OWS following naloxone. Recent data suggests an initial naloxone dose of 0.04 mg IV is preferred. Lumex measurements in the patient's room were 2.6 \u03bcg/mm 3 . The patient used facial cream daily for 6 weeks and stopped 1 month prior to the first Hg level. Treatment included a full course of succimer. Hypertension was managed with diltiazem. Sleep and pain were managed with amitriptyline. Fasciculations, back pain, insomnia were present at 3 months. At 6 months follow-up, he had rejoined his soccer team but continued on diltiazem for persistent hypertension and tachycardia. Discussion: It is important to obtain a full medication history in adolescents using various acne treatments. Hg poisoning in pediatric patients is most commonly confused with pheochromocytoma and Kawasaki's disease. Patients presenting with similar symptoms yet an incomplete picture should prompt an evaluation for Hg poisoning. Conclusion: Determination of Hg toxicity may be challenging.

Methods: In case series analyses, internet searches identified poisonings and infections following consumption of raw plants and animals with poisonings confirmed by positive chromatography and infections defined by positive microscopic, serologic, or molecular diagnostics. Statistical significance was defined by p values \u22640.05 with continuous variables analyzed by t tests and categorical variables by chi-squares (\u03a7 2 ). Results: Thirty-eight cases of neuroangiostrongyliasis (NAS) with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis and 16 cases of paragonimiasis (PG) with hemorrhagic pneumonitis followed consumption of raw animals infected with causative parasites, rat lungworms (Angiostrongylus cantonensis), and American lung flukes (Paragonimus kellicotti), respectively. The mean age of NAS cases was 21.5 years, mostly males (P=0.039, \u03a7 2 ) from Hawaii (P=0.039, \u03a7 2 ) who consumed raw snails or frogs (P=0.003, \u03a7 2 ).

Six cases of plant poisonings were reported in five males with mean age of 26.4 years and one female (age 14). Four plant poisonings with three fatalities followed consumption of water hemlock (Cicuta maculata). Two fatalities followed consumption of poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). In fatal plant poisonings, hemlocks were misidentified as either wild carrot or ginseng. There were more infections then poisonings, but plant poisonings caused more fatalities than parasitic infections (P<0.0001, \u03a7 2 ). Discussion: Risk factors for infectious diseases from survivor copycat behaviors included male gender and consumption of raw animals while intoxicated outdoors. Risk factors for plant poisonings from survivor copycat behaviors included male gender and misidentification of poisonous plants as nonpoisonous. Recommended preventive interventions included proper preparation of self-harvested natural foods, wilderness survival training, and alcohol avoidance.

            "text": "Conclusion: This review of database information on adult patients presenting to a medical toxicologist for evaluation of heavy metal exposure finds that these patients are more often men referred by a primary care doctor or other outpatient physician. The most common exposures were cobalt, chromium, and mercury. Limitations include reliance on providers to enter information, resultant incomplete data entry, or potential reporting bias towards more unusual cases. Background: Acetaminophen overdose is a commonly reported overdose in the USA. There are multiple opioid-acetaminophen combination medications on the market. The percentage of people with acute liver failure associated with unintentional acetaminophen overdose is increasing. Patients may be unaware that acetaminophen is contained in certain prescription medications. Study objectives: Our study will assess if patients in the emergency department are aware that acetaminophen is contained in Percocet\u00ae. It will also evaluate if educating patients about their prescribed medication will increase their knowledge that Percocet contains acetaminophen. Materials and measure: We performed a prospective randomized study on patients ages 19 years and older, who presented to the Emergency Department Fast Track, and were being discharged with an outpatient prescription for Percocet (or its generic equivalent). Upon discharge, patients in both the control and intervention groups were given a questionnaire to complete. Prior to answering the questionnaire, the intervention group was read a script with information about Percocet and acetaminophen. A percentage of patients were contacted after their encounter for a repeat phone questionnaire.",

            "text": "Results: A total of 55 patients were enrolled. The intervention group answered significantly more correct questions than the control group. A majority of patients in the control group were unaware that Percocet contains acetaminophen. At a 4-month follow-up, patient scores in the intervention group decreased while those in the control group increased. Results: Five hundred fifty-seven patients were recorded as given naloxone during the study period. Sixty-eight (12.2 %) of the patients were 18 years and younger; of these, 14 (2.5 %) were <2 years, 17 (3.1 %) were 2-6 years, 4 (0.7 %) were 7-12 years, and 33 (5.7 %) were 13-18 years. The number of males were greater than females in all groups except the 7to 12-year group (males=females). For ages <2, 2-6, and 7-12 years, unintentional pharmacologic exposure was associated with receiving naloxone in 85.7, 88.2, and 50 % of cases, respectively. Patients of 13-18 years had 0.0 % unintentional pharmacologic exposures. Patients received naloxone for coma and/or respiratory depression in 78.6 % for the <2-year group, 76.5 % in the 2-to 6-year group, 100 % in the 7-to 12year group, and 60.6 % in the 13-to 18-year group. The proportion of xenobiotics associated with naloxone administration in each age group was calculated. The most common xenobiotics associated with naloxone administration were buprenorphine (17.7 %), oxycodone (13.2 %), and clonidine (11.8 %). Discussion: The prescription opioid abuse epidemic results in increased availability of opioids in the home. The ToxIC database shows that naloxone use in children is mostly due to unintentional pharmacologic exposures which support this. The most common xenobiotic implicated was buprenorphine.",

            "text": "Conclusion: According to the ToxIC database, the most common cause for naloxone administration in the pediatric population was unintentional pharmacologic exposure. , followed by unintentional pharmaceutical exposure (10 %), and withdrawal (9 %). The most common classes of agents consumed were non-opioid analgesics (31 %), sedativehypnotics/muscle relaxants (18 %), opioids (17 %), anticonvulsants (10 %), and antidepressants (10 %). Acetaminophen was ingested in 25 % of all cases. Thirty-seven percent of cases involved exposure to multiple drugs and 32 % involved exposure to more than one drug class. Seventy-nine patients (77 %) were symptomatic. Twenty-nine percent manifested a specific toxidrome, with sedative hypnotic being the most common (13 %), followed by toxidrome withdrawal (5 %), mostly from opioids. Central nervous system depression was present in 17 % of cases (71 % of whom involved sedative hypnotic/muscle relaxants). Tachycardia was present in 15 % of the cases; 6 % developed acetaminopheninduced hepatotoxicity. The most common antidotes administered were N-acetylcysteine (20 %), sodium bicarbonate (9 %), flumazenil (4 %), and physostigmine (4 %). All six patients with carbon monoxide therapy underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Twenty-three percent of women did not receive any treatment, despite the fact that 42 % of them were symptomatic. Discussion: Most pregnant women presenting to hospital with acute poisoning were engaged in self-harm or suicidal behavior, and the majority were symptomatic. As roughly half of untreated pregnant women were symptomatic, prospective studies should explore whether pregnant patients are treated less aggressively than their nonpregnant counterparts and pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: Most acute poisoning cases in pregnant women are intentional (self-harm) and symptomatic. Methods: This is a single-patient chart review of a 13-month-old female with no past medical history who presented to a hospital after ingesting Tylenol extra strength. The 4 h acetaminophen level was 343 \u03bcg/mL and she was started on IV NAC. Twelve hours later, she developed a tonicclonic seizure with sodium at that time measuring 124 mEq/l, a decrease from 142 mEq/l at the time of admission. She was treated with hypertonic saline, lorazepam, levetiracetam, and had no further seizures. A brain MRI and EEG were normal. Results: The EMR ordering system did not allow for volume adjustment of NAC for a young child. The NAC dose was correct; however, the diluent volume was a standard amount for an adult but not an 8 kg child, the first bag contained 150 mg/kg of NAC in 200 mL of D5W, the second contained 50 mg/kg in 500 mL of D5W, and the third contained 100 mg/kg in 1,000 mL of D5W (with total of 900 mL given at the time of seizure). Discussion: Because the 21-h IV NAC administration involves preparation of three different bags, an order set was developed to reduce ordering errors. With the exception of patient's weight, no other aspect of this order set was adjustable (including diluent choice or volume of preparation).",

Conclusions: Phenobarbital appears to be a safe and effective alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in noncritically ill patients and may be benzodiazepine sparing. She was started on CVVHD. An Impella\u00ae LD device and intravenous pacemaker were placed. MAP increased from 60 to 75 mmHg. EGD was done 16 h post-ingestion and revealed a large load of pill fragments (picture), which were suctioned and removed. Twenty hours after ingestion, her cardiac output decreased to only that provided by the Impella\u00ae device. Five days after admission, the Impella\u00ae device was weaned, but the patient was unable to be oxygenated and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for ARDS. ECMO was used for 2 days to support her oxygenation. Beta blockade effects appeared to resolve 5 days into her hospitalization. Vasopressors and mechanical ventilation were weaned by days 7 and 11, respectively. Full renal function and good recovery were complete in 30 days. Discussion: Atenolol is almost entirely renally excreted. We present levels demonstrating removal with CVVHD. This is the first case reported of using the Impella\u00ae device for this overdose. This is the first report of EGD decontamination of atenolol overdose. The large pill fragments burden found and removed from this patient at 16 h after ingestion is somewhat surprising. Methods: This is a consecutive-patient case series of five girls aged 7-11 transferred from an outside facility for specialty burn center evaluation. Symptoms developed 24 h after playing with limes and lemons near a backyard swimming pool. Results: The girls had skin findings of large flaccid bullae on an erythematous base over sun-exposed areas, not following any dermatomal distribution. Initially, parents were questioned regarding possible pool chemical exposure and abuse. Two girls required admission to the intensive care burn unit, one was admitted to the floor and two were discharged from the emergency department. Initial treatment for patients 1-3 included pain control with intravenous opioids, use of bacitracin ointment, and non-adherent Xeroform\u00ae and Adaptic\u00ae dressings. Clobetasol ointment was started on hospital day 2 on patients 1-3 and applied during dressing changes. Procedural sedation was required for dressing changes and debridement for patients 1, 2, and 3. Patients 4 and 5 were discharged home with bacitracin ointment and Xeroform\u00ae dressings. Following discharge, return visits were required for dressing changes in all five patients. Over the next 3 weeks, erythematous areas gradually became hyperpigmented. Plant specimens were identified by local botanists as Key Lime (Citrus aurantifolia) and Lisbon Lemon (Citrus limon). Discussion: Few phytophotodermatitis outbreaks demonstrate such severity in multiple pediatric patients, requiring transfer to a burn center for management. Optimal management of severe psoralen toxicity is not well established. In these cases, supportive care and topical steroids were used with good result. Oral steroids and silver impregnated dressings may also be considered. Conclusion: Psoralen phytophotodermatitis diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and may be initially misdiagnosed as herpes zoster, lymphangitis, chemical burns, poison oak, or jellyfish envenomation. Although potential abuse or pool chemical burns were considered in these cases, it became clear that the lesions were actually due to citrus exposure. Discussion: Over the past several years, URMC has evolved its TCS to a point where significant income is being generated through inpatient and outpatient consultation, as well as clinic visits. However, it should be noted that at our institution this work has been conducted by a single toxicologist who has committed significant time and effort towards success. Conclusion: A TCS can be supported financially with the appropriate support and structure. This service, when optimally operated can be of great benefit to patients, the community, as well as its associated medical center. Methods: This is a case series of incidents wherein laboratory workers were inappropriately exposed to a chemical hazard. The consultation logs of our academic toxicology service from April 8, 2008 to October 3, 2013 were reviewed to compile a list of these cases, which were then crossreferenced with our electronic medical record. We collected variables regarding the characteristics of each incident (e.g. the name of the chemical, the safety equipment used, and medical outcome on followup). These variables were then used to construct a Haddon matrix (Table 1) . Results: Six different cases were identified, routes of exposure ranged from inhalation to ocular. Time of exposure ranged from seconds to 60 min, symptoms ranged from irritation to chest discomfort. The majority took place without the use of PPE, although two incidents happened despite use of safety equipment. There were no known long-term sequelae of these exposures. Discussion: The utility of Haddon matrices is to analyze hazardous circumstances to determine prevention and mitigation strategies for future implementation. Examination of the Haddon matrices constructed from each of these cases yields common areas amenable to intervention: lack of personal protective equipment, improper storage conditions, lack of worker vigilance, improper spill containment/area clean-up, incongruous risk perception, incomplete adherence to existing safety practices, inadequate initial decontamination prior to ED arrival, and lack of witnesses during the exposure. Conclusion: This data will be used to improve education materials and instruction for students in laboratory research and to support a culture of safety and prevention in our university laboratories. \u2022 Improper spill containment resulting in potential future exposure \u2022 No oversight within office to monitor injury Mexico entered a total of 235 cases involving 43 agents. One hundred ninety-six (83 %) patients presented with clinical signs of toxicity, while 39 were asymptomatic. The most common clinical presentations were confusion, CNS and respiratory depression, agitation/delirium, or anticholinergic toxidrome. GI decontamination was performed on 44 patients: 37 received gastric lavage and 10 received activated charcoal. Medical treatments, given to 55 patients, were benzodiazepines (44 patients), antipsychotics (11 patients), atropine (7 patients), as well as NAC, calcium, glucose, vasopressors, high-dose insulin euglycemic therapy, and intralipid (1 to 4 patients for each). The most common intoxicants (and number of cases) were synthetic cathinones (42), ethanol (30), antipsychotics (20), sedatives (19), carbon monoxide (12), cannabinoids (12), acid/corrosives (11), and opioids/heroin (6). Conclusion: These initial data indicate that emerging drugs of abuse, prescription agents, and alcohol are well-represented intoxicants in urban toxicology practice settings worldwide. The increased use of gastric lavage over charcoal represents a trend which markedly differs from the USA and warrants further research. Our experience suggests that an international, web-based registry of bedside medical toxicology consultations is feasible. This project can create opportunities for global collaborative research and education among toxicologists with the ultimate goal of improving the care of poisoned patients worldwide.",

            "text": "Lapoint J Southern California Permanente Medical Group, San Diego, CA, USA Background: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is described as cyclical episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain associated with chronic and heavy cannabinoid use. The pathophysiology of CHS is poorly understood and published theories fail to explain the involvement of the endogenous cannabinoid system in the development of reported symptoms. Hypothesis: Topical capsaicin will improve symptoms associated with CHS. Methods: Prospective, nonblinded, nonplacebo-controlled trial of topical capsaicin preparation (0.075 %) in two patients with CHS. Case 1: A 19year-old female presents to the emergency department for the third time in 1 week complaining of nausea, vomiting, and severe generalized abdominal pain. She previously underwent negative CT of the abdomen and pelvis, negative transvaginal ultrasonography, negative pelvic exam, and with the exception of mild hypokalemia, negative laboratory values. Further history revealed the patient has frequent and heavy use of marijuana. Her pain completely resolved when placed in a hot shower in the emergency department. She was treated for hypokalemia and when her pain and nausea returned, a trial of topical capsaicin cream was initiated. Her pain decreased from 8/10 to 4/10 and she was subsequently discharged home. Case 2: A 28-year-old man with history of cyclical nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 years presents to the emergency department with return of his symptoms. His previous work up includes negative CT of abdomen and pelvis, negative EGD, and cholecystectomy. History revealed frequent and heavy marijuana smoking with improvement of symptoms upon exposure to hot water. A trial of topical capsaicin cream was initiated and the patient reported improvement in symptoms from 8/10 to 3/10. He was then discharged home. Discussion: Capsaicin's only known receptor, TRPV1, is known to interact with endocannabinoids and plays a role in pain transmission. The results here suggest TRPV1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of CHS as well as indicate a safe and convenient therapeutic option for these often challenging cases. Conclusion: Topical capsaicin therapy for CHS has potential as both a therapeutic modality and mechanistic probe that merits further investigation. The 34 cases were derived from 17 different institutions. Males accounted for 13/34 (38.2 %) of subjects. The median (IQR) age was 48 (34.5-56)years, with the youngest patient being 13 months. ILE was administered most often for nondyhydropyrine calcium channel blockers (n=9), followed by dihydropyridine-class calcium channel blockers (n=5), or the combination of a beta blocker and a calcium channel blocker (n=4). ILE was administered for beta blockers alone in five subjects. Local anesthetics accounted for only three cases of ILE administration. Various other medications accounted for the remaining cases. Bradycardia (HR<50 bpm) was observed in 11/34 (32.3 %), while hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) occurred in 29/34 (85.3 %). Three patients experienced a high-grade AV block prior to ILE administration. Six (17.6 %) patients experienced cardiac arrest prior to implementation of ILE. In total, 10/34 (29.4 %) patients died. Acute kidney injury (creatinine >2.0 mg/dL) was present in 7/34 (20.6 %), while metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2) was present in 14/34 (41.7 %) Conclusion: In this series of patients who received ILE, the majority of cases involved nonlocal anesthetics. Most patients were in shock and had evidence of abnormal tissue perfusion.",

Baclofen is occasionally necessary to continue during pregnancy due to preexisting neurological conditions. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) including seizures in a benzodiazepine-refractory case has been reported with baclofen and additional information regarding optimal treatment is needed. Hypothesis: The administration of a baclofen taper shortly after birth will help prevent NAS from intrauterine baclofen exposure. Methods: A single-patient chart review and review of the literature regarding baclofen exposure during pregnancy and NAS was performed. A 43year-old female with history of spasticity secondary to a spinal cord injury gave birth to a healthy full-term infant male via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Throughout pregnancy, the mother had received oral baclofen 80 mg daily. In order to mitigate NAS, a baclofen taper was planned after a multidisciplinary meeting. The initial dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day for 4 days, followed by a daily decrease of 0.01 mg/kg/day until discontinuation of the baclofen on the 13th day of life. Daily assessment for NAS was performed using the modified Finnegan NAS scoring system.",

The infant was discharged 3 days after the taper ended. Discussion: This study demonstrates the absence of NAS in an infant who received a baclofen taper after intrauterine baclofen exposure from a mother taking 80 mg/day. In addition to the taper, the baby received baclofen through breast milk as well. In fact, baclofen concentrations in milk ranged from 0.28 to 0.38 \u03bcg/mL which provided an additional approximate dose of 0.02 mg/kg/day (1/3 diet breast milk).

Baclofen may be used by pregnant and lactating patients but may cause serious toxicity in infants. Other than one case report, there is little data regarding distribution of baclofen into breast milk. Hypothesis: Nursing infants may be exposed to clinically significant amounts of baclofen when the mother is on oral baclofen. Methods: A single-patient chart review was conducted. A 43-year-old female with spasticity secondary to a spinal cord injury began supplying breast milk for her baby shortly after giving birth to a healthy full-term infant male. During and after pregnancy, the mother received oral baclofen, 20 mg QID at evenly spaced intervals, between 0600 and 2200 daily. For three consecutive days, breast milk samples were collected at estimated trough (0530) and peak (2400) times. Using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, baclofen concentrations were determined for each sample. Results: Baclofen mean trough levels were 0.297\u00b10.021 \u03bcg/mL and mean peak levels were 0.343\u00b10.033 \u03bcg/mL (Table 1) . Discussion: Our patient was taking 80 mg of oral baclofen (20 mg QID) daily and had breast milk concentrations ranging from 0.28 to 0.38 \u03bcg/mL. A 3 kg infant consuming 750 mL of breast milk per day would be ingesting approximately 0.075 mg/kg/day, approximately 1/4th the weight-based dose of baclofen (0.29 mg/kg/day) in an average 70 kg adult consuming 20 mg baclofen daily. Infants, however, may have longer elimination halflives and accumulate baclofen at greater concentrations. Infants may also be more sensitive to the effects of baclofen and exposure to lower amounts of baclofen over time could cause significant toxicity. In our infant-mother pair, the breast milk was initially limited to 1/3 amount of total daily diet (2/3 formula), only after observing for clinical effects and obtaining levels in milk did we increase the ratio to 50 %. Conclusion: This report adds to the data on baclofen distribution in breast milk. Nursing mothers may have to limit amount of breast milk intake as distribution may be significant. Background: Learning toxicology is an asynchronous process. Clinically severe or novel toxicities are infrequent. The expected breadth of knowledge in toxicology for emergency medicine (EM) residents is much larger than what is typically experienced during a residency. When medical toxicologists are available faculty, they are not ubiquitously available to reinforce salient learning points. In order to more uniformly teach toxicology, we used the social media platform Twitter to broaden our reach and accessibility. We attempt to measure the effectiveness of social media as a teaching tool among a select group of EM residents.",

These patients may be at risk for medical errors. Conclusion: Little information is available in the medical literature regarding adults with severe scorpion envenomation. This study suggests that this population may be at risk for significant morbidity. Over half would like to expand their toxicology practice but the majority perceives significant barriers to expansion. Conclusion: Full-time practice is unusual in MT. PCC work is common, but full-time compensation is not. Many MTs do not feel that they are fairly compensated. Research question: What is the prevalence of non-APAP containing xenobiotics associated with AST >1,000 seen by medical toxicologists? Methods: Using the search criteria \"AST >1,000\", all cases entered into the Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) database from May 1, 2012 to October 30, 2013 were reviewed. Four hundred sixty-two cases met these criteria. Two hundred sixty-three cases with an APAPcontaining xenobiotic as primary or secondary agent of exposure were excluded. Sixty-four cases where a xenobiotic was not specified, and another five cases that were deemed \"unlikely tox related\" were also excluded. Of the remaining 130 cases, there were 95 single-agent exposures and 35 multi-agent exposures. We limited our analysis to singleagent exposures for the prevalence of different xenobiotics and the clinical outcomes. Results: Ethanol was the primary xenobiotic in 52/95 (55 %) cases. Of these, 14 (27 %) developed metabolic acidosis (pH<7.2), 8 (15.3 %) developed hyperreflexia, myoclonus or clonus, 5 (9.6 %) developed acute kidney injury (AKI) (creatinine >2), and 3 (5.7 %) died. Opioids accounted for 9/95 (9 %) cases. AKI occurred in seven (78 %) opioid cases, rhabdomyolysis (CPK >1,000) in five (55 %), and death in two (22 %). Methamphetamine exposures comprised 7/95 (7 %) cases. Four (57 %) developed AKI and five (71 %) developed rhabdomyolysis. Mortality among this group was 14 %. Overall mortality among all single-agent non-APAP cases analyzed was 9 %. Other agents associated with death included rivaroxaban and valproic acid. Synthetic cathinones, carbamazepine, carisoprodol, acetazolamide, methimazole, risperidol, and black cohash were also associated with AST >1,000. Discussion: Ethanol was commonly associated with AST >1,000 in this series although this is not typical of ethanol-induced liver injury. The high prevalence AKI in the opioid and methamphetamine patients suggested development of multisystem failure. Prospective studies on patients with AST >1,000 would better characterize the mechanisms of these liver injuries.",

Results: Fifty-six mefloquine cases were identified. Fifty-two percent were male. The ages: 55 % were \u226520, 12.5 % were 6-9, and 30.4 % were 0-5. The most common symptoms were all gastrointestinal, nausea (10.7 %), diarrhea (8.9 %), and abdominal pain (7.1 %).

Among the nine cases, dizziness occurred in five, confusion in three, headache in two, agitation in two, and visual hallucinations in one. The number of tablets ingested ranged from 1 to 7. The duration of exposures ranged from a single one to the pills taken over 1 week. Medication dosing errors occurred in four of these nine cases because the patients took the medication daily instead of weekly. Discussion: While the most common AEs associated with mefloquine were gastrointestinal, the neuropsychiatric symptoms were more commonly reported than what we expected. Also, the symptoms included confusion and hallucinations. Headache, while present, was not very common.

            "text": "Simmons JC, Rushton WF, King JD, Charlton NP University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA Background: Serotonergic agents have become ubiquitous throughout medical care and include drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, select opioids (tramadol, fentanyl, and meperidine), antimicrobials (linezolid), over-the-counter preparations (dextromethorphan), lithium, and drugs of abuse (MDMA, LSD, cocaine, mushrooms). Despite the frequent prescribing pattern of serotonergic medications, medical students have often been unable to identify serotonergic medications during their medical toxicology rotation. The object of this study is to determine if senior medical students are cognizant of drugs that have high serotonergic activity and could potentiate serotonin syndrome. Methods: A clinical vignette regarding an adolescent male who daily takes an SSRI and who presented with fulminant serotonin syndrome after abusing dextromethorphan was distributed to a fourth year medical school class at one institution. Students were given a list of drugs commonly used in the ICU setting and asked to identify which were known to increase serotonergic activity and thus be avoided in the management of this patient. Response to the survey was entirely voluntary and two reminder emails were sent to increase responses. Results: One hundred twenty participants replied out of a class of 155 for a 77.4 % response rate. The following agents were correctly identified for their potential to increase serotonergic activity: 87.5 % sertraline, 50.8 % meperidine, 35.8 % linezolid, 18.3 % fentanyl, and 16.7 % lithium. The following agents were incorrectly identified as worsening serotonin syndrome: 45 % quetiapine, 12.5 % dexmedetomidine, 5 % propofol, 3.3 % midazolam, and 0 % cefepime. Discussion: Our results demonstrate significant gaps in understanding of serotonergic agents among fourth year medical students. While 87.5 % were able to identify that sertraline would worsen the syndrome, only 50 % identified meperidine as serotonergic despite the historical implications of this interaction. Also concerning was the belief that quetiapine had serotonin agonist activity reflecting failure to understand the mechanism of this commonly prescribed xenobiotic. Conclusion: Senior medical students require increased education on the pharmacology of commonly used serotonergic drugs in the ICU setting to avoid worsening serotonin syndrome or causing an iatrogenic adverse drug reaction. Objective: Recently, an effective antivenom for clinically significant scorpion envenomation has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is being increasingly used in emergency departments across the country, but no formal economic analysis on its impact on cost of management of these patients has been performed. Methods: Three different strategies of clinical management of scorpion envenomation with systemic neurotoxic symptoms in pediatric patients were compared for cost minimization from a third-party-payer perspective. In strategy I, patients with clinically significant scorpion envenomation with cranial nerve dysfunction and/or somatic skeletal neuromuscular dysfunction were managed with supportive care only and without use of scorpion antivenom. In strategy II, an aggressive strategy of fulldose Anascorp\u00ae antivenom (initial dose of three vials with the use of additional vials administered one vial at a time) was considered. In strategy III, a single-vial serial dosing strategy of Anascorp\u00ae titrated to clinical response was considered. Clinical probabilities for the different strategies were obtained from retrospective review of medical records of patients with scorpion envenomation over a 10-year period at our institution and from published information. Baselines cost values were obtained from patient reimbursement data from our institution. Indirect costs were not considered in this analysis. Results: In the baseline analysis, strategy I of supportive care only with no antivenom was the least costly at $3,466.50 per patient. Strategy III of singlevial serial dosing was intermediate but less expensive than strategy II of fulldose antivenom, with an incremental cost of $3,171.08 per patient. In a oneway sensitivity analysis, at a threshold antivenom cost of $1,577.87, strategy III of single-vial serial dosing became the least costly strategy. Conclusion: For children with scorpion envenomation with neurotoxic symptoms, use of a management strategy based on serial dosing of Anascorp\u00ae titrated to clinical response is less costly than a strategy of initial use of full-dose antivenom. Also, lowering the cost of antivenom would make use of titrated antivenom dosing in all children with significant neurotoxic symptoms the most favored strategy even compared to the strategy of conservative management without use of antivenom. Review of records and history is negative for other known causes of TTP. The mechanism by which this occurred is unknown. Proposed mechanisms include the effects of abuse-preventing inactive ingredients which are found in the newest reformulation. A comparison of inactive ingredients is made (Table) . Cases of TTP have not been linked to older formulations of Opana ER\u00ae suggesting a mechanism unique to the newest formulation. Conclusion: Hemolytic anemia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may occur following the intravenous injection of reformulated Opana ER\u00ae. Background: Although uncommon, severe ergotism continues to occur in Thailand. We sought to determine the precipitating factors and clinical manifestations of these cases. Method: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients with ergotism consulted to Ramathibodi Poison Center Bangkok, Thailand from January 2006 to August 2013. Cases were identified by substance codes, and data were abstracted by poison center senior scientist. Result: Twelve cases of ergotism were identified. Patient ages ranged from 15 months to 50 years. Nine patients were female. All cases were associated with ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg combination tablets. Nine cases (75 %) were precipitated by drug-drug interactions with CYP 3A4 inhibitors: lopinavir/ ritonavir (eight cases) and erythromycin (one case). In none of these cases was overdose suspected. The other cases involved suicidal intent (two cases) and accidental ingestion (one case). Ten patients had vascular insufficiency symptoms including cooling, numbness, pain, and pulse deficit in distal limbs, treated with vasodilators and anticoagulants. Five of these patients initially had low or unmeasurable blood pressure by noninvasive technique which resolved after intravenous vasodilator administration. One patient died from rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, two underwent partial foot amputations due to lower extremity gangrene, and seven patients recovered fully. Two patients did not develop vascular insufficiency symptoms. One was a 15-month-old boy with unsupervised ingestion of an unknown dose presented with alteration of consciousness and seizure. He was intubated, treated with diazepam and phenobarbital. He died on the next day. Another case was 14-year-old female who ingested 100 tablets with suicidal intent. She presented with vomiting and recovered with supportive care. Discussion: Severe ergotism cases continue to occur in Thailand. Most cases are caused by interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase ergotamine bioavailability at least fourfold. Factitious low blood pressure in these cases was caused by severe vasospasm. The severe symptom in 15-month-old case may be from poor metabolism of ergotamine and caffeine due to immature of CYP3A4 and 1A2, respectively. Conclusion: Severe ergotism can be precipitated by drug interaction and present with factitious hypotension caused by profound vasospasm. random serum vancomycin level of 160 mg/L. No other etiology of his renal injury was identified, although he had received a single dose of ibuprofen on the preceding day. Per the recommendations of the poison center, the patient was transferred to a pediatric tertiary care hospital, where continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) was performed with an HF 1,200 filter (Medivators, Inc.) at a flow rate of 100 mL/min for 16.5 h. During CVVH, the renal function improved and the vancomycin level declined to 38.9 mg/L. Using a first-order elimination model, the vancomycin half lives were estimated to be 53 h before CVVH and 9 h during CVVH. After hemofiltration, the patient's renal function continued to improve, and he was discharged with outpatient nephrology follow-up. Conclusion: Supratherapeutic vancomycin levels can lead to acute renal toxicity or can be exacerbated by primary renal injury. The primary mechanism underlying this patient's toxicity is not known. CVVH performed with a large-pore membrane appears to enhance the clearance of vancomycin and decrease its serum elimination half-life.",

In 2006, Oregon enacted a law requiring a prescription to obtain pseudoephedrine. No such law exists in Washington, which is thought to share similar sources of methamphetamine. The short-and long-term effect of Oregon's statewide pseudoephedrine law on methamphetamine-related deaths is unknown. Hypothesis: The 2006 Oregon law requiring a prescription for pseudoephedrine was associated with short-and long-term decreases in methamphetamine-related deaths. Discussion: A 2006 Oregon law that required a prescription for pseudoephedrine was associated with no change in short-or long-term methamphetamine-related deaths compared to a similar county in a neighboring state that did not enact a law. The years immediately following the law were associated with a short-term decrease in methamphetamine-related deaths, but a similar trend was also seen in King County, Washington, suggesting alternative variables may have been contributing, including national legislation or changes in the methamphetamine source, purity, and price secondary to the decrease in methamphetamine labs.",

Discussion: The initial decrease in methamphetamine-related poison center calls was seen in both Oregon and Washington, indicating that a possible confounding variable may have contributed to decreased methamphetamine-related calls. The initial decrease may represent a decline in methamphetamine use in the community or a change in potency/price resulting in decreased hospital admissions or emergency department visits. However, over a longer period, the call volume of both centers increased to levels similar to those in the pre-law periods, though Oregon call volumes remained decreased in the long term compared to Washington calls. Conclusion: A law restricting pseudoephedrine in Oregon was associated with a small long-term decrease in methamphetamine-related poison center call volume in Oregon compared to Washington. In the short term, the law was associated with a decrease in methamphetamine-related calls in both states. Conclusion: Restricting pseudoephedrine to prescription-only in the state of Oregon had no effect on methamphetamine treatment admissions. Background: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are newer anticoagulants being used more commonly in clinical practice. Cases of bleeding have been reported with use of these agents since approval.

Methods: Combined retrospective and prospective case series of exposures to dabigatran and rivaroxaban reported to our poison control system. Retrospective cases were identified between 1/11 and 5/12. Prospectively collected cases were collected from May 2012 to July 2013. Miscoded cases and those with possible warfarin co-ingestion were excluded. Other cases of co-ingestion were included. Main data variables collected included demographics, outcome, disposition, nature of exposure, treatments received, and laboratory parameters.",

Children age 12 or less accounted for five dabigatran and two rivaroxaban cases. Bleeding was reported in 15 dabigatran cases. There were four cases of acute selfharm overdose with dabigatran ranging from 1,800 to 3,900 mg. Mild bleeding was reported in only one of these overdose cases and there were no deaths in this group. There were two fatal hemorrhages in dabigatran cases, both in patients chronically on this medication. Coagulation parameters were abnormal in many cases and did not correlate well with bleeding or outcome. Bleeding was reported in five rivaroxaban cases, all in patients with chronic exposure to the drug without known overdose. No cases of intentional self-harm overdose of rivaroxaban were reported, and there were no deaths. None of the pediatric cases from either group had adverse outcomes or bleeding. Discussion: Adverse bleeding will continue to rise with exposures to the newer oral anticoagulants. Our data demonstrated that chronic dosing of these agents resulted in more episodes of bleeding than intentional overdose or excess dosing. Accidental pediatric exposures also resulted in few effects and no episodes of bleeding.",

Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were normal. Laboratory studies were within normal limits (Hgb, 12.4 mg/dL) except for a methemoglobin (MetHgb) level of 20.3 %. She was treated with a single intravenous bolus of 2 mg/kg methylene blue which resulted in complete resolution of her cyanosis and symptoms. A repeat MetHgb level 120 min after treatment was 1.9 %. A urine gas chromatography/mass spectrometry qualitative drug screen demonstrated dapsone. Nine hours after treatment, her MetHgb level was 7.2 %, she was asymptomatic, and was therefore discharged home.

Hypotension resolved following a 1,000 cm 3 bolus of 0.9 % saline. Rectal aspirin (300 mg), heparin, and six vials of crotaline Fab antivenom were administered in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for emergent cardiac catheterization and intubated for ongoing hypoxia. The circumflex artery revealed a 70-80 % midvessel stenosis with thrombus formation. There was additional thrombus formation just proximal to the branching point of the second obtuse marginal branch. After thrombectomy and stent implantation, there was no residual obstruction. The patient was extubated on hospital day #2. Fourteen vials of crotaline Fab antivenom were administered. He was discharged to home in good condition after 6 days in the hospital. Discussion: Complex hematologic abnormalities such as platelet aggregation are well described following crotaline envenomation including recognized species-dependent effects. In this patient with moderate coronary atherosclerosis, thrombus formation could be a complication of the hemotoxic venom effect of C. horridus. With the common use of anticoagulation and platelet-inhibiting medications in the setting of STEMI, management of STEMI in conjunction with crotaline envenomation presents unique challenges.

Case reports: (A) Aspirin toxicity was suspected in a 55-year-old man with a prior medical history of tuberculosis who presented with respiratory distress. FaceTime was used to confirm the patient's salicylism toxidrome (diaphoresis, tinnitus, confusion, and respiratory distress) as well as radiographs demonstrating TB scars and pulmonary edema. These visual details prompted a recommendation for emergency hemodialysis, even though lab results were pending. A salicylate level of 96 mg/dL was resulted just as hemodialysis was begun. (B) A 42-year-old man with anxiety, chest pain, and headaches admitted to taking amyl nitrate \"poppers\" just prior to arrival. FaceTime confirmed the presence of perioral and nailbed cyanosis, and oxygen saturation of 88 % despite oxygen supplementation. Empiric therapy with methylene blue supplementation was recommended, the patient's labs revealed methemoglobin level of 24 % and an elevated troponin (0.56 ng/dL). (C) A 6-year-old developmentally delayed girl swallowed dilute bleach from a mislabeled bottle. After choking and gagging initially, she returned to her baseline state, which included mutism and a predilection to drooling. FaceTime consultation with a toxicologist assured the emergency clinician and the patient's parents that the child was safe for discharge following an oral fluids trial.

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl abuse who presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of opioid withdrawal symptoms 5 days after last using oxycodone. He denied recent opioid or other drug use. On presentation, he was agitated, nauseated, tachypneic, diaphoretic, and complained of diffuse abdominal pain. Initial vital signs were temperature (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure (147/98), pulse (88), respiratory rate (32), and saturating (98 %) on room air. Urine drug screen was positive for opiates only. Four milligrams of lorazepam and 4 mg of midazolam were administered in attempt to control his agitation. Due to uncontrolled agitation, the patient was intubated. Further evaluation revealed diffuse ST segment depression on EKG with elevated serum troponin (initial 14 ng/mL, peak 44 ng/mL). A previous EKG from 1-year prior was normal. Cardiology was consulted and the patient started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. The patient underwent coronary angiography that revealed normal coronaries and left ventriculography demonstrated diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with apical sparing and an ejection fraction of 15 %. He was diagnosed with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and started on aspirin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and carvedilol. The patient left against medical advice on hospital day 3, therefore no follow up was obtained. Discussion: We believe that the patient developed stress-induced cardiomyopathy from opioid withdrawal secondary to abstinence. He was found to have new ST changes on EKG, troponin elevation with no evidence of coronary artery disease, and diffuse LV hypokinesis, this presentation is consistent with the Mayo diagnostic criteria for stress cardiomyopathy.",

The patient did not require sedation for intubation. Initially, copious secretions required oropharyngeal suctioning. Miosis was also present along with hypoactive bowels and relaxed neuromuscular tone. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and QTc of 490 ms. Urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines and comprehensive screen confirmed methadone and clozapine (which the patient was not prescribed)",

Qsymia, a combination of phentermine and extended release topiramate, was approved by the FDA in 2012 making it one of the first weight loss medications approved since fenfluramine/phentermine. Methods: This is a single-patient chart review. A 38-year-old obese woman presented to the emergency department with bilateral blurry vision for 1 day. In addition, she reported bilateral eye pain and flashes of light. She denied headaches, nausea, vomiting, or eye trauma. She had been taking Qsymia for 7 days as a weight loss aid. She had normal vitals and basic labs. Her eye exam demonstrated bilateral conjunctival injection, 4 mm reactive pupils, visual acuity 20/200 OD and 20/100 OS, intact extra-ocular movements, and normal retinas and ocular nerves on fundoscopic exam. She was found to have bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma (BAACG) with intraocular pressures (IOP) of 48 mmHg OU.",

Research question: Our aim was to survey and describe the opinions of MTs regarding their practice patterns and compensation. Methods: The ACMT practice committee conducted an anonymous, electronic survey of ACMT members regarding their practice patterns, compensation, and salaries. Survey invitations were sent out by e-mail to all ACMT members in December 2012. Reminder e-mails were sent in January and February 2013. Blinded results were analyzed using simple statistics. Results: There were 176 total respondents which represented a 49 % (176/360) response rate. The most common primary specialties were emergency medicine (81 %, 139/171), pediatrics (10 %, 17/171), and internal medicine (7 %, 12/171). The majority of the respondents (86 %, 150/175) completed MT fellowship. Of practicing MTs, 78 % identify themselves as working in academia, 64 % in clinical practice, and 58 % with a poison control center (PCC). The majority (59 %) of MTs surveyed report spending less than half of their time on MT activities and one third (31 %, 49/155) spend less than 25 % of their time on MT activities. Only 16 % (25/155) report practicing full time. Seven percent (11/150) of surveyed toxicologists receive full-time compensation from PCCs. Thirty-three percent (49/150) provide free work to a PCCs. Forty-six percent (68/149) of MTs do not feel that they are fairly compensated for their work. Fifty-four percent (85/157) would like to expand their toxicology activities. However, 87 % (137/158) believe that significant barriers to expansion exist. Discussion: Academia and PCC work are still the most common practice scenarios for MTs. Full-time MT practice is unusual. The majority of MTs spend less than half their professional time on toxicology-related activities. PCC work is common among MTs; full-time employment is unusual. Many MTs do not feel they are fairly compensated for toxicology work.",

While some of these ingestions are not common, carbamezapine, phenobarbital, and theophylline were among the ingestions treated with MDAC in the ToxIC Registry. The most common drug ingestion, however, in which MDAC was used in the Registry were salicylates despite consensus guideline specifically not recommending MDAC be used for salicylates (although this recommendation remains controversial). Conclusions: MDAC is infrequently used to facilitate drug elimination in ToxIC cases and practice contrasts somewhat from published guidelines. An update on MDAC use is warranted.Background: The clinical indications for the treatment of hydrogen cyanide toxicity in the critically ill patient have been described. However, minimally symptomatic patients often present to emergency departments in high numbers after potential cyanide exposure in the setting of house fires.

At 15, her levels had plateaued near \"normal\" after removal of a tongue stud verified to contain lead. Her BLL at 28 WG is 42.9 \u03bcg/dL. Medical toxicology is contacted when her BLL is 101 \u03bcg/dL at 34 WG. The patient denies pica and refuses hospital admission. After negotiation, the patient starts DMSA at home at 500 mg every 8 h (5 days) and then every 12 h (2 weeks). After she completes DMSA and removes two new tongue studs, her BLL is 32 \u03bcg/dL. She is induced at 37 WG, and a 2,790 g baby boy is vaginally delivered with APGAR scores of 9 at both 1 and 5 min. Cord and neonate BLL are 46 and 50 \u03bcg/dL, respectively. After she takes DMSA for 19 days, her BLL is 33 \u03bcg/dL. Discussion: The tongue studs are not verified lead sources; however, the patient's home revealed no source. Pica remains a common source of lead in pregnancy. Although chelating agents may cause teratogenicity in animals due to loss of essential nutrients, in most cases of prenatal chelation, infants develop normally in the short term. A case of DMSA prenatal chelation (maternal BLL, 44 \u03bcg/dL at 7 months gestation) resulted in cord BLL of 126 \u03bcg/dL at 37 WG, but infant was \"normal\" per pediatrician at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: Although one prior case report lacked significant improvement in maternal BLL after DMSA chelation, our case demonstrates that DMSA is a viable and safe option in pregnancy. Source removal remains most important in lead poisoning management.Background: Phencyclidine (PCP) is a synthetic compound derived from piperdine and used as an anesthetic and hallucinogenic. Little has been published regarding the clinical presentation of PCP intoxication. PCP use as a recreational drug is resurging.Objective: This study aims to quantify the incidence of clinical and behavioral findings in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) under the influence of PCP. Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary care center with an annual census of 90,000 patients/year. Physicians and research assistants identified patients with possible PCP intoxication, along with bystander/EMS and self-reported ingestions. A structured data collection form was completed obtaining both clinical and behavioral events observed during the ED visit. Results: We enrolled 179 patients, and two patients were excluded secondary to lost data. The mean age was 32 years old (20-53) and 64 % were male. Approximately half (47 %) self-reported PCP use. On arrival, 78 % of patients were awake and alert, and 48 % were oriented to self, time/date, and place. Mean physiological parameters were HR-101 bpm, RR-18 bpm, BP-146/86 mmHg, temperature-36.9\u00b0C, and pulse oxymetry-98 %. Clinical findings were 73 % amnesia, 64 % horizontal nystagmus, 52 % vertical nystagmus, 50 % hypertension, and 40 % agitation. Co-ingestions were reported 35 % of the time, 25 % with marijuana and 21 % with ETOH. Out of 177 patients, 153 had positive urine drug screens (UDS). PCP was positive in 152 (99 %), 63 positive for THC (41 %), 39 positive for benzodiazepines (BZD; 25 %), and 19 positive for opiates (12 %). The mean length of stay was 266 min, with 86 % discharged, 8 % admitted, and 6 % transferred to psychiatry. Conclusion: Patients with PCP intoxication tended to be young males. Prevalent clinical signs and symptoms were: amnesia, nystagmus, hypertension, and agitation. Co-ingestions were the norm; however, 25 % of patients with a positive UDS received BZD in the ED, therefore it may not represent a co-ingestant. The majority of patients had minimal alteration in vital signs and was discharged once their symptoms resolved. The increasing prevalence of PCP use as a recreational drug requires a better understanding of its clinical presentation.36. High Dose, Variable Length, N-acetylcysteine (HINAC) Therapy for Late-Presenting Acetaminophen Poisoning Eygnor J 1 , Dorai S 1 , Moore PW 2 , Donovan JW 2 , Burkhart KK 3 Lehigh Valley Health Network, Allentown, PA, USA; 2 PinnacleHealth, Harrisburg, PA, USA; 3 Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Silver Spring, MD, USAIntroduction: Two previous studies have demonstrated a decreased mortality from 58-80 to 37-52 % for patients with late-presenting acetaminophen poisoning who were treated with Prescott's N-acetylcysteine protocol. Since 1998, we have utilized a high dose, intravenous, variable length, and N-acetylcysteine (HINAC) regimen for patients with acetaminophen poisoning described as a 140 mg/kg loading dose of Nacetylcysteine followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h until the transaminases begin to decline.Objective: This study aims to describe our clinical experience of HINAC therapy for the treatment of late-presenting acetaminophen-poisoned patients. Methods: A retrospective, observational chart review of an institutionallyapproved HINAC protocol from 1998 to 2013 at two toxicology centers. Inclusion criteria included HINAC administration >24 h post-ingestion and/ or initial transaminases twice the upper limit of normal with history of >8 g of ingested acetaminophen. Patients were excluded by inadequate data, dosing deviation from HINAC protocol of >25 %, and chronic ingestion (>2 ingestions, separated by >8 h). Our primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes included liver failure (defined by transaminases >1,000 IU/L), King's College laboratory criteria for poor prognosis and anaphylactoid reactions. Outcomes were compared to previously published NAC regimens. Patients with late-presenting acetaminophen poisoning who are treated with HINAC have decreased mortality compared to previous studies (p<0.0001)37. Bedside Evaluation of Adverse Drug Events by Medical ToxicologistsFarmer BM 1 , Nelson LS 2 , Perrone J 3 , On behalf of the ACMT Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; 2 New York University School of Medicine/Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, NY, USA; 3-Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA Background: Adverse drug events (ADEs) are defined as untoward outcomes associated with the use of a drug, including adverse reactions and medication errors. ADEs contribute significantly to iatrogenic morbidity and mortality and are generally preventable. Medical toxicologists (MTs) may be consulted in the care of patients with ADEs due to severity of symptoms and their expertise in antidote use, drug interactions, and care of poisoned patients. Research question: We sought to describe the clinical characteristics of ADEs leading to bedside toxicology consultation. Methods: The ToxIC registry from January 2010 to October 2013 was examined to identify ADEs as the primary reason for consultation. These cases were analyzed for patient demographics, classes of drugs involved, presence of toxidromes, and clinical findings. Results: A total of 309 ADEs were identified involving 166 women and 143 men. Patients were between the ages of 19-65 (206), age >65 years old (64), and age <18 years old (37). There were 241 cases involving 1 drug and 51 cases involving more than 1 drug. Fourteen cases did not describe the drug involved. The most common drugs/classes of drugs Cardiovascular effects (91 cases) included heart rate and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Pulmonary findings (35 cases) were primarily respiratory depression. Neurologic abnormalities (196 cases) included altered mentation and seizures. Metabolic derangements (26 cases), gastrointestinal or hepatic abnormalities (31 cases), and renal injury or rhabdomyolysis (35 cases) were also frequently present. Discussion/Conclusions: MTs consult on a wide range of ADEs in patients of all ages. Toxidromes or organ-specific findings are often present and may lead clinicians to seek expert advice. Further analysis of this and similar cohorts may generate ADE prevention strategies.38.

Methamphetamine-Related Poison Center Calls Following Prescription Pseudoephedrine Legislation Stephani JA, Hendrickson RG Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA Background: Multiple national and statewide laws to control methamphetamine precursors including pseudoephedrine have been enacted to decrease clandestine lab manufacture and subsequent availability/use of methamphetamine. In 2006, Oregon enacted a law requiring a prescription to obtain pseudoephedrine. No such law exists in Washington, which is thought to share similar sources of methamphetamine. Hypothesis: That the 2006 Oregon legislation restricting pseudoephedrine decreased poison center calls in Oregon, but not Washington. Methods: Methamphetamine-related calls involving human exposures from OPC and WPC were evaluated from 2003 to 2012 and adjusted for population. Methamphetamine-related calls from 2003 to 2005 were used for comparison as pre-law call volume. The number of pre-law calls was compared to calls in the short term (2007-2009) and longer term (2010-2012). Results: Both the OPC and WPC had a statistically significant decrease in methamphetamine-related calls in the immediate post-law period [OPC, \u221289 calls (\u221262 %), 95 % CI, \u221256, \u2212121 calls, p=0.007], [WPC \u221274 calls (\u221255 %), (95 % CI, \u221236, \u2212112), p=0.014)]. However, by the later period (2010-2012), call volumes returned to their pre-law volumes [OPC, \u221214 (\u221210 %), (95 % CI, \u221224, 53), p=0.260, WPC, +13 (+10 %), (95 % CI, \u221260, 30), p=0.349).There was no difference between the change in volume in OR and WA in the short term (RR, 1.05; (95 % CI, 0.978, 1.13), p=0.166), whereas in the long term, OPC's call volume decreased 10 % and WPC's call volume increased 10 %, a difference that was statistically significant (RR 1.10, (95 % CI, 1.002, 1.21); p=0.044).Table (Abstract 75).

Hypothesis: The 2006 Oregon law requiring a prescription to obtain pseudoephedrine was associated with a change in treatment admissions for methamphetamine abuse as compared to neighboring states without similar laws.Methods: The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was evaluated for Oregon, Washington, and California from 2003 to 2009. The number of admissions to rehabilitation centers for methamphetamine abuse from 2003 to 2005 was compared to postlegislation admissions from 2007 to 2009 in Oregon, Washington, and California. Results: In Oregon, there were 683 admissions/100,000 population to methamphetamine treatment centers from 2003 to 2005 and 592 admissions from 2007 to 2009, representing a decrease in admissions by 13 % after enactment of the legislation. In the same time period, the rate of admissions to rehabilitation centers for methamphetamine abuse in California decreased by 6 % and in Washington increased by 1 % (CA and WA=3.9 %). There was no statistically significant difference when the rate of change of Oregon admissions was compared to Washington and California [RR=1.051 (95 % CI, 0.978, 1.129)]. Discussion: The 2006 law in the state of Oregon restricting pseudoephedrine to prescription-only had no significant effect on treatment admissions for methamphetamine. Future research may be directed at determining which other factors, such as drug purity or price or the source of methamphetamine (e.g., local production versus Mexico) may have on treatment admissions.",

Association of Methamphetamine Lab Incidents in States with Prescription Pseudoephedrine LawsStephani JA, Hendrickson RG Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA Background: Multiple national and statewide laws have been enacted to control the precursors for clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine. Currently, Oregon and Mississippi are the only states to require a prescription to obtain pseudoephedrine. A decrease in clandestine methamphetamine lab incidents has been demonstrated after enactment of these laws in these states, but it is unclear if other comparable states were seeing a similar decrease, suggesting possible national or regional confounding variables. Hypothesis: There was a more significant decrease in methamphetamine lab incidents in Oregon and Mississippi as compared to surrounding states without a law requiring a prescription for pseudoephedrine.Methods: Drug Enforcement Agency data on number of clandestine laboratory incidents by state was evaluated from 2004 to 2012. The Oregon law was enacted in 2006, and the number of labs in Oregon was evaluated for the period before the law (2004-2005) and compared to lab incidents in the short (2007-2008) and long term (2011-2012). The rates of change in number of lab incidents were compared to neighboring states Washington and California. Mississippi lab incidents were evaluated from 2008 to 2009 before the law was enacted in 2010, and compared to post-implementation period (2011-2012). The number of labs in Mississippi was compared to neighboring states Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee. Results: Total methamphetamine lab incidents in Oregon decreased significantly more than Washington and California (90 vs. 64 %) in the 2 years after the legislation [RR=1.24 (95 % CI, 1.210, 1.275)]. Over the longer term, methamphetamine lab incidents in Oregon decreased significantly more than Washington and California (98 vs. 95 %) over the 9year period from 2004 to 2012 [RR=1.024 (95 % CI, 1.011, 1.037)]. Mississippi methamphetamine lab incidents decreased significantly more than the surrounding states (76 vs. 38 %) of Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Missouri [RR=1.310 (95 % CI, 1.278, 1.344)].Discussion: Pseudoephedrine legislation was associated with a significant reduction of methamphetamine lab incidents in both states when compared to neighboring states. There was significant heterogeneity between states in the incidence of methamphetamine labs over the 9year study period. Conclusion: Legislation in both Oregon and Mississippi that restricted pseudoephedrine to prescription-only decreased methamphetamine laboratory incidents when compared to surrounding states without such legislation.Table (Abstract 79).

It is characterized by apical ballooning with hypokinesis. In inverse TC, the heart's apex is either normal or hyperdynamic with a hypokinetic base. There are several case reports of drug-induced TC, although very few cases of druginduced inverse TC are described. Hypothesis: Methamphetamine use is associated with inverse TC. Methods: This is a case report of a 17-year-old man with history of heroin, marijuana, and amphetamine abuse who complained of 3 days of worsening nausea, vomiting, and acute onset of chest pain after using marijuana and methamphetamine. Results: Patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 143 bpm, respiratory rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 109/64, and oxygen saturation of 77 % on room air. Exam revealed bilateral rales. No murmurs or peripheral edema was noted. CXR showed pulmonary edema with normal cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle, severely diminished motion in the basal and mid-wall segments, normal apical contraction, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 29 %. Troponin I was 4.68 ng/mL (<0.05 ng/mL). Pro-BNP was 18,701 pg/mL (<1,584 pg/ mL). Urine GC/MS confirmed presence of methamphetamine, amphetamine, and cannabinoids. An echo on day 2 revealed improved cardiac function (LVEF 38 %) On day 5, a left atrial thrombus was noted, and was treated with tPA and systemic anticoagulation. Eleven days after exposure, patient's LVEF was 41 %. He was discharged on lisinopril, spironolactone, carvediolol, furosemide, and coumadin. Discussion: The lack of upper respiratory symptoms, along with the temporal association between stimulant use and symptom onset, and the rapid improvement all suggest drug-induced etiologies, as opposed to a viral etiology. Very few cases have been reported on methamphetamine or amphetamine induced TC. Methamphetamine abusers may be at higher risk of developing cardiomyopathies compared to age-matched nonusers. Many of the reported cardiomyopathies are transient, as with TC and inverse TC. Mural thrombus is a known complication. LVEF and wall motion abnormalities should improve within 3-5 days and should return to baseline function within days to weeks. Conclusion: Methamphetamine use may lead to inverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.84.
