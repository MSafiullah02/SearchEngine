            "text": "Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious disease of pigs caused by infection with CSFV, and is a notifiable disease of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). CSF causes great economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. The disease was first recognized in China in the 1920s and there continue to be major epizootics in this country (Tu et al., 2001, Zhu et al., 2009). CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Its genome consists of a single-stranded (+) sense RNA of about 12.5 kb with a single large open reading frame (ORF), encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3400 amino acids. After translation, the polyprotein is cleaved into viral structural and non-structural peptides which are, from N- to C-terminus, Npro-C-Ems-E1-E2-P7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B. Npro is essential for evading the cellular antiviral defense system, and protects cells from double-stranded RNA-induced apoptosis (Ruggli et al., 2005). The NS3 serine protease cleaves at downstream cleavage sites (Tautz et al., 1997, Tautz et al., 2000) and additionally possesses helicase and NTPase activities essential for viral RNA replication (Gu et al., 2000, Moulin et al., 2007). NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is responsible for viral RNA replication (Zhang et al., 2005).",

One problem is that siRNA cannot entirely inhibit CSFV replication. This has been suggested to be due to loss of siRNA activity caused by point mutation or deletion of the siRNA target site (Konishi et al., 2006, Westerhout et al., 2005). In this study, single, double, and quadruple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids, with loxp sites at both ends of the selectable marker gene, were constructed and analyzed using the same promoters or four different promoters. Four different siRNA expressing from four different promoters can avoid recombination (ter Brake et al., 2008). Results show that CSFV inhibition was markedly stronger when multiple siRNAs were expressed targeting different genes of CSFV, and that siRNA target region mutation is not a major reason why CSFV replication cannot be completely blocked by RNAi. It also provides a basis for development of CSFV-resistant transgenic pigs, this is the reason why siRNA expression plasmids were constructed with loxp sites at each end of the selectable marker genes which could be excised by Cre-mediated loxP-flanked sequences.",

First, siRNA expression plasmids were constructed by inserting annealed oligonucleotides into the appropriate insertion sites, thereby encoding the siRNA transcription unit. Second, the pGenesil-siRNA4 plasmid was constructed from the different siRNA expression plasmids (phU6-siN1, pmU6-siNS3-2, ph7SK-siNS5B and phH1-siN2) by GeneSil Biotechnology Co. Finally, the siRNA cassette was digested and inserted into the SalI/XhoI sites of PGKneotpAlox2, yielding pLox-siRNA4 (see Fig. 2D).",

Previous studies have performed an analysis of a multiple siRNA expression strategy in which three or four siRNAs were expressed from the same promoters and found that this caused frequent recombinations at repeat sequences of the expression cassette, resulting in deletion of one or two cassettes (ter Brake et al., 2008). To prevent recombination, therefore, we selected four different promoters lacking sequence similarity for the four siRNA expression strategy. Human polymerase III promoters H1, U6 and 7SK and the murine polymerase III promoter U6 were selected because they have well defined transcription start and termination sites. Cloning the target sequences upstream of a reporter gene is a simple and convenient method for examining whether siRNA transcription occurs from multiple expression plasmids. Fig. 3 shows that each siRNA expression cassette was active, confirming that multiple siRNA expression from these promoters is a valid approach.",

Li et al. (2009b) created an EGFP reporter transgenic pig by applying the Cre/Loxp recombinase system. If the anti-CSFV activity of RNAi were to be combined with the technology of producing a transgenic pig, the result could be a pig resistant to CSFV infection. This is the reason why we constructed single and multiple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids with loxp sites at each end of the selectable marker genes which could be excised by Cre-mediated loxP-flanked sequences. Work to make this concept a reality is currently in progress.",
