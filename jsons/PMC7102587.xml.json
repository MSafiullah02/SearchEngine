On 11th March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as pandemic [1]. Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed an increased mortality in people with diabetes (2.3% vs. 7.3%; overall vs. in patients with diabetes respectively) from a report of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 [2]. People with diabetes and COVID-19 may need special attention and clinical care [3]. In the absence of any known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a \u201cpublic-health emergency\u201d, many drugs have been tried recently in the treatment for COVID-19 that includes a low-cost antimalarial drug chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), along with several other antiviral drugs. Because HCQ has been approved in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in India since 2014 as a third- or fourth-line drug, it would be interesting to research its impact in patients with diabetes, infected with COVID-19.",

It is also believed that chloroquine may have a varied mechanism of action which may differ depending upon the pathogen studied. It has been increasingly learnt that the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of chloroquine may have a role in the treatment of patients with novel COVID-19. Chloroquine increases endosomal pH and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and thereby it has the potential to block viral infection [7]. In addition, chloroquine also inhibits the quinone reductase-2, which is involved in sialic acid biosynthesis (an acidic monosaccharides of cell transmembrane proteins required for ligand recognition) that makes this agent a broad antiviral agent. It is important to note that both human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and orthomyxoviruses uses sialic acid moieties as a receptor. Moreover, chloroquine changes the pH of lysosomes and likely inhibits cathepsins, that leads to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, chloroquine through the inhibition of MAP-kinase interferes with SARS-CoV-2 molecular crosstalk, besides altering the virion assembly, budding and interfering with the proteolytic processing of the M protein [7,8]. Previous experimental studies have also demonstrated that chloroquine has potent anti-SARS-CoV-1 effects in vitro, primarily attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation receptors at the virus cell surface, so that it cannot bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine. Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the similar surface receptor ACE2, it is believed that chloroquine can also interfere with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus prevents SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the target cells [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. Chinese researchers who studied the effect of chloroquine in vitro (using Vero E6 cell line infected by SARS-CoV-2) found chloroquine to be highly effective in reducing viral replication that can be easily achievable with standard dosing due to its favorable penetration in tissues including the lung [6,10].",

It is believed that both the agents could be effective tools against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [10,11]. However, an important question that still remains is whether HCQ has a similar effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some data show HCQ effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine and one study found HCQ to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [12,13]. In addition, HCQ acts effectively on other intracellular bacterial infections such as Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Tropheryma whipplei (Whipple\u2019s disease) [14,15]. Addition of hydroxyl molecule makes HCQ less permeable to blood-retinal barrier and allows faster clearance from retinal pigment cell, thereby suggesting a lesser risk of retinal toxicity with HCQ, as compared to chloroquine [16]. Furthermore, the narrow therapeutic and safety index margin with chloroquine makes HCQ a safer option than chloroquine.",

            "text": "The second human study which is currently available was conducted with HCQ. In an open-label, non-randomized trial (n = 36) conducted in Marseille, France, Gautret et al. found that HCQ alone and combination of HCQ plus azithromycin was highly and significantly effective in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage (measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in only three-to six days in COVID-19 subjects, compared to control. The virological clearance day-6 post-inclusion (primary outcome) with HCQ vs. control was 70.0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p = 0.001). In addition, the virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion in HCQ plus azithromycin, HCQ and control arm was 100%, 57.1% and 12.5% respectively (p < 0.001). This data suggests a synergistic effect of azithromycin with HCQ. Indeed, azithromycin has shown an antiviral effect against Zika and Ebola viruses in in vitro studies; however, it is not yet known whether it has any action against COVID-19 as well [19]. These results of converting a potential carrier to a seronegative patient are of importance with regards to preventing community transmission of COVID-19. Since the data from Wuhan, China showed that some patients were carrier as long as up to 37 days (usually around 20 days), results of this study are very encouraging in the context of converting a patient to a seronegative subject within 6 days. Interestingly, this study also showed that the effect of HCQ was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in symptomatic patients as compared to asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. The authors have acknowledged limitations of the study; a small sample size, dropout of six patients and limited follow-up, apart from the non-randomized and open-label nature of the trial. A close look in to this study also suggests that the Cycle threshold (Ct) value for nasopharyngeal swab PCR to call it as a sample negative, was lower (Ct value > 35 was deemed as negative for virus) compared to conventional Ct threshold of >40. Ct is defined as the number of cycles to be run for the PCR test to turn positive. In other words, lower the number of Ct denotes more virus is present and lesser number of cycles are required to hit the threshold. Moreover, nasopharyngeal swab PCR is a less sensitive tool, compared to PCR of Broncho-alveolar lavage and sputum in COVID-19. Furthermore, exclusion of five patients (26%) receiving HCQ from the overall analysis, exaggerate the final results of this study.",

The expert consensus from the Department of Science and Technology and Health Commission of Guangdong province published on 20th February (based on in vitro evidence and still unpublished clinical experience) chloroquine phosphate tablet at a dose of 500 mg twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the absence of contraindication to the drug [21]. A Central Clinical Task Force from Korea who have treated 27 cases of COVID-19 recommend using lopinavir 400mg/Ritonavir 100 mg BID or Chloroquine 500 mg orally per day or Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg orally per day for 7\u201310 days, in moderate to severe case of COVID-19 [22]. Similarly, The Dutch Center of Disease control in a public document on its website, also suggested the use of chloroquine in those having severe COVID-19 infection admitted in the intensive care unit [23]. Table 2\nsummarizes the recommendation and dosing from all the various groups [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]].",

Since both these drugs have the potential to prolong QTc, routine electrocardiography is essential prior to starting these drugs. Co-administration of other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (such as anti-arrhythmic, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-histaminic, teneligliptin, ondansetron and moxifloxacin etc.) must be avoided [38,39]. Moreover, addition of azithromycin to HCQ as done in French trial by Gautret et al. may increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Perform ECG daily if QTc is 450\u2013500 msec. Additionally, hypoglycemia must be looked for in patients with diabetes especially with concurrent use of chloroquine/HCQ and lopinavir/ritonavir. Chloroquine and HCQ should not be used concurrently with lopinavir/ritonavir and remdisivir for anticipated QTc prolongation. Finally, pharmacovigilance on visual and mental disturbance is also closely required.",

We have summarized current consideration and proposed line of management in Table 3\n.

A search of The ClinicalTrial.org database dated March 21, 2020 showed 4 trials with chloroquine and 3 trials with HCQ which is currently under progress and have been summarized in Table 4. A list of 23 trials are already enlisted with both compounds at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) [41]. We believe that it would be wise to conduct a quick interim analysis from these trials as soon as possible to find out the results that can be applied to the masses across the globe to curb the menace of COVID-19 pandemic.2.Research for resistance to drugs in already mutating virus strains: Another area which needs to be explored further is resistance to chloroquine and HCQ that may be present with different strains of the virus.3.Role of these drugs in COVID-19 chemoprophylaxis: Another knowledge gap that still remains is about role of these drugs in chemoprophylaxis. We still do not know whether these compounds can be useful to prevent the transmission of the virus, especially for healthcare workers. This needs to be tested in further studies.4.Use of HCQ in patients with diabetes in India where it is already approved for treatment: It would be interesting to research COVID-19 infection in patients with diabetes who are already on HCQ for treatment of diabetes. Further, the effect of HCQ on glycemia, cardiovascular function and viral load, in patients with diabetes needs to be researched.\n",
