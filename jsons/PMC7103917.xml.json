            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a very contagious pathogen that has become a major economic burden for U.S. swine producers since its initial North American detection in May 2013. This coronavirus is estimated to have killed over 7 million pigs in 2013 alone with significant additional swine morbidity and mortality in subsequent years (Chen et al., 2014, Cima, 2013, Cima, 2014). Infection with PEDV induces severe diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting in all age groups of swine but most notably results in extremely high mortality (80\u2013100%) in neonatal piglets (Cima, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013). Fecal-oral transmission involving contaminated fomites, such as vehicles, farm equipment, clothing, and feedstuffs, has been implicated in wide-spread distribution of the virus within and between farms (Dee, Neill, Clement, Christopher-Hennings & Nelson, 2014; Dee et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2014).",

The vast majority of PEDV control studies have focused on various applications of chemical disinfectants, heat, alterations to pH, and drying. Chemical disinfectants have received the most attention and many classes are able to inactivate PEDV (Bowman et al., 2015b, Schneider et al., 2015). However, some chemical disinfectants are corrosive to metal surfaces, hazardous to human and animal health, and inactivated with organic material and water with high mineral content (Babb et al., 1980, Racioppi et al., 1994). Additionally, most chemical disinfectants require prolonged contact times to achieve maximum effectiveness (Rutala, Weber, David & the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HIPAC), 2008), which can be problematic in various sectors of the high-throughput swine production chain.",

PEDV has been shown to maintain infectivity at temperatures as high as 50 \u00b0C, but infectivity is lost when heated above 60 \u00b0C for 30 min (Hofmann & Wyler, 1989). Within the U.S. swine industry, it has been advised for animal hauling trailers to be heated to 71 \u00b0C for 10 min to ensure inactivation of PEDV (Thomas et al., 2015b). However, use of heat in this setting requires specialized equipment and a prolonged period, which can be a challenge in such a high turn-over industry. While not targeting PEDV, animal harvest facilities routinely use the application of 83 \u00b0C water for approximately five seconds to thermally inactivate many pathogens on meat cutting equipment (Taormina & Dorsa, 2007). The present study sought to investigate hot water as a method for rapid thermal inactivation of PEDV.",

Previously described methods were used to measure tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) for all positive samples (Bowman et al., 2015b). Mean TCID50 values were calculated for each triplicate, which were subsequently log-transformed, normality visually assessed, and compared using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Once the virus was introduced to the United States, PEDV spread rapidly across the country, likely through gaps in biosecurity protocols (Bowman et al., 2015a, Lowe et al., 2014). The relative ease with which this virus can spread via fomites is due in part to the extremely low dose required to infect na\u00efve pigs (Thomas et al., 2015a); even miniscule amounts of viable virus appear to be adequate to initiate large swine outbreaks. Furthermore, with the ability to survive in the environment for up to 180 days in soybean meal (Dee et al., 2015) and 9 months in manure storage structures (Tun, Cai, & Khafipour, 2016), PEDV can persist long enough in the swine production chain to circumvent typical management practices designed to protect the health of pigs. Heated water may be useful in situations where penetration of objects with chemical disinfectants is difficult and where corrosion of the target materials (e.g. metal surfaces, rubber gaskets, etc.) should be minimized.",

This limitation is important to consider when developing disinfection strategies to prevent the transmission of PEDV to na\u00efve swine. One challenge with the use of many classes of disinfectants is the inability to disrupt RNA beyond the threshold of detection, which makes it impossible to discern disinfection effectiveness from a PCR positive test result (Bowman et al., 2015b; Thomas et al., 2015b). Heated water is not immune from this challenge as PEDV nucleic acid was detected via rRT-PCR in all samples in the present study, including those rendered non-infectious by their treatment.",

However, the desired treatment temperature was always verified at the time of inoculation and given the observed rapid results, we concluded the temperature fluctuations were of minimal impact. Additionally, the first sampling time point (5 s post inoculation) may not have provided sufficient time for thorough mixing prior to sample collection. It is also important to note that cell culture assay may underestimate the actual viral infectivity when compared to animal bioassays. Further studies might include observing the infectivity in neonatal pigs in comparison to weaned pigs which would validate whether hot water would be a feasible disinfectant for a swine farm (Thomas et al., 2015a).",
