Due to their widespread use in sport fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes, there are increasing concerns that baitfish may introduce or disseminate fish pathogens. In this study, we evaluated whether baitfish purchased from 78 randomly selected retail bait dealers in Michigan harbored fish viruses. Between September 2015 and June 2016, 5,400 baitfish divided into 90 lots of 60 fish were purchased. Fish were tested for the presence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), golden shiner reovirus (GSRV), fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV), fathead minnow picornavirus (FHMPV), and white sucker bunyavirus (WSBV). Using the epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line and molecular confirmation, we demonstrated the presence of viruses in 18 of the 90 fish lots (20.0%) analyzed. The most prevalent virus was FHMNV, being detected in 6 of 30 lots of Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas and 3 of 42 lots of Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides. We also confirmed GSRV in two fish species: the Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas (5 of 11 lots) and Fathead Minnow (3 of 30 lots). Two VHSV (genotype IVb) isolates were recovered from a single lot of Emerald Shiners. No SVCV, FHMPV, or WSBV was detected in any of the fish examined. Some of the infected fish exhibited clinical signs and histopathological alterations.

Surprisingly, some of the infected fish exhibited pronounced external signs of disease and yet remained for sale, with the possibility of ultimately finding their way into numerous waterbodies. This study clearly documents that the end of the trade custody chain (i.e., baitfish retail shops) represents a source for the potential introduction of viruses to public waters via angler-purchased and potentially released baitfish. This situation highlights the need for regulatory intervention to implement health inspection of the baitfish supply chain. Considering the ease with which viruses can be disseminated due to their wide host range and the ecological niche of these prey fish species, one would expect that VHSV, FHMNV, and GSRV will continue their expansion-not only in the Great Lakes but also in the inland lakes and waterways of Michigan. The potential increased risk from VHSV and FHMNV spreading via the baitfish trade is indeed alarming, particularly because of the pathological consequences of these viruses. Additionally, since 61 of the 159 fish species residing in the Great Lakes basin are threatened or endangered (GLFC 2016), an expansion of viruses with wide host range via the baitfish trade could exacerbate the tenuous status of the fish stocks that are at risk. In the same context, many important fish species that are the focus of stock enhancement programs at state and federal hatcheries in the Great Lakes region are fed with baitfish purchased from private sources prior to their stocking in public waters. The Muskellunge is one such species that is fed baitfish in hatcheries and has proven susceptible to both VHSV and FHMNV (Faisal et al. 2012 . As a consequence, this practice may expose a highly susceptible fish species to potentially lethal, debilitating viral infections, and widespread stocking of these fish may lead to further expansion into new geographic areas.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 225, "end": 244, "text": "(Faisal et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1928, "text": "(Faisal et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A major finding of this study was the detection of the OIE-reportable VHSV in Emerald Shiners (Faisal et al. 2012) .

Whether the two Emerald Shiner isolates form a distinct genomovar remains to be elucidated. In a previous study, Thompson et al. (2011) compared the partial G-gene sequence of 108 VHSV-IVb isolates from the Great Lakes and found the genetic diversity among the isolates to be relatively low; however, those authors were able to identify 11 unique sequences.

This is also alarming because the prevalence by lot in these species reached 12.5% (9 positive lots of 72 lots examined), and the number of positive pools within these lots reached as high as 11 of 12 pools. As the name of the virus implies, the Fathead Minnow is believed to be the primary host. However, several other baitfish species were reported to contract the infection naturally (e.g., Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus; McCann 2012) or experimentally (e.g., Spotfin Shiner Cyprinella spiloptera and Golden Shiner; Baird and Faisal 2016) , indicating the relatively wide host range of the virus among cyprinids. Thus, the relatively high prevalence of FHMNV in baitfish retail stores constitutes a potential hazard for cyprinid populations in the receiving waterbodies. In this study, FHMNV was identified both in apparently healthy fish (5 of 9 positive lots) 260 and in fish exhibiting clinical signs. This indicates that a definitive diagnosis should be based on virus isolation and confirmation by molecular or serological testing. The risk of FHMNV extends also to Muskellunge raised in hatcheries, where baitfish constitute a primary food source. Indeed, Muskellunge are vulnerable to FHMNV infection and can contract the virus by cohabitation and predation on infected fish Faisal et al. 2016) .

It likely also reflects the lack of basic biosecurity practices at bait shops, including the removal of moribund and dead fish, based on mortalities observed in tanks during collections. The prevalence of FHMNV and the existence of VHSV in the retail bait shops combined with the high frequency of baitfish use among anglers result in a high risk for new introductions (Drake and Mandrak 2014) . This risk is particularly elevated when considering that anglers have been documented to release unused baitfish at rates as high as over 40% (Litvak and Mandrak 1993; Kilian et al. 2012 ). As such, there is a need for managerial intervention to abrogate or slow down the rate of viral expansions from this vector. In Michigan, with regard to all baitfish imported from out of state or harvested from Michigan waters, an annual health inspection of retail vendors and health certification of baitfish dealers should be required for each pathogen of concern, especially VHSV.
