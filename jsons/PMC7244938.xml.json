In adults, the most common presenting symptoms are fever (76\u201391%), cough (63\u201365%), fatigue (38.5\u201350%), dyspnea (14\u201344%), anorexia (12\u201324%), diarrhea (15\u201328%), and myalgia (11\u201322%) [1\u20133]. In children, fever (36\u201341.5%), cough (19\u201348.5%), and diarrhea (9\u201312%) are most common [4\u20136]. Although myalgias are common in adults, no studies in children noted the presence of myalgias [4, 5]. There have been a few reported cases of COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis in adults, but no such cases have been reported in children [7\u201310].",

            "text": "Rhabdomyolysis is defined as the breakdown of skeletal muscle leading to leaking of muscle contents into the extracellular fluid [11]. Although there is no official consensus, it is usually defined by a serum creatine kinase (CK) of > 1000 U/L, which is five times the upper limit of normal [11]. Patients with rhabdomyolysis can be asymptomatic or present with myalgia, weakness, myoglobinuria with dark urine, significant electrolyte imbalance, and acute kidney injury [11]. Rhabdomyolysis in children is commonly caused by viral myositis, trauma, connective tissue disorders, and drug overdose [11]. The most common viral causes of rhabdomyolysis are influenza A and B viruses followed by HIV and enteroviruses [12]. Rarely, other viruses have been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis, including coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 [12, 13]. Here we present a case of pediatric COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis.",

Five days prior to admission, he began to feel fatigue. Four days prior to admission, he noted myalgias of his arms, legs, abdomen, and back, as well as mild shortness of breath on exertion. One day prior to admission, he was evaluated by an urgent care center where he was febrile to 38.9 \u00b0C. He denied any congestion, rhinorrhea, anosmia, inability to taste, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Of note, he was found to have cola-colored urine. When asked about the duration of dark urine, he stated it had been occurring for 2 days, but his mother was not certain that his estimation was accurate given his autism spectrum disorder. He took acetaminophen intermittently in the days prior and denied taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. The family history was significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

His blood pressure was initially elevated at 133/87 mmHg but lowered to normal range without intervention. He was well appearing on exam, with the only focal findings being pharyngeal erythema and diffuse abdominal pain. Initial laboratory work-up revealed a slight elevation in white blood cell count at 10.74 K/uL and slightly low platelets at 138 K/uL. Serum creatinine was normal for age at 0.89 mg/dL and electrolytes were within normal range. AST and ALT were elevated at 839 U/L and 157 U/L, respectively, and GGT was normal at 37 U/L. Urinalysis showed a pH of 6.0, large blood with 11\u201325 RBC/HPF and 6\u201310 WBC/HPF. Random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was elevated at 0.81 mg/mg. Kidney ultrasound with Doppler and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Respiratory pathogen PCR panel was negative, but COVID-19 PCR was positive. Hepatitis and cytomegalovirus serologies were negative. Epstein-Barr serologies were indicative of resolved past infection. Antistreptolysin O screen was not elevated and throat culture was negative. C3 and C4 were normal. Antinuclear antibody, double-stranded DNA, and anti-glomerular basement membrane IgG results were all negative. The patient\u2019s CK level was 427,656 U/L.",

Ferritin was normal, but procalcitonin (0.22 ng/mL), lactate dehydrogenase (2184 U/L), C-reactive protein (24.9 mg/L), and troponin (58 ng/L) were elevated. Echocardiogram was normal. Toxicology screen was negative. Incidentally, hemoglobin A1c was found to be elevated in the diabetic range at 8.2%.

His blood pressures became persistently elevated and amlodipine 5 mg daily was initiated. Starting on hospital day 7, he no longer complained of myalgias and did not require further analgesic medications. On hospital day 9, his CK was 36,294 U/L and his urine was negative for blood, so the fluid rate was decreased. Urine myoglobin was resent and was elevated at 45 mcg/L. On hospital day 11, his CK was 11,732 U/L and urine remained negative for blood. His fluids were stopped along with his amlodipine as his blood pressures normalized.

            "text": "In general, the pathogenesis of different types of viral rhabdomyolysis has been debated and includes direct invasion of the muscle by virus, cytokine storm resulting in muscle damage, and muscle injury by circulating viral toxins. Chen et al. postulated that SARS-CoV-1-associated rhabdomyolysis was secondary to cytokine storm rather than direct viral invasion due to the presence of high inflammatory markers and the lack of viral particles on muscle biopsies [13]. There are no reports of muscle biopsies in patients with COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis, but similar to SARS, COVID-19 is also associated with high inflammatory markers. This may indicate that rhabdomyolysis in COVID-19 could be cytokine-mediated.",

Rhabdomyolysis and elevated CK may be under-recognized complications of COVID-19 in pediatrics. Given this pediatric case of COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis and the multiple reports in adults, pediatric clinicians should be aware of this complication. We recommend checking CK levels in pediatric patients presenting with myalgia, especially those with urinary changes or acute kidney injury. When treating rhabdomyolysis, aggressive fluid administration is important to prevent acute kidney injury. However, it is especially important to monitor for signs of heart failure and pulmonary edema as these complications can occur in COVID-19 patients even without aggressive fluid administration.",
