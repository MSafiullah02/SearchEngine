The authors concluded, that IL28B CC is associated with an state of enhanced anti\u2010viral immune response, which on the one hand leads to higher viral clearance and on the other hand to more necroinflammatory activity. Different proinflammatory, anti\u2010viral cytokines could result in more hepatic inflammation and higher rates of viral clearance in early infection. Conversely, these cytokines might precipitate clinical decompensation in patients with more progressive liver disease. The fact that IL28B CC genotype is associated with enhanced anti\u2010viral immune response which promotes both viral clearance and inflammation, but not fibrosis progression suggests different and independent mechanisms for fibrogenesis.",

Thus, pre\u2010treatment determination of IL28B might still have its usefulness, although its effect on treatment response might be attenuated in highly active anti\u2010viral regimes combining two or three different DAA classes. Still, patients carrying the beneficial genotype might benefit from shorter treatment durations. Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that IFN\u2010free treatment regimes will not be affordable in many parts of the world in the near future. It is to be expected that in developing countries and even in most countries of Eastern Europe IFN and RBV will be the backbone of anti\u2010viral treatment for chronic hepatitis C for the next years. The determination of IL28B might have its value in individualising therapy to optimise cost effectiveness and furthermore spare side effects.55 Thus, further prospective studies are in need to evaluate the impact of IL28B on treatment success in IFN\u2010free treatments. Establishing predictive factors may allow shortening treatment further allowing reducing the cost of the new anti\u2010viral treatment.

Further analysis also identified SNPs on two functional variants carrying the rs6051702 C allele (rs1127354 and rs7270101) that are also highly protective against RBV induced anaemia in European\u2013American HCV GT 1 patients.76 After these impressive findings, Ochi H. et al. showed equal results in Japanese patients.84 Subsequent analysis identified that this effect persists over the whole treatment period85 and also applies for HCV genotype 2, 3 and 6 patients,86, 87 and patients on triple therapy with telaprevir.88, 89 However, ITPA polymorphisms showed no effect on treatment response in patients on PEG/RBV/TVR therapy.90 Data of patients treated with PEG/RBV/BOC are currently missing. Our own group analysed RBV\u2010induced anaemia according to gender in HCV GT 1 patients on PEG/RBV treatment91 and demonstrated that the haemoglobin drop is less in young female patients compared to post\u2010menopausal or male patients. This effect is greatest in young female patients with an ITPA variant and persists at least until treatment week 24. The reason for this observation is unknown, but one can assume that this might be due to the different hormone status.",
