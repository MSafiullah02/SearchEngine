NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. His breathing stabilized, and extubation was performed on day 8. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Blood test performed on day 9 showed severely increased CK level (181,650 U/L) and acute kidney injury (Cre 2.6 mg/dL). Thereafter, the CK level decreased gradually, and his condition normalized.

However, the direct association of favipiravir with NMS remains unknown. In the current two cases, favipiravir was discontinued on day 10 in case 1 and on day 8 in case 2. Consequently, fever subsided in both the cases in conjunction with other therapies. The number of COVID-19 positive patients being treated with favipiravir is increasing not only in Japan, but also across the world, including countries like China and the United States [11,12]; therefore, further research on the association between favipiravir use and NMS development in COVID-19 patients is warranted.",
