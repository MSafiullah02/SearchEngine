            "text": "We propose a simple SIR model in order to investigate the impact of various confinement strategies on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID-19 epidemic.",

First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.",

This is all the more true when the phenomena in question cannot be reproduced in the laboratory, for practical or ethical reasons. Prominent among the aforementioned are epidemics. Considered as a sub-branch of population dynamics, epidemics lent themselves perfectly to mathematical modelling. The history of such approaches goes back to the 18th century and D. Bernoulli who, in 1760, presented a work [1] on the mortality rate due to smallpox and the advantages presented by vaccination.

            "text": "The current pandemic sweeping the globe has rekindled the interest in epidemics. Modelling is one of the approaches used in order to identify the best strategy for the mitigation of the devastating effects. The present paper is an attempt at answering, in a modelling framework, the fundamental question of the how to implement efficiently a population confinement. Several works have recently addressed the same question from various perspectives. Four recent papers are the product of the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 Working Group) of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. A stochastic transmission model was used first to estimate the daily reproduction number before and after confinement measures, from data obtained from the Wuhan province. Based on this estimate, the authors of [2] conclude that even a small number of infections introduced in a previously unaffected area may lead to an epidemic outbreak. In the second paper [3] , based on the same model, the authors conclude that what plays a major role in determining whether an outbreak is controllable is the delay between the onset of symptoms and the introduction of social distancing measures based on contact tracing. However the necessity of an efficient contact tracing increases with the value of the daily reproduction rate making its practical implementation particularly arduous. Quantifying contacts was the object of the third paper [4] of the team based on a largescale data collection concerning the possible (albeit self-reported) contacts of a population of 36000 volunteers. In the fourth paper [5] the authors identify the role of the moment for the relaxation of the physical distancing measures claiming that the benefit of a somewhat delayed relaxation is the reduction of the height of the epidemic peak. Their projections show that a premature lifting of the measures may lead to a secondary peak. A team of Imperial College led by N. Ferguson, examined the two strategies of suppression versus mitigation. While the latter aims at just slowing down the epidemic so as not to overwhelm the healthcare system, the former's objective is to reduce the number of infected to a very low level and maintain it there permanently. Mitigation is a more palatable solution (although the authors consider a five month duration of the measures) but it may still lead to a staggering number of deaths and an epidemic resurgence when the interventions are relaxed. The studies [6] of the Imperial College team show that the timely adoption of measures (be they mitigation or suppression) are of the utmost importance as far as the consequences of the epidemic are concerned. Any unwarranted delay may result in a huge number of additional infections and deaths. The team of Stanford under E. Mordecai constructed an interactive model [7] which simulates the effects of social distancing. Just as in the previous studies a resurgence of the epidemic is predicted if the controls are lifted too quickly. They also model what they call the 'light-switch' approach where confinement is turned on and off in response to the seriousness of the epidemic resurgences. A team of the University of Oxford [8] applied modelling techniques to the data collected in Italy and the UK. Their conclusion is that the epidemic has started at least a month before the first reported death and would have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, in the absence of any intervention. On the positive side, their analysis seems to indicate an accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity.",

As explained clearly in [13] , a vaccination policy presents a challenge.

The comparison is quite interesting: the profile of the epidemic, i.e. the evolution of the infectives over time, is the same with both initial conditions, just shifted in time. Thus by following the evolution of the epidemic one cannot go back in time and guess when the first infection took place.

The downside is that the healthcare system can easily be overwhelmed by the sheer number of infected people.

As expected, an abrupt exit has as a consequence a sharp decline in the population of those who were previously confined. Being now in contact with the infectives they can become infected, which explains the sharp increase observed in Figure 7 . A progressive exit, although also leading to increased infections, has a much smaller effect and a definitely smoother variation of the susceptible population. Figure 10 summarises the behaviour of the total population of infected people for the four scenarios considered here, no-confinement, confinement with abrupt exit, progressive exit and stepwise exit. As expected the number of globally infected people is larger in a no-confinement scenario. This is the one offering the most efficient 'herd-immunity' but the price to pay is a high number of infections concentrated in time. The abrupt exit scenario has a relatively smaller number of infected people, but as we saw it presents the danger of a second epidemic wave being worse than the first. The progressive strategies are the ones leading to the smallest number of infected people. While this has the advantage of keeping the epidemic manageable all along it is not optimal if what was sought to begin with was an as large as possible immunisation of the population.

The curves labelled as (a), (b) etc. correspond to increasing progressive durations of the lockdown exit T 2 , while the dashed curve is the one obtained for an abrupt exit. Clearly the latter would requite a more prolonged confinement period for the second epidemic peak not to be higher than the first. One can notice that since we study the different scenarios of ending confinement, the height of the first peak, reached during confinement, before starting to lift the constrains, is the same for all the values of the studied variables. Figure 11 . The curve represent the variation of the ratio of the second to the first peak of the infection curve as a function of the duration of the strict lockdown T 1 . Curve (a) corresponds to the duration of the progressive exit (or lighter confinement period) T 2 = 1, curve (b) to T 2 = 3, curve (c) to T 2 = 5 and curve (d) to T 2 = 7.

The gravity of the situation, has made mandatory the introduction, in most countries, of lockdown measures aiming at containing the epidemic, so as not to overwhelm fragile healthcare systems. Our model is a classical SIR one, where the population of the susceptibles is spilt into two subgroups, one which is essentially confined and one, which, due to specific duties, cannot follow strictly the social distancing directives.

First, we show that an abrupt end of confinement can lead to a second peak of epidemic higher than the first one, for a confinement that lasts 10 units of time in the model (50 days). However, even with an abrupt end, the ratio between the two peaks of epidemic can be smaller than 1, but this requires a long confinement, longer than 12.6 units of time (which represents 63 days), see Figure 11 . In practice, in order to be sure that the second peak is much lower than the first one, the strict lockdown should be imposed for at least 2.5-3 months.

On figure 11 , for curve (d) for example (that corresponds to T 2 =7), the time interval for strict confinement T 1 has to be equal to 8 units of time if we want a ratio smaller than 1. The total time of confinement (including the period of strict and of lighter confinement) would thus be 15 units of time. For the abrupt exit, a duration of confinement of 12.5 units of time would suffice in order to have a ratio smaller than 1. Figure 11 also tells us that first, the ratios for an abrupt exit and for a progressive one tend to the same (lower than 1) value, as the time of confinement T 1 gets larger. With T 1 = 30 (meaning that the confinement would last 150 days, or 5 months), the number of infected people gets really small, but since it is not zero, the epidemics can start again when the lockdown is finally lifted, giving rise to a second, low peak, which has the same height whether the exit is progressive or not. We should point out at this point that applying a linear exit strategy in practice presents considerable difficulties. Changing rules every week or even everyday to ensure the linear lifting of the lockdown is far from ideal.",

            "text": "The stepwise strategy also allows to get ratios smaller than 1, if the duration of the confinement is long enough and if the intermediate infection rate a 1 for the confined people is not too large. However, what is interesting is that this intermediate value can be larger than 1: this means that even if the epidemic threshold is exceeded for the confined people, the peak of the epidemics can still be controlled, if the strict confinement period is long enough. For example, suppose that the confinement lasts 10 units of time in the model, or 50 days, (this situation corresponds to curve (c) in Figure 12 ), then any value of a 1 (the intermediate value of the infection rate of confined people) smaller than 1.8 would lead to a second peak lower than the first one. Moreover, this strategy allows to get less infected people at the end (see Figure 10 ). This strategy seems to be easier to put into practice, as it does not necessitate a continuous change the rules. The difficult part here is to translate the parameters of the model into practical instructions. What can represent the value of 1.8 for a 1 ? A situation between the strict confinement and a completely normal one, where, for example, everybody wears a mask, where those who can go to work do so, but work-place cafeterias are closed, where schools are still closed and where meetings of more than 10 persons are forbidden could be a good intermediate state. A more detailed model, with a structured population would be needed to answer that question. However, in all cases one should bear in mind the words of Ferguson [21] : \"Models are not crystal balls. What we are building are simplified representations of reality\". Thus is some cases it is preferable to work with a simpler model which allows control over the various quantities in play and makes it possible to develop an intuitive grasp of the situation.",
