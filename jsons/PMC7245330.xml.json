However, to gain a complete understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect commercial driver stress, health, and safety over time \u2013 and to be able to ascertain how to best take action to mitigate these impacts \u2013 research and prevention efforts must be grounded in theoretical perspectives that contextualize these impacts within the chronic stressors already endemic to profession, the historical and ongoing forces that have induced them, and the potentially reinforcing nature of the resulting afflictions. Thus, using U.S. long-haul truck drivers as an illustrative example, we advocate for using syndemic frameworks to guide research and prevention regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial driver stress, health, and safety.",

Macroeconomic forces related to declines in manufacturing wages, which are strongly correlated with truck driver wages, have eroded earnings over time (Belman and Monaco, 2001). Federal policy changes have generated downstream impacts on the work organization of LHTD \u2013 in particular, the passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which deregulated the trucking industry (Belzer, 2000) and led to reduced LHTD union presence and protections and intense trucking industry competition, resulting in declines in wages and working conditions (Belman and Monaco, 2001). Even federal policies intended to protect roadway safety have had counterintuitive impacts that have increased LHTD stress. For example, federal hours-of-service (HOS) laws create a regulatory environment where drivers are subject to the intense competitive pressures in the current trucking industry and yet are liable for HOS violations as they try to meet these demands (Belman and Monaco, 2001).",

The intense competition ushered in by deregulation has resulted in rigorous and erratic work schedules, often characterized by long work hours and shift work (Apostolopoulos et al., 2013; Lemke et al., 2017). \u201cBy-the-mile\u201d pay, the most common form of LHTD compensation, is illustrative of competition-driven wage declines and only provides drivers with income when their vehicles are moving and does not fairly compensate for non-driving tasks that constitute a significant portion of their working time (Belzer, 2000; Farrell et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2017). Other trucking industry-relevant corporate policies also induce LHTD chronic stress. The unique nature of the profession requires drivers to be away from home for weeks at a time, which effectively makes their worksites their \u201chomes\u201d for prolonged periods of time (Apostolopoulos et al., 2014). As a result, drivers are particularly dependent on the amenities available in these locales; however, these environments are notorious for lacking medical services or opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating (Apostolopoulos et al., 2013, 2016c; Williams et al., 2017). The mandatory prolonged periods away from family and friends, exacerbated by scheduling and financial pressures, lead to chronic social isolation (Apostolopoulos et al., 2016a; Williams et al., 2017; Jensen and Dahl, 2009) that is compounded by a pervasive lack of respect for LHTD that is manifest through their numerous daily interactions with general public and, due to inherent job requirements to act as a boundary spanner, customers, dispatchers, and even the government (Williams et al., 2017).",

As chronic stress results in the accumulation of allostatic load (AL) (Sun et al., 2007; Read and Grundy, 2012), workplace environments provide drivers with few means to cope with stressors in healthful ways (Apostolopoulos et al., 2013; Shattell et al., 2010). Instead, the coping behaviors that are exhibited, such as unhealthful eating and drug/alcohol use (Apostolopoulos et al., 2013, 2016a; Williams et al., 2017; Shattell et al., 2010), reduce the physiological capability of LHTD to handle AL in the long-term and perpetuate AL accumulation (Suvarna et al., 2019), leading to health afflictions including immune system dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (Suvarna et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 1997; Mocayar Mar\u00f3n et al., 2019; Bellingrath et al., 2009). Further, these stressors can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout (Williams et al., 2017; Kemp et al., 2013) and can induce unsafe driving behaviors, such as driving while fatigued, committing HOS violations, and speeding (Belman and Monaco, 2001; Farrell et al., 2016), that have been associated with roadway crashes (Lemke et al., 2016; Cantor et al., 2010; Khattak et al., 2003).",

However, these pressures are now combined with freight volatility, as overall trucking volumes are expected to slow down and demands for other goods, such as those related to manufacturing, have already declined (Garsten, 2020; Costello, 2020). Impending declines in freight volumes are expected to threaten drivers\u2019 wages and potentially their livelihoods (Garsten, 2020). Further, as the result of physical distancing mandates, worksite amenities have become even more sparse; as a result, many drivers have struggled with finding meals, safe parking, restrooms, and showers (Thomas, 2020; Norton, 2020).",

Drivers expose themselves to infection as they move in and out of areas with outbreaks (-- 9-1-1 [pr, 2020), and as they interact with various social contacts they pose acquisition and transmission risks to themselves and others (Premack, 2020; Apostolopoulos and Sonmez, 2007). These worries are made worse by the absence of personal protective equipment available to them (-- 9-1-1 [pr, 2020; Alcock, 2020), as well as a lack of corporate policies to protect them from infection, such as workplace physical distancing protocols and open and prompt communication about possible workplace infection cases (Alcock, 2020).",

            "text": "The potential consequences that these COVID-19 stressors pose to LHTD health and safety are numerous. One consequence may be strains on supply chains due to labor fluctuations. The trucking industry was experiencing a labor shortage before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (Costello, 2018), and the lack of PPE or other policies to prevent LHTD infection may result in walk-outs, absenteeism, and leave (Alcock, 2020). Drivers may leave the profession altogether due to increased levels of burnout or alienation as the result of these stressors (Williams et al., 2017; Kaynak et al., 2016). Supply chain strains may create greater pressures on the remaining labor pool to fulfill demand surges, resulting in a vicious cycle of even greater LHTD chronic stress. Increases in chronic stressors may perpetuate another vicious cycle related LHTD health: Due to corresponding increases in AL accumulation, immune suppression may render them more likely to get sick if they are exposed to the virus, and cardiometabolic dysfunction may make them more likely to experience COVID-19 morbidity/mortality (Dietz and Santos\u2010Burgoa, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Caramelo et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Vardavas and Nikitara, 2020); further, COVID-19 morbidity and sequelae may perpetuate existing health disparities; for example, by exacerbating cardiovascular dysfunction due to damage to the heart (Li et al., 2020) and/or worsening metabolic dysfunction through pancreatic injury or acute kidney injury (Wang et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Hung et al., 2018). Because cardiometabolic dysfunction is associated with increased likelihood of sleep disorders, fatigue, and roadway crashes (Anderson et al., 2012; Kales and Straubel, 2014), the impacts of COVID-19 stressors may manifest as safety declines.",

However, prevailing research frameworks are grounded in reductionist and linear assumptions of cause and effect (Salmon et al., 2012) and pursue identifiable risk factors (Hettinger et al., 2015; Singer et al., 2017). This focus on variable isolation (Salmon et al., 2012) to tease apart the influence of individual risk factors is antithetical to understanding the dynamic, multi-level, and interacting array of stressors and downstream consequences that altogether constitute a complex system. Further, these frameworks tend to overlook both the macro-level forces that lead to the clustering of adverse outcomes in populations and the interrelated and potentially reinforcing nature of these outcomes (Singer et al., 2017). This means that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for LHTD cannot be adequately understood \u2013 or acted upon \u2013 in isolation from the inherently stressogenic context of the profession, the historical and ongoing forces that have induced the chronic stressors and health and safety disparities endemic to the profession, and the potentially reinforcing nature of these afflictions. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention needs theoretical frameworks that contextualize COVID-19 stressors holistically within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety outcomes.",

            "text": "In our view, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens to guide commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention. The term \u2018syndemic\u2019 is defined as the clustering, due to sociostructural forces, of two or more interacting and exacerbatory afflictions within a population (Singer et al., 2017). The dual emphasis of syndemic frameworks on the clustering of health and safety within populations due to macro-level forces and on the reinforcing nature of these afflictions can provide the grounding to allow foregoing COVID-19 commercial driver research to transcend the limitations of prevailing research frameworks (Singer et al., 2017; Mendenhall, 2017). This understanding can then embody the emergence of interrelated health and safety afflictions due to the endemic stressogenic nature of long-haul trucking, how they are continually shaped by the dynamic macro-level policies and forces that have unfolded over time, and how these afflictions may perpetuate extant disparities and shape morbidity/mortality vulnerabilities (Singer et al., 2017). In the case of COVID-19, those macro-level policies and forces that perpetuate disparities can be expected to similarly induce detrimental outcomes to novel pandemic stressors, along with a worsening of related endemic stressors and corresponding stress responses. The consequences can be expected to synergistically interact with existing disparities and unfold across heterogeneous timeframes \u2013 for example, short timeframes for consequences associated with acute COVID-19 infection and full recovery (e.g., temporary loss of labor supply), and longer timeframes for consequences associated with inadequate trucking company policies to protect workers from COVID-19 infection (e.g., workforce burnout and alienation).",

In contrast to the limitations of individual-focused, single-component or multi-component interventions (Singer et al., 2017; Tsai et al., 2017) that are most commonplace and most likely to be characteristic of foregoing COVID-19 programming, syndemic frameworks inherently inform large-scale public policy interventions that target macro-level drivers of disparities within populations, while also incorporating the presence of interrelated afflictions and vulnerabilities (Singer et al., 2017). As a result, these prevention efforts would constitute holistic multi-level interventions that both modify the macro-level forces that have led to the clustering of disparities and also address and treat health and safety vulnerabilities and outcomes at the driver-level (Singer et al., 2017; Mendenhall, 2017; Tsai et al., 2017).",
