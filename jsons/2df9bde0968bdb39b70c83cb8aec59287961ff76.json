Two host jumps from chimpanzees resulted in HIV-1 groups M and N, whereas two host jumps, most likely from gorillas, resulted in HIV-1 groups O and P. The virus infecting gorilla (SIVgor), is in itself likely to be a derived form of a host hump from the virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz). How HIV-1 was able to cross the species barrier is an outstanding question. At the macro-molecular level, insights have been made about the relationships between specific antiviral restriction factors and the ability of SIV and HIV to restrict them. Nevertheless, the molecular view of the adaptation process of SIV and HIV to their hosts across a series of host jumps is still mostly unclear.",

Rate deceleration events point at sites that became conserved in a specific lineage, and indicate a possible gain-of-function. We found a total of 137 rate deceleration events across the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny. The majority of rate deceleration events occurred in parallel to speciation and were mostly different across strains, indicating different adaptation strategies independently used by the different viral lineages. The rate shift distribution pattern found supports abundant adaption of the virus to the first stage of entry, followed by adaptation of the virus to host restriction factors. Surprisingly, we observed that HIV-1 group O exhibited the most rate shift events, and suggest that since the virus underwent two consecutive host jumps, from chimpanzee to gorilla to human, this entailed more adaptation on the part of the virus.",

Those viruses emerged from a clade of lentiviruses known as the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), which naturally infects a variety of non-human primate species. HIV in humans arose from several independent transmission events of primates SIV that resulted in HIV-1 groups M and N (from SIV naturally infecting chimpanzees, SIVcpz), HIV-1 groups O and P (from SIV naturally infecting gorillas, SIVgor), and HIV-2 groups A through H (from SIV naturally infecting sooty mangabeys, SIVsmm) [1] [2] [3] . The gorilla infecting lentivirus, SIVgor, is itself a result of a transmission of SIVcpz to gorillas. Phylogenetic analyses date the oldest common ancestors of HIV groups M and O to the beginning of the 20 th century, making this pathogen a relatively new one in humans [4, 5] . Similar analyses on SIVgor date the inception of this virus in the western lowland gorilla population to the 19 th century [6] . SIVcpz was also found to be a transmission from other primates, dated at roughly 1500 and leading to the two lineages of SIVcpz: SIVcpzptt infecting the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes of central Africa, and SIVcpzpts infecting the Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii chimpanzee subspecies of eastern Africa [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Due to genetic differences between the hosts, virus adaptation occurs at multiple levels: at the level of entry; at the level of interaction with the host adaptive immune system; at the level of interaction with host antiviral restriction factors; and at the level of viral recruitment of host cellular machinery for its own needs [14, 15] . Protein adaptations are reflected in the history of genomes and may be manifested in changes in the amino acid substitution rates of the adaptive sites, which are expected to be more conserved in the clade where adaptation happened, and less conserved in the other clades [16] . A reciprocal phenomenon where a position in one clade is less conserved than in others is also possible, and may reflect a loss of function or relaxation of a prior constraint. Identification of such rate shifting positions can thus reveal virus adaptation events, and is expected to promote a better understanding of host jumps in general and the HIV pandemic in particular.",

Here, we utilized the growing availability of diverse and full HIV-1 and SIV genomes to identify all sites in various SIVcpz/SIVgor/HIV-1 clades whose evolutionary rate changed across clades, possibly due to adaptation events. We demonstrate how cross-species transmissions are correlated with abundant evolutionary rate shifts and how known adaptation events are manifested in different amino acid substitution rates between lineages. Based on the rate shifts patterns, we suggest possible as yet unknown adaptation events, and highlight the relatively exceptional amount of evolutionary rate shifts observed in HIV-1 group O, possibly due to a more extreme host species barrier.",

In Figure 1b we mapped the percent of rate shifts in each protein observed in each lineage, corresponding to different virus speciation events. While rate deceleration distribution patterns differed between the different lineages ( Figure 1 and Table 3 ), one common theme was that all prominent branches underwent a significant portion of their rate deceleration events in the env polyprotein. The next two common rate decelerating proteins were gag and pol identified in all four highlighted branches, which is expected given that these are the longest genes in the genome. When controlling for gene size (Table 1) , a different pattern emerges: vpu seems to have undergone a disproportionate portion of rate deceleration events, in particular in the branch leading to group M. In general, rate deceleration patterns for accessory proteins seemed to be branch-specific: nef and vif consisted 29% and 14%, respectively, of all rate deceleration events in the branch leading to SIVgor and group O. Vpu composed 14% of all rate deceleration events in the branch leading to group M, and rev contributed 20% of all rate decelerations in the branch leading to group O. The branch separating SIVcpzpts from other viruses displayed a more diverse pattern with relatively less rate decelerations in the env protein and more rate decelerations in the nef, vif and vpu proteins. Parallel rate shift events in HIV-1 groups M and O. Rate shift events common to several HIV-1 groups are of special interest, since they may better reflect the species barrier and not lineagespecific adaptation event. As is evident from Table 4 , most parallel rate shift events of HIV-1 groups O and M (or at their closest precursor branch) were inferred as rate deceleration events, the majority of them in the highly conserved pol gene. Notably, the consensus amino acid identity in those parallel-occurring rate deceleration events varied between the M and O clade for all identified positions. Only a single parallel rate acceleration event was identified, in nef8 of HIV-1 groups M and O. This possibly indicates a relaxation of prior immune constraint as the ancestral SIV allele was maintained in many HIV-1 sequences. Rate shift events are often parallel to known macromolecular adaptation events. The intensive research around the HIV-1 pandemic and its sources identified several adaptation events of HIV-1 to its human host. These events include adapting to cellular variations such as differences in host receptor CD4; overcoming host innate immune restriction factors such as Tetherin (BST-2) and APOBEC3G; and of course, evasion from the adaptive immune system. We sought to evaluate whether the proposed rate-shifts agree with the known adaptation events.",

Tetherin is a fast evolving protein, and differs between chimpanzee, gorilla and human [22, 23] . In humans, a significant deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin rendered it invulnerable to the SIV's nef-based counteraction [21] .

In group O the virus adapted its nef protein to counteract the human tetherin, but in a less efficient manner than in group M [25, 26] . No anti-tetherin adaptation event is known to have occurred in the rare group P [27] . In gorilla, the nef protein adapted to encounter its host's tetherin but also maintained its ability to encounter the chimpanzee tetherin [28, 29] .",

In addition, in HIV-1 group M the nef protein was identified with three rate accelerations, possibly indicating the loss of function of its anti-tetherin activity. This is also supported by a reintroduction experiment of HIV-1 group M strain into chimpanzee in which M-nef readapted to chimpanzee host, as the mutations required for M-nef to regain anti-tetherin activity in chimpanzees (nef163 and nef169) were located proximally to nef157, one of the rate accelerating sites of M-nef identified in this study [30] . Numerous O-nef rate acceleration events were suggested as well, perhaps as a proxy for the loss of chimpanzee/gorilla anti-tetherin function. A preponderance of acceleration and deceleration events were also found in the lineages leading to the ancestor of SIVgor and O and to SIVcpzpts; it is currently unclear what these events specify. Anti APOBEC3G adaptations. APOBEC3G (A3G) is a broad-range antiviral protein that is packaged into HIV-1 virions, and upon reverse transcription adds C\uf0e0U mutations to the synthesized DNA strand, thus potentially creating nonviable genomes [32] . Lentiviruses use their vif protein to overcome this factor by degrading it as well as other antiviral proteins from the APOBEC3 family (such as A3F, A3D) [33] . A3G variants of human, chimpanzee and gorilla have been studied and the vif recognition domain has been identified at A3G residues 126-132 [34] . Of those species, gorilla has a different residue at A3G position 129 as compared to that of human and chimpanzee A3Gs and indeed the SIVgor adaptation event to the different host A3G has been demonstrated by [35, 36] . It has been shown that SIVgor can replicate in the presence of human-, gorilla-and chimpanzee-A3G, but HIV-1 group M or SIVcpz cannot replicate in the presence of gorilla-A3G, indicative of a gain-of-function in the adaptation process of SIVgor to gorilla [36] .",

However, we cannot rule out that the very high rate of evolution in Env, driven by the adaptive immune system [43] , have led to changes that \"mimic\" a rate-shift. Indeed when accounting for the size of the Env protein, it seems that this protein is less pronounced in its rate shift distribution (Table 1) Gag30 human adaptation marker. Position 30 of gag polyprotein has been suggested to be an adaptation event of HIV-1 to its human host, as it diversified from Methionine in SIVcpzptt and SIVgor strains into Lysine or Arginine in many HIV-1 strains [44] . Reintroduction of HIV-1 to chimpanzees resulted in reversion of this position back to the conserved Met of SIVcpzptt and therefore it was suggested as an adaptation event to the human host [44] .

We have shown that known adaptation events to the different hosts are supported by the unique rate shift patterns identified in prominent branches.",

This is most prominent in HIV-1 group O, where the rev protein was identified as having a relatively large amount of rate decelerations. To some extent, this may be interpreted as reflections of rate shifts in the overlapping reading frame of env [ Figure 2b and Table S1 ], but the possibility of rev rate decelerating in group O due to possible adaptation event cannot be ruled out. In addition, the relative shortage of rate shift events in O-vif raises the possibility that O-vif may also antagonize gorilla and chimpanzee A3G, as the closely-related vif of SIVgor.",

Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that group O had almost twice the amount of rate shift events, despite being a non-pandemic strain that remained localized mainly to infections in west-central Africa [45, 46] . This could indicate that the amount of rate shift events is not the determinant of a pandemic strain; it may rather reflect the relative height of the species barrier a strain had to overcome, as chimpanzee is genetically closer to human than gorilla [47, 48] . Furthermore, the lack of parallel rate decelerating sites in groups M and O of HIV-1 with the same amino acid for both clades may depict the independence of evolutionary processes on relatively different genetic background as those zoonotic transfers emerged from relatively divergent strains of SIV.",

Wain et al. initiated the first attempt to contrast SIVcpz and HIV-1 genetic sequences and identify positions that differ between the clades, as an indication for human adaptation [44] . This attempt resulted in the identification of gag30 as a Met in SIVcpz and SIVgor but basic amino acid (Lys or Arg) in the ancestors of groups M and O, and therefore was suggested as a human adaptation marker of HIV-1. The authors focused on identifying shared substitution events between the ancestors of groups M, O and N, hopefully representing vital adaptation events of SIVcpz and SIVgor to humans. However, adaptation to a host is in many times independent as demonstrated in the different anti-tetherin strategies used by groups M, O and even HIV-2 [49] . In addition, Wain et al. ignored the phylogenetic structure of the sequences. To the best of our knowledge, our study entails the first large-scale approach to detect adaptation events in the transition from non-human primates to humans, and relies on a robust phylogenetic modeling approach. We have discovered many clade-specific adaptation events in many proteins of HIV-1, SIVgor and SIVcpzpts, and have reported sites in where groups M and O suggested to undergone parallel rateshifts.",

First, the availability of full genetic sequences of SIVcpz and SIVgor is still low, therefore reducing the statistical power of the analysis. Indeed, we noted that increasing the sample size of group M sequences that are much more available, led to detection of more rate shifting sites (see supplementary Text). We expect that the availability of more SIVgor sequences will increase the amount of rate shift events that are unique in that clade, possibly revealing more important sites for this lineage. Second, the method that we utilized to identify rate shifts is calibrated to identify dramatic changes in the evolutionary rate along a lineage. Accordingly, it cannot detect sites where a \"content shift\" occurred, i.e. the amino-acid changed and remained conserved in two complementary lineages, since this entails only a minor change in evolutionary rate. This is partially demonstrated in gag30, where the rate of evolution changed mildly, while the content of the amino acid changed between chimpanzee and human viruses.",

This led to 2004 sequences of HIV-1 group M, 45 sequences of HIV-1 group O, 9 sequences of HIV-1 group N, 2 sequences of HIV-1 group P, 4 sequences of SIVgor and 29 sequences of SIVcpz. Two different datasets were constructed: (i) with a very large number of group M sequences compared to the amount of group O sequences, and (ii) with an equal number of group M and group O sequences. Due to computational reasons, dataset (i) included 200 HIV-1 sequences, most of them group M. In both datasets, the sequences were sampled so that the n most distant strains (in terms of genetic distance) were sampled. Due to extremely high similarity, HIV-1 groups N and P sequences were reduced to a single representative strain from each. The IIIB_LAI strain was added manually as a reference sequence. The results in this study are reported mainly with datasets (ii), chosen since it allows comparing the result from group M and group O. Additional sites found with datasets (i) are reported in the supplementary material.",
