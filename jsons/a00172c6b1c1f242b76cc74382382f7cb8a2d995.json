Genetic distances among individuals on the basis of 1,130 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) locus were estimated from specimens collected from 17 sites on Madagascar, 3 sites on Grande Comore, 3 sites on Anjouan, and 2 sites on Moh\u00e9li. We observed little variation in Madagascar and nearshore island samples (maximum 1.1%) and interisland Comoros samples (maximum 1.8%). In contrast, pairwise distances between different sampled sites on Madagascar and the Comoros varied from 8.5% to 13.2%. For 131 Malagasy animals, 69 unique haplotypes were recovered with 86 variable sites, and for 44 Comorian individuals, 17 unique haplotypes were found with 30 variable sites. No haplotype was shared between Madagascar and the Comoros, adding to previous morphological evidence that these 2 populations should be considered separate species. Cytb data showed that Rousettus populations of Madagascar (including nearshore islands) and the Comoros are respectively monophyletic and display no geographic structure in haplotype diversity, and that R. madagascariensis and R. obliviosus are strongly supported as sister to each other relative to other Rousettus species. Genotypic data from 6 microsatellite loci confirm lack of geographic structure in either of the 2 species. In pairwise tests of population differentiation, the only significant values were between samples from the Comoro Islands and Madagascar (including nearshore islands). Estimates of current and historical demographic parameters support population expansion in both the Comoros and Madagascar. These data suggest a more recent and rapid demographic expansion in Madagascar in comparison with greater population stability on the Comoros. On the basis of available evidence, open-water crossings approaching 300 km seem rarely traversed by Rousettus, and, if successful, can result in genetic isolation and subsequent differentiation.",

Further, such data allow for potentially contrasting phylogeographic patterns, with Madagascar being a large single island and the Comoros a series of small islands chained as an archipelago. Hence, this information should provide insight into the evolutionary history of members of this genus and their capacity and constraints to fly across expansive oceanic zones. Finally, Rousettus spp. are known to be reservoirs for a variety of different diseases and ectoparasites that could be important for domestic animals and humans (Calisher et al. 2006; Reeves et al. 2006) . To interpret epidemiological patterns, explicit phylogenies and phylogeographic studies of regional members of the genus are needed. The purposes of our study, which uses molecular genetic data, are to determine if R. madagascariensis and R. obliviosus are true species and, if so, to examine possible sister-taxa relationships; unravel phylogeographic patterns within populations of these reputed taxa occurring on Madagascar and the Comoros; and examine patterns of population demographics within and among Rousettus populations in Madagascar and the Comoro Islands.",

PCR was done in a total volume of 20 ml with 13 buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2.0 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 0.25 mM of each primer, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase, and 1 ml of template DNA. PCR cycles consisted of an initial denaturation at 95uC for 2 min, 30 cycles of 95uC for 30 s, 50uC for 45 s, and 72uC for 1 min 40 s, and a final extension at 72uC for 10 min. Samples were prepared for sequencing reactions by first incubating 5 ml of PCR product with 0.5 ml of ExoSAP-IT (USB Products, Cleveland, Ohio) and 1.5 ml of water at 37uC for 15 min followed by 80uC for 15 min. Cleaned PCR products were sequenced using primers used for amplification in a total volume of 5 ml (13 buffer, 1 mM primer, 0.2 ml of BigDye v3, and 0.5 ml of DNA template) and run on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer capillary machine. Resulting sequences were checked by eye for errors and contigs were assembled in Sequencher 4.8 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Sequences were checked for stop codons and deposited in GenBank (accession numbers GU228597-GU228771; Appendix 1). To test monophyly of Malagasy and Comorian Rousettus, GenBank was searched for Cytb sequences of other members of this genus, which resulted in an additional 57 individuals.",

Three separate routes have been suggested for western expansion of pteropodids into Africa, via a middle Asian-European-Gibraltar route, a middle-Asian, Middle Eastern route, and an Indian subcontinent-western Indian Ocean, east African route (Juste et al. 1999) . Phylogenetic relationships presented herein on western Indian Ocean, African, and Asian Rousettus spp. are unresolved and hence do not provide clear support for any of these three hypotheses. In other studies with larger genetic data sets but not including R. obliviosus Simmons 2003, 2005) , support exists for the Middle Eastern route with the Afrotropical clade composed of R. aegyptiacus + R. madagascariensis being the sister group to R. leschenaultii. Further geographic and species genetic sampling is needed, with the inclusion of new material of R. obliviosus, to have a greater resolution to phylogeny and patterns of colonization of this genus. Phylogeography of Malagasy/Comorian Rousettus.-No clear phylogeographic structure was found in populations of R. madagascariensis on Madagascar or R. obliviosus in the Comoros. Across the approximately 1,600-km length of Madagascar individuals of R. madagascariensis from extreme ends of the island and across numerous biomes, and nearshore islands up to 13 km from the main island, demonstrated complete genetic mixing. Nothing is known about dispersal patterns of R. madagascariensis, but on the basis of genetic data presented here, dispersal movements are large scale. A possible explanation for this can be found in the unusual phenological patterns in fruiting of certain native plant genera, such as Ficus (Moraceae), resulting in a local paucity of food for frugivores during certain seasons, forcing obligate fruiteating species to disperse (Goodman and Ganzhorn 1997) . This potentially could explain lack of phylogeographic structure in R. madagascariensis. Even more striking is that a similar pattern of no phylogeographic structure was found in populations of R. obliviosus on Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li, with open-water distances separating these islands between 40 and 80 km.",

Recent epidemiological work on R. madagascariensis sampled at Ankarana in northern Madagascar revealed presence of Tioman virus (Iehl\u00e9 et al. 2007 ). Further, the other Malagasy members of the family Pteropodidae, Eidolon dupreanum (Pollen, 1866) and Pteropus rufus E. Geoffroy, 1803, tested positive for other Paramyxoviridae viruses (e.g., Hendra and Nipah), indicating that these diseases have circulated among these bat species. Given the genetic panmixia of R. madagascariensis across Madagascar, on the basis of the phylogeographic studies presented herein, Tioman virus isolated from this species likely is not restricted to the northern portion of the island. Further, numerous other viruses have been isolated from Rousettus spp. in Asia and Africa, signifying the potential importance of R. madagascariensis and R. obliviosus as reservoirs or vectors of different diseases. These include Rhabdoviridae-European bat lyssavirus 1 and Lagos bat virus; Paramyxoviridae-undetermined parainfluenzavirus; Togaviridae associated with the Chikungunya virus; Filoviridae-Marburg virus; Flaviviridae-Flavivirus Uganda S; Coronaviridae-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; and the unclassified viruses Yogue and Kasokero (Calisher et al. 2006; Kalunda et al. 1986; Kuzmin et al. 2008; Pavri et al. 1971; Towner et al. 2007 Towner et al. , 2009 Wellenberg et al. 2002) .

Samples were analyzed from 3 nearshore islands (Nosy Be, Nosy Komba, and Ile Sainte Marie), ranging from 2.5 to 13 km from the main island, and a significant number of shared haplotypes between these islands and the mainland indicate that this species easily traverses these water expanses. The direct distance from Madagascar to the nearest island in the Comoros, Mayotte (where the sister taxa R. obliviosus is unknown to occur), is 300 km and to Anjouan (where R. obliviosus does occur), 390 km. The latter volcanic island formed in situ about 3.7 Myr (Nougier et al. 1986 ). Given that R. obliviosus and R. madagascariensis are sister taxa and share no common haplotype, this distance of overwater dispersal is sufficiently great to have been a rare event that subsequently led to speciation. Within Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moh\u00e9li, which are separated by a maximum distance of 80 km, no island-specific genetic structure at mitochondrial or nuclear markers is found, and these animals seemingly cross this water distance with some frequency.",

As far as we are aware, genetic sequence data are not available from these populations, but on the basis of allozyme variation, populations occurring on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are different from those on the mainland, and they have been described as endemic subspecies, R. aegyptiacus princeps Juste and Iba\u00f1ez, 1993 and R. a. tomensis Iba\u00f1ez, 1993 (Juste and Iba\u00f1ez 1993; Juste et al. 1996) . For R. amplexicaudatus in the Philippines genetic distances for populations on islands of Luzon and Mindanao, on the basis of Cytb sequence data, were ,0.71% across a minimal islandto-island distance of about 215 km (Bastian et al. 2001 ). In the intermediate area between Luzon and Mindanao other stepping-stone islands house R. amplexicaudatus. Sulawesi holds 3 species of Rousettus, including 2 endemics, and about 120 km of sea separate the coast of New Guinea and northern Sulawesi. Molecular phylogenetic data on the relationships and origins of these taxa are not available.",

This complete trajectory is over 3,200 km. However, if R. aegyptiacus is the closest species to the madagascariensis/obliviosus group, the distances of 300-400 km that separate the African continent from Madagascar and the Comoros are more reasonable for members of this genus to cross. Clearly, further molecular genetic work is needed, particularly with samples from east of the Sunda Shelf and Australia, to understand the evolutionary and speciation history of this genus across a much broader geographical scale.",
