We reviewed medical records of patients aged 1\u201326 years receiving CD19 CAR T cells [2] at our institution between 2014 and 2017. The majority of patients remain under our center\u2019s care for a minimum of 28 days after therapy, as this is the time frame when the majority of complications are expected [11, 12]. Each patient\u2019s lymphodepletion regimen was determined by the treating physician. Bacterial prophylaxis was not routinely prescribed. Patients with a history of prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were routinely started on acyclovir prophylaxis if not already receiving it. The type and duration of fungal prophylaxis were prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients were prescribed prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or inhaled pentamidine. Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) supplementation was recommended for patients with IgG levels <400 mg/dL. Empiric antimicrobial therapy was prescribed for fever and neutropenia. Further details of the lymphodepleting regimens and supportive care approaches for patients who developed CRS are in the Supplementary Data.",

Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of pre- and post-CTI factors on the time to first infection within 28 days after CTI. For all factors, only data occurring before an infection event were included. For each infection event, the ANC and ALC values from the day of the event were considered as dichotomous data points (ANC < 500 or no, ALC < 300 or no). When a value for that day was not available, the most recently available value was used instead. For both Poisson and Cox regression, variables with a P value of <.25 in univariate models were considered for multivariate adjusted models. Poisson and Cox models were evaluated for overfitting or underfitting and Schoenfeld residuals, respectively. Patients were censored from the study before day 90 post-CTI if they died, were lost to close follow-up, or received further lymphodepleting chemotherapy in the setting of relapse, repeat CTI, or as conditioning for HCT.",

Lymphodepletion with the combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine was associated with a decreased incidence of infection in the short term. Although this combination regimen has been associated with improved cancer outcomes after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in ALL [18], a relationship with decreased infection has not been previously demonstrated. In our cohort, those patients who received CAR T-cell therapy more recently were more likely to have received this combination lymphodepletion. These patients may also have been more likely to have received antibacterial prophylaxis or have received CAR T-cell therapy earlier in their ALL disease process. In addition, cyclophosphamide dosing of 3 g/m2 may have caused more bone marrow suppression than the combination conditioning regimen with a lower cyclophosphamide dose (0.5 g/m2). Unlike previous studies, we did not demonstrate a link between higher CAR T-cell doses and infection. However, our dose range was narrower than those used in previous studies in adult patients.",
