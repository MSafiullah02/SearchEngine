It tends to come during the winter season and often times swing across countries over the course of months as an epidemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality as the patients may develop severe respiratory infections, pneumonia, meningitis, etc. In addition to a direct impact of the virus itself, influenza also may bring complications such as bacterial super-infections and cardiovascular events that cause numerous infected individuals death [1]. New strains of the influenza virus can be transmitted from animals to human, and the virus often evolved rapidly over time, which makes vaccine development more difficult in general. On the other hand, because of continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shifts in the influenza viral surface glycoproteins, a vaccine formulated for one subtype of influenza maybe ineffective in the following year due to a new epidemic strain. Hence, human influenza viruses continue to pose important threats to human health in the modern society. Various prevention and treatment methods of influenza have been widely studied around the world.",

Thus, despite the utility of these antiviral drugs, novel antivirals are in demand due to the emergence of adverse effects and the increased resistance of new influenza strains.

The IC50 was approximately 3\u201310 \u03bcM in different virus strains, implying the future derivatives of roscovitine would improve the antiviral properties while maintaining the lower cytotoxic effects. We conducted the further experiments with A/WSN/1933(H1N1) virus strain. Compared with viral infection group, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was decreased significantly (Fig. 1\nb). Besides, the number of plaques, the expression of viral mRNA and fluorescent spots showed the analogous downward trend in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c\u2013e). Furthermore, at 12 h and 24 h post-infection, the expression of viral NP and PB2 protein were reduced obviously (Fig. 1f). Simultaneously, an obvious reduction in the progeny viral particles of the roscovitine-treated supernatant was observed by plaque assay (Fig. 1g).

The result demonstrated roscovitine could not prevent red blood cells from hemagglutination (Fig. S2a) nor H5N1 pseudovirus infection, indicated it had no effect on virus entry (Fig. S2b).

With the treatment of post-infection and entire-infection, the inhibition effect of roscovitine was improved obviously, especially post-infection mode, while had inconspicuous effect on the pre-treatment or pre-infection modes (Fig. S3), suggesting that the compound exerted inhibition effect after the virus entered target cells. As reported previously [8], one life cycle of the influenza virus was around 8-10 h, and was divided into three main steps: virus entry (0-2 h), viral gene transcription and genome replication (2-8 h) and progeny viral release (8-10 h). To explore the period of viral life cycle disturbed by roscovitine, Beas-2B cells were treated with roscovitine at different time intervals during one viral life cycle (Fig. 2\na). As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the compound could greatly lessen the expression level both viral protein and mRNA at 2-5 h or 5-8 h time interval, indicating it blocked viral gene transcription and genome replication stage. Because of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) playing an important role in viral genome transcription and replication stage, we conjectured the antiviral ability was relevant to interfere with viral RdRp activity.",

To confirm this, we explored the phosphorylation level of carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) to estimate the effect on RNAP-II.

The viral RdRp is one part of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Once translocated in the nucleus, the primary roles of vRNPs are to transcribe viral mRNAs for the production of viral proteins and to replicate full-length complementary genomic RNA (cRNA) for amplification of vRNA and generation of progeny vRNPs [10].

It usually takes 10-15 years on average and costs a billion dollars or more to complete a development process [13]. Therefore, it is indispensable to exploit alternative use of existing drugs that have been on the market and approved for indications on other diseases, as well as drug candidates under clinical trials. Roscovitine has been reported to act on a wide variety of cancer cell lines and induce apoptosis. Moreover, it is currently considered as a potential drug to treat neurodegenerative and retinal degeneration diseases, lung inflammation and kidney diseases. Besides, the compound was also shown to inhibit HSV and HIV infection [14]. Thus, it is regarded as an efficient potential drug candidate.

After virus entry in the host cell, vRNP complexes are imported in the nucleus, where transcription and replication take place. The vRNP complexes constitute the core of the virus and consist of RdRp, NP and vRNA segments, representing the minimal transcriptional and replicative machinery of influenza [10,16]. RdRp of IAVs is highly conserved among all strains and subtypes during evolution. As a new drug class for antiviral therapy in patients with influenza, the RdRp inhibitors are characterized by continuous effective activity and great patient compliance [17]. For instance, Xofluza inhibits viral replication by targeting the endonuclease function encoded by the PA subunit of the viral RdRp and was approved by the FDA in October 2018, which represents a novel mechanism of action being studied and approved in almost two decades [18]. In this article, we found roscovitine exerted the antiviral effect by targeting to virus itself, and as a competitive inhibitor, it could diminish the combination of FITC-m7GTP with PB2cap (Fig. 4a). PB2 subunit is one part of RdRP and plays a critical role in the initiation of transcription by binding to 5\u2032-cap domain of host pre-mRNAs, called cap-snatching process. The PB2 subunit cap-binding domain (PB2cap, residues 318\u2013483) is responsible for the binding ability and considered a valid target for development of new anti-influenza compounds [19]. VX-787 presents broad-spectrum anti-influenza activity by disrupting PB2 cap-binding activity [20]. Furthermore, the PB2cap antivirals may considerably minimized the emergence of escape mutants, which are urgently indispensable on the edge of a new devastating pandemic. According to this study, roscovitine might influence PB2cap function to exert antiviral activity by FP assay. Next, SPR assay was used to further confirm the result. And the binding ability of roscovitine was approximately 60-fold stronger with PB2cap than that of positive compound D715-2441, a PB2cap inhibitor we reported previouly (Fig. 4b and Fig. S5). Molecular docking in this study demonstrated that it bound to the cap-binding pocket of PB2 via the residues Phe-323, His-357, Lys-376, Phe-404, Met-431 (Fig. 4c), consistent with a part of m7GTP-binding residues [19].",
