Furthermore, at that time in Singapore, gowns, gloves and masks were not consistently worn by staff, and were generally reserved for those caring for identified suspected cases. During the 12 hours, there was disease transmission to one doctor, two nurses, three patients and a visitor (Box 1). Other cases -a doctor, a nurse and a visitor -remain \"suspect\", and second generation cases are beginning to present. A total of 132 contacts were identified for the 12-hour period, each person requiring varying levels of intervention from counselling through to home or hospital quarantine.",

His wife and two of his three children have SARS, as does a taxi driver who took him to work just before hospital presentation. The patient was a vendor at one of Singapore's largest markets. As the extent of our patient's cluster became clearer, there was major concern in Singapore with the identification of another market vendor and his family with SARS. The ramifications of spread within a crowded market place prompted the unprecedented move by health authorities to place 2500 individuals on home quarantine orders for 10 days. The value of quarantine is an ongoing debate, but it is one of the few measures that can be taken during an infectious disease outbreak. 4 Instituting this Preventing local transmission of SARS: lessons from Singapore Clinical record At 11:30 on 8 April 2003, a 64-year-old man presented to the National University Hospital emergency department (ED) complaining of light headedness for 3 days, and dry cough and body aches for 2 days. His general practitioner had recorded a temperature of 37.7 \u040aC. On further enquiry in the ED, he described mild dyspnoea and palpitations. For over 40 years, he had smoked 25 cigarettes a day, and had consumed at least 100 g of alcohol per day. He gave a history of hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic atrial fibrillation. Regular medications included isosorbide dinitrate, aspirin, digoxin and candesartan. He had not travelled out of Singapore recently, nor did he report contact with anyone suspected of having SARS.",

His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and nonspecific bibasal infiltrates ( Figure 1 ). Arterial blood gas measurement revealed a pH of 7.39, PO2 of 61 mmHg, PCO2 of 31 mmHg and an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 91%, on an oxygen mask delivering a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) of 35%. He was assessed as having cardiac failure and admitted to an open, shared ward at 15:00. Admission blood results included a normal total white-cell count (9.3 x 10 9 /L), but lymphopenia (0.63 x 10 9 /L), and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 1770 U/L (normal range, < 700 U/L). Other measured parameters gave unremarkable results, but in hindsight these abnormalities may have been early pointers to the ultimate diagnosis. 1, 2 Within hours of admission to the ward the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. Although consistently afebrile during this period, respiratory distress and worsening hypoxia ensued, with SaO2 at 91% on a \"non-rebreather\" mask with FiO2 close to 100%. Echocardiography showed good ventricular function, inconsistent with heart failure. At 23:30, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 hours after presentation a temperature of 37.7\u040aC was noted. Three hours later, because of further respiratory deterioration, he was intubated ( Figure 2 ). He was transferred to the designated SARS hospital, and died on 12 April. The diagnosis was confirmed later when SARS coronavirus was identified in a throat swab on PCR testing, using primers developed by the Bernhard Nocht Institute. 3 Postmortem examination showed \"solid lungs\" (> 1 kg each). Haemorrhagic infarcts were seen macroscopically. Microscopy showed diffuse alveolar damage, with inflammation and fibrous changes of the alveolar walls. The alveolar damage was not uniform in all parts of the lungs, but showed some temporal phasing; ie, severe damage was interspersed with an intermediate degree of damage and some relatively normal alveolar air sacs. Postmortem lung tissue specimens were also positive for SARS coronavirus.",

Our patient's other medical problems, including excess alcohol consumption and cardiac disease, may have contributed to the absence of fever. It is also possible that patients with such fulminant disease may be relatively immunocompromised, impairing their ability to mount a fever. Most certainly, and with the benefit of hindsight, our patient had fulminant disease, progressing from being \"comfortable\" to respiratory failure requiring intubation in 15 hours. It is probable that he had a high viral load, which would explain the rapid deterioration in his condition as well as his infectivity.",

At NUH, any patient with fever or respiratory symptoms or a chest x-ray abnormality not otherwise explained is initially admitted to one of our newly created \"fever wards\". In the first 4 weeks of our engagement with SARS, there have been 394 admissions (including 65 staff) to these wards, with 23 individuals (4.3%) referred as suspect or probable SARS cases.

Every reasonable avenue must be pursued to keep Australia SARS free for as long as possible.Addendum : At the time of publication, one of the sons of the Index patient has died from SARS and another patient from the same ward has become a probable SARS case, with an onset of symptoms 14 days after exposure (April 22), raising concerns over a prolonged incubation or an unidentified intermediate infection.The son of the husband and wife infected via the ED is also now a probable SARS case.
