            "text": "A novel coronavirus newly named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] is responsible for the recent pneumonia outbreak that started in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Different from both the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 is a brand new member of enveloped RNA coronaviruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) infecting humans [2]. Although the majority of cases were reported to be related to the Huanan Seafood Market, the source of the virus is still unclear [3]. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020 [1]. As of 11 p.m. on February 15, 2020, Chinese authorities have reported 56,563 confirmed cases and 8969 suspected cases, including 1524 deaths in mainland China. Among them, Wuhan City has the largest number of 34,256 confirmed cases with 1123 deaths [4]. In addition, 515 cases have been confirmed in other countries all over the world. There is increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission in hospitals and among family members; the rate of severe cases was reported to have reached 26%, and the mortality rate has reached 4.3% by the latest study [5]. Asymptomatic infectious individuals can also be a source of infection according to the latest version of the guidelines [6]. A previous study [7] indicated CT has a higher sensitivity (97%) than RT-PCR results (30\u201360%) for COVID-19 pneumonia. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, CT is especially important for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and the judgment of the degree of disease. Although several studies have described the CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia [8\u201310], so far, there is still a lack of large-sample CT imaging studies and follow-up observation. In this study, we collected 100 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients, including 84 cases with CT follow-up scan, to describe the CT imaging features and evolution of this disease.",

Both lungs were divided into the upper zone (from the apex to above the carina level), middle zone (from the carina to the inferior pulmonary vein), and the lower zone (below the inferior pulmonary vein); then, a vertical line crossing the midpoint of the diaphragm in sagittal position was used to divide each lung into two parts: anterior and posterior parts. Finally, each lung was divided into 6 zones altogether, namely the upper anterior zone, the upper posterior zone, the middle anterior zone, the middle posterior zone, the lower anterior zone, and the lower posterior zone. The involvement scale in each lung zone was scored based on the following criteria: score 0 (no involvement), score 1 (< 25% involvement), score 2 (25% to less than 50% involvement), score 3 (50% to less than 75% involvement), and score 4 (> 75% involvement). The CT scores were also assessed by the three radiologists mentioned before by consensus. The scores were recorded and summed for different lung regions (such as the left and right lung; bilateral upper, middle, and lower zone; bilateral anterior and posterior zones), with a maximum score of 48.",

In the advanced stage, GGO showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05), GGO plus reticular pattern showed a significant increase (p < 0.05), GGO plus consolidation (30.1%) showed a decreasing trend, and pleural effusion (12.8%) significantly developed compared with the early rapid progressive stage (2.3%) (p < 0.05). In the absorption stage, GGO plus consolidation (9.1%) showed a sharp decrease (p < 0.05), consolidation (9.1%) and GGO plus reticular pattern (66.2%) showed a decreasing trend compared with the first two stages, and GGO (22.1%) kept the same level as that of the advanced stage.

We found 13 signs on CT imaging altogether, which were partially similar to the previous study but more comprehensive and detailed, including GGO, consolidation, GGO plus consolidation, GGO plus reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, microvascular dilation, air bronchogram, subpleural transparent line, thickening of the pleura, pleural retraction, pleural effusion, subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips, taking into account the signs inside the lesions (vacuole sign, microvascular dilation, air bronchogram) and the sign of pleural involvement. Also, we found that the lung abnormalities tended to be predominantly distributed in the peripheral zone, middle and lower zone, and posterior zone in bilateral lungs. The peripheral distribution may be due to the fact that the virus is more likely to invade bronchioles and alveoli, causing inflammatory reactions which need the participation of immune cells; the distribution of blood vessels and lymphatics rich in immune cells is more abundant in the peripheral and lower areas, so the lesions tended to distribute in the peripheral and lower area of the lungs.",

As the disease progressed, both the parenchyma and interstitium involvement evolved, manifested as the intensity of the previous abnormalities increasing, GGO turned into GGO plus reticular pattern, and GGO plus reticular pattern turned into consolidation, so the vacuolar sign was the most prominent in this advanced stage; also, pleural effusion developed in a small proportion of the cases. The vacuolar sign may be due to the inhomogeneous involvement and incomplete filling of alveoli, it was characteristic especially during the advanced stage. Meanwhile, some lesions began to absorb. The intensity of the previous abnormalities decreased; GGO plus consolidation, consolidation, and GGO plus reticular pattern all decreased, and the repairing signs continued increasing, including the subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips. Each lung abnormality had its own course of change, so some patients showed an asynchronous change of lung abnormality during the course, with part of the abnormality absorption and part of abnormality progressed.",

We found the CT findings of these 4 patients were similar to the other cases, indicating that CT scan was more sensitive than RT-PCR results; this finding was consistent with some previous reports [7]. A representative case is shown in Fig. 6. This phenomenon is also mentioned in a recent case report [18]. This may be related to the viral load of the lower respiratory tract secretion in patients with a different course of disease, or nonstandard sampling operation for pharyngeal swab, or it may be related to the existence of a certain degree of false-negative rate of the RT-PCR test. This suggested that CT may be more sensitive and detect lesions earlier than the present RT-PCR test for COVID-19 nucleic acid. This also suggested that there may be a proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with negative COVID-19 nucleic acid result when lung abnormalities already existed on CT imaging; the establishment of diagnostic criteria should take these patients into account.",
