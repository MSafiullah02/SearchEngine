Patients with RSV URI received high dose intermittently (6 g/day, 60 mg/mL for 2 hours every 8 hours) or low dose continuously (6 g/day, 20 mg/mL for 18 hours/day) ribavirin at the discretion of the attending physician, with or without immunoglobulin or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fusion protein of RSV, palivizumab. Use of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and palivizumab at the time of RSV infection was also analyzed. Steroids were given to patients with acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and IVIG was given mainly for GVHD prophylaxis and low immunoglobulin levels (maximum 500 mg/kg/week). After January 1993, routine IVIG administration was discontinued. Only patients who signed a consent allowing retrospective research (>95%) were included in the study, and the study was approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board.",

Grades 2\u20134 acute GVHD was considered present if it was diagnosed before or up to 2 days after the diagnosis of upper RSV infection. Patients who received an autologous or syngeneic transplant were categorized separately for analysis of acute GVHD as a risk factor for progression. The antibody levels were classified according to RSV subtype. All covariates with at least 90% complete data were candidates for the primary analysis via multiple logistic regression models. A variable was retained in the multivariable model if its univariate association with progression resulted in a P value \u2264 .1. Ribavirin treatment was retained in all models because it was a predictor of interest.

RSV disease progression is not universal, with observed rates of progression ranging from 0% up to 60% (mean 38%) [10, 20, 21]. The identification of risk factors associated with progression and assessment of potential treatment modalities are important when caring for these patients. This study was designed to determine the significance of viral subtype, type-specific neutralizing antibodies and other previously untested factors that could be associated with progression to lower respiratory tract disease. We found that smoking, conditioning with high-dose TBI, and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) \u2264100/mm3 at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with progression (Table 2), whereas the viral subtype, RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies, lung function, and lymphocyte engraftment dynamics appeared similar between progressors and nonprogressors (Table 1 and 3 and Figure 2A and 2B).\n",

We validated this association in statistical models that adjusted for other important risk factors and defined, for the first time to our knowledge, a protective level of the ALC. In our study, we determined that lymphocyte counts >1000/mm3 at the time of URI onset were associated with complete protection from disease progression. Although absolute levels of lymphocytes appeared to be extremely predictive for subsequent LRD, lymphocyte engraftment dynamics had no apparent effect. A potential role of lymphocytes in immune reconstitution has been suspected as risk factor for RSV LRD development because severe RSV disease is known to occur more frequently if infection occurs before engraftment [22]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known phenomenon observed as clinical deterioration in the setting of infection in the face of immune restoration by antiretroviral therapy in certain individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23\u201325]. IRIS has also been reported in non-HIV settings such as HCT, solid organ transplant recipients, autoimmune diseases, or cancer therapy with multiple pathogens [26, 27].",

Because lymphocyte counts were found to be the critical risk factor for progression, we examined the effect of lymphocyte count changes on progression from URI to LRD to test whether progression to LRD was associated with increasing lymphocyte counts and thus a form of IRIS. The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28]. However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B), suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD.",

In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36]. A recent retrospective pooled review on management of RSV infections in adult recipients of HCT showed that treatment interventions (such as aerosolized ribavirin alone or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin, RSV specific immunoglobulin, or palivizumab) reduced the progression by almost one-third compared to no treatment [20]. Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URI did not show a beneficial effect [8, 10]. Overall, the importance of serum RSV-Ab level in protecting the HCT patient from RSV disease progression is not known, and there is presently no good evidence supporting its use in patients with RSV URI [37].",

Although we included clinical data from a large number of patients who initially presented with RSV URI, sera for RSV specific antibody test were available only in a subset of recipients and donors (less than half), and RSV virus subtype was also only available in 76 patients. Therefore, smaller effect sizes associated with RSV subtypes or RSV-specific antibody levels may have been missed. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine RSV subtype- specific antibody levels in HCT recipients with concurrent virus subtyping. In addition, this study examined the effect of immune reconstitution, although only by analyzing overall lymphocyte engraftment dynamics. We were unable to evaluate the effects of specific T-cell subsets because these data were not available, and there were no cells available for study.",

We also observed that ALC of >1000/mm3 was completely protective against RSV disease progression. The importance of lymphocyte counts and the lack C of importance of antibody levels suggest that a characterization of RSV-specific cell-mediated immunity is warranted.",
