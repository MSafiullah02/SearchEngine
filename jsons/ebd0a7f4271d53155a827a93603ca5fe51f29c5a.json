Among the widely used dsRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs have evolved as extremely powerful and the most popular gene silencing reagents. The key challenge to achieving effi cient gene silencing especially for the purpose of therapeutics is mainly dependent on the effectiveness and specifi city of the selected RNAi-targeted sequences. Practically, only a small number of dsRNAs are capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specifi c gene silencing via RNAi mechanism. In addition, the effi ciency of gene silencing induced by dsRNAs can only be experimentally examined based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is essential to develop a fully robust and comparative validation system for measuring the effi cacy of designed dsRNAs. In this chapter, we focus our discussion on a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that has been previously established in our laboratory. The system consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expressions. The effi ciency of siRNAs is determined by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporters with easily quantifi ed readouts including enhanced green fl uorescence protein and fi refl y luciferase. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this reliable and effi cient reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective RNAi-targeted sequences from mammalian genes but also implicates the use of RNAi-based dsRNA reagents for reverse functional genomics and molecular therapeutics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of posttranscriptional gene silencing induced by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that mediate sequence-specifi c cleavage of the cognate RNA transcripts and in turn trigger complete degradation of the disruptive RNA fragments, resulting in reduction or loss of gene activities [ 1 , 2 ] . During the processes of RNAi-mediated gene silencing, the dsRNAs are fi rst recognized and cleaved into 21-to 23-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes with symmetrical 2-nt 3\u2032 overhangs by dsRNA-specifi c RNase IIIrelated endonuclease, Dicer [ 3 , 4 ] . The produced siRNAs are efficiently incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to form a ribonucleoprotein complex that fi rst unwinds the siRNA duplexes and selectively degrades the sense strand of siRNA. The single antisense siRNA-coupled RISC is afterwards guided to catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage of homologous RNA transcripts at the site where the antisense siRNAs is complementarily bound [ 5 , 6 ] . Subsequently, the resulting cleaved RNA fragments are immediately subjected to exonucleolytic destruction by the action of exoribonuclease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 340, "end": 349, "text": "[ 1 , 2 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 611, "end": 620, "text": "[ 3 , 4 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1046, "text": "[ 5 , 6 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Originally, RNAi was identifi ed as involved in the response to exogenous pathogenic and endogenous parasitic nucleic acids [ 7 , 8 ] and also as participating in the basic cellular functions, including gene regulation and heterochromatin formation [ 9 -11 ] .

Moreover, the silencing effi ciency of siRNAs is dependent on the specifi city of the target sequences within a gene and can only be measured experimentally based on the inhibition of the target gene expression. In order to select functional and effective siRNAs, it is necessary to design, synthesize, and screen many distinct siRNAs, which is expensive due to the cost of chemical synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. Several previous studies have suggested that the secondary structures of mRNA and mRNA-binding proteins might interfere with the target site accessibility for RISC; therefore, the rational design strategy for selecting effective siRNAs is not fully programmable [ 30 -33 ] . In addition, extensive large-scale and systematic analyses of the siRNA-specifi c features revealed that siRNA might have sequence-specifi c characteristics associated with its functionality [ 29 , 34 -37 ] .

The described target gene-reporter-based siRNA validation system totally depends on the availability of cDNA clones, and this may limit the high-throughput application of the method. Besides, the chimeric mRNA of target genereporter fusion construct may encode an impaired fusion protein that exhibits a low reporter activity, which interferes with the screening and identifi cation of effective siRNAs. Recently, a reporter-based siRNA validation system has been published in which the validating system is constructed by fusing a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence, instead of cDNA, with a reporter gene [ 39 , 40 ] .

The easy and sensitive EGFP fl uorescence detection or Fluc activity assay combined with well-documented and easily analyzed reference protein, GST or Rluc, provides a simple and reliable readout for the system.

"Sequence-specifi c features for the selection and design of effective siRNAs. The mature siRNA is a 21to 23-nt dsRNA that contains a 19-nt duplexed region, symmetrical 2-nt 3\u2032 overhangs, and 5\u2032-phosphate (P) and 3\u2032-hydroxyl (OH) groups. The positions of each nucleotide in the 19-nt duplexed region of the sense strand are numbered. On the basis of currently established selection and design rules, an effective siRNA has high stability at the 5\u2032 terminus of the sense strand and lower stability at the 5\u2032 antisense terminus and at the cleavage site. In addition, the sequence-specifi c preferences at the following positions on the sense strand are important including the presence of a G (or C) at position 1 and an A (or U) at positions 3 , 10 , 13 , and 19base preferences at the sense strand positions 1 (G/C), 3, 10, 13, and 19 (A/U) ( seeFig. 2) [ 29 , 34 -37 ]. 1.

Select any 19-nt sequence containing more than three mismatches to any other gene in the same species and also avoiding any known single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by searching the non-redundant NCBI database at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ with the selected sequence. 4.

As compared with the inhibition levels of these positive references, one could easily evaluate the effi cacy of selected and designed RNAi-targeted sequences of interest.There are many strategies to build the profi le of a gene and its function. One of the best and simple ways to elucidate gene function is to disrupt or inhibit the gene and characterize the phenotype of resulting mutant.
