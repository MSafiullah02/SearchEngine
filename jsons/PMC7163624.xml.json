Host cells can initiate these innate immune responses by detecting viral DNA and RNA with a set of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including the toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) family and the retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptor (RLR) family, as well as cytosolic DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP\u2010AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), IFI16 and DDX41 1, 2. After recognition of viral nucleic acids, these PRRs trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFNs), which subsequently induce synthesis of antiviral proteins, death of infected cells and activation of the adaptive immune response 3, 4. These antiviral signals must be spatially and temporally orchestrated to achieve an optimal outcome for the host and much attention has been raised to understanding the signaling pathways and regulatory factors in the antiviral innate immunity.",

While TLR9 detects unmethylated CpG DNA species, TLR3 and TLR7/8 recognize double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA), respectively 5 (Fig. 1). Following ligand binding, the TLRs form a signaling platform in which distinct Toll/interleukin\u20101 receptor (TIR) domain\u2010containing adaptors are engaged. For instance, TLR3 signals via TIR\u2010domain\u2010containing adaptor protein inducing interferon beta (TRIF), and TLR7/8/9 rely on myeloid differentiation factor\u201088 (MyD88) 6. For the TRIF\u2010dependent pathway, the ubiquitin E3 ligase TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 3(TRAF3) is recruited and hence activates TANK\u2010binding kinase\u20101 (TBK1) and Inhibitor\u2010\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) 7. Activated TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 then phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 to drive the expression of type I IFNs 8. For the MyD88\u2010dependent pathway, TRAF6 is engaged to the MyD88 signal platform, leading to the activation of the kinase complex composed of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2. Activated IKK complex induces NF\u2010\u03baB activation, which induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL\u20106 and IL\u201012 6 (Fig. 1). In addition, Myd88 also facilitates IFN\u2010\u03b1 production by promoting IKK\u03b1\u2010dependent IRF7 phosphorylation, which is particularly important for the antiviral activities of plasmacytoid dendritic cells 9, 10.",

Cytosolic viral DNA is mainly recognized by cyclic GMP\u2010AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) that contains a nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain. Following DNA binding, cGAS synthesizes a second messenger molecule, cyclic GMP\u2010AMP (cGAMP), which then activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) 17, 18. STING is an ER\u2010located adaptor protein that plays an essential role upstream of TBK1 in the cytosolic viral DNA sensing pathway 19. Although some other proteins such as IFI16, DDX41 and Mre11 are also reported to be receptors mediating DNA\u2010induced IFN\u2010\u03b2 production in a STING\u2010dependent manner, only cGAS, which enzymatically generates cGAMP as a second messenger that activates STING, provides a clear molecular mechanism for DNA\u2010stimulated IFN\u2010\u03b2 production 20 (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "In the TLR pathway, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), EGFR and Src have been shown to phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3 to enhance IFN\u2010\u03b2 and proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages in response to poly (I:C) and LPS stimulation 27, 28, 29. Moreover, in the late phase of infections, the iNOS/Src signal axis retains TLR3 activation through Src\u2010induced Tyr759 phosphorylation to support sustained IFN\u2010\u03b2 transcription 30 (Fig. 2). However, whether and which kinases might phosphorylate TLR7, TLR8 or TLR9 is not known, though tyrosine phosphorylation of the TLR8 cytosolic domain is reported to be essential for downstream signal transduction based on a site\u2010directed mutation study 31. TRAF3 and TRAF6 possess important functions in antiviral signaling, but only recently have studies revealed that phosphorylation regulates TRAF3 and TRAF6 activation. In particular, the casein kinase CK1\u03b5 directly phosphorylates TRAF3 at Ser349 upon VSV and HSV infections in macrophages, which promotes TRAF3 K63\u2010linked ubiquitination and ultimately enhances IFN\u2010\u03b2 production 32 (Fig. 2). However, TRAF6 was found to be suppressed by phosphorylation. Mechanistically, the mammalian STE20\u2010like protein kinase 4 (MST4) catalyzes TRAF6 Thr463 and Thr486 phosphorylation in THP1 cells, leading to attenuated oligomerization and ubiquitination of TRAF6, as well as reduced production of IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 33 (Fig. 2). TBK1 undergoes self\u2010association and autophosphorylation at Ser172 after being recruited to the TRAF3 complex upon RNA virus infections, a process in which glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B) functions as an important physical partner 34, 35. By contrast, the phosphatase PPM1B removes TBK1 autophosphorylation to eliminate downstream IRF3 activation and IFN\u2010\u03b2 production in HEK293T cells 36 (Fig. 2). In addition, the dual\u2010specificity tyrosine\u2010phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) negatively regulates antiviral responses by inducing TBK1 Ser527 phosphorylation and subsequent K48\u2010linked ubiquitination and degradation in HEK293 cells 37 (Fig. 2). Activated IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 directly phosphorylates IRF3, leading to IRF3 dimerization and nuclear translocation (Fig. 1). Multiple phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues on IRF3 were detected in HEK293T cells by in vitro kinase assay and Ser386 phosphorylation is suggested to be crucial for IRF3 activation 8, 38, 39. Recently, a study demonstrated that PTEN, a known tumor suppressive phosphatase, unexpectedly promotes antiviral immunity by reversing IRF3 phosphorylation at Ser97, thereby driving IRF3 nuclear transport 40 (Fig. 2). In addition, the DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2010PK) binds with and phosphorylates IRF3 on Thr135, causing IRF3 to be retained in the nucleus and extending the half\u2010life of IRF3 transcriptional activity in HEC1B cells 41 (Fig. 2). Other signaling molecules, such as MAPKs, IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IkB\u03b1, are also regulated by phosphorylation and we note that several excellent reviews on this subject have been published 42, 43.",

Ubiquitin can undergo ubiquitination itself at its seven lysine residues (K6/K11/K27/K29/K33/K48/K63) or its amino\u2010terminal methionine, which generates different types of ubiquitin chains with distinct functions. Ubiquitin chains can be topologically classified into four types of architectures: homogeneous chains, multiple chains in which one substrate is separately modified by distinct chains, mixed chains in which a tandem chain contains two linkage types, and branched chains 54, 55. Different ubiquitin chains have distinct functions, for instance, K48\u2010linked ubiquitin chain often targets protein for protease degradation while K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chain mediates protein\u2013protein interaction 54, 55.",

For example, CYLD, USP21 and USP3 are shown to remove K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains of RIG\u2010I, thereby moderating IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN\u2010\u03b2 production 90, 91, 92 (Fig. 3). Moreover, the LUBAC complex, which is composed of HOIL\u20101L and HOIP, counteracts TRIM25\u2010mediated RIG\u2010I activation by sequestering TRIM25 to K48\u2010linked ubiquitination and degradation 93. MAVS also undergoes K63\u2010linked ubiquitination at K500, yet the E3 ligase has not been identified 94. Interestingly, a recent study in Raw264.7, HEK293T and BMDM cells suggests that K500 of MAVS is also K48\u2010linked ubiquitinated by MARCH5, a mitochondria\u2010resident E3 ligase 95 (Fig. 3). Perhaps a spatial and/or temporal regulation of K500 ubiquitination on MAVS is in place to control this. Besides, TRIM31 is shown to serve as a positive regulator of MAVS aggregation by promoting K63\u2010linked ubiquitination of MAVS at K10, K311 and K461 in HEK293T and BMDM cells, thus driving IFN\u2010\u03b2 production 96 (Fig. 3). The K48\u2010linked ubiquitination, often leading to protease degradation of target proteins, also plays an important role in the RLR pathway as the abundance of receptors and signaling proteins must be tightly controlled. Indeed, RIG\u2010I, MDA5 and MAVS are K48\u2010linked ubiquitinated and thus repressed by RNF125 while ubiquitin\u2010specific protease 4 (USP4) specifically removes the K48\u2010linked ubiquitin chain of RIG\u2010I, thus stabilizing the RIG\u2010I protein and facilitate RIG\u2010I activation 97, 98 (Fig. 3). RIG\u2010I is also reported to be K48\u2010linked ubiquitinated by RNF122 and CHIP, while another E3 ligase, TRIM13, catalyzes MDA5 K48\u2010linked ubiquitination and promotes its degradation 99, 100, 101 (Fig. 3). MAVS is targeted for K48\u2010linked ubiquitination by multiple E3 ligase including Smurf1/2, RNF5 and ITCH, which induces MAVS degradation and RLR signal termination 102, 103, 104 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, TRIM44 dampens ITCH\u2010induced K48\u2010linked ubiquitination of MAVS, thus facilitating IFN production 105 (Fig. 3).",

Moreover, the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a contributes to IFN\u2010\u03b2 production by maintaining high HDAC9 expression, which uncovers the crosstalk between epigenetics and post\u2010translational modifications in antiviral immunity 119.",

In addition, during murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (\u03b3HV68) infection of MEF cells, RIG\u2010I is also reported to be deamidated by PFAS, which converts glutamine or asparagine residues to glutamate or aspartate respectively 122.

A number of studies have highlighted the importance of SUMOylation in antiviral signaling. For example, SUMOylation of RIG\u2010I and MDA5 by the E3 ligase PIAS2\u03b2 and TRIM38 promotes type I IFN production and antiviral activities in the cell 126, 127, 128. cGAS and STING are SUMOylated by the ubiquitin ligase TRIM38, which prevents their K48\u2010linked ubiquitination and degradation, hence facilitating antiviral innate immune responses 129 (Fig. 4). In agreement, the deSUMOylating enzyme Sentrin/SUMO\u2010specific protease (SENP) 2 alleviates antiviral responses by deSUMOylating cGAS, STING and IRF3 129 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, TBK1 K694 SUMOylation contributes to its antiviral activities as K694 mutated TBK1 presents enforced interaction with TANK1, a known negative regulator of TBK1 130 (Fig. 4). The E3 ligase responsible for TBK1 SUMOylation has not been identified yet, but at least it is known that the adenoviral protein Gam1 inhibits SUMOylation of TBK1 130. Notably, SUMOylation also represses antiviral responses via targeting the Ifnb1 gene promoter 131. It seems that SUMOylation leads to both enhancing and suppressive functions in antiviral innate immunity, depending on the substrate specificity.

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are serious infectious RNA viruses that cause grievous economic and health consequences. The influenza non\u2010structural protein 1 (NS1) is known to act as a virulence factor inhibiting host immune responses. The NS1 encoded by human, avian, swine and mouse\u2010adapted influenza viruses can bind with human TRIM25 and inhibit TRIM25\u2010catalyzed RIG\u2010I ubiquitination 132. However, the NS1 from mouse\u2010adapted influenza viruses targets RNF135, but not TRIM25, to inhibit RIG\u2010I K63\u2010linked ubiquitination, which indicates a species divergence between human and mice influenza infections and immune responses 132. The papillomaviruses induce expression of the cellular protein ubiquitin carboxyl\u2010terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) in keratinocytes, which inhibits TRAF3 K63\u2010linked ubiquitination and subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation, as well as IFN\u2010\u03b2 expression 67. UCHL1 also promotes K48\u2010linked ubiquitination of NEMO, leading to attenuated proinflammatory cytokines production 67. In addition, a large number of viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV\u20101), Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus (KSHV), HBV, Epstein\u2010Barr virus and some arteriviruses, have been shown to block IFN\u2010\u03b2 production by encoding DUB motif\u2010containing proteins 133, 134. Given the distinct functions of ubiquitination in the same or different signaling proteins, further investigation is urgent to characterize how these virus DUB\u2010containing proteins interact with target proteins and remove the \u201cbad\u201d type of ubiquitin chains on specific residues. Apart from ubiquitination, the Ebola Zaire virus dampens IRF7 activity and IFN\u2010\u03b2 transcription via VP35, which increases PIAS1\u2010mediated SUMOylation of IRF7 and thus impairs the recruitment of IRF7 to type I IFN gene promoters 135.",

More detailed genetic and biochemical evidence is also needed for a full understanding of PTM role in antiviral responses.
