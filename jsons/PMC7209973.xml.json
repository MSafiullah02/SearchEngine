That day, Bj\u00f8rn Ibsen successfully tracheotomized, relaxed, and positive-pressure ventilated a dying, quadriplegic 12-year-old girl, implementing a therapy that revolutionized polio patient management, reducing mortality from 87 to 22%. Nevertheless, the key to logistically enable the ventilation of all severely paralyzed polio patients over weeks laid in the 600 nurses supported by 250 medical students, who would actuate the bellows at the bedside [2].",

In Italy, within a time-frame of 35 days and after 80,589 positive COVID-19 tests, 3612 patients require critical care and mortality has risen to 10.2% (8215). The developments in China and Italy have shown the incredible challenges health care systems face with this exponentially progressing pandemic [3]. In contrast to China, the distinct separation between international, national, and regional health care systems in Europe, coupled with the rapid territorial spread of COVID-19, makes a selective deployment of personnel resources to affected regions as well as a generalized quarantine impossible [4, 5].",

We believe that the key to success is focused training and a narrow framework of responsibility for these students; a nursing support structure is being created, not a replacement for trained intensivists.\n",
