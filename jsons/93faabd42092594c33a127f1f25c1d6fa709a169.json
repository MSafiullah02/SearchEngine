The mean age was 48 (IQR: 27~56) and 35 (IQR: 27~46) in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients, respectively. Eight (42.11%) were female in NCOVID-19 patients, and 9 (60%) in NON-NCOVID-19 patients. Serum IgM detection suggested that 2 (10.53%) of NCOVID-19 patients had Coxsackie virus or mycoplasma co-infection. In addition, 3 (18.75%) of NCOVID-19 patients had history of Chronic medical illness. The median duration from exposure to onset is 8 (IQR: 6~11) and 5 (IQR: 4~11) days in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients, respectively. In NON-NCOVID-19 patients, no viral RNA or DNA was detected for mentioned targets in methods section while Serological assays showed mycoplasma against IgM positive in two patients.",

In addition, sequential CT images from same patient suggested that the inflammation was rapid infiltration in lobes of NCOVID-19 patients(Figure A-C, D-E, F-G). In comparison, of 15 NON-NCOVID-19 patients, only 4 (26.7%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical features of NON-NCOVID-19 were patchy shadow or density increasing shadow (Figure H), except for one (6.67%) had multiple patchy and mottling shadows with partial ground-glass opacity (Figure I). Laboratory abnormalities of the patients On admission, except one NCOVID-19 patient, WBC numberings of the investigated patients were in normal range whereas most lymphocytes were decreased in NCOVID-19 (12 [63.18%] of 19) and NON-NCOVID-19 (10 [66.67%] of 15) patients. Increased ratio of neutrophils was observed in 11 (61.11%) NCOVID-19 or 9 (64.29%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients. Compared to NON-NCOVID-19 patients, NCOVID-19 patients had higher levels of aspertate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT) and \u03b1-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (\u03b1-HBDH). In addition, a proportion of NCOVID-19 but NCOVID-19 patients had abnormally increased AST (5 [27.78%] of 18), ALT (5 [27.78%] of 18), \u03b3-GT (8 [44.4%] of 18) and LDH(6 [31.58%] of 19). Abnormally increased \u03b1-HBDH was seen in 6 (75%) of 8 NCOVID-19 patients and 3 (20%) of 15 NON-NCOVID-19 patients",

NCOVID-19 or NON-NCOVID-19 cases were confirmed to be infected with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. NCOVID-19 was defined to be 2019-nCoV negative by PCR detection. For NON-NCOVID-19 confirmation, we collected a throat swab or sputum sampling every other day. The patient was confirmed as NON-NCOVID-19 if three consecutive real-time PCR tests were negative during first 7 days of admission. Real-time PCR detection for identification of pathogens According to the surveillance scheme of pneumonia cases with 2019-nCoV infection and the guideline of laboratory detection for NCOVID-19[12], local Centres for Disease Control and Prevention collected throat swabs or/and sputa from suspected patients, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen. RNA was extracted from those collected samples. Specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays were performed to identify influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) using commercial kits or designed nCoV rRT-PCR kit by China CDC.",
