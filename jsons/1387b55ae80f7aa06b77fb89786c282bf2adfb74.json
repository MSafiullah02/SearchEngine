            "text": "Detection of viral respiratory agents has improved in the last decade due to new molecular techniques and availability of monoclonal antibodies for a number of different viral species [Garbino et al., 2004; Legoff et al., 2005; Rovida et al., 2005] . Nonetheless, the majority of all episodes of acute respiratory infection have none of the pathogen identified in pediatric as well as adult populations [Griffin et al., 2004; Louie et al., 2005] . It is likely that the prevalence of viral infection is underestimated because of the large number of respiratory viruses that are eventually involved in respiratory tract infection. There is also a continuously increasing list of new respiratory pathogens, identified by molecular techniques that can contribute significantly to the burden of acute respiratory infection. Indeed, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), detected in 2001 [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] , is now considered an important lower respiratory tract pathogen, second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) judged by the incidence rates among infants and children [van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Crowe, 2004] . By the end of 2004, following SARS coronavirus outbreaks, two independent research groups reported the discovery of a fourth human coronavirus, that was named NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] or NH [Esper et al., 2005a] . Early in 2005, again the detection of a fifth human coronavirus, HKU1, was published by a research group in Hong Kong [Woo et al., 2005a] . Several reports confirmed retrospectively that these new human coronaviruses were circulating in different countries worldwide [Bastien et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005a; Woo et al., 2005b; Vabret et al., 2006] . Therefore, a surveillance program for viral agents was conducted from October 2004 to September 2005, in children hospitalized for acute respiratory infection in a pediatric department at the University ''La Sapienza'' hospital of Rome. A molecular approach using specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays to detect nearly all respiratory viruses including the novel coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 was adopted. The main aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of respiratory viral agents in children suffering from respiratory tract infection and to characterize the different species in their pathogenic role.",

Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children. One to 3 days after hospitalization, all patients underwent nasal washing, obtained with 3 ml of sterile saline physiological solution injected into each nostril and collected with a syringe. All samples were delivered on ice within 1-2 hr to the virology laboratory and on arrival, if needed, they were vortexed with beads to solve mucus. They were divided into two aliquots: one was treated for nucleic acid extraction; the second was sub-aliquoted and stored at \u00c0808C.",

HMPV were present in eight cases that were positive to both PCR assays we used; sequencing analysis revealed that they were all type A. Six samples positive in the multiplex PCR for hCoV OC43 and 229E were all confirmed by sequencing to be hCoV OC43. Sequencing identified and confirmed one NL63 case, amplified with both NL63 couple of primers in 1a and 1b genomic regions [van der Hoek et al., 2004] , but not with NH primers [Esper et al., 2005a] .

The peak of incidence is similar (January-March) but in the present study, some cases were detected also in June and July.

In the present study, more than half patients that have rhinovirus as the sole respiratory pathogen were affected by pneumonia (9/17 \u00bc 53%); in addition, it was detected in four children hospitalized for asthma episodes. Recent studies indicate that rhinovirus is responsible for direct infection of the lower airway epithelium [Papadopoulos et al., 2000] ; furthermore, it is able to replicate in the bronchial epithelium both in vitro and in vivo [Mosser et al., 2002] . Consistent with those reports, this study suggests the involvement of rhinovirus in cases of pneumonia. The actual proportion of lower airways pathogenicity of rhinovirus, following natural infections, remains to be assessed.",

In this study in Rome, only hMPV type A was detected, in contrast to the report that identified both types in the winter-spring season . In this study population, hMPV cases occurred in two peaks of infections, the former in winter and the latter in June; interestingly, in winter they were associated with bronchiolitis (children younger than 6 months), whereas in June with pneumonia (patients 6 months to 3 years old). Human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E are considered agents of upper respiratory tract diseases, including common cold; nonetheless, they are reported to cause more serious respiratory illnesses in children below the age of 1 year. In our coronavirus cases caused by OC43 serotype, five were affected with pneumonia and one with laryngitis, and patients were more than 1 year old. The child infected with NL63, hospitalized for acute respiratory infection, had a subsequent clinical diagnosis that met some criteria for attribution to Kawasaki disease. Obviously, only one case cannot contribute to the association of NL63 infection with Kawasaki disease [Esper et al., 2005b; Shimizu et al., 2005] ; in any case, this report confirms the circulation of NL63 in Italy, first reported when this manuscript was in preparation in Northern Italy, where it was detected only in the winter-spring season of 2004-2005. It is well known that infants with severe bronchiolitis have an increased risk of developing recurrent wheezing later in life and viruses other than RSV and multiple viral infections may contribute to the severity of bronchiolitis. It was reported [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Semple et al., 2005 ] that dual infections with hMPV and RSV, or rhinovirus and RSV, confer a 5-to 10-fold increase of severe disease in children admitted to pediatric intensive care units. In contrast, other studies reported that co-infection with two respiratory viruses were not significantly associated with disease severity [van Woensel et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2006 ]. In the present study, dual infections were detected in 10% of virus-positive cases, mainly in children with pneumonia. Clinical data available from co-infected children did not show significant differences from other patients. Larger studies are needed to clarify the issue whether multiple infections could be involved with the severity of low respiratory tract infections.",
