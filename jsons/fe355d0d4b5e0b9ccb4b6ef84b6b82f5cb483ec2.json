Specifically, 214 confirmed cases in four provinces were administered with this drug for three treatment courses between January 27 and February 5, 2020, with more than 60% of patients showing obvious improvement in symptoms and computed tomography (CT) manifestation, the remaining 30% being stable without deterioration (Ren et al., 2020) . As a result, the Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction was deployed in 4 mobile \"Fangcang\" hospitals in the epicenter city, Wuhan, which were temporary hospitals to quarantine mild cases. This decoction showed satisfactory efficacy, with nearly all the patients recovering from the symptoms of fever, fatigue and cough, according to the data collected in 66 designated medical institutions in 10 provinces (Stated by National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, http://www.satcm.gov.cn).",

A cytokine storm, a term initially proposed in 1993 (Ferrara, 1993) , is considered to be an important signal for the transformation from ordinary patients to progress to severe and critically ill, and it is also the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which are the leading causes of COVID-19 death (Zhang, 2020b) . A direct suppression on the lung inflammatory response seems warranted as the cytokine storm may be relieved after inflammatory therapy. Previous studies had demonstrated the benefits of anti-inflammatory agents in lung diseases. Drugs that target inflammation have been shown to slow the decline in lung function and improve survival (Konstan, Hernandes, Xu & Griendling, 2018) . When the balance is broken by inflammatory factors, the body will produce an oxidative stress response, leading to cell oxidative damage and development of multi-system diseases (Kruk, Aboul-Enein, Kladna & Bowser, 2019; Sies, 2015) . Oxidative stress in turn activates multiple signaling pathways to induce inflammation, such as activation of NF-\u03baB and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), further promoting the maturation of pro-inflammatory factors (Ahmad & Ahsan, 2020) . Vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, has been demonstrated to play a role in lowing the incidence of pneumonia in several controlled trial with human subjects (Hemila, 2017) .",

            "text": "A large body of researches suggest that many polysaccharides possess anti-oxidative properties (Yu et al., 2018) , which may be critical to their multiple pharmacological activities. Bupleurum polysaccharides have been demonstrated to exert definite protective effects in murine lung-injury models (Cheng, Song, Li, Di, Xie, Di, Li, Cheng, Zhang & Chen, 2012) . Specifically, this kind of polysaccharide can reduce the degree of acute lung injury by reducing the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (Xie et al., 2012) . Ephedra polysaccharide can significantly increase the activity of SOD and reduce the production of MDA, thereby protecting the liver from free radical and lipid peroxidation damage on hyperlipidemic mice (Fan, Li, Yin, Zhang, Xu, Shi, Li, Zhou & Zhou, 2015) . Glycyrrhiza polysaccharide has significant ability to scavenge hydroxyl, superoxide radical and DPPH radicals in vitro, and also enhances the SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAOC activities in vivo (Hong et al., 2009; Zhang, Yu, Liang & Chen, 2015b) . It was shown that glycyrrhiza polysaccharide with lower molecular weight and higher ratio of glucose exhibited more effective antioxidant activities at the same concentration (Zhang, Yu, Liang & Chen, 2015a) . This phenomenon may be explained as a high molecular weight polysaccharide possesses a high viscosity, which may have great influence on its bioactivities (Chen, Lu, Cheng & Wang, 2005) . Two kinds of antioxidative polysaccharides, named PUP60S2 and PUP80S1, were isolated from Polyporus umbellatus, among which PUP60S2 showed higher antioxidative activity (He et al., 2016a; He, Zhang, Wang, Qu, Li, Li & Sun, 2016b ). This may be ascribed to more uronic acid residues and a higher level of branching of PUP60S2 when they have similar structures, as demonstrated that higher degree of polysaccharide branching is beneficial for exerting antioxidant activity (Zhao, Mao, Feng, Mao, Gu, Li, Li, Bao, Yang & Wu, 2014) . Poria cocos polysaccharide can significantly relieve ox-LDL-induced oxidative stress via the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (Tang, Nie, Li, Zhu, Zhang, Ma, Sun, Song, Zheng & Chen, 2014; Zhao, Niu, Yu, Xiao, Li, Zang, Hu, Siu-Po Ip & Li, 2020) . It was demonstrated that Poria cocos polysaccharides extracted by different J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f methods manifested different antioxidative properties, with microwave-assisted extraction possessed best antioxidant activity (Wang et al., 2016a) . Rhizoma Atractylodis polysaccharide acts as a potent antioxidant by reducing NOS activity, increasing SOD and GSH-Px activities, and decreasing NO and MDA contents in mice (Han, Gao, Wang, Wang, Shang, Wang & Pei, 2016; Liang et al., 2011) . Ginger polysaccharides also shows high oxidation resistance in several studies (Chen, Yuan, Wang, Qi & Cheng, 2019; Wang, Wei, Wang, Xu, Tang & Li, 2018) .",

            "text": "The composition of intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health and plays a vital role in maintaining physiological balance. Intestinal microbiota acts as a protective mediator during pneumococcal pneumonia by enhancing primary alveolar macrophage function (Schuijt, Lankelma, Scicluna, de Sousa e Melo, Roelofs, de Boer, Hoogendijk, de Beer, de Vos, Belzer, de Vos, van der Poll & Wiersinga, 2016) . It has also been demonstrated that modulating gut microbiota can reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia and enteritis (Bradley, Finsterbusch, Schnepf, Crotta, Llorian, Davidson, Fuchs, Staeheli & Wack, 2019) . Regulating gut microbiota is a major focus of current polysaccharide research. In a study on the effect of Bupleurum polysaccharide on diabetic nephropathy in mice, the ratio of phyla Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f which has been widely regarded as the marker of gut microbiota homeostasis, was elevated in diabetic mice but could be reversed by a supplementation of Bupleurum polysaccharide (Feng, Weng, Ling, Zeng, Zhang, Chen & Li, 2019) . In addition, the abundances of Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira were also increased after polysaccharide treatment, among which Ruminococcus is a probiotic that is found dominantly in healthy gut (Ma, Guo, Zhang, He, Kim, Zhang & Ma, 2018) , and Oscillospira may relieve inflammation by utilizing host glycans as growth substrates (Konikoff & Gophna, 2016) . Butyrate is an essential energy source that can influence microbial environment and protect the host against the pathogenic bacteria (Cani, 2018). It is noteworthy that Roseburia, a bacterium producing butyrate (Delzenne, Cani, Everard, Neyrinck & Bindels, 2015) , was also elevated after polysaccharide intervention. These results suggest that Bupleurum polysaccharide may alleviate gut microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, including proliferating butyrate-producing ones.",

However, according to the data collected by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, clinical practice in Chinese hospitals has reported that TCMs have definite therapeutic actions at the early stage of disease (Liu et al., 2020) , while common antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, Arbidol and Lopinavir/Ritonavir failed to cure these patients (Cao et al., 2020) . As the main component of the medical practice, TCM has been used for more than 5000 years in China in treating human diseases (Li & Kan, 2017) . It is a natural chemical library which leads to synergistic actions through multiple mechanisms. Modern medical research has demonstrated that polysaccharides are one of the main active ingredients of TCM (Liu, Sun, Liu & Yu, 2012; Zheng, Bai, Zhou, Tong, Zeng, Li & Shi, 2019) . In recent decades, polysaccharides extracted from medicinal plants are attracting increasing attention due to their significant bioactivities, such as antioxidant activity, anti-viral activity and immunomodulatory activities (Xie, Jin, Morris, Zha, Chen, Yi, Li, Wang, Gao, Nie, Shang & Xie, 2016) . In addition, they are non-toxic and rarely show side effects, making them suitable as medicinal candidates. This review examines the underlying actions of TCM in the aspect of polysaccharides. It would appear that the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and regulating gut balance activities of these polysaccharides play the most important roles in the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients.",

In the development of a novel vaccine, adjuvants are a vital component because they boost and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f accelerate the innate immune response (Xia, Xie, Yu, Xiao, Jiang, Zhou, Yang, Li, Zhao, Li, Zheng, Han, Zong, Meng, Deng, Ye, Fa, Wu, Oldfield, Hu, Liu, Shi & Zhang, 2018) . Producing vaccines with polysaccharides as the adjuvants is an innovative strategy. In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has made an effort to discover active ingredients from natural products for clinical use, due to their low toxicity.",

For instance, Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide improves the effects of various vaccines, by acting as an immune adjuvant (Guo, Xue, Wu, Zhao, Qu, He, Guo & Zhu, 2014) . Bacterial capsular polysaccharides vaccines have shown significant effects in the prevention of pneumonia and epidemic meningitis (Yu et al., 2018) . There is no doubt that the bioactive TCM polysaccharides are going to take important place in the fight against COVID-19 world-wide. However, each TCM prescription is a complex system and has multiple targets and links in curing disease, but that also makes it difficult to illustrate its function mechanism clearly and completely in a short time. More research on TCM polysaccharides should be undertaken to clarify the regulatory mechanisms, assess the possible side effects and conduct standard clinical trials. The insights provided in this review may help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The risk of heterotopic intestinal flora is increased if the intestinal mucosal immune barrier is in a vulnerable state, when microbiota dysbiosis makes patients prone towards secondary bacterial infections (Gao, Chen & Fang, 2020). COVID-19 patients show intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased levels of certain probiotic microbiota, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Even though there is currently no direct clinical evidence proving that modulation of gut microbiota has a therapeutic role in treating COVID-19, we suggest that modulating gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic strategy or at least an adjuvant therapeutic choice (Konig & Brummer, 2020). The latest version of \"Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia\"(\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e \u8bca\u7597\u65b9\u6848), published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, suggests using intestinal microbiological regulators to maintain the intestinal microecological balance in severe and critical cases.",

The effect of Chinese yam polysaccharides on intestinal microbiota was also evaluated in a model of antibiotic-associated diarrhea(Zhang, Liang, Jin, Shen, Zhang & Jing, 2019). In this experiment, the effect of yam polysaccharides on fecal microbiota was assessed by the colony-count technique, and the results suggested that these polysaccharides elevated the richness and diversity of bacterial communities. In addition, administrating yam polysaccharides increased probiotic Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli by 47% and 21%, and decreased pathogen Enterococcus and Clostridium perfringens by 8% and 27%, respectively, compared with a model group(Turroni, Ventura, Butto, Duranti, O'Toole, Motherway & van Sinderen, 2014; Wagley, Bokori-Brown, Morcrette, Malaspina, D'Arcy, Gnanapavan, Lewis, Popoff, Raciborska, Nicholas, Turner & Titball, 2019).Poria cocos polysaccharide is also a prebiotic in ob/ob mice, significantly reducing glucose-and lipidmetabolism disorders and reducing inflammation through modulating the gut microbiota(Sun, Wang, Ma, Bao & Liu, 2019). It alters the bacterial contents of 20 genera, with six elevated SCFAs-production bacteria(Lachnospiracea, Alloprevotella, Parabacteroides, Clostridum IV, Ruminococcus and Bacteroides) reaching significant statistical differences. Further, Poria cocos polysaccharide significantly reduces the abundance of the pro-inflammatory bacteria Megamonas and Proteus, by 120-and 101-fold, respectively (Byndloss, Olsan, Rivera-Chavez, Tiffany, Cevallos, Lokken, Torres, Byndloss, Faber, Gao, Litvak, Lopez, Xu, Napoli, Giulivi, Tsolis, Revzin, Lebrilla & Baumler, 2017).
