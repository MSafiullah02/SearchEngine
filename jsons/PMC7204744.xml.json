Several factors could have contributed to an increased likelihood of medication adherence, including near elimination of travel - patients rely heavily on public transportation in NYC and patients may skip medications, particularly diuretics, when they know they have long travel times. With stay-at-home orders in place, patients may be more likely to take their medications. Perhaps there is an increased awareness and desire to avoid the hospital, which may indirectly affect medication and dietary adherence.",

Our institution rapidly deployed virtual visits as a way to provide longitudinal care while also reducing patient exposure and slowing the spread of disease. The feasibility of this approach was recently demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial3 and endorsed by the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA).4 While this may be helpful in preventing readmission in the short-term, there is uncertainty about the mid- and long-term implications of employing this technology. Will GDMT up-titration suffer due to the limited ability to monitor blood pressure, heart rate and laboratory values? Will we see a rebound increase in emergency room visits and HF hospitalizations? How will vulnerable patients, such as the elderly, and those of lower socioeconomic status or residing in long-term care facilities be affected by this transition of care?",

From a physiological standpoint, self-isolated patients may experience a significant reduction in daily energy expenditure. It has been demonstrated by invasive hemodynamic monitoring that patients hospitalized with HF placed on bed rest experience the equivalent of a vasodilatory response with reduction in mean arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressures, and increase in cardiac output.5 Perhaps a similar phenomenon is occurring at home. Has matching between energy supply and demand improved and is this why fewer patients are admitted for HF?",

What about the psychosocial stressors of unemployment, child-care, and access to food? Will there be a rebound increase in restaurant food intake and subsequent increase in congestion? At this juncture, it is prudent to assume that we will see a surge of HF cases and we must prepare for this next phase of care.",
