To reduce interference during electrical\nmeasurements, the device was passivated with SU8-2010. Details of the\nfabrication of the COVID-19 FET sensor is provided in Materials and Methods. To confirm that the graphene\nsurface was chemically functionalized using PBASE, we obtained Raman\nspectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data (Figure 2B\u2013H). Figure 2B shows the Raman\nspectra of the pristine and PBASE-modified graphene surfaces. In the\nspectrum for the surface of pristine graphene, two major peaks (the G\nand 2D peaks) were observed. The G peak corresponds to the lattice\nvibration mode, and the 2D peak stems from second-order Raman\nscattering. However, the D and D\u2032 peaks obviously appeared due\nto the relative resonance of sp3 bonding, orbital\nhybridization, and a pyrene group in the binding of PABSE to the\ngraphene surface. To provide a visual comparison of the qualities of\ngraphene after modification with PBASE, we converted the measured data\nto histograms and mapping images (Figure 2C\u2013E). After PBASE was applied to\nthe graphene surface, the statistical data of the 2D peak position\nwere shifted to a higher frequency (\u223c3.27\ncm\u20131), indicating p-doping by the\n\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction between PBASE and graphene (Figure 2C).23,24 The mapping images also show\nthat the average\nI2D/IG\nratio of PBASE-treated graphene\n(I2D/IG\n= \u223c1.87) is significantly lower than that of pristine graphene\n(I2D/IG\n= \u223c3.61) due to existence of some disorder on the graphene\n(Figure 2D,E).",
