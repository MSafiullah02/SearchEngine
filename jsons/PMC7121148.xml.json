This criterion is frequently controversial, because (1) it assumes that only bacterial infections are the real cause of exacerbations, and (2) the administration of antibiotics should be a consequence of the definition, and not part of it. More recently, during the First World Bronchiectasis Congress held in Hanover in July 2016, an international (from Europe [EMBARC], the USA, Australasia, and South Africa) task force of 28 experts in bronchiectasis generated an agreed-upon definition of exacerbations of bronchiectasis [16]. Firstly, a review of exacerbations used in clinical trials between 2000 and 2015 was performed [1, 11\u201314, 17\u201331]. Secondly, a Delphi process [32], followed by a round table discussion, was used to identify the most relevant elements to include in a definition of exacerbations and to achieve a final agreement on it. Finally, the definition proposed included a deterioration in three or more of the following key symptoms, for at least 48 h: cough; sputum volume and/or consistency; sputum purulence; breathlessness and/or exercise tolerance; fatigue and/or malaise; hemoptysis, and a clinician who determines that a change in bronchiectasis treatment is required (Table 15.1).\n",

Less frequent potential treatment-related adverse events, such as QTc prolongation, tinnitus/hearing loss, and selection of macrolide- resistant non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) should be carefully considered when beginning long-term treatment with macrolides. In particular, 2\u20133 sputum cultures negative to NTM are recommended before beginning macrolides, since it is known that NTM infections caused by macrolide-resistant strains are usually more difficult to treat [79]. Conversely, other chronic regimens with oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or tetracycline, have been reported to improve sputum purulence, but do not show such clear benefits in terms of exacerbations as frequently as macrolides [34, 80].",

Numerous antibiotics have been developed in the past few years for inhaled administration (e.g., dry powder, nebulized solutions); these include ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, colistin, and tobramycin. Unfortunately, the level of evidence supporting their use in clinical practice is still controversial due to the fact that, unexpectedly, some clinical trials failed to achieve primary outcomes. For instance, inhaled aztreonam, which had shown positive results for CF [81, 82], did not improve quality of life (primary outcome of the LQ-B questionnaire) significantly more than placebos [23]. Haworth et al (2014)could not prove that inhaled colistin could significantly prolong the time to the first exacerbation in the overall population (primary outcome). However, patients who stayed with the treatment during the trial, showed a median time to exacerbation of 168 (65) vs. 103 (37) days in the colistin and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.038) [27].",
