The current shift in China\u2019s population from rural to urban areas is predicted to continue, with nearly 200 million moving over the next decade (Zhu and Jones 2010). Empirical studies of China show a strong association between economic growth and urban spatial expansion (Lichtenberg and Ding 2009). Recognising urbanisation's central role in further economic growth and social development, China will continue to give high priority to urbanisation in the coming decades (Chen 2007).",

China has experienced an epidemiological transition shifting from infectious to chronic diseases in a much shorter time frame than many other countries (Yang et al. 2008). However, the term epidemiological transition is only limited to the cause of death rather than disease burden, which was formulated by Abdel Omran in the 1970s (Abdel 1977). Typically, chronic diseases have been considered a public health problem only in developed countries and among the elderly (Yach et al. 2004). However, research suggests that chronic diseases affect a much higher proportion of people during their prime working years in China as compared with developed countries (He et al. 2005). China's epidemiologic transition can be captured through changes in the causes of death in the adult population. For men and women aged 40 years and older, the leading causes have changed quite dramatically since the mid-1950s, when vital statistics for 13 Chinese cities showed the top 3 causes to be diseases of the respiratory system, acute infectious diseases and TB. By 1999\u20132000, vascular disease and cancer had become the leading causes of death, with the major contributions coming from hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity and underweight. Rates of smoking and physical inactivity were higher among urban residents than rural residents. Underweight was less of an issue in urban areas (He et al. 2005). These findings indicate the rise in \u2018new\u2019 chronic diseases and the important role the place of residence plays in health outcomes and health transitions. Particularly, urban areas in some developing countries are moving through a nutritional transition towards Western-style diets, dominated by more processed and higher-fat-content foods (Popkin 2003; Popkin and Du 2003).",

Rapid urbanisation impacts on natural and built infrastructure, environmental health and human well-being (Zhu et al. 2011). In many countries, the urban poor even have higher rates of stunting and mortality than their rural counterparts (Poel et al. 2007). Some studies in China revealed that more overweight people and a high prevalence of hypertension in more unbanized areas have a relation to low physical activity (Poel et al. 2009). Urbanisation in China, characterized by large-scale rural\u2013urban migration and built-up area expansion, produced many urban villages where many migrants lived under poor health care and living conditions (Liu et al. 2010).",

However, few studies investigate the interactions between the three processes, and little attention has been paid to the following aspects which are of importance to policy makers and urban planners: (1) dynamic urban spatial expansion and its possible environmental and health effects and (2) the health effects at different points along the urbanisation gradient, not simply a broad urban\u2013rural comparison. What is needed is an ecological public health approach (Rayner 2009) which considers the interactions between the process of urbanisation including its spatial\u2013temporal characteristics, environmental change and human health. Such an approach adopts ecological thinking applying the biological sciences, with attention to natural processes, history and timescales, as well as the broad sweep of sciences devoted to human and social development. It attempts to sidestep the distinction between natural and human ecology and to consider their interdependence.",

Many researchers analysed the linear correlation between nighttime imagery and socioeconomic factors; the socioeconomic factors comprised population density (Sutton 1997), urban sprawl (Imhoff et al. 1997), urban heat island (Gallo et al. 1995) and energy consumption (Amaral et a1. 2003).

These conditions bring the risk of respiratory disease and injury, as well as facilitating the rapid spread of viruses (WHO-UN Habitat 2010). Furthermore, urban\u2013industrial spread is a major category of human-induced environmental change (McMichael 2009). Rapid urban expansion induces extensive change of land use and coverage. Wetland and arable land reduction are becoming major problems for China (Li et al. 2009). Loss of cultivated land places significant pressure on agricultural production, with some believing that accelerated urbanisation and industrialization will decrease cultivated areas to the point where China can no longer feed its people in the next decades. In addition, urbanisation increases the risk of soil pollution through waste disposal and acid deposition derived from urban air pollution (Chen 2007), further compromising food yields and food quality.",

Urban expansion is one of the major driving factors of land use/coverage change in China (Li et al. 2011), and these changes have extensive effects on local ecological systems by reducing biodiversity, air deterioration and contributing to water shortages. Accelerated urbanisation along with explosive economic growth has further worsened the shortage of agricultural land over the last two decades (Chen 2007), with possible consequences for food security and nutritional deficiencies threatening the overall health status of the population. Reduced cultivated land places pressures to intensify agricultural production, which depends on both the progress of agricultural technology and the higher use of fertiliser and pesticides. Such inputs have repercussions for the availability of safe food, and also of the price of food as fertiliser costs increase in line with oil prices.",

The percentage of population over 65 years old has been increasing in recent decades, and the transition to an older population will present the health system with major costs. China has 6 million patients with dementia and, with a rapidly ageing population, was estimated to have 1 million new cases every year (Qiu 2007). Family planning in countries with high birth rates has the potential to reduce poverty and hunger (Cleland et al. 2006). However, China\u2019s one-child policy, introduced in 1979 and implemented for over 30 years, has resulted in an increase in older people and a decrease in younger workers, as well as a sex ratio imbalance (Christensen et al. 2009; Grossi 2005). It is both urgent and necessary for China to solve its problems related to ageing, both for public health and for sustainable economic and social development.",

This is of great importance because disease prevention is less expensive than pharmaceutical and hospital-based care over the long term, and a healthy population is one of the critical pillars of social and economic development. In this paper, we put forward the types of data which need to be collected as part of any early warning, or monitoring and surveillance, health system. Importantly, it includes a role for disaggregated urban\u2013rural data, which, as the WHO points out, is necessary if governments are to counteract health inequities (WHO and UN Habitat 2010). By adopting an ecological public health approach, we show how making human and environmental health central to policy could lead to fairer and more sustainable urban systems.",
