The database contains International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses including present on admission information and ICD-9-CM procedures by date. Information is collected on all patients within all hospital treatment areas, additionally including patient demographic data and a date stamped log with quantity, cost, and charge details for all invoiced items, such as medications, laboratory orders, diagnostic and therapeutic services. Participating hospitals are geographically diverse, primarily nonprofit and non-governmental, and include community and teaching hospitals from rural and urban areas (1) . Fewer than one percent of patient records have missing data for most components, while fewer than 0.01 percent have missing data for key components, such as demographics and diagnostics information (2) . Currently, more than 375 studies utilizing the Premier Hospital Database have been published in peer-reviewed journals across multiple disciplines (1) . The Truven Health MarketScan Hospital Drug Database contains clinical data on inpatient episodes for all patients discharged from approximately 600 United States Hospitals. These records include admission and discharge dates, patient demographics and provider specialty, and specific codes for diagnosis, procedures, drug administration, and facility descriptors. This database has been shown to be representative of acute care hospitals in the United States (3) (4) (5) .",

The initial development set from the Premier database was split into two random sets of hospitals. An iterative review of a series of models looked at the residuals for each condition as factors were added and removed from the model. This process examined all possible factors that were present in at least 2.5% of the population and included those that were at least as large a factor as the difference between being 40 and 50 years of age. The same set of factors was then identified in the control set of the other half of the hospitals. The model coefficients from the two models were within the statistical uncertainty for each factor. Because of the size of the dataset and the small number of predictors, there was no significant risk of over fitting. This same set of model predictors was then applied to the Truven data to properly calibrate for differences that may occur overall from a different set of hospitals and different years of care.",

Risk of death increased with age, and the oldest age group (75-99 years of age) also had the highest observed frequency (24.5%). Of the admission diagnoses, the neoplastic diseases, including pulmonary and CNS neoplasm followed by metastatic neoplasm, conferred the highest risk of death. Of the conditions comprising each segment, a circulatory diagnosis with shock conferred the highest risk of death. This was followed by other (non-infectious) diagnoses with shock and septic shock. Conditions without shock, as anticipated, conferred lower risks of death (Supplementary Table E1 ).",
