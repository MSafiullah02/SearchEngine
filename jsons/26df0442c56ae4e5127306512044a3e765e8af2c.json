This will be useful for policymakers to decide on actions required for control of the pandemic and optimum utilization of healthcare resources in resourcelimited settings in particular. 25. Large scale testing and contact tracing was carried out. All patients were admitted irrespective of symptomatology and their close contacts were admitted in isolation facilities and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the guidelines were modified to allow home isolation of very mild/ pre-symptomatics COVID-19 cases. This initial phase presented an unique opportunity to elucidate the disease profile and outcomes among patients presenting with mild symptoms and those diagnosed on contact tracing.",

(9, 15, 19, 20) In our study cough and fever were the commonest symptoms, with former being more common. It has important implications because patients with mild cough and no fever may ignore their symptoms and not seek medical attention. Further, the frequency of these symptoms were much lower than reported in other studies. In a study from China, the reported frequencies of fever and cough was reported as 88% and 68% respectively, whereas in the United States it was 94% and 88%. (9, 20) It is in stark contrast to 35% and 28% seen in the present study. It may be related to the diagnostic strategy and admission criteria which is variable across countries. This study was carried out in early days of the pandemic in India when large scale surveillance, testing and contact tracing was carried out. All patients were admitted irrespective of symptomatology and their close contacts were admitted in isolation facilities and tested for SARS-CoV-2. This presented a unique opportunity to study the disease course in all infected patients irrespective of symptomatology.",

In a study from Korea, out-ofhospital cohort treatment of COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms reported disease worsening in 2\u00b73% patients. Patients with severe disease and underlying chronic severe medical conditions were excluded. (27) In our study, none of the patients had disease progression to moderate-severe disease. Up triaging was required in 1\u00b77% of the patients due to worsening of the underlying comorbidities. This data is reassuring that COVID-19 patients with mild disease or asymptomatic infections can be managed outside hospital settings.This will help in optimum utilization of healthcare facilities in resource-limited settings facing COVID-19 pandemic. This will also free up precious hospital beds for management of patients with moderate to severe disease. This study has several limitations. First, there is sparse literature on mild cases and our patients were younger compared to other reported studies, so direct comparison of clinical manifestations and disease progression is to be done cautiously. However, our patients had a significant burden of comorbidities for their age, which is an important risk factor for severe disease. Secondly, this being a retrospective study there are inherent limitations. Daily symptom screen data was lacking in many cases leading to .
