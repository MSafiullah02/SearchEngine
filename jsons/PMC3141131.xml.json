Following the recent worldwide H1N1 influenza outbreak, sales of antiviral drugs (especially oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu)) are expected to vastly increase during the 2009 \u2013 2010 period. In 1990, there were only five licensed antiviral drugs; today this figure has grown to over 60.[1] However, most of these drugs are targeted at human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and various herpes viruses. There is an urgent need to develop therapies against the myriad of viral diseases for which no therapies currently exist. As most medically important human viruses are RNA viruses,[2] the discovery of agents directed against RNA viruses is particularly important.",

Currently, most assays are based on virus-induced cytopathic effect reduction assays (CPE-RA)[3\u20135] or genomic/subgenomic replicon-based assays.[6\u20138] Although the CPE-RA and replicon-based assays are specific for viruses and cell lines, they are expensive, time consuming, and require specialized equipment and training. Both these methods involve growing cell lines for several days, inoculating them with the test virus, treating them with the potential antiviral agent, and after several more days, checking for a response (eg. reduction of the cytopathic effect or inhibition of viral replication). The time required for these assays and/or their low throughput nature limit their use for initial screening of large sample groupings. Instead, CPE-RA and genomic/subgenomic replicon-based assays are more suited for directed antiviral analysis.",

It is readily cultivatable in titres up to 1012 pfu/ml and enumeration is rapid (less than 24 hours), and it is inexpensive. Furthermore, MS2 in not pathogenic to humans and can therefore be tested in high numbers without the need for additional safety measures. This makes MS2 bacteriophage a useful simulant in place of small, human infective RNA viruses (eg., Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and equine encephalitis alphaviruses).",

To test this assay we chose to examine plants that have previously been shown to inhibit viral growth to determine whether antiviral activity could also be detected in the plaque reduction assay. Recent studies have shown that Camellia sinensis (tea) inhibits influenza virus replication in the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line,[13] blocks attachment of HIV in T cells,[14] and has been reported to be effective in the treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced genital warts.[15] A previous study[16] found Scaevola spinescens leaves to be capable of inhibiting greater than 25% of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) production. Similarly, Aloe barbadensis Miller extracts have also been shown to inhibit CMV production in human cell lines.[17] Furthermore, aloe emodin, purified from A. barbadensis, has been shown to inactivate herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, the varicella-zoster virus, pseudorabies virus, and influenza virus.[18] In this report, we outline the use of the MS2 plaque reduction assay to detect antiviral activity in C. sinensis, S. spinescens extracts, and A. barbadensis juice.",

This is an interesting finding as previous reports have described MS2 bacteriophage as being specific to F+ E. coli. MS2 production studies using the other bacterial species were initially included as negative controls. The lysis in the B. cereus and S. aureus cultures indicates that MS2 may not be as specific as previously reported. Moreover, increased lysis in the B. cereus and S. aureus cultures indicates that these bacteria are more sensitive to MS2 lysis than are F+ E. coli, and could therefore be used to develop a more sensitive bioassay than the current assay used to measure plaque reduction activity of water samples.",

As seen in Figure 2, culturing MS2 in F- E. coli (lane B) resulted in the production of no MS2 cDNA. In contrast, MS2 phage cDNA was clearly evident in the samples synthesized against the MS2/ F+ E. coli culture. Interestingly, cDNA synthesized against both the S. aureus (lane F) and B. cereus (lane G) MS2 cultures also clearly showed the presence of phage cDNA, indicating that these bacteria were indeed capable of MS2 production. It was therefore evident that MS2 bacteriophage is not F+ E. coli specific, as had been previously described, but could infect a wider array of bacterial species. Even as the levels of MS2 cDNA production appeared similar in F+ E. coli, B. cereus, and S. aureus in this study, the latter two bacterial species were more sensitive to lysis than was F+ E. coli.",

Concentration-response testing of MS2 in B. cereus (unpublished results) showed an all or nothing response.

It has been demonstrated that MS2 phage uptake into E. coli cells is mediated through binding to the F pilin protein in the F pili.[19] Only F+ (but not F-) E. coli cells can take up MS2 bacteriophage, resulting in lysis. Indeed, F- E. coli cells were used in our studies as a negative control. Presumably any bacteria with F pilin expressed in their cell walls would be able to take up MS2. F+plasmids can be easily transferred from E. coli cell to E. coli cell by conjugation.[19] It is also likely that a similar exchange is possible between different bacterial species.

Studies have shown that A. barbadensis, C. sinensis, and S. spinescens extracts inhibit viral growth in human cell lines.[1631] S. spinescens and C. sinensis extracts have also shown significant inhibition against the MS2 bacteriophage in our plaque reduction assay. Although inhibition by A. barbadensis is not as pronounced in the current study, it is still evident when using this assay. However, it should be noted that comparing results seen against bacteriophage and viruses in human cell lines is ambiguous and future investigations using virally infected human cells lines are needed. By conducting these studies it will be possible to determine whether or not a direct comparison between this bacteriophage plaque assay and assays using viruses in human cell lines exists. If a correlation is seen, using this MS2 bacteriophage plaque assay as a first step for determining possible anti viral plants will be a valuable tool.",
