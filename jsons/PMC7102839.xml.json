This chapter will address some of the machinery that maintains the cellular environment and what happens when it breaks down or gets out of control. In particular we will consider the case of stray hydrophobic proteins that become exposed to the aqueous cytosol. These pose an aggregation risk and, as relevant, must be sent to a membrane, refolded to tuck the hydrophobic parts back into the safety of the core or labeled for disposal with ubiquitin tags and then degraded by the proteasome. Since these processes are crucial for maintaining cellular proteostasis, it is inevitable that failures in them, which, among other things, can be caused by absence or disruption of any of their machine components, may result in disease. At present, the precise roles of these proteins in disease are not well understood. This review will consider some of the major known constituents of the mammalian quality control machinery for hydrophobic proteins exposed to the cytoplasm, SGTA, BAG6, TRC35 and UBL4A, and catalog some of the current disease connections that exist in today's literature. It is likely that these references barely scratch the surface of the disease relevance and therapeutic potential of these proteins and that this field will continue burgeoning in the coming years.",

            "text": "There are many scenarios in which hydrophobic areas of proteins become aberrantly exposed to the aqueous cell cytoplasm. Large proteins often reach their native folded state via a number of intermediate states. During these folding pathways there is the potential for protein misfolding, which can result in additional deleterious functions that can lead to a range of diseases (Hartl & Hayer-Hartl, 2009). The more complex the protein, the higher the chance it will misfold. During the folding pathway there has evolved a need for a quality control network. As proteins pass through intermediate states where they are incompletely folded, they can expose buried regions to the solvent which can lead to undesired interactions; the exposure of these regions can be an indicator of protein misfolding (Buchberger, Bukau, & Sommer, 2010). It's the role of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones of the quality control network to protect these exposed regions and thus aid either the refolding of the protein, further prevention of misfolding or transport of the protein to a desired safe site (Buchberger et al., 2010). While chaperones do not increase the rate of folding, they do increase its efficiency by reducing the chances of undesired reactions such as aggregation (Fernandez-Fernandez & Valpuesta, 2018). Hence molecular chaperones and co-chaperones play a role in the essential protein quality control network that deals with unfolded and misfolded proteins.",

            "text": "Tail-anchored (TA) proteins represent a widespread but distinct case of hydrophobic regions requiring protection from the aqueous cytosol (Rabu, Schmid, Schwappach, & High, 2009). They are a class of membrane proteins that make up 3\u20135% of all membrane proteins including SNAREs (involved in vesicular trafficking); signaling proteins; endoplasmic reticulum translocon components and various enzymes that are spatially restricted (Borgese & Fasana, 2011). They therefore have critical roles in cell biology in membrane biogenesis, apoptosis, and protein degradation among many others. The specific localization of TA proteins within membranes is crucial to their task and, while their functions vary greatly, they are united in a common topology, based on the positioning of their single transmembrane helix (Kalbfleisch, Cambon, & Wattenberg, 2007). Newly synthesized TA proteins cannot be co-translationally directed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for insertion, as is traditional for membrane proteins, as their single membrane-spanning helix is at the extreme C-terminus and therefore inaccessible to the signal recognition particle during translation (Borgese & Fasana, 2011). This is where quality control proteins come into play, they are nature's solution to the insertion of the TA proteins into the ER membrane and this process shares common sorting and targeting machinery with the MLPs described above (Shao, Rodrigo-Brenni, Kivlen, & Hegde, 2017).",

            "text": "The details of these processes are still being established but many advances have been made in recent years including structure solution of some of the machinery for sorting and delivery (which will be discussed in the individual sections for each protein) and mechanistic understanding from cell biology and isolated systems (Shao et al., 2017). Our current understanding is summarized in Fig. 1\n. It is thought that SGTA can catch the TMDs of newly translated TA proteins or exposed hydrophobic patches on mislocalised membrane and secretory proteins (MLP), which bind to its C-terminal domain. In collaboration with the heterotrimeric BAG6 complex, which comprises BAG6, TRC35 and UBL4A, SGTA determines the fate of these proteins. Hydrophobic substrates bound to the BAG6 complex can be ubiquitinated by the actions of the E3 ligase RNF126 (Krysztofinska et al., 2016; Rodrigo-Brenni, Gutierrez, & Hegde, 2014) and thus targeted for proteasomal degradation. SGTA can interact with the RPN13 subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome through its TPR domain (Leznicki et al., 2015; Thapaliya et al., 2016), which has led to the proposal of an SGTA/BAG6 cycle operating at the proteasome (Leznicki & High, 2012). SGTA hands tail-anchored (TA) proteins over to TRC40 facilitating their post-translational integration into the ER by means of the transmembrane proteins WRB and CAML (Vilardi, Stephan, Clancy, Janshoff, & Schwappach, 2014). Furthermore, SGTA has been implicated in hormone receptor signaling and has been associated with viral lifecycles (Philp et al., 2013). SGTA's interactions with Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperones via its TPR domain likely provide substrate access to additional branches of the global cellular quality control network (Yin et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The focus of the first section of this chapter will be the molecular co-chaperone known as the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) (Wunderley, Leznicki, Payapilly, & High, 2014). A major known function of SGTA is to aid in determining the fate of secretory and membrane proteins that have mislocalized to the cytosol (Leznicki et al., 2013). SGTA is also thought to be the first port of call for tail-anchored proteins upon termination of translation when the two ribosomal subunits separate (Philp et al., 2013). On many occasions SGTA works in concert with the BAG6 complex, a heterotrimeric complex comprising stoichiometric volumes of BAG6 (BCL2-associated athanogene 6, formerly known as BAT3 or Scythe), UBL4A (ubiquitin-like protein 4A, sometimes known as GDX) and TRC35 (transmembrane domain recognition complex 35), that is also involved in the protein quality control network (Xu, Cai, Yang, Huang, & Ye, 2012) and these three proteins will be addressed in detail later on in this chapter. It's been suggested that one of the roles of the SGTA/BAG6 combination is in facilitation of the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) in which poorly folded proteins are retro-translocated through the ER membrane (Hampton & Sommer, 2012). SGTA has also been shown to rescue proteins from degradation by reversing the ubiquitination caused by BAG6 probably via recruitment of an, as yet unidentified, DUB or deubiquitinating enzyme (Leznicki & High, 2012). Disruption or incorrect use of these functions can lead to diseases such as cancer of the prostate, ovary, liver, polycystic ovary syndrome, Alzheimer's and many more (Philp et al., 2016). Here we will examine some of the current disease implications of SGTA.",

There is additionally a seventh alpha helix known as the C-terminal capping helix that aligns against the second helix of the third repeat, helix 6. The three repeats are structured in a parallel arrangement which creates a super helical structure containing a surface groove. This groove has been shown to play a role in intra-molecular interactions (Liou & Wang, 2005). The TPR domain is responsible for SGTA binding to Hsp70 and Hsp90, along with other varying receptors and proteins (Philp et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2015). Due to this, the TPR domain has been linked with SGTA's role in diseases such as HIV (Dutta & Tan, 2008) and the parvovirus (Cziepluch et al., 1998).",

This region has been implicated as responsible for the C-terminal's ability to interact with hydrophobic amino acids within polypeptides (Liou & Wang, 2005). Removal of this region resulted in no interactions with hydrophobic substrates (Liou & Wang, 2005). This allows for SGTA to bind to and then shield improperly or incompletely folded proteins with exposed hydrophobic regions, and thus provide a vital role within the protein quality control network. Very recently another important motif has been identified in the C-terminus called the NNP motif consisting of three copies of asparagine-asparagine-proline (Martinez-Lumbreras et al., 2018). The C-terminal domain has also been found to transiently dimerize, probably around hydrophobic substrates in the manner of a pair of tweezers (Martinez-Lumbreras et al., 2018).",

Typically, when membrane proteins with exposed hydrophobic residues enter the secretory pathway, they are met and transported by signal recognition particle dependent delivery to their desired location. This process prevents interactions between the cytosol and the exposed hydrophobic residues (Cross, Sinning, Luirink, & High, 2009). However sometimes membrane and secretory proteins end up mislocalized which can lead to undesired interactions with the cytosol; it's the responsibility of the protein quality control network to deal with this (Ast, Cohen, & Schuldiner, 2013). SGTA, alongside the BAG6 complex, plays a role in responding to MLPs while encouraging the transportation of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane (Hessa et al., 2011). Studies have suggested that while BAG6 promotes the polyubiquitylation of mislocalized hydrophobic substrates, SGTA can antagonize this process by activating substrate deubiquitylation (Leznicki & High, 2012). Both complexes also play a role in the ERAD pathway for irregular proteins (Xu et al., 2012).",

Overall SGTA plays an important role in cytosolic quality control; at the ER it encourages the biogenesis of certain hydrophobic precursors while additionally promoting the removal of irregular and misfolded proteins (Shao et al., 2017). Without the presence of SGTA, not only would the lifespan of potentially dangerous proteins be extended, but undesirable interactions between proteins and the cytosol could lead to aggregation, a suggested cause of some neurodegenerative diseases (Chakrabarti & Hegde, 2009; Wunderley et al., 2014).",

If proteins with exposed hydrophobic regions are allowed to interact with the cytosol they can form aggregates and inclusion bodies (Ross & Poirier, 2004). In Huntington's disorder, for example, inclusions have been found in regions of the brain that degenerate (Vonsattel et al., 1985). Another example is Alzheimer's disease, which is shown to be caused by two types of protein aggregates: extracellular and intracellular (Cox et al., 2018).

One such SHR, the androgen receptor (AR), is a testosterone-dependent, specific transcription factor (Cutress, Whitaker, Mills, Stewart, & Neal, 2008). Located in the cytoplasm, upon binding of the ligand to the AR, interactions take place within its N- and C-terminal domains that result in activation and transfer to the nucleus to activate transcription of specific genes (Cutress et al., 2008). ARs play an important role in locations such as the prostate gland; although their primary role in this organ is found during the growth of the gland, they still function after maturity (Brooke & Bevan, 2009).",

SGTA activity has been implicated in androgen regulation as a downregulator of the receptor by promoting retention within the cytoplasm (Buchanan et al., 2007). Studies suggest that this downregulation is caused by controlling the sensitivity to the AR ligand, which leads to retention within the cytoplasm (Trotta et al., 2013). However, one study showed that SGTA's role in this downregulation could be during the folding of the receptor, with SGTA affecting the ubiquitination and recycling of the receptor during the early folding stages (Paul et al., 2014). This links into its role in cytosolic quality control which supports this theory (Wunderley et al., 2014). The same study also suggests a link between SGTA and other SHRs, the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor activity suggesting that SGTA's role in hormone signaling extends beyond the androgen receptors (Paul et al., 2014).",

Usually, initial tumor growth is androgen dependent and driven by the AR activity within the cells (Brooke & Bevan, 2009). Androgen dependent prostate cancer involves the AR stimulating proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis of cells, thus ensuring the survival of cancerous cells (Brooke & Bevan, 2009). This form of the cancer is normally treated with androgen ablation and while most tumors respond to this treatment, some evolve into the androgen independent form which has been largely considered incurable (Cattrini et al., 2017). Androgen independent cancer evolves from genetic mutations within the cell that allow it to grow independent of AR activity; instead it follows pathways involving overexpression of BCL2 or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes among many others (Brooke & Bevan, 2009; Cattrini et al., 2017). These pathways have also been linked to other hormone independent cancers such as breast cancer (Bullock, 2016).",

One theory as to the mechanism behind this involves Hsp70, which is suggested to provide the energy needed by chaperones that are responsible for association and dissociation of proteins. SGTA interactions with Hsp70 increase protein affinity and result in more efficient protein folding; in yeast cells that lack SGTA there is a decrease in Hsp70 activity, and thus it's suggested that SGTA can indirectly affect the ligand binding capacity of the AR via this mechanism (Buchanan et al., 2007). Since it has separately been suggested that SGTA directly binds to the AR's hinge region, it correlates that SGTA overexpression directly inhibits the AR by reducing its ability to bind with ligands (Trotta et al., 2012). Despite conflicting ideas behind the mechanism of which SGTA affects AR activity, there has been evidence to suggest that overexpression leads to decreased activity, while underexpression leads to increased activity (Buchanan et al., 2007). Thus its widely accepted SGTA plays a role in prostate cancer development; however the mechanism by which this occurs is still not fully understood.",

Asides from affecting androgen signaling, SGTA has been linked to PCOS via its role in apoptosis, promoting cell death when both over- and under-expressed (Yin et al., 2006). A further role of SGTA within PCOS is insulin signaling. A study has shown that the SGTA gene is related to insulin resistance; however more research is needed to determine how and to what extent (Goodarzi et al., 2008). Overall it's shown that there is a probable role of SGTA in the cause of PCOS through multiple pathways, making it a possible target for therapy of this disease.",

They also found a positive correlation between SGTA concentration and breast cancer cell proliferation following SGTA knockout experiments. These results suggest that SGTA levels could be a potential indicator of breast cancer progression as concentration was found to increase at a higher histological grade.

As it lacks a surrounding lipid bilayer it cannot infect cells in the same way as enveloped viruses, which usually proceed via membrane fusion. Thus it needs to find a different path for entry to the cell; this is usually taken through virus-induced pore formation or disruption of the cell membrane's integrity (Wiethoff, Wodrich, Gerace, & Nemerow, 2005). Polyomaviruses are unique in that they travel past the endosomal system and reach the ER for membrane penetration; SV40 is known to infect cells via engaging the ganglioside receptor GM1 at the cell surface. Endocytosis then brings SV40 molecules complexed with lipid rafts into the cell where they proceed through endosomes before reaching the ER. After this SV40 has to exit through the ER membrane and cross the cytosol to reach the nucleus where it subsequently activates transcription and replication of the viral genome; thus cellular transformation is caused (Wiethoff et al., 2005). It is thought that SGTA associates with a B14 and B12 complex at the ER membrane and, during infection, SGTA binds directly to SV40 and thus promotes its ER membrane penetration. During this penetration, SGTA dissociates from the B14 and B12 complex and hence it is implied that SGTA is directly responsible for SV40\u2019s transport between the ER and the nucleus (Walczak et al., 2014).",

Then it linked the N-terminal domain with the infection of SV40 into the nucleus; although the exact role the N-terminal plays is uncertain, results showed that the N-terminal was crucial for further infection after SV40 has entered the cytosol. The study suggested that this could be via the N-terminal being directly involved in transport to the nucleus, or the N-terminal could recruit cellular components that subsequently transport the virus to the nucleus. Although it has been seen in other studies that SGTA can localize to the nucleus, and this suggests the direct involvement of the N-terminal in SV40 infection, more research is needed to further understand the role of SGTA in virus infection, and how its domains affect each stage (Dupzyk et al., 2017).",

This is aided by a direct stabilizing interaction between p53 gene and p300 acetyltransferase complex (Kawahara et al., 2013; Lee & Ye, 2013; Luce, Akpawu, Tucunduva, Mason, & Scott, 2016).

            "text": "The earliest cellular function associated with BAG6 was its role as an apoptosis regulator. Reaper, an apoptosis-inducer protein in Drosophila, binds its C-terminal 50 amino acids to BAG6 (previously called Scythe) which inhibits apoptosis. This is possible due to Reaper having the ability to bind directly to ribosomes, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. This is the case for several cell systems including HeLa human cancerous cells, indicating possible health conditions that may be caused in humans due to unregulated apoptosis (Mock et al., 2015). In vitro assays revealed that Reaper induces rapid cytochrome c release during mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and therefore is BAG6 dependent (Thress et al., 1998). Mechanistically, Reaper works by disrupting the interaction between BAG6 and UBL4A which leads to BAG6 sequestering pro-apoptotic Reaper. Therefore, BAG6 serves as an anti-apoptotic regulator. An example of unregulated apoptosis causing health defects is in mice, whereby because of in vivo genetic ablation of BAG6, embryonic lethality is caused due to amplified levels of apoptosis and cell proliferation (Desmots, Russell, Lee, Boyd, & McKinnon, 2005). This concludes that functional BAG6 has a direct effect on regulating developmental defects. Although deficiency of BAG6 increases apoptosis which negatively impacts tissues, chemicals which affect calcium flow via ER stress are more resistant against cortical neurons deficient of BAG6 (Desmots et al., 2005; Kawahara et al., 2013; Tsukahara et al., 2009). This deduces the complex roles of BAG6 with the ability to adapt its consequences on its clients requirements.",

BAG6 also binds to polyubiquitinated substrates showing that it is interacting multivalently with the proteasome for degradation (Lee & Ye, 2013; Payapilly & High, 2014). This is also the case for Defective Ribosome Products (DRiP) which behave using a similar mechanism.",

This targets the substrates to the proteasome where it undergoes degradation (Lee & Ye, 2013). It was experimentally deduced that BAG6 heterotrimeric complex is involved in the direct interaction of the proteasome-bound substrate whereby BAG6 plays a key role in the interaction. Therefore, depletion of BAG6 prevented turnover as degradation at the proteasome was inhibited by the absence of BAG6. The turnover of DRiPs is proposed to create MHC class I antigenic peptides, which, in the case of BAG6 depletion, have limited cell surface presentation (Minami et al., 2010). Antigen production results due to degradation of misfolded and mislocalized proteins. The importance of BAG6 here lies in its underexpression causing limited suppression of cell surface presentation in MHC class I which may be a basis of peptide ligands. Alongside this, BAG6 is a possible participant in transmembrane protein assembly, vital for antigen presentation (Kawahara et al., 2013).",

This poses challenges for cells experiencing ER-stress as membrane integration efficiency is further reduced. Ideally, TA proteins captured by BAG6 are transferred to TRC40 for ER membrane targeting. However, this pathway is not always efficient which can contribute to the build-up of mislocalized proteins in the cytosol. For some mislocalized transmembrane proteins, the TMD is targeted to polyubiquitination by E3 ligase and thus undergoes degradation at the proteasome (Amm, Sommer, & Wolf, 2014). Interestingly, BAG6 may behave in a similar manner to the ER lumen timer which controls the degradation of misfolded protein whereby only in the case of mislocalized proteins will BAG6 triage them to degradation at the proteasome (Lee & Ye, 2013).",

Typically, the efficiency of ER-targeting is relatively low depending on the strength of the ER signal. However, to enhance ERAD efficiency and, in turn, maintain homeostasis of both transmembrane and secretory proteins which are disassembled or misfolded, sophisticated chaperones are used to retro-translocate them to the proteasome for degradation (Payapilly & High, 2014). Sequentially, membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase including gp78 targets retro-translocated proteins for polyubiquitination. An ATPase associated multiprotein complex then extracts the ubiquitinated protein from the membrane and BAG6 is recruited. This suggests preferential chaperoning activity of BAG6 as opposed to the assisting multiprotein complex which shuttles the substrates to the proteasome for degradation. However, whether BAG6 directly interacts with the proteasome or is facilitated by an adaptor remains elusive (Lee & Ye, 2013; Payapilly & High, 2014).",

This implies that BAG6 works as a p97-mediated downstream retro-translocation of ERAD. Additionally, soluble and membrane proteins are stabilized in the case of BAG6 depletion.

On the other hand, non-ERAD substrates such as cytosolic Ub-V-GFP protein remained unaffected in degradation (Wang, Whynot, et al., 2011). This exemplifies the strong inhibitory effect of absent BAG6 on ERAD degradation. Although BAG6 can independently maintain retro-translocated substrates in a soluble, unfolded state, underexpression of its heterotrimeric complex counterparts TRC35 and UBL4A allowed ERAD substrates to remain stabilized.

Thus, the essential interaction between the two binding partners was explored in depth. GST pull-down analysis on Escherichia coli presented the co-precipitation of both GST-BAG domain and UBL4A, indicating that the domains interact directly.

An example of the necessary requirement of BAG6 in ERAD is demonstrated by interaction with Derlin2, an ER dislocon protein. BAG6-Derlin2 interaction facilitates the recruitment of BAG6 to the mislocalized protein site as well as retro-translocation of substrates back to the cytosol. Importantly, BAG6 is also essential during the ER exit of substrates and in the prevention of hydrophobic domains forming a blockade (Payapilly & High, 2014; Wang, Whynot, et al., 2011). Therefore, the heterotrimeric complex with BAG6 plays a crucial quality control role by functioning at the interface of protein biosynthesis and degradation.

            "text": "BAG6 polymorphism is associated with increased incidence of several autoimmune diseases such as Kawasaki syndrome and type I diabetes (Hsieh et al., 2011; Piras et al., 2014). As BAG6 influences numerous substrate proteins essential to immune regulations, it suggests a functional link between BAG6 and autoimmune disorders. This is demonstrated by examination of single-spanning transmembrane protein T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 (Tim-3), an inhibitory type I membrane receptor. In cases of tumor-bearing subjects, exhausted CD4 + T-cells show increased expression of Tim-3 which results in negative-regulation of immune functions as the T-cell response is repressed. Consequently, exhausted T-cells diminish effector functions including cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity in response to antigen stimulation. However, BAG6 plays a role in binding the tail of Tim-3 and galectin-9 facilitates the disruption of the binding by mediating phosphorylation at the Tim-3 tail on residues Tyr-256 and Tyr-263. Subsequently, BAG6 is released which permits the transduction of inhibitory signals (Binici et al., 2013). Therefore, when BAG6 is overexpressed, levels of Tim-3 is reduced which results in earlier onset of autoimmune development by promoting helper T-cell response. This is supported experimentally whereby increased levels of Tim-3 and low frequency of IFN-\u03b3-production were observed in BAG6-deficient T-cells. This is suggestive of BAG6\u2019s behavior as a repressor of Tim-3 activity which functions by protecting helper T-cells from galectin-9-mediated death, thereby promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and proliferation (Binici & Koch, 2014; Kawahara et al., 2013; Rangachari et al., 2012). Therefore, manipulations to the BAG6/Tim-3 interaction may be a potential molecular target in treatment of several chronic infections and autoimmune disorders.",

(2017). They have conglomerated the investigations of the well-defined GET pathway in yeast and the evolutionarily conserved mammalian homologues to suggest the chaperones involved act as a molecular triage system. BAG6, SGTA and TRC40 are the three proteins that can recognize and shield the transmembrane domain (TMD) of a TA protein (Leznicki et al., 2013). The C-terminal 110 residues of BAG6 form a complex with two tightly associated subunits UBL4A and TRC35 (collectively known as the cBag6 complex) (Mock et al., 2015), while the N-terminal part of BAG6 contains a UBL domain (nBag6) (Tanaka et al., 2016). As mentioned earlier, SGTA is the most competitive binder to exposed hydrophobic stretches of proteins, and in the first step the proteins undergo binding and shielding by SGTA, following which the proteins have one of two fates. The first involves the targeting module which consists of SGTA and TRC40 bridged by the cBag6 complex, where the TA protein binds to the TRC40 and is delivered to the ER for insertion. The second involves the quality control module exclusive to mammalian systems comprised of SGTA, nBag6 and a newly defined protein RNF126 (Krysztofinska et al., 2016) where the TA protein binds to nBag6 and is targeted for ubiquitination. These events are depicted in Fig. 1.",

The first structural analyses of Get5 were the crystal structure of just the Get5-N domain in complex with Get4, followed by determination of the C-terminal Get5 (Get5-C) structure by X-ray and SAXS by Chartron et al. (2012). The full Get5 protein structure was only later published in complexes with Get3 and Get4 by Gristick et al. (2014). While the interactions of the mammalian analogues of Get4 and Get5 were well studied in relation to the TA protein insertion, their molecular structures were not elucidated until more recently. The UBL4A crystal structure was elucidated by Kuwabara et al. (2015), and the TRC35 structure was recently published by Mock et al. (2017).",

Based on immunoprecipitation results where both Get4 and Get5 were completely immunoprecipitated from yeast cytosol by anti-Get5 this tight Get4/5 complex was verified. It was reported that the full length Get4/5 complex exists as a dimer, mediated by the C-terminal homodimerization domain of Get5, resulting in a heterotetramer. Prior to the structure elucidation, sequencing alignment experiments suggested that UBL4A in higher eukaryotes lacks the Get5-N domain, and TRC35 does not have a \u03b2-loop, both of which interact in yeast to form the Get4/5 complex. BAG6 was found to bridge UBL4A and TRC35 and form a similar construct (cBag6). Knockdown experiments using siRNA demonstrated that knocking down UBL4A or TRC35 alone has negligible effect on BAG6 presence; however simultaneous knockdown results in a threefold reduction of BAG6. When BAG6 was knocked down the levels of UBL4A and TRC35 were greatly reduced, but PCR analysis demonstrated that the mRNA levels remain almost constant, and BAG6 is needed to maintain TRC35 and UBL4A at the protein level. This experiment further proved that Bag6 can functionally substitute the Get5-N domain.",

The N-terminal domain (NTD) consists of the first seven helices, they do not contain an obvious internal consensus however they do exhibit some curvature. The C-terminal domain (CTD) continues with right handed helical coils, more varied in length. Bar the absent \u03b2-hairpin, TRC35 was found by Mock et al. (2017) to have the same overall conserved construct as Get4, with the first 14 \u03b1-helices forming the \u03b1-solenoid fold comprised of the NTD (RMSD = 1.38 \u00c5) and CTD (RMSD = 3.43 \u00c5). As a result of the absent \u03b2-hairpin \u03b111, \u03b113 and \u03b115 are shifted compared to Get4 resulting in the greater RMSD of the CTD. Get4 was found to physically interact with Get3 as well as Get5, the mammalian homolog TRC35 interacts with TRC40 as well as BAG6 (mediator of UBL4A interaction), and the residues of TRC35 at both the TRC40 and BAG6 binding interfaces are well conserved from the yeast homologs. The convex surface of Get4 has conserved regions in the C-domain as well as helices \u03b11-\u03b14, suggesting a usefulness of the convex surface for protein interactions. A cleft between \u03b12 and \u03b14 with conserved positive charges is proposed to be the N-terminal binding site to Get3 and similarly in TRC35 the binding site of TRC40.",

This interface is also conserved in mammalian systems and the BA G6 \u03b13 (L1032, Y1036 and M1040) interacts along the helices \u03b19, \u03b110, \u03b111 of TRC35 (F195 and M271) (Mock et al., 2017).

(2015) verifying that BAG6 mediates the indirect interaction between TRC35 and UBL4A. UBL4A-C domain was found to contain three helices, helices 1 and 2 form the dimer interface with conserved hydrophobic residues, and helix 3 wraps around BAG6-C (Kuwabara et al., 2015). The UBL4A heterodimerization domain is identical to the Get5-C homodimerization domain, and the hydrophobic residues (W179, I182, L186, F190, V200, L204, W208) of the Get5-C core are conserved in UBL4A (W96, I99, L103, F107, V115, L119, Y123) (Mock et al., 2015). The central ubiquitin-like domain of Get5 (Get5-UBL) domain was found to form a complex with Sgt2, and structural information was elucidated by Chartron, Gonzalez, and Clemons (2011) via small angle X-ray scattering, then by Simon, Simpson, Hawthorne, et al. (2013) via NMR. Crystal structures of the Get5-UBL domain were published shortly thereafter by Chartron et al. (2012), Simon, Simpson, Goldstone, et al. (2013) and Tung, Li, Lin, and Hsiao (2013), and consist of an \u03b1-helix: two sets of antiparallel \u03b2-strands and two 3/10 (\u03b7) helices that form a UBL beta-grasp fold. Compared to the solution NMR structure of the UBL domain of UBL4A (UBL4A-UBL; PDB ID: 2DZI), the Get5-UBL domain is very similar with an average RMSD of 1.23 \u00c5, the few differences due to small sequence insertions, and the \u03b2-sheet surface elements are conserved between the two proteins (Chartron et al., 2012). Using NMR, Xu et al. (2012) determined that the UBL site on UBL4A is a non-conventional type IIb class, unrecognizable by UBD and CUE. This Get5/UBL4a-UBL domain has been demonstrated to be unique due to a charged polar residue near the binding site, and is clearly distinguished from other UBLs resulting in specific and favored interactions (Xu et al., 2012).",

Early links were found between Sgt2, Get5, Get4 and Get3 in large scale yeast two-hybrid yeast two-hybrid and tandem-affinity assays, as well as mass spectrometry analyses of protein complexes (Gavin et al., 2006; Ito, Chiba, & Yoshida, 2001; Uetz et al., 2000). In a large scale genetic yeast study using small molecules, Get4 and Get5 were found to have highest correlation scores as interactors of Sgt2 based on homozygous co-sensitivity for yeast deletion strains (Hillenmeyer et al., 2008). In vitro immunoprecipitation results showed Sgt2 in varying (almost invariably lower) concentrations compared to the identical amounts of Get4 and Get5, suggestive of a transient association of Sgt2 with the Get4/5 complex, therefore a dynamic stoichiometry (Chang et al., 2010). It was postulated following these studies that Sgt2 mediates the transfer to Get3 via the Get4/5 complex especially as Sgt2 was found to be the first point of contact for TA membrane proteins in yeast following release from the ribosome (Brodsky, 2010). The mammalian homologs SGTA, BAG6, UBL4A, TRC35 and TRC40 were found via proteomic analyses to interact with one another, indicative of similar TA protein transfer between the chaperones (Sowa, Bennett, Gygi, & Harper, 2009).",

This was confirmed in computer docking, ITC and NMR relaxation experiments (Chartron et al., 2012; Simon, Simpson, Goldstone, et al., 2013). ITC and microscale thermophoresis (MST) were used by Darby et al. (2014) to demonstrate a corresponding 1:1 stoichiometry between the mammalian homologs SGTA and UBL4A. Simon, Simpson, Goldstone, et al. (2013) analyzed the interface between constructs covering Sgt2-NT (residues 1\u201378) and that make up Get5-UBL (residues 70\u2013152). Following X-ray crystallographic structure identification, reciprocal chemical shift perturbation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments were used to map the binding interactions. A well conserved helix in the Sgt2-NT helical dimer interface with an adjoining negatively charged surface (D28, D31, D38, E42) forms strong electrostatic interactions with the highly positively charged binding patch in the Get5-UBL fragment (K85, K79, K122, K124). The two pairs of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets of Get5-UBL provide the main interactions, specifically \u03b21 and \u03b24 and the loops connecting \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 (Simon, Simpson, Goldstone, et al., 2013). Exposed hydrophobic residues of Sgt2-NT (V35, C39) were also found to be crucial for the binding interface, and interact with compatible residues of Get5-UBL (I81, L120, V125, G143, M147) (Chartron et al., 2012). A salt concentration dependency in the interaction of SGTA-NT with UBL4A-UBL was observed by Leznicki et al. (2013), indicating that the strong electrostatic binding is conserved in mammalian analogues. Darby et al. (2014) biochemically characterized the interaction using NMR perturbation shifts followed by computer docking analysis and confirmed the electrostatic binding. The negatively charged residues of SGTA-NT at the binding interface (D27, E30, E33, E40) are highly conserved, interacting with conserved positively charged residues of UBL4A-UBL (K6, K66, K46, K48). The greatest difference between the interactions of mammalian and yeast complexes is the 45\u00b0 rotation of the mammalian system due to the shift in the charge distribution of key residues on the surface of each interacting partner.",

Early analyses demonstrated that the Get4/5 complex functions upstream of Get3 in the GET targeting pathway enabling transfer of TA proteins from the ribosome to Get3, a direct, but transient, physical interaction was expected (Hu, Li, Qian, Denic, & Sha, 2009; Jonikas et al., 2009). Crystal structure analysis confirmed this reaction, and computational docking experiments performed found that the conserved patch of positive residues at the Get4 N-terminal face acts as the binding interface suggestive of complementary electrostatic interactions with Get3 justifying the salt-sensitivity of the interaction observed in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Chang et al., 2010). A 1:1 stoichiometry was confirmed by SAXS, wherein the Get3 exists as a dimer binding to two Get4-N termini of the Get4/5 dimer complex (Chang et al., 2010).",

Using ATPase assays they found that binding of Get4/5 to Get3 reduces the ATPase activity of Get3 10-fold, and inhibits Get3 tetramerization indicating that Get4/5 induces tighter ATP binding by Get3, this demonstrates that ATP-bound \u201cclosed\u201d Get3 binds with greater affinity than the apo-Get3 to Get4/5 (Rome et al., 2013). Gel filtration chromatography further established this relationship since a complex was only formed between Get4/5 and apo-Get3 with saturating ATP present. SEC, pull-down and ITC experiments carried out by Gristick et al. (2014) confirmed a preference of Get4/5 for the \u201cclosed\u201d ATP-bound Get3 form.

The first is the anchoring interface responsible for binding specificity, and it involves \u03b12 (Y30, R37, R42) of Get4 forming hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts within the groove created by \u03b110 and \u03b111 of Get 3 (F246, Y250, E253, Q257, E258, E304, D308). \u03b11 of Get4 containing conserved charged residues (K15, R19) is tilted toward \u03b110 of Get3. The second interface is responsible for ATPase regulation, located on the opposite monomer, and involves conserved complementary charged residue interactions, and the C-terminal end of \u03b14 (D74, E1) of Get4 lies in the post-\u03b13 loop (K69, K72, R75) of Get3. The regulatory interface was found by mutating residues on the expected regulatory surface: K69D on Get3 and D74K on Get4; Mock et al. (2017) demonstrated that the corresponding regulatory mutations: K86D in Trc40 and D84K in TRC35 resulted in a similar response observing a loss if ATPase inhibition and reduction of TA insertion. Gristick et al. (2014) refined the model for Get3-Get4/5 complex formation, using pre-steady state kinetics. They found that an intermediate is formed by initial electrostatic interactions with a single Get4/5 heterotetramer bound to one monomer of a Get3 dimer; this then rearranges in a second step to a stable final complex dominated by hydrophobic interactions. Upon binding of the TA protein ATP hydrolysis is promoted and Get3 is released from the Get4/5 complex. Mock et al. demonstrate that as expected when histidine tagged SGTA (hSGTA) was incubated with TRC40 in the presence of the cBag6 complex a resultant ATP-dependent increase in the rate of transfer of a TA protein was observed compared to its absence (Mock et al., 2015). In yeast the increased rate in transfer is not just a result of proximity, rather a regulatory role carried out by the Get4/5 complex; Mock et al. (2015) have illustrated that the cBag6 complex performs a similar regulatory role to the Get4/5 complex as originally postulated.",

The second mechanism involves the assembly of the Get3 membrane-targeting complex, and binding of Get3 to ATP shifts the protein to the closed conformation, the only form recognized by the Get4/5 heterotetramer.

The pathway protects against high levels of aggregation, and it allows a rapid and private bridging mechanism of transfer from SGTA to TRC40 using the Get4/5 complex equivalent cBag6 (Wang et al., 2010). These specific interactions: of SGTA with UBL4A and of TRC40 with TRC35 confirm the role of the cBag6 complex as an active tethering device, it brings TRC40 into proximity with its substrates and activates it for TMD recognition serving as more than just an adapter function or bridge (Hegde & Keenan, 2011). If any proteins in Get4/5 or cBag6 complexes are absent, then bridging is impaired and so is the capture of the protein by TRC40/Get3. It is clear therefore that the protein chaperones involved in bridging are crucial for delivery of TA proteins, and their up/downregulation will likely affect subsequent processes and lead to disease.",

The holdase activity has been found to play a role in retro-translocation of ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum assisted degradation) substrates to the proteasome; mediation of DNA damage response signaling (DDR); degradation of mislocalized membrane proteins, as well as the above discussed chaperoning of nascent TA proteins to the ER.

The cBag6 complex maintains the solubility of retro-translocated polypeptides, facilitating movement of the misfolded proteins across the ER membrane for targeting to the cytosolic proteasome before aggregation. This action promotes cell survival under stress conditions. BAG6 is a nuclear protein, but was found to be present in the cytosol and in an ER-containing membrane fraction. For engagement in ERAD there must be a sufficient presence of BAG6 in cytosol; TRC35 maintains a cytosolic pool of BAG6 (Xu et al., 2012). TRC35 is also involved in the holdase activity of BAG6 in the cell (Mock et al., 2017). UBL4A function is still unclear.

Knockdown experiments using siRNA demonstrated that knocking down UBL4A or TRC40 alone has negligible effect on Bag6 presence and therefore cell death, knockdown of both simultaneously results in a threefold reduction of bag6 and cells are more resistant to death.

(2014) revealed that UBL4A bridges an association between TC45 and STAT3, mediating efficient phosphorylation by TC45, and blocking p-STAT3-dependent cancer cell growth. The authors found that tumor growth rate and tumor size were both greatly reduced in B16 murine melanoma cells in vivo when transfected with UBL4A, and it does so by targeting p-STAT3. The results suggest that UBL4A may function as a tumor suppressor, further implied when the deletion of UBL4A facilitated MEF cell proliferation, potentially providing a new strategy for tumor therapy.",

GdX is the UBL4A gene; GdX knockout mice indicate a critical role of UBL4A in skeletal biology; at the embryonic stage they have decreased bone mineral density, and later demonstrate a blended spine and reduced growth. UBL4A mutations may be a potential cause for skeletal dysplasias and other bone disorders via repressed osteoblast formation and increased chrondrocyte differentiation; however this is yet to be proven in human systems.",

This field is still rapidly evolving and there are many outstanding questions, in particular with regard to understanding the roles of this machinery in disease states. It is likely that one or more of the proteins discussed here is already under investigation as a drug target and that many of the interaction partners for these proteins have yet to be identified. In the future these ambiguities will become clearer but for now, we have outlined the currently suggested connections between SGTA, BAG6, UBL4A and TRC35 and a range of diseases.",

SGTA can catch the TMDs of newly translated TA proteins or exposed hydrophobic patches on MLPs, which bind to its C-terminal domain. In collaboration with the heterotrimeric BAG6 complex, which comprises BAG6, TRC35 and UBL4A, SGTA determines the fate of these proteins. Hydrophobic substrates bound to the BAG6 complex can be ubiquitinated by the actions of the E3 ligase RNF126 and thus targeted for proteasomal degradation. SGTA can interact with the RPN13 subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome through its TPR domain, which has led to the proposal of an SGTA/BAG6 cycle operating at the proteasome. SGTA hands tail-anchored (TA) proteins over to TRC40 facilitating their post-translational integration into the ER by means of the transmembrane proteins WRB and CAML. Furthermore, SGTA has been implicated in hormone receptor signaling and has been associated with viral lifecycles. SGTA's interactions with Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperones via its TPR domain likely provide substrate access to additional branches of the global cellular quality control network.",
