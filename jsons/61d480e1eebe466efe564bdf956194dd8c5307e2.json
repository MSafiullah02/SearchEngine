Methods: This systematic review of the current literature study was conducted during July 2017, and all articles, books, guidelines, manuals and dissertations pertaining to the Incident Command System were analyzed. A total of articles and relevant documents were identified and finally these articles, which we found, were analyzed based on the specified indicators. Results: In this research 992 articles and relevant documents were identified and eventually, 48 articles were included and analyzed. The results were categorized into 6 main groups including 65 subgroups and 221 variables: features of hospital incident command system (14 subgroups and 53 variables), strengths of the system (15 subgroups and 70 variables), weaknesses of the system (10 subgroups and 15 variables), factors influencing the system's performance improvement (12 subgroups and 42 variables), factors that reduce the effectiveness of system include 11 subgroups (10 internal factors and 1 external factor) and 22 variables and important factors in assessing system performance (2 sub-groups and 19 variables). Conclusion: According to the results, Evaluating the effectiveness of a hospital accident command system (HICS) in a valid method can improve the efficiency of this system. In this appraisal, hospital managers and health decision-makers should consider principles, characteristics, strengths and weakness of it.",

            "text": "T oday, the occurrence of unexpected incidents around the globe affects governments and nations causing a great number of fatalities and significant economic losses. Despite many recent advances, incidents and disasters remain one of the most important concerns of a man's life [1] . Therefore, it is important to pay more attention to the development of plans, principles on natural disaster reduction and their effects, as well as the proper management of disaster risk reduction [2] . Among the many components involved in crisis management, relief and rescue in emergencies, healthcare centers, especially hospitals, play a major role [3] . Due to the lack of predetermined structures for proper management and focus on activities and training programs, these healthcare centers may expose to multiple risks and performance dysfunction [4] . Therefore, hospital preparedness is the main element of disaster management programs, which should be based on a standard protocol [5] . One of the invaluable management instruments which has an effective role in empowering services of healthcare centers according to global experiences is the Hospital Incident Command system (HICS) [6] . Hospital Incident Command system is a management system used to help manage incidents in unexpected situations and makes an attempt to build a coordination between hospitals and other institutions involved through using a rational and integrated management structure, responsibilities and duty description, creation of transparent reporting channels, and building a simplified and commonplace terminology system [4, 7] . Regardless of their size or ability to provide care for the patient, health centers, especially hospitals, can use the system for planning and responding at all-hazard emergency situations [8] . According to the reports published by the organizations in the United States, the system has been able to improve the quality of delivered hospital services in crisis situations very effectively and offered many effective crisis management plan and strategies for the hospital [4] . HICS was designed in 1991 as one of the strategies of hospitals for contrast with disasters with the mission of prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery in hazards [6] . The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is widely used by hospitals, yet there is a paucity of research and a lack of developed models to examine HICS implementation [6, 9] . In addition, our review shows that there has been no comprehensive study analyzing the positive or negative aspects of the system [9] . Perhaps the importance to develop HICS for emergencies has led scholars to ignore its qualitative aspects [6] . Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of Hospital Incident Command System, the current study aimed to assess the effectiveness of system with a focus on its features, strengths, weaknesses, factors contributing to the increasing and decreasing of system effectiveness, as well as important factors involved in system assessment. The aim of the current study was investigating and categorize factors affecting HICS effectiveness with a focus on its features, strengths, weaknesses, factors contributing to the increasing and decreasing of system effectiveness, as well as important factors involved in system assessment to improve the effectiveness of HICS. Therefore, the findings of this study can increase the knowledge of decision makers about the HICS in order to improve hospital readiness and respond appropriately during accidents and disasters.",

This system is designed to achieve the common goal of incident prevention, reduction of mortality, financial losses and severe damage. The system has several features that contribute to achieving these goals and affect its success. The present study indicated that there are several significant features affecting the effectiveness of hospital incident command system including the organized command structure [10] based on the same principles and compliance with the key structure of the incident command [9, 11, 12] use of a bureaucratic framework based on military principles [13] . This system is characterized by an organizational form of the structure [6], hierarchical structure [13] [14] [15] , and a specific command chain [16] . In addition, this system provides an appropriate and reliable structure for leadership regardless of the incident type [17] . A clear spoken language -based on the common [4, 6, 9,12-18 ,16], simple and commonplace [4, 18] terminology is another feature of the system.the hospital incident command system can define specific organizational functions and roles through job descriptions [11, 19, 20] , rational tenets for the allocation and organization of occupational activities [14] clarify the precise managerial tasks and responsibilities [21] , access to a list of personal job descriptions [ [28] , responsibilities of hospital incident command system team [29] ,Specifying specific roles in an organizational table [22, 23] , and consequently prioritize tasks based on the job description worksheets [6] and recruit the personnel when it becomes necessary [30] . Additionally, numerous studies have focused on other structural features of Hospital Incident Command System including modularity [12] , flexibility [13-16, 19, 23, 31] , both flexibility and modularity [4, 6-8, 11, 14, 18, 32] , analogy and comparison [9], compatibility [17] , adaptability in crisis situations at a variety of scales [17, 18, 23] , and category [26, 31] and concordance with planned and unplanned events [33] and effective for management in potentially changing environments [10]. The hospital incident command system is based on the principles and characteristics mentioned. Applying these principles and features will ensure the utilization of resources and reduce policy discrepancies and the operations of accountable organizations.",

The hospital incidnet command system brings significant benefits to hospitals and plays an important role in improving the quality and delivery of services during emergencies and disasters in hospitals. Hospital incident command system provides a powerful framework [10] standard template [8], structured and organized incident response [16] and facilitates emergency incident response [19] . various advantages for hospital incident command system including provision of the most reliable management protocols [18] , and comprehensive crisis management strategy [8] can apply to improve the management capabilities of the emergency [31] . HICS develops strategies for effective and efficient dealing with crisis situations [4], accelerates effective and quick response [8, 11] , increases effectiveness [18, 23] , enhances efficiency and effectiveness of the response plan [31, 34] , facilitates communication between different units of the system in emergency incidents [35] , fosters problem solving process among the organizations involved [22, 25] and ultimately, reduces the chance of errors and parallel work [25] . Hospital incident command system provides a response planning [36] this system can offer hospital of all sizes with an opportunity to plan, prepare and respond to both emergency and nonemergency situations, make other relevant units and organizations take part in the emergency response depending upon the size and type of incident [4, 18] , extend or limit the size, scope, and complexity of an incident, assign particular tasks or position based on the magnitude of the incident [8] accelerates effective and quick response [8, 11] and consequently guarantees the successful implementation of the plan [37] . Furthermore, numerous studies have mentioned another strength of the system including: detection of system capabilities by other organizations [8], providing a system for coordination [12] coordination between hospitals [4, 23, 38] and accountable organizations [4, 6-8, 23], coordinating activities among independent groups and coordinated response actions [6] coordinated response to emergencies situations [8, 11, 35, 39] , coordinated multi-disciplinary response to public health threats [28] , mutual efforts [40] , decentralization in decision-making [10] and building unity in dealing with complex and extreme crises, making incident command system known to the public [7].",

Similarly, SA Andrew et al. questioned the usefulness capabilities of system in reducing organizational disputes, especially at large-scale incidents and events [46] and FM Burkle et al. found that the system is unable to manage the complexities of a large-scale health-related disaster, especially epidemic situations [47] . the main disadvantage is that the structure cannot be changed or be reliable in terms of training, coordination and administrative capability [48] .Furthermore, Timm NL et al. reported that hospital staff were completely unfamiliar with the language system and were unable to use terms such as logistics, operations, financial to explain leadership roles [48] .The vastness of the range of job descriptions in the system is another weakness of the system [48] Likewise, NL Timm et al. noted the inefficiency of the system in real time response and exposure to stress [48] .

Therefore, it is important to Bull Emerg Trauma 2020;8(2) 74 pay special attention to several factors for increasing the effectiveness of the system within the hospitals, including familiarity with the organizational structure of the system [18] , creation of cluster structures for the system at the planning stage depending on the response phase [47] determining the organizational hierarchy of the structure based on the requirements rather than the titles [17] development of units, positions, description of new duties in accordance with hospital requirements [14] definition of job description and supervision of managers [22] and providing training and information to managers at all levels for creation of a common language and building culture [23] . The application of advanced communication technology to coordinate and provide critical information between incident command teams [41] has been one of the most important elements in improving system performance, furthermore It is necessary to pay special attention to regional coordination plays a significant role in the promotion of system efficiency [49] . Also the existence of transparent reporting channels [7, 20, [23] [24] [25] and transmission of information to high-level authorities [10] are the two main aspects of the incident command system, which can facilitate the information collection, reporting [28] , sharing information [31] , information acquisition and information dissemination [50] . In order to improve the effectiveness of the system, some additional measures need to be taken: removing financial barriers to implement the system, [23] financing the hospital to establish the system, [23] providing procurement opportunities for staff and offices to strengthen the crisis management culture [15] , supporting the Ministry of Health and taking into account additional funding for promotion of system [22] .compliance with the rules and regulations [23] , compliance with instructions and guidelines among the personnel and medical staff [37] , enhancing compliance with the system principles [35] developing guidelines and regulations for hospitals and legal requirements [22] .",

By identifying these factors and improving them, the efficiency of the incident command system can be improved. The hospital incident command system has been recognized as a vital tool for meeting the compliance with accreditation requirements [8]. The hospital incident command system also provides opportunities for quantitative and targeted structural assessment [51] , assessment of hospital preparedness, processes, identifying, locating and recovering errors [41] , exercises for preparedness against disasters [51] , and finally creates an assessment system [12] . Also, in evaluating the system, all the levels and functions of the system [51] , including the administrative and executive support, planning and adaptation, communication, decision-making, exercises, training and retraining [9] in a real or simulated disaster to be quantitatively and accurately analyzed [23] . Assessing the functions of the hospital incident command system is essential and useful, for example, the effectiveness of the coordination function of the system can be assessed by examining the implementation of cross-measures in accordance with the instructions of the mutual interlocutors [35] and reviewing the coordination with local and foreign authorities [9].",
