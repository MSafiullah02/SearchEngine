Based on this assessment, some patients are enrolled in an intensive outpatient group undergoing treatment based on the principles of the Dialectical Behavior Therapy (4). This approach aims to facilitate the achievement and maintenance of abstinence from alcohol by teaching patients how to cope with emotional dysregulation due to lack of mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation strategies, and distress tolerance skills (4).",
