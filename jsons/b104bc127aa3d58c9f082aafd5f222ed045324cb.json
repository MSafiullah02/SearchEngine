The first occurred following early human settlements in the Neolithic; a combination of higher aggregate populations and cohabitation with animals allowed microbial transfer from animals to humans. During the second wave, contacts between Eurasian populations transmitted microbes between cultures (the Black Death is the paradigmatic example), and formerly epidemic diseases became endemic. After 1500 CE, the third wave saw pathogens like smallpox distributed around the globe via the Columbian Exchange. 2 The focus of this Forum is McMichael's fourth and most recent wave, which constitutes the large-scale ecological and technological transitions underway since the later nineteenth century. 3 These transformations include the construction of massive and systemic infrastructures, unprecedented urbanization, the development and deployment of new materials, mass deforestation, the disintegration of natural habitats, pollution, species extinction, and industrialized agriculture. 4 Through such processes, humans have unsettled planetary ecologies to an unparalleled extent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 759, "end": 760, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 949, "end": 950, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1240, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The public health effects of this relentless human niche construction have been dramatic and in some ways paradoxical.

Legionnaires' disease, for example, was first observed in the United States in 1976. The bacterium only thrives in warm water of between 25 and 42 C, conditions rarely encountered outside of human-built water infrastructures: whirlpools, showers, hot tubs, hot-water tank sediment, and cooling towers. 15 Fourth, the Anthropocene is an age of material transition and diversification. While traditional technological networks were composed of wood, stone, and iron and powered by organic energy sources, newer technological systems incorporate a wider range of materials, particularly rarer metals and synthetic substances. 16 Many of these materials were used for functionally specific and critical elements of technological systems like batteries, insulation, fuses, and microchips. Additionally, many new chemical products like nylon, PCBs, Teflon, and stilbestrol used in everyday consumer items permeate our planet. Living bodies soon began to inhale and ingest these materials, resulting not only in the emergence of various forms of cancer, but also conditions like asthma and allergies. 17 Disposing of such materials is also a serious environmental problem. 18 As Gregg Mitman has argued, the \"multitudinous exposures permeating our modern world\" mark this epoch as materially distinct from earlier periods. 19 Brett Walker compellingly illustrates this development in his essay on asbestos and 9/11. In the Anthropocene, motorization and aviation have allowed people and pathogens to move at unprecedented speeds. Electrification and computerization enable information to move almost instantaneously.

It has long been understood that long-distance transportation and processing of food can contribute to the formation and distribution of pathogens, which in turn catalyzed attempts to retard decay, particularly through refrigeration. However, it has proved impossible to prevent food systems from spreading disease. Listeriosis, for example, survives at cold temperatures and thus thrived within refrigerated environments. The appearance of E. coli O157:H7 in 1982, a deadly version of an otherwise unremarkable inhabitant of mammalian guts, created great speculation about the role played by contemporary food systems in the distribution and even generation of disease. A combination of giant feedlots, grain feeding, and the administration of antibiotics have all been actively implicated in the emergence of this deadly pathogen.

It revealed several hundred potential cases of sleeping sickness, of which a few score were confirmed to have trypanosomes in their bodies. At the same time, Feldmann also placed Glossina palpalis, the tsetse fly, on the map, collecting specimens and then inquiring whether people living on the shore of the lake or along the Mori and Mara Rivers were familiar with the biting flies. While the majority of his report reads, typical of Feldmann's bravado, as a tale of maneuvers through new territories where he singlehandedly surveyed several thousand people for sleeping sickness, subsequent plans for the anti-sleeping sickness campaign in the area reveal a cadre of shadow assistants that enabled his work. Feldmann mentioned in passing how \"his fly-catchers,\" working independently from him, helped to assemble a picture of sleeping sickness ecology in the area. 18 African assistants who circulated along with Feldmann into the Mori bay and watershed, as well as along the lakeshore, allowed him to map the extent of sleeping sickness and presence of the fly vector within a wide swath of territory, and to do so relatively quickly. He incorporated these workers into a proposed budget for a sleeping sickness camp at Shirati, and several months later, when Feldmann had been posted to Lake Tanganyika to organize antisleeping sickness efforts there, fly-catchers and their provisioning again made up a key item in his budget. The collectors at Lake Tanganyika were to be paid 12 rupees each per month and provided with boots, suits, and leg wrappings to protect them from the bites of infected flies. 19 This wage was more than that for porters and men who policed the lakeshore and, by comparison, was triple the yearly hut tax of 4 rupees that the German East African government required at the time. 20 We have a sense, then, that specimen collecting-working as a Fliegenf\u00e4nger for the Germans-was comparatively lucrative work for the few who had it. We unfortunately do not know how these men came to be employed or any great detail about their age, place of origin, or training. Perhaps local authorities mediated their employment, as with a group of medical auxiliaries posted north of Bukoba, or perhaps they were drawn from the ranks of young men working in another capacity for the administration at Shirati. 21 Their assistance became indispensable for the campaign around Shirati, where dense fly populations, scant infrastructure, and a Luo-speaking population perceived as being more mobile and dispersed made for a complex and constantly shifting intervention. 22 Accurate collection of tsetse and mapping of fly habitats shaped German officers' arguments that the district was by and large verseucht (contaminated), and, by extension, that preventing the spread of the disease using ambulatory treatment with antitrypanosomal drugs in a central isolation camp was not feasible.

Before then, infectious disease was the greatest health threat. Following the so-called epidemiological transition, when Western nations gained the upper hand on infectious disease, a new period of \"managed fear\" emerged as diseases once considered to be fatal now were controllable, if at tremendous cost to patients and caregivers. 3 No chronic illness may better exemplify our state of ambient dread than diabetes.

The frame was first created in the late nineteenth century when physicians and nurses across the Western world noticed increased diabetes incidence and prevalence. Many attributed the rise to longer life spans, but others pointed to changes in diet, body size, and increased affluence plus the stresses of industrial urban life. As British physician Robert Saundby wrote in 1900, diabetes was \"one of the penalties of advanced civilization.\" 9 Others added racial explanations to the list, insisting that diabetes was a Judenkrankheit, a Jewish disease, rooted in ethnic tendencies toward obesity or overeating. 10 This type of diabetes was previously called maturity or adult-onset diabetes, or fat diabetes; it is called type 2 diabetes today. The other main variant, which usually strikes in youth, was called juvenile-onset or thin diabetes; this is type 1 diabetes, and it was a death sentence. The discovery of injectable insulin in 1921 revolutionized the treatment of diabetes, specifically type 1, by saving lives with the trade-off of transmuting a once fatal illness into a chronic disorder. 11 But insulin therapy did not shatter the frame of diabetes as a disease of progress. Rather, the frame shifted to enclose other groups, notably Native Americans. At the start of the twentieth century, American Indians were defined as uniquely vulnerable to acute infectious illnesses like tuberculosis. While observers blamed inadequate sanitation, limited health care, and poor nutrition for high infectious disease prevalence, many also believed that Native susceptibility was \"embedded in their bodies.\" 12 The frame of Indians as epidemiologically fragile expanded to include chronic disease, thanks, in large part, to long-term research by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on the Akimel O'odham, or Pima. Launched in 1965, the NIH studies, which continue in some form to this day, were originally conceived to compare rheumatoid arthritis prevalence in two communities: the Niits\u00edtapi (Blackfeet Confederacy) of Montana and the Akimel O'odham of south-central Arizona. After discovering that nearly one in three Pima had significantly elevated blood glucose levels, the NIH shifted to investigate diabetes instead. G. Donald Whedon, director of the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases, reported in 1965 that the Pima provided \"an unparalleled opportunity\" to study \"the influence of heredity and environment\" on the natural history of diabetes. Similar studies on the general US population, he continued, would be impossible due to the overwhelming scale and \"extreme mobility\" of the sample size. Left unmentioned in Whedon's report was the Pima's relative confinement to the Gila River Indian Community, their sovereign reservation. 13 The discovery of diabetes among the Pima surprised the NIH researchers, but other investigators had already laid the foundations of inquiry. The physician-anthropologist Ale\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka claimed in 1908 that while Indians' constitution was \"superior to that of the whites living in larger communities,\" the Pima were also much heavier than their counterparts. He blamed their \"sedentary\" habits, increased life span, and their changed diet that included \"everything obtainable that enters into the dietary of the white man.\" 14 By the postwar years, other researchers speculated that southwestern tribes residing in \"recently-irrigated, low-altitude areas of high average year-round temperatures,\" like the Pima, had higher diabetes prevalence than Indians \"in high-altitude plains and timberlands\" because of their dietary customs and dependence upon agriculture. 15 Some added genetics to the original formulation of race and environment to explain Indian predisposition, suggesting that groups like the Pima were \"a natural group for the critical study of diabetes\" because of their \"marked familial history . . . and inbreeding.\" 16 One popular theory, proposed in 1960 by physical anthropologist James V. Neel, was the \"thrifty genotype\" hypothesis. Neel argued that periods of famine or undernutrition had acted as a selective pressure within hunter-gatherer societies, where metabolic efficiency was an advantage. Now, an evolutionary advantage had become a disadvantage. 17 While Neel may not have intended his hypothesis to be applied to Native peoples, the NIH researchers, along with other scientists studying indigenous populations, initially accepted Neel's concept even as some at the time considered it incomplete. Indeed, Neel's theory has been amended several times and remains controversial and widely disputed to this day. 18 All of these theories relied, in part or in whole, on environmental and evolutionary mechanisms to explain diabetes prevalence. Moreover, early evidence to support these theories often came from research on Native communities. As the first group of NIH scientists dispatched to Arizona argued in 1967, the \"broader and more intensive study of the evolution of diabetes in the Pima Indians may produce information applicable to the general problem of obesity diabetes.\" 19 Almost three decades later, the Pima studies had arguably become some of the most important research on diabetes in the world. Peter H. Bennett, former director of NIH field studies in Arizona, stated in 1999, \"environmental risk factors\" were likely responsible for diabetes prevalence among the Pima \"because the genetic constitution of the population cannot change over such a short period of time.\" In his mind, the diabetes epidemic was \"a clear example of genetic-environmental interaction\" where certain groups, like the Pima, were expressly afflicted because their evolutionary history and changed environment collided. 20 While the Pima were uniquely affected by history, the NIH studies were important because they were, according to Bennett, \"generalizable [and not] for the Pimas alone.\" 21 Likewise, William Knowler, another NIH scientist in Phoenix, said in a 1999 interview with the Arizona Republic, \"a lot of the way diabetes is treated throughout the country and the world is based on things that we learned with the Pima Indians.\" 22 It is important to note that Native peoples have not been without agency in this reframing of diabetes. Scientific knowledge derived from and produced within indigenous spaces and bodies was later used by Natives to promote and protect their own health. In a 1980 memo, the US Indian Health Service urged tribal governments to create diabetes education and prevention programs based on the NIH's findings. Chuck Raymond, a noted Native artist and member of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, created posters and brochures in the late 1970s touting traditional foods, exercise, and portion control for the Swanson Center for Nutrition, an Omaha-based clinic devoted to Indian health care. Some initiatives, like the Zuni (Pueblo) Diabetes Project in New Mexico, became models for best practices for communities across North America. 23 But an unintended consequence of scientific studies on Native communities was to reshape popular narratives about ill health and progress. Journalists and publicists for the NIH alike sometimes reinforced crude tropes of primitive Indians, labeling the Pima as \"living laboratories\" whose scientific utility came from their seeming helplessness before the onslaught of development. 24 One 1996 NIH publication, The Pima Indians: Pathfinders for Health, compared the Pimas' willingness to participate at the forefront of scientific exploration to their ancestors' roles as US Army Calvary scouts during the Mexican-American War or as guides for white American emigrants during the California gold rush. The Pima were folded into one of America's foundational myths, the frontier experience, a story that mixed environmental and racial metaphors to explain, if inconsistently, both progress and decline. 25 The upshot of such representations, which were reproduced in other scientific studies and popular accounts of that research, was the icon of the diabetic Indian. Further variations of the same stereotype emerged as well: the diabetic black, the diabetic Mexican, and so on. By the late twentieth century, the face of diabetes in America had morphed from an affluent Jew into a person of color, probably poor, from an inner-city neighborhood or an isolated rural hamlet. 26 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 684, "end": 685, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 854, "end": 856, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1347, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1856, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3026, "end": 3028, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3551, "end": 3553, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3891, "end": 3893, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4160, "end": 4162, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4505, "end": 4507, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4868, "end": 4870, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5340, "end": 5342, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5971, "end": 5973, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6143, "end": 6145, "text": "21", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6393, "end": 6395, "text": "22", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7226, "end": 7228, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7611, "end": 7613, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8131, "end": 8133, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8604, "end": 8606, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NATIVES AND DIABETES"}, {"text": "These new stereotypes were extensions of the idea of diabetes as a disease of civilization and have prompted further research into the riddle of escalating incidence and prevalence, particularly type 2 diabetes. Despite the widespread appeal of genetic explanations, the role of a degraded environment has received increased attention in the past two decades, often to explain the disproportional effect on minority groups and the poor. There are three main lines of inquiry, all of which probe how our human-built, eco-technological world may have changed our bodies as well as our environments, creating what social epidemiologist Nancy Krieger has called \"embodied inequalities.\" 27 First, renewed attention to dietary changes, like the widespread consumption of simple carbohydrates, has led some researchers to question the long-held assumption that all calories are metabolically equal. Not surprisingly, diets high in added sugar have been found to be more commonplace in poor and minority communities where access to fresh unprocessed food is often difficult or expensive. 28 Second, research into what scientists call \"allostatic load\"-the persistent accumulation of stress within the body-suggests that stressors can affect the automatic nervous, adrenocortical, and endocrine systems. Taken alone, allostatic load may not cause diabetes directly. In combination with poor diet and inadequate health care, dangerous environmental conditions, from familial strife to financial insecurity to racial discrimination, can literally get under the skin, spur unnecessary insulin production, and produce diabetes. Allostatic load is perhaps another expression of what Rob Nixon calls \"slow violence,\" a kind of \"delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space.\" 29 Finally, beginning in the 1990s, endocrinologists and public health scientists began linking exposure to chemicals broadly called endocrine disruptors that mimic the functions of human hormones like insulin to a host of health problems including diabetes. While this research remains disputed, the leading professional association of hormone scientists, The Endocrine Society, has publicly criticized the US Food and Drug Administration for failing to warn or safeguard consumers. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates, pointing to the evidence that communities of color and the poor suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards, have added exposure to diabetogenic and obseogenic chemicals to their litany of concern. 30 CONCLUSION: THE PARADOXES OF PROGRESS All of these potential pathways, individually or in combination, may also be helping to entrench and reproduce diabetes within particular populations through epigenetic regulation of genetic codes. Put simply, the patterns of inequality that yielded disproportionate incidence and prevalence of diabetes may be persistent and growing. As one pair of endocrinologists argued in 2011, \"the synergy of coexisting poverty, poor education, and pollution likely contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases\" like diabetes, creating what they call a \"paradox of progress.\" 31 Central to this paradox is an expanded sense of what counts as \"the environment.\"", "cite_spans": [{"start": 683, "end": 685, "text": "27", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1083, "text": "28", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1778, "text": "29", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHANGE AND EMBODIED INEQUALITIES"}, {"text": "These paradoxes are now attracting the attention of historians and scientists alike.

Diabetes is perhaps better understood as a spectrum of related diseases, with some physicians and scientists arguing that each variant is etiologically unique. With type 1 diabetes, the disease emerges when the beta cells of the pancreas are unable to produce the hormone insulin, which regulates how the body's cells metabolize or store glucose, their primary fuel. In type 2 diabetes, which is far more common, cells no longer have the capacity to take insulin across the cell membrane. The beta cells go into overdrive, producing more insulin than normal because tissues where the body stores glucose-primarily the liver and fat-cannot accept insulin across cell walls. The consequence is a cascading process whereby the overproduction of insulin drives further weight gain, further insulin \"resistance,\" and many horrifying complications as a result.

This essay examines two of these-Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7-and argues that these pathogens emerged in specific niches created by industrialized food systems. While specific developments in food processing, production, and consumption, including large-scale feedlots and rising antibiotic use, are responsible for some of the critical genetic developments in the pathogen's history, I suggest that foodborne pathogens have both an environmental and an evolutionary history.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chris Otter"}, {"text": "Ergotism, a disease of rye caused by a parasitic fungus, haunted medieval and early modern Europe.

It manifested itself in two forms: convulsive and gangrenous. It was a spectacular and disturbing condition, generating hallucinations and leaving victims maimed and disabled. These terrible inexplicable bodily phenomena were, according to some scholars, responsible for numerous witchcraft panics in Europe and North America. 2 Today, however, ergotism is practically nonexistent. The fatal combination of damp climates, deep poverty, reliance on a single crop, and poor storage facilities, which forced peasants to devour every last grain of rye, has vanished.

Food usually moved over relatively short distances, and it was hoarded as insurance against famine. Temperature control and preservation techniques were limited to natural ice, subterranean caves, pickling, air drying, salting, or smoking. Hence ergotism was produced within a very particular agro-food system, in which defenses against fungi, putrefaction, and pests were minimal. Food was frequently consumed when stale, moldy, or rotting; \"freshness\" was not a concern for the medieval consumer. 5 Agriculture itself utilized decomposing organic matter for fertilizer while trades like leather making utilized urine and dung. Ergotism represented the dark side of what Andr\u00e9 Guillerme called the \"fungal economy\" of the medieval period. 6 This eotechnic food system was slowly dismantled from the eighteenth century, and a new food system (or set of food systems) replaced it. These new systems were increasingly driven by fossil fuels, which enabled food to be distributed more effectively and over longer distances. There was a slow, uneven shift from an \"eotechnic\" system to a \"paleotechnic\" one, or from an \"organic\" system to a \"mineral\" one. 7 This carried the history of food systems over the threshold of the Anthropocene. The ensuing high-energy food economy reduced reliance on local accumulations of rotting food, increased the mobility of foodstuffs, and facilitated their collection in centralized processing hubs such as mills, refineries, and abattoirs. This simultaneously liquid and concentrated agro-food system would, however, have remained \"fungal\" without the later nineteenth-century development of reliable mechanical refrigeration, insulation technologies, and humidity control. Microbial proliferation could thus be retarded. Technologies of atmospheric management permeated the food system, knitting together abattoirs, railways, storage depots, and domestic spaces, producing \"cold chains.\" Pasteurization made bacterial survival and growth even more difficult.

Microbiologists call such bits of DNA bacteriophages, plasmids, and transposons. 38 Bacteria can also change through DNA deletion, thereby producing what are called \"black holes.\" 39 The \"relentless evolution\" of the E. coli species is widely attested. 40 Indeed, few microorganisms have been so well studied.

They have traced the various ways in which the pathogen acquired its deadly characteristics. First, E. coli acquired two shiga toxins through horizontal gene transfer. According to some studies, one was acquired before the divergence and one after. 41 These helped the microorganism protect itself from protozoa grazing in ambient intestinal space. 42 It also acquired the ability to cause hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells) from a plasmid. Another emergent acquisition was the capacity to produce attachment and effacement lesions, which enable the pathogen to stick to the surface of the small intestine and generate fistulae through which shiga toxins enter the bloodstream, producing a cascade of symptoms that can culminate in death. This comes from a \"pathogenicity island\" acquired from another plasmid. 43 E. coli O157:H7 has gained the ability to scavenge large amounts of iron, something necessary for its pathogenicity. 44 The microbe has also lost a considerable amount of genetic material, including DNA that inhibited virulence. 45 In short, E. coli O157:H7 did not emerge fully formed but developed instead as a result of a series of evolutionary events.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 216, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 435, "end": 437, "text": "38", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 534, "end": 536, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 607, "end": 609, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1221, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1321, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1915, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2027, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "L.

The hamburger itself is a relatively new food product, sometimes containing the meat of hundreds of animals, whose ground and particulate nature allows pathogens originally caking the surface to be distributed throughout the meat. 48 Food preparation techniques (drunken or cavalier grilling or failing to clean knives, for example) exacerbate the risk. Like sausages in the late nineteenth century, hamburgers became objects of significant unease in the 1980s and 1990s. 49 A more significant environmental factor is the transformed landscape of meat production associated with the \"livestock revolution.\" 50 Bigger but more genetically homogeneous cattle populations, subjected to intense biological strain, have become increasingly agglomerated in massive feedlots and industrialized slaughtering complexes. 51 Fossil fuel-driven food chains then disperse meat over great distances: E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks soon occurred in Argentina, South Africa, and Japan. 52 Like the SARS coronavirus studied by Andrew Price-Smith, E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogen of the age of intercontinental air travel. Abattoir facilities, particularly pre-slaughter lairages, provide a perfect milieu for contamination.

He failed to note that \"modern improvements\" in the food system were in a sense responsible for both arresting ergotism while accelerating other forms of pathogenic evolution. High-energy transportation systems and industrialized slaughter, along with transformations in animal feeding, was producing new agro-food ecologies whose manifold niches allowed new microorganisms to circulate rapidly, find new niches, gain virulence, and cross species barriers. 60 Meanwhile, mass catering, food processing, and food preparation practices also amplified the risks of novel foodborne pathogens, while an increasingly aging population was becoming immunosenescent and hence particularly vulnerable to these infections.

Similarly, Klingle argues that affluence may result in shifts in the material and dietary regime of a body politic, which in turn results in the spread of diabetes. Walker's article argues that the construction of technologically sophisticated spaces can result in toxicity (through asbestos) that undermines the health of the population.

The advent of trade along the Silk Road from Europe to East Asia facilitated the emergence of the Black Death (Yersinia pestis) from its animal reservoirs in central Asia. The trade caravans created host-vector-pathogen relations that favored the proliferation of the bacteria in Europe and East Asia, and the concentration of populations within cities of Europe favored the rapid spread of the disease there. 8 In the early 1800s, the European projection of military power into South Asia, and the consequent repatriation of soldiers, permitted the expansion of cholera into the European theater, where it spread rapidly along riparian trade routes to engulf the continent during the 1830s. Perhaps the most intense example of microbial evolution associated with ecological change occurred during the First World War, as the H1N1 influenza virus mutated and became progressively more virulent in three successive waves that encircled the planet, killing over 50 million people and sickening hundreds of millions. Arguably, the very conditions of the war, namely the extreme density of human populations in cramped trenches, railroad cars, and naval ships, allowed the virus to jump from one host to another with ever-increasing rapidity. The increased rate of viral transmission is associated with the evolution of genetic traits of increasing lethality. 9 Thus the ecological conditions of the war itself facilitated this lethal manifestation of disease. 10 In recent years we have seen the emergence of pathogens that have colonized the novel ecological niches created by certain emerging technologies-for example, Legionnaires' disease that emerged in Philadelphia during the summer of 1976. In this particular case, an outbreak of disease occurred during a meeting of the American Legion at a hotel in Philadelphia where 189 individuals were sickened and 29 perished. A subsequent investigation determined that a novel strain of bacteria, Legionella pneumophila, had colonized the airconditioning cooling towers of the hotel in question and used the AC system to then colonize human hosts. 11 Thus the advent of Legionella represents another example of microorganisms colonizing novel technological systems.

Thus in cattle the prion-induced destruction of the brain resulted in mad cow disease. Prions spread via technologies that recycled animal ruminants back into feed for cattle and sheep, which allowed for the spread of prions throughout livestock primarily in Europe. Human ingestion of infected foodstuffs (meats) then led to the colonization of human hosts by prions and the proliferation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, which saw the rapid destruction of brain tissues resulting in the death of the human host. Global trade in such feed throughout the 1990s then allowed for the emergence of prion disease (BSE) in various other countries around the world (including Canada and the United States). In this particular case, the extraordinary violation of ecological principles, namely feeding infected remains of diseased cattle to other cattle, and then feeding those subsequently infected cattle to humans, resulted in a chain of prion transmission that would not have occurred in the natural world.

Nash rightly critiques those champions of modernity who assume a distance between the natural world and the constructed world. 15 The SARS epidemic illustrates that disease is not simply a consequence of the inequitable distribution of wealth, either globally or within societies. The SARS coronavirus took advantage of changes in the relationship between its natural hosts and the human ecology of East Asia and then spread via posh hotels, jet airliners, and technologically advanced hospital environments.

The case of SARS also illustrates the paradoxical and dualistic role of modern technology in the face of novel outbreaks of contagion. Communications technology exhibited positive effects in the containment of SARS: text messages and cell phones conveyed warnings from within China, facilitated the networked response of the WHO through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and assisted in the accurate diagnosis of the pathogen.

One of these dangerous bacteria is VRE, which is now entirely resistant to vancomycin, one of our drugs of last resort (see figure 1 , Supplementary Material). VRE proliferates within hospital environments and exhibits a very high mortality rate. However, one of the worrisome propensities of VRE is that it appears to be able to pass its genetic qualities to drug resistance to other types of bacteria. Because of this, resistance to vancomycin has now been observed in other bacteria such as VRSA. 20 MRSA is another bacterium that has become resistant to many antibiotics (see figure 2 , Supplementary Material). MRSA is rather common in hospital environments because health care workers often inadvertently transmit it. Fortunately, rates of MRSA infection have declined in the United States since 2010, largely due to increased medical attention to the issue. 21 Both of these resistant bacteria have emerged as the product of the overmedicated societies of the West, where the ubiquitous overuse of antibiotics (in both humans and livestock) has generated this new class of resistant bacteria. Most worrisome is the emergence of NDM-1, which is a product of the massive overuse of antibiotics and of medical tourism. The year 2010 saw the advent of NDM-1, which is a genetic sequence that is easily transferred among various types of bacteria. Whatever bacterium hosts the sequence then acquires immunity to all existing antibiotics. This gene sequence, which emerged out of India and spread across the globe, has been transferred across various types of bacteria and into both animal and human hosts. 22 As NDM-1 continues to proliferate through the bacterial world, many previously treatable diseases may increasingly prove to be incurable, resulting in increasing morbidity, mortality, and fear.

The traditional, and reductionist, view was that virulence was a function either of the pathogen or of the host. 27 However, we now know that complex interactions between multiple variables can affect virulence through processes of emergence. For example, the Great Influenza pandemic of 1917-19 exhibited marked increases in pathogenic virulence, which would seem to have resulted from properties of emergence. As the three major viral waves cascaded around the planet during this time period, each wave coincided with a marked increase in the virulence of the virus. 28 Recent research in the domain of virology suggests that as the viral speed of transmission accelerates, the virulence of that same pathogen increases. This is because, under diminished speed of viral transmission, the pathogen must keep its human host alive long enough to jump to a new host; thus traits of lethality are selected out. However, under scenarios of rapid viral transmission, such traits of virulence remain intact, and the pathogen in question may consequently evolve to become increasingly lethal. 29 One might then also consider the advent of the plagues of affluence as the result of emergent properties, where changing ecosystems and shifting technological landscapes combine to allow for the emergence of previously unknown pathogens such as SARS, VRE, BSE, MRSA, and NDM-1. The SARS epidemic clearly exhibited emergent properties in that it featured a novel zoonotic pathogen that leaped from its natural animal reservoirs into the high-density populations of southeastern China, whereupon it became endogenized in the human ecology of East Asia. It was then distributed via airplane travel throughout the region and thereafter to Canada. SARS was also transmitted in a nosocomial fashion, such that it flourished in the contained medical infrastructures of the developed world.

For example, the use of antimicrobial cleaning agents in households may wipe out 99.9 percent of an existing bacterial population on a given surface. The small population of bacteria that survive will exhibit some small genetic variance that distinguishes them from those that perished, and the survivors will simply flourish over time to colonize the previously sanitized environment.

Eventually, they made their way to the 7th Precinct, in Manhattan's Lower East Side, along with a convoy of police officers and firefighters. As Valentin and his colleagues approached the swirling dust storm, a gray figure emerged from the plume, like a ship silently ghosting through the fog. It was a lone woman, staggering as she walked toward him. Valentin remembered that her \"face was covered with powder except for circles around her eyes.\" He recalled, \"You could see the look of horror in her face.\" When he asked if she needed help, she mumbled that she was going to walk over the Williamsburg Bridge and then home. 1 She then disappeared into the dust cloud as quickly and silently as she had appeared. One common memory that many first responders share about those initial hours was the \"powder\" that At 5:20 that afternoon, as Valentin and his colleagues started working at Ground Zero, the forty-seven-story 7 WTC building, which had survived the original attacks, collapsed. \"I could not believe what I was seeing with my own eyes,\" he testified to the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. \"During the next few months, working in and around the World Trade Center site, I saw things that were unimaginable-the sights, sounds and smells of those months were burned into my memory for the rest of my life.\" Valentin served as part of a team that worked in and around Ground Zero for months. They performed security duties, served on bucket brigades, conducted door-to-door searches, retrieved human body parts from surrounding buildings, and moved equipment and supplies. It was, he explained, \"like one long nightmarish blur from beginning to end.\" 2 During his work at Ground Zero, Valentin had one physical examination that included a chest x-ray. As he reported to the Judiciary Committee, \"my lungs were clear, and I was healthy, as I had always been up until 9/11.\" But Valentin began having serious health problems two years after the event. He suffered from intractable lung and sinus infections, as well as a painful searing sensation inside his ears. In 2004 Valentin began experiencing night sweats, and in September, on his fortieth birthday and three years after the Twin Towers collapsed, doctors discovered a large tumorous mass in his chest between his aorta and trachea. They told him it was likely lymphoma. The mass turned out to be benign, but while physicians examined his lymph nodes they discovered disturbing black particulates. Shortly thereafter, doctors diagnosed him with gallbladder problems and, when they surgically removed his gallbladder, they discovered another lymphatic tumor. While treating the tumor, doctors noticed that his lung functions had diminished, and he was diagnosed with a dangerous thickening of the pleural lining of his lungs. All told, doctors have since diagnosed this once healthy cop with gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophagitis, sinusitis, and a host of other serious conditions. Similarly, Valentin's partner, Ernest Vallebuona, has since been diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma. As Valentin explained to The Guardian, \"We all have terminal illnesses, we are all going to die.\" 3 Of Valentin's numerous health concerns, the thickening of the pleural lining of his lungs is perhaps the most alarming because it is an early symptom of mesothelioma, an extremely rare lung cancer indisputably linked to asbestos exposure, according to health experts. Mesothelium is the thin membrane that lines the body cavity, and mesothelial tissue also covers many critical organs including the lungs. As malignant mesothelioma occurs in this tissue it can be excruciatingly painful, particularly as fluid accumulates in the pleural space, a condition known as pleural effusion. Clinically speaking, the relationship between mesothelioma and asbestos is so solid that many experts consider it a \"sentinel\" cancer.

Asbestos was pulverized into pieces so tiny that ordinary tests devised to track the fibers missed them.\" 6 As one scientist commented, the fires \"produced a multitude of additional chemicals and physical changes in the materials that were released.\" These fires generated an \"additional series of highly toxic and noxious substances.\" 7 The WTC dust plume was more than the sum of its parts: as it swirled in Lower Manhattan it took on its own hybrid toxicological qualities, ones that reject reductionist answers to what caused Valentin's cancers. Inorganic chemistry, as it produced transformations under the historical circumstances of global terrorism, became an agent in this historical narrative. With WTC dust, hybridity, as Bruno Latour would suggest, was not simply the results of the intertwining of the politics, science, technology, and nature that encompassed the 9/11 event, but rather about the material hybridity that occurred in the multicausal fires of this specific historical moment (see figure 2 ). 8 Subsequently, Lower Manhattan's ecologies of terrorism have become one of the \"most intensely studied and sampled environments on the planet.\" And the lungs of first responders are among the most monitored in the world, with over eleven thousand people having received chest x-rays and other forms of physical examinations. 9 Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) officials insisted that Lower Manhattan was safe to return to only days after the WTC came crashing down. \"Given the scope of the tragedy from last week,\" EPA Administrator Christie Todd Whitman infamously announced one week after the disaster, \"I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C., that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink.\" 10 But critics, such as Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, believed that officials put the health of financial markets ahead of the health of residents. Specifically, regarding asbestos exposure, Shufro explained, \"Those exposures may have grave adverse public health consequences, but we will not know exactly what those consequences are for decades.\" 11 In part, the debate regarding the residual health risks of WTC dust stems from testing technologies and protocols. The EPA used antiquated testing protocols while private researchers used the latest in electron microscopes and fiber-counting procedures.

The best thing they could do is transfer you to Alaska.\" 12 With TEM equipment, researchers often counted nine fibers for every one counted by EPA Region 2 scientists. Making a chilling connection to Montana, Jenkins acknowledged that, in light of the more accurate testing, \"The concentrations of asbestos in both settled dusts inside homes in Libby is comparable to the settled dusts inside the buildings in lower Manhattan.\" 13 In essence, the ecologies of terrorism had reduced Lower Manhattan to a Superfund site, and Jenkins lost her job for explaining as much.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1614, "end": 1615, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1941, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2784, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3518, "end": 3520, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3889, "end": 3891, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1602, "end": 1610, "text": "figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "ENVIRONMENTS OF TERROR"}, {"text": "Using TEM and other sophisticated equipment, however, scientists have identified the basic global anatomy of WTC dust (see Figure 1 , supplementary material).

Because of its critical role in fire prevention, one mineralogist could trumpet, \"Asbestos may be termed indispensable to modern life.\" 24 It certainly became a ubiquitous part of modern life. Before spray-on asbestos insulation, large steel beams had to be pretreated with cement coating, making them large, cumbersome to transport, expensive to erect, easy to damage, and difficult to build with. Cement often sloughed off during transport, making those parts of the steel beams vulnerable to buckling under heat. The Limpet process, as the practice of spraying-on adhesive asbestos was called in Great Britain, was pioneered by the J. W. Roberts Company in 1932. British Railway coach makers used the spray-on asbestos in their railcars to control condensation and noise, and to serve as thermal insulation. The process was first used in the United States in 1935, mostly for textured decorative finishes in nightclubs, restaurants, and hotels. Because the spray-on insulation proved an effective fireproofing, by the early 1950s the National Underwriters Laboratories had approved spray-on products from both National Gypsum Company and Asbestospray Company. In 1958 spray-on asbestos insulation was used in the construction of the sixty-story Chase Manhattan Bank building in New York City. By 1970 over half of the multistory building erected in the United States had asbestos spray-on insulation guarding their towering steel skeletons. 25 In the face of the grim reality of deadly urban fires, asbestos was indeed a promising breakthrough. Usually, spray-on insulation contained 5 to 30 percent commercial-grade chrysotile asbestos, mineral wool, adhesives, and binders such as bentonite and synthetic resins. By 1968 an estimated 40,000 tons of spray-on asbestos insulation was being used in the United States. Engineers slated the Word Trade Center, constructed between 1968 and 1973, to hold about 5,000 tons of spray-on insulation. In fact, spray-on insulation was critical to the architectural vision of the WTC complex. With insulation, engineering plans required a much smaller footing because the bearing load was reduced, shorter construction time because there was less concrete formwork involved, the spray was more easily applied to irregular surface configurations and architectural shapes, and it saved money. Because steel loses its strength at approximately 1,100 F (590 C), spray-on insulation was critical for the fire rating of multistory buildings. It made sense for the construction of the 110-story WTC, where, on the best of occasions, evacuating the entire complex took several hours (see figure 3 ). 26 However, both building and destroying the WTC prompted debates regarding asbestos in built environments. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Twin Towers had become Ground Zero for another important event: the debate over the health risks associated with asbestos insulation. In 1964 Irving Selikoff of Mount Sinai Hospital and two colleagues published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association linking lung cancer to working with asbestos insulation. The landmark study examined the health of some fifteen hundred members of the Asbestos Workers Union in the New York metropolitan area, as well as two local affiliates of the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers. The results determined, \"For the period 1953-1957, there were 85 observed deaths compared with 56.6 expected deaths, and for the period 1958-1962, there were 88 observed deaths compared with only 54.4 expected deaths.\" More strikingly, of 632 insulation workers tracked, forty-five died of lung cancer, including three cases of mesothelioma, when only six such deaths were expected. In other words, people are always expected to die, but not in the numbers that these \"laggers,\" \"insulators,\" or \"pipe coverers\" were dying, and not from rare forms of lung cancer such as mesothelioma. 27 With this study, Selikoff and his colleagues focused attention on the dangers of asbestos use in insulation application, just at the time that it was becoming, as we have seen, \"indispensable to modern life.\"", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1597, "end": 1599, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2786, "end": 2788, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4100, "end": 4102, "text": "27", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2774, "end": 2782, "text": "figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "FIREPROOFING VERTICAL ENVIRONMENTS"}, {"text": "Then, in another important study in the American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal, Selikoff and his colleagues focused their attention on the dangers of spraying insulation in particular.

While builders erected the WTC complex, studies indicated that, because of the overspray with the insulation, some five tons of chrysotile asbestos was being released into the surrounding built environment. 28 That overspray was contaminating air around the Twin Towers, the site of the actual spraying, raised serious health concerns. In 1971 researchers including Selikoff had conducted postmortem biopsies of twenty-eight New Yorkers and determined that twenty-four of them, or 85 percent, had chrysotile asbestos fibers lodged in their lungs. 29 Asbestos was already becoming a part of the bodies of New Yorkers at an alarming pace.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 688, "end": 690, "text": "28", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1030, "text": "29", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FIREPROOFING VERTICAL ENVIRONMENTS"}, {"text": "In the face of growing evidence that asbestos was killing insulation workers and contaminating the New York metropolitan area, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took the precautionary step of halting the use of asbestos-based spray insulation on the WTC.

The halting occurred two years before the New York City Council passed a law that banned spray-on insulation on February 25, 1972 . Nonetheless, before the Port Authority took this precautionary step, insulators had sprayed insulation, containing some 20 percent chrysotile asbestos, on Tower 1 (North Tower) up to the thirty-eighth floor. Above this point, insulators applied a supposedly asbestos-free alternative. The entirety of Tower 2 (South Tower) was also sprayed with the \"asbestos-free\" alternative.

One year later, the EPA, as part of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, followed suit and banned spray-applied asbestos fireproofing and insulation, largely in response to studies surrounding the construction of the Twin Towers. 31 As companies scrambled to design asbestos-free alternatives, W. R. Grace announced a dramatic \"research breakthrough.\" In the face of the New York City and EPA bans on spray-on asbestos fireproofing, the company had designed a \"completely asbestos-free\" product, one whose \"health and environmental aspects are overpowering.\" Actually, as the New York Times reported, the product was a familiar name in the spray-on insulation world, a product called Monokote. 32 In 1968 W. R. Grace had won the contract to fireproof the steel columns of the WTC. The product to be used, Monokote-3, contained a mixture of 12 percent commercial grade chrysotile asbestos, 30 percent of Libby's low-grade vermiculite, and gypsum. \"In an effort to provide the proper fire protection and provide heat flow into the column it was felt that a dense vermiculite-gypsum plaster could best fulfill the needs\" of engineers, claimed one W. R. Grace document, titled \"Study of the Interior Fire Protection Requirements of the Exterior Columns of the World Trade Center Project.\" In this earlier version of the Monokote product, Libby's vermiculite provided the fireproofing, but because the company used grade-three vermiculite in the mix, it probably contained somewhere between 5 and 15 percent tremolite asbestos, as well as the industrial-grade chrysotile asbestos.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 519, "text": "31", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 981, "end": 983, "text": "32", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE GRACE RULE"}, {"text": "But following the research of Selikoff and others, engineers stopped using asbestos-containing fireproofing on Tower 1 at the thirty-eighth floor.

However, despite W. R. Grace's assurances and reassurances, Monokote-4 did have discernable levels of tremolite asbestos, about 1 percent. The principal reason that asbestos was used in Monokote was that it eased the spraying process by keeping the finicky nozzles from clogging. This led to what some call the \"Grace rule.\" The company managed to convince the EPA that it needed 1 percent asbestos to keep Monokote spraying, and that 1 percent asbestos did not represent a health threat to sprayers or other workers. Regardless, by 1977, Monokote was the leading fireproofing material in the United States. Workers had sprayed it on 60 to 80 percent of the 150,000 steel-columned structures built in the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1980s, Monokote, and Libby's tremolite asbestos, was everywhere. 33 Typically, W. R. Grace has denied that its fireproofing products were used on the WTC project, but Hyman Brown, the project engineer, rejects those denials. \"So I can tell you right now that [Monokote-3] was used in the first building, most of the first building, and [Monokote -4] was used for the rest of the first building and the second building because we were told that [Monokote-4] did not have asbestos in it,\" he has explained in interviews with Andrea Peacock.

Justifiably excited by new scientific knowledge that links environments ever more strongly to health and disease, environmental historians have not, for the most part, looked very hard at the contexts that have generated that knowledge. We have been down this path before. Early environmental histories were jeremiads that drew their strength from a Clementsian ecology that emphasized stability and climax-even though that was hardly the only ecological paradigm available at the time. As the trajectory of the field makes clear, too close a reliance on certain natural sciences leads to histories that quickly become period pieces. 8 The displacement of Clementsian ecology had its benefits. Arguably the most important development within the field of environmental history over the last two decades has been its engagement with the history and sociology of science. The recognition that every science has a history of its own and emerges within overlapping fields of power relations (from the scale of the laboratory to that of the globe) should at least give historians pause when they turn to science to authorize their narratives-whether of landscape change or disease occurrence. Contrary to popular belief, the choice is not between an uncritical acceptance of scientific truth and science denial. There is a middle ground in which we can view science as generating powerful and useful knowledge while acknowledging the contexts that shape it. Who participates in its development? What kinds of projects are funded? What questions get asked? What kinds of answers are legitimated? Moreover, modern science is itself more diverse and conflictual than historians typically acknowledge; there is always more than one science to choose from. Klingle's acknowledgment of the longstanding controversy surrounding Neel's \"thrifty genotype\" hypothesis points, for example, to the diversity of opinions within the medical community and to much earlier challenges to racial explications of disease among Native Americans-an issue that Christopher McMillen has deftly explored with respect to tuberculosis. Even as modern science has grown more diverse and complex, our histories too often have not. 9 There are important exceptions. Christopher Sellers's now classic history of toxicology links the rise of this new science in the early twentieth century to the emergence of modern chemical corporations and the aspirations of a new group of university-based scientists who depended on corporate funding. Although toxicology remains the dominant science of chemical regulation to which environmentalists and citizen activists appeal, Sellers's work offers us a more critical perspective on both its history and its potential. 10 More recently, Sellers has looked at how the scientists in different national contexts (the United States, Western Europe, and the USSR) assessed toxic effects and came to strikingly different conclusions about chemical dangers during the Cold War. In particular, Soviet scientists focused on more subtle effects that American scientists neglected, such as impacts to the central nervous system; as a result, Soviet health standards were typically more protective than those in the United States, by as much as an order of magnitude. Similarly, Kate Brown has written about the Soviet diagnosis of \"chronic radiation sickness,\" which emerged in the mid-1950s to describe a cluster of nonspecific symptoms (chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, premature aging, aching joints) associated with ongoing exposure to radiation both within and downwind of nuclear production facilities. Whereas the closed society of the USSR allowed the government to gather massive amounts of data on populations exposed to radiation, American officials studiously avoided collecting this kind of information because they feared generating popular opposition to nuclear weapons production as well as exposing the government to legal liability. Moreover, as Brown relates, when American scientists came to dominate radiation health research after the Cold War, the diagnosis of chronic radiation sickness disappeared from the literature. Her work, along with that of Sellers, shows how scientific representations express \"their own nation's current configuration of workplace power relations,\" which are, in turn, the outcome of particular social and political histories. 11 These works reveal that even those sciences that generate a more \"environmental\" perspective have a context and history that require critical illumination. Disease ecology is no exception. Its emergence in the first half of the twentieth century was \"contingent upon the vagaries of global capital, commerce, and war,\" as well as the environmental legacies of colonialism. 12 What are the contexts that have renewed the interest in disease ecology, and how are the forces and institutions of shaping that science today? How are modern disease ecology and epidemiology, with their close connections to genetics, similar to and different from their earlier incarnations in the mid-twentieth century? 13 And what are the political, economic, and institutional contexts that are shaping their current trajectory?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 778, "end": 779, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2342, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2870, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4518, "end": 4520, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4894, "end": 4896, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5219, "end": 5221, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HISTORY AND SCIENCE"}, {"text": "In addition, environmental historians should have more to say about the material contexts on which modern biomedical science depends. Knowledge, too, has its environmental costs-particularly modern scientific knowledge. 14 Perhaps most politically controversial and thus most visible is the reliance of biomedicine on massive numbers of nonhuman animals. Much of our scientific knowledge about diseases like E. coli, SARs, type 2 diabetes, and asbestosis has relied on the production and global circulation of specific strains of mice, rats, ferrets, and rhesus monkeys for laboratory experimentation. To the dismay of many researchers and institutional administrators, activist challenges to this research have made this animal \"resource\" increasingly visible. 15 But there are other impacts to consider. Contemporary biomedical research continues to be conducted in the usual places, precisely because those are the locations in which one is assured of the massive material resources necessary to sustain high-tech laboratories on which that science depends: reliable and abundant energy supplies, high-quality buildings, good water supplies, rare metals, radioactive and toxic materials, innumerable chemicals, and a plethora of more ordinary consumer items. The modern biomedical lab is a very particular kind of local space. Within most of the industrialized world, and certainly within the United States, both \"Big Science\" and basic research are assumed to be values in their own right that inevitably generate practical results; it borders on heresy to ask if such science is necessary or warranted, if the benefits justify the costs, or what other solutions to disease might be possible. The perpetual return to \"science\" helps to ensure the flow of dollars and resources into the laboratories, universities, and cities of the (over) developed world: to genotype new viruses, to develop new vaccines, to manipulate data, to write computer code. Moreover, in the face of global crisis, questions of inequality-along with the histories of colonialism and capitalism that have structured that inequality-are too easily relegated to the sidelines. But if the ultimate goal is improved global health, we need to recognize that the investments in these places may come at the expense of investments in basic public health and infrastructure elsewhere. Put another way, modern intellectual work, particularly in the natural sciences, has its own ongoing set of environmental and social implications, and these too need to be part of our stories. 15 For instance, the University of Washington's April 2015 decision to continue with the construction of a new $120 million \"animal research facility\" generated considerable news coverage. \"Activists Trying to Stop Work on New UW Animal Lab,\" Seattle Times, April 23, 2015, http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ education/activists-trying-to-stop-work-on-new-uw-animal-lab/.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 762, "end": 764, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2548, "end": 2550, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HISTORY AND SCIENCE"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Networks in Tropical Medicine: Internationalism, Colonialism, and the Rise of a Medical Specialty", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Neill", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "1890--1930", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The Colonial Disease: A Social History of Sleeping Sickness in Northern Zaire", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Lyons", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1992, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "1900--1940", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Sleeping Sickness, Colonial Medicine and Imperialism: Some Connections in the Belgian Congo", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Lyons", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1988, "venue": "Disease, Medicine, and Empire: Perspectives on Western Medicine and the Experience of European Expansion", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "The Power to Heal: African Auxiliaries in Colonial Belgian Congo and Uganda", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Lyons", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "Contesting Colonial Hegemony: State and Society in Africa and India", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Lords of the Fly: Sleeping Sickness Control in British Uganda", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Hoppe", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "1900--1960", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Trypanosomiasis Control in African history: An Evaded Issue?", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Giblin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1990, "venue": "Journal of African History", "volume": "31", "issn": "1", "pages": "59--80", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "The Social and Economic Effects of Sleeping", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Musambachime", "suffix": ""}], "year": null, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "The Age of Water: The Urban Environment in the North of France", "authors": [{"first": "Andr\u00e9", "middle": [], "last": "Guillerme", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1988, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF10": {"ref_id": "b10", "title": "The Character of the Industrial Revolution in England", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Wrigley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Chance", "middle": [], "last": "Continuity", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Change", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1988, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF11": {"ref_id": "b11", "title": "Food, Hygiene, and the Laboratory.

One note: Chronic diseases are deeply historical ailments. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the adjective \"chronic\" was once a synonym for chronological. Scholars and early physicians translating the works of antiquity in the early 1600s adopted the Latin chronicus, itself derived from the Greek vq\u00f3io, to also describe lingering or inveterate ill health. Etymologically speaking, \"chronic\" was historical at birth.3 Quotations from Charles E.
