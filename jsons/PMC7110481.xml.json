As of July 14, 2015, a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, have been reported to the WHO.2 MERS-CoV infection is of particular concern worldwide, not just because of its similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that hit Hong Kong and other countries in 2003, but also the importance of translating former lessons to improve infectious disease control. As tertiary, quaternary, and quinary spread of MERS-CoV have been described in outbreaks in the Middle East,4 an understanding of the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV in the current outbreak would contribute to the epidemiological knowledgebase for future reference.",

Firstly, infection within households was distinctly uncommon, accounting for only one first-generation case (wife of the index patient). Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of the outbreak, but affected largely non-healthcare workers (154/184 from the collected data); there has been no reported community spread. Secondly, the transmissions appear to have been multifocal as a result of infected patients attending more than one institution during the course of their illness. Two cases, including the index case, were reported to have visited four healthcare institutions, while three had visited three. This can be explained by the phenomenon of healthcare switching, a practice that is common in South Korea, where many adult patients may use hospital performance information to choose the service providers.5, 6 This practice, coupled with the courtesy of visiting relatives in hospitals, appears to have fuelled the rapid dissemination of the virus. Thirdly, while MERS-CoV is known to spread by droplet transmission upon prolonged exposure to and within a short distance of source patients, direct contact could only be inferred in about 10% of the cases. It was found that the majority occurred instead in people who had shared the same healthcare environment. Fomite transmission is a possibility, as MERS-CoV has been shown to remain viable on inanimate surfaces, even after an extended interval of 48 h.7 Similarly SARS-CoV RNA has been collected from hospital surfaces days after their deposition by infected patients, although the viability of this virus could not be confirmed.8 Fomite transmission was the probable explanation for the transmission of SARS-CoV to passengers not in physical proximity to the source patient on an aircraft,9 an observation that could be extrapolated to MERS-CoV in visitors to hospitals in South Korea.",

The analysis could be conducted readily without relying on the lengthy process of consulting official surveillance reports. A similar approach has also enabled another research group to report their preliminary assessment of the outbreak, an effort that would not have been possible before the internet era.10 There is, inevitably, the limitation of the validity of the epidemiological characteristics of each reported case, although much effort was made to verify the data in the course of the study. In fact the demographic profile of cases in the present study is similar to that subsequently released by the South Korean Ministry of Health (in Korean, machine translated, edited: http://www.mw.go.kr/front_new/al/sal0301ls.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=04&MENU_ID=0403). Overall, the present results suggest that effective control of MERS-CoV hinges on the upholding of infection control standards to minimize the emergence of new generations of the virus and on advising the avoidance of healthcare switching when there is a suspected infection.",
