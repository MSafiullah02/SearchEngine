            "text": "Throughout the present century there has been a steady development of methods for summarizing the large quantity of biological data obtained from river surveys. These methods, recently reviewed by Wilhm (1975) , Hawkes (1977) and Hellawell (1977a Hellawell ( , b. 1978 , usually result in the production of biotic and diversity indices. They are intended to codify the response of groups of Correspondence: Dr M. A. Learner, Department of Applied Biology. University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. King Edward VII Avenue, CardiffCF13NU. Wales. organisms to changes in water quality and have been developed principally to detect and assess pollution. Such methods are essentially pragmatic in their conception, much of the information contained within the samples remains unused, and only rarely does their use further our knowledge regarding the ecology of riverine species. Now that computers are more readily available, greater use can be made of the range of classification and ordination methods for determining species groups within large data-sets (Greig-Smith, 1964; Clifford & Stephenson, 1975; Green. 1979) . Since these methods make greater use of the information content of the samples, they are potentially a more sensitive way of identifying environmental change and ecological knowledge is likely to be advanced by their adoption. Edwards, Hughes & Read (1975) and Hamer & Soulsby (1980) showed that the objective establishment of species groups using multivariate analysis could provide a more reliable and sensitive method for identifying environmental discontinuities, especially those induced by pollution, than the use of biotic and diversity indices. However, the attractiveness of multivariate analysis for this purpose is reduced because many multivariate techniques exist and there is evidence (Williams, 1971; Pinkham & Pearson, 1976; Clarke, 1977; Hellawell, 1978) that application of different techniques to the same data-set is likely to produce different groupings of species. This clearly complicates comparison between studies where different methods have been applied and impedes wider acceptance of the species groups identified in any one study as being reliable and sensitive indicators of particular environmental conditions.",

Ely occurred at most of the sites and therefore qualitative (presence-absence) data would not discriminate between the species. This view was confirmed in an analysis of the data using Jaccard's coefficient of similarity (Jaccard, 1912) .",

This is permissible if samples are collected at random and if the correlated measures are normally distributed (Greig-Smith, 1964) . However, because the maero-invertebrate data resulting from the R. Ely survey did not satisfy this requirement the correlation coefficient was used simply to deseribe the presence of association between sets of variables. Its use in this context does not require assumptions to be made of the statistical distribution of the variables and it was unnecessary to transform the data prior to calculating the product-moment correlation coefficient. This is advantageous because transformed data may not be so easily interpretable biologically even though a transformation may be statistically appropriate (Gertz, 1978; Meeter & Livingston, 1978) . Species restricted to a few sites only are likely to be associated on the basis of their joint absence from the majority of sites. Such associations have doubtful ecological significance because different reasons could account for the absence of species from a particular site. We therefore excluded from the data matrix those species which occurred at fewer than four sites. There was no evidence that species restricted to four sites were associated on the basis of joint absences. Where a species occurred at more than four sites, any zero values were included in the matrix.",

Ward's method is most appropriately used with distance measures and therefore the nearest neighbour method was also used because of its wider applicability. Jardine & Sibson (1968 believed that this was theonly method of clustering that met all the mathematical criteria they suggested should be applied to any methtxl of cluster analysis when assessing its suitability. For this reason the nearest neighbour method of hierarchical grouping was also applied to the product-moment correlation and to Kendall's tau correlation mea.sures of association. However, nearest neighbour grouping is prone to the chaining effect (Shepherd & Willmott, 1968) in that species tend to join existing clusters because they resemble one member of the cluster although they may be very different from other members. The species associations resulting from the use of the various clustering techniques were examined carefully to make certain that the species forming the association were closely interlinked and that species were not being incorporated into the clusters by chaining. No chaining was observed in these clusters.",

It would appear sensible for groups to be joined at an average level of similarity rather than at the level of closest similarity between two species, one in each group, as occurs in nearest neighbour clustering and because of this Field & McFarlane (1968) recommended the use of average linkage clustering. Wishart (1975) observed that Euclidean-Distance coefficients are biased towards those variables (species) which have large variances. Thus, those species with very variable abundances may assume exaggerated importance in the clustering process. !n order to reduce this bias the data were standardized by subtracting the mean abundance of each species at a site from its abundance in the sample and dividing by the standard deviation. Such standardization should place more emphasis on distribution but it also means that species are being grouped more on tbe basis of their proportional occurrence than on their absolute abundance. Because of this. Squared Euclidean-Distance coefficients were also calculated using non-standardized data for comparison.",

            "text": "Baetis rhodani is noted for its tolerance of pollution by rapidly biodegradable organic matter such as sewage; mild pollution of this nature promotes an increase in numbers (Hawkes. 1979) . Ghetti & Bonazzi (1977) found this species to dominate the macro-invertebrate fauna at Langhirano on the Torrente Parma. Italy, where the water quality was similar to that of the R. Ely. It was less dominant at sites where the water quality was better or poorer than this. Less is known about the other species. Lehmann (1972) refers to \u00a3. claripennis (= E. hospita) as living principally among mosses in swift running water. Hawkes & Davies (1971) and Szczesny (1974) have observed the increased dominance of this species in reaches of rivers recovering from sewage pollution. The former authors believed that oxygen concentration was the principal factor detennining the distribution of E. claripennis, and also B. rhodani, in the river they studied. In particular, the summer inci-of both species was progressively suppressed as the amount of organic pollution increased because of the greater severity of oxygen depletion during the summer months. Eukiefferiella caivescens is also particularly associated with the presence of mosses, but generally in unpolluted rivers (learner et ai, 1971; Lehmann, 1972) . However. Wasson (1977) found this species to dominate the macro-invertebrate fauna of an organically enriched region of the Isere where Cladophora was abundant at certain times. Polypedilum and C. trifascia were particularly prominent at eutrophic sites on the R. Ely where the river was recovering from sewage pollution. Similarly, Wasson (1977) found F. laetum and C. trifascia largely restricted to organicallyenriched reaches of the Iserc. Besch & Hofmann (1968) noted that P. laettmi was particularly tolerant of organically polluted waters in the lower Steinach where it was associated with the bacterium Sphaerotilus. In the R. Ely Polypedilum (not necessarily P. laetttm itself) was the only member of Group 1 which occurred at S2 downstream of the Coedely Coking Plant.",

This is probably because KendalPs tau is calculated from the ranked values of abundance at the sites, which are very similar in this instance, whereas product-moment correlation is sensitive to differences in absolute abundance which fluctuate more widely. Hawkes & Davies (1971) demonstrated the association between large numbers of A. aquaticus and eutrophic conditions as indicated by thick growths of Cladophora. Similarly in the R. Ely highest population densities occurred where there was an abundance of filamentous plants in the eutrophic lower reaches. Thus, the grouping of A. aqtiaticus with the Group I species would appear ecologically sound although unlike the other Group 1 species It was widely distributed, relatively abundant at SI and absent from S3.",

Paracyclopsfimbriatus and the closely related P. poppei, empidids of the genus Wiedemannia, the naidid worm Pristina idrensis and the chironomid Synorthocladitts semivirens. The group was particularly dominant af SI where it formed 15% of the total macro-invertebrate population (Fig. 2) . The water at this site was relatively clean although affected by the dumping of domestic refuse into one of the upstream tributaries. Pristina idrensis and the two Paracyclops species occur in sewage filter-beds (Curds & Hawkes, 1975) . However, P. idremis was restricted to sites unpolluted by organic matter in the R. Cynon (Learner et ai, 1971 ) and, although occurringat some organically polluted sites in the R. Ely. it was most abundant at the relatively unpolluted site SI. The Paracyclops sfiecies are benthic in habit and crawl on and within the substratum. Hynes (1974) noted P. poppei occurring in sub-surface gravels along with Pristina piumaseta. In the R. Ely Wiedemannia sp. was found particularly associated with mosses and did not seem greatly affected by organic pollution. Hugjies (1975) found that Wiedemannia bi.stignui was most common at organically polluted sites on the R. Cynon. TTie association of Wiedemannia with the other Group 2 species may therefore be determined more by the distribution of aquatic mosses than by water quality. Synorthocladius semivirens appears to be typical of the potamon (Besch. Hofmann & Ellenberger, 1967; Lehmann. 1971; Brooker & MoiTis. 1980 ) but the population densities of this species are clearly enhanced in montane rivers where enrichment from sewage occurs. Szczesny (1974) recorded that this species was tolerant of gross inorganic pollution in the Kryniczanka stream in Poland where turbulence maintained a relatively high dissolved oxygen content but it is generally most abundant under conditions of mild organic pollution (Szczesny, 1974; Kownacki, 1977) , especially wbere fine-grained substrates occur. It appears that the presence of Group 2 species together is generally indicative of very miid organic enrichment.",

It is composed of the worm Nais elingtiis and the chironomids Conchapelopia melanops, Microcricotopus rectinervis [^ Nanocladius rectinervis-see Saether (1977) ] and Brillia longifurca. Nais elinguis is known to occur abundantly in shallow turbulent rivers with stony substrates which are organically polluted (Szczesny, 1974; Dumnicka & Pasternak, 1978; Learner, Lcxhhead & Hughes, 1978) especially where finer particles occur (Szczesny, 1974) . This species is, however, much less tolerant of high BOD values, low oxygen concentrations and high ammonia concentrations, related to gross organic pollution, than Tubifex tubifex, Limnodrilus hofpneisteri and Lumbricillus rivatis (Kom, 1963; Dumnicka & Pasternak, 1978) which also occur in the R. Ely. Much less is known about the response of Conchapelopia melanops to pollution. This species, living primarily on vegetation, is tolerant of a wide range of conditions, being of widespread occurrence in both upland and lowland streams and along lake shores (Lehmann. 1971; Lindegaard-Petersen. 1972) . The larvae of the other two cbironomids in Group 3 are also found predominantly on vegetation (Lehmann, 1971; Lindegaard-Petersen, 1972) . Brillia longifurca was originally considered a lake species (Thienemann. 1944) but in recent years it has been associated frequently with sewage pollution of riverine habitats (Besch & Hofmann, 1968; Hawkes & Davies. 1971; Learner et al., 1971; Szczesny, 1974) although it also occurs in unpolluted reaches (Lindegaard-Peterson, 1972) . In the R. Ely it was only found at more heavily polluted sites, even occurring at S2 downstream of the Coedely Coking Plant.",

Wye, particularly in the lower reaches (Brooker & Morris. 1980) indicate that it has been overlooked in the past. Lehmann (1971) found this species in the middle and lower course of the Fulda. In the Ely. although widely distributed, it was most abundant at organically polluted sites. Group 3 species were particularly abundant at S4 where they accounted for 15% of the total macroinvertebrate population. Above this site the main river was badly polluted by sewage-and coking-effluent and, despite substantial dilution by relatively clean water from the Nant Mychydd, water quality at S4 is poor (Table 2 ). In view of the tolerance of these species to some organic enrichment it is curious that this group was not more abundant at S7 and S8 downstream of Miskin Sewage Works where the water quality was similar to that at S4 (labie 2), A possible explanation in view of the importance of vegetation for these species is that aquatic mosses were present at S4 but not at S7 and S8. The other two sites where Group 3 species were relatively important, S3 and S6, were also characterized by the presence of mosses. The greater proportion of fine substrate at S4 (Table 1 ) may also have been beneficial for N. elinguis (Szczesny, 1974) . Group 3 species were intolerant of conditions at S2 downstream of the Coking Plant and at S5 which was particularly affected by high concentrations of coal particles and high permanganate values (Table 2 ). It is probable that phenols and other toxic substances were also present. In the Ely it would appear that Group 3 species together are indicative of mild to moderate organically polluted conditions provided suitable plants are available.",

These four were grouped together by the Squared-Euclidean Distance coefficient whatever clustering method was employed (Table 3) probably because this coefficient tended to cluster together species having similar absolute abundances or similar standardized values of abundance (standardized data). This group was much less clearly differentiated by the use of Kendall's tau or product-moment correlation. Ancylus fitiviatilis is used in biotic indices of water quality such as the Chandler's score (Chandler, 1970) as an indicator of unpolluted or virtually unpolluted waters. However, Wasson (1977) found greatest numbers of this species associated with the filamentous bacterium Sphaerotilus in the Isere and. from its presence at most sites along the lower Ely, it appears relatively tolerant of sewage pollution provided the water is well aerated. Bryce et al. (1978) noted that Ancylus was absent from those reaches of the R. Lee system where the oxygen saturation value remained below 50% for considerable periods. Limnius vokkmari is also generally considered to be intolerant of organic pollution but it did occur in reduced numbers in the middle and lower reaches of the Ely and is able to survive in places where turbulence keeps the water well aerated (Learner et al.. 1971) . Conchapelopia pallidula inhabits a wide variety of substrates (Dittmar. 1955). Learner et al. (1971) found it at all the sites they investigated on the R. Cynon including those polluted by sewage and coal particles. However, in the present study this species had a more restricted distribution (Appendix 1) particularly in the lower reaches of the Ely. Nais variabilis has frequently been found associated with sewage pollution in shallow turbulent streams and rivers (Learner c/a/., 1971; Szczesny, 1974; Kownacki. 1977) although this species may be less tolerant than Nais elinguis and N. barbata (Korn, 1963) , both of which also occur in the Ely.",

Product-moment and Kendall's tau coefficients of association indicate that the worm Nais barbata, and the chironomids Paratrichocladius rufiventris and Cricotopus bicinctus may also be part of Group 5. These three species were generally very abundant at all sites affected by organic pollution except S9 (Fig. 2) . Nais barbata often occurs abundantly in the organically polluted reaches of rivers with stony substrates especially in association with Cladophora (Learnerera/., 1978) . Both P. rufiventris and C. bicinctus similarly oecur abundantly in such environments although the filamentous alga may not necessarily be Cladophora (Hawkes & Davies, 1971; Learner et ai. 1971; Wasson, 1977) . Cricotopus bicinctus has also been found in large numbers associated with growths of Sphaerotilus (Wasson, 1977) .

The tolerance of L. peregra to sewage pollution is well known (Hawkes. 1979) probably because, being airbreathing, it is unaffected by low oxygen concentrations. Dussart (1979) observed that the abundance of this species tended to increase as the calcium, potassium and chloride (probably related to sewage pollution) content of the water increased, Lymnaea peregra was most abundant at S9 on the R. Ely where the alkalinity was the highest of any site sampled and the chloride concentration was relatively high. This site was one of the least polluted of the sites investigated (Table 3) . Glossiphonia complanata occurred at most sites on the R. Ely but was found in greatest numbers at S9. Murphy (1980) in a more recent survey of the Ely noted that high summer densities of this species occurred where the river was unpolluted or mildly polluted with sewage. Bryce et ai (1978) refer to this species as occurring in unpolluted or mildly polluted waters in the R. Lee system, and Matysiak (1976, 1978) concluded that G. complanata is less tolerant of sewage than the often co-existing leech Erpobdella octoculata. This latter species was much more abundant in the R. Ely than G. complanata but was restricted to sites 7, 8 and 9 (Appendix 1) and could not be included in the species-association analysis. Greatest numbers of E. octoculata occurred at S7 and lowest at S9 which is the converse of the pattern of G. complanata abundance. The association between G. complanata and L. peregra probably indicates some similarity in environmental response but there may also be a biotic influence in that molluscs are the chief prey of G. compUmatu (Elliott & Mann. 1979) . Young & Ironmonger (1980) have shown this species, when offered a wide variety of foods under laboratory conditions, to feed extensively on L. peregra. Gammarus pulex Is adversely affected by sewage pollution because of its intolerance of tow oxygen concentrations (Hawkes & Davies, 1971) . However, this species may be fairly numerous in the well-aerated riffles of organically enriched reaches of turbulent rivers (Hawkes, 1979 ); this appears to be the situation in the lower Ely. The water mite Hygrobates fiuviatilis was widespread In the R. Ely. The larvae are parasitic on cbironomid midges (Jones. 1967) but the host spectrum is not known. Learner ero/. (1971) also found this species to be widespread in the R. Cynon. However, highest populations in both rivers occurred at unpolluted or mildly polluted sites.",

This latter species was grouped with the ephemeroptera Baetis .scambus by the other methods, Lumbricilltis rivalis and T. tubifex often occur together in shallow turbulent rivers wherever pollution from sewage occurs (Learner et ai, 1971; Edwards et ai, 1972; Dumnicka, 1978; Dumnicka & Pasternak, 1978; Scullion & Edwards, 1980) although Dumnicka (1978) also noted the co-dominance of L. rivalis and the tubificid Limnodrilus uilekeniianus where the substrate was slimy sand rather than mud. The latter species was not found during our study although it does occur in low numbers in the R. Ely (Murphy, 1980) . The L. rivalis-T tubifex combination appears to be much less important in sewage polluted reaches of lowland rivers. It Is probable that L. rivalis is less tolerant of muddy substrates than is T. tubifex because of differences in respiratory behaviour (Berg. Jonasson & Ockelmann, 1962) . The respiratory rate of Z,. rivalis is dependent upon the environmental oxygen concentration whereas that of T. tubifex is not, except at very low oxygen concentrations. Dumnicka & Pasternak (1978) found that the abundance of L. rivalis decreased as the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased from 75 to 1.6% of the air-saturated value: T. tubifex abundance was not correlated with dissolved oxygen concentration. In the R. Ely these two species were an important component of the fauna at Sites 5-9 all of whieh were organically polluted. However, these sites were also affected by the deposition of eoal particles.",

It is likely that the L. rivalis~T. tubifex association (Group 8) indicates a common response to sewage pollution and also to an increased incorporation of fine inert material into the substratum. This group also dominates the macroinvertebrate fauna at S2 where it accounts for 76% of total abundance. This is undoubtedly partly a respKinse to sewage pollution (a stormwater overflow constantly discharged raw sewage upstream of Site 2). coupled with a tolerance of particularly high ammonia concentrations (Table 2) . Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri also occurred at S2 but although it often occurs with 7. tubifex in organically enriched rivers (Aston. 1973) and lakes (Milbrink, 1980) , the two species do not necessarily display the same pattern of quantitative response to environmental change (Brinkhurst & Kennedy, 1965; Learner et ai, 1971; Szczesny, 1974; Wisniewski, 1976; Dumnicka & Pasternak, 1978; Sarkka & Aho, 1980) .

Ely, B. .vfa/7i/7i\u00ab was the dominant ephemeropteran at Sites 1, 8 and 9 which were relatively mildly polluted by sewage whereas B. rhodani dominated at the more grossly polluted sites. Little information is available in the literature concerning the environmental requirements of B. scambus because until recently (Macan, 1979) it was considered impossible to distinguish between B. scambus nymphs and those of B. biocutatus unless the nymphs were reared or adults collected to determine which species was present. Scullion & Edwards (1980) have shown that the abundance of B. .'scambus is greatly reduced in the presence of coal particles. However, the concentrations in the river they studied were greatly in excess of those in the R. Ely and it is unlikely that the distribution of B. scambus in the R. Ely was influenced in this way. Group 7 species were a particularly important part of the fauna at S9, but their importance at SI is almost entirely due to B. scambus and at S2 entirely due to L. hoffmeisteri; therefore, it is not clear whether the grouping together of these two species has ecological support.",

This method produced some small groups that seem ecologically meaningful but the tendency was for species to be associated into one or two targe groups for which there appears to be little ecological justification. Of the less conservative methods. Ward's clustering of the Squared Euclidean-Distance coefficient based on standardized data grouped species from Robust Groups 1, 5 and 6 together whieh does not appear ecologically realistic in view of their dominance distributions (Fig. 2) whereas most of the species groups produced by the product-moment and Kendall's tau methcxls appear reasonable on the basis of the present state of knowledge about the species concerned. However, several species included in groups generated by nearest neighbour clustering of the product-moment correlation coefficient and by average linkage clustering of the Kendall's tau rank coefficient were not included when nearest neighbour clustering of Kendall's tan coefficient was used. Of the methods we compared, Kendall's tau coefficient clustered by the average linkage technique appears most likely to provide ecologically meaningful species groups. Product-moment correlation is also useful and because it is based on absolute abundance data whereas Kendall's method is based on relative abundance data, the use of the two together provides a reasonable method for determining robust groups.",

It is not surprising therefore that the speeies groups determined as a result of the present study bear little relationship to the macro-invertebrate species groups determined for the R. Cynon (Edwards et ai, 1975; Hughes. 1975; Pollard. 1977) , another river of the South Wales coalfield somewhat similar to the R. Ely. However, other aspects are also important apart from the statistical procedures adopted. Although the above authors used similar macro-invertebrate sampling techniques and the same mesh size as ourselves, data refer to different times of the year. Edwards et ai (1975) data refer to July-August, Hughes (1975) used the maximum abundance of eacb species attained during a year. Pollard's (1977) data refer to May and ours were obtained during August. Undoubtedly species associations based on quantitative data will be affected by seasonal changes in population abundance associated with the life-histories of the species involved and also with any seasonal changes in water quality (Hawkes & Davies. 1971; Frost, Chiu & Thomas. 1976; Clarke, 1977) . Season will have less effect on the structure of the species groups based on presence-absence data but as mentioned earlier for the Ely data this approach may be too insen.sitive to be useful. Hamer & Soulsby (1980) also found quantitative differences to be more important than qualitative ones when differentiating between stream macro-invertebrate faunas in their study.",

We believe the statistical establishment of species groups is an important tool for this work, as well as for detecting the presence of pollution. However, Williams (1971) points out that many procedures exist for classifying data and the problem is not so mueh one of finding a method of analysis but of choosing the most appropriate one from the many that exist. We hope this study will aid selection of an appropriate method. ",
