            "text": "In less than 10 years, the liberalisation of the European airline industry has moved flag carriers in highly competitive environment. The reason for this clearly follows from the peculiarity of this industry: airline carriers have to produce one of the most perishable goods (passenger transport) in one of the most dynamic industries. This fact has forced carriers to implement and refine practices and strategies to react promptly to the ups and downs of the demand. It is common practice that daily fluctuations are usually controlled by advanced pricing policies, called 'yield management', while long-lasting demand shifts require a reaction in terms of advanced capacity strategies, called 'tactical planning'.",

            "text": "In this paper, we focus on this second aspect. Exploring the behaviour of carriers in such a complex context seems to be very difficult unless it is based on particular situations as important demand shifts. Recently, two terrible events have characterised the world economy: the September 11 terrorist attack on the Twins Towers in New York and on the Pentagon in Washington in 2001, and the SARS epidemic in East Asia which begin in February 2003. These events have produced two dramatic crises especially in the North American and the Asian market, respectively. By analysing these two important demand shifts, we are able to detect some determinants of the carriers' conduct. In particular, we have split the carriers' conduct into short-and long-term determinants to capture information about carrier's strategies (internal policy, expectations for the evolution of the markets, etc.) and its specific characteristics (structure of the network, adjustment costs, financial situation). To be comprehensive, an analysis based on short-and longterm components needs to be both theoretical and empirical. From a theoretical point of view, we show that, if capacity variations are costly, it is optimal to base a capacity reaction on both short-and long-term profitability where the right mix depends upon the importance and duration of the shock. From an empirical point of view, we can explain the carrier's capacity choices with two variables: the passenger reduction due to the shock, and the expected profitability of the market.",

            "text": "To clarify the first point, suppose that an unexpected shock reduces the demand. A carrier can react by decreasing its offer but incurring a cost of adjustment. If the shock is brief, the carrier's choice during the crisis period is mainly based on the expected situation after the crisis. In fact, its reaction aims to limit the costs of reducing and restating the capacity. On the contrary, when there is a long-lasting shock, the carrier focuses on the crisis period as post-crisis profits are far away and their discounted value is low. Adjustment costs also induce carriers to behave strategically. In fact, a carrier that increases (or decreases less) the capacity during the crisis period, forces its competitor to reduce its capacity offer in the post-crisis period. This phenomenon is known in the literature as 'preemption'. Pre-emption reduces the reactivity of the carrier to the shock during the crisis.",

            "text": "Theoretical results are based on the assumption that carriers encounter adjustment costs in changing the network configuration, so that their choice depends on short-and long-term variables. Empirically, we observe that any modification of the flight supply involves costs. For instance, a carrier that decides to enter a new route needs to have new rights at the airport (slot), organise new staff, promote and advertise the new route, launch price actions and so on. Moreover, in the short-term, the aircraft for the new route should be moved from another route to the new one, and the logistic activity should be adjusted to the new aircraft rotations. Moreover, reducing frequencies or closing a route is a costly decision seeing that a carrier needs to change the aircraft rotations or definitely ground a plane. It is worth noting that adjustment costs are first of all set-up costs and hence are higher when carriers want to enter or expand a route than when they want to exit from or reduce it.",

In addition, closing and opening an intercontinental route imply a re-optimisation of the network, which is more complex and costly for larger carriers. Other factors such as specific network characteristics and the flexibility of the fleet, i.e. the number of aircraft that can operate both on short and long haul routes can have an impact on the importance of the adjustment costs. The existence of adjustment costs motivates the decision to change the capacity supply only few times a year and in the meantime to compete in prices. Data support our conjecture that there is a positive relation between market shares and costs of adjustment, even if this result is clearer for the North American crisis than for the Asian crisis.",

The empirical analysis confirms that there is a trade-off between short-and long-term goals among carriers facing the same crisis, for both the first and the second crisis. We may note that after the first shock, some carriers: namely British Airways and Air France, shifted from long-term to short-term reaction. There are many explanations for this unexpected result. For example, it may originate from an underestimation of the duration of the crisis in the first shock and an overestimation in the second shock. Another interpretation may be that carriers believe the American market is more strategic than the Asian market. Alternatively, high operating costs and low margins, combined with continuing turbulences have induced carriers to focus on the short-term rather than on the long term.",

This process is usually organised on three levels: 1) strategic planning: alliances, buying/selling new aircraft, anticipating new routes, usually every 1-3 years; 2) tactical planning: scheduled timing, numbers of frequencies and aircraft size, which will takes place every semester; 3) operational actions: pricing strategies and small adjustments of the network to improve operations such as reducing connections time at the hub, ad-hoc changes of the aircraft size on a few days. This process follows the short-term demand fluctuation and competitor moves. Each step of network planning is widely analysed in the literature. Chang and Williams (2002) and Janic (1997) investigate the relation between the liberalisation, alliance and performance of the airlines. Chin and Tay (2001) , Smith (1997) , and Bruning and Hu (1988) focus on the profitability and investment decision of North American and Asian carriers. Finally, Borenstein (1989) , Dresner (1995, 1999) give attention to operational choices, i.e. pricing equilibrium and market competition.",

In particular, Alderighi and Cento (2004) and H\u00e4tty and Hollmeier (2003) present a view of the airline crisis after the September 11. The first contribution is strongly related to this paper, being divided into two parts, one dealing with theoretical framework and an other with the results of the North American crisis. The second contribution originates from the internal debate in the crisis management unit at Lufthansa Airlines. In this study, it is shown that the reduction of air traffic demand was matched by industry capacity reduction. When demand declines, capacity can not be adjusted immediately due to the insufficient flexibility. These authors conclude that managing the crisis aims not only to restore the pre-crisis state but rather to form a more healthy business environment. In addition, Gillen and Lall (2003) examine shock transmission in the airline industry after September 11. Their research attempts to identify three main propagation channels: the trade effect; the alliance effect; and the wake-up call effects.",

Nevertheless, these indexes showed the same negative growth even before the crisis. These carriers were already in a capacity-reduction process, regardless of the forthcoming crisis. On the other hand, other carriers such as Air France, Aer Lingus, and SAS had an index above 100 in the third quarter, since they were registering a positive trend before the crisis.

Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two-dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. According to the World Health Organisation, during the SARS outbreak of 2003, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS; and of these, 774 died. Most of the SARS cases in Europe were among travellers returning from other parts of the world, particularly from Asia. As the main way that SARS appears to spread is by close person-to-person contact, fears of contagion and the official travel advice to defer non essential travel generated a shock in the demand, mainly for air transport to Asia and Canada. Before the epidemic spread, the RPK from Europe to Asia was still recovering from previous crises (September 11, the Afghanistan war and the October 2002 Bali terrorist attack) and showed positive growth. After these crisis, the negative trend is again evident in March (-8%), just one month after the first SARS case was reported. During the succeeding months, the demand sank (-22% in the April RPK), and reached its lowest point in May 2003 (-30%). The European carriers reaction is captured by the ASK index. The capacity adjustment started two months later in May 2003 (-15%) and continued in the next two months (June 2003 -15%, July -8%). The two indicators are plotted in Fig. 14.2. The time path is clearly affected by the two big crises, i.e. September 11 and SARS. Both negative shocks can be detected in the plotted time series; nevertheless, the effects were different in terms of both magnitude and the recovery path to the pre-crisis situations. Due to the September 11 attack, the RPK decreased to the lowest value of 7499, while the lowest point reached in the SARS crisis was even lower (6403). In the first crisis, the downturn of the RPK come in October 2001. A minor shift was registered in December 2002 due to the announcement of the Iraqi war, which generated negative expectations of travel security and economic development in the Asian areas. In the second crisis the drop was in March 2003 and became strong in April 2003. Later, in August 2003, the crisis does not seem to be completely absorbed by the market. Over the first quarter of 2003 (Jan-Mar), the carriers considered were still enjoying a phase of expansion the only exception being British Airways which was stable for almost all 2002 with an index of 81-87. In the second quarter of 2003 (Apr-Jun), ASK fell drastically for every carrier, with different magnitudes, ranging from 18% for Swiss to 8% for KLM and British Airways.",

For the North American destinations, when the coefficient PAX equals 0.61, it means that a 10% reduction of the total demand in the market induces the carriers to reduce their capacity by 6.1%. This value decreases to 4.9% for the Asian destinations. The YIELD coefficient is 5.7 for September 11 and 3.6 for SARS, which means that to have a capacity increase of 1%, the yield per passenger (average price) should increase by \u20ac12 on a flight of 6500 km for North America and by \u20ac18 on a flight of the same length for Asia. This difference increases if we take into account that the average distance from Europe to North America is 6500 km and to Asia 9100 km.

In fact, the discount factor depends on both these variables and it is not possible to separate the two effects. 21 A referee suggested that the cost of adjustment should reflect the opportunity cost. This means that fleet flexibility, network structure and other relevant variables should also be included in the explanation of the adjustment costs. In this paper we limit our analysis to consider market share as a proxy for adjustment costs, but we agree with the point. In the Asian market, British Airways has the largest market share (7.1%,) followed by Air France (4.6%), KLM (4.0%), Lufthansa (3.4%), Austrian Airlines (3%), Swiss (2.3%) Alitalia (1,8%). The relationship between market shares and adjustment costs seems less strong in the Asian market. Hereafter, we present the results of the econometric analysis. We assumed in the previous paragraphs that the YIELD variable is the measure of the long-term profitability, and the PAX variable is the measure for short-term profitability. Therefore, we can use the framework of Fig. 14.4 and by displaying the PAX coefficients of Eq. (14.17) on the horizontal axis and the YIELD coefficients of Eq. (14.18) on the vertical axis. The estimated coefficients are plotted in Fig. 14 .5. Black diamonds represent the carriers' reaction to the US crisis and the white diamonds their reaction to Asian crisis. 23 To investigate the functioning of the model, we focus on the carriers' reaction to the shock of September 11. Assuming a linking line is created between British Airways and Lufthansa, and moving out of the origin with other parallel lines, we can order the different behaviour of carriers depending on their flexibility. On the lowest line, we locate Lufthansa and British Airways. On the next lines, we locate Air France and KLM, followed by Alitalia. Aer Lingus and Iberia are located on the highest lines.",

As the crisis prediction is a strategic variable the carriers avoided as much as possible giving any external signal to the competitors. For this reason, it was impossible to collect reliable data to measure this variable. We have no choice but to assume that the theoretical model is correct, and make some kind of qualitative considerations. Combining Figs. 14.4-5, we notice that British Airways expected a much shorter duration than Lufthansa. They lie on the same line, but have opposite behaviour. Air France and Alitalia were more optimistic than Lufthansa. If it is not the case, the YIELD reaction of the two carriers should be lower than the one of Lufthansa. The same considerations can be applied to the other carriers. For example, Iberia and Aer Lingus expected a longer duration of the crisis than KLM, and KLM expected a shorter duration than that of Lufthansa. Swiss should have the shortest expected duration of the crisis but again its strategy might result from the financial problems of the company that forced its reaction in the short-term. Fig. 14.5 . Classification of firms in terms of short-and long-term reaction. The black diamonds indicate the carrier's reaction due to September 11, while the white diamonds indicates the carrier's reaction due to SARS Alternatively, we can interpret a different positioning on the line as a different evaluation of the 'strategic' importance of the market. A carrier evaluating a market as 'very strategic' has a low discount rate on this market, and hence it will focus on the long-term more than the short-term returns. This could explain the positioning of British Airways with respect to the other large carriers. Since the North American market is very strategic for British Airways, it reacts only to long-term but not to short-term aspects. Figure 14 .5 also provides a representation of carriers' conduct induced by the Asian crisis. Before analysing specifically the behaviour of the carriers, we try to emphasise the main differences between the first and the second crisis.",

A slightly different interpretation can be provided by assuming that carriers can learn from the past, and thus a sort of mimicking behaviour of carriers emerges. Hence, British Airways having had a wrong reaction to the first shock has decided to recalibrate its conduct in the second shock. KLM having been too much reactive to the PAX variable after September 11 chose to adopt a strategy similar to Lufthansa after the SARS epidemic. The same argument is valid for Swiss. Lufthansa having been right has decided not to change. A third explanation for the different behaviour in the two crises is given by the fact that Asian market is not so crucial as the North American market for European carriers. This explains the shift towards the shortterm choice of British Airways and Air France. Finally, a more fundamental explanation for the short-term attention of carriers is in the differences of the markets. The Asian market is characterised by higher operating costs and lower margins, meaning that the reduction of profitability (revenue -costs) when there is a demand shift in the short term is higher for the Asian market than for the North American market. Moreover, the crises affecting the Asian market before March 2003 (i.e. not only September 11 but also the Afghanistan war and the October 2002 Bali terrorist attack) might have induced carriers not to focus on the longterm indicators.",

Just as in the American crisis, during the SARS epidemic, we see that there were some carriers which followed the ordering as expected from the model, but there are some exceptions. Here, British Airways, KLM and Lufthansa are on the same line with Air France slightly higher and Austrian Airlines a little bit higher still. Swiss is out of the scheme and has the same behaviour as in the first shock. Financial constraints forced this carrier to focus on the short-term rather than long term.",

Austrian Airlines expected longer crisis duration than Air France. Lufthansa and KLM have similar expectations. Then British Airways expected the crisis would have a short duration. Finally, assuming that Swiss was financially constrained, its expected duration was closest to those of Lufthansa and KLM. As already mentioned, expectation of the crisis duration can be also interpreted as the strategic or non-strategic goals of the carriers. Now we compare the conduct of the four main carriers in the two situations. First of all, we observe that Lufthansa did not change its behaviour. British Airways that was very optimistic in the North American crisis has changed its strategy, and aligned with the one of other players. Also, KLM aligned with its main competitor, Lufthansa. These three carriers moved towards or kept on a balanced conduct by mixing short-and long-term goals. On the contrary, Air France did not seem to be confident of a quick recovers from the crisis and assumed a longer duration of the crisis",

            "text": "This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the conduct of European carriers during the North American and Asian crises. An important assumption of the model is the existence of positive adjustment costs, i.e. the costs required to re-expand capacity. Adjustment costs introduce rigidity in the carriers' conduct. Indeed, non-flexible carriers typically present, a small reaction to shortand long-term variables. This behaviour results from the fact that a non-flexible carrier sets high capacity levels during the crisis to push its competitors out of the market and to reduce the set-up costs of re-entering. On the other hand, flexible carriers present high responsiveness to both short-and long-term profitability. They can be small during the crisis period to reduce the losses, and free to expand in the post-crisis period. In the North American market, we observe that the conduct of non-flexible carriers is oriented to long-term profitability, while in the Asian market they have a more balanced choice. Carriers' strategies are also affected by expectations of the crisis duration and on the strategic importance of the market. If a carrier expects the crisis to have a long duration (or the market is not strategically important), then its conduct shifts to the short-term variable. If the expected duration is short (or the market is strategically important), then the carrier bases its strategy on the long-term variable.",

If we assume that carriers base their strategies only on short-and long-term gains, we see that these two variables explained 2/3 of the capacity choice in the Asian crisis but only 1/3 in the North Atlantic crisis. Hence, carriers have been more consistent in managing the Asian crisis than the North American crisis. Some more evidence comes from the behaviour of British Airways. In fact, it seems that British Air-ways modified its strategy by changing from a situation where it only cared about long-term variables toward a more balanced situation, closer to the Lufthansa/KLM strategy.",
