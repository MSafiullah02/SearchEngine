The prototype implements the pressure-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation mode (PC-CMV) with settable breathing rates, inspiration/expiration time ratios and FiO 2 modulation. Although safe, the design aims to minimize the use of technical components and those used are common in industry, so its construction may be possible in times of logistical shortage or disruption or in areas with reduced access to technical materials and at a moderate cost, affordable to lower income countries. Most of the device can be manufactured by modest technical means and construction plans are provided.",

Same as the low pressure regulators, there is an ample choice of solutions in the market. The valves should be able to draw the needed flow and allow opening pressures up to at least 100 mbar. If possible, the PEEP valve should be normally open so that in case of power failure the patient is depressurized to the PEEP pressure.",

Both columns could be equipped with a ruler and the input tube could be adjusted by more than 20 cm in height. That way keeping the water level constant it is possible to adjust PIP safety and PEEP by 20 mbar. It is important to use corrugated tubes to help on this movement/adjust.
