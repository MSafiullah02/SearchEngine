            "text": "The syndrome of acute bronchitis is most often associated with respiratory viruses, including common cold viruses, such as rhinovirus and coronavirus, in addition to more invasive viruses of the lower respiratory tract, such as influenza and adenovirus. Other viral causes of acute bronchitis include measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and herpes simplex virus.22, 104, 105 A small proportion of cases of acute bronchitis is of nonviral etiology. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, Taiwan acute respiratory (TWAR) strain, are recognized bacterial causes of acute bronchitis.53, 54 The etiologic role of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute bronchitis is not clear because these bacteria may represent resident flora of the upper respiratory tract of normal individuals. To examine the role of secondary bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of acute bronchitis, it is necessary to obtain samples from tracheobronchial trees without contamination by nasopharyngeal flora.58\n",

            "text": "During acute bronchial infection, the mucous membrane of the tracheobronchial tree is hyperemic and edematous, with increased bronchial secretion being a common feature. Although extensive destruction of the respiratory epithelium may be seen with influenza, other viral agents, such as rhinovirus, cause minimal epithelial injury.73, 121 Impaired mucociliary function is seen in patients with all infections, even in those without overt mucosal damage.59 Determining the pathogenesis of acute tracheobronchitis is complicated by several factors. Studies seeking an infectious cause frequently fail to isolate a specific pathogen. A delay in seeking medical care after the onset of symptoms, which may bring the patient to medical attention beyond the period of viral shedding, may be one explanation. Determination of a causative agent is further complicated in patients with chronic lung diseases who may have tracheobronchial colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria, including H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. An increase in serum antibody titers to bacteria associated with acute bronchitic symptoms suggests that bacteria may have a causative role, 82 although analysis of antibody coating of bacteria in sputum is not helpful.125 In addition, severity of attacks of acute bronchitis may be increased by exposure to cigarette smoke and air pollutants. These substances in association with recurrent acute bronchial infection may result in permanent injury to the bronchial tree. Some epidemiologic studies support the potential role of acute respiratory infections in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease.70, 79 The relationship between acute bronchitis and heightened airway reactivity has also been studied extensively. Increased airway reactivity and airway resistance, usually manifested as a bothersome cough, may persist for 6 to 8 weeks.43, 99 The elevated airway resistance observed after a bronchial infection is largely reversible with \u03b2-sympathomimetic and anticholinergic bronchodilators.",

The cough may be accompanied by variable amounts of hemoptysis or retrosternal pain that is often described as a burning sensation. It is usually accentuated on inspiration. Generally, the temperature is only minimally to moderately elevated. Physical examination often shows harsh breath sounds, rhonchi, and variable amounts of expiratory wheezing. Occasionally, focal areas of diminished breath sounds are present, which suggest that inspissated mucus has caused atelectasis. Atelectasis may be relieved by the use of humidifiers; bronchodilators; vigorous coughing; and, if needed, tracheal suction. Sometimes, diffuse diminution of air intake or inspiratory stridor is present. These findings indicate obstruction of major bronchi or the trachea. Most viral acute tracheobronchitis runs a benign, self-limited course. However, herpes simplex type 1 has been associated with severe febrile tracheobronchitis and respiratory failure in \u201cnormal\u201d, immunocompetent adults.104\n",

            "text": "Bronchitis may be suspected in patients with an acute respiratory tract infection associated with cough; however, bronchitis must be considered a diagnosis of exclusion because more serious diseases of the lower respiratory tract are associated with cough. A complete history should include information on exposure to toxic substances and cigarette use, epidemiologic considerations, and vaccination history. A thorough physical examination is essential to exclude other causes of cough, including cardiovascular and parenchymal lung diseases. Routine bacterial cultures of expectorated sputum are not helpful because of the sampling problem of contamination by nasopharyngeal flora and the usual technical difficulties with collecting, transporting, and interpreting an adequate lower respiratory tract sample. Occasionally, the nature of sputum may provide some diagnostic clues. For instance, except for adenovirus infections, the sputum in viral infections almost always shows a marked predominance of mononuclear cells on Gram or Wright's stain. In contrast, in bacterial infections, the sputum shows a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Mycoplasma infections are usually associated with mononuclear cells, but a predominant polymorphonuclear cell population may be present. Culture methods and a microimmunofluorescence test have been developed for the laboratory diagnosis of C. pneumoniae. The use of a gamma M immunoglobulin (IgM)-specific conjugate helps detect current infection. Patients in whom cough persists beyond the expected duration of the acute illness should have further diagnostic examination, including chest radiography, sputum cytology, and bronchoscopy, to exclude other diseases of the tracheobronchial tree and lungs.",

Factors that may prompt the use of antibiotics include patient's age, significant underlying medical illnesses, and severe or persistent (e.g., > 1 week in duration) symptoms.16 Under these circumstances, treatment with tetracycline or a macrolide to cover the suspected pathogens, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae, should be considered.16, 58 During epidemics known to be caused by influenza A virus, treatment with amantidine is recommended for patients with suspected influenza if the illness is less than 48 hours in duration.",

            "text": "An acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease is usually defined as an episodic respiratory decompensation without an objectively documented cause, such as pneumonia. The role of bacterial infection in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is controversial. Many patients are treated with antibiotics, but whether this treatment is efficacious is debatable.111 Several groups have demonstrated increased numbers of bacteria and neutrophils in sputum during exacerbations.48, 77 A causal relationship can be inferred by the appearance of an acute antibody response in serum to these bacteria and an increase in inflammatory mediators in purulent sputum.82, 109 The relationship between bacterial infection and symptoms is complicated by a high spontaneous remission rate; this can be expected because bacterial exacerbations are usually limited to the bronchial mucosa.81 In a landmark study, Anthonisen and co-workers9 demonstrated for the first time that patients could be stratified according to symptoms to predict a response to antimicrobial therapy. In patients with at least two of increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence, broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline) lead to improved clinical outcomes, fewer therapeutic failures, and a more rapid rate of lung function recovery compared with placebo. Overall, the length of illness was 2 days shorter for the antibiotic-treated group compared with the group receiving placebo. A meta-analysis of nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials of patients treated with antibiotics for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis concluded that a small but statistically significant clinical and physiologic improvement could be expected in antibiotic-treated patients.20, 41, 42, 86, 90, 92, 97\nTable 1\ndeonstrates the results in seven of the nine trials and a recently completed, large, randomized, placebo-controlled Italian trial that was not included in the meta-analysis.4 A beneficial impact of antibiotics was demonstrated in studies that included the largest number of patients. In the six trials that reported peak expiratory flow rates, an improvement of 10.75 L/min favoring the antibiotic group was noted. Although this improvement is small, it may be clinically relevant, particularly in patients with limited respiratory reserve. Design flaws in the earlier studies, such as small number of study patients, unclear selection criteria, uncertain microbiology, nonstandard evaluation criteria, and lack of stratification of patients, may account for the discrepancy in outcomes.",

Haemophilus parainfluenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis are also found frequently.3, 13, 18, 26, 27, 32, 57, 71, 78, 83 Studies utilizing the protected specimen brush technique, in which lower respiratory tract samples are not contaminated with oropharyngeal flora, have confirmed the important role in ACEB for bacterial pathogens. Organisms associated with acute exacerbations are similar (e.g., H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, S. pneumoniae, or M. catarrhalis), but quantitative cultures indicate a greater number of organisms.44, 57 The log colony count of organisms is of the same magnitude associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia, suggesting a significant bacterial load. Exacerbations can be caused by endogenous or exogenous reinfection by H. influenzae. Persistently infected patients keep the same H. influenzae strain for longer periods, and antibiotic therapy may not be effective in eradicating H. influenzae.55 In patients with AECB, there appears to be a relationship between severity of the underlying pulmonary disease and sputum bacteriology. Eller and co-workers40 have observed, that with declining lung function, prevalence of enteric gram-negative organisms and pseudomonas increases.40\nH. parainfluenzae has been isolated from sputum in as many as 41% of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Colony counts as high as 9.6 \u00d7 108 cfu/mL in sputum cultures and a serum antibody response suggest a potential role for this organism as a true respiratory pathogen.62 \u03b2-lactamase mediated amoxicillin resistance is seen in 20% to 40% of H. influenzae strains in North America and Europe and in almost 100% of M. catarrhalis strains.34, 68, 69 In a United States survey conducted between 1992 and 1993, 30% of all H. influenzae isolates were \u03b2-lactamase producing, although a few \u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative, ampicillin-resistant strains were isolated.17 Of almost 700 strains of M. catarrhalis, \u03b2-lactamase production was found in 92%. Of nearly 800 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 15% demonstrated intermediate susceptibility to penicillin, whereas 7% were penicillin resistant (MIC90 > 2.0 \u03bcg/mL).",

            "text": "Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis.103 The mucociliary system forms a primary defense mechanism of the respiratory tract against all inhaled particles, including bacteria.84 Viral infection and cigarette smoke frequently damage ciliated epithelium, which, in turn, impairs mucociliary clearance.107, 119 Mucociliary function may also be reduced by increased mucous volume, and altered mucous rheology.25, 98 Viral infections result in the release of inflammatory mediators, such as kinins, increasing local permeability that may predispose the respiratory mucosa to bacterial colonization.93 Loss of large areas of ciliated epithelium occurs during viral and bacterial infections and contributes to impaired mucociliary clearance.59, 117 Delayed mucociliary clearance affords bacteria the opportunity to multiply and attach, first to mucous and then to mucosal surfaces.116 An organism that is uniquely designed to take advantage of this is nontypable H. influenzae. It expresses pili, and piliated isolates of nontypable H. influenzae adhere to human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells very well.11, 14 Organisms such as H. influenzae produce substances that impair ciliary function, stimulate mucous production, destroy local immunoglobulins, impair phagocytic function, and damage the tracheobronchial epithelium.1, 45, 89, 108\nH. influenzae synthesizes histamine and releases an uncharacterized factor which impairs human neutrophil function.30, 102 When these bacteria loiter in the airways, a host inflammatory response is stimulated. With the movement of large numbers of neutrophils and their subsequent release of proteinases and toxic oxygen radicals, mucous production and epithelial surface damage may be enhanced.7, 31 The neutrophils are attracted by chemoattractant bacterial products.94 Proteinase enzymes, such as elastase, are released from neutrophils and can be found in the sputum of patients with chronic bronchitis.109 Progressive airway damage may occur from the products of the bacteria themselves or from the host response to these bacteria. Local host defense may be further impaired, leading to an ever-greater chance of bacterial colonization and thus further damage. This process has been termed the vicious circle hypothesis and may account for the insidious progression of airway disease.29\n",

Advanced age, significant impairment of lung function, poor performance status, comorbid conditions, and history of previous frequent exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid medications characterize a high risk group of patients. Because the cost of failure of treatment of these patients is high, an aggressive approach to treatment of this high-risk group may improve outcome. Routine antimicrobial therapy fails in 13% to 25% or more of exacerbations.15, 74 Therapeutic failure leads to increased cost of care because of extra physician visits, further diagnostic tests, and repeated courses of antibiotics. It may also lead to more hospitalizations and prolonged absence from work. Stratification of patients into risk categories may allow the physician to select targeted antimicrobial therapy to prevent some of these consequences. This approach has become increasingly more important because of increasing rates of resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy. Several stratification schemes have been proposed to improve initial antimicrobial selection.",

In patients with persistent symptoms (> 1 week in duration), a macrolide to treat the suspected pathogens, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae, was recommended. Group 2 patients had simple chronic bronchitis with minimal or no impairment of pulmonary function and without any other risk factors. Treatment was recommended because Anthonisen and co-workers9 demonstrated a beneficial effect of antibiotics. An aminopenicillin was suggested as first-line therapy for an acute exacerbation because the consequences of a treatment failure were expected to be relatively few. Group 3 patients were described as having moderate to severe chronic bronchitis. They may be elderly (> 65 years), and were likely to have frequent exacerbations (four or more/year). Treatment with antibiotics directed toward \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, such as a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second-generation macrolide, or quinolone was suggested. Group 4 was similar to group 3 but had other significant comorbid illness, such as congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or chronic liver disease.

Because no underlying lung disease is present in this group, the illness is usually self-limited and runs a benign course. Group 2 patients have simple chronic bronchitis, are younger, have only mild to moderate impairment of lung function (FEV1 > 50% predicted value) and have less than four exacerbations per year. In this group of patients, typical pathogens, including H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis are present, although viral infection often precedes bacterial superinfection. Treatment with a \u03b2-lactam is usually successful, and the prognosis is excellent. Group 3 patients are older and may have poor underlying lung function (FEV1 < 50% predicted). Alternatively, they may demonstrate only moderate impairment of lung function (FEV1 50%\u201365% predicted) but have significant comorbidity (e.g., diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease, or chronic liver disease) or experience four or more exacerbations per year. H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis continue to be the predominant organisms. In this group of patients, initial treatment failure has major implications for the patient and health-care system, including increased time lost from work, hospitalization, or both. Treatment with medications directed toward resistant organisms, such as a quinolone, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, or a second-generation macrolide should perform better than amoxicillin. Group 4 patients suffer from chronic bronchial infection with frequent exacerbations characterized by increased sputum production, increased sputum purulence, cough, and worsening dyspnea. Many of these patients have evidence of bronchiectasis if subjected to high-resolution CT scanning. These individuals tend to have a chronic progressive course, and an aggressive therapeutic approach should be offered. In addition to the usual respiratory organisms, other gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp., should be considered as potential pathogens. Ciprofloxacin is the agent with the most activity against these species and should be considered the agent of choice when they are identified.28\n",

Although the overall results indicated no preference for either treatment arm, in patients with risk factors (i.e., severe underlying lung disease, more than four exacerbations/year, duration of bronchitis > 10 years, elderly, or significant comorbid illness), the use of ciprofloxacin led to improved clinical outcome, higher quality of life, and lower costs.

Smoking and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections are major risk factors for chronic bronchitis. Therefore, smoking cessation and vaccination strategies are cornerstones of management in terms of halting disease progression and reducing the frequency of infectious exacerbations. Bacterial infection is the main culprit in acute flares of the disease. Routine antimicrobial therapy fails in a significant number of patients, and therapeutic failures lead to increased costs. Several stratification schemes have been proposed to improve initial antimicrobial selection. These schemes identify patient's age, severity of underlying pulmonary dysfunction, frequency of exacerbations, and the presence of comorbid illnesses as predictors for likely pathogens and to guide antimicrobial selection. This approach may reduce the risk for treatment failure, which would have significant medical and economic implications. Improved understanding of the roles of airway inflammation and infection in the pathogenesis of progressive airway disease, in addition to future studies examining the efficacy of newer classes of antimicrobials, should guide physicians to target early and effective treatment to high-risk patients.",
