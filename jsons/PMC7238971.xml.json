Systemic fibrinolysis consisted of 100 mg Alteplase (Boehringer Ingelheim, France) intravenously. The conditions of 2 patients (#3-1 and #5) with obstructive shock improved, with a decreased norepinephrine dose shortly after fibrinolysis. However, another rescue therapy for the second hit did not succeed (#3-2), leading to multi-organ failure despite veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) support. Fibrinolysis in patient #4 did not resolve shock, requiring V-A ECMO. Circumstances of CA were typical: during prone to supine position mobilization (#2) or after tracheal intubation (#1). Chest compressions were performed during 1 hour after therapy, without return of spontaneous circulation. Among survivors, thrombolytic therapy was complicated with major hemorrhage requiring transfusion.",

Since high incidence of thromboembolic events (25-40%) was reported in SARS-CoV-2 patients1, the majority of our ICU patients was treated with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant agents. Whereas systemic fibrinolysis is the treatment of choice in PE-related shock or CA in the absence of contraindication2, how could this poor outcome be explained? First, PE may be oversuspected, because ACP does not systematically mean PE diagnosis. Indeed, ACP can be described in as many as 22% cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to lung vascular dysfunction driven by inflammation, thrombosis, fluid overload and two hits (pneumonia and mechanical ventilation)3. Risk factors of ACP are pneumonia as cause of ARDS, severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, elevated driving pressure, all these elements being encountered in the most severe COVID-19 patients. Second, poor prognosis could be the consequence of deleterious association of 2 severe conditions, namely, ARDS and PE-related shock or CA. At least, COVID-19 pneumonia is to date a dreadful disease, with around 50% mortality in ICU4.",

To our sense, lower limbs ultrasound should systematically complete echocardiography to search for venous thrombosis, providing further clues for PE diagnosis in case of shock/CA5. Further studies are required to appreciate the place of systemic fibrinolysis during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",
