Of the 14 pediatric patients who received TCD allografts for nonmalignant indications, eight experienced graft failure. An increased risk of graft failure is well recognized with TCD and is in part attributable to a reduction in the number of pluripotent hematopoietic stem in the graft.13 However, in 1998 O'Donnell et al15 reported that this complication had been largely overcome by augmentation of the allograft with CD34+ stem cells. Of the 110 adult patients treated in his study with matched sibling transplants and graft manipulation identical to that described here, only five patients, (4.5%) experienced graft failure. In four of the five patients, the graft failure was explainable by a known risk factor, including aplastic anemia, extensive pretransplant platelet transfusions, or prior sensitization to donor histocompatability antigens.

GVHD therefore remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in unrelated transplants. At this institution, the use of simple TCD decreased the incidence of clinically significant GVHD to below 25%.9 However, simple TCD was associated with a higher incidence (10%) of graft failure and thus did not lead to an overall improvement in survival.32 The concomitant use of CD34+ augmentation with elutriation has allowed us to achieve fast and durable engraftment while maintaining low rates of severe GVHD. In a simultaneous study of adults undergoing matched sibling transplants, O'Donnell et al reported a rate of clinically significant GVHD of only 11%.15 These results are consistent with the rate of 19% observed here in pediatric patients undergoing related and unrelated transplant.

Possible explanations for this finding include more intact immunity compared to heavily pretreated leukemia patients and alloimmunization from multiple red blood cell transfusions. For children with nonmalignant diseases, it will be necessary to reduce the risk of graft rejection by increasing immune ablation by the preparative regimen and/or by improving posttransplant immune suppression.
