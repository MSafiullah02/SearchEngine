Particularly, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8) was reduced by 1:1 and 1:2 DHA/AA ratios; on the contrary, it was further increased by 1:4 and 1:7 DHA/AA ratios if compared to LPS challenge alone (Fig. 5). Moreover, the 1:1 and 1:2 DHA/AA ratios were effective in increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 release and in modifying the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 6). This finding confirmed previous studies showing that IL-10 protects against the lethal effects of LPS by significantly reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes and murine peritoneal macrophages. These data suggested that inflammatory cytokine release was dependent on the proportion of n-3 in the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio of alveolar cell membranes, being reduced with the supply of DHA and increased with a high proportion of AA. According to several other data, shifting the PUFA supply from n-6 to n-3 with a ratio of 1:2 may be a good means to dampen pro-inflammatory responses in ALI.",

Similarly, an RCT in ALI/ ARDS mechanically ventilated patients showed that an n-3 PUFA-enriched enteral diet may be more beneficial for gas exchange, respiratory dynamics, and length of mechanical ventilation if compared with a control formula, but no difference both in ICU or hospital LOS and mortality was found between the two formulas (Singer et al. 2006).

The first RCT analyzed the effect of an enteral n-3 PUFA-enriched diet in septic patients with ALI or ARDS showing that the administration of the study formula, compared to a control formula with less lipids than in the previous three studies, was associated to a shorter ICU-LOS but not to an improvement in gas exchange or in a lower incidence of novel organ failures (Grau-Carmona et al. 2011). A phase 2 placebo-controlled RCT in ALI patients investigating an enteral administration of fish oil for up to 14 days did not demonstrate a decrease in cytokine or other inflammatory marker concentrations both in BAL fluid from baseline to day 4 or 8 and in plasma, as well as a decrease in ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, organ failure score, or 60-day mortality (Stapleton et al. 2011). The last RCT tested the effects of enteral feeding with n-3 PUFAs, \u03b3-linolenic acid, and antioxidants on clinical outcomes in ALI patients in a phase 3 trial (OMEGA trial) using a twice-daily bolus administration (Rice et al. 2011). Contrary to all other RCTs, the authors reported that enteral administration of this formula was associated to significantly fewer ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and non-pulmonary organ failure-free days, as well as more days with diarrhea. The trial was stopped early for futility at the first interim analysis. The interpretation of the OMEGA trial presents some difficulties (Lev and Singer 2013). Firstly, it was used a different approach of twice-daily bolus administration of enteral formulas instead of continuous enteral infusion. Secondly, the enteral diets administered to the study group (i.e., megadoses of n-3 PUFAs and lower protein content) and to the control group (i.e., higher protein and carbohydrate content) are notably different from those used in the first three RCTs.",

The rationale for their use in ALI/ARDS patients is consistent and based on several issues. Firstly, a large amount of experimental studies in lung models supports the anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 PUFAs. Secondly, patients at risk for ARDS and with established ARDS have plasma EPA concentrations about 25 % and 7 %, respectively, as compared with normal, hypothesizing a potential benefit for n-3 PUFA administration in those patients. Finally, in three level I studies involving patients with ALI, ARDS, and sepsis, the use of an enteral diet enriched with n-3 PUFAs (in the form of EPA), \u03b3-linolenic acid, and antioxidants was shown to significantly reduce ICU-LOS, mechanical ventilation length, organ failure incidence, and mortality if compared to the use of a standard enteral formula.",

There have been a number of clinical trials evaluating the effects of administration of n-3 PUFAs in those diseases with contradicting results. For example, there is some pretty good evidence of the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in rheumatoid arthritis.
