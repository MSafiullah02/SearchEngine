            "text": "Ever since the introduction of the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) in Mainland China, Hong Kong has been benefited from the increasing number of IVS travelers. The IVS, which was introduced in July 2003 immediately after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and with the central government's support of the economy in Hong Kong, allows travelers from selected cities in Mainland China to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis. However, IVS travelers can only stay in Hong Kong for not more than 7 days on each visit (China Legislative Information Network System, 2003). In May 2006, the extension of the scheme has brought the number of IVS cities in Mainland China to 44 (Lu, 2006). Such a policy considerably simplifies the process for Chinese travelers to visit Hong Kong. This, in turn, leads to the large increase in the number of IVS travelers. As reported by Tourism Commission\u2014Economic Development and Labor Bureau\u2014The Government of the HKSAR, 2004, Tourism Commission\u2014Economic Development and Labor Bureau\u2014The Government of the HKSAR, 2007, as of March 2004, the number of IVS travelers who visited Hong Kong was 1.47 million, and as of December 2006 the number has increased more than 10-folds to 17.2 million. The arrivals of IVS travelers, together with the regular packaged travelers, have largely contributed to the rapid recovery of the local economy in Hong Kong. The expenses that these Chinese travelers have spent permeate to different business sectors, and specifically the foodservice sector, as dining is always one of the most popular activities for Chinese travelers (Cai et al., 2001; HKTB, 2005; Li and Carr, 2004; Wang and Qu, 2004). In Hong Kong, over 9000 restaurants offer a great variety of cuisine such as Dim Sum and food originating from different regions of China, as well as other eastern and western gastronomic delights at world-class standard. Au and Law (2002) stated that Hong Kong has more restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the world, and that dining in the city would be an unforgettable experience for all visitors.",

In the context of travelers from Mainland China, food is considered as far more important than anything else (Dunlop, 2005), and that the attributes of food and beverage include quality, portion size, presentation, taste, and variety of choices. In spite of the growing number of the outbound travelers from China, and the significant contribution of their arrivals to the tourism industry in general and the foodservice sector in particular, the existing hospitality and tourism literature virtually has no published article on IVS Chinese travelers\u2019 behavior in selecting restaurants. To fill this void, this research makes an initial attempt to investigate the perceived importance of attributes pertaining to the selection of restaurants from the perspective of IVS and packaged Chinese travelers. Min (2004) stated the importance of performing studies on expectations and perceptions of Chinese travelers. More importantly, this research aims to find out whether IVS travelers and packaged travelers choose their restaurants differently during their trips, and therefore whether foodservice managers should act or react to these two groups of travelers\u2019 behaviors differently. Research findings can contribute to better understand the consumer behaviors of Chinese travelers.",

Johns and Pine (2002) as well as Koo et al., (1999) stated that consumers assess a complex set of attributes during their selection of restaurants. Johns and Pine (2002), for instance, advocated that restaurants could increase their attractiveness by offering lower price and better food quality. In other words, price and quality can be the contributing factors to the business success of a restaurant. Pedraja and Yague (2002) claimed that when consumers search for restaurants, both active and passive external information search are involved. Active external search is affected by demographic background such as family income, whereas passive external search is affected by their level of prior knowledge, use of price-quality criteria, and level of perceived risks. Customers would search for information and then compare the options before making a decision for a restaurant choice.",

Hence, the necessity of understanding the decision-making process of consumers is important to restaurateurs (June and Smith, 1987). Koo et al.

Findings in more recent studies are more specific. In particular, several studies concurred with the foremost importance of food and beverage quality during the restaurants selection process (Auty, 1992; Lewis, 1981; Lo and Lam, 2004; Sulek and Hensley, 2004).

As far as price is concerned, pricing strategy has always been a signal of product quality (Brooker et al., 1986).

According to Auty (1992) and Kivela (1997), this factor includes brand image, new experience, word-of-mouth, and advertising. Similarly, Hong and Woo's (2004) study found brand image could affect the performance of a hospitality business. Meanwhile, some studies (Bowie and Chang, 2005; Lin and Mattila, 2006; Yau and Lee, 1996) argued that restaurants should provide new experiences to customers by introducing special dishes in order to retain their attractiveness. The effectiveness of promotion through word-of-mouth as a third-party evaluation of products or services has been examined by Walker (1995). Hsu et al. (2006) as well as Heung (2002) even found word-of-mouth particularly effective and efficient for Chinese because through word-of-mouth, the message is forwarded convincingly. Also, Chen (1995) found Chinese perceived advertising positively, and hence the impact of advertisements on Chinese travelers would be high. Ferle and Lee (2002) advocated that as Hong Kong is targeting at the Mainland China market, it is necessary to understand how Chinese consumers view advertisements in the foodservice industry.",

The second part of the questionnaire comprised 18 attributes (variables) which were adapted from Auty (1992) and Heung (2002) and fell into five dimensions of food and beverage, service, price, environment, and attraction. As pointed out in Section 2, these dimensions were identified as the most essential factors on restaurants selection. A seven-point Likert scale was used for each of these attributes which ranged from 7 (strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree), and respondents were requested to rate the importance for each of these attributes.",

Lew and McKercher (2002) further showed the appropriateness of using these variables in tourism research. There was also an open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire to allow the respondents to provide additional comments that are related to the five dimensions. The original questionnaire was developed in English, which was then translated to Chinese, and finally to English using a blind-translation\u2013back-translation technique (Hsu et al., 2006). Such a method ensures the accuracy of a translation. Using a convenience sampling technique, the Chinese questionnaire was pilot-tested by 30 Chinese travelers (including 17 IVS and 13 packaged travelers) in early 2005 at the Avenue of Stars\u2014one of Hong Kong's most popular tourist spots. To ensure the content validity of the questionnaire, the travelers were requested to evaluate the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of all statements. No problem was found in the pilot test, and the large-scale survey was conducted in mid-2005 for 2 months at the Avenue of Stars due to its easy accessibility and the mass gathering of Chinese travelers. During that time, two interviewers were recruited to approach Chinese travelers for completing questionnaires during day time on weekdays. Among 239 completed questionnaires received, nine were discarded due to the numerous missing values, leaving 230 usable questionnaires for analysis.",

A chi-square test indicated a significant difference between the ages of IVS and packaged travelers. Apparently, IVS travelers were younger than their packaged counterparts. This difference is probably due to the fact that young travelers like to freely plan for their own trips instead of to join well-planned excursions lead by tour guides. Excursions, however, provided more confidence and assurance, which are normally welcomed by more mature travelers. Dotson and Clark (2004) pointed out that the risk in decision-making for packaged tourists is always lower than individual travelers. In addition, packaged tourists had a lower demand for special or new experiences which differ from others. In contrast, young tourists might not like to be restricted by routine schedules.",

The percentage distributions of IVS and packaged travelers who had completed secondary school or bachelor degree were about the same, but there was a disproportionate discrepancy in the number of travelers with post-graduate degrees between these two groups. Apparently, IVS travelers were better educated than packaged travelers. Similarly, the percentages of IVS travelers and packaged travelers with a family income of RMB 1001\u20134000 (US $1=RMB 7.8) were comparable but relatively there were significantly more IVS travelers with a family income of higher than RMB 4000. Such an observation implies that IVS travelers were from wealthier families. Since education level and income are positively correlated, the better-educated IVS travelers were more likely to spend more during their travel. Since packaged tours are generally of a lower quality in products and service (Dotson and Clark, 2004), they are less attractive to highly educated travelers. Despite the lower price, the packaged tours do not appear to be as appealing to the financially stronger travelers such as the IVS travelers.",

Generally speaking, packaged travelers spent less on dining than their IVS counterparts as meals were often included in the package. Another reason for packaged tourists to spend less on food was probably due to their lower family income.

This result is not unexpected, as Hong Kong had been a British colony for 150 years prior to 1997, and the city was largely influenced by Western culture. Such an influence directly applies to the service industry, which does not seem to have enough knowledge on the sub-cultural differences when serving the Chinese market. Koo et al. (1999) claimed local service providers had admitted that they were unable to understand the needs of Chinese travelers and it was not easy to gratify these travelers.

These significant differences could probably be related to the higher expectation for quality and presentation as a result of higher family income of IVS travelers. Such findings are in accordance with Kivela's (1997) study which stated that higher income groups usually have a higher expectation on food product than low income groups. Packaged tourists normally visit Hong Kong for shopping and sightseeing, and meals were always included as part of the package.

Drawing on the findings of this study and knowing the expectation of Chinese travelers (i.e. the answers to the research question), managers probably do not need to spend too much effort on segmenting IVS travelers and packaged travelers. Instead, they should make an ongoing attempt to improve the factors that were perceived as important by travelers. As an example, since word-of-mouth was found to be more important than advertising in attracting patrons, restaurateurs could probably give simple keepsakes with contact details and discount coupons to remind the tourists of their experience in the restaurant. These keepsakes are likely to be brought back to travelers\u2019 home towns and the effect of such attraction would then be more noteworthy. Also, appropriate training should be provided to staff on quality of service and communication skills.
