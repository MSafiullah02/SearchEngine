Part II included 18 questions measuring the extent of occupational exposure to infectious risks, job training and education, the use of PPE, and their concerns and suggestions. Detailed follow-up questions were used in several categories. Specific occupational exposure information included exposure experiences, types of occupational exposure, types of infectious diseases to which they were exposed, and previous reports of occupational exposure (if occupational exposure was not reported, the reasons for this were also collected). Specific PPE use information included use of PPE as a standard precaution (ie, wearing gloves and other PPE), manipulation of needles, use of sharps containers, types of PPE used during the transfer of patients with respiratory symptoms, and types of PPE used during transfer of patients with bleeding. Specific information about job training and educational experiences within the past year was collected, including the status of their training in occupational exposure to infection risks, use of PPE, and postexposure management (PEM). Information about participants' major concerns and suggestions about occupational exposure and prevention was also collected. The questionnaire was revised to increase validity following a pilot study of expert EMPs. The final questionnaire included 30 questions.",

Unlike the previous studies,1, 6 our study revealed that EMP percutaneous exposure in Korea (ie, needlestick injury) was the most frequent route of occupational exposure to body fluids and blood. This result was likely related to the high rate of recapping and manipulation of needles, and to participants' dissatisfaction with their use of puncture-resistant containers for disposal of needles and sharps (shown in Table 1). Therefore, job training and education about blood and body fluid exposure prevention should be encouraged. In addition, supplies of sharps containers should be increased in all areas of the work environment.",
