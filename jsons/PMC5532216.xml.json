NS3 helicase/NTPase activities are modulated by the NS3 protease domain and NS5B8, with CSFV NS3 interacting with NS5B to enhance RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, which can occur through NS3 binding to the two terminal sequences of NS5B through an NS3-protease domain9, 10. Additionally, NS3 is an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-binding protein that increases IRES-dependent translation; however, CSFV NS5A and NS5B can reduce NS3-IRES interactions by competitively binding to the same sites in IRES-containing RNA sequences. The inhibitory effect of NS5B on NS3-IRES binding results from NS3-NS5B interactions11. Additionally, NS3 accumulation is related to the cytopathic effect (CPE) of CSFV12.",

TRAF6 contains N-terminal Really Interesting New Gene (RING) and zinc-finger domains that enable its functioning as an ubiquitin E3 ligase essential for activation of downstream signalling cascades. TRAF6 also contains a coil-coil TRAF-N domain and a highly conserved TRAF-C domain, which contribute to their homo- and hetero-oligomerization and interactions with receptors and intracellular signalling proteins13, 14. Furthermore, TRAF6 is a critically important adaptor protein involved in the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB)-signalling pathway. When ligand or stimulator, such as poly (I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is added, TLR recruits adaptor proteins, including MyD88, TLR/IL-1R-domain containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta, and TRAF6. Moreover, lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains are catalytically synthesized by ubiquitin ligase in the TRAF6 RING domain. K63-polyubiquitination targets TRAF6, and ubiquitinated TRAF6 initiates signalling cascades15, 16 that ultimately promote the rapid translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus, followed by phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 and transcriptional activation of various target genes, such as type 1 interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines17\u201319. Previous studies showed that CSFV fails to activate the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway and decreases IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 levels20\u201322. In HCV, depletion of TRAF6 by HCV suppresses activation of NF-\u03baB and induction of proinflammatory cytokines and enhances HCV replication23. We hypothesized that TRAF6 might affect CSFV replication by regulating the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway.",

The identified proteins were predicted as being involved in DNA binding, RNA binding, metabolism, signalling pathways, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and cancer-related pathways. Previously, our group focused on the TLR-mediated host innate immune response upon CSFV infection. CSFV Shimen infection results in a significant induction of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR7, but decreased of TLR3. Importantly, TLR3-mediated innate responses induced by poly(I:C) are inhibited in the Shimen infected porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (pMDMs). We also revealed that CSFV Shimen infection of pMDMs leads to the activation of MAPK signalling pathways, while it fails to activate NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, the Shimen infection reduces interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 expression, but enhances IRF7 expression, thereby affecting the production of type I IFN responses21. HCV infection suppresses host innate immune response by degrading TRAF623. Among the identified proteins, we chose TRAF6 for further study due to its involvement in the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway and innate immune response. First, we verified interactions between TRAF6 and NS3 by the Y2H system. The yeast strain Y2HGold was co-transformed with the prey plasmid AD-TRAF6 and the bait plasmid BD-NS3 or BD. Co-transformations with BD-p53/AD-T, BD-Lam/AD-T, and BD/AD as positive, negative and blank controls, respectively, indicated that the experiments were successful (Fig. 1a).\n\n",

Here, inducing expression of GST-NS3 occurs following the addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubation for 6 h at 20 \u00b0C. Expressed GST-NS3 proteins were added to a Pierce spin column and were immobilized with glutathione agarose for 2 h, followed by addition of cell lysates containing TRAF6-Flag. Eluted proteins were analysed by Western blot using anti-Flag antibodies. We observed that TRAF6 was captured by NS3-GST rather than by GST alone (Fig. 1d). To confirm the interaction between NS3 and TRAF6, GST-TRAF6 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells and the NS3-GFP protein expressed in HEK293T cells were subjected to the GST pull-down assay, with results showing that GST-TRAF6, not GST, interacted with NS3-GFP (Fig. 1e). These findings demonstrated that NS3 interacted with TRAF6 in vitro.",

The relative levels of TRAF6 protein were estimated by histograms representing density readings of the gel bands, and ratios were calculated relative to \u03b2-actin control (Fig. 3a\u2013c). To determine whether TRAF6 expression levels are regulated by CSFV infection, mock- and CSFV-infected PAMs were harvested at the selected times to detect TRAF6 expression. We observed no obvious changes in TRAF6 mRNA levels following CSFV infection (Fig. 3d); however, TRAF6 protein levels were significantly lower in CSFV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 3e and f). These findings revealed that CSFV or NS3 altered cellular TRAF6 protein levels without affecting mRNA expression, indicating a role in TRAF6 degradation.

CSFV Erns suppresses the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and cell apoptosis25, and CSFV Npro limits type I IFN induction through proteasomal degradation of IRF3 and interaction with IRF726, 27. CSFV NS3 is a multifunctional, non-structural protein that plays a major role in CSFV replication3, 4, 7. In HCV, NS3 modulates cell signalling and host-cell responses through its interaction with various cellular proteins, including binding to host apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3G protein to inhibit HCV replication28, 29. However, whether CSFV NS3 attenuates the immune response remains unclear. Additionally, no studies are investigating host-cell protein interactions with CSFV NS3. Here we verified 26 host-cell proteins as interacting with CSFV NS3 according to yeast two-hybrid results, with the identified proteins predicted to be involved in metabolism, endocytosis, apoptosis, heat-shock response, and immune response according to bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, TRAF6 was verified as interacting with CSFV NS3 by co-IP and GST pull-down assays. These results provide the empirical foundation for further research on the function of CSFV NS3, and it is the first report that TRAF6 interacts with CSFV NS3. Moreover, we showed that TRAF6 inhibited CSFV replication and that both CSFV and NS3 alone were capable of degrading TRAF6 in PAMs. Additionally, CSFV NS3 is dose-dependent for degradation of TRAF6. However, reduced TRAF6 levels resulted in downregulation of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression, which contributed to CSFV persistent replication. These results offered insight into the mechanisms related to CSFV evasion of host antiviral responses via TRAF6 degradation by CSFV NS3.",

It was previously shown that downregulation of TRAF6 decreases cell viability, suppresses cell proliferation, and promotes cell apoptosis in lung cancer cells32. Furthermore, TRAF6 mediates TLR-signalling pathways and NF-\u03baB activation to modulate the expression of antiviral cytokines33, 34. Recent studies demonstrated that TRAF6 expression is reduced in chronic HCV patients, and TRAF6 knockdown results in increased HCV RNA levels in myeloid dendritic cells35, 36. In this study, cellular protein TRAF6 interacted with the CSFV NS3 and inhibited CSFV replication. Considering this with the results, the participation of TRAF6 in CSFV life cycle indicates that this protein plays a potential role in host immune defence and anti-CSFV strategies.",

TRAF6 downregulation of decreases levels of p-p65 in the lung cancer cell line A549. TRAF6 overexpression is associated with lung cancer tumourigenesis and invasion32. Additionally, TRAF6 is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway37. NF-\u03baB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a central role in immunity. Viruses elicit the expression and release of a range of cytokines via the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway as part of the primary host defense mechanism. A previous study reported that CSFV failed to activate the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway20, 21. Our findings showed that TRAF6 overexpression promoted NF-\u03baB activation, and resulted in upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression in PAMs. Moreover, TRAF6 knockdown decreased NF-\u03baB activation induced by poly (I:C) and downregulated IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression. IFN-\u03b2, an antiviral cytokine, and IL-6, involved in immune responses, might contribute to the suppression of CSFV replication. The results implied that TRAF6 degradation might play a major role in inhibiting NF-\u03baB-mediated signalling during CSFV infection. These findings agreed with observations that some RNA viruses, such as Sendai virus or vesicular stomatitis virus could induce proteasome-dependent or -independent TRAF6 degradation to impair NF-\u03baB activation and production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines38.",

Furthermore, we revealed that TRAF6 was unable to inhibit CSFV replication and increase IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression following inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. These findings suggested a possible mechanism involving TRAF6 activation of NF-\u03baB signalling to increase production of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 for inhibiting CSFV replication. It has reported that HCV suppresses host innate immune response via induction of autophagic degradation of TRAF623.

The beads were washed five times with 1:1 wash solution (TBS: Pull-Down Lysis Buffer). Then, HEK293T cell lysates containing TRAF6-Flag were added and were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Protein samples were washed five times followed by elution with Glutathione Elution Buffer. Western blot detected the eluted proteins. GST-TRAF6 expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta and NS3-GFP expressed in HEK293T cells were also used to further verify the interaction between NS3 and TRAF6 in the GST pull-down assay.",

At 16 h post-transfection (hpt), the medium was replaced with advanced DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 0.01 mM L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine, 0.01 mM cholesterol (Sigma, USA), 4.0 mM L-glutamine and 1:1000 diluted chemically defined lipid (Invitrogen, USA). After 48 h of incubation, the culture supernatant was centrifuged and was collected as the lentivirus. Lentiviral titres were determined by tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in HEK293T cells. PAMs in 6-well plates were transduced with the lentiviruses at 10 transduction units per cell, and polybrene was added to enhance infection rate. After 8\u201310 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and incubation for an additional 48 h. Positive cells were selected with puromycin (Thermo, USA) at 6 \u03bcg/ml final concentration to generate the stable cell lines for TRAF6 overexpression (CMV-TRAF6 cells) or knockdown (TRAF6-sh2 cells).
