            "text": "This Supplement on the management of mass critical care for ill patients represents the consensus opinion of a multidisciplinary panel convened under the umbrella of the Critical Care Collaborative Initiative. Expert recommendations on this subject are needed. Most countries have insufficient critical care staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care to a surge of critically ill victims. If a mass casualty critical care event were to occur tomorrow, many people with clinical conditions that are survivable under usual health-care system conditions may have to forgo life-sustaining interventions owing to deficiencies in supply or staffing. As a result, US and Canadian authorities1\n2 have called for the development of comprehensive plans for managing mass casualty events, particularly for the provision of critical care. This Supplement includes the following: (1) a review of current US and Canadian baseline critical care preparedness and response capabilities and limitations, (2) a suggested framework for critical care surge capacity, (3) suggestions for minimum resources ICUs will need for mass critical care, and (4) a suggested framework for allocation of scarce critical care resources when critical care surge capacity remains insufficient to meet need. This Supplement is intended to aid clinicians and disaster planners in providing a coordinated and uniform response to mass critical care.",

Attention to mass critical care, however, has been stimulated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002\u20132003,4\n5 recent natural disasters, concern for intentional catastrophes, and the looming threat of a serious influenza pandemic.1\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11 To guide preparedness for such events, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care (hereafter referred to as the Task Force) was convened. It comprised 37 experts from fields including bioethics, critical care, disaster preparedness and response, emergency medical services, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, hospital medicine, law, military medicine, nursing, pharmacy, respiratory care, and local, state, and federal government planning and response. Several members of the Critical Care Collaborative (http://www.chestnet.org/institutes/cci/ccc.php) initiated the project and assembled a steering committee for project development and administration. Members of this steering committee included representatives from the organizational members of the Critical Care Collaborative as well as several unaffiliated North American disaster experts. This steering committee then selected members of the broader Task Force on the basis of their expertise and experience.",

Modern health-care experience caring for hundreds or thousands of critically ill and injured victims from civilian catastrophes is limited.6\n7\n12 There are few randomized, controlled trials involving the subject matter of this Supplement, so this document is a consensus statement derived from senior-level, experienced, expert opinion rather than an evidence-based guideline. Given the paucity of direct evidence to guide mass casualty critical care practice, all of the suggestions of the Task Force are, at best, extrapolated from rigorous evaluations of everyday ICU care, as well as the related fields of military medicine and critical care transport. Lack of direct evidence does not negate their anticipated beneficial effect for mass casualty critical care situations.13 Consensus of suggestions was achieved by electronic communication with Task Force members. No disagreements were received on any of the final suggestions. The American College of Chest Physicians Health and Science Policy Committee designates that these suggestions should not be used for performance measurement or for competency purposes because they are not evidence-based. Because the term suggestion implies an option to choose among a number of possibilities, the writing committee wishes to emphasize that these suggestions should in fact be considered coordinated proposals to establish a sound foundation for ICU disaster plans.",

In such cases, it is necessary to target the resources available to those who are most likely to benefit in order to maximize overall survival. This is accomplished through triage, a complex process balancing available resources with the demands on those resources at a population level rather than at the individual patient level, where health-care workers typically focus. In short, the goal is to do the greatest good for the greatest number. In some situations, optimal triage will have enormous impact on overall mortality. Obviously, such decisions are very complex, fraught with ethical dilemmas that require thoughtful consideration well in advance of their use in an emergency. Failure to perform optimal triage carries with it significant consequences because either overtriage or undertriage will likely increase mortality for the entire critically ill and injured population.",

Both EMCC and critical care triage represent a deviation from providing usual, current state-of-the-art critical care and depriving some individuals the optimum treatment for the good of the collective society. Thus, such actions are justifiable only in very specific circumstances and must occur within a response framework as outlined in Figures 1\n2\n. These figures illustrate how the various concepts in this Supplement are integrated within a comprehensive response framework. Hospitals should ensure that their critical care staff understand and are able to use the tools of EMCC and triage within an integrated response should they ever be called on to respond to an overwhelming number of critically ill or injured victims. This Supplement therefore serves as a necessary beginning in this planning process. It is expected that as hospitals practice, drill, and achieve surge capacity, these suggestions will require modification.",

The figure provides an integrated overview of the reactive response to an event producing critically ill or injured individuals. A reactive response is required when there is little or no pre-event warning, thus limiting the ability of the system for augmentation prior to the surge. Working from left to right in the diagram. Trigger thresholds: these represent points when criteria are met for activation of various tools such as mass critical care (MCC) and triage. Tiers: this graphic component of the diagram describes the tiers of the response. Based on the magnitude of the event, higher tiers will be activated. Graphical figures illustrate hospitals, jurisdictions (ie, a city), states, and a nation. The circle and slash denotes that the associated resource is overwhelmed. From bottom up: Row 1: Individual facility response occurs either early in an event as the first receiving hospitals are impacted or in events with smaller magnitudes. Row 2: Health-care coalition response occurs when several local area hospitals are overwhelmed. Row 3: Local jurisdictional response occurs when the resources of an entire jurisdiction are drawn on due to direct impact or via mutual aid responses. Row 4: State responses are activated to support events occurring in multiple jurisdictions or if the entire state is impacted. Row 5: Interstate regional responses draw on the resources of neighboring states as entire states are overwhelmed. Row 6: Federal responses are required for large events usually involving a wide geographic area. Response: At tier 1 usual surge strategies are employed including activation of mutual aid agreements with neighboring hospitals. At tiers 2 to 4, as it is recognized that multiple hospitals or jurisdictions are overwhelmed and due to the sudden nature of the event there is insufficient time to decant patients or effectively augment the response in a timely manner, reactive mass critical care strategies may be employed temporarily until either of these are accomplished or 24 h has elapsed, at which time permission may be obtained from the appropriate authorities to continue mass critical care. Should a sudden event overwhelm resources to the tier 5 or tier 6 level, mass critical care will likely be required. Resource allocation strategies will be employed as part of mass critical care strategies in tiers 1 to 5, but critical care triage protocols should only be employed if resources are overwhelmed beyond the tier 5 level. Casualties: This is an illustrative graphic of critically ill casualties generated by an event. The impact of an event is not solely dependant on the absolute number of casualties but also the specific medical needs of the casualties and the available resources.",
