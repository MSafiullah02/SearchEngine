            "text": "Editor -We read with interest the article by D'Silva and colleagues in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. 1 They describe an extubation technique for patients with COVID-19 using two airway filters, with one attached to the tracheal tube and another attached to the facemask. We agree with the concept of using two airway filters for tracheal extubation and believe it is currently one of the safest ways currently described in the literature. However, we propose three modifications that we use at our institution when extubating patients with COVID-19 that improve upon D'Silva and colleagues' technique. Prior to extubation we recommend disconnecting the gas sampling line and moving it to the new filter attached to the facemask. This will allow for detection of end-tidal CO 2 immediately following extubation. As the gas sampling line port is downstream from the filter, the port can either be left open or sealed with the plug that either comes attached with the existing filter or with the plug from the new filter. Second, instead of stacking the airway filters on top of each other we recommend discarding both the tracheal tube and its filter upon extubation. This results in the standard facemask, filter and circuit setup that we find to be both less awkward and less likely to disconnect inadvertently compared to the double airway filter setup proposed by D'Silva and colleagues. Furthermore, using one filter will reduce the overall dead space of the circuit, which could be an important factor in paediatric cases. Finally, we recommend using a surgical mask with elastic ear loops attached to the patients ears and under their chin prior to removal of the facemask so that it can be quickly positioned into place following facemask removal. Oxygen can then be applied either with nasal prongs as D'Silva and colleagues describe or with a simple oxygen facemask on top of the surgical mask. We thank D'Silva and colleagues for their article, and hope that our suggestions further improve upon the safety of their extubation technique for COVID-19 patients.",
