Diagnostics are frequently challenged by circulating influenza strains and debates over the ideal test(s) for suspected influenza cases are long standing [2,3]. Balancing needs for rapid, sensitive, cost-effective testing is difficult. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is acknowledged as gold-standard testing for influenza because many enzyme immune-assays (EIA) lack sensitivity [2]. However, RT-PCR assays are not widely used among Emergency Departments (ED) and ancillary clinics. Recent surveys of 240 US hospitals revealed that 67% rely solely on EIA testing and that fewer than 26% of US hospitals surveyed reported the availability of molecular assays as options within hospitals [4,5].",

Management of suspected influenza patients were examined over four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral/antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies (Fig. 3\n). Costs associated with laboratory studies, anti-infective therapies, and medical procedures where taken directly from hospital billing. Costs associated with the admission from the ED to the hospital, for diagnosis of pneumonia and respiratory infection (without complexity coding), were taken from pre-established benchmark standards determined by the National Inpatient Sample databases including the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [[13], [14]]. Statistical analysis was performed using binomial one sample test where the null hypothesis was Proportion = 0",

In consultation with ED staff, we defined a turn-around time for Liat\u00ae testing at <30 min. Among the total 292 cases tested, 91.7%, (268/292) received an influenza result in the ED within \u226430 min from the order entry.

Among cases for which a < 30 min turn-around time could not be achieved the average turn-around time was 46-min (range 36\u2013120-min). However, among these 24 cases, 45.8% (11/24) involved patient encounters in the ED stabilization room which require higher levels of care within the ED. These patients often have longer, more complicated ED management, thus it is understandable why many of the patients seen in ED stabilization rooms would experience delays in laboratory testing because testing becomes less of a priority compared to the resuscitation of the patient that occurs in ED stabilization rooms. Additional factors contributing to turn-around times >30 min could not be determined for the remaining 13 cases.",

Rogers and colleagues recently compared rapid multiplex PCR testing to traditional batch PCR testing among pediatric ED patients, further demonstrating the associations between rapid diagnosis antibiotic stewardship, reduced length of stay, and decreased time to diagnosis [8]. However, despite statistical significance with respect to time to diagnosis, testing was unavailable for 48% of pediatric ED patients in time to influence ED admission [8]. While such studies define the clinical value of rapid RT-PCR-based influenza however, they fall short of establishing clinical utility of ED testing because testing occurs in centralized laboratory locations after the ED visit.

This finding is in contrast to previous studies that concluded rapid testing can control ancillary testing [[26], [8], [27]]. These differences can be explained, in part, because we examined a wider range of laboratory and medical procedures compared to other studies. Additionally, studies demonstrating reductions in test ordering frequently focus only on positive influenza results. Given this bias, it is highly likely that the vast majority of influenza testing, which is often negative, results in greater utilization of laboratory testing because testing expands to support narrowing differential diagnoses.",

            "text": "We conclude that our findings are an underestimation of the overall clinical impact of influenza testing observed in our study because of our study design. Many influenza series rely on pre-and post-testing cohorts which are subject to differences in patient acuity, seasonal influenza strains, and differences among physician behavior which collectively influence data sets. Patients who are tested for influenza during flu season often present with additional co-morbidities. In such patients, management decisions and length of hospital stay are influenced by medical issues independent of influenza status which are not accounted for in the vast majority of pre-and post-intervention studies. In order to determine the impact of the influenza diagnosis on patient management we felt it was important to minimize confounding variables which independently affect physician management decisions. While this approach allowed us to further target the impact of influenza testing, it also excluded a number of patients for whom the influenza diagnosis is important. Additionally, 66% (n = 31) of the patients in whom a \u226430 min test result could not be achieved spent time in the ED stabilization room. The acuity of patients who require stabilization in the ED is high and while these patients undoubtedly have additional medical conditions other than respiratory infection they also benefit from rapid access to their influenza diagnosis. Thus, while we limited evaluation to patients in whom influenza testing could be stringently analyzed, we acknowledge that some patients for whom an influenza diagnosis would be helpful were excluded as part of our study design. Limiting patient enrollment to define respiratory infection allowed us to target the effect of the diagnosis, and while this study group demonstrated positive clinical and financial impacts of the rapid influenza diagnosis it is likely an underestimation of the value of providing rapid ED-based RT-PCR testing.",

However, recent experience with the Liat\u00ae assay using various ED and clinic locations indicates that testing can be reliably performed by non-laboratory staff such as nurses, physicians, or allied-health professionals [28]. It should be noted that during our study, testing occurred in the ED environment but was performed by laboratory staff. While we acknowledge the utility of testing using non-laboratory personnel in the ED, the primary aims of our study were to: [1] provide influenza testing within the ED; [2] to deliver a result within the time frame of typical ED visits; and [3] to further describe the impact of the diagnosis on patient management. Any utility gained by using non-laboratory personnel to perform testing requires first demonstrating that providing testing is of clinical benefit. The infrastructure needed to support point-of care testing is complex, requiring staffing support, laboratory oversight (where available), physician space, and education, which are often poorly defined in many studies and were not addressed in our study. Many of these variables were in place prior to our study, which did not impact our costs associated with testing, although we acknowledge that the costs associated with ED-based testing may be different for others. Our findings demonstrate that providing the RT-PCR testing in the ED during the patient visit is an actionable result that influenced and changed physician decision making in 61% of the cases and can be a cost-effective approach. These conclusions lend support for additional studies that can systematically describe the operational insights needed for point-of care testing.",
