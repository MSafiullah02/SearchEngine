The time-dependent reproduction number, R\nt, is an important parameter for assessing whether current control efforts are effective or whether additional interventions are required (Chowell and Nishiura, 2009). The value of R\nt represents the expected number of secondary cases arising from a primary case infected at time t. This value changes throughout an outbreak. If the value of R\nt is and remains below one, the outbreak will die out. However, while R\nt is larger than one, a sustained outbreak is likely. The aim of control interventions is typically to reduce the reproduction number below one (Camacho et al., 2015).",

Fraser (2007) distinguishes between the case reproduction number and the instantaneous reproduction number. The case reproduction number represents the average number of secondary cases arising from a primary case infected at time t; this parameter therefore reflects transmissibility after time t. In contrast, the instantaneous reproduction number represents the average number of secondary cases that would arise from a primary case infected at time t if conditions remained the same after time t. The latter therefore characterises the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d transmissibility at time t, and is more straightforward to estimate in real-time than the case reproduction number because it does not require assumptions about future transmissibility (Cori et al., 2013).",

This method has been applied to estimate reproduction numbers during epidemics of diseases including Ebola virus disease (Althaus, 2015; Kelly et al., 2018), Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Cauchemez et al., 2014) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (Arruda et al., 2017). It has also been extended to permit inference in different settings including in populations consisting of multiple host types (Glass et al., 2011), as well as to allow estimates to be informed by other types of data (Jombart et al., 2014; Campbell et al., 2019). Because of the importance of tracking temporal changes in epidemiological parameters, software implementing the framework of Wallinga and Teunis (2004) was developed to allow such analyses to be performed (Obadia et al., 2012). Other methods to estimate reproduction numbers at the start of an epidemic are also reviewed in Obadia et al. (2012) and implemented in the same R software package R0.",

First, an estimate of the serial interval distribution may not be available early in an outbreak, or may be associated with significant uncertainty. This is particularly the case for outbreaks of emerging infections, for which the natural history is not known or is poorly characterised (Metcalf and Lessler, 2017). Second, this approach assumes implicitly that all incident cases after the first time-point arise from local transmission, i.e. it does not account for the possibility that cases (other than those appearing at the first timestep) are imported from other locations or derive from alternative host species. However, epidemiological investigations throughout outbreaks often provide valuable data that can inform the serial interval distribution (Cowling et al., 2008, 2009; Forsberg White and Pagano, 2008; Forsberg White et al., 2009) and the sources of infection of cases (Paine et al., 2010; Cori et al., 2017).",

Our method also allows incorporation of available information on imported (as opposed to locally infected) cases. We use data from the outbreaks of H1N1 influenza in the USA in 2009 and Ebola virus disease in West Africa from 2013 to 2016 to show how directly including the latest serial interval observations can improve the precision and accuracy of estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number during an outbreak.

The dataset indicates which cases were in humans who have regular (potentially infective) contacts with animals, particularly camels. Since the dromedary camel is considered as a reservoir species of the MERS-coronavirus (Haagmans et al., 2014), we interpreted reported regular contact with animals as an indication of infection from the reservoir. This allowed us to distinguish between cases arising from human-human transmission, for example transmission in households or hospitals (Al-Tawfiq and Perl, 2015), and human cases derived directly from the animal reservoir.",

If control strategies were designed based on a pessimistic scenario corresponding to this upper bound, the R\nt estimates based on the early serial interval data could have led to designing unnecessarily intense interventions.

We compared estimates of the reproduction number obtained when using (results in red in Fig. 5b) and not using (results in black in Fig. 5b) this information. As expected, disregarding the information on the imported cases and instead assuming that those cases arose from local human-human transmission led to overestimation of the reproduction number. The blue shaded time-windows in Fig. 5b highlight times at which the mean reproduction number estimated assuming only local transmission is greater than one (so that the epidemic would not be estimated to be under control) when in fact the reproduction number estimated using information on imported cases is below one.

Our approach builds on a well-established method (Cori et al., 2013) and addresses two important limitations of the approach as proposed in that study. The first important feature of our framework is that data on pairs of infector/infected individuals can be included in the estimation procedure, so that the serial interval distribution and the time-dependent reproduction number can be estimated jointly from the latest available data. This leads to more precise estimates of transmissibility, as well as accurate quantification of the uncertainty associated with these estimates. Second, our method allows datasets that distinguish between locally transmitted and imported cases to be analysed appropriately. We describe these limitations of the previous method in more detail below. We have shown that these key features lead to improved inference of pathogen transmissibility, with illustrations using datasets from epidemics of H1N1 influenza (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), Ebola virus disease (Fig. 4) and MERS (Fig. 5). We have also implemented our modelling framework in an online tool, allowing it to be used easily in outbreak response settings by stakeholders.",

(2012) for an in-depth review). The most commonly used approach for estimating time-dependent reproduction numbers, other than the approach of Cori et al. (2013), is that of Wallinga and Teunis (2004). As described in the introduction, one caveat of the Wallinga and Teunis method is that it estimates the case reproduction number, which is not a measure of instantaneous transmissibility. If a policy-maker wishes to understand the impacts of control interventions in real-time, then an estimate of the case reproduction number is less useful than an estimate of the instantaneous reproduction number because the case reproduction number does not change immediately after interventions are altered; instead, it changes more smoothly and in a delayed manner (Fraser, 2007; Cori et al., 2013). In contrast, the instantaneous reproduction number changes straight away and is therefore a useful quantity for understanding the impacts of control strategies in real-time. Furthermore, estimation of the case reproduction number at any time usually requires incidence data from later times, although we note that extensions to the Wallinga and Teunis approach have been developed to relax this assumption of the original method (Cauchemez et al., 2006b).",

Our approach instead extends the framework of Cori et al. (2013), and relies on observations of transmission pairs in addition to the time series data to estimate the serial interval and the time-varying reproduction number in a two-step estimation process (Fig. 1).",

This potentially leads to delays between studies inferring the serial interval and subsequent analyses estimating transmissibility, or means that estimates of transmissibility are based on estimates of the serial interval from earlier outbreaks. Here, we used data from the 2013\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in Liberia to show that failing to account for full uncertainty in the serial interval distribution may lead to underestimating the uncertainty surrounding reproduction number estimates (Fig. 4c). Moreover, ignoring recent data on the serial interval can dramatically impact estimates of the reproduction number and the uncertainty associated with those estimates (Figs. 3d, 4e). This is of practical importance \u2013 as an example, a number of studies conducted during and after the 2013-16 West African Ebola outbreak (e.g. Wiratsudakul et al., 2016; Bakker and Wallinga, 2016; Dalziel et al., 2018) used the same single serial interval estimate obtained near the beginning of the outbreak (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014). Our results suggest that using the latest available data on pairs of index and secondary cases, and fully accounting for the corresponding uncertainty in the serial interval estimates, may lead to very different, but more robust estimates of the reproduction number. It is worth noting that the pairs of index/secondary cases included in the estimation should be as representative as possible; in particular, if too recent index cases are considered, some of their secondary cases may not have been observed yet, leading to artificial underestimation of the serial interval.",

(2013) is that it assumes that all cases in an outbreak (other than those observed at the first timestep) occur from local transmission, which can be erroneous. For some diseases \u2013 e.g. MERS (Funk et al., 2016) and yellow fever (Wilder-Smith and Monath, 2017) \u2013 transmission from alternative hosts (e.g. camels for MERS and non-human primates for yellow fever) can be common. Continued importation of cases into a local population from other geographical locations can also occur. For example, a number of cases of H1N1 influenza in New Zealand in 2009 were known imports from other locations (Paine et al., 2010). Failing to properly account for such non-locally transmitted cases can lead to overestimating the reproduction number, as we illustrated in our application to data on MERS in Saudi Arabia from 2014 to 2015 (Fig. 5b,c). Epidemiological studies often collect data on exposure routes for each case (Cowling et al., 2008, 2009; Forsberg White et al., 2009; Paine et al., 2010; Cori et al., 2017), and this information on the local or non-local source of incident cases should be included, when available, in estimates of pathogen transmissibility. Of course, such information might not be available directly from epidemiological data. In this case, one option might be to use statistical methods along with genetic and epidemiological data to differentiate between local and imported cases (Ypma et al., 2013; Cori et al., 2018).",

Failing to account for full uncertainty in the serial interval, not including recently available serial interval data, and failing to differentiate between local and imported cases might lead to incorrect assessment of the effectiveness of current control measures. Throughout most of this article, we discussed disease control in the context of whether or not the mean estimate of the reproduction number was less than or greater than one. However, policy-makers may prefer to choose more risk-averse policies. When the goal of interventions has been to minimise a function describing the cost of an outbreak, the idea of intervening to ensure that percentile estimates of that cost are minimised has been proposed (Tildesley et al., 2012; Cunniffe et al., 2016). A similar idea here might be directing control strategies towards ensuring that a specific percentile estimate of the reproduction number falls below one. In this context, inadequate quantification of the uncertainty surrounding reproduction number estimates may be as important as biases in the central estimates.",

Seasonal variations in the parameters governing disease spread play a significant role in transmission of a number of pathogens (Dietz, 1976; Grassly and Fraser, 2006; Fisman, 2007; van Gaalen et al., 2017). For example, transmission of vector-borne pathogens varies due to factors including seasonal temperature variation (Lord, 2004; Obolski et al., 2019), and outbreaks of childhood diseases such as measles are affected by school term dates (Earn et al., 2000). These, and indeed any factor resulting in changes in pathogen transmissibility (e.g. the depletion of the number of susceptible individuals in the population (Thompson et al., 2019a)), will be reflected in time-dependent reproduction number estimates generated using our approach, so these estimates need to be interpreted carefully when assessing the effectiveness of interventions.",

In some circumstances, the serial interval distribution might not match the generation time distribution.

This is unavoidable in most cases as surveillance systems typically do not record the timings of new infections. However, for analyses carried out retrospectively, if the distribution of the incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) is known, then it is possible to eliminate this time lag by back-calculating the likely infection times from the times at which symptoms were recorded (Fraser, 2007). The instantaneous reproduction number can then be inferred from these back-calculated data. We note that this might contribute uncertainty in reproduction number estimates if there is significant variability in the time between infection and detection of symptoms between individuals, as is the case for Ebola (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014; Hart et al., 2019).",

If information is available to quantify changes in reporting over time, this would permit correction to allow for temporal variation in underreporting, which might otherwise be interpreted as variation in the reproduction number. Underreporting has hindered estimation of disease burden for a number of diseases including dengue (Shepard et al., 2013), yellow fever (Garske et al., 2014) and Ebola (Dalziel et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2019b).

(a) MERS incidence over time, with cases imported from the animal reservoir shown in red and other cases in black (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017). (b) Estimates of Rt obtained from the incidence data shown in (a), assuming an offset Gamma distribution with mean 6.8 days and standard deviation 4.1 days for the serial interval (Cauchemez et al., 2016). Solid lines show the mean estimates and the shaded areas show the 95% credible intervals. Results shown in black ignore the information on proximity to the animal reservoir and assume all infections arose from other human cases in the dataset. Results shown in red account for the cases known to be infected from the animal reservoir. Reproduction number estimates were generated using four-weekly sliding windows (\u03c4 = 27 days). The time periods shown with shaded blue rectangles correspond to those during which the mean estimated Rt ignoring importations is above the threshold 1, whilst the mean estimated Rt accounting for importations is below 1.
