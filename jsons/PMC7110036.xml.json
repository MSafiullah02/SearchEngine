Nonetheless, tree building algorithms produce unrooted phylogenetic trees because all the processes leading to the final tree are computed as reversible (Swofford et al., 1996; Nei & Kumar, 2000; Sanderson & Shaffer, 2002). Despite its importance, however, rooting is often overlooked in phylogenetic constructions (Swofford et al., 1996).",

The MPR method places the root of the tree at the midpoint between the two most divergent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Swofford et al., 1996; Nei & Kumar, 2000), as measured by the sum of branch lengths between these OTUs. The theoretical basis of MPR relies on the assumption that all OTUs in a given tree should display the same average evolutionary rate (Tarr\u00edo et al., 2000; Huelsenbeck, Bollback & Levine, 2002). Although the midpoint rooting algorithm has been extensively used, the efficiency of this method in retrieving the correct root remains untested.",

The other data sets (named \u2018multiple outgroup data sets\u2019), however, were subject to outgroup root consistency checks (Maddison, Donoghue & Maddison, 1984). Such checks were performed by comparing the root yielded by each of the available outgroups individually. In addition, we also compared these root positions with the one obtained through the simultaneous use of all outgroups. When individual outgroups were inconsistent, but the combination of all outgroups produced a tree in which they were all joined at the same root position, we assigned that position as the outgroup root for MPR comparison purposes. These data sets were named \u2018multiple outgroup, inconsistently rooted data sets\u2019 (MOI).

Therefore, the noncondensed trees ought to remain inconclusive, even though such success rates are higher than the expected by chance (Huelsenbeck, Bollback & Levine, 2002). Condensed trees, on the other hand, allow us to place greater confidence on every branch because poorly supported branches are collapsed. Higher cut-off values are capable of reducing even further the effects of poorly supported branches. By utilizing this approach, we could briefly investigate, in more detail, whether failures in the MPR method were due to phylogenetic reconstruction problems in general.",

For example, in the SO category, it is possible that MPR retrieved the correct root whereas the single outgroup did not. In the MOC category, the trees were already quite trustworthy at the 33% cut-off threshold, which is demonstrated by the 94% MPR success rate. Results with the higher 50% condensation value corroborate this trend, as the success rate of the midpoint method remained the same.",

One would expect this to happen because the main assumption of this method (i.e. homogeneity of substitution rates along the tree, or a clock-like behaviour for the sequences) tends to be progressively violated as biological processes become more distinct between historically distant lineages (Li, 1997).",

Long-branch attraction (Felsenstein, 1978; Qiu et al., 2001; Sanderson & Shaffer, 2002) is probably the most important and debated source of failure for the outgroup method. In this case, the often long outgroup branch may be attached to other long branches in the tree, thus yielding a wrong root position. Another source of error for the outgroup rooting may be due to differences in nucleotide composition between outgroups and ingroups (Tarr\u00edo et al., 2000). The difference might confound character polarity, and thus also contribute to outgroups being clustered with OTUs based on sequences compositions rather than on their evolutionary relationships. Finally, long-edge attraction (Hendy & Penny, 1989) may also cause the outgroup to cluster with any external long branch with higher probability than to correctly place the root on one of the short internal branches.",
