The expression percentile was calculated separately within each of the four analysis sets (ACE2 in normal, ACE2 in tumor, TMPRSS2 in normal, TMPRSS2 in tumor) following two steps. First, the median expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was calculated within individual tumor types. Next, tumor types were ranked by the median expression of each gene from higher to lower, and the position of each tumor type in the ranked list was scaled to 0 to 100, hereafter regarded as \"expression percentile\" per tumor type, with smaller values indicating top-ranked tumor types. The same process was repeated for each gene in tumor samples (34 tumor types) and normal tissues (14 tumor types).",

In our analysis of ACE2/TMPRSS2 gene expression in tumors and matched normal tissues, we observe no consistent association for these factors.

Several clinical associations have arisen from a smaller series of patients infected with COVID-19. Some include risk factors for poor outcomes such as elevated body mass index (BMI) [23] and diabetes [24] as well as possible associations with race [25].

None of the acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) samples express TMPRSS2; hence 33 tumor types were used for the analysis of TMPRSS2. When ranked by expression percentile in each tumor type, cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) are among the top 25% percentile for both genes, all of which are digestive organs(Figure 1A).

Three tumor types showed elevated levels for both genes in normal tissues compared to tumors (BRCA, COAD, and LIHC) (Figure 1D). Clinical factors and HLA genotypes do not strongly associate with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in tumor or normal tissues Several clinical observations on COVID-19 indicated clinical factors such as BMI might be associated with severity [5, 23]. We sought to investigate the association between clinical variables (age, gender, race, tumor stage, tumor grade, menopause, BMI, smoking history) and ACE2 or TMPRSS2 gene expression in tumor or normal tissues from 10,038 patients. For each clinical factor, data were fitted into a two-way ANOVA model with tumor type and clinical factor as variables plus the interaction between the two. Overall we did not observe significant differences in expression for either gene when comparing designated clinical groups within tumor or normal tissues (Figure 2A to 2F) (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Outliers exist though are of unclear clinical relevance at this time (Supplementary",

ACE2 was positively correlated with ISG signature in tumor samples from 24/34 tumor types (71%, 14 reached FDR-adjusted P<0.05) and normal tissues from 10/14 tumor types (71%, 4 reached FDR-adjusted P<0.05), and negatively correlated with angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signatures (Figure 3A). TMPRSS2 showed a mixed pattern of correlations with those immune responsive or suppressive signatures (Figure 3B). We did not find a consistent pattern of ACE2 with cell subsets across all tumor types with the exception of a high positive correlation with macrophage M2 in normal tissues from kidney cancers (KIRC, KICH, KIRP) (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.84, 0.82, 0.79, FDR-adjusted P<0.0001) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (\u03c1 = 0.67, FDR-adjusted P<0.001) (Figure 3C) (Supplementary Table 9). TMPRSS2 was positively correlated with epithelial cell abundance in tumor samples from 29/33 tumor types (88%, 17 reached FDR-adjusted P<0.05) and normal tissues from 14/14 tumor types (100%, 9 reached FDR-adjusted P<0.05)",

In the cancer patient cohorts, less than 1% of the malignant cells express ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2, while few to none of the immune cells express either gene. An exploration of three studies focusing on immune cells from healthy donors (13,316 PBMCs (Immune Cell Atlas), 39,563 ileum lamina propria immunocytes (Immune Cell Atlas), 594,857 immune cells (Census of Immune Cells, EBI)) further confirmed the lack of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in immune cell populations. Realizing that other studies had reported the genes as highly expressed in lung, heart, brain, and colon, we investigated published large-scale profiling of 702,968 single cells from non-cancer patients or healthy donors (Human Cell Landscape)[38]. We found TMPRSS2 was expressed in stomach, colon, kidney, prostate, intestine, jejunum, pancreatic, esophagus, and bladder tissues, while ACE2 was only expressed in jejunum and fetal intestine. Lastly, we examined a public scRNAseq cohort from patients with COVID-19 infection (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3747336) and confirmed that ACE2 was not expressed in immune cells, and TMPRSS2 was present in six out of 140,956 cells total by one read count.",

We identified 75 taxa that showed significant and strong positive or negative correlation (Spearman's \u03c1 > 0.5 or < -0.5) with either gene in at least one pairwise correlation (FDR-adjusted P<0.05) (Figure 4A and 4B) (Supplementary Table 10). Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were the two tumor types demonstrating the strongest and most prevalent positive correlation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression with abundance of specific bacteria taxa, respectively. Kidney cancers, including renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), chromophobe (KICH), and renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), also showed positive correlations between ACE2 and microbiota if not as prevalent as colon or stomach cancers. If ranked by Spearman's correlation coefficient, Chlamydia was the top microbiota positively correlated with ACE2 in colon adenocarcinoma (\u03c1 = 0.81, FDR-adjusted P < 0.0001) (Supplementary Table 10). For both genes, those patterns were less prominent in tumor samples, which could be due to high heterogeneity in tumors. Overall we observed approximately a 2.6:1 ratio of commensal microbiota for gram-negative to positive groups in the 75 taxa (50 negatives, 19 positives, others undetermined) (Supplementary",

We were, therefore, interested in investigating associations of tissue-based microbiota and ACE2 as a surrogate for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our analysis, we found strong correlations of specific bacterial flora and high expression of ACE2 in COVID-19 related organs, including colorectal and kidney. Particularly in colorectal, where presentations with diarrhea have been widely described, we note a ratio of at least 2:1 of gram-negative bacteria in the bacteria populations significantly associated with elevated ACE2 expression. A dominance of gram-negative bacteria in the fecal microbiota is assumed at baseline, and yet disequilibrium with an increase of these bacteria is associated with diminished immunological outcomes, especially in immunosuppressed patients[50]. In our study, we have analyzed a heterogeneously collected group of tumors and match normal tissues. However, this observation suggests that further investigation of the commensal microbiome in COVID-19 and possibly that bacterial antibiosis related to coronavirus infection might be of relevance in the future.We note limitations to our report with the acknowledgment that the use of pre-existing data does not fully capture the complexity of active infection by SARS-CoV-2. Rather we sought to investigate factors correlated with viral cell engagement via ACE2 and viral entry via TMPRSS2 as possible associative risk factors that might be entertained on a clinical or translational level when considering risk for patients with cancer and otherwise of COVID-19.",
