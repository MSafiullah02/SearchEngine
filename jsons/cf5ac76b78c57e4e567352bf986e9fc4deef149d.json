However, when discussing the immediate benefits of combined PET-CT examinations, the issue of patient exposure must be taken into account as well. As shown in a multicenter study, wholebody PET-CT examinations -comprising a PET scan after the administration of the glucose analogue 2-[ 18 F] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) and a fully diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan -result in an effective dose to patients in the order of 25 mSv and thus mandate a thorough medical justification for each individual patient [5, 8] . A detailed analysis of protocols, which are representative for the imaging scenarios reported in the literature, revealed that up to 70 % of the total exposure is contributed by CT [8] . It would thus be very welcome from a radiation protection point of view if PET-CT could be replaced whenever possible by MR-PET as soon as the methodological challenges of this new imaging technology have been overcome.",

Nevertheless, there are possible risks and health effects associated with the use of diagnostic MR devices that have to be considered carefully [4, 45] . In this context, a fundamental difference between ionizing and nonionizing radiation has to be noted: Radiation doses related to CT or PET procedures may result in stochastic effects (occurring many years later), whereas biological effects of (electro)magnetic fields used in MR are of deterministic nature (occurring immediately). A stochastic process is one where the exposure determines the probability of the occurrence of an event but not the severity of the effect. In contrast, the severity of a deterministic effect is related to the level of exposure and a threshold may be defined [21] . As a consequence, the probability of detrimental effects caused by PET or CT examinations performed over many years accumulate, whereas biophysical and biological effects induced by (electro)magnetic fields used for MR examinations (such as cardiovascular reactions or peripheral nerve stimulation) are related to the acute exposure levels of a particular examination and does, to our present knowledge, not accumulate over years.",

The socalled Life Span Study (LSS) of the survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the most important of these studies [41] . The follow-up of the atomic bomb survivors has provided detailed knowledge of the relationships between radiation risk and a variety of factors, such as the absorbed dose, the age at exposure, the age at diagnosis, and other parameters. The LSS provides data with good radio-epidemiological evidence due to the large size of the study population (about 86,600 individuals with individual dose estimates), the broad age and dose distribution, the long follow-up period (about half a century), and an internal control group (individuals exposed only at a minute level or not at all). The LSS is, therefore, the major source for predicting radiation-induced risks for the general population. However, radiation risk estimates are not merely based on the follow-up of the atomic bomb survivors. They are also largely supported by a multitude of smaller studies, mostly on groups of persons exposed for medical reasons, both in diagnostics and in therapy [1] .",

Estimates on risk per unit of dose have been derived using the so-called linear, non-threshold (LNT) hypothesis, which is based on the assumptions that (a) any radiation dose -no matter how small -may cause an increase in risk and (b) the probability of this increase is proportional to the dose absorbed in the tissue. Although the risk evaluated at low dose levels is thus hypothetical, it is prudent to assume that it exists and that the LNT model represents an upper bound for it. It is for this reason that current radiation protection standards as well as risk assessments are based on the LNT hypothesis [30] .",

The aim is to judge whether the procedure will improve the diagnosis or treatment or will provide necessary information about the exposed individuals.

If the tracer is intravenously injected, the starting compartment represents the blood pool from where the material is transported to other tissue compartments representing the source regions where it accumulates and to (mainly urinary and fecal) excretion. In general, the retention in a compartment can be described by biological half-life, i.e., by a period of time within which half of the material is removed from the compartment.",

For this, absorbed fractions AF(r T \u2190 r S ) are determined, i.e., the fraction of the energy emitted in a source region r S which is absorbed in a target tissue r T . In case of non-penetrating radiation (\u03b1 and \u03b2 radiation), the simplifying assumption AF(r T \u2190 r S ) = 1 for S = T and = 0 for S \u2260 T is used for most pairs of source regions and target tissues. For penetrating radiation (\u03b3 radiation), absorbed fractions are calculated by Monte Carlo methods based on anthropomorphic phantoms which describe the position and the form of the source regions and target tissues. These phantoms were for a long time mathematical phantoms describing both source regions and target tissues by simple geometric objects. They are now being replaced by much more realistic voxel phantoms derived from MRI or CT images of real persons. For purposes of radiation protection, voxel phantoms are adjusted to the dimensions of the reference persons as defined by the ICRP [29] . Reference voxel phantoms for an adult male and female are published in ICRP Publication 110 [33] . However, AF values computed on the basis of the new models are not yet available.",

It denotes the additional risk of a person of gender S, after an exposure to organ dose D T at the age e, to be clinically diseased with a specific radiation-induced cancer at the age a or, more specifically, in the interval [a, a + 1). It is commonly calculated from with err T (e,a,D T ,S) representing the excess relative risk. For example, an err T (e,a,D T ,S) = 1 means that the additional, radiation-induced cancer risk for a person of gender S who was exposed at age e to an organ dose D T and attained age a is as high as his normal cancer risk. Estimates of the excess (relative) risk for specific organs are usually derived from cancer incidence data of the LSS, where a linear dose dependence is commonly assumed for solid tumors, while a linearquadratic approach provides better results for leukemia. The most recent models are summarized in the BEIR-VII report [1] . The site-specific excess absolute lifetime risk or lifetime attributable risk, LAR T , for a person of gender S who was exposed at age e to an organ dose D T is calculated by summing up all ear T (e,a,D T ,S) values between e + \u0394t (with \u0394t being the minimum latency period) and the age of, e.g., 85 years, commonly used for lifetime risk estimates. The ear should be corrected for competing risks by the conditional probability P(e,a), i.e., the probability that a person of age e survives beyond the age a: The minimum latency period \u0394t is the time during which the radiation-induced cancer typically does not show clinical symptoms. A \u0394t of about 5 years for carcinoma and of about 2 years for leukemia is widely applied for incidence data. To determine the total LAR for a PET examination, all site-specific LAR T estimates (i.e., for sites with appreciable organ doses) have to be summed up.",

The plots reveal that the LAR decreases markedly with increasing age at exposure and is always somewhat higher for females as compared to males. But even for young adults, the estimated radiation-induced risks are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding baseline lifetime risks, i.e., the \"normal\" risk to incur cancer during the remaining lifetime.

            "text": "There are several established biophysical mechanisms through which static magnetic fields can interact with biological tissues and organisms [44] . The two most relevant mechanisms are: Magneto-mechanical interactions. Even in a uniform magnetic field, molecules, structurally ordered molecule assemblies, or cells with a magnetic moment (e.g., outer segments of retinal rod cells, muscle fibers, filamentous virus particles, and erythrocytes) experience a mechanical torque that tends to align their magnetic moment (anti) parallel to the external magnetic field and thus to minimize the potential energy. Orientation effects, however, can only occur when molecular or cellular objects have a nonspherical structure and/or when the magnetic properties are anisotropically distributed. At higher temperatures, as, for example, in the human body, the alignment of structures with small magnetic moments is prevented by their thermal movement (Brownian movement). Additionally, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic objects are attracted in a nonuniform magnetic field, as, for example, in the periphery of an MR system, and thus can quickly become dangerous projectiles (missile effect). Magneto-hydromechanical interactions. Static magnetic fields also exert (Lorentz) forces on moving electrolytes (ionic charge carriers), giving rise to induced electric fields and currents. Since electrolytes with a positive or negative charge moving, for example, through a cylindrical blood vessel orientated perpendicular to a magnetic field are accelerated into opposite directions, this mechanism gives rise to an electrical voltage across the vessel, which is commonly referred to as a blood flow potential. In humans, the largest potentials occur across the aorta after ventricular contraction and appear superimposed on the T-wave amplitude of the ECG at fields in excess of 100 mT. A large number of studies have been conducted to detect biological responses to static magnetic fields with flux densities ranging from milliteslas to several teslas (T). These studies have been reviewed comprehensively -among others -by ICNIRP [22] and the World Health Organization [53] . Overall there is little convincing evidence from cellular, animal, human, and epidemiological studies for biologically harmful effects of short-term exposure resulting from static magnetic fields with a strength up to several teslas. Until now, most MR examinations have been performed using static magnetic fields up to 3 T, although whole-body MR systems with static magnetic fields up to 9 T are already used in clinical tests. The literature does not indicate any serious adverse health effects from the exposure of healthy human beings up to 8 T. However, sensations of nausea, vertigo, and metallic taste may occur in magnetic fields above 2 T [23] . The greatest potential health hazard comes from metallic, in particular, ferromagnetic materials (such as scissors, coins, pins, oxygen cylinders) that are accelerated in the inhomogeneous magnetic field in the periphery of an MR system and quickly become dangerous projectiles (missile effect). This risk can only be minimized by a strict and careful management of both patients and staff.",

In contrary, however, biophysical effects related to the electric fields and currents induced by their temporal variation have to be considered carefully. Rapidly switched magnetic fields induce electric fields in the human body, the strength of which is proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic field, dB/dt. In conductive media, such as biological tissues, the electric fields result in circulating eddy currents. In general, rise times of magnetic gradients in MR are longer than 100 \u03bcs, resulting in time-varying electric fields and currents with frequencies below 100 kHz. In this frequency range, the conductivity of cell membranes is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the extra-and intracellular fluid [14] . As a consequence, the current flow is restricted to the extracellular fluid and voltages are induced across the membrane of cells. When these voltages are above a tissue-specific threshold level, they can stimulate nerve and muscle cells [42] . The primary concern with regard to timevarying magnetic gradient fields is cardiac fibrillation, because it is a life-threatening condition. In contrast, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is of practical concern because uncomfortable or intolerable stimulations would interfere with the examination (e.g., due to patient movements) or would even result in a termination of the examination [51] . Bourland et al. [3] analyzed stimulation data in the form of cumulative frequency distributions that relate a dB/dt level to the number of healthy volunteers that had already reported on perceptible, uncomfortable, or even intolerable sensations. Their results indicate that the lowest percentile for intolerable stimulation is approximately 20 % above the median threshold for the perception of peripheral nerve stimulation. The threshold for cardiac stimulation is well above the median perception threshold for peripheral nerve stimulation, except at very long pulse durations which are, however, not relevant for clinical MR examinations (see Fig. 10.2, [42] ).",

In this RF range, the conductivity of cell membranes is comparable to that of the extra-and intracellular fluid which means that no substantial voltages are induced across the membranes [14] . Due to this reason, stimulation of nerve and muscle cells is no longer a matter of concern. Instead, thermal effects due to tissue heating are of importance. The increase in tissue temperature is dependent not only on localized power absorption and the duration of RF exposure but also on heat transfer and the activation of thermoregulatory mechanisms leading to thermal equalization within the body. It The limit for the controlled operating mode is given by the median perception threshold for peripheral nerve stimulation. For comparison, the threshold for cardiac stimulation is also plotted [42] is important to note that energy absorption is proportional to the square of the static magnetic field, B 0 , which means it is markedly higher at highfield as compared to low-field MR systems.",

In contrast, nonthermal (or athermal) effects are not well understood but seem -as far as this can be assessed at the moment -to have no relevance with respect to the assessment of adverse effects associated with MR examinations. According to published studies, no adverse health effects are expected if the RF-induced increase in body-core temperature of healthy persons does not exceed 1 \u00b0C [23] . However, some organs of the human body are particularly vulnerable to raised temperatures. The most sensitive organs are the testes and brain as well as portions of the eye. Since temperature changes in the various organs and tissues of the body during an MR procedure are difficult to measure in clinical routine, RF exposure is usually characterized by means of the specific absorption rate (SAR in W/kg), which is defined as the average energy dissipated in the body per unit of mass and time.",

In view of the potential risks for patients and volunteers, special ethical approval and adequate medical supervision is required. All manufacturers of MR equipment have adopted the regulations of the IEC product standard for magnetic gradient and RF fields and ensure compliance with the specified exposure limits by integrated monitor systems. With respect to the examination of patients in clinical routine, both the IEC standard and the ICNIRP guidelines recommended the following exposure limits: -Static magnetic field: The upper limit for the normal and controlled operating mode recommended by the IEC is 3 and 4 T, respectively. In its recent amendment to static magnetic fields, ICNIRP recommends 4 and 8 T, respectively. -Alternating magnetic gradient fields: The maximum recommended exposure level is set equal to a dB/dt value of 80 % of the PNS perception threshold for normal operation and 100 % of the PNS for controlled operation. To this end, perception threshold levels have to be determined by the manufacturers for a given type of gradient system by means of experimental studies on human volunteers. As an alternative, the generic hyperbolic strength-duration expression shown in Fig. 10 .2 can be used. -RF electromagnetic fields: The increase in body-core temperature is limited to 0.5 and 1.0 \u00b0C in the normal and controlled operating mode, respectively. The relatively low-temperature threshold of the normal operating mode takes into account that heat tolerance or thermoregulation may be compromised in some individuals, such as the elderly, infants, and patients with certain medical conditions and/or taking certain medications. Additionally, local temperatures under exposure to the head, trunk, and extremities are limited to 38, 39, and 40 \u00b0C, respectively. For MR practice, the SAR limits summarized in Table 10 .3 have been derived on the basis of experimental and theoretical studies. They should not be exceeded in order to limit the temperature rise to the stated values. But even then, severe burns can occur under unfavorable conditions at small focal skin-to-skin contact zones (e.g., between the calves). Therefore, patients should always be positioned in such a way that focal skin-to-skin contacts are avoided.",

This risk can only be minimized by a careful interview of the patient, evaluation of the patient's file, and contacting the implanting clinician and/or the manufacturer for advice on MR safety and compatibility of the implant. MR examinations of patients with active implants are strictly contraindicated, provided that the patient implant card does not explicitly state their safety in the MR environment. Comprehensive information on the MR-compatibility of implants and other metallic objects is available in a reference manual published by Shellock [46] and online at www.MRIsafety.com.

There are a few studies indicating that static [37] and low-frequency [17, 35, 38, 52] magnetic fields might enhance the genotoxic potential of ionizing radiation. Moreover, it is well recognized that mild hyperthermia, as, for example, caused by RF fields, has a radiosensitizing effect in tumors [18, 47] . In the light of the developing MR-PET technology, further biological studies are thus urgently required to investigate -for exposure levels and examination scenarios that will occur at MR-PET systems -whether there are synergistic effects in normal tissues and, if so, to clarify their relevance for risk assessment of patients that will be examined with this innovative imaging modality.",

In this context it has to be noted that -contrary to a common opinion held among MR users -the SAR limits given in Table 10 .3 do not relate to an individual MR sequence but rather to running SAR averages computed over each 6 min period, which is assumed to be a typical thermal equilibration time (Brix [7] ).
