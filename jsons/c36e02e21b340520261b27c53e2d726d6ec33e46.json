In leech (Theromyzon tessulatum), brain neurons immunoreaction to angiotensin II has been described [30] and immunocytes showed immunoreactivity to antihuman-Ang II and antihuman AT1 receptors [29, 30] . Also, an asparyl protease of 32 kDa exhibiting 35% of sequence identity with mammalian renin, has been found in the leech [28, 30] . Biochemically, renin, ACE-and AT1-like receptor were identified in the leech immune cells [28] and ACE has been found in bacteria [26] . So far, only soluble, single domain ACEs from invertebrates have been cloned, and these have been implicated in reproduction in insects [18] . Interestingly, bacterial DNA sequences could encode putative ACE-like proteins, strikingly similar to vertebrates enzymes [26] . ACEs from invertebrates have been isolated from insects like Drosophila melanogaster [5] showing kinetics very similar to mammalian ACE [26] . Immunochemical studies indicated ACE intracellularly co-localized with myotropine peptides suggesting a convertase activity [18] . Immunostaining of leech sections, revealed labeling in neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), immunocytes, the nephridial canal canaliculi and the periphery of the ciliated funnel, as well as the epithelium lining nephridia. Renin is localized in the excretory system and in the nervous system of leech [29, 30] and its first appearance has been detected in bony fish [16] . The first genomic characterization of non-mammalian vertebrates renin genes found in zebrafish was recently described [22] . According to Fournier et al. [16] , practically all components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system appear in bony fish with exception of Mas receptor of Ang (1-7) which appeared in amphibians.",

Measurements of transepithelial short-circuit current in leeches, showed that Ang II amide reduced this current-an effect mediated by Cl\u2212 secretion [25, 31] and in consequence, water follows the peptide eliciting water loss across the epithelium.",

The RAAS is involved in the regulation of cell volume in normal mammalian heart as well as in the failing heart [7] . Indeed, in myocytes isolated from the failing ventricle and exposed to renin plus angiotensinogen or to Ang II, an increase of cell volume was seen concurrently with the inhibition of the sodium pump [7] while the intracellular administration of Ang II had an opposite effect [9] . The activation of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter is involved in the effect of Ang II because bumetanide abolished the swelling induced by the peptide [9] . The regulation of cell volume, involves other components like ion channels and their voltage dependence. Cell swelling induced by Ang II in cardiac cells, causes the activation of ionic channels like the swelling-activate chloride current (I Cl,swell ) [3] leading to membrane depolarization, reduction of action potential duration [7] and consequent changes in cardiac excitability. The increase of (I Clswell ) in the failing and in the normal mammalian heart [3, 8] elicited by changes in cell metabolism or by Ang II, is particularly relevant because the activation of this current seems involved in generation of cardiac arrhythmias including early after depolarizations [8] .",

It is known, for instance, that Ang II causes cell swelling and increases ICl swell in the failing as well as in normal heart [3, 8] and that the inability of the heart cell to regulate its volume through a lack of activation of the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) leads to serious impairment of heart cell function [21] . Components of the renin angiotensin system in the myocardium [19] play an important role on regulation of cell volume and water transport because extracellular Ang II or renin inhibit the sodium pump, counteracts the decline in cell volume. On the other hand, when the cell is exposed to hypotonic medium, the increment of cell volume can be reduced by intracellular Ang II or renin [7] . In this way, RAAS components contribute to the regulation of cell volume. This physiological property of Ang II is quite old because evidence is available that the peptide suppressed body weight loss of the clam worm Perinereis sp. under a hyper-osmotic condition, and enhanced body weight gain under a hypo-osmotic condition [31] .",

The increase in cell volume caused by extracellular Ang II in cardiac cells of the mammalian heart, for instance, was enhanced when the cells were incubated with aldosterone for 48 h [13] -an effect abolished by spironolactone. The mineralocorticoid receptor is an important component of the intracrine action of Ang II because the decline in cell volume elicited by intracellular administration of Ang II, was increased by aldosterone and inhibited by spironolactone [13] . The effects of aldosterone and spironolactone were related, in part, to a change in expression of AT1 receptors at surface cell membrane [13] .",

Since cell swelling induced by myocardial ischemia or heart failure, represents an important arrhythmogenic mechanism, the formation of Ang (1-7) through the activation of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis might be of benefit to the ischemic heart [9] . The beneficial effect of angiotensin (1-7) on impulse propagation seen under these conditions, is related to the activation of the sodium pump and hyperpolarization of cell membrane [11] . ACE2 is over-expressed during heart failure leading to a higher formation of Ang (1-7) [41] and recent findings indicate that angiotensin (1-7) increments the sodium pump and reduces the cell volume by 15% within 25 min in the failing heart [7, 9] . It is then conceivable, that the improvement of cardiac function and decreased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias during ischemia/reperfusion elicited by Ang (1-7), be related, at least in part, to the decrease of heart cell volume. According to these observations, the balance between ACE and ACE2 expression seems to be a determinant factor on the regulation of heart cell function and volume. Although evidence is available that the Mas receptor for Ang (1-7) first appear in amphibians [16] , no information is available on the role of the hexapeptide on cell volume and water transport on invertebrates.",
