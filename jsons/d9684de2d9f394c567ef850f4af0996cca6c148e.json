Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus responsible for the outbreak of respiratory illness known as COVID-19, has sickened more than 95,000 people and killed more than 3,200, most in China, as of Mar 5th, 2020. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia ranges from mild to critical cases, among which the diagnosis of ordinary, severe and critical cases were all correlated with chest CT findings 5, 6 . Previously published studies have described the general typical and atypical CT image manifestations 6, 7 , the time-course evolution of CT findings 8, 9 , the correlation between CT features and clinical features 1, 10 , and evaluated the CT severity of patients with COVID pneumonia 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In order to reduce or eliminate the subjectivity in the qualitative and semi-quantitative visual evaluation of CT severity scores 8, 15, 17 , quantitative approaches for assessing lung opacification percentage of the whole lung have developed, such as deep learning method 18 , computer tool 16 or the calculation method of combing mean attenuation values and opacity volumes 14 . However, these quantitative analysis methods did not fully specify information characterizing and quantifying different clinical stages with CT features, especially for critical cases. 7 patients were included with demographics and clinical characteristics recorded. The flowchart of patient selection is shown in Figure 1 .",

The predominant abnormal chest CT pattern observed was bilateral and peripheral GGO and consolidation 6, 23 , the frequency of the former was not specific in identifying the cases in different clinical stages. This can be explained by the pathological findings that early alveolar damage caused by virus invasion into pulmonary interstitium includes alveolar edema, protein exudate and thickening of the interlobular interstitium 32,33 which will evolve to diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudate as the disease progresses to the critical stage 34 , both manifesting as GGO. From the ordinary stage to the severe/critical stage, in more severe cases, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram all increased, making the total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation significantly higher in the severe/critical cases compared to the ordinary cases.

The residual relative volume of normal lung density might be related to the lung function 37 . In our critical cases, eight patients with residual normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, two of them had died. The substantial difference in the relative volume of residual normal lung density among the three groups, indicating the value is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis. The similar LAV values of the three COVID-19 pneumonia groups to the normal CT groups indicated that no obvious sign of emphysema observed in pneumonia at the initial CT scan, as the setting of the LAV threshold for emphysema was -950 HU 30 . The HAV values increased in more severe cases, indicating an increase in high-density lesions and providing evidence that the total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could be as a qualitative indicator for evaluating disease progression. The higher HAV values (above than -200 HU) in the critical cases also helped explain why the total lung volume within the preset threshold range of -950HU and -200HU lower than the ordinary/severe cases.",

The evolution of diverse CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia with time 8 and the interobserver variability of imaging assessment would make the visually accurate evaluation or staging of the disease difficult. However, the method of quantitative analysis of pneumonia based on the lung density and volume changes was standard, except for the manual adjustment if necessary to ensure the accuracy of automatic lung segmentation using the software, which would make it easier and objective for radiologists to evaluate the extent of disease. Different from previous quantitative studies 14,16,18 which evaluated the extent of the disease by quantifying the CT lung opacification percentage using a deep-learning, computer or computation-based method, our study assessed the extent of pulmonary changes and the severity of COVID-19 by quantifying the relative volume of normal lung density using a commercial CT Pulmo 3D software, which would provide valuable knowledge and a feasible clinical tool for the management of these patients and broaden the technical spectrum of lung quantitative analysis.",
