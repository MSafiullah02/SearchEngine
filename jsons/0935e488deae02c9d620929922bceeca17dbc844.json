It is essential to be prepared in advance. Awaiting the first COVID-19 patient's arrival and then improvising corresponds to waiting for a disaster. Several instructions on how to manage a Cath lab during the COVID-19 pandemic have already been provided by different scientific societies. 1,2 Here, we simply report our thoughts based on common sense, as nobody at present has any reliable data.",

Today, the first priority is the safety of the team: a team in quarantine means the inability to save many more patients. Radiological protection is needed, but it is not enough. It should be combined with effective protection from the virus. Time to revascularization remains a priority, but patient outcome does not change much if extra time is taken to secure the workforce first. The room and the team need to be well prepared to receive positive or suspected COVID-19 patients by wearing personal protective equipment including gloves, gowns, goggles, shields, glasses, and FFp3 or N95 masks. Therefore, the first priority is to prepare each team beforehand. Cath lab directors have to:",

It is reasonable to postpone elective procedures, at least after telephone communication for a clinical assessment of the real needs of the patient; (v) in line with the above, staff shortages (including the possibility of being infected and quarantined) should be anticipated and a rescue plan should be put in place; (vi) finally, human factors are vital; every effort should be made to maintain effective teambuilding and to allow sufficient time for listening to problems and concerns.",

It is universally accepted (although no definitive data are available) that since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are experiencing fewer admissions for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This is surprising. Actually, it should be the opposite. Like all other infections, COVID-19 is expected to favour plaque instability and cause more myocardial infarctions (MIs). 3 Media campaigns (TV, radio, newspapers, social media, etc.) recommend not to overcrowd the emergency department, and. . . 'Stay at home' is the current, consistent, message. Patients are afraid to go to the hospital and become infected, so they prefer to stay at home, even with chest pain. All of this is wrong. Patients should be reassured about the safety of hospitals with areas for COVID-19 patients separated from the others. The message should be reformulated: 'Business as usual. If you have chest pain, call an ambulance. The risk of mortality for MI outweighs that of COVID-19 infection'. Indeed, scientists and epidemiologists will appropriately investigate this phenomenon and find out whether remodulation of the healthcare system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more non-hospital casualties for ACS.",

The regional government has reduced this to 13 hospitals with Cath labs now acting as hubs, with the remainder acting as spokes. Patients are referred to a hub on the basis of geographic proximity. The same model has been applied to other cardiovascular emergencies (e.g. stroke). 7 Ideally, a dedicated Cath lab should be located in a COVID-19 area of the hospital, but this may not always be possible. In the latter case, a 'temporary' COVID-19 lab and procedure with a protected team needs to be set up for each patient. This might require a longer time. If the Cath lab is not ready, our suggestion is that patients wait in the ambulance rather than in the pre-operating room.",

Positive cases should follow the same protocol as STEMI patients, if they cannot be managed by optimal medical therapy. Rapid discharge of these non-STEMI patients after revascularization is recommended to maximize bed availability and to reduce exposure within the hospital. Whenever possible, these patients should be followed-up at home via telemedicine. In both instances, transportation of suspected or positive COVID-19 patients from the Cath lab to the appropriate area of the hospital (either known COVID-19 or just suspect) should occur with protected staff following pre-determined pathways and safe corridors. At the end of each procedure, the necessary cleaning time for the Cath lab should be allowed. Whenever possible, these cases should be scheduled at the end of the working day, not to compromise the procedures which follow.",
