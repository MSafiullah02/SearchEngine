            "text": "The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a novel virus of the coronavirus family, SARSCoV-2. Patients with the coronavirus pneumonia have a fever, and the temperature above 38 degrees with symptoms such as dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea[5], [6], [12]. Thrombotic complications are also commonly reported such as acute pulmonary embolism[14], [23]. This pneumonia was first discovered in December 2019 in the South China Seafood Market Hubei Province, China11. There is a high contagiosity for this disease. This pneumonia has now turned into a pandemic: Tens of thousands of people are infected worldwide.HypothesisA recent pre-print study8 shows that ORF8 and surface glycoproteins of the novel coronavirus could combine to the porphyrin to form a complex. Meanwhile, orf1ab, ORF10, and ORF3a proteins could coordinate attack the heme (porphyrin), formed into the mitochondria, on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin to dissociate the iron ions from the heme. Furthermore, it revealed that Favipiravir could inhibit the envelope protein and ORF7a protein bind to porphyrin, thus preventing the virus from entering host cells, and catching free porphyrins. Explain here also quickly potential mechanisms of chloroquine if possible.\n",

Regressions will provide the values of the 3 parameters / degrees of freedom of the logistic curve: its maximum (L), the abscissa of its midpoint (x0), and its growth rate (k).
