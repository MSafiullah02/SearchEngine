Accumulating evidence indicates that G6PD deficiency affects cells other than those of erythrocytes. For example, G6PD deficiency is now known to affect oocyte development and/or survival as well as growth and senescence of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). Moreover, human G6PD-deficient neutrophils exhibit impaired production of nitric oxide, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, which may explain the impaired bactericidal effect of these cells [2]. Taken together, these findings indicate that G6PD deficiency causes abnormal cellular redox, thus affecting cells other than red cells. Oxidative stress is known to affect viral proliferation and virulence [3]; however, the effect of G6PD deficiency on viral infectivity has not been thoroughly studied",

Recent identification of a novel coronavirus as a causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has received substantial clinical attention.

Because the actual nucleocapsid gene expression did not differ significantly between HFF1 and HFF3 at 2 h after infection, gene expression at 2 h after infection was normalized to 1. In HFF1, viral gene expression at 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after infection was 2-, 29-, 468-, and 1801-fold higher than at 2 h after infection, respectively. However, in HFF3, viral gene expression at 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after infection was 1-, 6-, 47-, and 155-fold higher than at 2 h after infection, respectively (table 1). To determine whether the enhanced viral gene expression of G6PD-deficient fibroblasts after HCoV 229E infection was cell specific, G6PD-knockdown cells derived from human A549 lung epithelial cells were used. Three stable G6PD-knockdown cell lines\u2014A549\u20135.8, A549\u20135.18, and A549\u20135.20\u2014were selected, as was a control cell line transfected with pCI-neo vector only, A549\u20135S-5 (figure 1A). Likewise, viral gene expression was similar in G6PD-knockdown A549 cells and revealed a much higher increase than in control cells (table 1).

The expression of CD13 in LGIN and LKGIN did not differ significantly from that in the control LEIN (data not shown). However, LGIN and LKGIN showed less susceptibility to HCoV 229E\u2013induced cell death (12% vs. 18%) than LEIN at 72 h after infection (data not shown). Subsequent determination of viral gene expression revealed significantly less expression in LGIN and LKGIN than in LEIN control cells (table 1).

Conversely, enhanced production of viral particles in G6PD-deficient cells was clearly demonstrated by increased plaque formation (figure 1) and elevated viral gene expression (table 1) after virus infection.
