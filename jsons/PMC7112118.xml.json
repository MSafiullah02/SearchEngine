            "text": "Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has been an object of intense scientific study for more than a century and was the first virus to be so-named (Beijerinck, 1898). The fact that it could be propagated and purified in large quantities led to TMV being at the forefront of developments in modern virology and molecular biology (recently reviewed by Lomonossoff, 2018). As a result of these fundamental studies, by the 1980s there was a huge amount of data available concerning both the molecular genetics of the virus and the structure of its particles. This led to a burgeoning interest in the use of TMV, and its constituent parts, in bio- and nanotechnology. Such uses have included: the identification and development of translational enhancers for the enhanced expression of heterologous genes (Gallie et al., 1987a; Wilson, 1989), the development of efficient vectors for transient expression and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in plants (reviewed by Peyret and Lomonossoff, 2015), and the use of virus-derived sequences for the creation of virus-resistant lines of plants (Golemboski et al., 1990; Powell Abel et al., 1986). Consideration of all these aspects would require an extremely long article, possibly even a book. Thus, this review will concentrate on the contributions that TMV particles, and their assembly properties, have made to bionanotechnology.",

The genome of TMV consists of one molecule of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 6395 nucleotides that contains only three open reading frames (ORFs; Goelet et al., 1982; Fig. 1A; Note: All the numbers quoted here and below refer to the U1 or vulgare strain of TMV unless otherwise specified). The 5\u2032-proximal ORF encodes the 126 and 183 kDa proteins, the longer of which is produced via read-through of a leaky UAG stop codon at the end of the 126 kDa coding sequence; both these proteins are translated from the genomic RNA and are involved in the replication of the viral RNA (Young et al., 1987; Fig. 1A). To the 3\u2032 side of this ORF lie the regions encoding the 30 kDa viral movement protein (MP) and the 17.5 kDa coat protein (CP); both the MP and CP are translated from subgenomic mRNAs (Beachy and Zaitlin, 1977; Hunter et al., 1976).",

The particles are hollow cylinders 300 nm in length with external and internal diameters of 18 and 4 nm, respectively. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of both the assembled particles and the CP subunits have been subjected to detailed analysis over many years by electron microscopy, fiber diffraction, and X-ray crystallography. These have resulted in an atomic-resolution picture of the viral particles and the protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interactions that hold them together (Bloomer et al., 1978; Champness et al., 1976; Namba et al., 1989; Stubbs et al., 1977). Recently, TMV single-particle 3D reconstructions to 3.2 \u00c5 resolution have been achieved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) using direct electron detectors confirming that fiber diffraction and cryo-EM yield equivalent data (Fromm et al., 2015).",

Each subunit comprises four \u03b1-helices with both the N- and C-termini lying on the external surface of the particle. At pHs above neutrality, the isolated CP assembles into a variety of two-layer structures, including a disk aggregate that has more recently been referred to as a \u201cnanoring\u201d (Bhyravbhatla et al., 1998; Bloomer et al., 1978; Durham et al., 1971; Fig. 1C). Within the fully assembled particles, the subunits form a right-handed helix with a pitch of 2.3 nm with 16\u2153 subunits per turn, resulting in an average distance of about 2.5 nm between the N- or C-termini, respectively, of adjacent CPs (Fig. 1D and E). The RNA lies at a radius of 4 nm and three nucleotides are associated with each CP subunit (Franklin, 1956). The purified CP forms helical rods in the absence of RNA at pH less than 6.0. These rods have an identical structure to the virus but are of indeterminate length, suggesting that the RNA effectively acts as a ruler that determines the particle length.",

            "text": "In addition to the detailed structural information about the genome and the virus particles, there is another feature about TMV that has made the virus of great interest for potential applications in bionanotechnology: the availability of a self-assembly system that can operate both in vivo and in vitro. Ever since the discovery that purified CP and RNA can self-assemble to produce infectious virus particles in vitro (Fraenkel-Conrat and Williams, 1955), TMV has become a paradigm for RNA\u2013protein recognition. In the 1970s it was shown that assembly is initiated at a single \u201corigin of assembly sequence\u201d (OAS) positioned approximately 1 kb from the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA (Zimmern, 1977; Zimmern and Butler, 1977; Zimmern and Wilson, 1976). Initiation of the process requires that the CP be in the form of a subassembly, consisting of a two-layer disk aggregate, rather than individual subunits or the helical aggregates that the CP can form under acidic conditions (Butler and Klug, 1971); the disks, containing 34 CP subunits (Fig. 1C), interact with a hairpin structure formed by the OAS. Assembly then proceeds bidirectionally (Butler et al., 1977), with assembly toward the 5\u2032 end of the RNA being considerably faster than that toward the 3\u2032 end. This is due to an asymmetric mode of particle growth: further CP disks or smaller two-layer aggregates are added at the 5\u2032-protruding traveling loop of the viral RNA (Fig. 2\n), pulling the 5\u2032 end the RNA through the central channel of the nascent particle. Assembly toward the 3\u2032 end of the RNA occurs through the addition of smaller CP oligomers, and this portion of the RNA remains accessible until assembly is complete. For detailed reviews of these seminal studies on TMV self-assembly, the reader is referred to Butler, 1984, Butler, 1999 and Lomonossoff and Wilson (1985). In addition to controlled assembly of TMV rods, it is also possible to sequentially remove protein subunits to expose the 5\u2032 end of the RNA within rods by treatment at alkaline pH (Perham and Wilson, 1978). The processes of controlled nucleoprotein assembly and disassembly have been exploited to generate TMV-derived nanostructures and hybrid nanoobjects as discussed later (Fig. 2).",

To avoid disrupting CP intersubunit contacts and thereby interfering with particle formation, it is essential that any inserted peptides be presented on a solvent-exposed surface; this should also ensure an effective interaction with the immune system if the displayed peptides are intended to provoke an immune response. The most commonly used position for the fusion of peptides to the CP is the C-terminus (Fig. 1), which lies on the outer surface of assembled virions. Though the N-terminus is also surface-exposed, attempts at fusing peptides to this position have generally prevented particle formation, probably because of the proximity of amino acids, such as the buried invariant tyrosine at position 2, critical for particle formation (Altschuh et al., 1987).",

            "text": "An early report of the use TMV particles to present peptides involved the CP expressed in Escherichia coli (Haynes et al., 1986; discussed in Section 4). The first attempt to produce TMV particles containing a modified CP in plants was reported by Takamatsu et al. (1990). A sequence encoding Leu-enkephalin was fused to the C-terminus of the viral CP in an infectious cDNA clone of the virus. Inoculation of tobacco plants gave only local lesions, and no particles could be purified despite the efficient synthesis of the modified CP. This was the first indication of a significant problem with using TMV particles to display foreign peptides. Although the large number of subunits within a virus particle makes TMV very attractive as a potential peptide display system, it has the drawback that the subunits are very tightly packed, allowing little space on the virus surface for the accommodation of multiple copies of a heterologous peptide. In addition, mutations near the C-terminus adversely affect the ability of CP subunits to oligomerize (Li et al., 2013), thereby compromising assembly. Nonetheless, the successful formation of particles was later reported when an 11-amino acid epitope from VP1 of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) was fused to the extreme C-terminus of the CP (Wu et al., 2003). The purified particles could protect a number of target animals, including pigs, against challenge with FMDV. Hexahistidine tags were also shown to be tolerated as 3\u2032-terminal extensions to all TMV CPs but substantially reduced particle formation (Mueller et al., 2010).",

            "text": "An initial approach to solving the problem of steric crowding was the creation of mosaic particles containing a mixture of wild-type and modified subunits. This was achieved by incorporating a leaky termination codon at the C-terminus of the CP gene and placing the sequence of the target, antigenic peptides immediately downstream (Hamamoto et al., 1993; Sugiyama et al., 1995; Turpen et al., 1995). This resulted in the production of particles in which up to 5% of the subunits were fusion proteins containing the heterologous peptide at their C-termini. However, in each case the presented peptide was quite short (less than 20 amino acids). A conceptually similar, but mechanistically different, approach to creating mosaic particles was adopted by R\u00f6der et al. (2017) to express longer peptides. In this case the sequence of the 113-amino acid fluorescent protein iLOV was fused to the C-terminus of the CP via a 16-amino acid 2A \u201cribosomal skip\u201d peptide from FMDV (Donnelly et al., 2001). Particles isolated from plants infected with this construct contained iLOV fusion subunits, suggesting this approach could be used to express whole proteins on the surface of TMV particles.",

            "text": "The disadvantage of the mosaic approach is that it is difficult to control the number and spatial distribution of modified subunits within the particles. Thus, several alternative approaches for peptide insertion into the CP have been developed to produce particles in which all the CP subunits are modified while retaining virus viability. Turpen et al. (1995) investigated the use of a surface-exposed loop, downstream of proline 63, between two of the \u03b1-helices (Fig. 1A and B), to express malarial epitopes on the virus surface, and demonstrated particle formation. A similar site was later used to express a 10-amino acid metal-binding peptide that catalyzed the deposition of gold on the surface of purified particles (Love et al., 2015). Using a TMV vector that allowed peptides to be inserted just upstream of the C-terminus of the CP (after amino acid 154), Fitchen et al. (1995) expressed a 13-amino acid peptide from the glycoprotein ZP3 from the murine zona pellucida. A detailed analysis of the size and charge of peptides that could be successfully displayed at this site (Bendahmane et al., 1999) showed that sequences of up to 23 amino acids were tolerated provided their isoelectric point was below 7.0. Using this information, Koo et al. (1999) displayed peptides of either 10 or 15 amino acids from the spike protein of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus on the surface of assembled particles. When purified virions were used to immunize mice, animals with high antibody titers were protected from subsequent challenge with infectious murine hepatitis virus. This was a highly significant result as it showed, for the first time, that TMV particles expressing a foreign epitope could act as effective candidate vaccines. It also cemented the idea that modified plant virus particles can act as candidate vaccines as originally demonstrated with cowpea mosaic virus (Dalsgaard et al., 1997). Subsequently, Staczek et al. (2000) demonstrated protection using an epitope from the outer membrane protein F of Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressed at the same site in the virus particles, and, more recently, Petukhova et al. (2013) were able to demonstrate protective immunity in mice using TMV particles displaying the influenza virus M2e epitope at a site near the C-terminus of the CP.",

This sparked the development of a number of approaches to increasing the size of peptides that can be presented by modifying the C-terminus of the CP. By deleting four to six amino acids from the C-terminus amino acids of the CP, Jiang et al. (2006) were able to present a peptide of 25 amino acids from FMDV VP1 on the virus surface\u2014a modest increase over the previously reported maximum. An alternative approach has been to insert linker sequences between the C-terminus and the sequence to be presented. By incorporating a 15-amino acid linker, Werner et al. (2006) were able to display a 133-amino acid segment of protein A, on the surface of particles of a close relative of TMV, the tobamovirus turnip vein clearing virus\u2014a dramatic increase over what had been reported previously. The protein A fragment could bind IgG indicating that the modified virus particles could potentially be used to purify antibodies. Using a similar linker strategy, Frolova et al.

However, in several cases the presence of these added residues adversely affected virus yield. To address this, Smith et al. (2006) screened a collection of random TMV mutants that had additional amino acids, including a single lysine, inserted near the N-terminus of the CP. By selecting those mutants that grew well, the authors were able to identify a mutant suitable for the chemical coupling of a variety of peptides (McCormick and Palmer, 2008).",

Such tubes can be grown from deposited clusters of palladium, platinum, and gold on the exterior TMV surface and result in a metallic coat on the virion that serves as a basal layer for electroless plating of other metals including nickel and cobalt. For example, Royston et al. (2008) reported the deposition of nickel and cobalt on the exterior surface of the virus to create metallic coatings up to 40 nm in thickness. When the nickel-coated virions were incorporated into a nickel\u2013zinc battery system, the electrode capacity of the battery more than doubled due to the large increase of its active surface area through the TMV-derived nanostructures. Similarly, TMV nanorods immobilized on semiconducting electrodes and coated with nickel from solution, and subsequently with indium\u2013tin oxide and copper oxide layers by sputtering and annealing, yielded excellently performing photoelectrochemical cells. The performance of these structures also profited from the antireflective properties of the 3D nanorod structures (Chiang et al., 2012). Hydrogen generation in these water-splitting solar cells resulted in higher photocurrent densities than reported previously for any other system based on similarly sized copper oxide structures.",

However, Czapar et al. (2016) made use of the density of negative charges lining the inner channel to load TMV particles with a potent platinum-based anticancer agent, phenanthriplatin (PhenPt). When TMV rods were incubated with a cationic form of the drug, approximately 2000 PhenPt2\n+ cations were incorporated, consistent with the idea that binding occurs through ionic interaction with the carboxylate groups lining the inner channel of the virus particles. The drug could be released by lowering the pH of the medium. Subsequent work using TMV particles loaded with a related drug, cisplatin, showed that TMV particles are an efficient way of delivering anticancer therapeutics (Franke et al., 2017).",

However, Shire et al. (1990) found that wild-type TMV CP produced in E. coli was unable to assemble with TMV RNA in vitro, a problem also encountered when expression of modified forms of CP was attempted (Bruckman et al., 2011; Wnek et al., 2013). The alternative approach of coexpressing the CP and RNA molecules containing the OAS within bacteria or yeast cells was only partially successful, with only a small number of virus-like particles or correctly formed rods being obtained (Hwang et al., 1994; Kadri et al., 2013). The aberrant assembly properties of CP expressed in bacteria have been ascribed to the lack of acetylation of the N-terminal serine, which prevents the formation of the disk structures necessary to initiate the process (Shire et al., 1990; Wnek et al., 2013). This problem could be alleviated by spiking the E. coli-produced protein with a minimum of 20% of plant-made TMV CP, an approach that enabled efficient RNA-guided assembly of TMV-CPHis6 into particles of the expected length (Eiben et al., 2014). This approach, akin to the production of mosaic particles in plants, provides a further option for tailoring the properties and addressability of TMV-like particles assembled in vitro.",

It soon transpired that tobacco plants transgenic for the TMV CP were resistant to subsequent challenge with virus (Powell Abel et al., 1986), and the concept of \u201ccoat protein-mediated resistance\u201d was born (Beachy, 1999).

No detectable material accumulated when the CP was expressed alone, indicating that assembly is crucial for CP accumulation in plants. However, when the CP was expressed in the presence of RNA molecules containing the OAS, virus-like rods readily formed, the length of which was controlled by the length of the RNA. Furthermore, it was possible to fuse a nine-amino acid cobalt\u2013platinum (CoPt)-binding peptide to the C-terminus of the CP without abolishing particle assembly in planta. CoPt could be deposited on the surface of particles harboring the peptide but not on particles containing wild-type CP (Saunders and Lomonossoff, 2017).

The surface of TMV has a strong stabilizing effect on different enzymes, including glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase (Baecker et al., 2017; Koch et al., 2015), and penicillinase (Koch et al., 2018; Poghossian et al., 2018). The use of TMV adapter rods on sensor surfaces (see below) also has enabled bioaffinity-based display of streptavidin conjugates of these enzymes at surface densities not achievable on TMV-free supports, with the additional advantages of increased reusability and enhanced target detection ranges of such devices. Thus, it is anticipated that high-performance biosensors employing TMV rods will soon be used in proof-of-concept applications.",

This has been exploited for increasing the efficiency of energy storage and conversion devices as outlined earlier. To generate controlled arrays of TMV particles, Yi et al., 2005, Yi et al., 2007 partially disassembled the CP from TMV particles to expose the RNA at the 5\u2032 end of the rods. Oriented assembly of TMV on solid supports was then achieved in a controlled manner via nucleic acid hybridization using complementary oligonucleotides. By this approach, the immobilization of fluorescently labeled TMV onto electrodes could be demonstrated. Furthermore, by using differentially labeled TMV particles in conjunction with a micropatterned substrate, it was possible to construct a patterned TMV microarray (Tan et al., 2008). An alternative approach made use of the viral self-assembly mechanism predicted to function not only in solution but also on 3\u2032-terminally immobilized RNAs containing the viral OAS sequence. Indeed it was possible to grow nanostick arrays bottom-up on different solid supports, including prepatterned flat substrates, with covalently conjugated RNA scaffolds (Mueller et al., 2011), and on DNA-programmed gold nanobeads after sequence-selective hybridization of RNAs via their 3\u2032 ends. This resulted in the formation of nanostar colloids with an adjustable number of TMV arms with varying lengths (Eber et al., 2013). Such composite structures suggest themselves as carrier colloids for functional molecules, with applications ranging from separation to biodetection methods.",

This problem was solved by sequentially alternating layer-by-layer application of two differently charged TMV variants yielding stable multilayer films that could be converted into free-standing TMV membranes that, in turn, could be used as tissue engineering supports (Tiu et al., 2017). One of the most rapidly advancing applications of TMV carrier templates is the preparation of surfaces that foster cell attachment and differentiation. TMV-coated culture supports appear to have advantages for the cultivation of certain cells; they also enable the spatially defined presentation of peptide ligands over nanometric distances. Applications, such as the osteogenesis of bone marrow stem cells on arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid peptide-fashioned TMV layers, have been extensively explored (Kaur et al., 2010; Sitasuwan et al., 2014). Tissue engineering approaches, making use of TMV as a carrier for cell-binding peptide motifs to mimic extracellular matrix proteins, also include the production of mats made from electrospun composite polymer\u2013virus nanorod fibers for improved handling (Wu et al., 2011) and layouts combining 3D nanostructures with TMV-based effector rods (reviewed by Wen and Steinmetz, 2016; Zhao et al., 2015; Fig. 2).",

The TMV rods enhanced and fine-tuned magnetoviscosity of the fluids to an unexpected extent and suppressed shear thinning in a length- and surface charge-dependent manner (Fig. 2). As rheological fluids are employed for such purposes as vacuum-tight sealing of rotating shafts or for damping or heat transfer tasks in technical equipment, the study suggested previously unforeseen applications for TMV-based particles. TMV-like particles of differing length grown in situ on solid flat or bead supports (see above) yielded high-surface density arrays of carrier rods in nanobrush and nanostar layouts (Azucena et al., 2012; Eber et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2011; Fig. 3).",

This conversion is accompanied by a change in the secondary structure of the subunits from a primarily \u03b1-helical structure to one that contains a significant proportion of \u03b2-sheet (Dobrov et al., 2014). These spherical particles have proved to be an effective platform for displaying antigens (Karpova et al., 2012) and have been investigated as delivery vehicles for anticancer drugs (Bruckman et al., 2016). The molecular organization of these TMV derivatives retains the right-side-out orientation of the viral components with CP termini accessible on the outer surface of the nanospheres.",

In some ways it seems amazing that so simple a structure, consisting of multiple copies of a single type of protein and a single molecule of RNA, could be the object of such intense study for over 100 years. However, it is this very simplicity that has made TMV such a tractable system both for fundamental studies and, latterly, for exploitation for applications in bionanotechnology. Indeed, the number of publications regarding the uses of TMV particles continues to increase rapidly, so much so that it is difficult to keep pace with all the developments and certainly to do them all justice in a review of this length. However, we hope that we have at least given our readers an insight into how basic research has been translated into possible applications.",
