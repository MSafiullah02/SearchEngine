Although several studies analyzed prognostic factors for fatal outcome,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 predictive factors for pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure have not been reported. To identify factors which can predict pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure at the early course of the disease, we evaluated MERS-CoV infected patients managed in a tertiary care center during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea.",

As it is still unclear whether initially asymptomatic patients would develop pneumonia or not,17 we included all the MERS-CoV infected patients managed at our hospital during the outbreak regardless of symptoms presence. To avoid confusion with the case definition of MERS which did not included asymptomatic cases,18 we used the term of \u2018MERS-CoV infected patient\u2019 rather than \u2018MERS patients\u2019 throughout the present paper. MERS-CoV infections were confirmed on the basis of rRT-PCR assays targeting upstream of the E gene and the open-reading frame gene 1a.18, 19 Disease status of included patients was assessed at six weeks from their symptom onset and patients were divided into three groups depending on pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure: patients without the development of pneumonia (group 1), patients who developed pneumonia without respiratory failure (group 2), and pneumonia patients who progressed to respiratory failure (group 3). For practical purposes, respiratory failure was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). The institutional review board of our hospital approved the present study.",

During the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak, fever was defined as body temperature \u226537.5 \u00b0C to increase sensitivity of screening and the same definition was used in the present analysis.9 Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count lower than 150 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, lymphopenia as an absolute lymphocyte count lower than 1,000 cells/mm3, and hypoalbuminemia as albumin concentration lower than 3.5 g/dL. Lower respiratory tract specimens including sputum and endotracheal aspirates were used for MERS-CoV rRT-PCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR were used as a surrogate of viral load. Pneumonia development of MERS-CoV infected patient was defined as presence of parenchymal infiltration on chest X-ray with respiratory symptoms. Test days or events were counted from the day of symptom onset for each patient: day 1 was defined as the day of symptom onset. For asymptomatic patients, the day of diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was considered as day 1.",

For factors for respiratory failure, patients who progressed to respiratory failure (group 3) were compared to those who did not (group 1 and 2). Student's t-tests or Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were used to compare continuous variables, and chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Statistically significant continuous variables were re-categorized into binary factors using threshold values between mean of each group, which showed lowest P value. Statistically significant categorical variables and binary factors re-categorized from continuous variables were defined as predictive factors. For significant predictive factors, as a measure of association, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for OR were calculated using the Woolf procedure.20 Multivariate analysis was not performed due to the limited sample size. All P-values were two-tailed, and those <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.",

Compared to MERS outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula where community-acquired infections might simultaneously occur from animals, identifying epidemiologic links, exposure date, and symptom onset were relatively clear for each case.5, 19 In our observation, the clinical course of symptomatic MERS patients progressed serially and no one developed pneumonia before day 4 of symptom onset. This is the reason why we used clinical data obtained by day 3 of symptom onset. There is no other comparable data to which presented time interval from the symptom onset to the development of pneumonia. Although there were no ideal cut-off scores of predictive factors with good sensitivity and specificity, it should be noted that 100% of patients with \u2265 two predictive factors for pneumonia actually progressed to pneumonia. Thus, careful and intensive management should be implemented for such patients including adequate isolation of patient in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), minimizing chance for exposure, application of PPE with hooded coverall, and consideration of experimental antiviral treatment.9, 21, 22, 23, 24 For patients with \u2265 two predictive factors for respiratory failure, AIIRs in intensive care units should be prepared for early elective intubation. Although the time interval from symptom onset to MV support was much longer than in previous reports (median 12 days versus 7 days),1 we also experienced rapid progression of pneumonia from the moment of desaturation: 73% of group 3 patients required MV within 2 days from desaturation (median 2, IQR 1\u20133 days). To avoid urgent situations which might break protection of healthcare workers, elective intubation should be considered when desaturation begins to progress. In addition, sensitivities of predictive values are relatively low with cut-off value of \u2265 two factors, clinical course of patients with any predictive factors also should be carefully monitored.",

            "text": "Although other predictive factors for pneumonia development and respiratory failure were different due to discordance of statistical significance, they shared the same spectrum of etiology. Age increased according to pneumonia progression and was associated with both pneumonia and respiratory failure as a continuous variable (P = 0.015 and P = 0.036, respectively). These findings correlate with previous data suggesting that old age is associated with poor prognosis.11, 13, 14, 15, 34, 35 Similarly, the proportion of males increased according to disease severity, though male sex was only significant for predicting respiratory failure. Although the mean age of males was older than that of females (49.7 and 42.6 years, respectively), it was not statistically significant (P = 0.169). Previous data also reported that overall proportion of male was higher and was associated with severe infection.15, 34 It could be meaningful observation that the same finding was observed in the Republic of Korea where the social activity of females is not restricted, especially among healthcare workers. On the other hand, hypoalbuminemia and hypertension were predictive factors only for respiratory failure, while high viral load was predictive factor for the development of pneumonia. These factors were related with severe disease and poor prognosis of MERS in previous reports.1, 12, 13, 15, 16, 34, 35\n",

However, as all electronic medical records were standardized to record symptoms and signs in the same way from the beginning of the outbreak, bias was minimized. Secondly, there were missing values when calculating the sensitivity and specificity of predictive factors, which is another limitation of retrospective study. Lastly, the present study did not perform multivariate analysis due to limited sample size and need to be validated. Prospective studies with sufficient number of patients are required for validation of the predictive factors identified in the present study. Despite these limitations, our data would be suitable for identifying predictive factors because we could observe entire course of the disease from exposure and apply homogenous management to patients.",
