DAH is recognized by the signs of acute- or subacute-onset cough, hemoptysis, diffuse radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. This clinicopathologic syndrome is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells (RBCs) originating most often from the alveolar capillaries and, less frequently, from precapillary arterioles or postcapillary venules [2]. DAH must be distinguished from localized pulmonary hemorrhage, which is most commonly due to chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tumor, or localized infection [3, 4].",

However, such treatment is potentially harmful when DAH is due to nonimmune causes such as infection [6]. In immunocompetent patients, pulmonary infections are rarely reported in association with DAH, but they should be considered in the diagnostic workup because of the obvious therapeutic implications [7]. This review presents the infectious diseases that most frequently cause DAH in immunocompetent patients [influenza A (H1N1), dengue, leptospirosis, malaria, and Staphylococcus aureus infection] and summarizes the clinical, pathologic, and imaging features of DAH in infectious diseases. We focus on the primary diseases that cause DAH according to the number of cases described in the literature, determined using the PubMed and Scopus databases.",

Some patients present with severe acute respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation [1, 4]. DAH may present with a course of variable severity and should always be considered an imminently life-threatening condition. DAH is associated with several clinical entities and histologic subtypes. Its pathophysiology is alveolar microcirculation injury, and the cause might be generalized (as in systemic vasculitis) or lung-specific disease [as in diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) or infection] [17, 18].",

Most patients presenting for care have a typical influenza-like illness with fever and cough, sometimes accompanied by sore throat, rhinorrhea, and other common systemic viral symptoms [23]. Signs and symptoms such as dyspnea (or tachypnea in children), chest pain, hemoptysis or purulent sputum, altered mental status, and manifestations of dehydration indicate progression to more severe disease or complications [24]. Underlying conditions associated with complications from seasonal influenza are also risk factors for complications from influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. Pregnant women, those less than 2 weeks postpartum, and patients with immunosuppression or neurologic disorders have also been overrepresented among those with severe influenza A (H1N1) infection [24]. Several other risk factors for severe or fatal cases of this infection, particularly in patients younger than 5 years and older than 65 years, include severe obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, metabolic disorders, chronic renal or hepatic disease, immunosuppression, hemoglobinopathy, a long history of smoking, and long-term aspirin therapy [25]. Several laboratory diagnostic tests can be used to detect the presence of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including direct antigen detection tests, virus isolation in cell culture, and detection of influenza-specific RNA by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). RT-PCR has the highest sensitivity and specificity; rapid antigen and immunofluorescence tests, albeit very useful as initial screening tests, are considerably less sensitive [26].",

Although DAH has been reported in other influenza epidemics [32], in this review we discuss only influenza A (H1N1), which is the viral serotype of influenza currently considered to be related most closely to DAH. Gilbert et al. [30] suspected that severe cases of influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia had a higher incidence of alveolar hemorrhage than previously reported. This suspicion was supported by Mauad et al. [21], who found an intense hemorrhagic component in 5/21 autopsied patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection. These histopathologic features were also reported by other authors, who noted the frequent association of alveolar hemorrhage with DAD in influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia [33\u201335]. Some other case reports related DAH to influenza A (H1N1) infection, in which HRCT scans showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities [7, 36]. A retrospective chart analysis of 15 fatal cases of influenza A (H1N1) showed that 80 % had intra-alveolar hemorrhage; the most common radiologic findings were fluffy infiltrates, followed by confluent opacities [33].\n",

Moderate to marked thrombocytopenia with concurrent hemoconcentration is a hallmark of clinical laboratory findings in DHF [40]. In general, other laboratory findings include neutropenia followed by lymphocytosis, with the presence of atypical lymphocytes [37\u201340]. The diagnosis is based on serology, RNA detection, and viral isolation in blood specimens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays remain the most widely used technique for serologic diagnosis, but they do not identify the dengue virus serotype responsible for the current infection [8].",

It is thought to be a multifactorial process with abnormalities in the coagulation cascade, thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and vascular defects. Increased vascular permeability has been thought to be mediated by histamine release [41, 42]. A histopathologic review of 319 adult patients with dengue showed that pulmonary hemorrhage and DAD were the main features of the infection [43]. Morphologic studies of lung tissues revealed interstitial pneumonia associated with focal or diffuse zones of alveolar congestion and hemorrhage, an increased number of alveolar macrophages, and recruiting of platelets, mononuclear cells, and polymorphonuclear cells [44, 45]. DAH in DHF has been rarely described [41, 42]. HRCT findings in DHF causing DAH may present discrete patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs [41]. Other features are extensive and bilateral areas of consolidation with air bronchogram and ground-glass opacities associated with small pleural effusions [8].\n",

Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis range from asymptomatic or febrile episodes to severe forms. The clinical findings include fever, muscle tenderness (especially of the calf muscles), headache, conjunctival suffusion, and digestive disorders, with hepatic and renal involvement. Mental status disturbance may also appear [47]. Leptospirosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with febrile illnesses associated with pneumonitis and respiratory failure, especially when hemoptysis is present [48].",

The most frequent HRCT findings are extensive, bilateral, ground-glass opacities involving all lobes (Fig. 3). Areas of consolidation, peripheral airspace nodules, and pleural effusions may be present. The abnormalities involve mainly the peripheral and dorsal lung regions and the lower lung zones [48, 53]. Microscopic examination reveals extensive areas of intra-alveolar and interstitial hemorrhage, but other findings, such as pulmonary edema, fibrin deposition, hyaline membrane formation, and proliferative fibroblastic reactions, are frequent [49].\n",

These data indicate that innate immune receptors and adhesion molecules contribute to the pathogenesis of lung hemorrhage in leptospirosis. Croda et al. [55] suggested that the linear deposition of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM) and complements on the alveolar surface may play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hemorrhage in human leptospirosis. Thus, leptospirosis pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome seems to have unique pathologic features not seen in other pulmonary hemorrhagic syndromes. These results are important because no treatment other than supportive respiratory care is currently available for this syndrome. A better understanding of the pathogenesis can contribute to the development of treatment strategies for this devastating manifestation of leptospirosis [54, 55].",

Pulmonary symptoms such as cough with or without expectoration and dyspnea have been described in patients with malaria [60, 61]. The clinical manifestations of malaria have shown a paradigm shift in the last two decades; multiorgan failure is encountered much more frequently than previously, likely due to the high transmission rate of falciparum malaria and drug resistance to commonly used antimalarial agents [62]. In patients living or having traveled in endemic areas, malaria should be considered as a possible cause of ARDS of obscure etiology. ARDS is increasingly reported in falciparum malaria and malaria caused by species formerly considered benign (Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae) [60].

In patients with falciparum malaria, ARDS can develop at the time of initial presentation or after several days of treatment, when patients appear to be improving and parasitemia is reduced [60, 61]. Pregnant women with severe falciparum malaria are particularly prone to the development of ARDS and have a high rate of mortality [61]. Adequate supportive management is considered to be an essential component of treatment to reduce mortality in patients with severe complicated malaria, and the early administration of specific antimalarial treatment can be lifesaving [60\u201362].",

Staphylococcus aureus is estimated to cause 1\u201310 % of community-acquired pneumonias and 20\u201350 % of nosocomial pneumonias [68]. Pneumonia often occurs after influenza infection, particularly in elderly patients with preexisting chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular diseases. It has an abrupt clinical scenario, with pleural chest pain, cough, purulent sputum, and sometimes hemoptysis. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is well known as a cause of hospital-acquired infections, and the frequency of community-onset MRSA (CO-MRSA) infections has increased substantially in the past decade [69]. Methicillin resistance is determined by the presence of a penicillin-binding protein with decreased affinity to penicillin [56]. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA may produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and cause necrotic hemorrhagic pneumonia, but the majority of publications have been related to CO-MRSA or mixed patient groups [70, 71]. Whether methicillin resistance plays a role in the pathogenesis of CO-MRSA has not been well established. One study compared outcomes between MSSA and MRSA strains and found no significant difference. Mortality rates are not higher among patients with MRSA-related PVL-positive pneumonia than among those with MSSA-related PVL-positive pneumonia [71].",

In one series, hemoptysis was found in 6/16 (38 %) patients with severe pneumonia associated with S. aureus strains carrying PVL genes compared with 1/33 (3 %) PVL-negative patients [70]. Lina et al. [75] screened 23 cases of CO-MRSA pneumonia with PVL genes; 14 (61 %) of these cases were fatal, and autopsies revealed diffuse, bilateral necrotic hemorrhagic pneumonia. Moreover, Francis et al. [69] reported four cases of severe necrotizing MRSA pneumonia in previously healthy patients, which presented as an influenza or influenza-like prodrome. Two of the patients had evidence of concomitant influenza A infection. The association between influenza and severe staphylococcal pneumonia is well recognized [69]. In a cohort of 112 patients with criteria for DAH, the most infectious cause was S. aureus, which was present in five cases, including two methicillin-resistant and three PVL-producing strains [6].",

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) has a high case-fatality rate and characteristically presents as respiratory distress from noncardiogenic edema, although alveolar hemorrhage may be present [83, 84]. The pathogenesis of HPS is believed to be related to the immune response to the virus, which is responsible for increased capillary permeability leading to pulmonary edema. Although the virus antigen is present in microvascular endothelial cells, the disturbance is basically functional and no alveolar damage occurs in most patients [85]. Based on clinical suspicion and epidemiologic history, the etiologic diagnosis is made by serologic tests and detection of the viral genome by RT-PCR [85].",
