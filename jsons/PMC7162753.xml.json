A global crash in demand from hotels and restaurants has seen prices of agricultural commodities drop by 20%. (8) Countries around the world have imposed a number of protective measures to contain the exponentially increasing spread. This includes social distancing, avoiding unnecessary travel, and a ban on congregations. Advice on self-isolation upon contact with suspected carriers of the virus is likely to impact the number of available inspectors and delivery staff critical to ensuring verification and transportation of products. This will have pronounced implications for perishable goods such as meat and vegetables. Furthermore, markets have gone a step further by shutting down floor trading which has impacted the ability of commodity exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a recent example. (9) \u2018Panic buying\u2019 is further complicating shortages beyond supermarket shelves. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) have expressed concern over low levels of animal pharmaceuticals for several large drug suppliers. (10)",

However, savings on petrol are unlikely to be redirected into more spending as populations are instructed to practise social distancing and the working class are uncertain about job security. Furthermore, any increase to consumer activity is likely to be outweighed by damage caused to populations reliant on revenue from other forms of energy such as Shale gas.

(16) Importation issues and staffing deficiencies stood out as the key concerns for businesses due to disruption to supply chains and self-isolation policies. Indeed, for many roles within a manufacturing company, \u2018working from home\u2019 is not a viable option. As the UK is adopting similar protective measures to the rest of the world, and due to the global overlap of supply chains, we can expect these anxieties to transcend borders. The Chemical Industry is predicted to reduce its global production by 1.2% -- the worst growth for the sector since the 2008 financial crash.

A study by the Brookings Institution (23) modelling closures in major US cities and nationwide suggest that there would be a median cost of $142 per student per week. This then leads to an estimate that a four-week closure of New York City would lead to an economic impact of $1.1 billion and that a nationwide closure for 12 weeks would cost 1% of GDP. Furthermore, this study looks at the direct impact of closures on the children of healthcare workers with an estimated 6-19% of healthcare workforce hours lost. An estimate in the UK suggested that protracted closures could cost 3% of UK GDP (24).
