However, a concise scoring method has only been proposed for pediatric patients, and not for adult patients yet. Here, we developed and validated a concise scoring method using data on patients admitted to ICUs in 21 Japanese hospitals from 2012 to 2014. We randomly assigned to either discovery or validation cohorts, identified the factors significantly associated with persistent AKI using a multivariable logistic regression model in the discovery cohort to establish a scoring system, and assessed the validity of the scoring in the validation cohort using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the calibration slope. Among 8,320 patients admitted to the ICUs, persistent AKI was present in 1,064 (12.8%) patients. In the discovery cohort (n = 4,151), 'hyperbilirubinemia', 'sepsis' and 'ventilator and/or vasoactive' with small changes in serum creatinine were selected to establish the scoring. In the validation cohort (n = 4,169), the predicting model based on this scoring had a c-statistic of 0.79 (95%CI, 0.77-0.81) and was well calibrated. In conclusion, we established a concise scoring method to identify potential patients with persistent AKI, which performed well in the validation cohort.",

Therefore, early detection and intervention for patients at high risk of persistent AKI is crucial for preventing adverse consequences.

            "text": "In this study, we use the term \"persistent AKI risk index (PARI)\" instead of RAI. PARI is a composite of risk factors and clinical signs of AKI. The rationale for the PARI is that patients who have risk factors at differing risk levels for AKI can be identified as high risk for persistent AKI by meeting the differing criteria on clinical signs of AKI, such as small changes in serum creatinine 8 . If a patient has higher risk factors, they require less clinical signs of AKI (very small changes in serum creatinine) early on in order to fulfill renal angina. Similarly, if a patient has fewer risk factors but shows more overt signs of clinical AKI (moderate changes in serum creatinine), renal angina would also be fulfilled. Per the epidemiology of AKI, the risk of AKI increases in a multiplicative fashion with increased risk factors. The incidence of AKI demonstrates fold-increases for higher-risk patients. Thus, just like the previous study 10 , the PARI was calculated by a multiplicative index based on a change in serum creatinine (namely, the creatinine component) and patient conditions (namely, condition component) in reference to the RAI for pediatric ICU patients. The creatinine component was determined based on a univariable logistic regression analysis in the association of the difference in serum creatinine values (\u0394Cr) between ICU days 0 and 1, and persistent AKI. We selected \u0394Cr between ICU days 0 and 1 because this timeframe was felt to be beyond the generally accepted window in the clinical practice, allowing time for fluid resuscitation, optimizing hemodynamics, and appropriate treatment such as antibiotics against infection. The condition component was determined based on a multivariable logistic regression analysis including the following risk factors: older age, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, morbid obesity, hyperbilirubinemia, cerebrovascular accident, cancer, high-risk surgery, nephrotoxic drugs, sepsis, and ventilator or vasoactive. We selected these candidate variables according to the previous study 14, 15 . Age, CKD, morbid obesity and hyperbilirubinemia were diagnosed based on patients' medical charts including Figure 1 . Study Design The PARI was calculated the day after ICU admission based on each patient's condition at admission to the ICU and the slight changes in serum creatinine (\u0394Cr) levels between ICU admission and the following day. The primary outcome measure was KDIGO AKI stage 2/3 persisting over three days, and the secondary outcome measures were RRT and death within one week.",

Persistent AKI is associated with a poor prognosis. However, as mentioned earlier, there are no effective treatments for preventing AKI. Early identification of persistent AKI is important to initiate an extended evaluation and management protocol in order to avoid further kidney damage. The Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup also recommends that the presence of persistent AKI should prompt a re-assessment of the possible causes of AKI and the reconsideration of treatment options. However, a clinical score for detecting the potential risk of persistent AKI has not been validated so far. The PARI can be expected to detect the potential population of patients at high risk of persistent AKI. We would like to propose that PARI is used with AKI biomarkers to stratify the risk of AKI for all adult ICU patients. The risk assessment by combining PARI and biomarkers can provide real-time clinical decision support with respect to fluid management, nephrotoxic medication avoidance, and more confidence in escalating care to include renal replacement therapy, as written in the previous paper 22 if patients have low PARI score, you provide standard ICU care to them. If a patient has high PARI score, you measure urinary biomarker and assess the risk of persistent AKI. According to the value of urinary biomarker and urine output, physicians can decide to closely monitor fluid balance, stabilize hemodynamics and provide renal replacement therapy. Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, this is a retrospective study and it may, therefore, suffer from the inherent bias common to all retrospective studies. Although we conducted this study in multiple centers (the ICUs of 21 private hospitals in Japan), the study participants may not be representative of the general ICU population. The PARI established in our cohort may need to be validated in other Japanese hospitals and ICUs in other countries, although we believe that the concept of establishing the PARI can be applied in various other ICU settings.",

Therefore, the inclusion of urine output may make it sensitive to detect the risk for AKI and improve the PPV of the PARI to stratify the risk for AKI.
