Metaplastic squamous or cuboidal epithelium may overly the bronchiolar fibrosis. Sometimes, only a slit-like lumen of the airway may remain as a result of a confluent submucosal scar or intraluminal polyps of scar tissue. There may be rather prominent capillaries supplying the intraluminal fibrotic areas. Ultimately, the bronchiolar lumen might be entirely occluded by dense scar tissue (Fig. 13.7c, d) . In these cases, only an elastic stain highlighting residual elastic tissue, the vicinity of the scar to a pulmonary artery, and residual smooth muscle may indicate that a small airway has been replaced by fibrotic scar.

Although the optimal treatment of AMR in the lung is currently not known due to the lack of clinical trials, treatment is typically comprised of plasmapheresis, possibly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and medications such as rituximab and bortezomib, among others. As such, the associated histopathologic and clinical parameters are the subject of intense investigation. Deposition of complement 4d (C4d), a complement split product, on the capillary endothelium has been suggested as a surrogate marker for AMR in heart, kidney, and pancreas transplants [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . However, the role of C4d deposition in the diagnosis of AMR in lung allografts is still unclear. Moreover, reproducibility of C4d deposition in allograft lung TBBx is problematic, even among pathologists who routinely evaluate C4d in lung allograft biopsies [72] . Furthermore, there are currently no specific or sensitive morphologic features of AMR in lung allografts, although some features that are more commonly identified in these patients have emerged in some recent studies [73] . Studies have attempted to evaluate immunoglobulins (Ig) and complement deposits in the subendothelial space.

However, except for C4d and in some institutions C3d, these studies have in general not been implemented for the workup of lung transplant biopsies for possible AMR. One of the reasons for the difficulties in lung is the relatively high background that is encountered in immunohistochemical as well as immunofluorescence studies. Often, C4d binds to the vascular elastic lamina or shows other non-specific binding such as intracapillary serum. Staining is commonly only focal, and, therefore, sensitivity and specificity have not been established. Only linear, continuous luminal endothelial staining of capillaries, arterioles, and/or venules by C4d should be interpreted as positive.

The study demonstrated that biopsies from patients with DSA more commonly showed morphologic features of acute lung injury with or without diffuse alveolar damage than biopsies from patients with non-DSA or no circulating antibodies. Endotheliitis was more common in patients with DSA than patients without circulating antibodies. However, there was no difference in occurrence of endotheliitis between biopsies from patients with circulating non-DSA vs DSA or non-DSA vs no circulating antibodies. Specimens associated with DSA had a significant higher frequency of capillary inflammation, including neutrophilic margination, increased neutrophils, or capillaritis with karyorrhexis than patients with non-DSA or no circulating antibodies. C4d staining was positive in less than 50% of capillaries in 14% of biopsies and in more than 50% of capillaries in 7% of biopsies.
