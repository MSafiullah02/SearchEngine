[3] [4] [5] One specific source of variability in discharge readiness and LOS variability may be the lack of consensus about safe threshold oxygen saturation values for discharge in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. 6, 7 In 2006, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Net-work recommended a discharge room air oxygen (RAO2) saturation threshold of 95%. 8 The same year, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) bronchiolitis clinical practice guideline stated that oxygen is not needed for children with RAO2 saturations 90% who are feeding well and have minimal respiratory distress. 9 There is a need for prospective studies to help clinicians make evidenced-based discharge decisions for this common condition.",

The number of participating sites varied over the 3 years: 13 in year 1, 16 in year 2, and 14 in year 3. Each month from November 1 until March 31, site investigators across 12 US states used a standardized protocol to enroll a target number of consecutive patients from the inpatient wards and the intensive care unit (ICU). We aimed to enroll 20% of our total sample from the ICU. To over sample children in the ICU, the ward and ICU enrollments were separate. Once the site reached their target enrollment for that month, the investigators would stop enrollment until the beginning of the following month.",

Pulse was categorized as low, normal, or high based on age-related heart rate values. 13 Presence of apnea was recorded daily by site investigators. 14 Nasopharyngeal Aspirate Collection and Virology Testing As described previously, site teams used a standardized protocol to collect nasopharyngeal aspirates, 11 which were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B; rhinovirus (RV); parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; influenza virus types A and B; 2009 novel H1N1; human metapneumovirus; coronaviruses NL-63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E; enterovirus, and adenovirus using polymerase chain reaction. 11, [15] [16] [17] Defining Clinical Improvement and Worsening Clinical improvement criteria were based on the 2006 AAP guidelines. 9 For respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, clinicians estimated average daily respiratory rate and oxygen saturation based on the recorded readings from the previous 24 hours. This estimation reflects the process clinicians use when rounding on their hospitalized patients, and thus may be more similar to standard clinical practice than a calculated mean. The respiratory rate criteria are adjusted for age. 18, 19 For daily estimated average oxygen saturation we used the AAP criteria of RAO2 saturation of 90%. Considering that oxygen saturation is the main determinant of LOS, 20 healthy infants age <6 months may have transient oxygen saturations of around 80%, 21 and that errors in estimation may occur, we included a lowest RAO2 of 88% in our improvement criteria. By combining the dichotomized estimated oxygen saturation (90% or not) with the lower limit of 88%, there was little room for erroneous conclusions. A child was considered clinically improved on the earliest date he/she met all of the following criteria: (1) none or mild retractions and improved or stable retractions compared with the previous inpatient day; (2) daily estimated average respiratory rate (RR) <60 breaths per minute for age <6 months, <55 breaths/minute for age 6 to 11 months, and <45 breaths/minute for age 12 months with a decreasing or stable trend over the course of the current day; (3) daily estimated average RAO2 saturation 90%, lowest RAO2 saturation 88% 21 ; and (4) not receiving intravenous (IV) fluids or for children receiving IV fluids a clinician report of the child maintaining oral hydration. Children who reached the clinical improvement criteria were considered clinically worse if they required intensive care or had the inverse of 1 of the improvement criteria: moderate/severe retractions that were worse compared with the previous inpatient day, daily average RR 60 with an increasing trend over the current day, need for oxygen, or need for IV fluids.",

The frequency of clinical worsening after reaching the improvement criteria was stable when we examined different RA02 criteria in sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding RA02 as a criterion for improvement: 90% met improvement criteria and 4% experienced clinical worsening, (2) changing the average RA02 threshold for clinical improvement to 94%: 62% met improvement criteria and 6% experienced clinical worsening, and (3) changing the average RA02 threshold for clinical improvement to 95%: 47% met improvement criteria and 5% experienced clinical worsening.

Nonetheless, 96% of children continued to improve once they had: (1) improving or stable retractions rated as none/mild, (2) a decreasing or stable RR by age, (3) estimated average RAO2 saturation 90% and lowest RAO2 saturation of 88%, and (4) were hydrated. The 4% of children who worsened after clinically improving were more likely to be age <2 months, born <37 weeks, and present with more severe distress (ie, severe retractions, inadequate oral intake, or apnea). Based on the low risk of worsening after clinical improvement, especially among children admitted to the regular ward (2%), we believe these 4 clinical criteria could be used as discharge criteria for this common pediatric illness with a predominantly monophasic clinical course. Variability in hospital LOS for children with bronchiolitis exists in the United States 3 and internationally. 4,5 Cheung and colleagues analyzed administrative data from over 75,000 children admitted for bronchiolitis in England between April 2007 and March 2010 and found sixfold variation in LOS between sites. They concluded that this LOS variability was due in part to providers' clinical decision making. 5 Srivastava and colleagues 23 addressed variable clinician decision making in bronchiolitis and 10 other common pediatric conditions by embedding discharge criteria developed by expert consensus into admission order sets. They found that for children with bronchiolitis, the embedded discharge criteria reduced the median LOS from 1.91 to 1.87 days. In contrast to the single-center data presented by White and colleagues, 24 the prospective, multicenter MARC-30 data provide a clear understanding of the normal clinical course for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, determine if children clinically worsen after clinical improvement, and provide data about discharge criteria for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Although there is a lack of rigorous published data, the lower tract symptoms of bronchiolitis (eg, cough, retractions) are said to peak on days 5 to 7 of illness and then gradually resolve. 25 In the present study, we found that the time from the onset of difficulty breathing until hospital admission is less variable than the time from the onset of difficulty breathing until either clinical improvement or discharge. Although 75% of children have clinically improved within 7.5 days of difficulty breathing based on the IQR results, the remaining 25% may have a more prolonged recovery in the hospital of up to 3 weeks. Interestingly, prolonged recovery times from bronchiolitis have also been noted in children presenting to the ED 26 and in an outpatient population. 27 It is unclear why 20% to 25% of children at different levels of severity of illness have prolonged recovery from bronchiolitis, but this group of children requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Given the variability of recovery times, clinicians may have difficulty knowing when a child is ready for hospital discharge. One of the main stumbling blocks for discharge readiness in children with bronchiolitis is the interpretation of the oxygen saturation value. 6, 8, 9, 20, 28 However, it should be considered that interpreting the oxygen saturation in a child who is clinically improving in the hospital setting is different than interpreting the oxygen saturation of a child in the ED or the clinic whose clinical course is less certain. 22 In the hospital setting, using the oxygen saturation value in in the AAP guideline, 9 4% of children clinically worsened after they met the improvement criteria, a clinical pattern observed previously with supplemental oxygen. 28 This unpredictability may explain some of the variation in providers' clinical decision making. 5 The children who worsened, and therefore deserve more cautious discharge planning, were young (<2 months), premature (<37 weeks gestational age), and presented in more severe distress. Those children admitted to the ICU from the ED worsened more commonly than children admitted to the ward (19% vs 2%). Interestingly, the viral etiology of the child's bronchiolitis did not influence whether a child worsened after reaching the improvement criteria. Therefore, although children with RV bronchiolitis have a shorter hospital LOS than children with RSV bronchiolitis, 11 the pattern of recovery did not differ by viral etiology. In addition to unsafe discharges, clinicians may be concerned about the possibility of readmissions. Although somewhat controversial, hospital readmission is being used as a quality of care metric. [29] [30] [31] One response to minimize readmissions would be for clinicians to observe children for longer than clinically indicated. 32 However, shorter LOS is not necessarily associated with increased readmission rates. 33 Given that the geometric mean of hospital charges per child with bronchiolitis increased from $6380 in 2000 to $8530 in 2009, 34 the potential for safely reducing hospital LOS by using the discharge criteria proposed in the current study instead of other criteria 8 may net substantial cost savings. Furthermore, reducing LOS would decrease the time children expose others to these respiratory viruses and possibly reduce medical errors. 35 Our study has some potential limitations. Because the study participants were all hospitalized, these data do not inform admission or discharge decisions from either the ED or the clinic; but other data address those clinical scenarios. 22 Also, the 16 sites that participated in this study were large, urban teaching hospitals. Consequently, these results are not necessarily generalizable to smaller community hospitals. Although numerous data points were required to enter the analytic cohort, only 9% of the sample was excluded for missing data. There were 214 children who did not meet our improvement criteria by the time of discharge. Although the inability to include these children in the analysis may be seen as a limitation, this practice variability underscores the need for more data about discharging hospitalized children with bronchiolitis. Last, site teams reviewed medical records daily. More frequent recording of the clinical course would have yielded more granular data, but the current methodology replicates how data are generally presented during patient care rounds, when decisions about suitability for discharge are often considered.",
