Two single-center studies, of 125 patients [4] and 338 patients [5] found a higher likelihood of diabetes among patients who deteriorated. Other than diabetes, most of the factors identified in the literature for deterioration were inconsistent with our patient. A lymphocyte count below 1500 microliters has been identified as a factor but was normal in our patient [6] . One multicenter study of 78 admitted patients with COVID-19 pneumonia found that the 14% who deteriorated were older, more likely to be a smoker and were equally likely to have diabetes compared to those who deteriorated [7] . Two of the aforementioned studies [5, 7] also noted elevated temperature at admission to be associated with deterioration; while our patient had a history of subjective fevers, his temperature on presentation was normal. Older age was found to be a risk factor for ARDS and death in a single-center study of 201 patients [8] . A possible association between Chest CT findings and severe COVID-19, suggested in a study of 104 patients aboard the \"Diamond Princess\" cruise [9] , is discussed below. CXR has not demonstrated the ability to predict severity of illness in COVID-19. Radiologic findings may not be appreciably different from community acquired pneumonia where CT-only pneumonia has the same disease severity and outcomes as cases where signs of pneumonia are visible on chest radiograph [10] .",

Later in the disease process the findings can become denser with areas of subpleural sparing. The initial reporting literature perhaps overemphasized the importance of imaging, in particular chest CT, in the detection of COVID-19. In clinical practice, the utility of imaging is limited given the lack of sensitivity and specificity of chest CT as a diagnostic test. In fact, many of the radiologic societies have come out with statements stating that imaging (CT and X-ray) have a limited role in the workup and management of these patients. Imaging should be reserved to evaluate for complications.",
