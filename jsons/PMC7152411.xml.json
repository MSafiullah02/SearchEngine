In the prospective study, we also excluded patients receiving heavy sedation or analgesics and those receiving skeletal muscle relaxants. For this study, using an arbitrary set of bedside criteria, we classified patients as nonencephalopathic, mildly encephalopathic, and severely encephalopathic. In our classification, nonencephalopathic patients cooperated with testing and passed a series of tests of attention, concentration, orientation, and short-term memory. The mildly encephalopathic patients completed testing but failed to \u201cpass,\u201d and the severely encephalopathic patients were too obtunded to test.",

Delirium occurs infrequently, preceding stupor or coma. Mildly encephalopathic patients often show considerable fluctuation in their clinical state, and older individuals become especially confused at night. Attention, concentration, and memory are impaired. Writing disturbances occur, as in other acute confusional states. Paratonic rigidity, or gegenhalten (a rate-dependent resistance to passive movement), is almost universal in encephalopathic patients. Tremor, asterixis, and multifocal myoclonus occur in 10 to 25 percent of noncomatose encephalopathic patients. Alterations of pupillary size or reaction, abnormalities of individual cranial nerves, focal neurological signs, or convulsive seizures typically do not occur. Hemiparesis or gaze palsy was found in 6 and focal or generalized convulsive seizures occurred in 5 of the 12 patients in our retrospective (autopsy) series, but were rare in our prospective study.

We found it to be more sensitive than our arbitrary clinical assessment of mental status, in that some nonencephalopathic patients had mild EEG abnormalities that resolved on subsequent recordings. The mildest EEG change consisted of mild, generalized slowing (theta activity). More severe EEG abnormalities, which correlated with more profound depression of consciousness, consisted of greater slowing (delta activity), triphasic waves, or a burst-suppression pattern (Fig. 52-2\n).13 Using computational nonlinear analysis techniques, Straver and colleagues showed that EEG features correlated with the severity of illness and that the EEG became disorganized with greater severity of illness, suggesting a shift in the processing ability of the brain.14 Although there is a direct relationship between the degree of EEG abnormality and mortality, some patients with even the most severe categories of abnormality recover. Thus, the EEG cannot be used to predict a hopeless prognosis in septic encephalopathy.13, 14\n",

Tumor necrosis factor\u2013alpha and interferon-gamma increase the permeability of cerebral endothelial cells.18, 19 It has also been shown that the perivascular end-feet of astrocytes are disrupted in pigs with fecal peritonitis injected with endotoxin.20 Alterations in the adrenergic system may also play a role: the \u03b22-adenoreceptor agonist dopexamine inhibits brain edema in animal models of sepsis, while the \u03b11-adenoreceptor blocker methoxamine prevents it. The combined effect increases tissue edema and alters the chemical milieu of the interstitial fluid of the brain. Cytokines themselves may directly affect brain function. Again, their access to the brain may be facilitated by alterations in blood\u2013brain barrier function. When directly injected into the brain or ventricles of animals, interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 alter behavior and EEG frequencies.21 Interleukin-1 facilitates sleep and induces fever by its effects on the hypothalamus. Some of these effects relate to activation of opiate receptors in the brain; the possibility of effects on other peptide systems in the brain remains to be explored. Proinflammatory cytokines may also activate STAT 3, a transcription molecule, in astrocytes.22 The significance of this is not clear, but astrocytes play a key role in maintaining a homeostatic environment for CNS neurons. Lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma, upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) in astrocytes.23 This leads to the production of reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide and superoxide, causing oxidative stress for astrocytes and neurons of the brain.",

These include drugs as well as the relative amounts of certain endogenous substances. The latter include higher ratios of aromatic to branched-chain amino acids (increased in the plasma because of altered metabolism in liver and muscle) and increased exposure to other peptides and hormones. Such changes play a role in the documented alteration of certain putative neurotransmitters in sepsis, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Additional neurotransmitter alterations include increased serotonin turnover and decreased noradrenergic transmission in the brain in sepsis.24 A similar derangement in neurotransmitter balance occurs in hepatic and uremic encephalopathy. Astrocytic dysfunction, mentioned earlier, contributes to increases in extracellular glutamate, an excitotoxic neurotransmitter that can cause neuronal death or seizures through activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.25\n",

Tendon reflexes that were previously present cannot be elicited. By contrast, head, face, and jaw movements are relatively preserved. In two of our patients, this absence of movement in the extremities but preservation of movement of the head had erroneously been diagnosed as resulting from high cervical spinal cord disease. Patients with lesser degrees of polyneuropathy show more equivocal signs, with variably weak muscles, particularly distally, and reduced or absent tendon reflexes, notably at the ankles.

We speculate41 that the primary axonal damage may be due to involvement of axonal transport systems, which are known to be energy-dependent; this fact may explain why predominantly distal nerve segments are involved. Moreover, it is known that the blood\u2013nerve barrier, in contrast to the blood\u2013brain barrier, shows increased permeability to histamine and serotonin. Several mediators of the septic syndrome are known to have histamine-like action. Circulating \u201ctoxins\u201d could potentially gain access to the endoneurial space and directly damage the axon. It is also possible that disturbance of the microcirculation, as has been postulated to occur in sepsis and multiple organ failure, is the mechanism by which these events in peripheral nerve are initiated.",
