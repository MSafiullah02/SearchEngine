When April monthly ferritin levels were measured, one of our female patients had unusually high ferritin levels of 3806ng/mL versus 531ng/mL previously. A clinical exam revealed no clinical symptoms of COVID-19, but she was tested in nasopharyngeal swab and was revealed positive.",

Interestingly, ferritin levels were elevated at diagnosis in the 5 asymptomatic patients as well as the patients with symptoms (respectively 1209\u00b11292 and 1535\u00b11280ng/mL, mean\u00b1SD). Ferritin levels remained stable or decreased very slowly during the whole period of sickness in almost all patients. Pathophysiological mechanism underlying high ferritin levels is not totally explained at this time, some authors reporting cytokine storm syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome, but in our cohort, ferritin levels were not correlated with c-reactive protein (data not shown)4\n,\n5.",
