The infection rate is substantially underestimated because a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients have not been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) since many patients, especially younger ones, have only few symptoms if any, and many patients with symptoms are not tested at all. It has been speculated that the total number of COVID-infected people is about five times higher than the official statistics. This bias must be taken into account when interpreting any COVID-19 statistics.",

Due to the changing availability of corona testing and the changing conditions that must be met in order to test a suspected case of corona in Germany, the evaluation of the devel-opment of the daily number of newly confirmed corona infections is complicated. By the 10th calendar week of 2020, 3.1% of 87,863 corona tests were positive. In calendar weeks 11, 12, and 13, these numbers were 5.9% of 127,457, 6.8% of 348,619, and 8.7% of 354,521, respectively [1] .",

A cross-sectional analysis of the number of ICU patients on April 19, 2020, revealed that overall 2889 patients were currently ICU patients with 2113 (73%) undergoing artificial ventilation. It should be noted that the DIVI registry expanded the coverage of ICU cases by connecting more and more ICUs to the registry over time.

Fig. 1a shows the age dependency of the CF for Italy, Spain, and the United States [3] . Until the age of 60 years, there is barely any CF. However, thereafter, the CF increases greatly by age. As the available data have not been simultaneously stratified by age and comorbidity, it is not yet possible to answer whether it is age per se or comorbidity associated with age that is responsible for this sharp increase in mortality from the age of 60.",

The mean number of pre-existing diseases was 2.7 (SD: 1.6). Only 0.8% had no pre-existing comorbidities, showing that comorbidities most likely play an important role [4] . Data from China show that the CF is highest among people with cardiovascular disease (13.2%), diabetes (9.2%), chronic respiratory disease (8.0%), hypertension (8.4%), and cancer (7.6%). Patients without comorbidities had a CF of 0.9%. However, neither of these percentages were age-standardized, and confounding bias by age is likely to be present [5] .",
