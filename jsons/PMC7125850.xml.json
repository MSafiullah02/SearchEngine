As part of the emerging market in tourism, Taiwan has an abundance and diversity of natural and cultural resources, offering great potential for the development of tourism. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether regime changes have broken down the stability of the long-run relationship between tourism development and real GDP in Taiwan. We empirically examine the co-movements and the causal relationships among real GDP, tourism development, and the real exchange rate in a multivariate model. To employ the unit root tests and the cointegration tests allowing for a structural break, the empirical evidence clearly shows that the causality between tourism and economic growth is bi-directional. Moreover, international and cross-strait political changes, economic shocks, and relaxing of some tourism control and policies would break down the stability of the relationship between tourism development and real GDP.",

Over the period 1960\u20132000, total tourist arrivals to Taiwan increased from 23,636 to 2,624,037. International tourism revenue of Taiwan increased from US$ 1.477 million in 1960 to US$ 3.738 billion in 2000 (see Table 1\n). Further analysis of overseas visitors by country shows that came from countries within the neighboring Asian region, which provided nearly 77% of all visitors in 2004. The top five of Taiwan's tourist-source residences in 2004 were Japan, Hong Kong, and Macau region, United States, South Korea, and Singapore.",

Furthermore, Min [42] employs a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model for measuring the impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on Taiwan's inbound demand over the period from March to July 2003.

Over the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Taiwan faced a turbulent international political relationship and world economic crises, which eroded the growth of Taiwan's tourism development. After the United States Government changed its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing on 1 January 1979, this policy prompted Taiwan to face a difficult relationship with mainland China and the international community. Only around 30 countries maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the moment. Substantial relations between Taiwan and those countries without diplomatic relations were confronted with many challenges, including foreigners applying for visas and the rights of international airlines. This severe international political situation resulted in a prolonged slowdown of Taiwan's tourism growth. The grim situation has also been aggravated by two oil price shocks, occurred respectively in 1973 and in 1979, and the change of Taiwan's exchange rate regime in 1987. Being in the presence of the circumstances, Taiwan's government relaxed some tourism controls and policies to reinvigorate the tourism industry in the stage. First, in the 1980s the government established 6 national parks and 12 national scenic areas. Furthermore, there was the lifting of travel restrictions\u2014for example, the government's institution of a 5-day visa-free entry program for 15 countries in 1994.",

As well as the above tourism polices, the rapid economic growth of the neighboring Asian counties has also fueled overseas arrivals to Taiwan.1\nThe fast economic growth rate of Taiwan has also brought more business visitors, which exceeded tourist visitors to become the first group from 1998 to 2000. Another important reason is that the policy for mainlanders visiting Taiwan experienced a gradual door opening from 1988 as there was an initial reconciliation between Taiwan and mainland China.",

Some advantages may vitalize Taiwan's tourism industry in the future. First, the opening up of Taiwan tourism to mainlanders was permitted starting from 2002, which will effectively boost tourism development. After many traditional industries moved into mainland China, tourism development has recently become a major policy in Taiwan for increasing employment and economic growth. For example, the Doubling Tourism Arrivals Policy is proposed by the government of Taiwan. This plan sets to double the number of tourists visiting Taiwan in 2008.",

In the beginning, we tested Taiwanese data for the last 50 years, which may be effected greatly by economic shocks, political incidents, or tourism policy alterations. This may yield structural changes from the data of GDP or tourism development variables, which therefore influence the result of the stationary test. Secondly, we use Johansen's [25] multivariate cointegrated method to test the cointegration relation between GDP and tourism development. Based on the multivariate cointegration model, we probe into the causality between GDP and tourism development with the weak exogeneity test. Finally, it is possible that structural breaks have occurred which might affect the result of the cointegration test. Using two kinds of Hansen [21] and Gregory and Hansen [18] structural change tests, which to our knowledge has not been previously applied in this area, we examine the cointegration relationship altogether and commented whether there is instability or not between GDP and tourism development.",

In many countries much hope for economic development is laid on tourism due to its capacity in generating employment. The development of tourism as such mostly requires investment, principally in hospitality, transportation, basic health, and recreation in order to motivate the accommodation and the stay of visitors. Finally, governments have to be active in laying out legislation and ordaining the development of tourism, so that the environment might be preserved and the future of tourism activities might be insured over time [65].",

The signs of the variables conform to the theory in the literature. This shows that tourism development contributes to economic growth, as in Durbarry [12]. At the same time, a rising real effective exchange rate can be harmful to tourism development [8]. However, the long-run tourism-elasticities are estimated to be 3.50\u20134.67. The long-run real exchange rate-elasticities are estimated to be 0.43\u20130.81. According to these estimations, income has a positive relationship with tourism and a positive link with the real exchange rate. Furthermore, the likelihood ratio test on the statistical significance of the parameters rejects the null hypothesis in all cases for the tourism variables, but does not reject the null hypothesis on the real exchange rate. In other words, comparing the effects on Taiwan's real GDP variables (LY) between the tourism variables (LTOUR1 and LTOUR2) and the real exchange rate (LRQ), the former is more significantly effective.",

Several studies investigate the tests of non-linear causality relations, such as Baek and Brock [5] and Hiemstra and Jones [22]. Baek and Brock [5] show that the linear Granger causality tests have low power against the non-linear alternatives. However, any test based on the assumption of linearity fails to find any non-linear dependence. Savit [56] indicates that the difference between the linear and non-linear adjustments to any deviation from the equilibrium lies in whether or not the size of adjustment is proportional to the deviation. A proportional adjustment means a linear relationship, but this kind of adjustment cannot cause the randomness observed in financial and commodity markets.",

According to the ADF statistic criterion, the structural break years estimated on the basis of the three models are mainly in 1980 and 1983. The structural break years of 1980 and 1983 were caused by the following: first, the oil price shock of 1979, which preceded economic recessions and decreased tourism activities. Second, another shock was the change in international political relationships. As with the descriptions of the last section, in 1979 the United States changed its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan, and this policy resulting in Taiwan facing difficult international and cross-strait political relationships. This severe international political situation prompted a prolonged slowdown in Taiwan's tourism growth. Finally, the adjustments of tourism policies also created some effects. In 1980, the Statute for the Development of Tourism was amended to encourage the construction of international tourist hotels. Moreover, the first management offices of the national scenic area administration were set up in 1982.",

The Tourism Bureau assisted in reconstructing public facilities under relief loans for tourist industries. More international promotions were carried out to attract foreign tourists [23]. After facing the detrimental effects of SARS, Taiwan's government launched a US$ 75 million promotional campaign to recover from the devastating impact of SARS on the tourism industry [42].

Nevertheless, in the long run these disasters did not generate a structural break as our empirical results show. Furthermore, economic variables may exhibit non-linear dependencies, and in future research we suggest that researchers should consider the non-linear factor in the dynamic GDP\u2013tourism relation.",
