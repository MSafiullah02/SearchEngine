They are classified on the basis of their core proteins into three distinct types: A, B, and C.4 Influenza A viruses infect a range of mammalian and avian species, whereas type B and C are essentially restricted to human beings. Influenza A viruses are responsible for annual epidemics and occasional pandemics, whereas influenza B viruses cause outbreaks every 2\u20134 years, but are not associated with pandemics. The main antigenic determinants of influenza A and B viruses are two surface glycoproteins: the neuraminidase and the haemagglutinin, both capable of eliciting immune responses in human beings. The haemagglutinin is involved with receptor binding and membrane fusion. The neuraminidase facilitates cleavage of virus progeny from infected cells, prevents viral aggregation, and aids movement through the mucosal respiratory-tract epithelium. Virus strains are classified according to host species of origin, geographic site and year of isolation, serial number, and, for influenza A, by serological properties of subtypes of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase.",

A lack of effective proofreading by the viral RNA polymerase leads to a high rate of transcription errors that can result in aminoacid substitutions in surface glycoproteins. Virus variants with substitutions in the antibody-binding sites can evade humoral immunity and reinfect individuals. This is termed \u201cantigenic drift\u201d. The segmented viral genome allows for a second type of antigenic variation. If two influenza viruses simultaneously infect a host cell, genetic reassortment may generate a novel virus with new surface or internal proteins. Pandemic influenza viruses arise by this process of \u201cantigenic shift\u201d, when a virus with a new haemagglutinin subtype emerges and spreads efficiently in a naive human population. Comparisons of pandemic and interpandemic influenza are shown in table 1\n.",

The haemagglutinin of human influenza viruses preferentially binds to sialic acid receptors containing \u03b12,6-galactose linkages, whereas avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to those containing \u03b12,3-galactose linkages. These binding preferences correlate with the predominance of sialic acid \u03b12,6-galactose linkages on human epithelial cells, and \u03b12,3-galactose linkages on avian intestinal epithelial cells.7, 8, 9 Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for receptor-binding specificity are poorly defined, it is believed that haemagglutinin of avian origin must acquire human receptor-binding specificity to generate influenza strains capable of sustained human-to-human transmission. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that only one or two aminoacid mutations are required for this change.10 Limited passage in human beings of a virus possessing an avian haemagglutinin, such as occurring in Asia currently,2, 3 may be sufficient to generate such a change.",

Human-avian reassortant viruses seem to have caused the pandemics of 1957 and 1968. The 1957 H2N2 virus differed by three genes (haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and-the RNA polymerase PB1) from the H1N1 virus that infected people between 1918 and 1957. The 1968 H3N2 virus differed by two genes (haemagglutinin and PB1) from the H2N2 virus that infected people between 1957 and 1968. In both cases, the H2 and H3 haemagglutinin genes were contributed by avian viruses.11 Sequence analyses of early H2 and H3 isolates indicate receptor-binding specificity was altered by a single aminoacid substitution soon after human introduction.10 Since pig trachea contains receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses, and can support replication of viruses of both human and avian origin, it has been suggested that genetic reassortment between avian, swine, and human influenza viruses may occur in pigs, and that they represent a \u201cmixing bowl\u201d for the evolution of human pandemic strains.12 Haemagglutinin and neuraminidase of H5N1 viruses isolated from human beings, poultry, and wild ducks have distinguishable properties.13 Chickens seem to support a separate natural reservoir of influenza viruses, indicating a possible role as intermediate hosts in zoonotic transmission. Some avian H9 viruses established in poultry are capable of two-way transmission between domestic ducks, where they are able to generate multiple reassortants with other cocirculating viruses.14 These reassortant viruses have haemagglutinin receptor-binding sequences potentially capable of human infection, suggesting that new viruses may emerge directly from the avian pool. The close proximity of people to high concentrations of waterfowl, poultry, and swine in southeast Asia, and avian influenza activity, has identified this region as a hypothetical influenza epicentre (figure 1\n).15\n",

Although it is unclear whether the recent reported increase in transmission of avian influenza to people (table 2\n) is the result of heightened surveillance, the geographical expansion of H5N1 poultry outbreaks across Asia is an unprecedented and new event. More than 30 confirmed cases of transmission of avian H5N1 virus to human beings has increased the possibility that an avianhuman reassortant virus may emerge to effectively transmit among people.2, 3\n",

Despite the elimination of ducks, geese, and quail (sources of H5N1 and its donor genes) and cleaning days in the markets, H5N1 viruses have subsequently reemerged in Hong Kong poultry markets,32 although Hong Kong remains free from infection in the 2004 H5N1 outbreak across Asia.29, 33 In late 2002, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were isolated from dead waterfowl in Hong Kong (personal communication, M Peiris, University of Hong Kong), which was notable since H5N1 viruses do not typically cause disease in waterfowl. In February 2003, H5N1 reemerged in Hong Kong in two family members returning from a trip to China.24 In 2004, pathogenic H5N1 viruses are causing extensive poultry outbreaks in Asia with 23 deaths (68%) of 34 human cases reported in Vietnam and Thailand.2, 3, 30\n",

G1-like H9 viruses caused the 1999 human infections and contained internal genes homologous to those of the 1997 human H5N1 virus, suggesting that reassortment between the strains had already taken place,36, 37 whereas the 2003 human isolate was of Y280 (G9-like) lineage (personal communication W Lim, Government Virus Unit, Queen Mary Hospital, Department of Health, Hong Kong, China). Avian H9N2 viruses are now widespread in poultry,38 and have also transmitted to swine in Hong Kong and China.38, 39, 40 Some avian H9 viruses have acquired receptor-binding characteristics typical of human strains, increasing the potential for reassortment within both human and pig respiratory tracts.41\n",

Infection with avian influenza A viruses in birds causes a wide spectrum of disease ranging from subclinical to overwhelming systemic illness (figure 2\n). Both H5 and H7 subtypes have the ability to evolve into highly pathogenic forms. Although virulence is a polygenic trait, a major contributing factor in birds is the haemagglutinin. Cleavage of the haemagglutinin into two subunits is essential for viral infectivity.44 Haemagglutinin from strains of low pathogenicity is cleaved by proteases limited to the respiratory tract of mammalian species and the intestinal tract of avian species. By contrast, haemagglutinin from highly pathogenic viruses can be cleaved by proteases present in a range of tissues, resulting in multi-system infection. Structural features at the cleavage site determine the cleavability of the haemagglutinin. The acquisition of multiple basic aminoacids in highly pathogenic H5 or H7 haemagglutinin enables cleavage of the protein by these ubiquitous proteases and confers virulence. Carbohydrate side chains in the vicinity of the cleavage site may also affect the access of the proteases and hence virulence.45\n",

In primed patients, as is the case during interpandemic periods, no difference in immunogenicity between whole-virus vaccine and subunit or split-product vaccines was reported.

            "text": "Since influenza A viruses possess a segmented genome, simultaneous infection of eggs with two different viruses may result in reassortment of segments to produce a desired vaccine seed strain. The influenza A virus components of annual influenza vaccines are typically derived from egggrown reassortment viruses that have the relevant haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the antigenically relevant strain, and the six remaining gene segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1). These PR/8/34 segments confer high growth properties in eggs favoured for inactivated vaccine production.58 This process requires large numbers of eggs, and in many companies lacks the flexibility to respond rapidly to a pandemic event. Highly pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses cannot be grown in large quantities because they are lethal to chicken embryos.72 Such pathogenic strains also impose regulatory and safety issues. As the multibasic sequence cleavage site is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 infection, vaccine preparation from wild-type H5N1 virus would require heightened biocontainment to protect workers and eliminate the possibility of environmental contamination and infection of susceptible animals. Thus, several approaches have been attempted for avian influenza vaccine development. These include: (1) the production of inactivated vaccine from wildtype virus; (2) the selection of an antigenically related nonpathogenic vaccine strain; (3) the use of baculoviruses to express recombinant haemagglutinin; (4) DNA-based vaccines; (5) the use of plasmid-based reverse genetics systems to construct vaccine seed strains possessing attenuated haemagglutinin; and (6) plasmid-based reverse genetic systems to construct attenuated donor strain recombinants. Reverse genetics is likely to produce the most rapid response in an emerging pandemic. Much of the preclinical and clinical development of highly pathogenic avian influenza vaccines has used H5 virus as a model.",

Both A/duck/Hokkaido/67/96 (H5N4) and A/duck/Singapore/97 (H5N3) have haemagglutinin proteins antigenically similar to A/Hong Kong/ 156/97 (H5N1) and were used in experimental vaccines.72, 73 Although antibody titres to H5N1 induced by A/duck/Singapore (H5N3) vaccine were four-fold lower than the homologous strain,73 inactivated whole-virus vaccine72, 73 and alum-adjuvanted subunit vaccine48 were capable of protecting mice against lethal H5N1 challenge. Although attempts to reassort A/duck/Singapore (H5N3) with A/PR/8/34 to produce a high-growth virus suitable for vaccine production failed,73 conventional and MF59-adjuvanted A/duck/ Singapore/97 (H5N3) surface-antigen vaccines were clinically assessed in a randomised phase I trial.75 Two doses of 7\u00b75, 15, or 30\u03bcg H5 haemagglutinin were given 3 weeks apart. Antibody responses were measured by haemagglutinininhibition, virus microneutralisation, and SRH. Although both vaccines were well tolerated, non-adjuvanted vaccine was poorly immunogenic, with only one of 11 (9%) recipients seroconverting by haemagglutinin-inhibition and SRH H5N1, and four (36%) by microneutralisation and SRH H5N3 after two 30\u03bcg doses. The addition of MF59 gave significantly higher antibody responses (figure 4\n), and two doses achieved seroconversion rates of 13/31 (42%), 29(94%), 31(100%), and 26(84%) by haemagglutinin-inhibition, microneutralisation, SRH H5N3, and SRH H5N1, respectively. Antibody titres by SRH to H5N1 were about half those to H5N3, showing the need for close antigenic matching between vaccine and pandemic strains to ensure maximum vaccine efficacy. Antibody responses after H5N3 revaccination 16 months later were boosted significantly above those achieved after two doses.76\n",

If the erythrocytes used in the test are not optimised for expression of \u03b12,3- galactose linkages that are necessary for avian influenza virus binding, the test is insensitive.80 However, there are no recognised clinical correlates of immune protection for neutralisation antibody. It was only possible to assess vaccine responses with respect to CPMP licensing criteria after development of a specific SRH assay.81 A modified haemagglutinin-inhibition test, using enzymatically altered turkey erythrocytes or horse erythrocytes, was developed to increase the sensitivity for detecting antibody to avian influenza virus antigens.82\n",

The appropriate haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from a virus can be cloned and, if necessary, the haemagglutinin may be attenuated by removal of the multi-basic cleavage site sequence, and inserted into plasmids. The plasmids are transfected into a cell line together with plasmids encoding the internal genes from the A/PR8/34 virus to generate an appropriate non-pathogenic vaccine seed strain. Vaccine candidates expressing the target haemagglutinin from highly pathogenic viruses could potentially be produced within weeks of an emerging event. Recombinant H5 viruses showing desirable properties for H5 vaccine formulation\u2014including loss of egg lethality, virulence, and infectivity in animal models\u2014have been produced,87, 88 although one attenuated recombinant virus showed limited neurovirulence in mice.87 Reverse genetics is thus capable of generating attenuated viruses from pathogenic strains suitable for vaccine production with only limited enhancement of biosecurity measures and using pre-existing equipment and facilities. It should also be possible to prepare panels of reassortant viruses and vaccine seed candidates containing target genes of potential pandemic viruses in advance of any specific threat. However, there are regulatory, safety, and legal problems to overcome before the technology can be used for vaccine development. Mammalian cell lines (eg, Vero cells) used for transfection must be of certified quality for human vaccine production. Viruses generated by reverse genetics may be considered to be \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d, imposing local and national safety regulations regarding research and development. In addition, intellectual property rights on reverse genetics technology are held, and licences may need to be granted for commercial use of vaccines.",

Although well tolerated, whole-virus vaccine was more reactive, in keeping with H1N1 vaccines. There was little detectable crossreactive immune response to an antigenically distinct G9 H9 virus (unpublished findings). More than 40% of the prevaccination serum samples showed reactivity to H9N2 by neutralisation and haemagglutinin-inhibition, suggesting preexisting crossreacting antibody from exposure to earlier haemagglutinins. It is unlikely that H9 influenza has circulated widely in the UK. Further serological testing correlated H9 reactivity with antibody responses to H2, but not H1 or H3 haemagglutinin. People with baseline reactivity to H9 were born before 1969, and thus had been potentially exposed to H2 during its period of circulation in human beings. Subjects were immunologically divided into naive and primed recipients. In truly naive subjects, one dose of either vaccine was poorly immunogenic. Although whole-virus vaccine was more immunogenic than subunit vaccine, two doses still left a significant number of vaccinees with serological responses below the protective threshold (table 3\n) Among primed individuals, one dose of either vaccine boosted anti-H9 responses, fulfilling CPMP criteria. Since the second dose was of questionable value, to preserve limited vaccine supplies during the first wave of an emerging pandemic, different schedules in different populations could be considered. A German study among 18\u201360 year-olds reported one dose of 15 \u03bcg whole-virus vaccine A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) capable of fulfilling at least one CPMP criterion and that a second dose of vaccine significantly improved responses.71 However, age-related responses or the effect of pre-existing reactivity to H9N2 were not analysed. In keeping with the H2N2 experience, alum-adjuvant allowed a reduction in H9 content to 1\u00b73 \u03bcg per dose while maintaining immunogenicity.",

Donor strains are cold adapted, temperature-sensitive, and attenuated. These properties are associated with polygenic mutations. These live attenuated viruses display high levels of phenotypic and genotypic stability and are not transmissible to close seronegative contacts.101 Both attenuated H5N1 and H9N2/Ann Arbor cold-adapted recombinant viruses have been generated and are seen to be non-pathogenic in mammalian and chicken models.98, 102 Concerns over the generation of a reassortant between a live virus vaccine containing an avian influenza virus and a co-infecting human strain, and the possibility of spontaneous genetic change may limit the use of such vaccines in the interpandemic period. While current intramuscular influenza vaccines are effective at inducing relatively strainspecific serum haemagglutination-inhibition IgG, they are poor at stimulating secretory IgA in nasal wash fluid.103, 104 As secretory IgA exhibits potential heterotypic crossreactivity to influenza virus strains at the point of entry,104, 105 live attenuated virus vaccines may offer wider protection against vaccinedrifted variants that could be advantageous once a pandemic is underway.",

Antiviral drugs may be of benefit in protecting individuals in essential services whilst waiting for an effective vaccine to be prepared; however, supply and cost issues would limit their effect on the course of a pandemic.

The 2004 Asian H5N1 epizoonotic outbreak indicates the urgent need for vaccines against avian influenza viruses. However, regulatory and safety considerations confront their development (panel 2\n). It is necessary to improve our understanding of the virulence determinants in mammalian systems to be able to attenuate viruses to select appropriate and safe vaccine strains that can generate broad crossreactivity. National and international authorities must urgently confront regulatory issues to allow production and clinical assessment of newly generated virus vaccine candidates. There are important observations from our clinical experience with vaccines for pandemic influenza (panel 3\n). Despite increased reactogenicity, the greater immunogenicity of whole-virus vaccines could be beneficial in a pandemic. Vaccines containing avian H5 and H9 haemagglutinin seem to be less immunogenic in human beings than vaccines based on H1 and H2 haemagglutinin. Whether this is a general event associated with avian subtypes is at present unclear. Enhancement with MF59 or alum salts may provide best antigen use and enhance immunogenicity. Overall, so far, clinical trials of avian influenza vaccine candidates have given disappointing results. It remains to be seen how plasmid-derived reverse-genetics influenza vaccines will perform once regulatory hurdles have been overcome.Panel 2Avian influenza virus vaccine development\nSurveillance\nNeed for robust surveillance programmes in human and animal populations and sharing of information between animal and human surveillance systems Surveillance information to be open and shared in a timely fashion to assess potential threats Potential pandemic strains come from animal reservoir.\nSelection of a vaccine strain\nImproved understanding of the antigenic and molecular associations between potential pandemic strains of same subtype Improved understanding of immunogenicity against drifted avian influenza strains is required as the ability to generate broad crossprotective immunity is desirable in vaccine candidate.\nManufacturing of vaccine\nIntellectual property rights of attenuated viruses produced by reverse genetics must be addressed in advance because licences for commercial use may be required Vaccine virus candidate needs to be able to grow well in eggs (or approved cell culture) to improve ability to respond rapidly to emerging threat Improved understanding of virulence determinants in mammalian models to be able to attenuate viruses used for vaccine manufacture Safety of virus handling for workers involved in preparation of vaccine\nRegulatory issues\nTo assess and approve mammalian cell lines of human vaccine quality Ensure that reagents from animal sources are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies compliant \u201cReverse genetics\u201d generated viruses are labelled as genetically modified organisms\u2014implications for national and local regulatory authorities Clinical assessment of vaccines derived by reverse genetics Ability to organise antigenicity studies rapidly in response to emerging threat may require prepared approved protocols that can be readily adapted.\nImmunogenicity\nImprovement in assessment of antibody responses to avian influenza vaccines to establish licensing criteria Standardisation of assays for detection of neutralising antibody to avian influenza Establish correlates of immune protection of neutralising antibodyPanel 3Clinical findings with pandemic vaccine candidates against human and avian influenza subtypesWhole-virus vaccine more immunogenic than subunit or split-product vaccine in immunological naive populations (H1N1, H9N2) Two doses of vaccine required in immunologically naive populations, the first to prime and the second to boost responses (H1N1, H2N2, H5N3, H9N2)In primed populations, a single dose of vaccine can potentially induce responses associated with protection (H1N1, H5N3, H9N2) Addition of adjuvants such as MF59 and aluminium salts have the potential to significantly enhance immunogenicity and spare antigen use (H5N3, H9N2 and H2N2)Avian haemagglutinin (H5 and to a lesser extent H9) seems to be less immunogenic in people than H1 and H2 Assessment of antibody responses to avian influenza may require additional serological methods other than the standard haemagglutinininhibition test (H5N3)Potential crossreactivity with pre-existing antibodies complicates interpretation of immune responses in people (H9N2) Need to develop understanding of improving vaccine candidates to enhance heterosubtypic crossreactivity and protection Need to assess vaccine candidates in advance of pandemic to identify difficulties and establish dosing schedules in different populations",
