The positive result is a single band of a specific size at a particular location on agarose gel.\nSpecificity: If the oligonucleotides are designed well, the PCR reaction will give a single band specific for a particular microorganism. In the absence of the microorganism or in the presence of a different microorganism, no such band will be seen.\nSensitivity: As a PCR reaction amplifies even minuscule amounts of genetic material. It is this 100\u20131000 times sensitive than ELISA-based techniques that detects signals once the infection is well established. Furthermore, after the waning of the infection, the PCR signal will drop, but the immune signals will remain giving an erroneous result.\nFlexibility: Multiple reactions can be run in a single tube giving a result that appears as multiple marker bands for the same microorganism for better cross checking of the results.\nSpeed: A PCR reaction is relatively quick to perform and as many as 96 samples can be analysed in a single run. If the whole plate is run, it also is much cheaper than conventional assays.\n",

Although PCR-based diagnostics services are available in eastern India, it is not well organized and professionally managed for it to become a commercially viable business option. PCR-based diagnostics are still in the novelty stage where certain PCR-based tests are used as a supportive test for the ELISA-based kits. The reasons are as follows:\nLack of unified approach and vision: \nThere is a severe lack of personnel with the adequate techno commercial background to make strategic plans for the tests to be pursued, the designing and execution of the tests as well as the business acumen to transform these tests from a highly specialized novelty item to easy-to-do mass service that can be a part of every clinical laboratory and hospital.\nLack of hands on technical knowledge among the established pathologists of this region: Partly due to commercial considerations and partly due to lack of adequate molecular biology training in the medical colleges, the pathologists do not have the expertise to carry out these tests as well as interpret these results. As a result, these tests have not gained in popularity.\nPresence of an organized lobby for the promotion of ELISA-based tests: The manufacturers and the distributors of the diagnostics kits in the city have a strong lobby that opposes the introduction of newer diagnostic tests that will replace the existing tests. This includes Government regulatory authorities that approve the tests.\nCompetition amongst pathological laboratories that cuts into each other: The competition amongst laboratories having the tests and those not having the tests results in sending of the tests to laboratories outside Kolkata to do the simple tests. A simple independent laboratory can tap into this business potential.\nLack of validated tests suitable for Indian conditions: All the reagents are imported from abroad and there are no validation studies carried out to see if they will be suitable for conditions here. Hence tests often turn out to be unreliable, as a result of which the medical community cannot trust these.\n",

These will give us a lead in designing the primers. PCR-based tests have been developed in isolated laboratories working with specific microorganisms, but nowhere has a systematic study of multiple pathogens been carried out for detection of both the DNA and RNA. Furthermore, no studies have been carried out systematically for multiplex PCR.\nInternational studies: Simple PCR-based assays are routinely used in labs abroad. However, since the strains are different in India, such tests need to be redesigned for Indian conditions. Below are a few examples of PCR-based assays done on bacterial cultures:\n\nTuberculosis: Genetic markers specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are well established and BioConsort has access to these primers. The positive results will look like the gel below (Fig. 5.1).\n\nHepatitis: This is the causative agent for Jaundice. It is difficult to distinguish between the B and the C types at an early stage of infection. However, they can be distinguished by PCR-based techniques.Hepatitis B: This is a DNA virus and a straightforward test from the blood of the patient results in a single clean band.Hepatitis C: This is the causative agent for Jaundice. It is an RNA virus, therefore, a Reverse Transcription-PCR needs to be done. A nested PCR might be necessary to get a clean band.\n\n",

            "text": "The research methodology to be used is as follows:\nDesigning PCR primers for identification of infectious diseases pathogens: This is the most important step in PCR-based diagnostics. The primers will be developed from unique sequences of the pathogens. As sequences in part or full are available in the gene bank database, primers will be designed from them. For multiplexing, multiple primers need to be designed to be used in a single reaction. Our lab has the expertise to design such primers while making sure that they do not self-anneal. Once the primers are ready, the PCR conditions will be standardized for the assays.\nCollection of blood and extraction of the genetic material: The genetic material will be extracted from 0.5 ml of the blood. Briefly, it will be spun down to pellet the cells and the plasma will be treated with chemicals to lyse the cells and free the genetic material. It will then be passed through a Qiagen QIAamp column (or a similar column procured from an Indian manufacturer and washed with the supplied buffer and precipitated with alcohol to get the DNA. PCR reaction will be set up using this DNA.For RNA viruses, an additional step will be required. The RNA will be extracted in the same way as DNA and a reverse transcription reaction will be carried out. This will convert the RNA into cDNA and the PCR reaction will be carried out using this cDNA.\nPCR reaction: The PCR reaction will be carried out with either the DNA or the cDNA. The assay conditions will be standardized for the following conditions:\nAnnealing temperatures: A range of 55\u201372 \u00b0C will be used and the highest temperature giving a single band will be chosen. For multiplex PCR the conditions will be standardized again. However, it is assumed that since the primers will be exact matches of the DNA sequences, a temperature above 65 \u00b0C will give optimum results.No of cycles: So as to reduce the number of cycles and time for the reaction, a 15 cycle, a 20 cycle, a 25 cycle and a 30 cycle reaction will be tried.\n\nAnalyzing the results on an agarose gel: The results will be analysed on an agarose gel. The band size will be compared to a positive control kept for this purpose. A blank lane for the negative control will indicate a clean PCR reaction with no contamination. The composition of the gel and gel running conditions will be standardized so as to minimize the time and costs for the reaction.\nValidation of the assays: The assays will be validated against ELISA-based tests already available in the market. A sample size of 100 will be used for validation to test the reliability of the assay. Once the assays are validated, the know-how and the methodology for conducting the study will be out licensed.We will develop and validate the following assays in a phase wise manner.\nIn Phase 1, the commercially important assays will be developed. They will be the following:\nM. tuberculosis\nHepatitis BHepatitis C\nOut of the three, the first two are DNA viruses and the third one is an RNA virus. So, both PCR and Reverse Transcriptase assays will be developed. As there is an urgent need for these assays they will be first assays to be developed. First simple PCR assays will be developed followed by multiplex PCR and nested PCRs if necessary.Time and budget permitting, the following assays will also be attempted and the promising ones will be taken forward.Hepatitis C virus (RNA)Hepatitis E virus (RNA)\nPlasmodium falciparum\n\nPlasmodium vivax\n\nSalmonella typhi\n\nVibrio cholerae.\n\n\nPhase 2: As soon as the first phase of tests has been developed, we will introduce a new upcoming technology, a Rapid PCR for quick diagnostics of the infectious disease pathogens that can be used almost as a POC medicine. This will use the same reagents developed during the earlier assays with slight modifications. Phase 3: After the second year, newer rarer assays will be developed as per the needs of the industry in consultation with the physicians. Our lab will develop assays for the detection of a few of the following infectious agents:\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\nClostridium botulinum\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\nDengue virus (RNA)Japanese encephalitis virus (RNA)Poliovirus (RNA)Mumps virus (RNA)Rabies virus (RNA)Enteric adenovirus\nMeasles virus\nAvian influenza virus (H5N1)SARS coronavirusInfluenza virus (various forms)Rotavirus (RNA)\n\n",

            "text": "Various other commercially available EBC collection systems are available [10]. One such example is EcoScreen\u00ae (JaegerTonnies, Hoechberg, Germany). The design of the equipment is similar to a home-made device, apart from the ability to collect samples in a frozen state. This may be very useful when collecting volatile substance in EBC. However, if the temperature of the cooling apparatus fluctuates, it leads to collection of EBC in a mixed liquid\u2013solid form. Such inconsistencies in EBC collection result in differences in concentrations reported in different studies. For analysis of multiple analytes, the collection vial needs to be replaced with smaller vials. For scaling-up operations, the cost of a condenser should also be considered. The EcoScreen\u00ae II can be used to assess respiratory parameters during collection or may be connected to a pneumotachograph and a computer to enable recording of respiratory parameters online [10]. Additionally, EcoScreen II is capable of collecting EBC from the airways or the alveoli in separate compartments/bags. This enables comparison of the EBC between the two in normal and diseased state. The surface of the collecting system (plastics vs. Teflon-coated metal) may also be more appropriate for the collection of compounds such as lipids. However, no published studies are available with this condenser.",

            "text": "The RTube\u00ae (Respiratory Research, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) is another commercially available portable condenser [11]. RTube\u00ae comprises a disposable polypropylene collecting system and an aluminium sleeve around it for refrigeration [11]. The temperature for cooling may be chosen by the user. Due to its portable nature, RTube\u00ae can be easily used in longitudinal studies where the measurement is required multiple times a day. Further, the polypropylene collecting bag can easily be stored in the refrigerator at home. However, the temperature in a home refrigerator (\u221220 \u00b0C) may differ from a laboratory freezer (\u221280 \u00b0C) which may result in loss of some volatile compounds. Its design also prevents salivary contamination [11]. It can also be used for determining pH of EBC using pHTube\u00ae (Respiratory Research, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) [11]. For pH measurement, sufficient volume may be collected in about a minute [11]. The collected EBC still needs to be taken to the laboratory for biochemical tests. Comparison of EBC collected from RTube and EcoScreen reported higher volumes of the condensate and detection of lipid and protein mediators in EBC collected from EcoScreen. Further studies to address this issue are required. Standardization of the sterilization protocol for EBC equipment is necessary to reduce cross contamination. Currently, the equipment is sterilized using an antibacterial solution such as sodium hypochlorite for 1 h followed by rinses with water. The effect of different collection material on the components of EBC is unknown. In EcoScreen the condenser is coated with Teflon\u00ae (E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Inc., Washington, DE) to avoid loss of molecules by adhering to the service. Borosilicate glass coating was found to be better than silicone, aluminium, polypropylene and Teflon for albumin detection. These results suggest that the condenser material needs to be according to the molecules/compounds to be detected. Further use of separate sensors for simultaneous collection of different compounds such as hydrogen peroxide [12] and inflammatory mediators may be developed. Further effect of the antiseptic solutions used for cleaning and optimization of collection protocol to enable simultaneous collection of material is required (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4).\n\n",

            "text": "Assessment of EBC is a non-invasive technique used to sample the lower airways. Collection of EBC involves tidal breathing (inhalation & exhalation during restful breathing) into a collection device, which is chilled. The chilled collection device allows the water vapour in the EBC to condense and be collected. Quantitation of different mediators and factors can be done from the collected condensate. The mediators that are quantified originate from the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) that gets mobilized during expiration [17]. Different inflammatory mediators, from simple pro-oxidant molecules to larger proteins, are found in the EBC of patients with diseases like COPD, asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite being a promising and non-invasive technique, several questions have been raised regarding its methodologies that have delayed its adoption as a clinical technique. There is no standardized method for the collection of EBC, and different investigators have used collection devices ranging from Teflon tubing, convection cylinders and ice baths. Thus, before the use of EBC is mainstreamed, a standard method for collection must be determined. Nowadays, EBC collection devices, like RTubeTM from Respiratory Research, Inc., USA, and EcoScreen, from Viasys, are commercially available [10]. There is also the problem of dilution of EBC. The respiratory droplets get diluted, often as much as 10,000 folds, when they are collected in the water-saturated exhaled breath [17]. This poses a problem because mediators and soluble factors are already present at very low concentrations which can be detected by only few, very-sensitive tests. Detection is especially a problem in case of proteins, as they may not get aerosolized. This dilution may differ among test subjects, making it difficult to standardize the test. The American Thoracic Society, as well as the European Respiratory Society, have issued guidelines for the collection of EBC which have attempted to address the above-mentioned issues [18]. It has been suggested that standardization of the EBC mediators may be done by measuring the quantities of non-volatile cations in the EBC [17]. This is considered to give an idea about the degree of dilution, as cation levels in the ELF remain somewhat constant. However, for this method to work, the EBC has to be lyophilized and ammonia removed from it, which may lead to changes in the levels of the biomarkers. Regardless of these issues, EBC analysis has the potential to be a powerful technique for assessing the lung diseases.",

This shows that assessment of EBC can help in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases [10]. Mediators present in the EBC of COPD patients include hydrogen peroxide, hydrocarbons (like isoprostanes) and cytokines, of which H2O2 is the most studied.\nHydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n): H2O2 is derived from the superoxide radical that is produced by neutrophils in the airways, and is a marker for \noxidative stress and underlying inflammation of the airway. EBC of COPD patients have higher levels of H2O2 compared to healthy controls, and the levels further rise with exacerbation of the disease [19]. The H2O2 levels, measured by EBC, can be correlated with the severity of the disease measured by the FEV1/FVC ratio [19]. H2O2 levels in the EBC of COPD patients can be reduced by n-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of H2O2 in COPD. H2O2 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of COPD, as an indicator of neutrophilic inflammation, since neutrophils are predominant in the airways in COPD [19]. Also, measurement of H2O2 in EBC can be done easily using inexpensive chemicals.\nIsoprostanes: Isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds that are formed by the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of essential fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, without the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Chemically stable, and formed in vivo, they are considered to be markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in humans. Of the isoprostanes, 8-isoprostane has been thoroughly studied as a marker for oxidative stress in human lung diseases. It may be important in the development of COPD. Several studies have shown that the levels of 8-isoprostane are higher in the EBC of COPD patients than in normal healthy controls [10, 19]. Its levels have been found to increase with exacerbation of the disease. However, measurement of pulmonary function with FEV1/FVC showed no correlation between pulmonary function and 8-isoprostane [10, 19]. COPD patients who are also smokers have higher levels of 8-isoprostane than non-smoking COPD patients [10]. Thus, it can be used as a marker for underlying inflammation of the airways. Isoprostane can be measured using a commercial immunoassay kit.\nOther mediators: Other markers of oxidative stress, like aldehydes, have been found in EBC, but their instability and lack of specificity limit their use clinically. EBC of COPD patient has a lower pH than normal, and thus, can be used as a marker for airway inflammation [19]. Cytokines are also found in the EBC, but in very low levels (in the range of pg/ml). The level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) was found to be higher in COPD patients.\n",

Another factor that is considered as a marker is pH.\nHydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n): EBC of heavy smokers and patients with severe asthma has been found to have high levels of H2O2. H2O2 levels in the EBC of patients with severe allergic asthma show an inverse correlation to pulmonary function, as measured by the FEV1/FVC test. Anti-inflammatory therapy of asthma patients has shown an improvement in the FEV1/FVC, along with a decline in the H2O2 levels.\nEicosanoids: Eicosanoids are a group of compounds including prostaglandins and related compounds, most of which are formed from arachidonic acid. Leukotrienes (LTs) and 8-isoprostanes, which are eicosanoids, can be measured in the EBC by enzyme immunoassays or by GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). Cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) have been found in the EBC of asthmatic patients, the levels of which seem to be correlated with the severity of the disease, and are found to be reduced by anti-inflammatory drugs. 8-isoprostane is also found in the EBC of asthmatic patients and is correlated with the disease-severity. However, levels of 8-isoprostane do not get completely suppressed by treatment with corticosteroids, and maybe indicative of airway inflammation.\npH: Several studies have found that the EBC of asthmatic patients had a pH of 7.5, which is lower than the normal pH of 7.8. Exacerbations of the disease lead to a further decrease in the pH, which was restored with corticosteroid treatment. The advantages of using pH as a marker in EBC includes low costs of collection, good reproducibility and availability of standard references.\nExhaled nitric oxide (eNO): Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) is considered a sensitive marker for airway inflammation, especially in allergic asthma. Higher levels of eNO can indicate exacerbation of the disease. It can also indicate a loss of asthma control. A correlation has been found between the levels of eNO and allergen challenges, especially late asthmatic response (LAR).\n",

The EBC of people with allergic rhinitis also contains several mediators which can be used as a marker for the disease. Just like EBC of asthmatics have eNO, EBC of people suffering from allergic rhinitis contains nasal nitric oxide (nNO). Standard techniques have been developed for measurement of NO in the airways. Currently, nNO is measured using the portable analyzer, MINO, and the results have been validated against results from standard chemiluminescent assays. Thus, this technique, which is non-invasive, easy and quick, can be used as a tool for diagnosis. Generally, nNO levels range from 400 to 900 parts per billion (ppb). Paranasal sinuses produce high levels of nNO (up to 25 ppm) by the action of inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) of the epithelium. It has been seen that when an inhibitor of NOS is administered to a healthy individual, the nNO levels drop, leading to inflammation of the sinus.",

It is now imperative that techniques for collection of EBC and its measurement be standardized. This is a tough ask as each marker differs in stability, solubility, volatility and concentration. As a result, no one technique is enough for the measurement of the different molecules. Presently, one main limitation of EBC measurement is the very low concentration of some biomarkers, thus limiting their measurement due to assays which are not sensitive enough. It is possible that, as potent antibodies are developed, more sensitive assays will also ensue.",
