Sir William Osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, \u201cHumanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.\u201d Despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicated\u2014variola virus, the agent of smallpox. In its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics. Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the \u201cBlack Death\u201d caused by Yersinia pestis in 14th century Europe. However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. Focusing on viruses, a catalogue of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time.1 However, of the more than 100 virus families, only 22 have been associated with human infections, a number that seems to have plateaued.1 In this chapter we will concentrate on vaccines for emerging viral diseases.\n",

Emerging viral infections with pandemic potential can be chronic, persistent, or acute in nature. They can be disseminated by respiratory droplet or other bodily fluids. They can emerge from animal reservoirs and spread via insect vectors, and can be precipitated by changes in climate, animal habitats, human population dynamics, and other ecological events.2 And they can emerge as a consequence of human activity in the context of deliberate viral modification as a form of biowarfare. We are faced with important questions including what can be done to anticipate these events and how can we best prepare to intervene when new or changing viral threats arrive?",

In the setting of a new pandemic viral threat and without the advantage of a preexisting understanding of its pathogenesis, growth or attenuating features, it would be difficult to quickly develop traditional live-attenuated or whole-inactivated vaccine approaches due to uncertainty about the safety of attenuating mutations or the production of replication-competent virus in bulk. Therefore, it is more likely that developing vaccines for emerging infections will involve new technologies, some of which have not yet been licensed for human use. Using technologies that can provide a candidate vaccine based on information derived entirely from target gene sequences is safer and more expeditious than procedures requiring virus isolation and growth that require a high level of containment. Therefore, even for virus families for which there are currently licensed vaccines, additional approaches beyond live-attenuated and whole-inactivated products should also be pursued.",

In part because of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, emergence of new viral threats to public health are becoming more of a global concern and have more media and political visibility. Fortunately, this is a time of remarkable technical advances in human monoclonal antibody discovery, structure-guided antigen design, and nucleic acid sequencing\u2014making rapid development of biologics more feasible. Therefore, defining new approaches and pathways to efficiently deploy vaccine interventions for emerging infections is a priority for public health agencies, commercial entities, government officials, and nonprofit organizations.

Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process.3\n",

Chikungunya, an alphavirus in the Togaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquito vectors with a high attack rate and causes a systemic disease with low mortality but high frequency of chronic disabling arthritis. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV), a beta-coronavirus and member of the Coronaviridae family, is spread by respiratory droplets and causes a relatively high mortality in persons with underlying disease. It has a reproductive rate (R\n0) of <1 for person-to-person spread, but occasional \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d can infect multiple people.

Five species of Ebola have been identified including Zaire (the cause of the 2014 West African epidemic), Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Reston. Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first recognized in two distinct outbreaks in the Ebola River Valley of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and in Sudan in 1976.5., 6. EVD emerged again in 1994 in Gabon and in 1995 in an outbreak involving 315 people in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Ebola was confirmed by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electron microscopy, or from isolation in cell culture.10 Viral RNA was extracted, sequenced, and compared to available Ebola sequences in GenBank enabling phylogenetic analysis. An Ebola strain was identified with 97% similarity to previously collected Ebola strains in the DRC and Gabon. In turn, the outbreak was traced to a single index case, a 2-year-old boy who died in Dec. 2013 in Gueckedou. The epidemic of EVD that followed has accounted for more cases than all prior EVD outbreaks combined. As of Jul. 2015, over 28,000 suspected and confirmed cases and more than 11,000 deaths have been reported with the majority of cases occurring in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.11 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern in Aug. of 2014. And as the outbreak emerged, the international community responded with an unprecedented effort to accelerate Ebola vaccine development.12 Prior to 2014, the largest single Ebola outbreak was 425 infections leading to 224 deaths.13\n",

These phase I studies showed the WT full-length GP was safe and well tolerated. In parallel, studies to define the immunological correlates of protection and optimal antigen delivery approaches were evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHP). In addition to the important role for antibodies targeting GP, it was found that CD8 T cell-mediated immunity was found to be critical for vaccine efficacy in NHP.17 It was also found that antivector immunity would diminish vaccine potency particularly for the induction of CD8 T cells. Because of the high seroprevalence of Ad5, rare serotype adenovirus vectors were explored including human rAd26 and rAd35 vectors, and chimpanzee-derived rAd vectors.18\n",

This vector was originally produced by Okairos which is now owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Vector potency comparable to rAd5 was considered to be important for rapid induction of both antibody and CD8 T cells with a single dose. This would facilitate use of the cAd3-Ebola GP vaccine in an outbreak setting using a ring vaccination strategy to achieve rapid short term protection for those at highest risk of infection. Both Zaire and Sudan GP were included in the initial vaccine to protect against both Zaire and Sudan, the most common species responsible for EVD. This replication-defective vaccine, now called cAd3-EBO, provided 100% protection to nonhuman primates 5 weeks following vaccination in an otherwise lethal Ebola challenge model, and partial protection (50%) to lethal challenge 10 months following vaccination. The cAd3-EBO was also shown to effectively prime for a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccine boost encoding the same glycoprotein inserts, improving survival from lethal Ebola challenge to 100% at 10-months postboost.19 The combination of cAd3-MVA prime-boost produces a much higher magnitude response and might provide more durable protection to health care workers, ambulance drivers, burial workers, and others with ongoing risk of Ebola exposure.",

Compared to strains circulating in West Africa it differed in very few GP residues outside the glycan cap, which is cleaved prior to virus entry. Mayinga was also more related genetically to the outbreak strain than the Kikwit strain that had been used in the NHP challenge studies. Therefore, the available cAd3 Ebola Zaire construct was thought to be antigenically relevant to the outbreak strain and suitable for testing. To directly address the West African crisis and to accelerate manufacturing timelines, additional phase I studies of the cAd3 vaccine in monovalent form (encoding the GP from Zaire, not Sudan species) were performed in the United States, United Kingdom, Mali, and Switzerland at doses ranging from 1 \u00d7 1010 to 1 \u00d7 1011.21 These studies, done in collaboration with GSK, supported advancement of the monovalent vaccine into an on-going phase II/III study in Liberia (NCT02344407) as well as US evaluation of a prime-boost regimen consisting of cAd3-EBO followed by MVA-EBOZ to evaluate durable immune responses (NCT02408913). The monovalent cAd3-EBOZ has also been evaluated as a prime for boosting with a recombinant MVA vector provided by Bavarian Nordic expressing the GP from Zaire, Sudan, and Marburg, and N from Tai Forest at sites in the United Kingdom and Mali. A similar vaccine approach using rAd28 priming and MVA boosting developed by Crucell (now owned by Janssen as part of Johnson & Johnson) has been evaluated in subsequent clinical trials.\n",

The vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, licensed to BioProtection Systems (a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics), and subsequently licensed to Merck. The donation of 800 vials of this vaccine by the Canadian government to WHO enabled initial evaluation of this candidate vaccine in 150 people at doses ranging from 300,000 to 50 million PFU in phase I trials in Gabon, Kenya, Germany, and Switzerland. Although no life-threatening adverse events were observed, there was evidence of unexpected viral seeding of joints and transient arthritis in addition to vaccine virus positive skin vesicles in some participants. A lower dose of rVSV-ZEBOV (300,000 PFU IM) did not diminish the likelihood of rVSV infecting peripheral tissues. Thirteen of 51 participants developed arthritis and 2 participants developed cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis with rVSV established as the etiology based on synovial fluid and skin lesion analysis.24., 25. The vaccine was immunogenic and all vaccine recipients evaluated developed GP-specific antibody responses.26 An additional evaluation of this candidate vaccine in two phase I trials in the United States (WRAIR and NIH) supported advancement of the vaccine at 20 million PFU dosing. Compared to 3 million PFU dosing, 20 million PFU resulted in higher IgG and neutralizing antibody titers.27 The higher dose vaccine is currently under evaluation in the NIAID-sponsored PREVAIL trial in Liberia, the CDC-sponsored STRIVE study in Sierra Leone, and the WHO-sponsored Ebola \u00e7a suffit study in Guinea. Notably, the skin and joint complications were not seen during active follow-up of individuals in the United States or African studies.",

However, the decline will likely preclude efforts to evaluate vaccine efficacy of other vaccine candidates during this outbreak. For the cAd3-EBO vaccine, it remains unknown if a path to licensure is feasible in the absence of human efficacy data.

Perhaps the most important is that the rapid development and testing of candidate vaccines in 2014 and 2015 was made possible because of years of prior investment into the study of Ebola basic virology and pathogenesis, in part driven by biodefense concerns. Other factors that enabled accelerated vaccine development include: (1) preexisting established animal models, (2) preclinical data from NHP challenge studies, (3) the presence of cGMP vaccine product, and (4) global concern, extensive media coverage and political visibility that helped foster coordination between funding agencies, regulatory authorities, governments, clinical trial sites, laboratories, commercial partners, and publishers.",

A live, attenuated CHIKV vaccine was advanced into phase II testing and induced neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV by day 28 in 98% of recipients but was also associated with arthralgias in 8% of subjects.48 Due to our familiarity with the limitations and obstacles for advancement of a candidate vaccine developed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center, we will focus the discussion primarily on a mammalian cell-produced VLP vaccine. This candidate vaccine was evaluated in a phase I clinical trial and is currently being advanced into phase II clinical testing. To produce the VLP, Akahata and coworkers transfected 293T HEK cells with expression vectors encoding C-E3-E2-6K-E1 proteins from the West African CHIKV strain 37997. Electron microscopy revealed production of VLPs with the same morphologic appearance as wild-type CHIKV, characterized by a 65 nm external diameter, 40 nm core diameter, and a structure with E1 and E2 glycoproteins organized into 240 heterodimers and 80 glycoprotein spikes. In preclinical assessment, all NHPs receiving this VLP developed neutralizing antibodies to both heterologous and homologous CHIKV strains. In a challenge model, all NHPs were protected against viremia as well as the postinflammatory sequelae of infection when exposed to intravenous CHIKV challenge 15 weeks after VLP administration.34\n",

Factors contributing to the delay in advanced development of this vaccine include difficulty in establishing a commercial partnership, resources needed for process development and scale-up, and difficulties in establishing clinical trial infrastructure for defining efficacy and immune correlates of protection. Due to the ongoing Chikungunya epidemic in the Americas and the Caribbean, there is an opportunity to obtain an efficacy result in a field trial. Therefore, advancing clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines should be a public health imperative. If field trials are delayed until the outbreak has saturated the region and the disease becomes more sporadic, it will be difficult to ever obtain an efficacy outcome or establish an immunological correlate of protection. This will complicate achieving licensure for general use, and is another example of how public options for manufacturing would facilitate the development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.",

MERS CoV is likely to continue to cause sporadic outbreaks, fueled by camel exposure and the occasional super-spreading event. However, the relatively low R0 suggests that MERS CoV has a relatively low probability of causing a widespread pandemic. Therefore, the target populations for a vaccine when available is not the general population, but groups at high risk of exposure to animal reservoirs, health care workers in endemic regions, and possibly at-risk travelers. With this relatively small market, it will be difficult for commercial organizations to invest in MERS CoV vaccine development. With such low incidence, a field study to evaluate efficacy will be large and difficult to complete. Therefore, questions again are raised about how to achieve advanced development and licensing of a vaccine for this type of emerging virus.",

If done with forethought, the development of such a program would strengthen existing health care programs, build research infrastructure, and significantly improve the status of global public health. In particular, we should take advantage of new technologies such as high throughput sequencing, isolation of human monoclonal antibodies, structural biology, atomic-level antigen design, molecular biology, and vector biology. These tools can provide the information needed for rapid achievement of optimal expression, immunogenicity, production, and delivery of vaccine antigens for new emerging threats like the current crisis caused by Zika virus (Fig. 28.2\n).",

Novel approaches to vaccine design may significantly shorten vaccine development timelines and increase the frequency of success. New technologies that have rapidly evolved over the last 5\u201310 years make atomic level antigen design feasible and provide mechanisms for rapid, iterative improvements in antigenicity and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines. In particular, high throughput sequencing provides a starting point for vaccine antigens and helps to define the extent of genetic variability. Relatively inexpensive gene synthesis, the ease of isolating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against target antigens, the ability to define structures of vaccine antigens in complex with mAbs with desirable functional properties, and the development of assays that evaluate immunogenicity of vaccines in animal models, provide the foundation for rapid development of highly characterized candidate vaccines and their advancement into clinical evaluation. The figure illustrates the steps taken in the case of MERS CoV to rapidly develop the tools needed to generate candidate vaccines. Advanced knowledge of effective vaccine approaches for a particular virus family together with these modern development and design approaches may significantly shorten the time needed to prepare vaccines for field testing in the setting of a new pandemic threat.",
