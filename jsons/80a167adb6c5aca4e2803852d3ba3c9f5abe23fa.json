Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain. Following our initial contribution of ntroducing special cutaneous \"sign\" tribute to healthcare workers managing new coronavirus disease (COVID \u221219) and subsequently a few addition by R. Darlenski et al, I would like to clarify my stance on their suggestions. 1,2 we could add the medics those who have sacrificed their lives to fight the Covid 19 pandemic other than the present medical staff who risk their precious lives at present for the same J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cause when defining this special sign. This sign mainly considering the classic cutaneous changes following heavy use of personal protective medical equipment on face; hence, no rationale of adding skin lesions elsewhere in the same population, also created by the extensive use of these medical devices as suggested by same authors .3,4 Finally, the newly introduced special cutaneous sign should be dedicated to the memory of those medical personnel who have sacrificed their precious lives as well as currently serving with the COVID-19 epidemic control and treatment care units possessing peculiar pressure injuries (erythema, deep indentations & ulcerations) on their faces related to the various personal protective equipment they have worn, should be described as manifesting the \"Covid 19 MS sign\" (MS for Medical Staff.) Apart from that ,while highly supporting and endorsing the newly described clinical sign by my colleagues both locally and internationally, a few of them were questioning the application of this sign for health care worker and those who have not displayed complete clinical picture of their faces following prolong usage of protective medical equipment. As a result, I would like to add new descriptive term as \"Partial COVID 19 MS sign\" related to \"COVID 19 MS sign\" denoted and depicted by following table and pictures (Table 1.) & ",
