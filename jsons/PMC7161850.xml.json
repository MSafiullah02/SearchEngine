Every year, more therapeutic products are produced from animal, human, or cell culture sources (1), and these sources contain an inherent risk of viral contamination. Therapeutic products from human blood plasma, antibodies, albumin, and factor VIII, just to name a few, could be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, B19 virus (formally known as parvovirus B19), SARS coronavirus, or one or more emerging viruses that have yet to be identified (2). Cell cultures are often contaminated with retrovirus particles, belonging to the family of viruses that include HIV (3). Cell culture lines often used in the production of human antibodies may contain viruses such as murine parvovirus (MVM) or cytomegalovirus (4). While this contamination has been greatly reduced since the requirement of strict characterization of cell culture lines and the careful screening of human plasma donors (3), the risk of low levels of contamination still exists.",

            "text": "The FDA requires that any process that uses materials from living sources must have two viral clearance steps to lower the risk of contamination (5). These steps must demonstrate a distinct mechanism of virus clearance and achieve a minimum of 4 log removal, or 99.99%. There are two broad categories for viral clearance, inactivation and removal (6). Inactivation is often performed toward the beginning of the purification of a therapeutic and could involve a lowering of pH or heating of the product. Both of these processes work well against enveloped viruses, but caution must be taken to not harm the desired protein product. Virus removal is often done at the end of a process and most commonly involves nanofiltration of the final product directly before formulation. Nanofiltration works well for viruses of large size. However, small viruses like parvoviruses are often of approximately the same size as the protein product, making it difficult to separate them by filtration (2). Complete removal of small non\u2010enveloped viruses with 20 nm pore size filters has been accomplished, but there is significant fouling of these small\u2010pored membranes that can lead to reductions in production rates (7, 8). Filtration of parvoviruses has been improved by flocculation of the virus particles through addition of cationic polymers (9) or amino acids (10), which allows the use of larger pore membranes that do not foul as quickly. Virus removal can also be accomplished using functionalized membrane surfaces. Quaternary amine groups have been attached to membrane surfaces to facilitate the removal of viruses through an ion exchange mechanism (11, 12, 13). Viral clearance validation may be achieved by conducting spiking experiments on normal process steps used in the purification of a therapeutic (i.e., chromatography columns, precipitation) (14), but care should be taken if a chromatography step is to be used concurrently as a viral clearance step and a protein purification step. If both the virus and the protein bind to the resin, it is possible for viruses to accumulate in the column. Without proper cleaning, the virus may elute from the column in subsequent batches and contaminate the therapeutic product (14).",

            "text": "Affinity adsorption is rarely used to remove viruses from process streams because the most common affinity ligands for viruses are antibodies. Antibodies are expensive to produce, often cannot withstand the harsh conditions required for the cleaning of process equipment, and carry an inherent risk of being contaminated with viruses in their own right (3). However, affinity adsorption has been applied to the reduction of infectious prions from blood (15, 16), and a small peptide ligand has been found to remove staphylococcal enterotoxin B, a small toxin, from E. coli lysate (17). Small peptides are more robust than antibodies, and they are also less expensive and can be chemically synthesized, eliminating the risk of virus contamination. Peptides can handle the cycling of production and cleaning much better than antibodies, and by using small peptides, there is no three\u2010dimensional structure that may be destroyed during processing. In this work, several trimeric peptides have been discovered that remove PPV from phosphate buffered saline containing as high as 7.5% human blood plasma. The peptides were found when a synthetic, solid\u2010phase combinatorial library was screened for ligands that bind to porcine parvovirus (PPV). Solid\u2010phase libraries allow screening directly on the chromatographic support that will be used as the separation media and have been successful in the discovery of many affinity peptide ligands (18, 19, 20, 21). The discovered peptides can completely remove any detectable PPV from PBS and completely remove any detectable PPV from the first 3 column volumes when 7.5% human plasma is present. This work demonstrates that small peptides may offer a novel and effective method for removing viruses from complex mixtures.",

The library was swelled in 20% methanol in DI water overnight and then buffer exchanged with PBS three times, with the last buffer exchange being overnight. Ten milligrams of dry library was taken and mixed with 50% human blood plasma in PBS for 1 h. 35S\u2010Labeled PPV was added to the library at 10,000 CPM (about 1 \u00d7 10\u2212\n3 \u03bcCi) and allowed to equilibrate for about 1.5 h. The library was then placed in a disposable 10 mL fritted column (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The beads were washed with PBS followed by PBS containing an additional 1 M NaCl or KCl until no radioactivity could be detected from the wash. The beads were washed again in PBS to remove excess salt and then put into 20 mL of 1% low melt agarose (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). This was poured onto a 160 mm \u00d7 180 mm GelBond (BioWhittaker Inc, Walkersville, MD) and allowed to dry for 3 days. Kodak BioMax MR Film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) was placed onto the dried gel for 10 days and developed with a Konica Medical Film Processor (Tokyo, Japan). A proprietary ligand found by the American Red Cross that binds to PPV (positive control) and a negative control of Amino 650M were used as markers to line up the film and the gel for visualization of radioactive beads. Positive beads were excised from the gel, boiled in water for 10 min each, and vortexed and the water changed for a total of three repeats to remove the agarose and the bound PPV from the beads. The beads then were sent to the Texas A&M Protein Laboratory (College Station, TX) for sequencing by Edman degradation.",

Each of these peptide ligands were selected from a hexamer library, which contains over 34 million different combinations, when 18 of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids are used for library production. It would take a tremendous amount of effort to screen all of these sequences, and it is not necessary when purification is the intended use of the ligand. In general, a purification ligand is useful if it can bind over 90% of the target protein and is specific enough to produce an eluted protein that is 80\u221290% pure, but for virus removal, the goal is reduction of \u226599.99% of a virus, which is at femtomolar to picomolar concentrations. To improve the possibility of finding a ligand that can accomplish this, a trimeric library was designed and screened. This library contained only 5832 different sequences and could be screened many times over to compare different screening conditions. Further, by screening the entire library, there was a greater probability that one or more strongly binding ligands would be found, which would not necessarily occur with a hexamer library.",

This spacer arm separated the peptide approximately 15 \u00c5 from the undisclosed spacer on the Toyopearl resin. It has also been shown that hydrophilic ethylene glycol does not bind proteins and makes a flexible yet inert spacer arm that allows movement of the ligand, improving binding (27, 28, 29). A surface map of PPV shows that there are canyons on the surface of the virus that are approximately 15 \u00c5 in depth (30), and so the spacer arm was designed to allow the peptide to reach into the depths of the canyons.

This blocked any of the peptides that had a high affinity for plasma proteins before the addition of PPV to the library. After incubation with PPV, the beads were washed to remove any nonspecifically bound virus. One screening run was washed in 1 M NaCl and yielded a total of 24 positive beads from about 10,000; another screening run was washed in 1 M KCl and gave a total of 9 positive beads. Only those positive beads that had a large signal to size ratio (i.e., a small bead that gave a large signal), as determined by visual inspection, were chosen for sequencing. The results of the returned sequences are shown in Table 1. To better determine the significance of the different chemical groups, the amino acids were counted and compared to their probability of random occurrence (Table 2). A random occurrence was determined as the number of amino acids in the chemical group divided by the number of different amino acids in the library and then multiplied by the total number of amino acids found from the sequencing. For example, there are five different aliphatic amino acids, so the random number of aliphatic amino acids is calculated by dividing 5 amino acids the by the 18 different amino acids used in this study, and the result multiplied by the 48 total amino acids in the 16 trimers found by screening. This gives the random occurrence of aliphatic amino acids of 13.3 indicated in Table 2. If the number of amino acids from a certain chemical group was close to the random occurrence number, then it was suspected that the chemical group was just randomly found and may have little to do with the binding of the virus. However, if the number was much higher than that expected to occur randomly, then that group was considered to be significant in the binding of the virus.",

In fact, microfiltration is being considered as an alternative to chlorine treatment of water supplies (32), but the method suffers from many of the same difficulties as nanofiltration for therapeutic processes. Small viruses, like hepatitis A virus, which has a diameter of 27\u221232 nm (33), and norovirus, with a diameter of 30\u221240 nm (34), are able to pass through many nanofiltration and all microfiltration membranes. These viruses are shed in the feces of infected humans and are common contaminants of water supplies. Small peptide ligands theoretically could be placed on microfiltration membranes to improve virus removal without the need to use membranes of small pore size which often cause fouling (8) and may require high back pressures.",

There are two general viral clearance steps in a monoclonal antibody production process, i.e., a low pH step after cell harvest and a nanofiltration step before or during formulation (35).

In the first two column volumes in PBS and 7.5% human blood plasma, the amino control achieved about 1 log clearance. This is not surprising, as anion exchange columns are often tested for their ability to clear viruses (35). It has been shown that a Q\u2010Sepharose column was able to clear 3 log of PPV when loaded at pH 6.5 (36) and as high as 5 log of MVM when loaded in Tris buffer at pH 8.0 (14). This follows the trend that increasingly basic solutions will make the virus surface more negatively charged, which would cause increasingly stronger binding of the virus to an anion exchange column. The control in our experiments was a weak ion\u2010exchange resin at pH 7.4, which showed clearance lower than that seen with the Q\u2010Sepharose columns, as would be expected.",

The PPV solution used in the experiments was cell culture supernatant that had been clarified by low\u2010speed centrifugation and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and so the solution contained cellular debris. Since the amino control is a weak ion\u2010exchange resin, it is possible that the resin was binding the cellular debris, and the virus then bound to the debris on the resin, as many proteins in host cell proteins are known to be negatively charged and removed by anion exchange (35). Since the amino resin has a high positive charge density, it is also possible that these cellular proteins may denature onto the surface, as has been suspected in ion exchange purification (37, 38) and is known to happen when proteins adsorb to surfaces (39). Protein denaturation was also a possibility, as this was observed in the purification of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 using an ion exchange column (37). The longer these host cell proteins are retained on the column, the greater the potential for protein denaturation, and this may provide different binding sites for the virus. Virus binding to host cell proteins is confirmed by the fact that when highly purified virus suspensions containing less than 100 \u03bcg/mL of total protein are used in resin challenge, the amino control resin binds no more than 1 log of PPV even after 10 column volumes (data not shown). Viruses are also known to easily aggregate (40), and so the presence of denatured protein could become a new binding surface for the virus.",

With optimization of the peptide density and spacer length, this resin may be able to clear PPV in all nine column volumes of challenge solution containing 7.5% human blood plasma. Human blood plasma also contains many different proteins, and only one or two may be interfering with the binding of PPV. For example, if albumin is the predominant protein binding to the resin, then the peptide may be able to clear PPV very well from a solution that contains other proteins but not albumin.

The viruses, having a diameter on the same order of magnitude as the pore diameter, have small diffusion coefficients in the pores of the beads, and viruses quickly clog the pores. Consequently, the accessible surface area of the beads is mainly associated with the outside surface of the bead, and the inner pore surface is not available for binding. Membranes have a better geometry for binding of particles such as viruses, as there are not any diffusional limitations. However, the screening of a combinatorial library of peptides is difficult to do on a membrane surface. The SPOT method, developed by Ronald Frank (41), is used to produce peptide libraries on a cellulose membrane surface, but if done manually, only several hundreds of peptides can be created in 2\u22123 days (42). This is a small library compared to the thousands of peptides that can be screened on chromatographic beads. In addition, the binding to a peptide on cellulose fibers may be quite different from that observed on other membrane materials. There are currently no large ligand libraries on any membrane surface that is likely to be used for large\u2010scale virus removal. This study provides proof\u2010of\u2010concept that peptides have the ability to remove viruses specifically. In the future, it may be beneficial to change the geometry of the support for improved access of all of the ligands to the viral particle, but currently the bead geometry offers a better screening platform.",

In PBS, 100% of detectable infectious virus was removed from solution for every fraction that was tested, up to nine column volumes. This demonstrates the potential of these peptides for use in virus removal from samples of relatively simple composition, such as for water purification applications. In more complex mixtures, such as 7.5% human blood plasma, peptide WRW was able to remove all detectable infectious viruses in the first three column volumes. This is impressive for a ligand that contains only three amino acids, as most peptide ligands are a minimum of six amino acids in length. Enhanced specificity and binding affinity may be found using an increased number of amino acids in the ligand, and this is currently being examined. Tethering one or more of the ligands to a membrane with more suitable geometry may improve virus removal efficiency from complex mixtures. The ligands could also be optimized for application to specific process streams, so that a single ligand must only compete with one therapeutic protein, thereby overcoming competitive binding and facilitating use as an efficient virus absorbent.",
