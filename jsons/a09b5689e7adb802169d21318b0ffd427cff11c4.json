            "text": "The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation policies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. Since there exist several non-pharmaceutical strategies to resort to, we need to assess their efficiency for thwarting the pandemic impact. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized policy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) policy is the most efficient isolation at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that a moderate social distancing, e.g., cutting 50% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak impact by 47% for the C isolation, and by 31% for the D isolation. A stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have dangerous effects. Thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space (i.e., networkcentric analysis of isolation strategies), and time (i.e., delayed application of isolation strategies). We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period.",

[21] simulate an influenza model on a community representative of a small town in the United States and show that social distancing would be necessary though school closures and home isolation. For more infectious strains, they found that increased levels of quarantine are needed. Valdez et al. [22] adopt an intermittent social distancing strategy to disturb the epidemic spreading process on different complex network topologies. Specifically, a susceptible individual is allowed to interrupt the contact with an infected neighbor based on a probability value. Using percolation theory, the authors find a critical threshold beyond which the epidemic disappears. Reluga et al. [19] employ game theory to estimate the social behavior of individuals when adopting social distancing during an outbreak. They find that the individual adopts a prophylactic behavior only after the epidemic begins and ceases before the epidemic ends. Additionally, the reproduction number R t must exceed a certain threshold for individuals to feel that social distancing is worth the effort. In contrast, our work studies global, local, and hybrid social distancing strategies to assess their effectiveness in controlling the COVID-19 dynamics.",

Node A is still not aware that it became a disease carrier, nor that it has infected his neighbors. After a delay of \u03b4 Aware days, node A becomes aware of its infectious condition (or state). At this point, nodes B and C know that A is a threat, but are unaware if they have contacted the disease. In the same manner, nodes B and C become contagious, then aware. Nodes D and E are further infected, and the process continues similarly. After \u03b4 Removal days (measured individually for each infected node), every node changes to one of three states: recovered (B, E), dead (C, D), or susceptible (A). The susceptible node A may start the same process all over again, going through all the SICARS states. Figure 2 : Example of an outbreak process according to our SICARS model, when used over a hypothetical contact network with five nodes (A-E), starting with infected node A. After an incubation period, node A becomes contagious and may infect neighbors B and C at any time. Likewise, node C enters the incubation phase and then becomes contagious for nodes D and E. Both contagious and aware states are infectious states, during which a node may spread the disease. Only when a node becomes aware may isolation strategies be applied to it. Finally, all nodes evolve towards one of two states: susceptible or removed (with the mutually exclusive sub-states recovered or dead).",

By setting e = 0.5, we show that the C isolation removes about 50% of edges in the entire network, regardless of the node states (hence, all nodes are colored gray in Figure 3a ); this process is applied synchronously over the entire network. The DA and DI isolation, on the other hand, work asynchronously, and depend on the (local) development of the disease in the vicinity of each node. In case of DA, pictured in Figure 3b , only when a node becomes aware (orange) can it self-isolate by cutting edges in its vicinity (green nodes). In case of DI, pictured in Figure 3c , a susceptible node (green) can only isolate itself from infected neighbors once these become aware (orange), i.e., visibly infected. Finally, in case of the combined C+D strategy, we simply apply C followed by DA and DI independently on the network. Figure 3 : Example of applying the C, DA, and DI isolation strategies over a small example contact network using an edge removal ratio e = 0.5. (a) For C isolation, any edge will be removed with a 50% probability, regardless of the state of any node. (b) For DA isolation, each node that becomes aware will cut all edges in its vicinity with a probability given by e; in this example, node A removes 3 out of its 6 adjacent edges. (c) For DI isolation, each susceptible (healthy) node which detects an aware (i.e., sick) neighbor, will try to detach from it with a given probability e; in this example, node S manages to detach itself from sick nodes A 2 and A 3 .",

Note that the use of these topologies is not an attempt to replace the realistic contact networks, but rather to validate the accuracy and the consistent dynamics of the SICARS model on several different types of graphs. We also include several sizable real-world network datasets, which present a variety of heterogeneous social interaction networks: the Enron email communication network (Em) [37] , the Brightkite location-based social network (Bk) [38] , and the Epinions trust network (Ep) [39] . The reason for choosing these specific datasets is that from a statistics standpoint, they hold characteristics representative for the contact network enabling epidemic spreading. In particular, Em models relevant professional contacts and Ep models relevant friendship contacts. These connections are the most likely to be activated in the real-world social networks.

After applying the C isolation on the Em network (i.e., removing 50% of network edges), we measure a constant density \u03c1(t) = 0.0001.

Indeed, many real-world networks possess a power-law distribution of nodes degree, thus favoring the formation of hubs [43, 36] . These hubs have a significant accelerating effect on the diffusion of innovation, ideas, as well as epidemics [9, 42, 44] ; this is why these hubs are called superspreaders. During an outbreak, it becomes paramount to reduce the connectivity of these superspreaders because a single infected hub can exceed the combined adverse effects of many average or low connected nodes.",

Specifically, the C strategy (red line) reduces the maximum degree to 50% of the initial network's maximum degree (i.e., given by e = 0.5) from the very beginning (d = 0) of the simulation. The DA and DI isolation strategies (blue lines) have a delay of \u2248 d = 36 \u2212 37 days until the network responds; after this moment, DI only reduces the maximum degree to about 62%, while DA reduces it significantly, to only 3%. Finally, the hybrid C+D isolation carries a signature that indicates the highest efficiency; namely, the reduction to 50% is obtained at d = 0, followed by a reduction to 3%, similar to the DA strategy delay.

We analyze next the efficiency of all isolation strategies in the context of a delayed implementation of quarantines/lockdowns. To this end, we compare three scenarios when the same strategies are applied with a delay of d = {0, 20, 30, 50} days after the initial outbreak. The simulation results in Figure 10a suggest that governments/authorities should take an immediate action to enforce the isolation strategies. In general, for moderate isolation (e = 0.5), the outbreak amplitude increases significantly with the delay (Figure 10a) ; thus, for a delay of d = 20 days (yellow line) we observe a +8% higher infection ratio, for d = 30 days (green line) we observe a +24% higher infection ratio , and for d = 50 (blue line) the results are alarming with +76% more infections than the immediate response (red line). A more severe isolation (e = 0.75) further amplifies the effects of the delaying isolation strategies, compared to the moderate isolation. As such, for the same delays, we measure increases in the infection ratio of +41% (yellow dotted line), 3.4\u00d7 (green dotted line), respectively 3.88\u00d7 higher (blue dotted line) compared to an immediate response (red dotted line).

In other words, some governments are reacting to the accelerated outbreak spread by adopting increasingly more severe quarantine measures as time goes by. In contrast to the proactive isolation (meaning that a fixed e is imposed from a specific moment in time), we model the reactive policy by progressively increasing the strength of isolation, from e = 0 to e = 0.8, at fixed moments in time. As such, we analyze two realistic scenarios for adopting a progressive policy. First, the edge removal ratio is increased as a delayed reaction to the pandemic spreading, with values e = {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}, applied at moments r 1 = {10, 20, 40, 60} (faster reaction). Second, the reaction happens at moments r 2 = {20, 40, 60, 80} (slower reaction). This means that, for example, during the first 20 days of the r 2 progressive policy, we have no isolation at all (i.e., e = 0); after day d = 20, e is increased to e = 0.2, and so on.",

Additionally, the r 2 policies is similar to C isolation with e = 0.25 (point A). In other words, if a government reacts slowly, by progressive increases of isolation severity (e.g., policy r 2 ) up to e = 0.8, the result will be the same as if the government would have applied a more relaxed C isolation with e = 0.25 from the very beginning of the outbreak.",

Specifically, applying forms of moderate to strict quarantine can prolong the pandemic duration by roughly +40% (Hybrid C+D) and +80% (C) days, compared no isolation at all, where we estimate the duration of the pandemic at \u2248 100 days. Indeed, while a more extended quarantine may have complex economic consequences, the invaluable benefit of applying isolation strategies is the significant reduction of the peak infection ratio, and implicitly a reduction of casualties.",

Panel 13a highlights the reduced efficiency of the DA and DI isolation when removing 50% of social ties. Compared to the no isolation case, DA and DI manage to reduce the infection amplitude by only 39%. In contrast, the efficiency of the C isolation grows roughly linearly with e, while the hybrid C+D isolation yields the best results (71% infection reduction). A more strict restriction might be necessary for COVID-19, meaning a reduction of up to 75% social ties, as depicted in panel 13b. In this case, the efficiency of the C isolation remains proportional to e (75%), while the combined C+D isolation offers the most significant infection amplitude reduction of 87%. Our experimental results suggest that by further restricting the quarantine to e = 0.9, we can achieve a 98% reduction in outbreak impact, comparable to the 99.3% results obtained on the Singapore population [14] . Figure 13 : Efficiency of isolation strategies, in terms of the relative infection ratio reduction, compared to the baseline case of no isolation (given as percentage next to each corresponding isolation strategy) when the isolation strategy removes 50% of social ties from the network (moderate isolation) (a), 75% of social ties (severe isolation) (b).",

First, due to the small scale and high connectivity of these contact networks, the isolation strategies have little efficiency in defending against the COVID-19 spreading. We believe that the specific duration from contact to symptom onset, characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, renders any measures almost useless in such small communities. The maximum possible reduction of infection ratio of 4-14% is obtained only for the most severe isolation (e = 0.9). Second, we observe a lengthening of the outbreak duration (by 14 days), similar to the one visible on the large scale test networks. Third, we conclude that the topologies of contact networks are representative only for micro-scale communities (e.g., the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, or the Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier docked in Guam), and may not be directly extrapolated at the level of large cities, regions, or countries, as is the case of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
