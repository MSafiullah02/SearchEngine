            "text": "A quest for clean serum specimens to detect immunological responses to the presence of important pathogens has characterised the history of disease testing in veterinary medicine. Serum has traditionally been preferred over whole blood to decrease non-specific reactions, and give more accurate and reliable results. Assays such as the complement fixation test, dating from the very beginning of the last century (Bialynicki-Birula, 2008), agar gel immune-diffusion test (Ouchterlony, 1948), radioimmunoassay (Yalow and Berson, 1960) and immunofluorescence antibody testing (Voller, 1964) were some of the first tests used. In more recent years, ELISA (Engvall, Perlmann, 1971, Van Weemen, Schuurs, 1971) in its various permutations (direct, indirect, competitive, sandwich, capture) has been able to detect either antibody or antigen, and is popular because it is simple, inexpensive and rapid.",

Other readily obtainable body fluids, excretions or tissues could be obtained by less skilled personnel or animal owners to save on collection costs. In the human diagnostic field there is currently significant interest in exploring alternative specimen analysis such as dried blood spot testing for the diagnosis of hepatitis C (Coats and Dillon, 2015).",

            "text": "Milk can be a suitable medium for animal disease testing as it is generally easy to obtain (often without any specialised equipment), and in dairy cattle it is often available throughout the year. Using milk as a specimen, a wide range of animal diseases can be tested for in individual animals and in pooled specimens from herds. Tests for antibodies against the following pathogens are available: Brucella abortus (Nielsen and Gall, 2001), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV; Lanyon et al., 2014b), enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV1; Reber et al., 2012), Neospora caninum (Schares et al, 2004, Hall et al, 2006), liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica; Reichel et al., 2005), Johne's disease (Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis; MAP; Collins et al., 2005) and Ostertagia ostertagi (Charlier et al, 2005, Forbes et al, 2008) in cattle. Single animal testing can be performed and tank milk from herds of dairy cows is a ready-made pool for testing groups of animals. Tank milk presents a natural pool of animal biological specimens that, with adequate test analytical sensitivity, enables the tester to screen large numbers of animals for the presence or absence of disease. While testing for EBL by antibody ELISA, milk pools rarely exceeded 100\u2013200 cows (Ridge and Galvin, 2005), but PCR testing for BVDV is now routinely performed on pools in excess of 400 because high test analytical sensitivity provides a very cost-effective way of screening large herds and, more broadly, whole dairy industry. Herds of >400 cows are typical for the New Zealand dairy industry (Hill et al., 2010).",

If antibody to B. abortus was present, an antibody\u2013antigen complex was formed, adhering to milk fat globules and rising to the surface of the milk as a coloured ring (Fleischhauer, 1955). False positive results for B. abortus antibody can occur in cattle vaccinated against B. abortus <4 months prior to testing, or in milk containing colostrum or from cows with mastitis. Infection with other pathogens, such as Yersinia enterocolitica, can also cause non-specific positive reactions (Kittelberger et al., 1997). Comparable results are obtainable with the fluorescence polarisation assay (Nielsen and Gall, 2001), and this newer test can be used in the field.",

Antibodies formed against BVDV are excreted into milk and correlate well with serum antibody titres. Pooled testing provides a quantitative ELISA assessment strongly correlated with within-herd prevalence (Lanyon et al., 2014b). High levels of antibody in the tank milk suggest sufficient exposure to virus to reduce the need for vaccination, while low tank milk antibody levels suggest the need for biosecurity measures or vaccination to prevent infection. The ability to monitor the relative changes in pooled antibody levels, and therefore, within-herd prevalence is particularly valuable. A sudden increase may be indicative of a recent incursion of infection, a change that can be difficult and expensive to detect when relying on individual animal testing, and would suggest the need for further investigation, beginning with bulk milk PCR testing.",

Its availability is restricted to a shorter time period, but provides other testing and diagnostic advantages. Testing colostrum for antibodies (as an alternative or add-on to milk testing) is potentially useful because of the higher concentration of immunoglobulins in colostrum compared to milk. The concentration of IgG is estimated to be up to 100 times higher than milk in the first few days after parturition (Korhonen et al., 2000). Recent work in cattle suggests that testing colostrum increases analytical and diagnostic sensitivity compared to milk. This could be most useful for on-going surveillance of animal diseases requiring less frequent checks, as colostrum is only available during the perinatal period (Jenvey et al, 2012, Jenvey et al, 2015, Cockcroft et al, 2014).",

In this campaign, detection of BVDV antigen in skin was the specimen of choice to identify persistently infected calves, and was preferred over serum. After the ingestion of colostrum, maternal anti-BVDV antibodies can bind to BVDV antigen and prevent its successful detection in the routinely used antigen-capture ELISA (Fux and Wolf, 2012). Using ear notch skin specimens reduces this complication, as there are fewer antibodies in ear notch tissue. Heating of serum specimens under specific conditions to break up antibody-antigen complexes can overcome the interference of maternal antibody and allow successful serum testing. This adds extra steps to the procedure, but has been used effectively in BVDV testing (Lanyon and Reichel, 2016) and in heartworm serology (Little et al, 2014a, Little et al, 2014b, Velasquez et al, 2014).",

A conjunctival swab tested by PCR had the highest sensitivity compared to immunofluorescent antibody and lymph node microscopy for the diagnosis of Leishmania, but still only detected 74% of infected dogs (Di Muccio et al., 2012). Screening bats for lyssavirus with PCR using oropharyngeal swabs was more accurate than PCR of fresh brain (Echevarria et al., 2001), and could be performed antemortem. Combination PCR testing of oropharyngeal swabs and either conjunctival or nasal swabs were needed to identify all cats infected with B. bronchiseptica, FHV-1, C. felis, FCV, and M. felis in one study (Litster et al., 2015), but a single PCR test could be performed on both specimens. One-step multiplex PCR testing of nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from cattle for BoHV1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 was more sensitive than virus isolation and had a sensitivity of 97% in another study (Thonur et al., 2012).",

Subsequent studies found there was cross reaction between C. fetus spp. venerealis and Campylobacter hyointestinalis (Spence et al., 2011), illustrating the need for additional confirmatory testing of any PCR positive C. fetus spp. venerealis isolates. Improved sensitivity in detecting Tritrichomonas fetus in smegma and vaginal mucous was demonstrated using PCR (McMillen and Lew, 2006) compared to culture. Quantitative PCR testing for Ureaplasma diversum was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR (Marques et al., 2013). In addition, buccal swabs can also be collected to test for a range of inherited diseases including collie eye anomaly (Chang et al., 2010), hereditary cataract (Mellersh et al., 2006), and ceroid lipofuscinosis in dogs (Karli et al., 2014). Collie eye anomaly can be diagnosed by examination of the retinas in 5\u201310 week old puppies, but after 12 weeks this is impossible as the lesions become covered with pigment. Saliva collected onto filter paper from Collie-related breeds of dog of any age can rapidly be tested for the anomaly with the cost effective SYBR green method (Chang et al., 2010) allowing for large scale screening of populations. Saliva can also be collected for real time PCR testing for ceroid lipofuscinosis in dogs (Mizukami et al., 2011), providing early opportunities for diagnosis rather than waiting for the onset of clinical signs and confirmation by histopathology.",

For example, for F. hepatica, serological tests perform very well, demonstrating high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (Reichel, 2002) and the detection of antibodies confirms previous exposure to the parasite with high accuracy. However, antibodies may persist for weeks after an infection has been eliminated by effective treatment with a flukicide. In order to detect patent infections (with shedding), faecal (copro)-antigen ELISAs have successfully been deployed to detect active, patent infections with a high degree of diagnostic sensitivity (and perfect specificity; Palmer et al., 2014), thus giving an indication of current infection. Similarly, the application of diagnostic assays to detect the presence of nematode larvae and eggs in faeces presents new options for investigation of the parasite infection status of sheep and cattle, using a combined microscopy-molecular technique where parasite eggs are separated from faeces by a salt flotation technique before PCR testing to identify the species present (Bott et al, 2009, Hoglund et al, 2013). This avoids the need for time-consuming larval culture and identification.",

            "text": "Pooling of specimens can be used to provide information about immunological reactions to specific pathogens, or to identify pathogens or reagents of interest. Often this method is used for economic reasons; testing a large number of pooled specimens with one test is generally far cheaper than testing each animal individually. This is the case where the additional individual diagnostic test adds considerable cost, but the specimen is relatively cheap and readily available (e.g. milk). Pooled specimen testing is particularly useful as a screening test for the absence of disease or where disease prevalence is low. While pooling offers a method of investigating the disease status of a large population quickly (Lanyon et al., 2014a), there are two points important to note. Firstly, when testing for the presence of a condition/factor or pathogen, pooling only makes sense if it makes testing more cost-effective or less time-consuming than individual testing. If the prevalence of the factor of interest is higher than the dilution factor caters for, all pools will be positive, and nothing has been gained. For example, if you pool 20 animals/pool for BVDV virus testing and the disease prevalence in the population is 1\u20132%, 80% of pools are likely to screen negative, saving time and money. However, if you test 100 specimens/pool from the same population, all pools are likely to be positive, and you are no closer to identifying which animals are infected. By contrast, a run of 100 specimens is within the analytical capability of a PCR assay. Secondly, the diagnostic test also needs to possess sufficient analytical sensitivity to detect the antibody or antigen at the dilution factor determined by the degree of pooling. Usually an additional safety factor is added to ensure this. When testing for antibodies to EBL, the greatest dilution allowed for pooling is 10 times less than the highest dilution of a standard positive that can be detected e.g. if the standard can be detected diluted 1:100, pools of 10 animals each can be tested (Reichel et al., 1998).",

Hence, pooling generally indicates the level of infection or immunity at the herd, flock or unit level. For example, when testing for BVDV antibodies by ELISA, a single strong positive individual can result in a positive result in a pool of up to 128 individuals, while even a weak positive individual can cause a positive result in a pool of eight (Lanyon et al., 2014a). On the other hand, pooling provides a very cost-effective snapshot of that herd, flock or unit and can, if interpreted appropriately and used in conjunction with antibody and pathogen testing, can provide a very effective ongoing surveillance tool to augment biosecurity.",
