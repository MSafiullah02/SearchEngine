SARS-CoV particles contain a single positive-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 30 kb in length and has a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 poly(A) tract [8], [9], [10]. The SARS-CoV genome encodes for replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. The replicase gene encodes two large overlapping polypeptides (replicase 1a and 1ab, \u223c450 and \u223c750 kDa, respectively), including 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and RNA helicase for viral replication and transcription [11]. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, playing an important role in viral replication. Eleven cleavage sites of the 3CLpro on the viral polyprotein have been mapped using the computer prediction based on the substrate conservation among CoV main proteases [12], being confirmed by the in vitro trans-cleavage of 11 substrate peptides [13]. Therefore, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro becomes an attractive target for developing effective drugs against SARS.",

For the cis-cleavage assay, the in-frame construction of the 3CLpro, the substrate-II (S-II, SAVLQSGFRK), and the luciferase (Luc) was transfected into the Vero cells. In addition, the mutations at the substrate conserved residues Leu and Gln were performed for the examination of the substrate specificity. In this study, the in vitro trans-cleavage and cell-based cis-cleavage activities of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro had been determined using the quantitative methods of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and a Luc assay, which will be useful for large-scale screening of inhibitors against SARS.",

The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 100 \u03bcl of diluted anti-HSV mAb (Novagen) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Following each incubation and subsequent layer of the ELISA, the wells were washed three times with TBST. After blocking by incubation with 5% skimmed milk in TBST for 2 h at room temperature (200 \u03bcl/well), 100 \u03bcl of the mixture containing the S-I/nsp7 fusion protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) and the 3CLpro (300 \u03bcg/ml) was added into anti-HSV mAb-coated wells for the 3-h incubation. The intact form of the S-I/nsp7 fusion protein was detected using the S protein conjugated to peroxidase (Novagen) for 1 h at room temperature. The ELISA products were developed with a chromogen solution containing 2,2\u2032-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and hydrogen peroxide. The relative trans-cleavage activity was calculated as 1 \u2212 \n(A4053CLpro)/(A405no 3CLpro).",

The forward primer mentioned above contained a BamHI restriction site and the reverse primer included an EcoRI restriction site and an in-frame gene encoding for the C-terminus of the 3CLpro and the S-II (SAVLQSGFRK). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Amersham). The resulting plasmid was named as Pro/S-II. Meanwhile, the substitutions of Leu and Gln in the S-II by alanine with the plasmid Pro/S-II were also constructed using the reverse primers 5\u2032-TGCAGAATTCTTTCCTAAAACCACTCTGCGCAACAGCAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGCAGAATTCTTTCCTAAAACCACTCGCCAGAACAGCAGA-3\u2032, which plasmids were designed as Pro/S-II(L \u2192 A) and Pro/S-II(Q \u2192 A), respectively.

The Luc gene was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction enzyme sites of the plasmids Pro/S-II, Pro/S-II(L \u2192 A) and Pro/S-II(Q \u2192 A). These recombinant plasmids were designed as Pro/S-II/Luc, Pro/S-II(L \u2192 A)/Luc and Pro/S-II(Q \u2192 A)/Luc for detecting the cis-acting proteolytic activity of the 3CLpro in Vero cells. Vero cells at 60\u201390% confluency in 6-well plates were transfected with 5 \u03bcg of total plasmids (0.5 \u03bcg of the indicated expression vector pEGFP-N1 plus 4.5 \u03bcg of pcDNA3.1), Pro/S-II, Pro/S-II/Luc, Pro/S-II(L \u2192 A)/Luc or Pro/S-II(Q \u2192 A)/Luc, using the GenePorter reagent. According to the manufacturer's direction (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA), the transfected cells were maintained in 2 ml of Dulbeccos modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% bovine serum (FBS) after 5-h incubation with the mixture of the plasmid DNA and GenePorter reagent. Transfected cells were selected using the DMEM containing 10% FBS and 800 \u03bcg/ml of G418 for one month, and then G418-resistant cell clones were confirmed by the expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Firefly Luc activity in the transfected cells was measured using the dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Luminometer TROPIX TR-717 (Applied Biosystems).",

The S-I was fused in-frame with a Nus-Tag and an S-Tag at the N-terminus and the nsp7 and an HSV-Tag at the C-terminus (Fig. 1A). According to the structure knowledge [17], mutations of His-41 by Ala (H41A), Cys-145 by Ala (C145A), and Glu166 by Arg (E166R) within the substrate-binding site SI were also performed and tested the effects on the enzyme activity. The trans-cleavage of the S-I/nsp7 fusion protein (Nus Tag/S-Tag/S-I/nsp7/HSV-Tag) by the 3CLpro and the mutants was analyzed using the Western blotting with the S-protein conjugated to peroxidase. An immuno-band for the cleavage product, the Nus Tag/S-Tag protein, was detected in the trans-cleavage by 3CLpro, but not in the reactions by the 3CLpro mutants H41A, C145A, and E166R (data not shown). For quantification of the in vitro trans-cleavage, the mixture of the 3CLpro and the S-I/nsp7 fusion protein was incubated in the anti-HSV mAb-coated wells. Subsequently, the non-cleavage form of the S-I/nsp7 fusion protein was captured and then detected using the ELISA with the S-protein conjugated to peroxidase (Fig. 3\n). The relative trans-cleavage ability revealed that the 3CLpro mutants H41A, C145A, and E166R lose more than 50% activity compared to the wild type 3CLpro. Furthermore, the enzyme activity of the 3CLpro was significantly inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ABF) (Fig. 3). These results demonstrated the trans-cleavage specificity of the 3CLpro and the importantly functional role of the residues His41, Cys145, and Glu166 within the substrate-binding site S1.",

Since the fusion of the firefly Luc with a more than 30 kDa protein fused as the N-terminus resulted in a dramatic decrease of Luc activity [18], the detection of Luc activity could be referred to the measurement of the cis-cleavage by the SARS-CoV 3CLpro.

            "text": "The identified cleavage site of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains a LQA(S,N) motif recognized by most other CoV proteases [12], [21], which leads us to suggest that the proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins could be similar to those of other CoVs, such as HCoV and TGEV. Based on the conserved LQA(S,N) motif, Leu-P2 and Gln-P1 were selected for mutational analysis of the substrate specificity by the 3CLpro. Alanine substitution at Leu-P2 and Gln-P1 revealed that Gln-P1 dominantly determined the cleavage efficiency of the substrates by the SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Fig. 4G). We will further characterize the substrate specificity by the systematically mutational analysis for the molecular-based design on the anti-SARS drugs.",

Furthermore, the Luc activity referred to the cell-based cis-cleavage activity will be useful for the examination of the inhibitory effects on the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the Vero cells. Therefore, this study not only characterizes the molecular interaction of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with the substrates, but also provides reliable assays for screening the anti-SARS drugs.",
