            "text": "The ability to manipulate living organisms is at the heart of a range of emerging technologies that serve to address important and current problems in environment, energy, and health. However, with all its complexity and interconnectivity, biology has for many years been recalcitrant to engineering manipulations. The recent advances in synthesis, analysis, and modeling methods have finally provided the tools necessary to manipulate living systems in meaningful ways and have led to the coining of a field named synthetic biology. The scope of synthetic biology is as complicated as life itself-encompassing many branches of science and across many scales of application. New DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have made routine customization of very large DNA molecules. This in turn has allowed the incorporation of multiple genes and pathways. By coupling these with techniques that allow for the modeling and design of protein functions, scientists have now gained the tools to create completely novel biological machineries. Even the ultimate biological machinery-a self-replicating organism-is being pursued at this moment. The aim of this article is to dissect and organize these various components of synthetic biology into a coherent picture. \uf8e9",

Not surprisingly, synthetic biology means different things to different people, even to leading practitioners in the field. 1 To avoid possible confusion for the reader, here we would define it as 'deliberate design of improved or novel biological systems that draws on principles elucidated by biologists, chemists, physicists, and engineers'. It is true that scientists have been attempting to design biological systems for decades. However, synthetic biology has become a field of its own only recently, mostly driven by the advances in systems biology and the development of new powerful tools for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Synthetic biology has broad applications in medical, chemical, food, and agricultural industries. In addition to practical applications, synthetic biology also aims to increase our understanding of basic life sciences.",

Between 1970 and 2008, the size of DNA synthesized has increased from 75 to 582,970 bp. 13 The current record was set by the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in which the 583 kb Mycoplasma genitalium genome was constructed from 101 pieces of DNA fragments, each 5-6 kb in length. 14 Initially, synthesis was achieved in two steps: the first step involves multiple in vitro enzymatic recombination to create six large pieces of DNA, while the second step takes advantage of the in vivo yeast recombination mechanism to produce the final synthetic genome ( Figure 2 ). Later, the entire genome assembly process was simplified by directly assembling 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step in yeast. 15 A similar method called DNA assembler was developed by Shao and coworkers to assemble a biochemical pathway. 16 As proof of concept, a biochemical pathway consisting of eight genes (a total of \u223c19 kb) was assembled in a single step in yeast, resulting in a recombinant strain that could utilize d-xylose to produce a nutraceutical zeaxanthin.

[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] However, directed evolution has its own limitations too. For example, the use of microorganisms in directed evolution to link the protein activity with its genetic code imposes an upper limit on the protein variant library size that can be sieved through. This limit is generally lower than 10 10 , which is the potential library size that would be generated if a typical protein (300 amino acids) were to be diversified with three randomly introduced point mutations.

By fusing a library of promoters to the various enzymes in the isoprenoid production pathway, Pitera and coworkers have managed to engineer a flux-balanced pathway with improved yield and reduced metabolic burden. 30 These well-characterized families of transcription regulators have emerged as powerful tools in metabolic engineering as they allow rational coordination and control of multigene expression, thereby decoupling pathway design from construction. 31, 32 Pathway engineering tools are most directly relevant in biochemical production at the pathway level.",

Then, we will look at the pathway and network level, where basic functional units are integrated into pathways and networks that perform higher level functions. Moving higher, we will reach the cellular level, where an intricate biochemical network gives rise to a self-replicating entity-life.

When engineering non-natural nucleic acids, three design criteria need to be met, including the need to have some type of base pairing, compatibility with the natural or engineered DNA polymerase, and compatibility with RNA polymerase. 63 One of the objectives of using non-natural nucleic acids is to improve the stability of polynucleotides. The phosphodiester backbone of DNA is the attack site for enzymatic cleavage. By replacing the phosphate group of the nucleotides, the most common degradation site is thus eliminated. Examples include phosphorothioate, 64 boranophosphate, 65 and phosphonate. 66 Another objective of using nonnatural nucleic acids is to expand the number of base pairs.

First, there needs to be an amino-acyl transferase that charges a tRNA with an unnatural amino acid and, at the same time, act orthogonally to the host system. Then, the tRNA would have to recognize a unique codon that normally does not code for any amino acid. The selected codon is most often the UAG (amber) codon, while the tRNA and amino-acyl transferase pair is taken from a heterologous source to maintain orthogonality. All of the components are engineered to work together by protein engineering, mostly via the directed evolution approach. 69, 72 Over the years, a large number of amino acid analogs have been developed. Many of them have interesting properties such as fluorescence and photoregulation. 73, 74 In order to maximize the potential of non-natural proteins, we need to be able to specify more than one non-natural amino acid. To this end, a few strategies have been proposed and are currently being pursued. One of them is to expand the genetic code by introducing non-natural base pairs as mentioned earlier. Another is to use a quadruplet code for non-natural amino acids. 75 In order to create a ribosome that reads such a code, protein engineering is once again employed.",

When we use cells to detect molecules, we may want a 'yes or no' answer instead of an 'x relative to y' answer. For example, to tell if a neurological toxin is above a dangerous threshold, we would prefer a device that turns red when above threshold and colorless otherwise, as oppose to one that changes from colorless to pink to red as the concentration increases, which will require the user to differentiate between light red (below threshold) and red (above threshold). In a digital system, a variable has only two states and is therefore more tolerant to noise than in an analog system. However, the natural world is inherently analog. To interface the two systems, we need an analog-to-digital converter. Such a converter can be constructed using an array of toggle switches with increasing response threshold. 78 Other than direct applications, constructing gene circuits also allow scientists to understand the properties of nature's circuits. In a recent example, Cagatay and coworkers asked why nature picked a certain circuit design when there are others that are functionally equivalent. 79 By constructing the alternative circuit and comparing that to the wild type, they found that the wild type circuit is noisier, i.e., has more fluctuation, than the alternative. Further experiments then revealed that while the alternative circuit is more precise and is able to perform its function better in a specific environment, the noisy wild type circuit is able to perform its function over a wider range of environments. Thus in a changing environment similar to that of nature, a noisy and adaptable circuit is selected over a precise circuit.",

In biochemical production however, for example artemisinin (an anti-malarial drug), cells do not typically have the machineries for its production, and multiple enzymes need to be heterologously expressed to form a complete pathway. The unique challenges in such engineering efforts include balancing of promoter strengths, enzyme expression and coordination of expression, and interface with native metabolism. 2 The motivation behind using cells for biochemical production is different depending on the class of biochemicals produced. For specialty chemicals, the structure is sometimes so complex that chemical synthesis becomes prohibitively expensive, difficult, or both. In this case, the motivation of using the biological production route is to circumvent difficult chemistry. Well known for their specificity, enzymes can perform transformations that may take many more steps to accomplish through chemical synthesis. For bulk chemicals, where chemical synthesis is viable, the motivation of using the biological production route is cost and sustainability.

Through this series of engineering efforts, the production of amorphadiene was improved by more than 10 million-fold to 25 g/L in a fed-batch reactor. 80 Artemisinin can be chemically converted from either amorphadiene or artemisinic acid. Ethanol is a good example of a bulk chemical that is currently being produced in a biochemical process. Yeast, a natural producer of ethanol, is the logical biological catalyst. However, yeast has its limitations-it is unable to break down cellulose and hemicellulose, major components of biomass, and it is unable to utilize pentoses such as d-xylose and l-arabinose, which come from the breakdown of hemicellulose. Thus, engineering yeast to break down cellulose and hemicellulose and utilize all the sugars from their breakdown is currently a major research effort in the area of bioenergy. 81, 82 In order to endow yeast with the above functions, multiple enzymes and pathways need to be inserted and optimized. To break down cellulose to glucose, at least three classes of enzymes need to be introduced-namely cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase. To break down hemicellulose to its component sugars (including d-xylose and l-arabinose), at least four classes of enzymes need to be introduced-namely xylanase, xylosidase, glucuronidase, and arabinosidase. All these enzymes can be either secreted or surfaceanchored, and they need to be expressed in the right proportion for the best synergy.

So far, the whole genome synthesis of poliovirus, 1918 'Spanish' influenza virus, HIVcpz, coronavirus, and X174 have been achieved and proven infectious. 86 One immediate use of chemically synthesized viruses is in the area of vaccine production. It is now possible to make large-scale changes to a viral genome so as to attenuate its virulence. For example, codondeoptimization has led to a strain of virus that is phenotypically identical to its wild type cousin but is unable to replicate in the normal host because of multiple rare codon usage. 86 Szostak and coworkers have led a separate effort to create life in laboratory. The main motivation behind their work is to understand how a self-replicating organism can be formed from prebiotic chemistry-i.e., without the use of any enzymes, from simple organic molecules such as sugars, amino acids, nucleic acids, and fatty acids. Solving the mystery of life that has been created billions of years ago is a daunting task, and their work offers a plausible physical and chemical origin of life on earth. The non-enzymatic assembly and replication of lipid vesicles has already been demonstrated, while the non-enzymatic polymerization of nucleic acid is currently being attempted. 87",

Synthetic biology at the multi-cellular level is based on the same ideas: communication and division of labor. This approach of engineering is also called the consortium approach. Communication can be achieved either by the exchange of metabolites or dedicated signal molecules. For example, Balagadd\u00e9 and coworkers constructed a predator and prey bacterial ecosystem where the predator causes the prey to kill itself but at the same time requires signals from the prey to survive ( Figure 5 ). 88 The result is an expected predator and prey fluctuation in population. Communication has also been demonstrated between different domains of life, e.g., bacterial and mammalian cells. 89 Division of labor can make cellular engineering easier by reducing the metabolic load of individual FIGURE 5 | A synthetic predator-prey ecosystem. The system consists of two engineered bacterial populations that control each other's survival and death. CcdB is a cytotoxic protein that kills the cell and CcdA is its antidote. In the predator, CcdB is constitutively expressed, and will die off without an external signal. The antidote CcdA is expressed only when the predator receives signaling molecules (3OC6HSL) from the prey. At high enough prey concentration, the predator will survive. However, the prey also receives signaling molecules (3OC12HSL) from the predator. In the prey, CcdB is expressed in response to the predator signal. Therefore, in high enough predator concentration, the prey will die.",

When input concentration rises above its threshold, repressor 1 is expressed, switching the state of toggle switch 1 to 'on'.
