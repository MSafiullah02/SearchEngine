            "text": "The genus of Narcissus L. belonging to the subfamily Amaryllidoideae is one of the fifteen genera of the Amaryllidaceae family, which contains 80 to 100 wild species of perennial bulbiferous geophytes (Berkov et al. 2009; Hanks 2002). The genus is widely distributed in the southwest of Europe, with the Iberian Peninsula diversity center (Spain and Portugal) and North Africa (Ito et al. 1999). Few species of Narcissus have been developed in France and Italy, and some are found in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean regions (Hanks 2002). The genus members are commonly known as daffodil, daffadowndilly, narcissus, and jonquil throughout the world. Narcissus tazetta L. is an indigenous ornamental and fragrant plant species that is distributed from Portugal to Turkey. The plant is also growing from central to eastern Asia (Berkov et al. 2009; Hanks 2002). Indigenous habitats of Narcissus species are diverse and include a range of low-lying lands to mountainous areas as well as lawns, shrubs, forests, and cliffs (Hanks 2002). The genus Narcissus and the other genera of Amaryllidaceae family i.e., Ungernia Bunge, Leucojum L., Galanthus L., Zephyranthes Herb., Hymenocallis Salisb., and Haemanthus L. are well-known alkaloid-containing plants, due to the presence of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) including lycorin, crinine, hemanthamine, narciclasine, galantamine, tazettine, homolycorine, montanine, and norbelladine which form an entirely different taxonomic and chemical group (Bastida et al. 2006; Torras-Claveria et al. 2013).",

GAL can cross from the blood-brain barrier and effect on the central nervous system (Bastida et al. 2006; Ghosal et al. 1990). Due to the ability of GAL to enhance central cholinergic function, it has been introduced in Europe to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) since 1980 (Bores and Kosley 1996). GAL-hydrobromide as a superior pharmaceutical profile has a higher tolerance to the major AChE inhibitors, including physostigmine or tacrine, and is currently used in the United States under the name Razadine\u00ae, known as Reminyl\u00ae, to treat certain stages of AD (Grutzendler and Morris 2001; Heinrich and Teoh 2004). Pharmaceutical demand of GAL has dramatically increased due to its significant effect on memory enhancement and AD control. The cost of GAL production is determined based on the quality of plant raw materials and their alkaloid content. The phytochemical characteristics of the plant materials were also affected by the extraction efficiency, which finally led to increase the costs of GAL production. Bulbs of Narcissus species and the other members of the Amaryllidaceae family including Leucojum aestivum L., Ungernia victoris Vved. ex Artjush., and Lycorice radiata Herb. have been reported as GAL-rich natural sources (Abou\u2010Donia et al. 2008; Berkov et al. 2009).",

In the past decades, in vitro culture techniques have been used to produce massive amounts of many SMs in a short time, especially for types with valuable pharmaceutical effects (Malik et al. 2011). Biotechnology, through in vitro plant cell, tissue, and organ culture (PCTOC) enables the production of plant bioactive compounds under stable and controlled conditions in a shorter period. Mainly, PCTOC has been assessed in the study of plant developmental processes, physiological changes, production, and extraction of SMs. Therefore, these techniques can be simultaneously used for mass propagation, cloning, and the production of SMs from cultured organs or cells to provide the high demand for pharmaceutical industries (Bonfill et al. 2013; Malik et al. 2011; Sarmadi et al. 2019).",

To the best of our knowledge, the effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs), photoperiod and their interaction on the in vitro bulblet proliferation of the plant has not been studied yet. In the following of our recent work on the quantification of GAL in the Iranian populations of N. tazetta  (Rahimi Khonakdari et al. 2018), the present study aimed to gain insight into the effect of photoperiod and various types and concentration of PGRs on bulb multiplication and biomass production of the plant in culture condition in vitro. This information can be used in the semi-industrial production of the important anti-AD compound GAL and the other AAs through controlled N. tazetta bulblet culture.",

Although this problem cannot be observed in meristem culture, the use of an effective method for the disinfection of the other materials, especially underground explants including bulbs, corms, tubers, and rhizomes is very necessary. Similar to the other bulbiferous plants such as Lilium and Tulips, bulbs of Narcissus contain a wide range of endophytes which can be contaminated the plant in vitro cultures.",

Although the use of mercuric chloride (0.1%) has been reported for the explant sterilization of some bulbous plants as Zephyranthes grandiflora (Gangopadhyay et al. 2010), and Lilium polyphyllum D. Don ex Royle (Taha et al. 2018), but it has not been considered in the present study due to the toxicity and health risk of its using. Abdel-Rahman et al. (2017) observed the best disinfection results for the bulbs of N. tazetta \u201cChinensis\u201d through soaking the bulbs in 70% ethanol for 10 min followed by soaking bulbs in 2% HgCl2 for 10 min. The bulb disinfection of Leucojum with 70% ethanol (1 min) and domestos bleach (5% chlorine) 50% and 30% at intervals of 30 and 10 min has been reported (Stanilova et al. 2010). Treatments of the explants with hot water (40\u201350 \u00b0C for 1 to 4 h) followed by drying before sterilizing them with hypochlorite solutions have also been suggested (Teixeira da Silva et al. 2016). The use of hot water at 40 and 54 \u00b0C has been reported to eliminate the internal contamination of Lilium and Narcissus bulbous explants, respectively (Langens-Gerrits et al. 1998; Lagnes-Gerrits and De Klerk 1999).",

            "text": "In vitro organogenesis can be affected by several factors such as plant genotype, storage conditions, explant type, polar orientation of the explants, photoperiod, temperature, composition of culture medium, and PGRs ( Chen and Ziv 2005; Abdel-Rahman et al. 2017; Begum et al. 2019; Cheesman et al. 2010; Garc\u00eda-Fortea et al. 2020; Nasircilar et al. 2011; Sairam et al. 2003). Photoperiod and concentration of PGRs are probably the most important influencing factors on in vitro organogenesis in the bulbous plants. In vitro propagation of Amaryllidaceae members through scale explants comprising a piece of basal plate has also been reported (Ault 1995; Diop et al. 2006; Fennell et al. 2004; Rice et al. 2011). It has been claimed that adventitious shoots were successfully proliferated from tissue at the base of bulb scales in many bulbous species (Ozel et al. 2015; Rice et al. 2011). So, it is necessary to include the basal plate as part of the scale explant for further bulblet proliferation. Ozel et al. (2007) reported that the combination of BAP-NAA has a significant effect on the proliferation of Muscaria bulbs from two-scale explants, which is consistent with the results obtained in this study (Ozel et al. 2007). An efficient in vitro regeneration of N. tazetta \u201cChinensis\u201d through twin-scale explants with basal plate cultured on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg l\u20121IBA + 1 mg l\u20121 triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and activated charcoal has been reported (Abdel-Rahman et al. 2017). The highest proliferation bulbs of Muscari mirum Speta has also been reported from four-scale explants cultured on MS medium containing 4 mg l\u20121 BAP and 0.25 mg l\u20121 NAA (Nasircilar et al. 2011). Rice et al. (2011) reported the highest bulblet induction from twin-scale explants of Brunsvigia undulata F.M. Leight cultured on hormone-free medium. In some reports, both increasing and decreasing effects of TDZ concentration on bulblet induction of bulbous plants have been reported (Huetteman and Preece 1993; Thomas 2007), which has an increasing effect when used in combination with NAA. So, the synergistic effect of NAA in combination with cytokinins has been claimed in the bulblet formation of bulbous plants.",

They revealed that the twin-scale explants isolated from the bulbs after three months in storage at 30 \u00b0C and a six week cold treatment at 15 \u00b0C produced high numbers of uniform adventitious buds. In their results, the elongated buds regenerated from inflorescence stem discs had a wide range of length variation when compared to adventitious shoots regenerated from twin-scale explants. They have also been studied the effect of polar orientation on regeneration of the inflorescence stem of N. tazetta which may be due to the presence of growth substances, especially the ratio of cytokinin and auxin within the explants. It has been claimed that the interactions between growth substances and the polar orientation of the explants, and their effects on the regeneration can be a complex phenomenon (Chen and Ziv 2005).",

The growth and developmental process of plants in in vitro cultures are significantly affected by the quality of light (color and wavelength), intensity, and photoperiod. Light is also often a key factor in the accumulation of SMs (Yang et al. 2018). The effect of different photoperiods on the regeneration rate of Paulownia under in vitro culture conditions has been reported (Yang et al. 2013). They approved that different light conditions can be affected by the leaf and root induction of the plant. In the contrary, Houllou et al. (2015) showed that photoperiod did not effect on shoot and root development of Capraria biflora L. while affected on the plant callus induction. The effect of photoperiod (16/8 h light/dark) on the bulb production from two-scale explants of B. undulata in in vitro condition has been reported (Rice et al. 2011). Cheesman et al. (2010) showed that 24 h dark completely inhibited bulblet formation in Eucomis zambesiaca. They have been found that the best bulblet induction occurred in the 8 h light cycle. Conversely, the highest bulblet regeneration in Hyacinthus orientalis (Kim et al. 1981) and L. longiflorum (Kumar et al. 2006) has been reported in continuous darkness which is in the opposite of our obtained results. The difference in results observed for N. tazetta could be due to the plant genotype and the type of explant used. Further studies on light conditions (quality and intensity) on the plant need to be investigated to optimize the real effect of light.",

Santos et al. (2002) reported similar results in in vitro culture of N. bulbocodium L. using MS medium with two different hormonal compositions (BAP 4 mg l\u20121 + NAA 12 mg l\u20121 and BAP 2 mg l\u20121 + IBA 1 mg l\u20121) which resulted in leaf induction on explants. In the second hormonal composition, a few small bulblets appeared after 70 days. Growth of proliferated bulblet was carried out with two subcultures on the same culture medium with an increase of 9% sucrose and with or without NAA. They revealed that NAA has not a significant effect on the bulblet size, but led to a better formation of the root. In in vitro propagation of Narcissus, the effect of BAP and NAA on the leaf induction has also been reported by Hussey (1982).",

(1996) showed that GAL production was stimulated by prolonged photoperiod in the shoots culture of N. confuses which has been reached to 2.5 mg g\u20121 DW in the plant tissue culture Berkov et al. (2009) also claimed that light is an important factor in the biosynthesis of GAL in the shoots of L. aestivum cultured in vitro. They found that GAL production in the light conditions is nearly twice that of dark conditions, which is in agreement with obtained results in the present study. The concentration of GAL in different plant organs of L. aestivum has been reported between 0.02 and 0.60 mg g\u20121 DW. As the other monocotyledons, callus induction and cell suspension culture establishment in Narcissus is relatively difficult. So, optimization of mass bulb proliferation of the plant can be considered as an efficient and alternative method for the production of medicinally important compound GAL. So far, several attempts for the production of GAL through in vitro cultures of the Amaryllidaceae family have been done. The effect of elicitation on the production of GAL in the shoot culture of N. confuses has been reported (Colque et al. 2004). Quantification of GAL in bulbs and in vitro cultures of N. papyraceus and four varieties of N. tazetta grown in Iran using GC-MS analysis has been recently reported (Tarakemeh et al. 2019). It has been shown that the content of GAL ranged from 6 to 105 \u00b5g g\u20121 DW among the studied species and varieties. They also showed that GAL accumulation was significantly stimulated by 4\u2032-O-methylnorbelladine precursor in in vitro culture samples of N. tazetta which has been reached to 1.7 and 82 \u00b5g g\u20121 DW in the calli and bulblet cultures, respectively. Production of GAL through in vitro tissue culture of N. pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton has been currently reported by Ferdausi et al. (2020). According to the obtained LC-MS results comparing with the previous report (Karakoyun and Unver-Somer 2019), lycorine, an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid, was also found in the proliferated N. tazetta bulblets. Interestingly, lycorine is a well-known natural alkaloid with a wide range of pharmaceutical properties (Roy et al. 2018). Antiviral activity of lycorine against severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), measles virus, coxsackie virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and herpes simplex virus type 1 has been reported (Szl\u00e1vik et al. 2004; Li et al. 2005). Therefore, further studies including optimization of medium culture conditions, elicitation, precursor feeding, and the other enhancement strategies can be recommended to produce this valuable alkaloid through developed in vitro mass bulblets culture of N. tazetta.",

The biomass production rate in these plants is very slow and time-consuming, so in vitro culture establishment of the plants like N. tazetta can be a good way to achieve maximum production of this medicinally important compound for further pharmaceutical purposes and commercial exploitation. Since GAL accumulation in the bulbs of Narcissus is higher than in the shoots, therefore, the present study focused on in vitro mass bulb production of the plant. This study showed that two-scale bulb explants of N. tazetta cultured on the MS medium supplemented with 2 mg l\u20121 of both BAP and NAA under photoperiod condition produced the highest number of bulblet. Media culture containing GA3 decreased bulblet proliferation in N. tazetta. It is worthy to note that more bulblets obtained from the medium supplemented with lower hormonal concentrations, which can be considered to reduce production costs in the mass bulblet culture of N. tazetta in the bioreactor for the commercial production of anti-AD compound GAL and medicinally important antiviral component lycorine as well.",
