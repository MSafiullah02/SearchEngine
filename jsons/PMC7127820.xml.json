Coronaviruses have large RNA genomes that probably exist as a heterogeneous RNA quasi-species due to an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a high rate of recombination (Lai and Holmes, 2001). Despite this genetic diversity, many coronaviruses cause disease in a single host species or several closely related host species (Siddell and Snijder, 1998). With the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that can cause lower respiratory tract disease in humans Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, a better understanding of how coronaviruses jump to a new host species is clearly needed.",

The specificity of MHV strains for susceptible mice and murine cell lines is determined by the binding of S to the amino (N)-terminal Ig-like domain of the murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) Beauchemin et al., 1999, Dveksler et al., 1993, Yokomori and Lai, 1992. Binding of the N-terminal domain of mCEACAM1a to S1 on MHV virions at 37 \u00b0C induces an irreversible conformational change in S2 that neutralizes virus and exposes a hydrophobic domain that presumably initiates fusion with host cell membranes Gallagher, 1997, Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002, Miura et al., 2004, Zelus et al., 2003. Mutational analysis and the crystal structure of mCEACAM1a[1,4] suggest that residues in the CC\u2032 loop and the C\u2032 \u03b2 sheet in the N-terminal domain of mCEACAM1a comprise the docking site for MHV Rao et al., 1997, Tan et al., 2002, Wessner et al., 1998.",

The N-terminal region of S is associated with the extended host range of MHV/BHK, a virus variant generated during persistent MHV-A59 infection of murine 17 Cl 1 cells (Sawicki et al., 1995). All of the recombinant viruses between the parental MHV-A59 and MHV/BHK that could grow in hamster cells retained 21 aa substitutions and a 7-aa insert in this region of S, as well as genes upstream of the S gene of MHV/BHK (Schickli et al., 2004). The 7-aa insert could have been generated either by a replicase stuttering mechanism or by recombination between the S gene of MHV-A59 and an mRNA encoding a cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit.",

Twenty-four point mutations and a 21-bp insert in the S gene result in 21 aa substitutions (Table 1)\nin the N\u2013terminus and a 7-aa insert (TRTKKVP) at aa 494 in the S glycoprotein of MHV/BHK. To determine whether the 21 aa substitutions, the 7-aa insert, or both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in S are sufficient to expand the host range of MHV-A59, we used targeted RNA recombination (TRR) to introduce the mutations found in the S gene of MHV/BHK into the genome of MHV-A59. Donor RNAs, transcribed in vitro from mutant pMH54 constructs, were transfected into feline (Fcwf) cells that had been inoculated with the chimeric helper virus fMHV (Kuo et al., 2000). The infected and transfected Fcwf cells were immediately overlaid onto monolayers of murine (17 Cl 1) cells to select for isogenic recombinant viruses that had gained the ability to infect murine cells due to a crossover event upstream of the S gene (Navas and Weiss, 2003). For each mutant pMH54 construct: SA59+i, S21BHK, S21BHK+i, and S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) (Fig. 1)\n, three recombinant viruses (A, B, and C) were independently recovered and plaque-purified to control for adventitious mutations that might arise in the S gene or in the rest of the viral genome. In addition, in every experiment, wild-type pMH54 RNA was used to reconstitute wild-type MHV-A59 virus (SA59) in triplicate.",

The S21BHK+i A and S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) C viruses also infected 17 Cl 1 cells in the presence of polyclonal anti-mCEACAM1a 649 serum (Fig. 7B), supporting the idea that these mutant viruses interact with an alternative receptor on murine cells and not with alternative epitopes on mCEACAM1a. The yield of S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) C was always lower than that of S21BHK+i A in the blockade experiments (Figs. 7A and B), suggesting that R496 in the insert may facilitate the interaction of the mutant viruses with an alternative receptor on murine cells.",

Although Syrian hamster (BHK) cells are not susceptible to MHV-A59 infection, BHK cells stably transfected with mCEACAM1a[1\u20134] (called BHK+mCEACAM1a) are productively infected by MHV-A59 (Dveksler et al., 1991). MHV-A59, MHV/BHK, and the 14 recombinant viruses were inoculated at an MOI of 10, as determined by plaque assay on murine 17 Cl 1 cells. Although MHV-A59, MHV/BHK, and the recombinant viruses infected BHK+mCEACAM1a cells, only MHV/BHK and the S21BHK+i viruses infected BHK cells (Fig. 8)\n. The S21BHK+i viruses induced syncytia in BHK cells, but MHV/BHK did not. The S of the S21BHK+i viruses was cleaved into 90-kDa S1 and S2 proteins like wild-type MHV-A59, although the S of MHV/BHK was uncleaved (data not shown). S21BHK+i A also infected Chinese hamster (CHO), feline (Fcwf), and monkey (Vero 76) cells, although the SA59 A, SA59+i A, S21BHK C, and S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) C viruses did not infect any of the non-murine cells tested. Thus, both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in the N-terminus of S are sufficient to extend the host range of MHV-A59.",

We examined the plaque-forming ability of all 14 of the recombinant viruses on Syrian (BHK) and Chinese (CHO) hamster cells. Both the S21BHK+i and S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) viruses formed plaques on BHK and CHO cell monolayers, although the SA59, SA59+i, and S21BHK viruses did not form plaques on either BHK or CHO cell monolayers (data not shown).

When inoculated at an MOI of 0.1, as determined by plaque assay on BHK cells, BHK cells yielded 3.5 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml of S21BHK+i A virions into the tissue culture supernatant at 16 h p.i (Fig 9A)\n. Unlike MHV/BHK, the yield of S21BHK+i A decreased after 16 h p.i., suggesting that the S21BHK+i viruses did not undergo a second round of replication in BHK cells under liquid medium. However, BHK+mCEACAM1a cells yielded 2.8 \u00d7 106 PFU/ml of S21BHK+i A virions at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 9A). When inoculated at an MOI of 0.1, as determined by plaque assay on BHK cells, the percentage of BHK cells infected by S21BHK+i A decreased from 0.1% at 24 h p.i. to undetectable levels at 72 h p.i.

However, the role of aa substitutions in S in the host range of MHV had not been previously studied using isogenic recombinant viruses that differ only in S. This study demonstrated that both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert found in N-terminal region of S of MHV/BHK are sufficient to permit the interaction of MHV-A59 with alternative receptors on murine and non-murine cells. Interestingly, although 12 of the 21 aa substitutions lie within of the N-terminal 330 aa of S that comprise the minimal receptor binding domain (RBD) for mCEACAM1a in vitro, 9 of the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert lie outside of the RBD Kubo et al., 1994, Tsai et al., 2003. Viruses with both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert (S21BHK+i) infected murine cells in the presence of blocking anti-mCEACAM1a MAb-CC1 or polyclonal 649 serum that inhibit MHV-A59 infection of murine cells (Fig. 7). The S21BHK+i viruses also infected Syrian and Chinese hamster, feline, and monkey cell lines that are normally resistant to MHV-A59 infection. The alternative receptor(s) used by the S21BHK+i viruses and MHV/BHK have not yet been identified. However, the extended host range variant MHV-H2 generated during persistent MHV infection of co-cultures of murine and hamster cells can utilize human carcinoembryonic antigen (hCEA) as a receptor Baric et al., 1997, Hensley and Baric, 1998.",

In addition, although the relative infectivities of the S21BHK+i and S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) viruses on hamster cell monolayers under agar were similar, the S21BHK+i(R\u2192L) viruses did not infect hamster cells under liquid medium (Table 3 and Fig. 8).

However, S21BHK+i virions bound mCEACAM1a in a virus overlay protein blot assay (data not shown) and were neutralized by soluble mCEACAM1a[1,4] at 37 \u00b0C like MHV-A59 (Fig. 5). In addition, recombinant S proteins with both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert bound to soluble mCEACAM1a[1,4] using an epitope that is blocked by MAb-CC1 just like wild-type S proteins (Fig. 6). Although both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in S permit MHV-A59 to productively infect non-murine cells, additional aa substitutions in S or mutations in other viral genes may be needed for efficient infection of non-murine cells. The S21BHK+i viruses entered and productively infected hamster BHK cells, but, unlike MHV/BHK, the S21BHK+i viruses did not induce a second round of infection in BHK cells under liquid medium (Fig. 9B).",

MHV infection of murine cells is associated with the rapid reduction of mCEACAM1a expression levels Chen and Baric, 1996, Rao and Gallagher, 1998, Sawicki et al., 1995. Mutations that enhance the affinity or avidity of S for mCEACAM1a or delay the triggering of S may be selected during persistent infection. These mutations in the S gene may also permit the interaction of MHV with alternative receptors on murine and non-murine cells. Although these variants may initially have inefficient interactions with alternative receptors, continued selection in persistently infected murine or non-murine cells may select for additional mutations in the S gene that optimize the interaction of MHV with alternative receptors. During continued passage in non-murine cells, extended host range variants of MHV may lose the ability to interact with mCEACAM1a and infect murine cells (Hensley et al., 1998).",

Although the mechanisms underlying the 2002 emergence of SARS-CoV in humans have not yet been identified, the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003 proved that mutation or recombination between previously known coronaviruses was not responsible for the emergence of this virus in humans. Instead, the emergence of SARS-CoV may reflect increased contact between animal reservoirs and human hosts at exotic food markets in China, genetic changes in or recombination between ancestral or previously unknown coronaviruses, or a combination of environmental and genetic changes Cyranoski and Abbott, 2003, Holmes, 2003, Rest and Mindell, 2003, Stanhope et al., 2004, Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004. The work described in this study suggests that relatively few aa substitutions in S may be sufficient to permit the introduction of a coronavirus into a new host species. Viruses closely related to human SARS-CoV isolates have been isolated from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog (Guan et al., 2003). One or more of the 10 aa substitutions in S that differ between the known animal and human SARS-CoV isolates may have extended the host range of the animal virus. Further studies are needed to examine the role of genetic change in the host range of SARS-CoV to evaluate the possibility of a reintroduction of SARS-CoV in humans from zoonotic reservoirs.",

Mutant templates were amplified with cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (PFU; Stratagene) using various primer pairs as specified by the manufacturer. Mutant templates were screened by restriction enzyme digestion or sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis using primers S(AvrII)+ and S(AvrII)\u2212 (Table 4)\nwas used to introduce a silent AvrII site at nt 37 and 38 of the S/pBS SK+ (Stratagene) construct. The AvrII mutation was subcloned into pBC SK+ (Stratagene) from S/pBS SK+ using BamHI sites to generate S/pBC SK+. Two fragments incorporating the 21-bp insert of MHV/BHK (ACTCGGACTAAGAAGGTACCA) were amplified using primers A59.3 and A59.24 or A59.23 and A59.20 (Table 4 and Schickli et al., 2004). PCR amplifications were run for five cycles of 1 min at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min at 60 \u00b0C, and 2 min at 72 \u00b0C using Pfu (Stratagene). The PCR products were mixed and amplified using primers A59.3 and A59.20 for 30 cycles as described above. The amplicon was subcloned into S/pBC SK+ using an AflII site at nt 332 and a BstEII site at nt 1508 to generate SA59+i. The 5\u2032 region of the S gene of MHV/BHK was amplified using primers S(AvrII)+ and A59.6 (Table 4 and Schickli et al., 2004). The amplicon was subcloned into S/pBC SK+ using AvrII and BstEII to generate S21BHK+i. Sequence analysis of S21BHK+i clones identified a clone with one coding mutation (G1487T) in the S gene generating S21BHK+i(R\u2192L). Site-directed mutagenesis using primers Span insert+ and Span insert\u2212 (Table 4) was used to eliminate the 21-bp insert from S21BHK+i, and the construct was subcloned into S/pBC SK+ using AvrII and BstEII to generate S21BHK. Following assembly in S/pBC SK+, all four S constructs were subcloned into pMH54 using AvrII and a XhoI site at nt 2486. The 5\u2032 end of each construct was sequenced by the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core Facility using ABI Prism kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (Wentworth and Holmes, 2001). Eight primers: S(IGS), A59.3, A59.4, A59.6, A59.7, A59.8, A59.13, and A59.14 (Table 4 and Schickli et al., 2004) were used to generate overlapping sequence for each construct.",
