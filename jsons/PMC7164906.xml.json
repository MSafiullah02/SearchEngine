Moreover, some patients with DLBCL also benefit from receiving central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis as intravenous high-dose methotrexate (MTX), which is considered superior to intrathecal MTX.10 Unfortunately, there is also a higher resource utilization with intravenous MTX, including hospitalization or multiple blood collection for MTX levels.",

Granulocyte stimulating agents (G-CSF) may be considered to mitigate neutropenia and reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (independent of blood counts or age).2.Subcutaneous rituximab should be considered to minimize patient time in health care facilities.3.The R-DA-EPOCH should be the treatment of choice for some aggressive lymphomas, such as the primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and double/triple-hit lymphomas. However, in the case of unavailability of medical beds or portable infusion pumps for outpatient treatment, the R-CHOP followed either by the ASCT (double/triple hit) or radiotherapy (PMBL) could be considered.4.The indication for CNS prophylaxis with intravenous MTX should consider the risk/benefit of exposing patients to risk in order to avoid an uncommon complication. Consider delaying the MTX to the end of the R-CHOP therapy. The CNS-IPI15 can help in determining high-risk patients and mandatory prophylaxis during this period.5.Do not delay the treatment for other aggressive lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma, etc.6.Outpatient salvage regimens should be preferred and if possible, ASCT should not be delayed.7.Postpone medical appointments for patients in complete remission or for patients in which no immediate change in therapy is expected. Virtual consultation/counseling is encouraged.\n",

A higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed with BV-AVD and G-CSF support was necessary.55 Balancing the risks and benefits of a more intensive regimen during times of medical resource exhaustion is difficult. However, since there is no clear consensus on the role of more intensive regimens that consume more resources, ABVD seems a good choice as initial treatment. Radiotherapy for early stage disease is usually applied, but can be omitted if not available with a 5\u20138% impact on PFS.56 A PET (Positron Emission Tomography \u2013 Computed Tomography) guided therapy may help identify patients in whom radiotherapy can be omitted.57\n",
