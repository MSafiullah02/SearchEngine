Animals and plants sustain human life and are essential for food security for the growing human population. An ever-increasing and unstoppable number of human infectious diseases arise from animals; 60 per cent of all human infectious disease are transmitted from animals1 and 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases originate from animals1. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that every year, around 2.6 billion people suffer from zoonotic illnesses and around 2.7 million succumb to these2. Several pandemics in current millennium including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza H5N1, influenza H1N1 and influenza H7N9 have animals as their sources. Around 1.67 million viruses are estimated to be enzootic with up to 50 per cent of these having the potential to invade humans under conducive environment including deforestation and damage to local ecosystem3. One of the major drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) perceived as the biggest challenge in global efforts to control communicable diseases, is the humongous irrational use of antimicrobial agents in the animal health sector4. Responding effectively to these challenges warrants a comprehensive, multisectoral, multi-institutional and multidisciplinary approach.",

Efforts have been made to institutionalize and operationalize One Health in Rwanda by having a three-pronged approach. This nationally coordinated plan comprised interdisciplinary collaboration at the government level, strengthening surveillance system for early detection of zoonoses and augmenting capacity for all aspects including research at the human-animal-ecosystem interface10.

One Health is a simple and powerful concept with a complex implementation process. It is imperative to bring about a change in the narrative in national response to zoonoses, improving food security and ensuring environmental integrity. The change has to be catalyzed by the top political leadership. Strong continuous advocacy, especially by international development partners, namely FAO, OIE and WHO, sharing of evidence-based outcomes, expected economic gains and global best practices should be shared with the top national leadership. The Sustainable Development Goals being intertwined offer a unique opportunity for advocacy as well as an integrated methodology12.
