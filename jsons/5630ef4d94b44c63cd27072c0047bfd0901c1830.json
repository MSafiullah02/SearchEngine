But most of the AECOPDs are correlated with bacterial and viral infections. Virus accounts for 40% of all the incidences. Of all the viral infections, the leading cause of COPD is rhinovirus (HRV) accounting for approximately 58%. Few pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus (HCoV), influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human adenovirus (HADV) are also included in the cause of COPD. 5, 6 Bacteria can be easily separated with specific remedial effects and, therefore, are easier to confirm, but viruses are hard to be isolated and detected to bring effective treatment outcomes. Therefore, importance of virus is not adequately recognized. Recently, with the development of clinical application of nucleic acid detection technology for respiratory viruses, the importance of viral infection in AECOPD has been increasingly regarded. 7 Clinicians expect to find some highly specific biomarkers that can easily and quickly confirm viral infection in AECOPD. Levels of C-reaction protein (CRP) increase rapidly during serious infections. But it is suggested that CRP and procalcitonin (PCT) may provide no valuable evidence in distinguishing bacterial and viral infections. 8 It is also reported that AECOPD is correlated with higher levels of airway proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) 9,10 and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) in viral infections. 11 Moreover, it is found that increased interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) is associated with HRV infection, and therefore, is considered as a biomarker in HRV infection. 12 In addition, there are no reports till date regarding other biomarkers in AECOPD that are associated with viral origin. 13, 14 Studies in the recent years showed that pathogens involved in the respiratory viral infections in Shanghai were mainly Flu and HRV. 15, 16 2282 patients (including adults and children) with acute respiratory tract infection were studied in Shanghai during 2009-2011, and then the results showed that the main pathogens were Flu and HRV. 15 Xia et al 16 had investigated 2346 adult patients with acute respiratory tract infection during 2012-2015 in Shanghai, which indicated that respiratory tract infections were mainly caused by FluA, followed by FluB.

In this study, FluA 1 FluB were observed to be a new and uncommon viral co-infection, which may in turn lead to the co-circulation in COPD crowd. We also found that the frequency of viral infection remained highest in the winter season and this was consistent with the study results by Zwaans et al 41 and Dimopoulos et al. 22 Seasonal distribution of influenza virus in patients with AECOPD was comparable to that in adults at the same time in Shanghai. 14 Clinical manifestations of AECOPD virus1 patients lacked specificity in this study, and this was consistent with the study results by Chang et al. 42 But Dimopoulos et al 22 found that the length of hospital stay in virus1 AECOPD patients was significantly higher than that in the virus2 AECOPD, and this indicated that it might be difficult to differentiate viral infections from nonviral infections based solely on clinical data. In addition, this study also found that older patients were significantly higher than nonelderly patients with viral infections, which was not in accordance with the study results of Dimopoulos et al. 5 It might be associated with regional differences, poor physical state, long COPD course, susceptibility of secondary bacterial infections, long recovery duration, and so on.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 410, "end": 412, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1054, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1518, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1536, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1975, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2000, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2131, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2281, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2305, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2765, "end": 2766, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "and Varkey et al 36 in"}, {"text": "Our study also found that respiratory viruses showed a significant increase in the serum IP-10 and IFN-g levels.
