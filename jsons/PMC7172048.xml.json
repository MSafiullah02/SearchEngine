            "text": "High throughput sequencing techniques found out the presence of two new polyomaviruses in respiratory secretions of children with acute respiratory symptoms [1,2]. These new viruses were called Karolinska Institut (KIPyV) and Washington University (WUPyV) polyomaviruses. KIPyV and WUPyV, as the BK and JC polyomaviruses, persist in a latent form in the human body but they could mainly reactivate in patients with immunosuppression. The initial identification of KIPyV and WUPyV in respiratory samples was progressively extended to other human fluids including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, lymphoid tissue, urine, stool and saliva [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. Serological evaluations demonstrated that the primary infections by KIPyV and WUPyV occur early in life through the respiratory and fecal routes. It is noteworthy that the seroprevalence of antibodies to VP1 protein is detected in adult population of about 80% for WUPyV and 70% for KIPyV [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. The genome detection of these two viruses in samples achieved from children is well documented whereas has been rarely revealed from immunocompetent adults. These viruses mainly infect young patients and their reactivation is related to immunosuppression cases including HIV positive patients and in stem cell transplanted patients [[11], [12], [13]]. The prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV genome detection varied from 2 to 9%, in patients with respiratory symptoms [14] however, the detection of KIPyV and WUPyV genomes in respiratory samples is often related to high rate of co-infection with other major respiratory diseases such as Respiratory syncitial virus, Parainfluenza viruses, Adenovirus, Rhinovirus and Influenza virus [11,[15], [16], [17]]. Moreover, KIPyV and WUPyV were found at approximately similar percentages in healthy patients. Hence, the real pathogenicity of these viruses in the respiratory disease is still unclear even though KIPyV and WUPyV were detected in clinical cases without any viral co-infection in symptomatic patients with respiratory disorders including pneumonia, bronchiolitis and bronchitis [17,18]. These recent observations suggest that KIPyV and WUPyV may be directly involved in the onset of respiratory diseases thus determining the need of reliable molecular procedures for the infection diagnosis of these two viruses. In this study, we developed a duplex PCR procedure for a single tube detection of these two viruses in clinical samples. This method was also assessed on 482 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from hospitalized pediatric patients previously analyzed for major respiratory viruses with a commercial multiplex PCR assay. The data obtained showed the analytical performances of the assay, the prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV infection and the viral co-infection in this specific pediatric population.",

This analysis was carried out comparing the selected sequences with the polyomavirus sequences in NCBI sequence database using the NCBI BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).

TaqMan-based real-time quantitative PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcL consisting of 25 \u03bcL of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), 0.5 \u03bcM of each KIPyV and WUPyV specific primer, 0.25 \u03bcM of KIPyV and WUPyV specific probes, 10 \u03bcL of DNA extracted either from clinical samples or scalar dilutions of synthetic double strand oligonucleotide positive control (from 5 \u00d7 106 to 5 \u00d7 101 copies/mL) and 12.5 \u03bcL of double-distilled water. The amplification was carried out in a BioRad CFX96 real-time PCR system (BioRad Laboratories). The analysis of results was determined by real-time CFX Manager Software version 3.1 (BioRad Laboratories). All standard dilutions, controls and samples from patients were run in duplicate and the average value of the copy number was employed to quantify KIPyV or WUPyV genome contents.

To rule out possible cross-reactivity with human, microbial or unrelated viral sequences, we performed a homology analysis in NCBI database. No significant homologies were detected indicating that these oligonucleotides designed on VP1 region sequence of both viruses can be considered specific for KIPyV and WUPyV amplifications. The sensitivity of the duplex real-time PCR assay was determined by testing serial dilutions (from 5 \u00d7 107 to 5 \u00d7 101 copies/mL) of two different synthetic dsDNAs carrying specific sequences of VP1 region either of KIPyV (89 nt) or WUPyV (90 nt). The choice of specific fluorochrome conjugated to KIPyV or WUPyV TaqMan probes allows the detection of KIPyV and WUPyV in 510 nm or 555 nm channels, respectively. The analysis of 10 replicates of synthetic dsDNAs displayed positive detection in 100% samples with 5 \u00d7 102 copies/mL (approximately 17 copies/reaction) for either KIPyV or WUPyV (Table 2\n). In the next series of replicates, (5 \u00d7 102, 4 \u00d7 102, 3 \u00d7 102, 2 \u00d7 102, 1 \u00d7 102, 5 \u00d7 101 copies/mL), linear regression analysis with Probit model analysis has been calculated: the limit of detection in at least the 95% of replicates were determined at 328 copies/mL (12 copies/reaction) with a 95% confidence interval from 256 to 444) for KIPyV and 345 copies/mL (15 copies/reaction) with a 95% confidence interval from 284 to 472) for WUPyV, respectively (Table 3\n). Our assay showed an efficiency >90% with a correlation coefficient R2 > 0.99 for both the viral targets. The linearity of this assay is detectable in 10-fold scalar dilutions (n = 5 for each dilution) from 5 \u00d7 106 copies/mL to 5 \u00d7 102 copies/mL. The specificity of the duplex real-time PCR assay was verified by examining negative controls and positive samples for different respiratory viruses including Flu A, Flu B, PIV, AdV, HRV, RSV A, RSV B, HBoV, HCoV, hMPV and HEVs (n = 3 for each virus). All these samples did not show any positive signal either for KIPyV or WUPyV determination.",

Similarly, we have compared the data obtained in three separate experiments performed in triplicate for the inter-assay evaluation. The results showed a coefficient of variation calculated on Ct average always less than 3% for all scalar dilutions either for KIPyV or WUPyV. It is well known that the presence of very different concentration of viral targets in duplex PCR can interfere on sensitivity reaction [21,22]. We assayed a combination of a high concentration (106 copies/mL) and a low concentration (103 copies/mL) of synthetic target of KIPyV and WUPyV in an interference test [23]. The results (Table 5\n) did not show systematic difference in the amplification curves of the mixed targets with respect to the run performed with a single target. The CV mean value showed a difference less than 2% suggesting a low interference when different template concentrations of targets were simultaneously amplified.",

This commercial multiplex PCR assay detects the major human respiratory viruses. The multiplex assay has determined the presence of viral pathogens in 339 out of 482 specimens (70.3%). The analysis of the 339 positive samples has shown that 30% of positive samples were co-infected with two or more viruses (Fig. 1\n). Based on frequency of detection (Fig. 1), RSV (A and B) was detected in 28.9% of positive samples, followed by HRV (23%), HBoV (16.2%), AdV (13.9%) and Flu A/B viruses (7.7%). Hence, we have assessed our duplex real-time PCR in the same samples and our data indicated that 15 out of 482 samples (3.1%) were positive for KIPyV whereas WUPyV was detected in 24 out of 482 samples (4.9%). The mean value of KIPyV viral load of positive samples was determined between 5.71 \u00d7 102 and 8.64 \u00d7 106 copies/mL with a median value of 1946 copies/mL whereas the WUPyV viral load in positive specimens was calculated between 4.09 \u00d7 102 and 1.22 \u00d7 107 copies/mL with a median value of 53444 copies/mL (Table 6\n). Since these two Polyomaviruses are often associated to other viral infection, we determined whether the KIPyV and/or WUPyV positive samples showed a viral co-infection analyzing the data obtained with commercial Allplex\u2122 respiratory panel assay kit. This analysis displayed that 11 out of 15 KIPyV positive samples showed one or more viral co-infections, whereas WUPyV was associated to other viruses in 21 out of 24 cases. Interestingly, in this patient group, KIPyV is preferentially associated with HRV (9 out of 15 samples) followed by RSV A/B and AdV (3 out of 15 samples). On other hand, WUPyV exhibited a major association with HRV (9 out of 24 samples) followed by RSV A/B viruses (7 out of 24 samples) and AdV (6 out of 24 samples). It is noteworthy that KIPyV and WUPyV were simultaneously detected in three samples. All these three KIPyV/WUPyV double positive cases showed that these two viruses were associated with at least another respiratory virus (Table 6).",

Our technique detects the 100% of KIPyV and WUPyV positive samples with 5 \u00d7 102 copies/mL. In addition, Probit analysis indicated that our assay is able to detect until 328 copies/mL for KIPyV and 345 copies/mL WUPyV in the 95% of replicates. The sensitivity of this assay is similar to previous real-time PCRs [[24], [25], [26]] and its analytical performances demonstrated that this approach might be considered a useful tool for KIPyV and WUPyV genome detections. The choice of a TaqMan format with a combined detection show clearer advantages than separate analysis as this format may be developed in multiplex assays with additional respiratory viruses. This aspect may be interesting because commercial and laboratory developed multiplex assays for respiratory viruses have not KIPyV and WUPyV among the targets.",

We found a prevalence of 3.1% and 4.9% for KIPyV and WUPyV positive samples, respectively during the screening of these 482 pediatric samples. These data are in according to other studies [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]] on KIPyV and WUPyV detection. In fact, the prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV varies from 0.5 to 5% for KIPyV and 0.4\u20139% for WUPyV in immunocompetent pediatric and adult patients, whereas in immunodeficiency patients, the prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV viruses significantly increased in respiratory samples. Our data also confirmed that the prevalence of WUPyV is higher than KIPyV as previously indicated [14]. The difference of prevalence described in past studies may be related either to regional prevalence variations or age population selection. In particular, a higher detection of KIPyV and WUPyV in respiratory samples of pediatric patients than in adult patients was noticed. It is noteworthy that several observations proved a correlation between age and KIPyV and/or WUPyV DNA detection: KIPyV showed a prevalence peak of genome detection at 1\u20132 years of age whereas WUPyV displayed the peak later, between 5 and 24 years of age [11,[33], [34], [35]].",

However, the association between KIPyV and/or WUPyV infections and respiratory diseases is controversial because these two viruses showed very high co-infection rates with other respiratory viruses increasing the complexity of KIPyV and/or WUPyV roles in the respiratory pathogenesis. In particular, previous studies have displayed KIPyV co-detection rate with other respiratory viruses around 74% whereas WUPyV showed variable rates between 68% and 97% [27,28,33,36,37]. In our paper, we also investigated these viral co-infections using the data previously generated on these samples with Allplex\u2122 respiratory panel assay kit that can show the presence of 16 respiratory viruses by multiplex approach. Multiple infections (Table 6) were detected in 11 out of 15 KIPyV infected specimens whereas WUPyV was detected with other respiratory viruses in 21 out of 24 cases. Interestingly, we have described, in our group of patients, the contemporary presence of KIPyV and WUPyV genomes in three cases. In all three cases, however, at least one additional respiratory was detected. The co-infection detection have suggested that KIPyV and WUPyV may be not directly involved in the disease induction and these viruses may be considered as either opportunistic agents, or viruses that other infections could reactivate in respiratory epithelia. In spite of these observations, we have detected seven cases where KIPyV or WUPyV were detected in apparent absence of concomitant respiratory viral infection. The detection of single infection in our patients with respiratory disease may suggest the direct role of these viruses as causative agents of respiratory disorders even though we cannot exclude the possibility that these patients may be infected with other pathogens (i.e. bacteria) not revealed with commercial multiplex analysis.",
