There are numerous challenges for the attainment of this goal, and diverse approaches ranging from insulin pumps to gene therapy to stem cell strategies are all being pursued. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In another approach, the replacement of lost islet cells through human islet allotransplantation has established the clinical utility of islet grafting. 6, 7 Although only 13% of human islet recipients remain insulin-independent at 5 years, the majority of patients (67%) retain some graft function as evidenced by persistent C-peptide secretion. 8 Importantly, islet transplantation largely eliminates hypoglycemic unawareness post-grafting. Further improvement in long-term insulin independence is likely; data from a few select Methods: A four-checkpoint program systematically screens the donor herd (Large White -Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace F1 hybrid animals), individual sentinel and pancreas donor animals and, critically, the islet macrobeads themselves. Molecular assays screen for more than 30 known viruses, while electron microscopy and in vitro studies are employed to screen for potential new or divergent (emergent) viruses. Organization institutions indicate that an increasing number of islet recipients (approaching 50%) are able to maintain external insulin independence for 5 years. 9 Nonetheless, the availability of suitable human pancreases for either whole organ or isolated islet transplantation is entirely inadequate as evidenced by the recovery of only 1293 donor pancreases in the United States in 2015. 10 The use of xenogeneic islets could provide a solution to the limited supply of human islets for transplantation. Porcine islets are particularly suitable as a source of insulin-producing cells because porcine insulin differs from human insulin by only a single amino acid and porcine insulin has been shown to provide reliable and safe glycemic control in human diabetic patients. Furthermore, only the transplantation of whole pancreas or intact islets of Langerhans can be expected to replicate normal and precise physiological glucose control, which is dependent on a variety of cell types and proteins from pancreatic islets.

Essential to our approach is the establishment of four checkpoints that span the macrobead production and transplantation processes. The checkpoint approach is built upon an increasing level of microbiological screening from the donor herd up to the islet product, using multiple assay formats with the ability to screen for known and unknown pathogens. Using the checkpoint approach, we provide evidence to support the use of donor animals housed in high hygienic but not HEPA-filtered environments, not only for islet xenotransplantation but also other xeno-cell therapies.

It is worth mentioning that the NHP is not an ideal model to assess the risk of PERV transmission. Cynomolgus monkeys lack the PERV-A receptor 1 (PAR-1) that is the major receptor for PERV-A and PERV-A/C entry. 66 The actual risk of PERV infection in the clinic remains unclear, but so far there has been no transmission of PERV or other porcine microorganisms in humans that have been exposed to pig islet cells. 63, [67] [68] [69] We consider these findings, as well as the negative viral findings from diabetic dogs exposed to porcine islet macrobeads for 2.4 years, to be evidence that viral transmission following macrobead implantation is very low risk. 15 Studies with D17 canine cells have shown these cells to have the PERV-A receptor, 70 but apparently not to the same degree as human 293 cells. 71 Other, non-microbiological risks to the patient also exist and must be considered as part of the comprehensive safety evaluation. These include procedural risks that accompany pre-and post-implantation screening, as well as the general anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery required to implant the macrobeads. The procedural risks are well known and, although real, are modest. We have been implanting cancer macrobeads (encapsulated mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells) to treat patients with various malignancies for 10 years without adverse events attributable to the macrobeads either as an intraperitoneal irritant or as a microbiological hazard. 78 See also ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT00283075, NCT01053013, and NCT02046174.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 377, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 578, "end": 581, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 824, "end": 826, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 909, "end": 911, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 970, "end": 972, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1622, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A final important consideration is the immune status of the recipients. Recent progress in clinical islet allotransplantation has confirmed the potential of islet grafting to reduce exogenous insulin administration and the occurrence of hypoglycemic unawareness. 6, 7 While these results are encouraging, numerous adverse events including intrahepatic bleeding, neutropenia, mouth ulcers, anemia, diarrhea, edema, hypercholesterolemia, and pharyngitis have been reported. 79 Most of the reported adverse events are primarily associated with immunosuppressive therapy. Encapsulating porcine islets using the agaroseagarose method eliminates the need for immunosuppressive therapy, and a fully competent immune system is expected to significantly reduce the risk of xenozoonotic infection. 80 During the last 20 years, an understanding of the risks associated with porcine xenotransplantation, and methodologies to manage those risks, including theoretical risks and the potential presence of unknown pathogens, have significantly progressed. The recent IXA consensus update notes that \"theoretical risk\" still exists in relation to the transmission of infectious agents when employing appropriate safeguards, but that such events will likely be rare should they occur. 44 Although the actual risks of islet xenotransplantation cannot be not known in the absence of clinical trials, as stated by Fishman, \"In clinical xenotransplantation, a level of safety has been developed beyond that available for human organs\u2026\". 84 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 265, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 266, "end": 267, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 472, "end": 474, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 788, "end": 790, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1270, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1518, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Insulin pump risks and benefits: a clinical appraisal of pump safety standards, adverse event reporting and research needs.

Given the lack of clinical signs, positive antibody titers for Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Porcine parvovirus, and Influenza A confirm the efficacy of the herd vaccination program. Porcine respiratory coronavirus was found to be present in the herd, as expected for domestic swine. Tissue homogenate samples from six sentinel and 11 donor animals, over the same 2-year period, were negative for the presence of viruses when co-cultured with six different cell lines from four species. The absence of adventitious viruses in separate islet macrobead preparations produced from 12 individual pancreas donor animals was confirmed using validated molecular (n = 32 viruses), in vitro culture (cells from four species), and transmission electron microscopy assays (200 cell profiles per donor animal) over the same 2-year period. There has been no evidence of viral transmission following the implantation of these same encapsulated and functional porcine islets into non-immunosuppressed diabetic cynomolgus macaques for up to 4 years. Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all time points were negative for PCV (Type 2), PLHV, PRRSV, PCMV, and PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C by PCR analysis in all six recipient animals. Conclusion: The four-checkpoint program is a robust and reliable method for characterization of the microbiological safety of encapsulated porcine islets intended for clinical trials.

The qualification report contains detailed information on all diagnostic assays used to screen source animals and includes assay protocols and data regarding sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability. The MVDL assays are validated according to guidelines established by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, and Standard Operating Procedures are available from the MVDL upon request (vdl@umn.edu). Detection of the different target agents included the following methods: Bacterial Culture, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), conventional or quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR or qPCR, respectively) and quantitative Reverse Transcription (qRT-PCR), Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI), Serum Neutralization (SN), Virus Isolation (VI), and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT).

The ability of this program to ensure that the health status of donor animals is high and that islet macrobeads are consistently negative for bacterial or viral contamination is now firmly established. The safety program is open to continual review and refinement in consultation with relevant experts throughout the world. For example, the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide an additional screen of islet macrobeads for known and unknown viruses and for other extraneous agents has been recently implemented as it is routinely applied in vaccine production, even though TEM has a considerably lower sensitivity compared to PCR.
