Binding of IFN to the IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 receptor (Ifnar) on infected and uninfected cells results in a signaling cascade that restricts the infection of many viruses through expression of ISGs.

Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex are differentially permissive for WNV infection in humans8,12. To determine whether these neurons respond uniquely to antiviral cytokines and infectious challenge, we infected granule cell neurons and cortical neuron cultures with WNV in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (Fig. 1). IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (100 IU ml\u22121, 24 h) inhibited WNV replication in cortical neurons by 15-fold (P < 0.0001) and reduced infection \u223c100-fold (P < 0.0001) in granule cell neurons at 24\u201348 h after infection (Fig. 1a). We also found a greater responsiveness to IFN-\u03b2 in granule cell neurons compared to cortical neurons when cells were infected with other positive-stranded RNA viruses, including another flavivirus (Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), up to 95-fold), an alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), up to 10,000-fold, P < 0.0001) and a coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), up to 200-fold, P < 0.0005) (Fig. 1b\u2013d). Granule cell neurons were also less permissive for WNV replication at baseline in the absence of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (15- to 110-fold lower virus titers at 24 and 48 h, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1a), and we found similar results with SLEV (up to 700-fold, P < 0.005), VEEV (up to 200-fold, P < 0.05) and MHV (up to 20-fold at 24 and 36 h, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1b\u2013d). The percentage of cells infected by WNV was greater in cultures of cortical neurons compared to granule cell neurons at baseline or after IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with the observation of greater infection of cortical neurons, the concentration of type I IFN secreted into the supernatant after WNV infection was higher in cortical neurons compared to granule cell neurons cultures (Supplementary Fig. 2).",

Global gene expression in granule cell neurons and cortical neurons in response to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment revealed overlapping yet distinct gene signatures (Fig. 2a). Computational analysis revealed that genes associated with type I IFN induction (PRR, such as TLR and RLR), IFN regulatory factors (for example, Irf1, Irf7 and Irf9) and effector function (for example, Mx1 and Oas) were induced in both granule cell neurons and cortical neurons (Supplementary Table 1). We speculated that the two neuronal subtypes might differentially express key host defense genes at the basal level, which could affect responsiveness to IFN and susceptibility to infection. Indeed, the basal expression and IFN-\u03b2\u2013induced expression of genes involved in IFN induction, signaling and effector function were generally higher in granule cell neurons (Fig. 2b; P < 0.01) and included Irf7, Stat1, Ifit1 and Oas1 (Supplementary Table 2). This pattern, which we confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3), suggests that the greater IFN sensitivity of granule cell neurons may be caused by higher basal expression of PRR and IFN signaling genes. Indeed, some of the ISGs (for example, Stat1, Ifi27 and Rsad2) showed differential basal expression yet similarly induced levels of expression after IFN-\u03b2 treatment. Other ISGs (for example, Ccl5 and Cxcl5) showed differences in expression patterns between IFN-\u03b2\u2013treated and WNV-infected cells. This may reflect variation in IFN-dependent and -independent gene induction that occurs in the context of WNV replication and recognition by intracellular PRR.",

In particular, Stat1 and IFN signaling\u2013dependent genes (for example, Ifit1, Ifit3, Oas and Mx1) were basally expressed in granule cell neurons at higher levels compared to their expression in cortical neurons. In resting or IFN-\u03b2\u2013pretreated granule cell neurons, we found an enrichment of genes that have been linked to antiviral activity (for example, Ifit1, Rsad2, Oas1, Irf7, Bst2 (also called Tetherin), Unc93b1, Ifih1, Ddx58, Mx1, Ikbke (also called Ikk\u025b) and Stat1), autophagy and inflammation (immune-related GTPases (IRGs), such as Irgm1, Irgm2, Igtp (also called Irgm3), Ifi47 (also called Irg47) and Tgtp1 (also called Irgb6) and leukocyte chemotaxis (Ccl5, Cxcl1, Cxcl10 and Cxcl16) (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2).

Thus, higher basal expression of host defense genes makes granule cell neurons poised for faster antiviral action in response to IFN-\u03b2 than cortical neurons and ultimately affects the induced expression of ISGs. Notably, the addition of a blocking monoclonal antibody to Ifnar enhanced (\u223c20-fold, P < 0.0001) WNV replication in granule cell neurons yet had little effect in cortical neurons (Fig. 1f). Therefore, the lower susceptibility of granule cell neurons to viral replication compared to cortical neurons at baseline can probably not be attributed to differences in virus entry but rather to higher expression of genes with an IFN signature, which confer greater responsiveness to the antiviral effects of type I IFN.",

We hypothesized that IFN-\u03b2 would have a greater antiviral effect on WNV-MAD compared to WNV-NY in cortical neurons. Indeed, WNV-MAD infection was restricted to a greater degree (\u223c300-fold at 24 h after infection, P < 0.0001) after IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment of cortical neurons (Fig. 1e). In comparison, the inhibitory effects of IFN-\u03b2 against both WNV-MAD and WNV-NY were more similar (\u223c80-fold for WNV-MAD compared to \u223c50-fold for WNV-NY at 24 h after infection, P < 0.0001) in granule cell neurons. These results support the idea that Stat1-dependent signaling proteins are expressed at greater levels basally in granule cell neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5) and contribute to the enhanced responsiveness to the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 in this cell type. To establish whether the differential expression of ISGs was caused by Stat1-dependent signaling, we repeated the studies in Stat1\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type granule cell neurons. Stat1\u2212/ \u2212 granule cell neurons showed lower basal expression of several ISGs compared to wild-type granule cell neurons (Supplementary Fig. 6).",

We attempted to create a granule cell neuron\u2013like antiviral phenotype by ectopically expressing individual granule cell neuron\u2013specific genes in cortical neurons. Candidate genes included those showing higher expression at the basal level (for example, Irg1, Ifi27, Ifi44, Isg15, Bst2, Rsad2, Ifitm3, Ifi204, Trim30 and Casp12) or greater induction after IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (for example, Ifit2, Cmpk2 and Lcn2) in granule cell neurons (Supplementary Table 2). We included Irf1, which was reported as a broad-acting antiviral signaling molecule15,16, as a positive control. We developed a high-efficiency (\u223c90%) lentivirus transduction system for ectopic expression of ISGs in primary neurons (Fig. 4a). We cloned 39 ISGs, transduced them into cortical neurons and assessed their antiviral effects in the absence or presence of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Three genes (Irg1, Ifi27 and Rsad2) resulted in reduced (5- to 20-fold, P < 0.05) WNV yield when expressed ectopically in cortical neurons (Fig. 4b,c); analogously, we also found reduced SLEV infection with expression of these genes (threefold to tenfold, P < 0.0001) and reduced WNV-MAD infection (5- to 20-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4f,g). Ectopic expression of Irg1 (sevenfold, P < 0.0005) and Ifi27 (threefold, P < 0.01) but not Rsad2 (P > 0.05) inhibited MHV infection (Fig. 4h). Ectopic expression of these three genes (or of any of the other ISGs tested) did not alter cell viability (Fig. 4d and data not shown) or confer an antiviral effect when tested in parallel against VEEV (Fig. 4e); thus, it is unlikely that the antiviral effect with WNV was caused by cellular stress. Moreover, transduction of shRNA against Ifi27, Irg1 or Rsad2 in granule cell neurons correspondingly resulted in enhanced infection by WNV-MAD (approximately tenfold, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4i).",

To investigate this, we pretreated cortical neurons with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), infected them with WNV and evaluated virus infection. Although treatment with the HDAC inhibitor did not alter cell viability under the conditions tested, it reduced viral yields (fivefold, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5a) and resulted in derepression of ISGs that otherwise had low basal expression levels in cortical neurons (Fig. 5b).",

Our inhibitor experiments suggested that differential histone acetylation contributes to the lower basal expression of Stat1 and key ISGs in cortical neurons. One candidate for regulating this phenotype is miRNA-132, which is required for the morphogenesis of cortical and hippocampal neurons, targets p300 and negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling and antiviral immunity24,25,26. Expression of miRNA-132 is reportedly higher in the cerebral cortex compared to the cerebellum of rats and humans27,28. We found higher expression of miRNA-132 in cortical neurons and the cerebral cortex compared to granule cell neurons and the cerebellum (Fig. 5c). Moreover, ectopic expression of miRNA-132 in granule cell neurons (Fig. 5d) decreased the expression of some ISGs (Fig. 5e) but did not change the expression of non-ISGs (Fig. 5f). However, there was no change in viral yield when miRNA-132 was expressed ectopically in granule cell neurons (data not shown). We suggest that the distinct antiviral programs observed between granule cell neurons and cortical neurons are explained in part by differences in the epigenetic state of key genes, which may be influenced by the expression of specific miRNAs.",

The low level of granule cell neurons infection, however, was not caused by inefficient viral spread to the cerebellum, as the adjacent Purkinje cell neurons were infected.

Neuronal injury associated with extensive infection of granule cell neurons might cause defects in motor movement, learning, posture and balance30. In addition to our identification of distinct host defense signatures of specific neuronal subtypes, cell-extrinsic effects of resident glial cells also could contribute to innate immune programming of neurons. A recent study demonstrated regional differences in basal chemokine and cytokine secretion by astrocytes grown from the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and spinal cord31, although no differences in type I IFN production were reported. Although it is possible that glial cells contribute to the neuron-specific infection pattern observed in vivo, our primary neuron cultures lacked astrocyte contamination, and thus cell-extrinsic regulation cannot explain the differential infectivity and innate gene expression patterns of granule cell neurons and cortical neurons observed in culture.",

Ifi27 was first suggested to have antiviral activity against Sindbis virus infection in mice32 and may also attenuate infection of hepatitis C virus33, although its mechanism of action remains unknown. Irg1 is induced in macrophages and tissues from mice infected with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii or the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes34. So far, no antimicrobial functions have been ascribed to this gene, although it associates with the mitochondria, a site of regulation for PRR adaptor molecules and the antiviral signalosome34,35. Ectopic expression of Rsad2 in cortical neurons also showed an antiviral effect against WNV infection, results that are consistent with recent studies in Rsad2\u2212/\u2212 mice36. Rsad2 is an endoplasmic reticulum\u2013associated protein that has reported antiviral activity against several viruses, possibly because it inhibits bulk protein secretion, lipid raft formation and virus budding, and localizes to endoplasmic reticulum\u2013derived lipid droplets37.",

We observed a large number of Stat1-dependent genes that were expressed at higher levels in the basal and induced states in granule cell neurons compared to cortical neurons. Unphosphorylated Stat1 can promote the expression of antiviral genes without IFN-dependent stimulation43, and higher basal levels of Stat1 can amplify cell-intrinsic immune responses by activating an amplification loop44,45. Stat1 and its downstream gene targets could be differentially regulated in granule cell neurons and cortical neurons by epigenetic control mechanisms, miRNA-dependent control mechanisms or both. The epigenetic control of ISG expression and its impact on antiviral responses has been reported17,18,19,20. Accordingly, treatment of cortical neurons with an HDAC inhibitor reduced WNV yield and resulted in derepression of the expression of ISG at the basal level. One caveat to these studies is that inconsistent ISG expression phenotypes have been observed with HDAC inhibitors46,47, although these differences may reflect variation in cell types or concentration and time of inhibitor incubation. Our experiments also revealed higher expression in cortical neurons compared to granule cell neurons of miRNA-132, which targets the p300 coactivator of Stat1; ectopic expression of miRNA-132 in granule cell neurons decreased the basal expression of ISGs. Distinct antiviral programs observed between granule cell neurons and cortical neurons may be explained by differences in the epigenetic state of key genes, which is influenced by the expression of miRNA. It is intriguing to consider that the basal expression set point of ISGs in different neuronal subtypes may vary among individuals, which could influence the level of infection and spread once encephalitic viruses reach the CNS.",
