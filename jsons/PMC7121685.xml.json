The frontal prominence forms during the 4th postovulatory week and gives rise to the superior and middle portions of the face. The maxillary and nasal swellings form beneath the frontal prominence. At the end of the 4th week, two surface thickenings of the nasal swellings form the nasal placodes, which are of ectodermal origin and give rise to the epithelial lining of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The placodes invaginate, producing the nasal pits that become the anterior nares (nostrils) and, more deeply, the primitive posterior choanae. The medial nasal and frontal processes give rise to the nasal septum, frontal bones, nasal bones, ethmoid sinus complexes, and upper incisors. The lateral nasal and maxillary processes fuse to form the philtrum and columella. The cartilaginous nasal capsule forms deep to the nasal and frontal bones from the chondrocranium (skull base) during the 7th and 8th postovulatory weeks. The paranasal sinuses develop from the lateral nasal walls at the sixth fetal week, and their growth continues after birth, throughout childhood and adolescence. The maxillary sinus is the first to develop, starting approximately at the 70th day of gestation from the lateral wall of the nasal cavities. The frontal sinuses derive from the region of the frontal recess of the nose, and the ethmoid sinuses originate as multiple separate evaginations from the nasal cavities, while the sphenoid sinuses take origin as evaginations from the posterior nasal capsule reaching the sphenoid bone.",

The floor is formed by the hard palate, which comprises the palatine process of the maxillary bone and the horizontal plate of the palatine bone [2]. The lateral walls have three turbinates or conchae and three horizontal spaces, or meatii, on each side. The nasolacrimal duct opens in the inferior meatus, whereas the middle meatus receives drainage from the frontal, anterior ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Below the superior turbinate is the sphenoethmoid recess, with the openings of the sphenoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses. Each nasal cavity communicates posteriorly with the nasopharynx through the choanae and anteriorly with the nostril. The dilatation formed inside the aperture of each nostril is known as the vestibule. The columella separates medially both vestibules. The paranasal sinuses are a group of cavities within the corresponding craniofacial bones (maxilla, sphenoid, ethmoid, and frontal) which communicate with the nasal cavities through an ostium.",

Numerous goblet cells are interspersed in the respiratory-type epithelium. The lamina propria contains several seromucous glands, lymphocytes, monocytes, and a well-developed vascular network, particularly evident in the inferior and middle turbinate. The olfactory mucosa lines the horizontal part of the roof of the nasal cavity.

Swelling of the mucosa may cause obstruction of a sinus ostium, with subsequent secondary bacterial infection (acute bacterial sinusitis). The most commonly involved agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [5, 6]. Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is part of an inherited syndrome which also may manifest as atopic eczema and asthma. In allergic rhinitis, airborne particles, such as grass pollens, molds, and animal allergens, are deposited on the nasal mucosa giving rise to acute and chronic reactions. Allergens combine with the IgE antibodies produced by the plasma cells of the nasal mucosa which are avidly bound to the Fc-epsilon receptors on mast cells. This triggers degranulation of mast cells and releases the inflammatory mediators of the type I hypersensitivity reaction, causing rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction.",

This newly formed duct system is similar to the embryonic development of the nasal mucosa [120]. The multilayered epithelium typically contains mucous cells and mucin-filled microcysts. The invagination of the mucosa may result in the presence of apparently discontinuous cell masses lying deep to the epithelial surface, but the basement membrane is intact and may be shown in continuity with that of the surface epithelium [121]. An inverted growth is the hallmark of inverted papilloma, but varying degrees of papillary growth may be seen at the surface (Fig. 2.27) [116]. The surface is characteristically lined by respiratory type of epithelium; nevertheless, foci of surface keratinization are occasionally present [114]. A few regular mitoses may be found in the basal and parabasal layers. Although the nuclei may show mild nuclear irregularities and hyperchromatism, no disturbances of the cellular polarity are found. An abundant and edematous connective tissue stroma is a common feature of inverted papillomas. It usually contains macrophages and neutrophils, but eosinophils may also be present. This inflammatory infiltrate may also be present between the epithelial cells, within the dilated lumens of invaginated crypts and within the numerous microcysts that usually occur in the respiratory epithelium (Fig. 2.28). Seromucinous glands are absent, but branching gland ducts are often present. The tumor grows by extension to involve the contiguous sinonasal epithelium [122].\n\n",

Therefore, lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy are advisable for tumors of the lateral nasal wall [123]. Carcinoma develops in about 10\u201315 % of inverted papillomas [114, 123, 124]. Carcinoma may coexist with inverted papilloma at the initial presentation or originate subsequently [114, 122, 125\u2013127]. According to the experience of Michaels and Hellquist [128], carcinoma does not usually develop in the course of recurrences of inverted papilloma. The presence of severe atypia or marked keratinization in an inverted papilloma is always suspicious of malignant transformation. In these instances, the entire specimen should be thoroughly examined to exclude an associated carcinoma. Most associated carcinomas are squamous and less often undifferentiated (Figs. 2.29 and 2.30) [129]; other types may also occur such as verrucous carcinoma [130]. Carcinoma associated with ISP has a 60 % 10-year survival rate [131].\n\n",

These vessels resemble those normally seen in the submucosa of the nasal conchae. The vascular elements are embedded in fibrous tissue which varies in cellularity and collagenization. Stellate fibroblast-like cells are often present close to the blood vessels. The tumor cells express vimentin and the vascular endothelial cells CD31 and CD34. Pericytes that surround parts of small blood vessels stain for smooth muscle actin. The nuclei of fibroblastic cells of juvenile angiofibroma are strongly positive for testosterone receptors [180]. Ultrastructurally the nuclei of angiofibroma contain characteristic dense granules [181]. Occasionally, the fibroblasts may exhibit cytologic atypia, and some of these cells may be multinucleated, but mitosis are rare. Mast cells may be numerous. There may be focal thrombosis, hemorrhage, and chronic inflammatory reaction. With the advent of preoperative selective embolization, iatrogenic emboli may be encountered in resected specimens (Fig. 2.38) [182].

High-risk HPV has been recently related to SNUC [260].\n",

Due to the undifferentiated appearance of cells in NPC and PSNPC, these tumors may be lumped together with SNUC if unaware of their differences [256, 259, 261]. SNUC does not arise in the nasopharynx, but bulky lesions may extend into this region. Also NPC may extend from the nasopharynx into the sinonasal region. The distinction between these tumors can generally be made on purely histological grounds, since SNUC lacks the lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate seen in most cases of NPC and PSNPC. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization are of great help in difficult cases. All three, NPC, PSNPC, and SNUC, react positively for low molecular weight cytokeratins and EMA. In contrast, NPC and PSNPC are positive for EBV, whereas SNUC is negative. Until very recently, confusion of NPC and PSNPC with SNUC has led to the belief that some SNUCs were related to EBV. The sharp distinction of these entities is crucial because NPC and PSNPC have a better prognosis and are more responsive to radiation therapy than SNUC. HPV-related lymphoepithelial-like NKSCC is another entity to be distinguished from PSNPC.",

The differential diagnosis in the sinonasal tract includes SNUC, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma. Among non-epithelial neoplasms, olfactory neuroblastoma, Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and hematolymphoid tumors can be considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of NUT carcinoma requires either the immunohistochemical demonstration of nuclear reactivity for NUT, which has a characteristic speckled pattern [290], or the demonstration of NUTM1 rearrangement by FISH or PCR. Other markers that may be useful in the differential diagnosis with the abovementioned entities are p63, which is diffusely positive in NUT carcinoma, but not in SNUC and neuroendocrine carcinoma, and neuroendocrine markers, which are not expressed or only focally expressed by NUT carcinoma.",

Metaplastic and atypical changes have been observed in adjacent preneoplastic epithelium [314]. These tumors depict different histological patterns that may be predominantly (a) papillary, (b) glandular, (c) compact, (d) mucinous, and (e) mixed [312, 315]. Papillary tumors mainly consist of elongated outgrowths lined by intestinal-type cells with markedly atypical pseudostratified nuclei (Fig. 2.57). Although most of them are high-grade tumors, low-grade forms mimicking colonic villous adenoma may occasionally occur (Fig. 2.58) [316]. The glandular pattern resembles common-type intestinal adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2.59). Compact or solid forms show poorly differentiated nests of cells in which glandular formation is rarely seen. In the mucinous pattern, more than 50 % of the tumor is composed of dilated mucin-filled glands lined by columnar mucin-secreting epithelium and lakes of mucin containing fragmented epithelial elements (Fig. 2.60). Other mucinous tumors show mucin-filled cells with the pattern of \u201csignet ring\u201d cell carcinoma.

Recognition of invasion may be difficult in these cases. Quite similar tumors also develop in the nasopharynx [332]. The tubulopapillary carcinoma consists of a proliferation of cuboidal to columnar of epithelial cells, forming tubules at the center and papillae at the surface [333]; it has to be differentiated from the terminal tubulus adenocarcinoma of the nasal seromucous glands (Fig. 2.62) [334]. Tumors with glandular pattern may simulate adenoma; nevertheless, the presence of closely packed glands, forming back-to-back arrangements, indicates the true malignant nature of the lesion [335]. Papillary structures may be occasionally noted within dilated glandular structures. In a recent report, one-third of the cases were associated with respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma, but the significance of this finding is yet to be determined [336]. The clear cell pattern is best exemplified by the nasal renal cell-like adenocarcinoma, which consists of cuboidal to polyhedral cells with abundant clear cytoplasms, forming either solid or glandular patterns that mimic clear cell renal carcinoma [337].\n\n",

The lack of lobular architecture; presence of epithelial tufting and papillae, \u201cback-to-back\u201d glands, areas with cribriform or trabecular pattern; and invasion of normal structures support the diagnosis of low-grade non-ITAC [42]. Respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma is characterized by gland-like structures lined by ciliated respiratory-type epithelium that originate from the surface epithelium of the sinonasal tract. In addition, mucinous tumors have to be distinguished from mucoceles [339, 340]. Low-grade non-ITAC can be separated from high-grade non-ITAC based on the lack of marked cellular pleomorphism, necrosis, and brisk mitotic activity. Tubulopapillary ITAC can be ruled out with the help of immunohistochemistry for markers of intestinal differentiation, including cytokeratin 20, CDX2, MUC2, and villin. Salivary-type adenocarcinomas to be ruled out include acinic cell carcinoma [341] and low-grade salivary duct carcinoma of salivary glands [342]. The renal cell-like adenocarcinoma has to be separated from the salivary-type tumors with clear cells and from metastatic renal carcinoma [337, 343] and from the very rare clear cell variant of olfactory neuroblastoma, another mimicker of renal cell carcinoma [344]. Immunohistochemistry may help in this latter distinction, because vimentin and RCC are usually positive in clear cell renal carcinoma, while both markers are negative in sinonasal renal cell-like adenocarcinoma [337, 343].\n",

Sinonasal PMMMs account for less than 1 % of all melanomas and for less than 5 % of all sinonasal malignancies [386\u2013389]. Although most series report a similar gender distribution, others indicate a slightly increased incidence in males [390, 391]. The tumors develop primarily between the fifth and eighth decades of life with a median age of presentation at approximately 60 years [391, 392]. They originate from melanocytes present in the mucosa of the respiratory tract (Fig. 2.73) [384, 385, 388]. In our experience, it is not uncommon to see melanoma arising in an area of squamous metaplasia (Fig. 2.74). In contrast to Caucasian, black Africans often show visible pigmentation at sites corresponding with the common locations of intranasal melanomas, for which they have a higher incidence [393].\n\n",

The maxillary sinus is the most commonly affected paranasal cavity, followed by the ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses. Concurrent nasal and paranasal lesions are infrequent.

Metastatic disease needs to be ruled out, before they are labeled as primary tumors. Primary melanomas may be recognized by the presence of junctional activity or by the finding of an intraepithelial component in the adjacent mucosa; nevertheless, these features are usually lost in sinonasal mucosa because of the thinness of the surface epithelium and frequent ulceration in advanced stages of the disease. Melanomas are composed of medium- to large-sized cells that may be polyhedral, round, fusiform, pleomorphic, microcytic, or a mixture of them. Usually, they have finely granular cytoplasm and nuclei with one or more eosinophilic nucleoli. Mitotic activity is prominent. A rare balloon cell variant with clear cytoplasm may mimic the various sinonasal salivary gland-type clear cell tumors. Osteocartilaginous differentiation has also been observed [403]. The cells of sinonasal melanoma grow in either solid, loosely cohesive, storiform, pseudo-alveolar, or organoid patterns [388]. Two-thirds of sinonasal melanomas contain some intracytoplasmic brown pigment [388], which has to be confirmed as melanin (Fig. 2.76). In the sinonasal tract, nonpigmented melanomas are not uncommon; in our series in Barcelona, up to 40 % of the sinonasal melanomas are amelanotic (Fig. 2.77). When melanin is scarce or is not found, diagnosis may be difficult, and special techniques are mandatory. Electron microscopy reveals the presence of premelanosomes and/or melanosomes (Fig. 2.78).\n\n\n",

Patients with lower Ki-67 scores showed better survival than those with higher Ki-67 scores [416]. The utility of radiotherapy is controversial but it can be of use in unresectable cases or to control recurrences [415, 417]. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy are also used for metastatic disease [414]. Five-year survival of sinonasal PMMM ranges reportedly between 17 and 47 % [389, 394, 414, 415, 418].

The low-grade pattern comprises grades I\u2013II of Hyams and the high-grade pattern grades III\u2013IV. The low-grade pattern is seen most often, and it presents lobular arrangements with well-defined groups of tumor cells separated by abundant edematous and variably vascularized stroma (Fig. 2.80). Prominent vascularization may cause bleeding at the time of biopsy. The neoplastic neuroblasts are typically small, showing round to oval nuclei with stippled chromatin, absent or small nucleoli, and minimal cytoplasm; occasionally clear cell type cytoplasms may be found. Neuroblasts are commonly separated by a neurofibrillary matrix formed by neuronal cell processes, in which axons may be demonstrable (Fig. 2.81). This background, seen in about 85 % of ONB, is the most helpful diagnostic feature. Homer Wright pseudorosettes are quite characteristic of ONB; however, they are less commonly seen. They form when the tumor cells surround the neurofibrillary matrix in collar-like arrangements. Perivascular pseudorosettes, formed by tumor cells arranged around capillaries, are of no diagnostic value, for they may be found in several types of neoplasms.\n\n\n",

True olfactory Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes are only seen in grade III ONBs; this uncommon type of rosettes depicts well-defined lumina lined by columnar cells resembling olfactory epithelium. These cells generally have basally located nuclei and merge with the adjacent neuroblasts without any intervening basal lamina. Grade IV ONBs are anaplastic tumors and usually show pleomorphic nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, increased mitotic rate, and conspicuous necrosis [427]. Very rarely, ONB may exhibit melanocytic or rhabdomioblastic differentiation [430\u2013432]. Exceptional examples of mixed ONB and carcinoma have also been reported [433].\n",

In tumors with a nesting pattern, S-100 protein is positive in the peripheral sustentacular cells. Cytokeratin is generally negative, although in ONB with nesting pattern, a few tumors may exhibit focal staining for low molecular weight CKs. EMA is negative. Neurofilament protein and other markers of neural differentiation are more often expressed in tumors with diffuse, sheetlike pattern [421, 434\u2013436]. Electron microscopy shows evidence of neuroblastic differentiation, demonstrating neuritic processes, neurotubules, and membrane-bound dense-core granules (Fig. 2.84) [437\u2013439]. The human analogue of achaete-scute gene HASH1, expressed in immature olfactory neurons, is also expressed in olfactory neuroblastoma [440]. Conversely the olfactory marker protein [441], expressed exclusively in mature olfactory neurons, is not. ONB lacks CD 99 (MIC-2) expression [429, 442]. In a recent study, intense expression of olfactory-specific sensory transduction proteins was found in ONB, indicating that ONB and olfactory sensory neurons share the same lineage and that the detected transduction proteins could serve as specific tumor markers [443].\n\n",

In advanced ONB, high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation have been used [447, 448]. Staging of ONB is based on the Kadish system [449], in which stage A disease is confined to the nasal cavity, stage B is confined to the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, and stage C shows local or distant spread beyond the nasal cavity or sinuses; most tumors present in stage C. This correlates with survival, which is about 90 % for stage A, 70 % for stage B, and 40 % for stage C [449]. Recognizing the poor prognostic implications of regional and distant metastatic disease, adding cervical lymphadenopathy and distant metastasis as a fourth, stage D category was suggested [445], which showed a worse disease-free survival specifically for the D category [450] (Table 2.8). Necrosis is the single histological feature that seems to correlate with poor survival [420]. About two-thirds of recurrences are in the form of local disease, whereas locoregional recurrences, with intracranial extension or involvement of cervical lymph nodes, represent about 20 %, and distant metastases account for the rest [423, 451]. Distant metastases mainly involve the bone and lung [448].\n",

Patients may present either with an obstructive mass or with midfacial destructive lesions.

In extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma, cells may be small, medium sized, large, or anaplastic and may show a conspicuous admixture of inflammatory cells (Fig. 2.90). Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the covering epithelium may occur, and when exaggerated, it should not be confused with squamous cell carcinoma [471]. Extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma is almost always associated with EBV positivity. The most typical immunophenotype is CD2+, CD56+, surface CD3\u2212, and cytoplasmic CD3\u03b5+. Most cases are also positive for cytotoxic granule associated proteins (granzyme B, TIA-1, and perforin). Other T- and NK-cell-associated markers are usually negative. Sinonasal lymphomas demonstrating CD3\u03b5+, CD56\u2212, cytotoxic molecule+, and EBV+ are also included within the NK/T category.

The epithelial component includes keratinizing and non-keratinizing squamous epithelium, pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium, and glandular structures lined by either cuboidal or columnar cells that may show mucous differentiation (Fig. 2.96). Nests of immature squamous cells containing clear cells which are \u201cfetal appearing\u201d are a common finding and an important diagnostic clue [539]. The carcinomatous component is usually glandular, but sometimes squamous. Neuroepithelial elements with rosettes and neuroblastoma-like areas are in most instances present (Fig. 2.97). These epithelial and neuroepithelial elements occur in close relationship with each other and with mesenchymal elements. The most prominent mesenchymal elements are immature cells with oval or elongated nuclei. The mesenchymal cells may exhibit skeletal muscle differentiation with cross striations and bizarre formations (Fig. 2.98). Foci of cartilage, smooth muscle, adipose tissue, and fibrovascular tissues may also be present. There may be proliferation of small round cells that are difficult to classify. Mitotic activity and cytological features of malignancy are demonstrable in the undifferentiated areas of both the epithelial and mesenchymal elements [540].\n\n\n\n",
