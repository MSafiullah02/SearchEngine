The viruses investigated included those that cause respiratory diseases (eg, influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial, corona, parainfluenza types 1-3, and adenovirus) and those that could possibly be used as bioterrorism agents (eg, orthopox, entero, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Machupo, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses). After eluting collected materials from the HVAC filters, we attempted to detect these viruses by virus isolation in cell cultures and specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and by the detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or DNA by PCR.",

The 2 buildings were of similar size, had the same occupancy density, and were used for the same purpose. The 2 cities were chosen to observe any differences due to climate. The buildings were equipped with numerous air-handling units (AHUs) to maintain indoor temperature and humidity levels and maintain indoor air quality in accordance with American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standards.27 Each AHU was fitted with a set of prefilters and final filters, the number of which depended on the volume of air being processed. Both filters were designed to be dust filters (tested against American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard 52.1: dust-spot efficiency test). Both the prefilters and final filters were constructed from fiberglass or synthetic material, designed to not support microbial growth. The pleated prefilters (60 cm \u00d7 60 cm \u00d7 3 cm) were designed to capture large particles from the air (with \u223c30% efficiency). The final filters were bag-type filters (60 cm2 \u00d7 60 cm2) consisting of 8-10 bags per filter, designed to capture smaller particles that escape the prefilters.",

AHUs S-18 and S-23 from building M processed 100% outdoor air, whereas the remaining AHUs in the 2 buildings processed a mixture of indoor and outdoor air. Prefilters and final filters were obtained from both buildings at different times over an 18-month period from August 2004 to December 2005. The period from August 2004 to July 2005 was considered phase I, and that from August 2005 to December 2005 was designated phase II. In phase I, 8 prefilters and 8 final filters were obtained and tested from building M only. Phase II included building S, and a total of 48 prefilters and final filters from both buildings were obtained and tested (Table 1).",
