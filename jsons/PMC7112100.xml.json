            "text": "Among all the factors, land use activities is a major factor in shaping waterborne viromes. Land use changes are the primary drivers of the viral community and a range of associated infectious waterborne disease outbreaks (Patz et al. 2004, 2008). In the water cycle, agriculture brings excess nutrients and agricultural chemicals to surface waters, causing oxygen depletion and increasing algal blooms (Foley et al., 2005). Urbanization degrades water quality through surface runoff, and human pathogenic viruses have been detected more frequently in watersheds with dominant urban and agricultural land cover (Corsi et al., 2014; Lenaker et al., 2017). Furthermore, human expansion into wildlife habitats or construction of zoos and animal parks provide opportunities for human-wildlife interactions, thus, increasing the risk for the possible transmission of zoonotic viruses to human populations (Patz et al., 2008). These different anthropogenic activities harbor diverse and distinct viral hosts, including bacteria, plants, wild animals and humans. It is hypothesized that the environment surrounding these reservoirs may favor distinct viral predators and further change the viral community characterization. However, up till now, studies of land use impacts on the virome community in freshwater ecosystems are still limited as they mainly rely on traditional methodology (culture-based method or qPCR/RT-qPCR), which focuses on limited human virus targets without considering the whole picture of the viral community in the water environment (Corsi et al., 2014; Lenaker et al., 2017). To date, there is no systematic report focusing on the geospatial distribution and diversity of viromes in natural surface waters and how they may be impacted by human activities and the effect of different land use. In addition, emerging viral pathogens of zoonotic origin could also be discovered through viral metagenomics, for which information is very limited.",

As such, good water quality is needed to protect recreational users of these water bodies.

By conducting a complete virome analysis of these freshwater ecosystems (especially viral pathogens and fecal viral indicators), a comprehensive picture of the links between the virome community structure and specific land use activities could be elucidated and thus, used to conduct risk assessment of associated waterborne disease.

The hollow fiber ultrafilter was purged with nanopure water for 5 min and pre-treated with 500 mL of blocking solution (0.1 g of NaPP in 1 L of nanopure water) for 15 min. After that, the water sample was recirculated until a final volume of approximately 200\u2013250 mL was reached.

Both retentate and eluent were combined to a final volume of 600 mL during primary concentration. 200 mL of primary concentrate was further processed to enrich viral particles in a secondary concentration step through polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (10% PEG 8000 (w/v) and 0.3M NaCl) after pH adjustment (pH = 7.2) (Jaykus et al., 1996). After incubation of the mixture at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h followed by 14,000 g for 45 min, the pellet was dissolved in 10 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH7.2) with an equal volume of chloroform. After centrifugation at 3000 g for 45 min, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm sterile syringe and further concentrated to a final volume of 1 mL using a 30 kDa ultracentrifugal filter device (Merck Millipore, Ireland).

It was also noted that the viral species richness from tributaries was also lower than their corresponding reservoirs. The average Shannon diversity of reservoirs and tributaries was computed as 10.4 and 8.4 respectively and a one-way ANOVA test showed that the Shannon-diversity of tributaries was significantly smaller than those from reservoirs (P < 0.05). This indicated that tributaries were more likely to be dominated by selected species compared to the reservoirs (Fig. S2) and this may be related to the viral host's presence (e.g., bacteria, archaea, algae, insects, plants, animals).

This is because some phages can convey new properties of coding for toxin production to the host bacteria, thus converting harmless bacteria into pathogens (Grabow, 2001), for example, the shiga toxin-converting phages have been known to change the pathogenicity of E. coli O157:H7 (Muniesa and Jofre, 2000).",

Enterobacteriaceae occurred more in tributaries, which may contribute to the distribution and abundance of Microviridae in tributaries. The hosts of Dicistroviridae are soil-inhabiting invertebrates (e.g., aphids and ants, which are common in tropical Singapore).

This could be expected as intensive agriculture has been reported to bring nutrients and agricultural chemicals to the water cycle (Foley et al., 2005), which in turn, disturbs the microbial community indirectly (Tseng et al., 2013). Agricultural intensification has been associated with pathogen emergence transmission between wildlife and domestic animal populations and human populations, which in turn, could increase the species of zoonotic viruses (Pulliam et al., 2012). Jones et al. (2008) concluded that agricultural practices are one of the socioeconomic drivers in the spatial distribution of emerging infectious diseases. However, the non-significant correlation between diversity and other land use types does not necessarily suggest weak connections between the viral community and land use factor, since \u03b1-diversity indices (Shannon diversity and Observed species) are just one aspect of characterizing the viral community and does not necessarily represent a complete view. \u03b2-diversity analysis indicated that Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae were enriched in reservoirs of parkland areas while Dicistroviridae and Microviridae were enriched in tributaries of urban areas (Fig. 3A). Siphoviridae, Podoviridae and Microviridae belong to bacteriophage, which may be associated with parkland and urban enriched bacteria (i.e., Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria) in our study (Fig. 3E).",

These differences could be due to the geographical (latitudinal gradient) differences in microbial diversity, as low-latitude tropical ecosystems tend to lead to higher biological diversity (Chown and Convey, 2007; Fuhrman et al., 2008). Kim et al. (2016) reported that viruses had higher richness near the equator and lower richness at higher latitude, similar to human pathogen species (Guernier et al., 2004). However, these comparisons between the diversity in freshwater virome studies need further confirmation due to different indices used (chao1, Simpson index, Shannon index, and observed species) and diverse calculation methods applied (e.g., PHACCs, QIIME, Catchall). By using PHACCs based on the contig spectra generated by Circonspect, Tseng et al. (2013) derived a Shannon diversity (H) range from 5.1 to 7 and from 7.8k to 21.8k viral genotypes in one subtropical freshwater reservoir, which was lower than the ocean's virome Shannon diversity in British Columbia, the Gulf of Mexico and the Sargasso Sea (H of 10.8, 8.21 and 7.74, respectively) (Angly et al., 2009). The difference in methods used in published papers makes it difficult to draw comparable conclusions. A standard pipeline in deriving the viral diversity in ecology is required in order to make comparisons of viral diversity across diverse aquatic ecosystems from different studies.",

Even though the viral communities at the family level were conserved across different reservoirs, the PCoA plots suggested a dynamic shift in differences between contig levels of the viral community in terms of land use. The geospatial distribution patterns in the surface water environment could have resulted from both direct and indirect factors. On the one hand, the different land use patterns could also introduce foreign viral contamination into water bodies directly through urban/agriculture runoff, precipitation, leaking sewers, etc., while the viral community itself can be indirectly changed and characterized by the relationship to their hosts in specific environments. The runoff from the surrounding areas can also bring specific bacteria, or other vectors and nutrients into the reservoirs and the tributaries (Tseng et al., 2013). Even though previous studies have shown the correlation between land use and water-borne viral pathogens (Corsi et al., 2014; Lenaker et al., 2017), ours is the first study correlating land use cover with the whole viral community, thus overcoming the limitations of investigating specific viruses and providing comprehensive information on the community structure with the relationship of land use cover.",

As metagenomics can only provide relative abundance, further studies are needed using qPCR in order to determine absolute concentrations and to better evaluate health risks.",

A large proportion was found to belong to swan circoviruses (59%) and Circoviridae 2 LDMD-2013 (30%). Two contigs found in the present study were assigned to the suggested cyclovirus-VN which originated from human samples in Vietnam (\nGarigliany et al., 2014). Indeed, cyclovirus VN was initially reported to be restricted to central and southern Vietnam but was subsequently detected in both farm animals and human clinical samples from Africa, indicating their geographic transmission capacity (Garigliany et al., 2014; van Doorn et al., 2013). In Singapore, human cyclovirus VS5700009 (CyCV-VS5700009) was previously found in Singapore harbor water by using a metagenomics approach (Kim et al., 2016). The contig 89154 shared a 97.79% nucleotide similarity with human cyclovirus VN (KF031466) with a query coverage of 98.15%. The discovery of cyclovirus VN in freshwater tributaries in the densely populated area of Site 2 in our study indicates a possible transmission of the emerging human cyclovirus in the Singapore urban water cycle. Further risk assessment of host populations should be conducted for these water environments (van Doorn et al., 2013).",

The exception of reservoir 6 (explained in Results 3.1) suggested that drainage points could also be significant drivers in shaping the viral communities as well as land use cover and population density. Higher population density could result in high occurrence of human-related viruses (Lenaker et al., 2017). Here, the population density to some extent could reflect the hotspots of human-related viruses. Limitation of using population density to quantify human activities and human-related viral hosts in our study exists as the population density referred to is the resident population. However, the mobile population such as those associated with modern transportation, tourism, business travel and immigration could also contribute to dissemination of these high-impact pathogens (Arguin et al., 2009). In addition, public holidays could introduce variation in population numbers to commercial and recreational areas based on lifestyle choices. Thereafter, more detailed data will be needed in order to track and investigate the human-related virus transmission patterns through virus-host interaction.",

In contrast with our freshwater ecosystem, a previous study of sewage sludge samples revealed a large number of human viral pathogens, unveiling 43 types of human viruses (Bibby and Peccia, 2013). This result is expected as the sludge matrix harbors large amounts of human-related viruses and the concentrations of viral pathogens are much higher.",

This suggests that viral metagenomics, to some extent, is a conservative estimate of the true viral abundance, based on validation of RT-qPCR data with RPKM in relative abundance of contigs, especially for contigs with a higher qPCR concentration. Similar results were also obtained in a previous study where a significant correlation (p < 0.0001) between qPCR and RPKM across viral taxa in clinical samples was obtained (Graf et al., 2016). Overall, viral metagenomics has its advantage in the simultaneous discovery of the entire set of targets in the community in spite of the intrinsic limitation of downstream bioinformatics (i.e., assembly efficiency and database bias). It can pave the way in finding emerging zoonotic viruses and alternative plausible fecal indicators in predicting viral pathogens in the future. After zooming into the specific and desired targets using high throughput sequencing, gene-specific PCR or qPCR (e.g., cyclovirus-VN) could be further investigated to confirm the presence of these potential viral pathogens and zoonotic viruses to reveal the epidemiology or transmission patterns of these viral pathogens (Kim et al., 2015).",

Correlations between the diversity index, physical-chemical parameters and land use patterns showed that environmental parameters (i.e., pH and precipitation) and spatial factors (e.g., reservoirs/tributaries, land use) are the main drivers of the viral community structure. Although enteric viruses were not detected by viral metagenomics, human-related viruses, including emerging zoonotic viruses, were detected in our samples indicating the importance of continued monitoring of these environments where specific hosts could be harbored. In addition, the links between qPCR/RT-qPCR and metagenomics were shown using both contigs and reads, confirming that our metagenomics quantification path is reliable and scientific. Even though metagenomics sequencing technology cannot replace qPCR/RT-qPCR due to its relatively low sensitivity in detecting gene-specific viral pathogens, its wide coverage of viral targets could add valuable information, such as detecting new, emerging zoonotic viruses and finding alternative fecal indicators or markers of contamination.",
