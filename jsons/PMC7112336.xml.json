Moreover, many viruses including H5N1 mutate readily and produce resistant strains that are no longer controlled by vaccines or antiviral drugs. The pathology of ARDS in SARS-coronavirus (Lew et al., 2003) and H5N1 avian influenza virus infections (Beigel et al., 2005, Peiris et al., 2004) is characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells, edema formation, and a marked increase in cytokines. The same clinical syndrome of acute lung failure is observed in multiple other pathogenic conditions including sepsis, gastric acid aspiration, or pulmonary infections with Anthrax spores (Hudson et al., 1995, Guarner et al., 2003). Similar ARDS symptoms can be observed in multiple species ranging from birds, rodents, tigers, and primates to humans. Given the common pathology, we wondered whether there might be a conserved injury pathway for ARDS.",

Acid aspiration in mice results in rapid impairment of lung function as determined by increased lung elastance, a measure of the change in pressure achieved per unit change in volume, representing the stiffness of the lungs, decreased blood oxygenation, and alveolar wall thickening, bleeding, inflammatory cell infiltration, and formation of hyaline membranes (Figures S1A\u2013S1C available online). The severity of acid-induced ALI was comparable among various inbred mouse strains with one exception: C3H/HeJ mice exhibited reduced lung elastance. Moreover, C3H/HeJ mice exhibited better blood oxygenation and reduced inflammation (Figures S1A\u2013S1C).",

To test whether this TLR4 mutation might be involved in ALI severity, we assessed acid-induced ALI in C3H/HeOuJ mice, a C3H-congenic mouse strain that expresses wild-type (WT) TLR4. The resistance to ALI of C3H/HeJ mice was lost in C3H/HeOuJ mice (Figures S1A\u2013S1D). To confirm that TLR4 determines disease severity, we triggered acid-mediated ALI in tlr4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Hoshino et al., 1999). Genetic inactivation of tlr4 markedly attenuated ALI as determined by improved lung elastance (\nFigure 1A), reduced edema formation (Figure 1B), and ameliorated histological changes (Figure 1C). Bone marrow chimeras showed that the severity of ALI is controlled by TLR4 expression on hematopoietic cells (Figures 1D\u20131F). Lung pathology were not affected in tlr3 (Yamamoto et al., 2003) or tlr9 (Hemmi et al., 2000) mutant mice (Figures S2A and S2B). These data identify TLR4 as a susceptibility gene for ALI.",

Surprisingly, genetic deletion of myd88 (Adachi et al., 1998) had no apparent effect on the severity of ALI (Figures S2C and S2D). In contrast, trif\u2212/\u2212 mice (Yamamoto et al., 2003) exhibited markedly improved lung function (\nFigure 2A), lung pathology (Figure 2B), and lung edema (Figure S3A). TRIF signals either through IKK-\u025b and activation of IRF3 or via TRAF6-mediated NF-\u03baB activation (Sato et al., 2003). To dissect the TLR4-TRIF activation pathway, we conducted experiments using irf3 and traf6 knockout mice. Deletion of irf3 (Sato et al., 2000) did not show a significant change in acid-mediated ALI (Figures S2E and S2F). We next generated myeloid cell-specific traf6 mutant mice using Lys-Cre-mediated deletion of a TRAF6flox/flox allele (TRAF6MC-KO). Deletion of TRAF6 was confirmed in cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (Figure 2C). Inactivation of TRAF6 in TRAF6MC-KO mice resulted in alleviation of ALI (Figures 2D, 2E, and S3B). To determine whether mutations of TLR4, TRIF, or TRAF6 affect NF-\u03baB activation, we performed in situ signaling experiments to detect nuclear accumulation of Ser276-phosphorylated NF-\u03baBp65 indicative of NF-\u03baB activation (Vermeulen et al., 2002). Whereas acid aspiration triggered NF-\u03baBp65 activation in WT and myd88\u2212/\u2212 mice, much less nuclear NF-\u03baBp65 translocation occurred in lungs from tlr4\u2212/\u2212, trif\u2212/\u2212, or TRAF6MC-KO mice (Figure 2F). NF-\u03baB activation was largely restricted to macrophages. Taken together, our genetic results identify TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6-NF-\u03baB as a key signaling pathway that links acid injury to the severity of ALI.",

The molecular basis of how such cytokine storms are mediated by local injury and whether such injury-released cytokines actually contribute to disease severity of ARDS are still unknown. To examine whether TLR4 signaling may be involved in local cytokine, we performed multiple cytokine arrays from normal lungs and lung tissue following acid aspiration. The cytokines IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and KC (IL-8) were upregulated by acid treatment in WT mice, but we failed to observe upregulation of TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-17, RANTES, IL-9, Eotaxin, or MIP-1\u03b2 (Figure S4 and data not shown). IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1 were below the detection limit of our assay. IL-10 negatively correlated with the severity of ALI (Figure S4E). In particular, IL-6 levels closely reflected the severity of ALI in resistant tlr4\u2212/\u2212, trif\u2212/\u2212, and TRAF6MC-KO mice and injury-prone mice myd88\u2212/\u2212 and irf3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2G). To test if IL-6 is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of ALI, we studied il-6\u2212/\u2212 mice (Kopf et al., 1994). In response to acid aspiration, il-6\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significant improvement of lung function (Figure 2H), lung edema formation (Figure S3C), and decreased lung pathologies (Figure 2I). Although these data do not exclude the importance of other cytokines, our genetic results show that loss of IL-6 alleviates the severity of ALI (Figure 2J).",

To rule out the possibility of LPS contamination, we first treated mice with polymyxin B to neutralize LPS (Jacobs and Morrison, 1977).

Moreover, in line with previous data from our group (Imai et al., 2005) and others (Nagase et al., 2000), instillation of LPS alone into lungs does not worsen lung function in our acute lung failure model (Figure S5B). We next stimulated alveolar macrophages from WT, tlr4\u2212/\u2212, myd88\u2212/\u2212, or trif\u2212/\u2212 mice with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from normal mice (BAL control), BAL fluid from lungs of acid-treated WT mice (BAL acid), or LPS. In line with our genetic data, BAL fluid-induced IL-6 production was mediated via TLR4 and TRIF, but not MyD88 (\nFigure 3A). By contrast, LPS-induced IL-6 production in alveolar macrophages was dependent on TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF (Figure 3A). Thus, other TLR4-activating agents rather than LPS are generated during the course of ALI.",

To demonstrate the role of OxPLs in vivo we used the well-characterized mAb EO6 (Friedman et al., 2002). This mAb specifically detects the phosphocholine (PC) headgroup of phospholipids in which the sn2 side chain has been oxidized but does not recognize native nonoxidized PLs. We observed large amounts of EO6-detectable OxPLs in the BAL fluid of acid-challenged animals (Figure S5C). In situ immunohistochemistry confirmed the generation of EO6-detectable OxPLs in alveolar macrophages as well as inflammatory exudates lining the injured air spaces (Figure 3D). In addition, we observed formation of the lipid peroxidation breakdown product malondialdehyde detected by the specific mAb MDA2 (Palinski et al., 1996) (Figure S5D), further confirming that lipid oxidation does occur in diseased lungs. These data show that acid aspiration triggers the oxidative stress machinery and the generation of OxPLs in lung.",

            "text": "The major source of PLs in the lung is surfactant, which forms a film at the alveolar air-water interface and reduces surface tension. Surfactant contains 80%\u201390% PLs including unsaturated phosphatidylcholine that can be oxidized (Rodriguez Capote et al., 2003, Veldhuizen et al., 1998). In vitro-oxidized surfactant PLs contain EO6-detectable OxPLs (Figure S6D). Addition of purified synthetically oxidized surfactant PLs induced IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner in WT peritoneal macrophages (Figure 3F). IL-6 production in response to surfactant OxPLs was decreased by the neutralizing mAb EO6 (data not shown) and dependent on TLR4 expression (Figure 3F). In line with previous results (Bailey et al., 2004), in vivo administration of nonoxidized PLs induces slightly impaired lung function (Figure 3G). Intratracheal administration of OxPLs markedly worsened lung function in normal mice (Figure 3G). In a second experimental model, we removed endogenous surfactant via saline lavages, which strongly impairs lung function; we followed this with intratracheal replacement with nonoxidized or oxidized surfactant PLs. In this scenario, challenge with OxPLs resulted in much more severe impairment of lung function and all experimental animals died by 2 hr, whereas mice that received control, nonmodified surfactant PLs stabilized their lung function (Figure S7A). Lung function was comparable among WT and tlr4\u2212/\u2212 mice following administration of nonoxidized surfactant PLs. Loss of TLR4 expression markedly alleviated the severe lung failure phenotype following OxPLs treatment (Figure 3H). Moreover, administration of OxPLs induced increased levels of IL-6 in the lungs of WT control but not in those of tlr4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure S7B). These data indicate that synthetically oxidized surfactant PLs can trigger cytokine production in macrophages and, importantly, acute lung injury in vivo via TLR4.",

The mAb EO6 we used for the detection of OxPLs has been previously reported to specifically bind PC-containing OxPLs such as oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC) (Figure S7C). We confirmed that the mAB EO6 indeed detects OxPAPC (Figure S8A). To directly test whether OxPAPC can trigger cytokine production via TLR4, we stimulated lung tissue macrophages with OxPAPC and nonoxidized PAPC. Compared to PAPC, OxPAPC induced higher IL-6 levels in WT macrophages, and these levels were attenuated by the neutralizing mAb EO6 (\nFigure 4A). OxPAPC-induced IL-6 production was decreased in tlr4\u2212/\u2212 and trif\u2212/\u2212 lung macrophages, and this residual IL-6 production was not affected by the mAb EO6 (Figure 4B). Similar to our in vivo experiments, OxPAPC could still trigger IL-6 production in myd88\u2212/\u2212 lung tissue macrophages. LPS-induced IL-6 production in lung macrophages was dependent on TLR4, TRIF, and MyD88 (Figure 4B). In addition, OxPAPC induced higher IL-6 production than nonoxidized PAPC in alveolar macrophages isolated by lung lavage (Figure S8B). OxPAPC-induced IL-6 production was decreased in tlr4\u2212/\u2212 alveolar macrophages (Figure S8C). Similar to lung macrophages, OxPAPC triggered IL-6 production in peritoneal macrophages dependent on TLR4 and TRIF but not MyD88 (Figure S8D). Thus, OxPAPC can trigger IL-6 production in lung and peritoneal macrophages via TLR4-TRIF signaling. Importantly, intratracheal administration of OxPAPC induced marked deterioration of lung function in WT mice (Figure 4C). In vivo OxPAPC, but not PAPC, challenges triggered I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation indicative of an activated NF-\u03baB pathway (Figure 4D). Moreover, lung function (Figure 4E) and IL-6 production (Figure S8E) were markedly alleviated in tlr4\u2212/\u2212 and trif\u2212/\u2212 but not myd88\u2212/\u2212 mice. These data indicate that OxPAPC can trigger ALI via TLR4 and TRIF.",

Our data so far showed that acid aspiration triggers production of OxPLs that can augment the severity of ALI and cytokine production via TLR4. We wanted to extend these findings to H5N1-mediated ALI. Inactivated influenza A virus (McKinney et al., 2003) or inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (Haeberle et al., 2002) can induce rapid activation of NF-\u03baB and/or proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. The virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus was largely determined by its hemaglutinin (HA), and the recombinant viruses expressing the 1918 viral HA induce high IL-6 production and severe ALI in vivo (Kobasa et al., 2004). Based on these reports, we tested whether an inactivated H5N1 virus where HA activity is conserved might induce OxPL production and ALI in vivo via TLR4. Since H5N1 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of cytokines in macrophages than H1N1 subtype influenza (Cheung et al., 2002), we used H1N1 as a control.",

Administration of inactivated H1N1 virus had only very mild effects on lung function and lung histology (Figures 5A, 5B, and S9A). In line with a previous study (van Riel et al., 2006), we observed influenza A virus nuclear protein-positive cells in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) in mice treated with inactivated H5N1 virus (Figure 5C). By contrast, we only found very few virus nuclear protein-positive cells in the LRT of H1N1-treated mice (Figure 5C). Similar to acid treatment, we found higher production of ROS in alveolar macrophages isolated from mice treated with inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus (Figure 5D). In addition, TLR4 surface expression was increased in alveolar macrophages from mice treated with inactivated H5N1 (Figure 5E). In vivo challenge of mice with H1N1 did not result in detectable ROS production or upregulation of TLR4 cell-surface expression (Figures 5D and 5E). Moreover, we detected OxPLs in the BAL fluid of animals challenged with inactivated H5N1 (Figure S9B). Immunohistochemistry confirmed enhanced generation of EO6-detectable OxPLs at the sites of injury (Figure S9C). We extended the analysis of OxPLs to live H5N1 infections. Similar to inactivated H5N1 (Figure 5C), influenza virus A protein was detected in the LRT of mice infected with live H5N1 avian influenza virus (Figure 5F). Importantly, infection with live H5N1 avian influenza virus resulted in the formation of EO6-detectable OxPLs in mouse lung (Figure 5F). Thus, challenge of mice with H5N1 avian influenza can trigger OxPLs and rapid onset ALI in vivo.",

In addition, BAL fluid obtained from H5N1-challenged mice induced high levels of IL-6 in WT but not tlr4\u2212/\u2212 alveolar macrophages. Neutralization of OxPLs using the mAb EO6 attenuated IL-6 production in WT but not tlr4\u2212/\u2212 alveolar macrophages (Figure 6F).

Ncf1 is a key component of the NADPH oxidase complex required for oxidative burst and ROS formation (Hultqvist et al., 2004). This ncf1 mutation affects splicing leading to a near absence of Ncf1 protein (Huang et al., 2000). Interestingly, the ncf1 mutant mice treated with inactivated H5N1 virus showed significantly improved lung elastance (Figure 7D), pulmonary edema formation (Figure S10B), and alleviated lung pathologies (Figure 7E) compared with control mice on the same genetic background. Importantly, in H5N1-challenged ncf1\u2212/\u2212 mice we failed to detect oxidized PL formation (Figure 7E).

Thus, in multiple species, infections with various lethal lung pathogens such as H5N1 avian influenza virus, SARS-coronavirus, Anthrax, Y. pestis, or Monkey Pox virus can trigger formation of OxPLs in the lung.

In the classical pathway, MyD88 recruits IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) and TRAF6 leading to activation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 complexes. TRIF signals through IKK-\u025b leading to activation of IRF3 and the expression of IFN-inducible genes. It has been shown that TRAF6 binds to TRIF though TRAF6-binding motifs in the N-terminal portion of TRIF and is involved in TRIF-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB in vitro (Sato et al., 2003). Importantly, our study shows that innate immune signaling via TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 is a key genetic pathway that determines the susceptibility to acute lung failure in vivo. Moreover, our bone marrow transplantation experiments and our LysCre TFAF6 mutant mice show that this pathway operates in myeloid cells, in particular lung macrophages. Since macrophages can utilize both TRIF- and MyD88-dependent pathways for cytokine induction, our data might provide an opportunity to minimize ALI via TRIF inhibition while not affecting MyD88-dependent innate immune functions.",

Recently oxidized moieties, including OxPLs, have been implicated as pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are detected by several conserved pattern-recognition receptors (Binder et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2003b). In particular, minimally oxidized LDL has been found to activate TLR4 on macrophages (Miller et al., 2003a, Miller et al., 2005), though the exact mechanism of this activation remains elusive. However, this connection has been controversial (Bochkov et al., 2002). We therefore used a genetic approach to examine whether TLR4 expression is indeed required for OxPL-induced cytokine production in macrophages in vitro or OxPL-induced ALI in vivo. Our genetic data show that OxPL-mediated cytokine release and OxPL-induced ALI depend on TLR4 expression. Thus, OxPLs can either directly or indirectly activate the TLR4 signaling cascade during the course of lung injury. Consistent with previous reports (Powers et al., 2006, Kurt-Jones et al., 2000), we also found that chemical injury and inactivated H5N1 virus upregulate TLR4 surface expression in macrophages. Thus, local lung injury not only triggers activation of the oxidative stress machinery but also induces upregulation of TLR4 involved in the OxPL-induced acute lung injury response.",

In fact, OxPAPC has been known to be generated at the sites of inflammation and is found in membranes of apoptotic cells (Chang et al., 2004). Furthermore, OxPAPC can play a proinflammatory role in atherosclerosis (Berliner and Watson, 2005, Furnkranz et al., 2005) and impairs the outcome of gram-negative sepsis in vivo (Knapp et al., 2007). Interestingly, in the E. coli-induced peritonitis model, coadministration of OxPAPC also increased the local production of cytokines, e.g., IL-6 (Knapp et al., 2007). On the other hand, anti-inflammatory properties of OxPAPC have been reported in LPS-induced sepsis or ALI, which may be explained by direct antagonism of LPS recognition (Bochkov et al., 2002, Nonas et al., 2006). Besides OxPAPC, other OxPLs might also trigger ALI. Moreover, additional TLR4 ligands are also likely to be present, e.g., modified matrix components, dying cells, hyaluronan, or HMGB1 (Miyake, 2007).",

            "text": "One key question remained, whether oxidative stress is indeed involved in disease pathogenesis of ALI. Our data showed that acid treatment and inactivated H5N1 viruses can trigger ROS formation in mouse alveolar macrophages and human monocytes. Oxidative modifications are also present in all severe lung injuries in all species tested. Of note, gene expression analysis of mice infected with recombinant viruses expressing the 1918 viral HA revealed a high upregulation of ROS-related genes (Kash et al., 2004). We therefore tested H5N1-induced lung injury in ncf1 mutant mice. Ncf1 encodes one of the activating proteins in the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex. Importantly, this genetic defect in ROS production resulted in a significantly reduced lung injury in response to challenge with our inactivated H5N1 virus. Moreover, in H5N1-challenged ncf1 mutant mice we failed to observe EO6-detectable oxidized PLs confirming that Ncf1-regulated oxidative burst is involved in the formation of OxPLs. Thus, activation of the oxidative stress machinery is not simply a by-product of the disease process but controls disease severity.",

Massive formation of OxPLs occurred in all severe cases of acute lung failure we have analyzed including humans who died of H5N1 or SARS infections and animals that developed lethal lung failure due to Y. pestis, Monkey Pox, pulmonary Anthrax, or H5N1 infections. OxPLs such as OxPAPC can directly trigger cytokine production in macrophages and modulate the severity of acute lung injury in vivo dependent on TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 expression. Thus, the acute onset of proinflammatory immune responses and severe lung injury caused by different pathogens critically depends on activation of the oxidative stress machinery that couples to innate immunity (Figure S11). Modulation of this injury pathway, therefore, could be utilized to protect patients infected with H5N1 avian influenza virus, SARS-coronavirus, Anthrax, or other as yet unknown lethal lung pathogens from developing acute severe lung failure.",
