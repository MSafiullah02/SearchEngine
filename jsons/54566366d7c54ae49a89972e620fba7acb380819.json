The transmembrane molecule CD13 is expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and has been shown to mediate homotypic cell adhesion, which may imply a role for CD13 in inflammatory monocyte trafficking. Here, we show that ligation and clustering of CD13 by mAb or viral ligands potently induce myeloid cell/endothelial adhesion in a signal transduction-dependent manner involving monocytic cytoskeletal rearrangement and filopodia formation. Treatment with soluble recombinant (r)CD13 blocks this CD13-dependent adhesion, and CD13 molecules from monocytic and endothelial cells are present in the same immunocomplex, suggesting a direct participation of CD13 in the adhesive interaction. This concept is strengthened by the fact that activated monocytic cells adhere to immobilized recombinant CD13. Furthermore, treatment with anti-CD13 antibodies in a murine model of peritonitis results in a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneum, suggesting a potential role for CD13 in leukocyte trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this work supports a new direction for CD13 biology, where these cell surface molecules act as true molecular interfaces that induce and participate in critical inflammatory cell interactions.

As CD13 is expressed on monocytes and the endothelial cells of tumor vessels [7, 9] , vessels in the ischemic heart [25] , and has been shown to be up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines [26 -29] , we asked if ligation of CD13 would influence the monocyte/ endothelial interactions that are critical to monocyte trafficking during inflammation. Pretreatment of primary HUVEC (which express high levels of CD13 in response to growth factors in the culture medium [8, 9] ) with the anti-CD13 mAb 452 prior to addition of labeled U-937 monocytic cells significantly induced monocytic cell adhesion (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, adhesion was not induced when cells were pretreated with mAb at 4\u00b0C (data not shown), suggesting that the induction of adhesion was an active process and that it was not a result of cell-cell association via unbound Fab portions of the mAb binding to CD13 molecules on the opposite cell. To strengthen this conclusion, we produced stable cell lines expressing the V5 epitope-tagged, full-length hCD13 in a CD13-negative human epithelial cell line C33A (hCD13-C33A) and assayed these for antibody-induced monocytic cell adhesion. Although the high expression of CD13 on these transfectants had no effect on the basal adhesion of monocytic cells (see Fig. 3C ), pretreatment of the hCD13-C33A with anti-CD13 mAb 452 or an anti-V5 antibody was capable of inducing similar increases in adhesion over a wide range of doses, although maximal induction was observed with low antibody concentrations (Fig. 1B) . As the V5 epitope is only expressed by the cells in the monolayer, this result clearly demonstrates that anti-CD13-dependent adhesion is not the result of single antibodies simultaneously binding to the CD13 on both cell populations but more likely by influencing the intrinsic, adhesive properties of the cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 297, "end": 300, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 301, "end": 303, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 407, "end": 415, "text": "[26 -29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 815, "end": 824, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1496, "text": "Fig. 3C", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1741, "text": "(Fig. 1B)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "CD13 engagement induces monocytic cell/endothelial adhesion"}, {"text": "We expanded our investigation using three additional anti-CD13 mAb of varying epitope specificities to pretreat HUVEC (summarized in Table 1 ). Maximal induction of monocytic cell-endothelial cell adhesion was observed with two independent mAb, 452 and Y2-K (Fig. 1C ), which recognize a common epitope (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) that has been shown to be important for HCoV-229E infection [20] . In contrast, pretreat-ment of HUVEC with the WM-15 mAb that recognizes a distinct epitope and inhibits CD13 enzymatic activity [31] showed a more modest, yet significant induction of monocytic cell adhesion. A third reagent, mAb WM-4.7, does not inhibit viral infection, does not block enzymatic activity [31, 32] , and as expected, had no effect on monocytic cell adhesion to HUVEC, nor did treatment of cells with bestatin, a chemical inhibitor of CD13 enzymatic activity. Interestingly, pretreatment of the adhering monocytic cells with anti-CD13 mAb prior to addition of the untreated endothelial monolayer produced an identical pattern of antibody-dependent adhesion (Fig. 1D) , with an even higher effect than when pretreating HUVEC (average 54.1% higher adhesion of treated U-937 vs. treated HUVEC). Thus, it would appear that shared critical regions of the CD13 molecule participate in each of its various functions and that CD13 ligation affects adhesion properties of monocytic cells and endothelial cells. Importantly, when primary PBMC were used in place of the U-937 cell line, we observed a similar dramatic increase in adhesion to HUVEC when the PBMC or HUVEC were pretreated with the mAb (Fig.  1E ). Similarly, primary macrophages and lung microvascular endothelial cells behave analogously (see Supplemental Fig. 5) . As monocytes and a small percentage of granulocytes are the only CD13 \u03e9 populations in PBMC, these results clearly demonstrate that ligation of endothelial or myeloid cell CD13 with specific antibodies induces adhesion of primary myeloid cells and monocytic cell lines. Thus, the U-937 cell line is a valid model for primary monocyte/endothelial interactions, as previously reported [34 -37] . We determined the kinetics of CD13-induced adhesion to endothelial monolayers (Supplemental Fig. 2 ).

If this were the case, CD13 must be expressed on both cell types for antibody-induced adhesion to occur. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3C , using the V5-tagged, CD13-transfected cells described above (hCD13-C33A), we found that anti-CD13, mAb-activated monocytic cells bind exclusively to CD13-expressing monolayers and not to nontransfected or vector-transfected controls, demonstrating that its expression is required to mediate adhesion. Additionally, mAb-treated monocytic cells did not bind to mAb-blocked hCD13-C33A monolayers, presumably by blocking CD13 homophilic interactions.

To investigate this question, U-937 cells were activated with a biotinylated form of anti-CD13 mAb 452, washed, and allowed to adhere to V5-tagged, CD13-transfected monolayers (hCD13-C33A). Monocytic CD13 was immunoprecipitated from total lysates of these cocultures using streptavidin beads, and the resulting complexes were probed for the presence of the monolayer-expressed V5 epitope (Fig. 4A) . V5-tagged proteins corresponding to the molecular weight of mature CD13 were readily apparent in lysates from conditions containing monolayers expressing full-length CD13 but not on nontransfected or vector-transfected control monolayers or cells expressing a V5-tagged tCD13 lacking the extracellular domains (htCD13), verifying the specificity of the precipitated band. Importantly, a nonspecific interaction with the V5 epitope is ruled out by the lack of V5-tagged tCD13 in complexes with immunoprecipitated monocytic cell CD13 (not shown). Similarly, excess antibody is not responsible for the coimmunoprecipitation, as V5-tagged proteins are not precipitated when the individual populations are first lysed and then mixed prior to immunoprecipitation, thus preventing endothelial/monocytic cell interaction (data not shown). Additionally, we observed a dosedependent abrogation of adhesion of mAb-activated monocytic cells to HUVEC when the monocytic cells were treated with a truncated recombinant sCD13 [20] , even when the protein was no longer present during the adhesion assay, and basal adhesion was unaffected, further supporting a direct CD13-CD13 interaction (Fig. 4B) . However, in the reciprocal experiment, treatment of mAb-activated HUVEC with sCD13 showed a significant but clearly less efficient inhibition of adhesion (Fig.  4C ), unless the protein was allowed to remain during the assay, signifying that it preferentially binds to mAb-treated, monocytic cells as compared with mAb-treated HUVEC. This suggests a more complex CD13-CD13 interaction that may involve the exposure of auxiliary molecules or ligands on monocytic cells after CD13 clustering and that the soluble form of the protein is capable of regulating this interaction. Alternatively, differential glycosylation of the CD13 molecule may play a role, as it has been proposed that at least five different glycoforms of CD13 exist [32, 41] .

However, antibody-induced adhesion requires signal transduction cascades in monocytic cells and endothelial cells, as preincubation of either cell type with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin prior to antibody treatment profoundly inhibited antibody-induced adhesion with no effect on basal adhesion at the concentrations used (Fig. 5A) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 671, "text": "(Fig. 5A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "CD13-induced monocytic cell-endothelial cell adhesion is signal transduction-dependent and involves actin polymerization"}, {"text": "In contrast, G protein-coupled receptor signaling is not involved, as pretreatment of the monocytic cells with pertussis toxin prior to antibody activation did not affect CD13-induced adhesion (data not shown). These results suggest that the adhesion induced by CD13 ligation requires signaling cascades in both cell types and that blocking these mechanisms in one cell population influences the induction of adhesion by CD13 ligation on the opposite cell. Interestingly, the signaling cascades triggered in monocytic cells consistently appear to predominate over those induced in HUVEC, as adhesion is always more potently affected when monocytic signal transduction mechanisms are inhibited, regardless of which cell type is treated with the mAb (Fig. 5A ). An important consequence of tyrosine kinase signal transduction is actin polymerization, which is absolutely required for monocyte adhesion to target cells [42, 43] . We have shown that during anti-CD13 mAb-induced monocytic adhesion, CD13 is clearly concentrated at the leading edge of monocytic cells that are migrating toward cellular aggregates and is actively redistributed to the zones of cell-cell contact in aggregated cells [17] . Similarly, CD13 redistributes to the phagocytic cups during Fc\u2425R-mediated phagocytosis [15] and is enriched at the leading edge and in the membrane projections of endothelial cells (Fig. 3A) , demonstrating that CD13 frequently accumulates at the sites of actin microfilament-driven processes. To determine whether microfilament assembly plays a role in CD13-induced adhesion, we inhibited this process with cytochalasin-D and assessed adhesion following anti-CD13 mAb treatment of endothelial cells (Fig. 5B ) or monocytic cells (Fig. 5C ). When endothelial cell CD13 is ligated, CD13-induced adhesion is essentially unaffected by blocking endothelial actin polymerization (Fig. 5B, Lanes 2 and 3 ). This is analogous to previous reports studying microvillar structures during leukocyte trafficking (similar to those in Fig. 3A ) in TNF-\u2423-activated endothelial cells [39, 44] . In contrast, pretreatment or persistent treatment of monocytic cells with cytochalasin-D completely abrogated adhesion to CD13-activated endothelial cells regardless of the status of endothelial cell actin polymerization (Fig. 5B, Lanes 4 and 5) , again implying that the downstream consequences of ligation of monocytic CD13 have a greater impact on adhesion than those in endothelial cells. Similarly, in the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 5C ), CD13-activated monocytic cells preincubated with cytochalasin-D showed a nearly 70% decrease in adhesion (Fig. 5C , Lane 3) and complete abrogation when the inhibitor was present during the entire assay (not shown) or when both cells are pretreated (Fig. 5C, Lane 5 ). In addition, cytochalasin treatment of HUVEC did not affect adhesion of mAb-treated monocytic cells (Fig. 5C, Lane 4) , clearly demonstrating that microfilament assembly is a principal consequence of CD13- induced signal transduction in monocytic cells. Accordingly, visualization of actin dynamics in CD13-activated monocytic cells with fluorescently labeled phalloidin showed that CD13 cross-linking induced the striking formation of numerous actinrich, filopodia-like protrusions after antibody activation when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5D ) at time periods consistent with kinetics of antibody-induced adhesion. Similar to this observation, treatment of monocytic cells with activating antibodies induces Ca fluxes (Supplemental Fig. 4 and refs. [16, 45] ).

Surprisingly, although both cohorts of control animals showed an intense leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneal wall that correlated with the number of peritoneal leukocytes, these numbers were clearly reduced in the anti-CD13 mAb-treated animals (Fig. 6, A-C) . Interestingly, at this early time-point (16 h), the relative representation of infiltrating granulocytes versus mononuclear cells in the peritoneal fluid did not appear to be affected by anti-CD13 mAb treatment, as determined by direct quantification of the relative number of harvested peritoneal cells (Fig. 6D) . Additionally, direct assessment of peripheral blood cell populations by FACS analysis of monocytes (CD11b\u03e9/Gr1-) and neutrophils (CD11b/Gr1 double-positive, Fig. 6E ) showed equivalent numbers in anti-CD13-treated animals when compared with controls, arguing against antibody-induced cell death as a mechanism for reduced peritoneal infiltration.

We show that the induction of adhesion is strictly dependent on the ability of antibodies to cluster CD13 and requires active tyrosine kinases and CD13 expression on monocytic cells and endothelial cells. Accordingly, the multivalent CD13L, HCoV-229E (which specifically binds and clusters CD13), also induced monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells.

However, our observation that sCD13 efficiently blocks the adhesion of anti-CD13treated monocytic cells but has only a modest effect on mAbtreated HUVEC suggests differential binding as a result of alternately glycosylated CD13 forms or an indirect heterophilic CD13-CD13 interaction, possibly via an \"adaptor/bridging\" molecule on the monocytic cell that is activated by CD13 cross-linking and enables it to bind to CD13 on the monolayers. The carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 has been shown to regulate monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration [51] and is also a CD13L ligand that participates in CD13-induced monocytic cell adhesion [18] . In preliminary studies, CD13-mediated monocytic cell/endothelial interactions are partially blocked by anti-galectin-3 antibodies, consistent with a contributory role for galectin-3 in CD13-induced adhesion (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that as other adhesion molecules, CD13 establishes homophilic and heterophilic (galectin-3-mediated) interactions, which would explain the incomplete block with sCD13 or anti-galectin-3 antibodies. A homophilic interaction could be the result of CD13 clustering, inducing an increase in avidity, as has been proposed for integrins, cadherins, and other cellular adhesion molecules [52] [53] [54] and thus, may also participate in CD13-induced adhesion on endothelial cells. Alternatively, clustering could result in a conformational change, exposing cryptic epitopes (as has been reported for anti-CD13 antibodies of the same specificity as our active mAb [32] ) that mediate adhesion. In this regard, under basal conditions, CD13 may exist in an \"inactive\" conformation, which clustering converts to an \"active\", oligomeric conformation now capable of interacting with inactive molecules on the untreated cells. CD13 ligation in both populations would produce only active forms incapable of establishing productive interactions and may explain the impaired inflammatory cell infiltration in vivo in the presence of antibodies (see below). The fact that sCD13 only blocks clustered CD13 suggests that it is in an inactive conformation (perhaps as a result of alternative glycosylation), which also explains its inability to induce adhesion.

Extending these observations, we show that these processes result in requisite actin polymerization, as demonstrated by complete abrogation of CD13induced adhesion by cytochalasin-D. Subsequently, CD13induced actin polymerization leads to the formation of filopodial structures, as seen with cross-linking of other membrane receptors and other activating stimuli [43, 55] .

Pertinent to our study, some viruses use filopodia to increase the efficiency of infection and possibly for receptor interaction [59, 60] .

Although we initially expected an increase in migration as a result of increased adhesion, our additional observations would also be consistent with de-creased transmigration in the presence of anti-CD13 mAb. As we have excluded cell death as a result of antibody-dependent mechanisms, the most straightforward explanation is that the continuous presence of circulating mAb blocks CD13 adhesion, presumably as a result of blocking binding sites or \"hyperactivating\" endothelial and monocytic CD13 to preclude binding, similar to our in vitro observations. Alternatively, although the effect of CD13 cross-linking on monocytic cell adhesion is apparent within 5 min of addition to the endothelial monolayer, our in vitro kinetic studies indicate that the adhesion diminishes to less than 50% of original values after 1 h of coculture, suggesting that the cells bind transiently and then detach, consistent with our observations in homotypic leukocyte adhesion [17] . It is possible that the signal induced by CD13 ligation is biphasic, first inducing adhesion via CD13-CD13 interactions and at later times, is antiadhesive, perhaps rendering cells refractory to subsequent adhesion via classical pathways. Another potential explanation is the CD13 ligationdependent induction of HA, which if it occurs in vivo, could prevent monocyte/endothelial interactions and transmigration. However, we see no evidence of cellular aggregates in our examination of tissues from treated versus untreated animals, nor are cells aggregated in the adhesion assays at any time of our time-points.
