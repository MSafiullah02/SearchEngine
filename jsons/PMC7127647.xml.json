Calves that fail to suckle adequately possess low concentrations of Ig in their serum. Therefore, intestinal absorption of a sufficient amount of Ig is a key factor in neonatal health and survival. Passive immunity provided by maternal Ig protects neonates from enteric disease, diarrhea, and respiratory disease for several weeks after birth [1]. If failure of passive transfer occurs, calves are predisposed to infection, sepsis, and death [2,3].",

Epithelial cells of the small intestine absorb colostral IgG1 via pinocytosis. Proteins pass through enterocytes in vacuoles and are released via exocytosis into lacteals [2,3]. From the lacteals, colostral proteins enter the systemic circulation, which allows newborn calves to receive maternal IgG1 by passive transfer [2,3]. Closure of the intestine to absorption is defined as cessation of absorption of macromolecules from gut to blood in neonates [9]. It is thought that the process of closure occurs in a retrograde manner, in that the basal cell membrane ceases to release the vacuolated proteins, transport ceases, and then uptake by the pinocytosis tubular system ceases [[10], [11], [12], [13]].",

Selenium has been postulated to act directly on intestinal epithelial cells to activate pinocytosis [17].

We previously reported that feeding Se-biofortified hay to these pregnant beef cows improved Se status in cows and their offspring, as well as the IgG1 concentrations in colostrum compared to cows receiving control hay [20]. In this paper, to test the hypothesis that passive transfer is enhanced in calves born to cows fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay in the last trimester of pregnancy compared to calves born to Control cows fed the USDA-approved upper limit of Na-selenite in salt [21], we administered 25 g oral ovalbumin (OVA) to calves at 12, 24, or 36 h after birth, and measured serum OVA concentrations to estimate the time of gut closure. We chose OVA with 44,300 Da molecular weight (MW) as a surrogate protein for IgG (the bovine IgG molecule is approximately 150,000 Da MW) because human albumin with 68,000 Da MW and human IgG with 163,000 Da MW have been previously shown to be absorbed equally in relation to total dose in calves [10]. If passive transfer was prolonged by enhanced Se intake in dams, we expected OVA concentrations in serum of newborn calves to be higher at all dosing time points compared to Control calves.",

The plates were then incubated for 30 min with 100 \u03bcl T-TBS, and then washed again 3 times with T-TBS. For the standard, albumin from chicken egg white (Sigma) was diluted in T-TBS from 50 ng to 0.1 ng. Calf serum samples from all time points were diluted in T-TBS at 1:50, 1:200, and 1:800. The standards and samples were plated in duplicate at 100 \u03bcL per well, and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, plates were washed 3 times in T-TBS. Anti-ovalbumin antibody complexed with horseradish peroxidase [rabbit anti-Ovalbumin (OVA) antibody (HRP); 1 mg/mL; antibodies-online Inc., Atlanta, GA) was added at 1 \u03bcg in 100 \u03bcL/well and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature.

The experimental design was a dose-response trial with control and two treatment levels of Se-biofortified alfalfa hay fed to cows. For outcome variables (except for colostrum), repeated measures over time were collected in calves. For OVA measurements, we additionally accounted for time of OVA administration. We tested for homogeneity of variance among treatments and for normal distribution of residuals. The effects of agronomic Se fortification on colostral Se and IgG1 concentrations were measured using PROC GLM. Fixed effects in the models were Se application rate (Control, Med-Se, High-Se), calf gender, and age group of cow (2\u20133 years, > 3 years). For repeated measures within animals (calf WB-Se concentrations, serum IgG1 concentrations, serum OVA concentrations), we modeled repeated measurements within animals using an unstructured variance-covariance structure. The unstructured variance-covariance matrix provided the most parsimonious matrix based on the lowest value by the Aikaike Information Criterion. Fixed effects in the models were Se application rate (Control, Med-Se, High-Se), blood sampling time, and the interaction of blood sampling time and Se application rate.

The mechanism by which High-Se supplementation increases colostral IgG1 concentration is unknown, and multiple factors may be involved. It is possible that increased concentrations of selenoproteins acting on mammary gland epithelium alter the number of specific nutrient transporters or growth and vascularization of mammary tissues as is hypothesized for intestinal tissues [25]. Because timing of colostrum formation also has an effect on IgG1 concentrations, High-Se supplementation may also increase the duration of colostrum synthesis attributable to endocrine regulation or genetic variation of the transporter(s) [5].",

We previously hypothesized that calves reached the physiologic limitation for mass of Ig that can be passively transferred from a given volume of colostrum [26]. In Besser et al. [26], calves consumed more than 2 L of colostrum, a threshold volume that Stott et al. [27] proposed as necessary to maximize pinocytosis of all available fetal enterocytes. This suggests that reaching thresholds for mass of IgG1 consumed or volume of colostrum consumed are the primary factors in achieving effective passive transfer in Se-replete calves [27]. Our new results, using OVA as a model for passive transfer, suggest that if calves do not receive adequate colostrum to reach maximal pinocytosis, then High-Se treatment of dams may improve passive transfer if calves receive colostrum within the first 12 h of age.",

Calves fed 2 L did not have a further increase in passive transfer if a second feeding was administered 12 h later. Stott et al. [27] showed that peak serum IgG concentrations occurred during the first 16 h after the time of initial colostrum ingestion. Immunoglobulin G1, albumin, and the neonatal form of the Ig receptor, FcRn, may be secreted into colostrum as a large complex [28]. Despite its name, this receptor does not play a role in absorption of IgG1 in the neonate. The main role of this receptor is to recycle IgG1 back into the intestinal lumen [28], thus prolonging the availability of IgG1 for absorption by pinocytosis.",

Consequently, calculated Se intake from dietary sources was 8.3 mg Se/head (including 3 mg Se/head daily from Na-selenite) for Control cows. This is reflected by the increase in whole blood Se concentrations in Control cows from151 \u00b1 4 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SEM) at baseline to 193 \u00b1 14 ng/mL at parturition [20].

It is possible that neonatal small intestinal development can be affected by maternal Se nutrition in cattle during the third trimester of gestation, thereby altering passive transfer capacity in newborn calves. Enhancing the Se status of the neonatal calf can be achieved by feeding the dam Se-biofortified alfalfa hay during the last 8 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, feeding Se-fortified alfalfa hay to the pregnant beef cow increases IgG1 concentrations in colostrum. Based on these results from OVA administration, we suggest that early feeding (\u2264 12 h of age) will also increase IgG1 concentrations in calves from High-Se dams receiving similar volumes/concentrations of IgG1 colostrum compared to Control calves.",
