The main tool uses AI technology to recognize intrinsic disorder, given the protein sequence. The model involves the listing of shell disorder by coronaviruses that is easily clustered into three groups, which incidentally correlate with the known levels of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission of the various coronaviruses. The model predicts that the 2003 SARS-CoV (M PID = 8% and N PID = 50%) is included into a category of CoVs with intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials.",

Upon the availability of the sequences of both MERS-CoV M and N proteins, the authors were able to confirm that MERS-CoV falls solidly into a category of viruses that have lesser respiratory transmission potential but have greater fecal-oral transmission capabilitie [6,7]. The categorization of MERS-CoV within this category was supported by the observations that MERS-CoV is not efficiently spreading among humans, unlike SARS-CoV, and requires close contact [8]. Furthermore, it is now known that camels are the natural reservoir for MERS-CoV, and viruses that are associated with farm animals, such as camels, tend to have greater fecal-oral transmission potentials [9].",

The M protein of CoV was chosen over the E protein because the M protein is a major transmembrane protein that is found in large numbers in the virion, whereas E protein is a minor protein of the envelope. Also, in previous studies, membrane or matrix proteins of various viruses were analysed with respect to their intrinsic disorder content and roles in protecting the respective virions. The N protein is also important for our model, as it has been shown that greater disorder in the inner shell is associated with the mode of infection and virulence in other viruses [[23], [24], [25], [26]].",

We represented the outputs of these analyses in the form of the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered divided by the total number of residues in a query protein. Statistical analyses using regression analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were done using R statistical package [34]. Regression analyses were done using category as the dependent variable with M and N PIDs as independent variables or N PID as a sole independent variable. Categories were assigned the values of 1, 2 and 3 to the three groups as according to the level of respiratory transmission potential.

This model was based on the analysis of mainly the PIDs found for N proteins, the viruses were clustered into three groups according to their transmission mode, while the M PIDs provide an indicator of resilience of the virus in the harsh environment. The three groups are represented in Table 1\n. A Two-Way ANOVA (p < 0.001) indicates that the groups are statistically identifiable. The Table shows that category A consists of viruses that have greater respiratory transmission capabilities but lower fecal-oral transmission potentials. Category B involves coronaviruses that have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials, whereas category C comprises of viruses with lower respiratory transmission. Furthermore, a higher inner shell disorder is often associated with the greater infectivity, especially with regard to respiratory transmission potential since disorder allows greater promiscuity of binding [6,7].",

We believe that this is not the case. If SARS-CoV-2 would be placed in category C, the same category as MERS-CoV, then the model would be definitely wrong in terms of reproducibility. On the other hand, the placing of SARS-COV-2 in category A would be an inconsistency that would be difficult to explain. One would further notice that very few CoVs fall into category A, with the exception for HCoV-229E and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which make the chance of any CoVs including SARS-COV-2, to be in category A slim. More importantly, because SARS-CoV-2 is zoonotic and the only non-human CoV in category A is the avian IBV, placing SARS-COV-2 in category A could suggest that this virus is likely to be of avian origin, which is inconsistent with what we know about SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic study has confirmed that the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are bat CoVs [4,36]. We also noticed that at least three of closest neighbors with similar N PIDs of 47\u201348% are those of bat origin (See Table 1). This suggests that bat CoVs are likely to have an optimal mix of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission potentials that reflect their N PID range of 47\u201348%, which provides for greater fitness for the spread of the viruses among bats and that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be of bat origin too given its N PID is 48%. There are highly debatable suggestions that snakes or pangolins [3,37,38] may be an intermediary host of the virus. Even if any of these is later deemed as true, our data imply that the virus had not the chance to evolved much with any intermediary host except bats, unlike the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the model does suggest that they had evolved with hosts such as civet cats and camels respectively. This suggestion is, however, based on N PID alone.",

At that time even after 2003 SARS-CoV, the wealth of CoV knowledge lies in the field of veterinary medicine [5,6]. Using what was then known about behaviors of porcine CoVs, a successful attempt to correlate M and N PIDs to modes of transmission was made [5,6]. The results were similar to those found in Table 1 and Fig. 1 without the data pertaining to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, of course, since the MERS-CoV and COVID-19 outbreaks had yet to occur then.",

Furthermore, a strong but oddly weaker correlation (r2 = 0.77, p < 0.001) can also be found when N PID is the sole independent variable even if poor correlation (r2 = 0.21) is found when M PID is the sole independent variable. This basically means that the model should include both M and N PIDs as the statistical model seems to suggest that M PID does contribute, even if slightly, to the mode of transmission in conjunction to the major contribution by N PID. .This is consistent with the idea that both M and N play roles in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on mode of transmission. A qualitative inspection of the viruses in the three groups also reveals consistency. For example, as in Table 1, canine CoV-respiratory falls into category B, while canine CoV-enteritis is in category C. The porcine CoVs are also consistent with observation of their behaviors as we will later see.",

In the case of Nipah virus, the virulence and inner shell disorder were linked to the modes of transmission [26].",

This ability provides for rapid replication of the viral proteins and particles. This quick replication is also an efficient way to evade the host immune system by reproducing a large number of viral particles before the immune system even recognizes the virus, which then often goes on to overwhelm the body leading to the death of the host [6,[23], [24], [25], [26]]. One highly plausible explanation for the link between rapid replication and the modes of transmission is that viral load in the body fluids of the infected host needs to be sufficiently high before the virus can be infectious via the respiratory mode. This therefore explains the fact that rapid viral replication and inner shell disorder were found to be the common link between virulence and respiratory transmission in the case of Nipah virus [26].",

The N protein also helps with the packaging and budding of viral particles in the host ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum) [23,30,40].

            "text": "Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have intermediate respiratory transmission potentials, how do we account for the greater contagiousness of the latter? We need to understand that the respiratory transmission potential of a single viral particle is just one of several factors that might contribute to the contagiousness of the virus. Other factors include how many particles are released by the host and how long does the particle remain in the environment. We mentioned that our model has detected something odd about SARS-COV-2: this virus has one of the hardest outer shell within the family as seen in Fig. 1 and Table 1 (M PID = 6%). Since the outer shell plays the greater role in protecting the virion in comparison to the inner shell, the harder outer shell provides virus greater resilience to outside the body environment and to the presence of digestive enzymes found in the saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids [20,22,[42], [43], [44], [45], [46]]. As a result, the virus with the harder outer shell is able to remain active for a longer time and, therefore a lesser number of viral particles is required for a chance to infect someone. Furthermore, because the virus is more resistant to the digestive enzymes in the bodily fluids, an infected body is likely to discharged more infectious particles.",

This is, however, not true in the field of veterinary medicine, where coronaviruses have posed a menace to livestock. This is especially so in the case of TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus). TGEV could move rapidly among farm pigs to quickly devastate the farming community if not controlled early [[5], [6], [7]]. Our analysis reveals that TGEV is of category C (higher fecal-oral, lower respiratory transmission potentials) with M and N PIDs at 14% and 43% respectively. The reason that it is able to move rapidly is that its high fecal-oral transmission potential represents a more efficient mode of transmission among the farm animals.",

While TGEV is highly infectious, PEDV is less contagious among farm pigs. A peculiar characteristic has been observed by farmers and veterinarians: PEDV can reappear out of nowhere from within the same pen that was previously occupied by infected pigs, even after the disease has passed on several months ago. An inspection of the M and N PIDs reveals the reason showing that PEDV belongs to the category B, along with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, unlike TGEV and MERS-CoV. This means that PEDV has a higher respiratory transmission potential than TGEV and that implies greater chances of fecal-respiratory transmission for the former. Obviously, viral particles in fecal materials that was somehow inadvertently left behind go on to infect a new population of pigs several months later [[5], [6], [7]].",

Apparently, the result is implying that this is not necessarily true, as we have seen, and having higher fecal-oral transmission potential can actually provide greater efficiency in the spread among farm animals, as we have seen in TGEV, such that the virus does not have to stay long outside the body. The ability to stay longer in the environment could, however, provide advantages to a virus with greater respiratory transmission potential, especially with respect to spread via airborne virus from feces or body fluids.

This peculiarity is likely responsible for its high level of contagiousness, since hardness of its outer shell could provide the virus with the greater resilience to the conditions outside the body and in body fluid, as the harder shell will better protect the virion from damage as a result of the hostile environment and action of the digestive enzymes found in bodily fluids. As a result, it is likely that the infected body can shed more infectious particles that have a greater chance of infecting a person over its lifetime. Chances of infections via indirect contact and airborne virus from feces and bodily fluids are therefore greater.
