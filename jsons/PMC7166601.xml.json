            "text": "Meloxicam is a Food and Drug Administration approved product for daily oral and parenteral administration in dogs (Metacam\u00ae Boehringer Ingelheim; Loxicom\u00ae Norbrook). It is a nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a higher selectivity in several species for cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) inhibitory activity than for cyclooxygenase\u20101 (COX\u20101). This analgesic is commonly selected for research mice in compliance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal 8th Edition (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011) and the current industry standard of practice of providing analgesia for procedures expected to cause more than momentary pain or distress. Based on the search of publically accessible university formularies for this analgesic, it is apparent that there is a wide dosage range in mice (0.3\u201320 mg/kg every 12\u201324 h), with a commonly used dosage of 1\u20132 mg/kg every 24 h (Animal Care and Use Program UCSF, 2015; Boston University, 2015; Johns Hopkins University, 2015; Portland VA, 2015; University of British Columbia, 2015; University of Pennsylvania, 2015). Recommended dosages in mice have been based on postprocedural physiologic and behavioral parameters, but to date, there is limited information correlating dose to plasma concentrations (Tubbs et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012; Ratsep et al., 2013; Kendall et al., 2014).",

Meloxicam is a common drug of choice and is often administered at 24\u2010h intervals. The purpose of this study was to characterize the plasma concentrations of meloxicam given at 24\u2010h intervals for 72 h in male and female C57BL/6 mice and compare, over time, these values to reference COX\u20102 inhibition constants for meloxicam. Data from male and female mice were also compared because gender differences in meloxicam pharmacokinetics from subcutaneous administration are currently unknown. Sex\u2010based considerations are important to address as stated in the 2014 National Institute of Health's policy for preclinical research (Clayton & Collins, 2014). The C57BL/6 mice were chosen as this strain represents the most commonly used in disease models.",

            "text": "Meloxicam is an established analgesic agent for mice used in laboratory research. Despite the common use of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of meloxicam in mice, s.c. pharmacokinetics information is currently limited (Kendall et al., 2014). The reported s.c. doses have been found to have a roughly 10\u2010fold variation, with a range of approximately 2\u201320 mg/kg being employed depending on the institution and surgical procedure (Leach et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012). Dosing intervals as long as 24 h have been used for s.c. treatment of mice, although this species has demonstrated rapid plasma clearance from other dosing routes. The previously reported intravenous and oral plasma clearances of meloxicam in mice are approximately 10\u2010fold higher than those found for rats and humans (Busch et al., 1998). While rats and humans have half\u2010lives that allow once\u2010daily dosing, the clearance displayed by mice may require more frequent dosing to maintain analgesia. By characterizing the pharmacokinetics of a regimen of q24 h s.c., dosing of meloxicam for 3 days in mice, it is our intent to provide information that will enable investigators to achieve effective s.c. drug exposures. To this end, the pharmacokinetics were used to simulate meloxicam s.c. dosage regimens that provide coverage of the primary pharmacological target, cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102), as suggested by published mouse efficacy studies.",

This suggests good s.c. absorption as the published oral bioavailability is 94% (Busch et al., 1998).",

This agrees with previous studies where mice were shown to have the highest reported i.v. and p.o. clearance when compared to rats, dogs, mini\u2010pigs, baboons, and rabbits (Busch et al., 1998; Carpenter et al., 2009). Meloxicam is actually a low\u2010extraction drug in all species, including mice, as defined by the calculated extraction ratio (ER) of 0.029 based on the i.v. CL and a hepatic blood flow of 90 mL/min/kg (Davies & Morris, 1993). However, the mouse CL is 10\u2010fold higher than the CL in rats, dogs, and humans. At least one explanation for higher clearance, other than the high metabolic rate of mice, is the lower degree of plasma nonspecific binding. (Busch et al., 1998).",

This information implies that a gender\u2010based dose adjustment would not be required if the trough concentration is used as the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodyamic index. Rats demonstrated a similar gender trend from oral dosing where male rats showed a lower plasma concentration, but unlike the mice, meloxicam in male rats had a shorter half\u2010life when compared to that in female rats (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products EMEA, 1997).",

PK and pathology were defined, a review of meloxicam pharmacology was initiated to determine if there is agreement between known efficacious doses, in vivo drug exposures, and coverage of COX\u20102. The challenge of performing such an assessment is that the in vivo translation of in vitro and ex vivo COX inhibition lacks standardization, and differences in assay methodology have led to interlaboratory variation in the determination of inhibition constants (Vane & Botting, 1995; Brooks et al., 1999; Blain et al., 2002). For this reason, whole blood assay approaches have been favored as they appear to be superior to cellular assays in predicting efficacy of drug exposures. For example, the efficacious doses of several COX inhibitors produce total in vivo plasma concentrations that are greater than the whole blood COX\u20102 IC\n80 (Warner et al., 1999). Because the COX\u20102 enzyme sequence identity is 90% conserved across species (Guan et al., 1997), human whole blood inhibition constants were used in the comparison of mouse dosage regimens and mouse efficacy studies (Table 4).",

In one study, an ID\n50 oral meloxicam dose of 1.36 mg/kg/day (two doses, q8 h) was determined against zymosan that was used to induce inflammatory markers in the peritoneum (Engelhardt, 1996). Single\u2010dose ED\n50 values for intraperitoneal (IP) meloxicam in mice have also been reported for writhing induced by acetic acid (2.6\u20136.5 mg/kg) (Santos et al., 1998; Miranda et al., 2006). If only modest differences (\u22642\u2010fold) in plasma concentrations related to dosing route and formulation are assumed, s.c. meloxicam in these dose ranges is expected to inhibit COX\u20102 as the whole blood IC\n50 (230\u2013250 nm) would be achieved for approximately 12 h at only 1.6 mg/kg s.c. (Fig 2A). While we acknowledge some important assumptions in this retrospective analysis, it is proposed that known effective meloxicam doses for mice are reflective of a correlation between our observed plasma drug exposures and published whole blood inhibition constants.",

It should be noted that these projections may only apply to the formulation studied here. The alternative of giving a higher dose once a day would lead to high C\nmax values that may be tolerated for acute treatment, but may also contribute to increased risk of adverse events. Simulation of the top reported s.c. dose of 20 mg/kg suggests the time above the whole blood IC\n50 would be extended to ~18 h assuming that the absorption rate remains unchanged at such a high dose (Leach et al., 2012). Subcutaneous doses of 3 and 20 mg/kg delivered q12 h are estimated to cover the IC\n50 (12 h/dose) and IC\n80 (11 h/dose), respectively (Fig. 2B). Alternatively, the development of new formulations that modestly delay absorption without affecting the onset of action could allow for daily dosing. PK simulation suggested delaying T\nmax to just 4.5 h could provide coverage of COX\u20102 IC\n50 for 24 h/dose and IC\n80 for 23 h/dose when using s.c. doses of 3 and 20 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 2C).",

Admittedly, our conclusions weigh heavily on the use of human whole blood COX\u20102 inhibition, although COX\u20102 is a highly conserved enzyme across species. As a wide range of s.c. meloxicam doses are currently used in practice, we propose researchers consider modifying their preferred meloxicam dosing to q12 h if the increase in animal handling is tolerated. It is anticipated that any s.c. inflammatory response from a short\u2010term increased dosing frequency would be minimal as no pathologic lesions were noted in the skin with daily s.c. administration over a 3\u2010day period. While an efficacy endpoint was not included in our studies, these findings have highlighted a potential deficiency in the way meloxicam analgesia is provided to mice.
