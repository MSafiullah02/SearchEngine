            "text": "Some of the main points concerning mental health include:Loneliness can make you ill by increasing stress, which can severely impact physical and mental health. While epidemiological models are good at measuring tangibles such as infection and mortality rates, they are less able to measure social costs such as loneliness. The consequences are no less real for those suffering.Parents\u2019 own mental health is important for children\u2019s development since caregivers are children\u2019s primary emotion regulators in times of stress. Parents need to look after their own mental health, for the sake of their children as well as themselves.Symptoms of anxiety and depression correlate with level of media exposure. Since this pandemic saturates us with information 24 hours a day, it is recommended that adults choose only one or two times a day to watch or read news updates. Parents also need to be aware of the information passed on to children, both factual and emotional, because children will learn from whatever information is around them.Changing behaviour is hard, particularly when the consequences seem quite abstract (e.g., don\u2019t scratch your nose because that\u2019ll protect your grandpa). Gaining knowledge about how things work can help. For younger children, rule-based information such as \u201cwash your hands\u201d is much less effective without explaining why and how it works (reducing illness transmission, staying healthy).Similarly, for those who have become stand-in-teachers overnight, the science of learning can provide some general pointers:Remember that learning can be slow and difficult; maintaining motivation and minimising frustration is key.Make learning meaningful to the child: what do they want to learn about? For younger children, follow their lead. For older children, who are following stricter learning roadmaps, try to relate topics in subjects they don\u2019t like to topics in subjects they do, e.g., relate testing for chlorine gas in Chemistry to a History lesson on the use of chlorine as a weapon in the First World War.Promote autonomy by giving children choice and flexibility. Try encouraging them to create their own timetables, including breaks and snack times.Give frequent, positive verbal feedback; it acts as a powerful reward which can promote better learning.Most important of all, physical exercise, a good diet, and sufficient sleep are the cornerstones of any effective learning.",

            "text": "On the downside, the requirement for children to continue their studies at home may exacerbate differences in educational progress caused by inequalities. Children from homes with fewer resources and less opportunity for parental support risk falling behind, widening pre-existing gaps. Worse still, some children may feel unsafe in their homes. Children of well-off parents often live in bigger houses, have their own bedrooms, support from two parents rather than one, and better access to technology, books, and other learning resources, not to mention basics such as food. At least in school, pupils share the same spaces, lessons, teachers, and resources, which levels opportunities to some extent. Moreover, studying at home will affect some age groups more than others. Teenagers, whose emotional development propels them to move away from parents and carers and towards friends and peers, are likely to be more adversely affected.",

Might the pandemic cause educators to think harder about the current models of educational provision, learning faster about which uses of technology are successful and which are not? Granted, the initial versions of education at home often look quite like the traditional teacher-led classroom, with teachers setting work to be completed at home, supplemented by some websites or online tutoring for narrow skills such as spelling or arithmetic. But perhaps there are also initial glimpses of what a technology-led revolution in education might look like: teachers serving as curators for virtual learning environments, which children can explore together with classmates to solve problems. In these environments, children can self-regulate their learning, switching to video tutorials or guidance from teachers when they need to learn new skills to proceed. Think Minecraft, Roblox, and YouTube.",

Perhaps more importantly, returning to our opening theme of the role of policymakers, policy is not the only driver of these innovations. Instead, progress is driven by the cultural and commercial technology ecosystem. This crisis has made it apparent that school-provided IT systems for computer-based learning are becoming redundant. They are too expensive, too cumbersome, and too quickly out of date. Perhaps we need instead to move to personal devices integrated into schools. Just as we turn on Airplane Mode when we get on a plane, perhaps we will turn on Education Mode when we enter school.",

            "text": "This suggests the policy solutions needed to reshape education through technology are not prescriptive, but regulatory. Policy needs to incentivise commercial developers to move into education. The role of policymakers, by contrast, should be to understand and mitigate the possible risks of technology use in children, as documented by research. As a starting point, these risks include screen time addiction and intolerance of boredom, displacement of other activities (e.g., homework, play), social media bullying, unreliable information, sleep disruption, violent or otherwise age-inappropriate content, and data protection issues.",

Deliberate attempts to create games that deliver learning\u2014 to gamify education\u2014 have so far been relatively poor because their focus has been on content and not game mechanics. Such mechanics, triggering engagement and curiosity in children, are understood much better by well-resourced commercial game developers. This is where government incentivisation may be effective, to encourage commercial developers to produce engaging and powerful educational games and learning environments.",
