For example, soybean dwarf (SBDV) and subterranean clover red leaf (SCRLV) viruses are so closely related serologically that they may be strains of the same virus.

The products of ORFs 0, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are unnecessary for RNA replication in protoplasts, but some of them can increase the accumulation of viral RNA. The product of ORF 2 is expressed only as a C-terminal fusion with ORF 1 (P1\u20132). ORF 2 encodes the RDRP component of the replicase. P1 of poleroviruses contains the catalytic triad of amino acids conserved among cysteine proteases. Downstream of this region, but upstream of the frameshift site, P1 also contains the VPg amino acid sequence. Thus, the VPg is made available presumably by proteolytic cleavage of P1 and/or P1\u20132. P3 is the major coat protein (CP). A minor portion of the coat proteins produced in infection consists of a fusion of P3 and P5 made by translational readthrough of the ORF 3 stop codon. P4 is necessary for systemic infection of plants by BYDV, but not by BWYV. Evidence supports a role in cell-to-cell movement for P4 of PLRV: it is associated with plasmodesmata and fragments of this phosphorylatable protein have noncovalent, nonspecific single-stranded nucleic acid binding properties. The P3\u20135 translational readthrough product is often found cleaved about midway in the P5 domain. The N-terminal portion of P5 is necessary and sufficient (when fused to coat protein on virions) for aphid transmission. The C-terminal portion of P5 may be involved in virus movement within the plant, at least for BWYV.",

A sequence located, surprisingly, in the 3\u2032 end of the genome facilitates efficient cap-independent translation. The polymerase gene (ORF 2) is expressed only via a \u2018\u22121\u2019 ribosomal frameshift that occurs during translation of ORF 1 in the region where the two ORFs overlap. At a low frequency, elongating ribosomes slip back one nucleotide, moving from ORF 1 to ORF 2, resulting in a low abundance fusion protein comprising these two ORFs. Ribosomal frameshifting facilitates synthesis of low levels of polymerase, an enzyme needed in only small quantities, and high levels of its N-terminal region, P1, whose function by itself is unknown. Some of the cis-acting signals that mediate this event \u2013 a shifty heptanucleotide followed by a highly structured sequence \u2013 are similar to those which induce \u22121 frameshifting in translation of the polymerases of corona viruses and retroviruses.

Both of the associated RNAs enhance accumulation of their helper viruses. This typifies a phenomenon in Luteoviridae in which RNAs harboring luteovirus-like and polerovirus-like RDRP genes, enhance each others' accumulation. These cross-enhancing interactions range from mixed infections of BYDV and CYDV viruses, to complete interdependence of two such RNAs in pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV).

            "text": "The mechanism of virus transmission and vector specificity has been examined ultrastructurally by Gildow. He showed that the virus is specifically transported across three barriers: the hindgut epithelium, and the basal lamina and plasmalemma of the accessory salivary gland. Particles are then released into the phloem via the salivary duct as the aphid feeds. The particles appear to cross both the hindgut epithelium and the accessory salivary gland plasmalemma via receptor-mediated endocytosis in coated vesicles. Luteoviridae, but not other plant viruses, can cross the hindgut into the hemocele even in nonvector aphid species. However, only those virions that can be transmitted by the aphid can cross the plasmalemma of the accessory salivary gland. A highly abundant protein, called symbionin, that is produced by endosymbiotic bacteria (Buchnera spp.) in the hemocele, binds the readthrough domain of the virus particle. This protein resembles the chaperonin groEL, and may be involved in maintaining particle stability in the hemolymph.",

The exception is PEMV which can infect mesophyll cells and spread systemically, allowing it to be transmitted mechanically. The blockage of sieve tubes and degeneration of vascular tissue may account for the disease symptoms, although severity of disease symptoms does not always correlate with the amount of virus accumulating in the plant. Under laboratory conditions, protoplasts derived from mesophyll, epidermis, xylem and undifferentiated tissue can be infected with Luteoviridae. Thus, Luteoviridae do not require conditions found only in phloem cells, but rather their limitation to the phloem may be a result of their lack of ability to move from cell-to-cell into other tissues. Some evidence indicates that in whole plants, PLRV can be found in low levels in mesophyll cells.",

In general, Luteoviridae cause stunting of plants, yellowing, reddening or \u2018rolling\u2019 of leaves, and an increase in leaf brittleness. Because symptoms may be confined to stunting or a change in leaf color that is not an obvious mosaic or mottle, luteovirus infection can be confused with nutritional deficiencies or other environmental stresses. Environmental factors also affect symptoms. Cool temperatures and high light maximize changes in leaf color.\nThe most common symptom caused by BYDV or CYDV is stunting. As their names imply, they cause yellowing in many lines of barley. They can induce bright reddening of leaf tips in oats, corn and other grasses. This can be confused with the effects of frost. In oats, BYDV causes a marked increase in sterile florets. This, combined with reduced kernel weight caused by BYDV in oats and barley, greatly reduces grain yield. Symptoms can vary between hosts. A BYDV isolate called PAV129 is virtually symptomless in wheat from which it was isolated initially, but it is very severe in oats, including cultivars that are resistant to other isolates. BWYV induces bright yellowing of leaves on sugar beets, lettuce and spinach. In addition to leaf curling, PLRV causes net necrosis, a blackening of the vascular tissue in the tuber. Unlike most plant viruses, TNDV can kill its host in natural infections, as can BYDV under laboratory conditions.",

These include: (1) avoidance of aphids through careful monitoring of aphid populations and timing of planting; (2) use of insecticides or parasites to reduce aphid populations; and (3) use of crops that are genetically resistant to Luteoviridae.\nFor control of BMYV in England, an equation involving the abundance of vector Myzus persicae in the autumn and the number of frost days in the winter is used to predict the arrival of aphids the following spring. If the predicted infestation is high, seeds pretreated with insecticide are recommended. An additional spray warning system is used after aphids have begun to colonize plants. If aphids exceed a threshold, growers are advised to spray insecticides. For BYDV hosts, sowing fall and spring cereals after major aphid migrations will reduce the chances of aphid colonization. However, this strategy reduces the time available for the crop to reach maturity and thus may reduce yield. The use of insecticides to control Luteoviridae is cost-effective only in areas of extremely intensive agriculture, such as wheat fields in England and potato fields in the northwestern USA.\nParasitic wasps have proved to be effective biological control agents, reducing BYDV spread in South America, but their ability to control aphids is often limited.",

If BYDV caused 5% losses in 1989, it would have been valued at $US387 million for wheat, $US48 million for barley and $US28 million for oats. BYDV usually causes more obvious damage to oats and barley than to wheat. But due to the extensiveness of wheat production, the reduction in yield caused by BYDV, however slight, probably adds up to a significant monetary loss.

Beginning in 1968, the use of more resistant varieties of sugar beets and phytosanitary cropping practices greatly reduced the incidence of BWYV infection. The ensuing increase in yield, credited largely to the reduction in BWYV incidence, was estimated at $US167 million for a 5 year period in the state of California alone. Artificial inoculation of oilseed rape with BWYV resulted in 25% yield loss.
