Blood samples were collected on the enrollment day, from 2 to 8 days after the onset of illness. PPAbs were derived from samples [16] and tested by ELISA for binding reactivity to A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure 1A and 1B). For control, we used a pool of PPAbs derived from blood samples collected on days 6\u20138 after vaccination from a group of recipients of the 2011 IIV, which contained A(H1N1)pdm09. A(H1N1)pdm09-specific binding was detected in the PPAb pool from the IIV recipients and from individual PPAb samples from 6 of the 7 A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients who presented at day 4 or later after symptom onset (Figure 1B). Binding was not detected in the PPAb samples collected from A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients on days 2 or 3 or from patients infected with influenza B virus, metapneumovirus, or coronavirus. In A(H1N1)pdm09-reactive PPAb samples from A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients, the binding activity of IgG was significantly higher than that of IgA (P = .01, by the paired t test). These results suggest that, in patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, substantial virus-specific plasmablast responses are detectable in the blood 4 days after symptom onset and that the IgG response is dominant.",

Since the precise kinetics of the peripheral plasmablast response in influenza virus infection are not known, the observed reactivity of PPAb samples collected on different days after disease onset might not represent the peak plasmablast response. Therefore, instead of comparing the reactivity to each influenza virus protein directly, we normalized the NP and M1 binding activity to HA reactivity, since HA is the primary antigenic target of IIV. These normalized reactivities provide information about the relative pattern of PPAb responses to different influenza virus proteins. As shown in Figure 2B, the normalized NP reactivity was significantly higher in the A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients than in the IIV recipients. The mean of normalized binding activity for M1 was also higher in the infected patients than in the IIV recipients, but the difference was not statistically significant, perhaps because of the small sample size and large variability among the infected patients. Taken together, these results indicate that, in addition to a B-cell response to the variable HA, patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 developed B-cell responses to the conserved NP that were significantly higher than those mounted by IIV recipients despite the fact that IIV preparations contain large amounts of NP [21, 22].",

Each A(H1N1)pdm09-infected PPAb sample with detectable pH1 binding also bound to sH1 and H5 (Figure 3A). In addition, these PPAbs bound to the HA2 portion of H5, which contains the conserved major antigenic site of the stalk domain. In agreement with our previous reports [17, 23], the IIV PPAb pool also bound the heterovariant sH1. These results indicate that a cross-reactive PPAb response to heterovariant and heterosubtypic HAs was induced in patients with acute A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and that cross-reactivity was in part mediated by the binding to the conserved HA stalk domain.",

In a recent human challenge study with wild-type influenza virus, virus-specific plasmablasts were detected at day 7 after infection [30]. This study did not, however, examine the kinetics of the infection-induced plasmablast response or the antibody specificities of these plasmablasts. The kinetics of the B-cell response in naturally infected patients is likely to be more variable than the kinetics in volunteers who receive standardized vaccines or who are experimentally challenged with wild-type influenza virus preparations at a prespecified time and dose. This supposition is supported by the report that plasmablast-derived influenza virus\u2013specific monoclonal antibodies were isolated from influenza virus\u2013infected patients 9\u201331 days after the onset of symptoms [13]. In our current study, we detected substantial PPAb responses in infected patients for several days after the onset of symptoms, although multiple sampling was not performed to identify the peak day. Other limitations of the current study are the lack of randomization in the comparisons of infected versus vaccinated individuals and the seronegative versus seropositive individuals, and the small number and wide age range and underlying diseases of the infected patients examined. The only elderly patient (patient 1) had substantial PPAb reactivity to NP but not HA; this differed from the response of all the younger patients. We previously reported a weaker plasmablast response in elderly subjects than in younger individuals after immunization with IIV, and HA is the primary antigenic component in this vaccine [31]. It is not clear whether the lack of a detectable HA-specific PPAb reactivity in this elderly patient was due to off-peak sample collection or to a generally reduced HA-specific response. Thus, we suggest that the kinetics of the plasmablast response, including its quantitative and qualitative characteristics over the disease course, should be addressed in future studies of defined subject populations experimentally challenged with wild-type virus.",

Recently, we reported that LAIV also induces proportionally greater plasmablast responses to NP and variant HA proteins than IIV [17]. Our findings suggest that LAIV immunization recapitulates some distinct qualitative characteristics of wild-type influenza virus infection in terms of B-cell response, but at a much lower magnitude. Thus, wild-type influenza virus and LAIV may induce protective immunity through similar mechanisms that are distinct from those of IIV. Of note, it has been proposed that antibodies targeting conserved virus components, including the stalk domain of HA from the group 1 influenza A viruses [32, 33] and the NP [22], have potential as the basis of universal influenza vaccines that would offer protection against a broad range of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. This is consistent with the data showing that LAIV is superior to IIV in inducing cross-protection [3]. The basis for differences in B-cell responses to influenza virus infection and IIV immunization is currently unknown and should be addressed in future studies that include analyses of immunoglobulin gene sequences and antibody functions of the activated B-cell repertoire at the clonal level [34] and also, of course, T-cell responses. Elucidating different aspects of immune responses to natural influenza virus infection and identifying the immune correlates with protective immunity will be important for development of next-generation influenza vaccines.",

            "text": "Because of the repeated exposure to influenza virus infection and vaccination, the B-cell response to influenza vaccination is an antigen recall response in almost all individuals [25], except for very young children who are naive to influenza virus infection and vaccination. Activation of antigen-specific B cells occurs in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues with the help of antigen-specific follicular helper T-cells and results in generation of plasmablasts and switched memory B cells that express high-affinity antibodies [36, 37]. Exposure to a newly emerged strain, such as A(H1N1)pdm09, primes strain-specific B cells and T-cells to generate memory cells that in turn alter the B-cell response to a subsequent vaccination or infection. In the current study, we showed that priming with IIV resulted in diminished strain-specific recall responses to a subsequent IIV immunization, whereas such suppression was not observed in individuals with prior natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. LAIV immunization also does not result in detectable differences in the serum antibody and plasmablast responses to IIV or LAIV immunization in the subsequent year [29]. A recent study found that immunization with a live, attenuated avian H5N1 influenza vaccine, which stimulated virtually no serum antibodies, effectively primed the immune system, resulting in a robust serum antibody response to a subsequent immunization with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine including broader cross-reactivity, compared with repeated immunization with the inactivated vaccine alone [38]. In mice primed with a T-cell\u2013dependent antigen, a second immunization with an epitope-matched T-cell independent antigen results in induction of tolerant memory B cells rather than a recall response [39]. A substantial CD4+ T-cell response was detected in volunteers experimentally infected with wild-type influenza viruses [40]. In another human study a specific subset of ICOS+CXCR3+CXCR5+CD4+ follicular helper T-cells correlated with the induction of antibodies to IIV in previously primed individuals but not in naive subjects [41]. Thus, deficiencies in the magnitude or functional properties of the CD4+ T-cell repertoire specific for IIV are likely a contributing factor to the reduced B-cell response in repeated IIV immunization. The efficacy of repeated IIV immunization has been an issue of debate for some time [42\u201346]. However, this controversy has not previously focused specifically on the generation of humoral immunity in recipients of repeated IIV immunization in comparison to those previously primed by natural infection. Since annual immunization with IIV is common practice, the implication of our findings to the long-term effectiveness of influenza vaccination needs to be carefully evaluated, especially in the context of maximizing protective immunity in vulnerable populations, such as elderly individuals.",

A pool of PPAbs from a subset (n = 23) of 2010/2011 inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) recipients (IIV pool) was also tested. This PPAb pool was assembled by combining equal amounts of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from each PPAb sample prepared with blood samples collected 6\u20138 days after IIV receipt.

Forty-three healthy individuals who did not receive a monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in 2009 and were immunized with an A(H1N1)pdm09-containing IIV for the first time were included for this analysis. A, Plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) were collected after the first immunization with the A(H1N1)pdm09-containing IIV in 2010 or 2011. The PPAb reactivities were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for binding to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of homologous A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1), heterovariant A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) (sH1), and heterosubtypic A/Vietnam/1203/2004(H5N1) (H5). The baseline seronegative (A[H1N1]pdm09 neutralizing titer <10, n = 17) and baseline seropositive (A[H1N1]pdm09 neutralizing titer >10, n = 26) vaccinees were compared. B, A subset (n = 18) of the 2010/2011 IIV vaccinees were immunized with the A[H1N1]pdm09-containing IIV in 2012. The PPAbs collected after each immunization were analyzed by ELISA for binding to the HAs pH1, sH1, and H5. C, Comparison of the priming effect of natural A[H1N1]pdm09 infection versus that of IIV immunization. The priming effect of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was defined as the ratio of the mean area under the curve (AUC) for baseline seropositive individuals to the mean AUC for baseline seronegative individuals. The priming effect of IIV was defined as the ratio of the mean AUC of the second immunization to the mean AUC of the first immunization. Horizontal bars in panels A and B indicate geometric mean AUCs. Hypotheses were tested with unpaired (A) or paired (B) t tests. Because the 2 data sets (in panels A and B) had some subjects in common, analysis used perturbation resampling [18], which is essentially a smoothed bootstrap. The P values were adjusted by sequential Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons across all 9 tests in the figure. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference after the adjustment.",
