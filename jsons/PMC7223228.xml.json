GLF as a trauma mechanism may appear \u201cinsignificant\u201d, however, frequently resulting in serious injuries especially in the head and cervical region [12, 13]. A study by Velmahos et al. reported that during a 9-month study period 37% of patients admitted to a Level I trauma center after GLF or low-level fall had significant injuries often requiring ICU admission [12]. An independent risk factor for significant injuries was older age, thus, both our study regions are at a \u201crisk group\u201d with a rather high mean age and significant proportion of GLF\u2014particularly in Southern Finland with almost quarter of the patients being older than 65 years. Also, frequent use of anticoagulants among elderly population exposes to a higher risk for hemorrhage.",

A recent study by Haltmeier et al. investigating patients with severe isolated head injury and field GCS < 9 reported significantly higher mortality for patients with pre-hospital endotracheal intubation compared to patients without pre-hospital intubation performed [15]. A study by Bossers and colleagues observed that outcome of pre-hospital intubation depends on the skills and experience of the pre-hospital providers and should be abandoned when a provider lacks ample training [16]. In the current study, the pre-hospital intubation rate was notably higher in the Finnish trauma system. The causality for this observation is unclear and may be related to greater transportation distances at the catchment area of the HUH and more frequent presence of a physician on the scene. However, as TTR does not register if the on-scene care provider was a paramedic or physician, a detailed analysis is not feasible, thus, this serves as a quality improvement purpose for the TTR to add a data field to record if a paramedic or physician was on-scene.",

Also, both regions showed better outcome compared to predicted mortality per TRISS methodology, however, due to relatively low number of cases the SMR should be interpreted with caution.

One of the most important limitations is simplistic dichotomous stratification of age variable: \u2264 55 and > 55 years. With increasing average of life-expectancy and evolving medical care make such a strict cut-off per age questionable. Also, some authors have shown that TRISS performance is low for traumatic brain injuries and for certain mechanisms of injuries. Kennedy and co-authors noted that TRISS methodology has a poor performance for patients after low-level falls [19]. Patients in this subgroup have frequently many chronic medical conditions with an effect on outcomes.",
