Sequences from viruses circulating in Asia were present within each of the clusters and subgroups, indicating that a range of different viruses are circulating in Asia. All the US PEDV sequences were clustered into one group, but a sub-division of an original strain and a new variant strain can be made. Analysis of the European PEDV sequences is very limited, since there are only a few sequences available from viruses circulating in the 1970-80's, and the only others are from viruses circulating recently in Germany and Italy. There is high sequence identity between these very recently circulating German and Italian viruses and the US PEDV strains, but more studies are required in order to compare the virulence of these different viruses.

The severity of disease associated with PEDV within a herd is variable and is highly dependent on the age of the infected pigs and on the level of immunity in the population.

Faecal crosscontamination of blood during collection at slaughterhouses cannot be excluded. Infectious virus has been detected in air collected under experimental conditions and so PEDV might be transmitted via the air for short distances. Low levels of PEDV RNA have been detected in semen but there are no data available on the presence of infectious virus in this matrix. Currently, there are no available data on the presence of PEDV in embryos, pork meat or other porcine derived feed components such as red blood cells, hydrolysed proteins, fat, gelatine and collagen.

At the time of its emergence in Europe PED was confused with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), a diarrheal disease of pigs caused by a coronavirus of the same group as the one of PED. However, the two coronaviruses did not show a direct antigenic relationship and thus the two viruses were considered two different etiological agents. Then, in the 1980's and 1990's the evolution of the two viruses was rather different. In fact, as regards as TGEV, a mutant of the virus with tropism for the respiratory tract appeared in the pig population and become widespread in the world inducing a cross protecting immunity to TGEV that led to a gradual disappearance of TGEV, and the associated enteric disease. Instead, PED remained enzootic in the European pig population and the severity of the clinical disease was related to the immune-status of the affected herd. In cases where the disease agent was introduced into a nonimmune, fully susceptible population, clinical symptoms were severe, and mortality in neonatal piglets could reach up to 80%.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BACKGROUND AS PROVIDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION"}, {"text": "In the 1980's and 1990's outbreaks of PED became less frequent in Europe, while the virus persisted in the pig population and occasionally limited outbreaks were reported in some countries.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the virus spread throughout Europe, causing outbreaks of watery diarrhoea in swine of all ages. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, the number of PED outbreaks decreased markedly in the region. Some European countries (i.e. Scandinavian countries) have never reported outbreaks or the detection of PEDV.

This variant strain has 99% 19 nucleotide identity at the whole-genome level and 97% 19 nucleotide identity in the full-length S gene, compared with the original PEDV isolates clustered in the original strain reported in the USA ( Figure  1 ). The variant strains, also referred to as the S INDEL strain by some laboratories in the USA, have some small deletions and insertions within the S1 coding region, resulting in only 89-93.8 % nucleotide identity within part of the S1 coding region compared with the original PEDV isolates reported in the USA (Chen et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2014a) . The new variant strain was reported to appear less virulent than the original US strains based on field reports, with piglets from infected sows showing minimal clinical signs and no mortality (Wang et al., 2014a) . However, it remains to be confirmed whether the variant induces less severe clinical disease in PEDV naive animals. This new variant is more closely related to a Chinese strain than to the other PEDV strains currently circulating in the US, and it has been shown, retrospectively, to have been present in the USA pig population since May 2013. This indicates that at least two strains of PEDV were introduced into the US at a similar time and are now co-circulating in the USA pig population (Huang et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014a) . , inducing watery diarrhea and killing approximately 20 infected pigs in a fattening herd of 1400 animals. Sequence analysis showed the closest identity was to the new variant PEDV-Am strain (99.5% identity of the full genome compared with PEDV-Am OH851). A phylogenetic tree based on the S gene is presented in Figure 2 . Another German PEDV recently circulating in North-Rhine Westphalia showed high sequence identity to PEDV circulating in the USA (99% of a 651nucleotide fragment of the S gene) (Henniger and Schwarz, 2014). A large fattening farm was affected. Despite the very high morbidity in feeders and finishers (almost 100%), none of the infected animals died. The sequences of several Italian PEDVs circulating in the period 2007-2014, which induced diarrhea and mortality in piglets, show that these recently circulating viruses cluster into three groups that are different from the cluster of the old PEDV-EU isolates Sozzi et al., 2014) . One of the Italian clusters, including the only two sequences from 2014, has higher sequence identity to the PEDV-Am variant strain when analyzing the full S gene sequence. Taken together, it can be concluded that PEDVs with high sequence identity to the US PEDV strain are currently circulating in Europe, but more analyses and additional sequence data are required to understand PEDV evolution in Europe and a possible link with PEDV strains circulating in other parts of the world. Although PEDV isolates from the USA and recent isolates (2014) from Germany and Italy cluster together, there are not enough data to compare their phenotypic characteristics. Comparing the virulence/pathogenicity of different PEDV isolates would require comparative animal experiments. As already mentioned above, some studies describe PEDV isolates which might have altered pathogenicity (Li et al., 2012a; Yang et al., 2013b; Wang et al., 2014a) , but side-by-side animal experiments including the different strains are required to assess potential differences in pathogenic effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 622, "end": 642, "text": "(Chen et al., 2014a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 643, "end": 662, "text": "Wang et al., 2014a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 858, "end": 878, "text": "(Wang et al., 2014a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1393, "text": "(Huang et al., 2013;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1413, "text": "Chen et al., 2014a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2368, "text": "Sozzi et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 3245, "end": 3263, "text": "(Li et al., 2012a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3264, "end": 3283, "text": "Yang et al., 2013b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 3284, "end": 3303, "text": "Wang et al., 2014a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 310, "text": "Figure  1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1736, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Description"}, {"text": "The high level of sequence identity between different strains of PEDV would suggest that there should be antigenic cross-reactivity between them, albeit changes in individual epitopes could occur (Hao et al., 2014) .
