Plant viruses possess only limited genetic information; hence, to complete their infection cycles, interactions between virus proteins and necessary host factors is critical. For a virus to successfully infect different plant hosts, the limited number of virus-encoded proteins must have the ability to recognize and interact with factors in different hosts for a successful infection. For some plant viruses, host plants restrict viral cell-to-cell movement rather than viral replication, which results in a subliminal infection (Cheo, 1970, Sulzinski and Zaitlin, 1982). In other cases, viruses may move from cell-to-cell, but the plant prevents viral long-distance spread (Fujita et al., 1996, Saenz et al., 2002, Wang et al., 1998). Failure to accomplish any of the stages can be thought of as resistance.",

            "text": "In our previous studies, we collected several isolates of Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV) for construction of virus-induced gene silencing vectors for orchid functional genomic studies (Lu et al., 2007). CymMV is a prevalent orchid virus and belongs to the genus Potexvirus in the family Flexiviridae (Adams et al., 2005b). The recorded natural host range is largely limited to species belonging to Orchidaceae (ICTVdB: The Universal Virus Database of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [http://www.ictvdb.iacr. ac.uk/Ictv/fr-index.htm.];(Adams et al., 2005a, Zettler et al., 1990). Interestingly, we found two distinct CymMV isolates, M1 and M2, both of which can infect Phalaenopsis orchids, but only M1 can systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Because both isolates can systemically infect orchids, this suggests that viral-encoded replication and movement proteins are functional in orchids. However, because only M1 can systemically infect N. benthamiana plants this suggests that M1-encoded proteins could interact successfully with factors in both plant species to allow a systemic infection, but M2-encoded proteins do not. M1 and M2 share very high nucleotide sequence identity (97%), which suggests that subtle differences contribute to the differences in host reaction.",

            "text": "Viruses in the genus Potexvirus have monopartite, positive-sense single-strand RNA genomes (Adams et al., 2005a). Studies of potexviruses have contributed importantly to our understanding of the complexity of the mechanisms of plant virus movement within plants (Lucas, 2006, Verchot-Lubicz, 2005, Verchot-Lubicz et al., 2007). Comprehensive studies of potexviruses has revealed that triple gene block proteins (TGBps) and coat proteins (CP) work cooperatively to promote viral movement between cells and long-distance in their plant hosts (Bayne et al., 2005, Beck et al., 1991, Chapman et al., 1992, Fedorkin et al., 2001, Forster et al., 1992, Ju et al., 2007, Krishnamurthy et al., 2003, Lin et al., 2006, Lough et al., 1998\nLough et al., 2000, Mitra et al., 2003, Tamai and Meshi, 2001, Verchot-Lubicz, 2005). The current model suggests that TGBp1 increases the plasmodesmatal size-exclusion limit and moves into neighboring cells to suppress RNA silencing (Bayne et al., 2005, Howard et al., 2004); both TGBp1 and CP bind viral RNA (vRNA) forming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP; (Karpova et al., 2006, Lough et al., 2000\n, 2001); the complex is then delivered by TGBp2 induced vesicles (containing TGBp3) to plasmodesmata, and through plasmodesmata to neighboring cells; later, after the free form of TGBp1 binds membrane-associated TGBp2 and/or TGBp3, then TGBp1 (on the vRNP complex) binds with the membrane-associated TGBp1 complex (TGBp1 with TGBp2 or TGBp3) to form a membrane-bound complex and begin new rounds of replication (Verchot-Lubicz, 2005).",

Interestingly, trans-complementation of TGBps between potexvirus species was not successful, and it was suggested that species-specific interactions among potexvirus movement proteins are obligatory for cell-to-cell movement (Lin et al., 2006). However, trans-complementation of movement defective potexviruses by movement proteins derived from Tomato mosaic tobamovirus, Crucifer tobamovirus and Red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus have been reported (Morozov et al., 1997).",

In this study, we aimed to use our CymMV-M1, -M2 and N. benthamiana system to study the molecular basis of CymMV isolate-dependent host movement determinants, and to resolve the mechanism involved in CymMV translocation. Our studies not only help to identify the molecular determinants of CymMV isolate-dependent host movement, but other phenomena that are not easily resolved by studies using a single isolate. Finally, our efforts revealed two control behaviors, dominant and matching modes, involved in CymMV host dependent movement, and showed that the binding strength between the CymMV CP and genomic RNA is correlated with the dominant control mode.",

Because M1 and M2 share a very high nucleotide sequence identity (97%), we attempted to identify the individual, important amino acids of the CP that allowed for the CymMV systemic infection of N. benthamiana plants. Sequence alignment of the M1 and M2 CPs revealed only four amino acid differences (Figs. 6\nA, B). Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed to construct a series of CymMV-M2 CP mutants containing specific M1 CP amino acids (Figs. 6C\u2013I). All constructs were replication competent in protoplasts as assayed by northern blot hybridization (Fig. 6J), and statistics analysis (ANOVA) of real-time RT-PCR quantification of average relative percentage (from 3 independent experiments) of CymMV RNA from CymMV clone-infected protoplasts at 24 h post-inoculation revealed no significant difference in percentage between these clones (P\n = 0.83). Transcripts derived from each construct were used to inoculate N. benthamiana plants. These analyses showed that the CP amino acid G82A and L89P changes were both required for M2 to systemically infect N. benthamiana plants (Figs. 6C, H). Interestingly, these amino acids are located within the previously predicted RNA binding domain of the CP (Fig. 7\nA).",

Our results indicated that the important amino acids of the CP that allowed for the CymMV systemic infection are located within the previously predicted RNA binding domain (Fig. 7A; 1). Thus, it might be that the binding affinity between CPs and RNAs of CymMV M1 and M2 may play roles in CymMV movement, and therefore we attempted to analyze and compare their binding affinities. Because the whole genomic RNA of CymMV is 6227 nucleotides in length, which made conventional gel-shift assays difficult, we performed modified RNA\u2013protein pull-down assays for our analyses. Our data indicated that CymMV M1 CP has a higher binding affinity as compared to CymMV M2 CP (Fig. 7D, lanes 1\u20134). We then also performed CP and CymMV RNA binding assays on CymMV M2 CP with the amino acid changes G82A and L89P (derived from clone pCymMV-M2-CP-GL/AP; Fig. 6H). The results indicated that with these amino acid changes (G82A and L89P), the binding affinity was higher as compared to wild-type CymMV-M2 CP (Fig 7D, lanes 3,4,5 and 6).",

Interestingly, our data also showed that if CP was not properly functional (e.g., M2 CP), alterations in TGBps (e.g., M1 TGBp1 and 3) may compensate for the function of CP and allow CymMV to systemically infect N. benthamiana plants (Fig. 3F). In addition, when comparing pCymMV-M2/TGB-M1 and pCymMV-M1/CP-M2 (Figs. 3F and G), only pCymMV-M2/TGB-M1 was movement competent. The TGBps and CP are the same in both chimeric viruses. These data indicate that another control mode which required correct matching of the particular movement accessory components (M2 5\u2032 RNA, TGBp1 and TGBp3 and M2 CP) also allowed the systemic infection of CymMV in N. benthamiana (Fig. 3F and Fig. 5).

However, no matter what the proposed form of vRNP that moves between cells, all data suggest that potexvirus CP and vRNA are involved in forming the vRNP which traffics to the plasmodesmata. Our analysis indicated that the CymMV CP-vRNA binding affinity likely plays an important role in CymMV movement in N. benthamiana plants.

It has been previously reported that in systemic hosts of PVX, the movement of TGBps are host dependent (Krishnamurthy et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2000). Because in different hosts the cellular conditions and morphology are different, it is possible that potexviruses may use different strategies to adapt to different hosts. Adjusting movement accessory components could be an efficient way to generate the diversity of functions in response to changes of cellular conditions and provide flexibility for virus movement in different hosts, and thus could be an advantage for viruses with modular designed movement proteins (Morozov and Solovyev, 2003).",

Although, currently the roles of NTPase/helicase domains in potexvirus movement have not been well established (Verchot-Lubicz et al., 2007), mutations eliminating the DEY motif affects the protein subcellular targeting and mutations eliminating the DEY and GKS motifs inhibit the ability of TGBp1 to increase plasmodesmata size-exclusion limits as well as virus movement (Angell et al., 1996, Lough et al., 1998, Morozov et al., 1999). The amino acids identified in CymMV TGBp1 that are required for CymMV-M2 movement in N. benthamiana are within the NTPase/helicase domain, but not in the conserved motifs (Fig. 9). The amino acids are also not in the positions within the NTPase/helicase domain previously reported as essential for Bamboo mosaic potexvirus movement (Lin et al., 2004). Within the potexvirus TGBp3, a transmembrane domain has been previously reported. PVX with substitution mutations within the transmembrane domain is restricted to a single cell, and PVX with mutations outside the transmembrane domain show reduced movement between cells and may not move systemically (Krishnamurthy et al., 2003). The amino acids identified in TGBp3 which are important for CymMV-M2 movement in N. benthamiana are not located in the transmembrane domain (Fig. 9; Krishnamurthy et al., 2003). Because all amino acids identified in CymMV TGBp1 and TGBp3 are not located in the conserved motifs previously identified among potexviruses, nor within the amino acids reported as essential for potexvirus movement, we speculate that changes in these regions may only slightly affect but not abolish the function (as we see in the case of CymMV-M2 CP) of TGBp1 and TGBp3, and the differential function required for virus movement is host dependent. This may explain why M1 and M2 can both systemically infect Phalaenopsis orchid, but only M1 can systemically infect N. benthamiana.",

Black and gray lines indicate different amino acids between pCymMV-M1 and pCymMV-M2, respectively. Positions of amino acids are indicated. Chimeric viruses competent in protoplast accumulation and systemic infection in N. benthamiana plants are indicated by +, and the ratio of systemic infected to total inoculated plants is indicated. Systemic infection was detected 2 weeks post-inoculation by RT-PCR. (P) Protoplast infectivity was detected 24 h post-inoculation by northern blot hybridization, and the ribosomal RNA used for a loading control are indicated. Genomic RNA (G), TGBp, and CP subgenomic RNA are indicated. The pCymMV-R- used as a negative control is illustrated in Fig. 1. The average percentage of relative real-time RT-PCR quantification (from 3 independent experiments) of CymMV RNA from CymMV clone-infected protoplasts at 24 h post-inoculation is indicated below the gels. The accumulation of pCymMV-M1 was set at 100% for relative quantification. Numbers at the left correspond to positions of marker RNAs (sizes in 1000 nucleotides) analyzed in the same gel.",

            "text": "Fig. 9: The amino acid sequence alignment of TGBp1 NTP/helicase domain and TGBp3 transmembrane domain of potexvirus. The amino acid sequence alignments were conducted by use of clustal X 1.83 (Thompson et al., 1997). (A) The conserved motifs of the potexvirus NTPase/helicase domain were previously predicted (Kalinina et al., 2002). The 7 predicted NTPase/helicase motifs of potexvirus TGBp1 are shown, and two canonical motifs of NTPase, DEY and GKS, are indicated. The arrows indicate the amino acid positions important for pCymMV-M2 to systemically infect N. benthamiana. (B) The potexvirus TGBp3 transmembrane domain was previously identified (Krishnamurthy et al., 2003). The CymMV transmembrane domain predicted by DAS program (http://www.sbc.su.se/~miklos/DAS/maindas.html) is indicated by a thick black line. The arrows indicate the amino acids important for pCymMV-M2 to systemically infect N. benthamiana. The viruses, abbreviation and accession number used in alignments of TGBp1 NTP/helicase and TGbp3 transmembrane domains are described below. Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV, accession number AY571289); Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV, accession number AY571289); Foxtail mosaic virus (FMV, accession number NC_001483); Watermelon spotted wilt virus (BSMV, accession number NC_003481); Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV, accession number NC_001658); Papaya mosaic virus (PMV, accession number NC_001748); Cactus virus X (CVX, accession number NC_002815); Potato virus X (PVX, accession number NC_001455); White clover mosaic virus (WC1MV, accession number X06728).",
