The incidence of the disease is high in Iran (4.6 per 1,000,000) (Lai et al., 2020). Since Iran is one of the countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19, people's knowledge and attitude play important roles in preventing the disease. The issue is even more prominent for patients who receive immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, like for MS patients. MS patients use disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) to control relapses and to decrease the progression of the disease (Azimi et al., 2019, Azimi et al., 2020), which predisposes them to the increased risk of infections (Wijnands et al., 2018).",
