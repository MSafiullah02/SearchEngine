Through the emergence of conservation medicine as an important field of study in biodiversity management, we have come to appreciate that disease is often a significant risk factor in conservation programmes involving animal\u2010movement protocols, such as translocation, transportation among zoos or reintroduction. Despite our ability to recognize these risks, however, professionals in the zoo and wildlife medicine community have historically been hard\u2010pressed to find and apply appropriate tools that can effectively analyse these risks and use the resultant information to develop more sound programmes. With the absence of such tools, conservation medicine professionals would often adopt a \u2018zero\u2010risk tolerance\u2019 approach to animal\u2010movement recommendations. Using this approach, any perceptible risk of disease introduction or transmission is seen as excessive in the context of maintaining the health of managed individuals, and is therefore unrealistically strict as it fails to recognize that virtually any management action inherently involves risk.",

It is therefore critically important to develop a comprehensive, unified and broadly applicable set of descriptive and analytical tools that can more realistically and accurately assess disease\u2010based risks in conservation\u2010based animal\u2010movement programmes.",

To help accomplish this goal, participants also set forth a model for standardizing the collection of relevant information across a range of conservation disciplines.

We have found two similar system modelling platforms to be outstanding tools in this regard. Perhaps the more popular of the two is Stella (current version 9\u00b70; isee Systems, 2006, Lebanon, NH, USA), a software package that provides an environment to interactively visualize how complex systems are structured and how they function, thereby creating a graphical representation of our current beliefs and understanding of the problem being considered. Equally important is the ability to use this tool to communicate the system's structure to a wide audience more effectively through the use of diagrams, charts and associated text boxes that can be tailored to particular learning styles. Because of its relative ease of use and graphical nature, Stella is an excellent tool for bringing together experts from diverse disciplines around the description of a given system. Vensim (current version 5\u00b76; Ventana Systems, 2006, Harvard, MA, USA) uses a very similar methodology for creating these visual models and can be obtained at a much lower cost in a scaled\u2010down package for broader use.

The underlying question driving the assessment was: \u2018Should the children of trackers be vaccinated for measles as a way to minimize risk of disease to the gorillas?\u2019 The system visualization led to detailed discussion about the probability that other children in the village, who were not members of tracker's families, could spread measles virus to the trackers. Preliminary results suggested that simply focusing on the families of trackers would not significantly reduce the risk of measles transmission to the nearby Mountain gorilla population. Major village\u2010 or region\u2010wide public\u2010health efforts would be necessary to make vaccination of children protective for gorillas.

An excellent example of this type of modelling approach in the field of conservation medicine is a technique known as decision analysis. This is simply a method for constructing another type of visual representation of the situation of interest, this time incorporating the decision maker's understanding regarding uncertainty within that system, so that the best decision can be made (i.e. the optimal outcome can be achieved).

Decision trees provide a formal graphical structure in which decisions and chance events are linked from left to right in the order they would occur. (For example, before you decide whether to treat an individual for a disease, you need to determine if the individual tests positive for the disease.) The result is a tree structure with the \u2018root\u2019 on the left and branches for each chance event or decision extending to the right. Probabilities of events occurring and, optionally, payoffs for events and decisions are added to each node in the tree. The graphical nature of the tree provides an explicit visual understanding of the decisions being contemplated, as with the use of Stella and Vensim, with the added computational rigor necessary to justify the choice of a specific set of optimal choices. A decision analysis in Precision Tree generates a risk profile, which compares the payoffs and risks of different decision options. The cumulative risk profile graph displays a cumulative distribution showing the probability of an outcome less than or equal to a certain value.

There is particular attention given to the specifics regarding quarantine of animals, including specification and associated justification for the duration of quarantine. This kind of information is invaluable to others when planning future movements of the same species at a later date or under similar circumstances. The subject of diagnostic sample collection, storage and transport is also given ample attention in the worksheet. In recognition of the fact that in many cases the persons collecting diagnostic samples from animals in the field will not be veterinarians, a simple guide to sample collection and handling is provided as an attachment to the hardcopy version of the worksheet. It is highly recommended that the techniques are practiced \u2013 preferably under veterinary supervision \u2013 before samples are collected in the field. The value of the samples will directly reflect the quality of the processes used to collect and handle them. Finally, appendices to the worksheet include notes on qualitative and quantitative risk analysis methods, diagnostic test specificity and sensitivity and choice of optimal sample size for developing baseline data.",

One such factor is infectious disease and its transmission dynamics among co\u2010existing human and animal populations. Typically, models of wildlife population viability do not adequately reflect the demographic effect of disease on a population, which can vary considerably depending upon the structure of the host population, the characteristics of the infectious agent, and environmental variables such as habitat condition and availability (but see Haydon et al., 2006, for an outstanding exception to this generality).",

As a result, these models produce estimates of morbidity and mortality without considering the important effects of random demographic, environmental and genetic factors. In other words, they lack the core components that make effective population viability analysis (PVA) models inherently useful: an explicit treatment of the intrinsic and extrinsic stochastic forces that put small populations of wildlife at risk of extinction. By developing a detailed, individual\u2010based simulation modelling package of the epidemiology of wildlife disease [see Barlow (1995) for a discussion of the value of individual\u2010based models], and by studying the impacts of disease on population viability through its linkage with an existing PVA model, our understanding of (1) the process of disease transmission in small wildlife populations subject to unpredictable demography and (2) the interactions that occur among demographic factors, environmental variables, disease pathogens and host genetics to impact endangered population persistence, could be greatly enhanced. This integrated product would provide an outstanding opportunity for productive collaboration between the wildlife ecology and veterinary communities. Moreover, such a package could serve as a unique teaching vehicle for students in these fields of study. Through this process, an effort like this can also promote a more intimate integration of scientific disciplines \u2013 an endeavor that has recently been argued as vital to the success of biodiversity conservation and its inherent complexity (2002, 2002, 1999, 2003).",

The resulting Microsoft Windows software package, titled outbreak, simulates SEIR \u2013 style disease dynamics, using the basic conceptual algorithms of Anderson (1982) and May (1986) as a foundation. The prevalence of infectious disease in wildlife populations is dependent on the number of individuals already infected, as well as on the numbers of susceptible and exposed individuals. To model infectious processes, the state of each individual in the population is tracked, and the probabilities of transition among states are specified as functions of the number of individuals currently in each state and of other relevant parameters, such as contact rate and the latent period of infection. Multiple iterations of a given dataset are used to generate mean population characteristics as model output for analysis.",

In this way, an individual's demographic behavior will change over the duration of the simulation as they are exposed to the infectious agent, contract the disease and later acquire resistance (if applicable for the disease of concern). All other aspects of population dynamics unrelated to disease, such as annual variation in demographic rates, catastrophic events that dramatically reduce reproduction and/or survival, dispersal and migration between metapopulations, will be handled directly within Vortex. This flexibility allows the user to develop any number of sophisticated population viability modelling scenarios with or without the additional complexity of detailed infectious disease epidemiology, and to graphically compare the results. The flexibility of this \u2018meta\u2010modelling\u2019 process (Miller & Lacy, 2003b) results in a versatile PVA modelling environment that is of considerably greater depth than other packages currently available and greatly facilitates the creation of interdisciplinary collaborative teams that are so important to effectively address today's complex issues in conservation medicine (Westley & Miller, 2003).",
