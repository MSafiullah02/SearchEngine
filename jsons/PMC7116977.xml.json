Numerous infectious agents, have been linked to ADEM. Viruses that have been implicated include coronavirus, coxsackie virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, measles virus, rubella virus, varicella zoster virus, and West Nile virus [1], [2], [3]. Other organisms associated include Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia, Leptospira, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rickettsia, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Less than 5% of all ADEM cases follow immunization. Postvaccinal ADEM has been associated with immunization for rabies, hepatitis B, influenza, Japanese B encephalitis, diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, polio, smallpox, and varicella [4].",

Multiphasic DEM (MDEM) describes recurrent disease that fulfills criteria for ADEM but involves new anatomic areas of the CNS upon recurrence. Symptoms and signs are different from those in the initial event.

ADEM associated with HCV has been reported before [9], and recently Sim et al. report a case of ADEM associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with positive serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-HCV antibody [15]. In a case of acute transverse myelitis associated with chronic HCV infection, anti-HCV antibody was present in the CSF [16]. It is hypothesized that the virus might have penetrated blood brain barrier and involved the CNS directly. Likewise, patients with HBV infection should be examined carefully for CNS symptoms during follow up.",

Although the PCR DNA analysis has not confirmed viremia, liver biopsy showed the active chronic hepatitis, which indicates the possibility of inoculation of the virus in hepatocytes and probable reinfecton. This case shows that HBV infection can be associated with ADEM, so the possibility of HBV infection should be investigated in cases of ADEM. We suppose that virus-triggered autoimmunity or direct viral invasion played a role in the genesis of ADEM. Molecular mimicry between HB antigen(s) and one or more myelin proteins, or a non-specific activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, could constitute possible pathogenetic mechanisms for these adverse neurological events [17].",
