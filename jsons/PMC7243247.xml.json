Although this disease is predominantly confined within a particular region of the world, after the recent outbreak of several such (previously considered strictly regional) diseases, it is difficult to ignore the potential global impact of any spreadable illness. JEV is a vector borne disease that transmits to humans via cycles between infected Culex mosquitos and vertebrates. The single-stranded RNA positive JEV belongs to the Flaviviridae family that also includes dengue, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile, Zika, and yellow fever viruses. The flavivirus consists of three structural portions: (i) capsid, commonly known as C; (ii) pre-membrane or membrane protein, PrM or M; and (iii) envelope protein E. The E protein (a homodimer) is considered to be the main site for host-virus attachment and consists of three structural domains: domain 1 (D1), domain II (D2), and domain III (D3). The envelope protein D3 (ED3) is the main interacting site for the JEV neutralizing antibodies. The non-structural (NS) protein includes seven nonstructural units [15\u201321].",

Likewise, the crystal structure of the complete envelope protein of JEV is also available in the literature [21], and the structure of the corresponding ED3 has been identified as 1PJW.PDB [22]. In view of the scope for preventive and therapeutic interventions, the significance of the ED3 epitopes and \u201cneutralization escape\u201d mutants of ED3 in the Flaviviridae family has been noted in several earlier studies [15\u201317, 20, 23, 24]. Previous authors have also identified certain regions/residues on the JEV-E protein as determining factors for functional epitopes [21, 22, 25\u201330]. While experimental research about the Flaviviridae virus family has been active for a number of years, molecular level structural/computational studies of conformational changes (involving functional epitopes and escape mutants) of the JEV ED3 have so far remained comparatively less explored.",

Alterations of Ser331 and Asp332 on ED3 can significantly lower their binding affinity toward specific mAb sites, and therefore, these critical residue mutations behave like \u201cneutralizing antibody\u201d escapes. By using site-directed mutagenesis and ELISA affinity assay, Lin and Wu have shown that, the altered 331 and 332 residues, (Ser331Lys, Ser331Arg, and Ser331Glu) and (Asp332Leu, Asp332Lys, and Asp332Arg) in JEV ED3 fusion proteins undergo complete loss of binding affinity against mAb E3.3. However, there are four additional variants (Ser331Leu, Ser331Gln/Asp332Gln, Asp332Glu) and Ala substitutions at position 331 and 332 that exhibit moderate to low reductions in their binding affinities toward mAb E3.3. The reasons why these residue mutations would cause a decrease or a complete loss of function (neutralizing activity) have also been discussed previously [27]. This present work centers on the impact of escape mutants on the structure and function of the overall ED3.",

MD simulation is an established technique, useful for identifying structure-function relationships of proteins in general. Previous MD-based studies by the present author have described the structures and time-dependent dynamics of several immunologically relevant proteins [33\u201338]. Other authors have reported MD simulation studies of the dengue ED3 protein in the aqueous medium [39, 40]. The primary goal of the current work is to investigate the time-dependent structural changes of some of the neutralizing escape mutant proteins as those described by Lin and Wu on the JEV ED3 [27]. The motivation for this effort stems from the observation that such residue level structural studies using wt or mutant JEV ED3 proteins may provide useful information in epitope mapping and novel antibody\u2013based therapeutics.",

First, using the NPT ensemble, each system was energy-minimized and equilibrated for 10,000 steps. The final production run was performed for 5 ns using the NVT ensemble at a constant temperature of 298 K. The CHARMM force field was used. Periodic boundary conditions and Langevin dynamics were applied for each of the systems studied. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was activated for each run. The integration time step was 1.0 fs, and the total number of steps during the final run was set to 5 \u00d7 106, which corresponded to 5 ns in length. MD simulations of such time scale can be carried out with relatively moderate computational resources and, at the same time, can serve as an effective probe of the basic conformational changes in the protein [43, 44]. The detailed output frequencies of the trajectory coordinate files have been described previously [33\u201336]. The VMD program [42] was used to analyze these trajectory structures, and the corresponding figures were generated with Discovery Studio Visualizer (DSV) [45]. Origin 9.1 was used for trajectory analyses.",

Among the three mutant proteins considered here, the mutation of Ser40Lys (plot b) in Fig. 3a shows the highest RMSD values compared with those of the (a) wt 1PJW and the other two structural variants, (c) Ser40Arg and (d) Ser40Glu. The mutant proteins Ser40Arg and Ser40Glu have slightly lower RMSD values than those of the wt protein (Fig 3a), especially during the last 1 ns of the simulation. Mostly, similar results are observed also for the individual mutant residues Arg40 and Glu40 (Fig. 3b). The mutant Lys40 residue indicates slightly higher RMSD values than those of wt Ser40 and the other two mutant variants at position 40. Per residue root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analyses of wt 1PJW are considered in Fig. 3c, which displays mutual overlays of the initial and final conformations as functions of residue numbers.

Accordingly, the highest level of escape mutation may be possible in Ser40Lys due to this protein\u2019s higher RMSD/RMSF rate, secondary-structure deviation, and loss of H bonding. A recent study on influenza virus mutant epitope analysis indicates that certain loss of non-covalent interactions in mutant protein may be related to the latter\u2019s omission of affinity toward antibody [46].

Therefore, the instability of the mutant epitopes in this region may disrupt the normal course of antibody bindings. It is possible that the greater structural movements of mutant epitopes in JEV ED3 (Figs.3a, d and 5a, c) could be related to their structural instability and may reduce their binding interactions toward mAb. Solvent accessibility may play a role in proteins destabilization. Ieong et al. have shown that, in the influenza virus, mutation-mediated increase of solvent accessibility plays a role in disrupting the salt bridges and, eventually destabilizes the protein [46]. Since the mutant residues Lys40 and Arg41 contain relatively larger solvent accessible surfaces, this accessibility may evidently contribute to the unstable nature of Ser40Lys and Asp41Arg. All other mutant residues at position 40 and 41 also display greater SAS values than those of the wt residues Ser40 and Asp41. Residue mutations at position 40 show greater SAS than mutations at position 41. Finally, the higher RMSD/RMSF rates certainly have an impact on the proteins\u2019 overall stability; this may lower the mAb binding probability and finally assist them to be recognized as antibody neutralization escape mutations. In addition to the results presented above, MD simulation data for four more mutant proteins were also obtained. These latter results, presented in ESM Fig. S5A and S5C, demonstrated somewhat higher RMSD values compared with that of the wt 1PJW. These four additional mutations have been known to exhibit decreased binding affinity toward mAb E3.3 [27].",

The structures of the functional epitopes and neutralization escape mutants of JEV ED3 have been studied in this work. A major finding of the study is the identification of significant structural differences between the functional epitopes and escape mutants. Such mutation-generated structural and conformational instabilities of proteins can act to alter their functionalities. Among the different escape mutants studied here, Ser40Lys/Asp41Arg are most unstable while SerGlu40/Asp41Leu are associated with the lowest structural variations. The relatively high RMSD/RMSF values found in the MD results for Ser40Lys can be taken as an indicator of this protein\u2019s elevated level of escape mutation, the changes in its secondary-structure, as well as its lower capacity for H bonding. Overall, the proteins with residue 41 mutations seem more structured than those with residue 40 mutations.",

Based on the current observations, the antibody neutralization escape mutants of JEV could potentially become a future threat to public health on a broad scale. Since RNA viruses have greater adaptability and mutation rates, effective antiviral treatments tend to be rather challenging in such cases. Molecular and structural details of epitope mutations can help to address these challenges. These illustrative results of computer simulation presented in this report serve to reiterate this point in the specific context of JEV escape mutants.",
