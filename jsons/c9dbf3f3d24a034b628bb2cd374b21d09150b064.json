A lot is still unknown about this virus and its impact on our work as we treat patients. To date, laboratory managers have had to make decisions and take action with a lack of scientific evidence, and, therefore, this paper was not meant to be a consensus of good practice, but rather presentation of different approaches taken by laboratory managers from different countries. Covid-19 is not the first or the last emergency crisis that IVF laboratory managers will have to face. This particular experience will hopefully provide laboratory managers a unique perspective on how to plan for and deal with future major events that lead to interruption of IVF services. The practices outlined in this paper will hopefully help formulate good practice for any IVF laboratory responding to a pandemic: whether this pandemic, or the next.",
