Although these reports investigated the risk for the healthcare workers and also made the stringent relative procedure, no one focused on the risk of emergency surgery patients (ESP) with COVID-19 pneumonia. The current study analyzed the clinical symptom of these patients including perioperative patients and postoperative patients. Furthermore the relevant risk for healthcare workers in ESP was clearly described.",

These data suggested that more ESP-infected COVID-19 displayed the clinical symptom of fever than non-COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we analyzed the duration of fever between them, the results showed that the fever in ESP with COVID-19 lasted more than 7 days, markedly exceeded the non-COVID-19 patients (lasted about 3 days) (Figure 1 A) . The level of fever in ESP with COVID-19 was also higher than non-COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1B) . Additionally, more clinical symptoms of dry cough, fatigue, nausea and dizziness in ESP-infected COVID-19 were observed when compared with non-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, of 54 ESP-infected COVID-19, the incidence of dry cough, fatigue, nausea and dizziness in our study was higher than the reported common COVID-19 pneumonia cases 6, 12 .",

Of 43 infected health care workers, almost them were from operation room (anesthesiologist and nurses) and associated surgery departments. All of infected health care workers were directly contacted the ESP with COVID-19 patients, and infected in the January. The number of health care workers who infected in ESP-infected COVID-19 pneumonia significantly decreased after January. Immunosuppressive state was thought to be a common phenomenon in postoperative patients 15, 16 , and will be susceptible to infect severe pneumonia and respiratory pathogens. Jessica et al. reported that cataract surgery was safety in patients who detected negative of Ebola virus in ocular fluid specimens 17 . In Ebola epidemic in Africa, the emergency surgery was thought to be extremely dangerous 8 ESP-infected COVID-19 (100% with fever); 56.4% showed the ground-glass opacity in lung, less than our study (100%); 83.2% of them had lymphocytopenia which was also less than our investigation (100%). One reason for this phenomenon may be the immunosuppressive state or postoperative stress response in patients. Furthermore, 7 (13%) mortality in our report, obviously higher than those reported cases in China, also proves our hypothesis.",

In the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, the research reported the characteristics of human transmission 4, 18 . However, no one concentrated for the ESP in this meantime. In our study, we analyzed all of ESP (164 patients) from January 1 to January 21, 2020, the final date of follow-up was February 5, 2020 in our hospital. We found that these patients had a great threat for health care workers by the February 5. 43 of health care workers, including surgeon, anesthesiologist and associate nurse, were infected by ESP. Two of them were treated in intensive care unit (ICU) because of serious illness. One reason for this phenomenon is that incomplete preoperative examination especially lack of CT scans in lung and nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 pneumonia was carried out in that time. In addition, lack of self-protection not only in gears (N-95 surgical mask and medical disposable chemical protective safety suit) but also in consciousness was a critical cause. In addition, lack of the relative knowledge of respiratory infectious diseases for surgeons is another reasons, conversely, no health care workers of respiratory, contagion section and ICU were infected in this epidemic situation, which proved our hypothesis. Our report aims to remind the health care workers especially take care of ESP to keep their eyes on the COVID-19 pneumonia even in the later stages of work.",

Median age for 46 years (IQR, 25-89), 136 (82.9%) patients were women and 28 (17.1%) patients were men. 2) The fever in postoperative patients with COVID-19 pneumonia continued over 7 days, more than common postoperative patients. In addition, for ESP-infected COVID-19, 81.5% patients displayed couch, 88.9% patients showed fatigue, 96.3% had nausea, 85.2% showed dizziness. 3) All of ESP-infected COVID-19 had the bilateral or unilateral ground-glass opacities in lung CT. 4) Routine blood test displayed the lymphopenia and increased CRP. 5) Strong insidious and infectious risk for clinician. Fever is the commonest postoperative complications, including physiological and pathological pyrexia, seen in medical and surgical settings 13 . Normally, the pathological fever originates in postoperative infection 13 . The physiological pyrexia is derived from digestion of necrosis material, characterized by short-term fever, slight fever and early stage 14 . As we all known, the slight fever is an important clinical symptom in the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia. Chen et al. reported that 70% patients' body temperatures fluctuated within the range of 36.5-38.8\u2103\uff0cthe average of all of the patients' body temperatures was 38.3\u2103. Such important phenomenon was also investigated by a recent research. Although many research showed the slight fever existence in COVID-19 pneumonia and postoperative patients, no one identified the difference between them. In our this study, we analyzed 54 ESP-infected COVID-19 pneumonia, with cardio-thoracic surgery, 3 patients with urology surgery, 7 patients with hepatobiliary surgery. All of ESP with COVID-19 patients displayed postoperative fever, the range of body temperature 37.1-39.6\u2103, the duration was 1-2 week. Of 110 ESP, 31 (28.2%) patients showed lighter fever (range of body temperature 36.3-38.0\u2103). The duration was less than 4 days. Based on our data, we found different both trend and duration in fever between ESP with or without COVID-19 pneumonia. It is an important phenomenon for us to identify the COVID-19 pneumonia in the postoperative patients. Also we think this point will be the early warning for ESP-infected COVID-19 on now and in the future.",

A resent research analyzed the clinical characteristics of caesarean section with COVID-19 infection and denied the risk of vertical transmission. Although lots of cases in the virus pandemic, there was no reports focused on the perioperative or postoperative patients especially during COVID-19 pneumonia. Our study not only investigated the clinical manifestation in ESP-infected COVID-19 including fever, cough, fatigue, nausea, dizziness and so on, but also described countermeasures and potential risks for the health care workers. Of 54 ESP-infected COVID-19, all of patients showed longer and higher postoperative fever, also 81.5% patients with cough, 88.9% patients with fatigue, 96.3% patients with nausea and 85.2% patients with dizziness were observed. These associated clinical characteristic finding showed huge difference with reported cases for common COVID-19. The reason may be from the by-effects of surgery and anesthetics. In addition, all of them showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs. Suggesting that we can make the preliminary clinical diagnose in the period of COVID-19 pneumonia even in the future for the ESP with COVID-19.
