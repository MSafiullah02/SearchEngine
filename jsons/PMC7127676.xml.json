Xiong (2010) indicated key points of current problems, such as unreasonable allocation of resources and power, ambiguity of duties among departments, imperfect construction of emergency response centers, and lack of community and social participation. The joint operation of resources, jurisdictional overlap, and multiple organizational participants challenges the ability of government branches to work together. The concept of collaborative emergency management originated from collaborative governance. The essence is collaboration, which means that several sectors exert joint actions in favor of public interest (Bardach, 1998). The concept of governance highlights interorganizational or cross-agency joint decisions and a series of law and regulations (Ansell & Gash, 2008). Emergency collaboration is an essential element that leads to efficient response and rescue. To respond to large public emergencies that cause extensive consequences, such as industrial accidents, government agencies have started working in formal collaborations, wherein regular emergency response centers or institutions are established for joint emergency conferences. Some big cities have integrated urban management systems and coordinative emergency response, shared information among emergency centers from the local level, and improved the allocation of emergency resources.",

            "text": "Cross-agency collaboration is a crucial dimension in interorganizational integration research (Kahn & Mentzer, 1996). A stream of literature has examined the influential factors of organizational performance under complex environment, such as cross-agency horizontal integration's impact on organizational output, efficiency, and flexibility (Kahn & Mentzer, 1996). A high level of organizational flexibility in taking on unplanned non-routine tasks and working with unexpected new partners can be highly desirable in performing tasks in emergency responses (Provan & Lemaire, 2012). Network flexibility in switching from centralized coordination to emergent self-organizing coordination (Berthod, Grothe-Hammer, M\u00fcller-Seitz, Raab, & Sydow, 2017) is likely to be contingent on the stages of a crisis, its ambiguity and turbulence, and shifting scope and affected populations, such as in terrorist attacks, infectious disease outbreaks, and hurricanes. Trust is necessary in these fluid situations to implement effective collective actions (Moynihan, 2009a, Moynihan, 2009b). Relationships among agencies in emergency management scenarios are essentially collaborative because they require multiple emergency responses and recovery organizations to work collaboratively and efficiently to address the multifaceted and cross-boundary consequences of public emergency incidents (Kapucu & Garayev, 2013). Collaborative emergency management is a process wherein two or more organizations take joint urgent actions through knowledge sharing, information communication, and resource integration to accomplish a temporary task (Eom, Hwang, & Kim, 2018). The essence of government emergency management is the process of collaboration, which is the highest level of interaction from the interorganizational relationship perspective (Kapucu & Garayev, 2013). The communicative and collaborative relationship among government departments is crucial to the improvement of flexibility in emergency responses (Kapucu, Arslan, & Demiroz, 2010).",

Measurements, such as response time (timeliness) and survival rates, are commonly utilized (Braun, 1993; Tengs et al., 1995). Emergency response capability creates a collaborative power to match the size and deployment speed of resources committed with the changing needs of emergency, which is critical for effective emergency responses. However, the current research designs rarely provide systematic measurements for the capability or performance of collaborative emergency management, although the importance of cross-agency coordination and information sharing in improving organization effectiveness has been long recognized (Huang, 2014). Meanwhile, a variety of relational patterns, such as dense or sparse networks, emerges from the continuous interaction and cooperation among departments (Granovetter, 1985; Kapucu & Garayev, 2013). Therefore, cross-agency relationships in emergency collaborations can be considered networks among government departments. This study draws from the network perspective and extends rich research insights from the studies on supply chain networks to collaborative emergency management.",

            "text": "In practice, the Chinese government has built an emergency coordinating system, which includes institutions, working mechanisms, and a legal system based on government department duties. The system reflects multiple sets of contingency plans, which are drafted and dominated by different government agencies. The content of the plans is closely related to the structure of the Chinese government and shows vertical and horizontal integration among government agencies, which forms cross-agency networks (Liu, 2012). The information conveyed through the networks ensures the validity and completeness of emergency managers' comprehension of the situation, which leads to appropriate actions (Perry & Lindell, 2003). Nevertheless, the Tiao\u2013Kuai segmentation in all levels of Chinese government caused a malfunction in the network because Tiao and Kuai built different emergency information systems, please see Fig. 1\n. On the one hand, the Tiao system refers to different administrative levels with the same functionality, in which a lower bureau is not governed by the local government but by higher levels with same functionality vertically. On the other hand, the Kuai system denotes that bureaus in the horizontal level are administrated by the local government rather than the higher levels with certain functionalities. However, the emergency response process requires a unified leadership and agency collaboration across the Tiao and Kuai systems. Many leading departments of emergencies, which are derived from the Tiao system, such as fire departments, earthquake bureaus and others, are unauthorized by the higher levels to share information to other departments in the Kuai system, although they are in the same tier of the municipal government. Taking fire emergency as an example, the response requires collaboration between the fire department and municipal subordinate agencies, such as hospitals and police stations. Thus, the current contingency plans are deemed inflexible, costly, and inefficient to launch and are apt to form multi-channel management (Liu, 2012). Each related agency in charge of rescuing tasks in an emergency incident is facing strict accountability from the administration and citizens regardless of the administrative authority on the agency. As such, the embeddedness pattern between the Tiao and Kuai systems for collaborative emergency is an important research issue.",

Relational embeddedness focuses on the strength of a pairwise relationship on organizational actions. The existing research shows that strong ties are important for a successful transfer of complex, tacit, and sensitive knowledge (Huang, 2014). Frequent interaction and great familiarity are associated with better communication in disaster response communication networks (Nowell & Steelman, 2014). Trust in strong ties facilitates difficult cross-boundary collaboration (Tortoriello & Krackhardt, 2010), which is common in disaster response networks (Moynihan, 2009a, Moynihan, 2009b). Structural embeddedness focuses on the information and control advantages accrued from a premium position in a network. It assumes that networks are a \u201chilly social terrain that includes aspects of hierarchy.\u201d In a hierarchical network, many organizations enjoy strategic locations and are more important for diffusing information and exerting social control. In operational terms, this concept refers to the centrality of an organization. Network centrality describes the extent to which an organization is connected to other organizations (either directly or indirectly) within the web of exchanges that comprise a network (Diani, 2002). Central organizations are more embedded in the flow of information and resources in the network compared with non-central or peripheral actors and have typically been found to have greater power. In public management research, Provan, Huang, and Milward (2009) found that in a centrally governed health and human services network, an organization's structural embeddedness in the network as measured by its centrality is strongly related to its perceived trustworthiness, reputation, and influence.",

Thus, measurements, models, and theories can be borrowed from supply chain studies. The private sector focuses on the performance of the supply chain, such as customer query time and cost (Gunasekaran et al., 2004). By contrast, the government is concerned about the capacity to achieve network effectiveness at the community level (Provan and Milward, 2001), such as public perceptions that life and property loss are minimized through timely evacuation in emergency collaborations, which we refer to as collaborative emergency capability.",

The four important dimensions for business supply chain performance are cost of resources, output, timeliness, and flexibility (Gunasekaran et al., 2004; Okongwu, Deschamps, Lauras, & Fran\u00e7ois, 2011). The cost of resources in the emergency rescue process is a non-significant issue to the government compared with the urgency of securing public safety (Fan, 2013). Thus, measuring emergency management should consider the efficiency of collaborative actions (output and timeliness combined) and the flexibility of such actions. In operational terms, efficiency is the capability of a contingency plan to provide timely responses and reliable emergency response services (Gunasekaran et al., 2004). Furthermore, flexibility is the ability of a plan to adjust to the complex emergency environment and exhibit proper reactions (Karimi, Somers, & Gupta, 2004).",

The plan has many specific positions that allow corresponding departments (e.g., the leading department) to obtain a high level of accessibility in the network to ensure that they can rapidly spread and gather information (Schilling & Phelps, 2007). Departments with extensive connections are usually called central departments (Kim, Choi, Yan, & Dooley, 2011). According to previous studies, information sharing in supply networks will benefit the network at the operational level, for example, lowering the cost of supply chain, shrinking delivery time (Cachon & Fisher, 2000), and reducing the cost of inventory and stock-outs (Lee, So, & Tang, 2000). Therefore, the center department and its partners in the network in emergency collaboration scenarios will benefit from high information accessibility through a quick gathering of information to conduct proper and timely responsive actions. Thus, we present the following hypotheses:H1Information accessibility is associated with collaborative emergency capability.\nH1aHigh information accessibility (ACC) is associated with a positive impact on collaborative efficiency (EF).\nH1bHigh information accessibility (ACC) is associated with a positive impact on collaborative flexibility (FL).\n(2)Impact of information connectedness on collaborative emergency capability\n",

Inkpen and Tsang (2005) indicated that interconnectedness formed using multiple levels of shared information facilitates knowledge and information exchanges among firms and thereby enhances the flow of knowledge and information among them. Partners will benefit from the high level of interconnectedness through in-depth collaboration, resource, and potential of problem solving, all of which are conducted in tightly connected subgroups (Ahuja, 2000; Henning, 2018; Schilling & Phelps, 2007).

From the beginning of the 21st century, systematic studies on supply chain integration gradually increased as interorganizational collaboration processes become increasingly important (Zhao et al., 2008). When a disaster strikes, a cross-organizational workflow and an integrated information system should be created to ensure an efficient rescue (Fan, 2013). Therefore, the creation of a collaborative e-government has been an important strategy to guarantee the effective delivery of public services, such as emergency responses (Dawes, 2008; Dawes, Cresswell, Commentators, Bingham, & Caudle, 2009). In the development of e-governance, the integration is divided into three dimensions, namely, strategy, system, and data (Baum & Maio, 2000). However, following the emphasis of empirical research at the initial stage of the development of e-governance, only two distinct dimensions exist in the interdepartmental integration, namely, business integration and information technology (Koh, Prybutok, & Zhang, 2008). This study combines the two dimensions to measure workflow integration as a whole given that this study was conducted in China, where e-governance remains in its early stages.",

Although network embeddedness promotes access to external knowledge, organizational learning is a crucial, yet often overlooked, step in translating new external knowledge into revised organizational actions, particularly for the central actors in a network. In this study, we examine organizational learning via the classic concept of absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity is the ability of a firm to recognize, assimilate, exploit, and develop new information based on its original knowledge. As previously mentioned, information accessibility enables a department to obtain more information from its supply chain partners. Thus, this study proposes that improved absorptive capacity in emergency collaborations will enhance collaborative emergency capability. According to Ernst and Kim (2002), combining information accessibility and absorptive capacity is important to enable a firm to generate innovation from outside information. Absorptive capacity is also correlated to intra-organizational information sharing (Easterby Smith, Lyles, & Tsang, 2008). We take fire emergency as an example. The more necessary information that the fire department gains from hospitals and public safety departments in the network, the more emergency efficiency the collaboration promotes, provided that the fire department assimilates and integrates new information into the standard operating procedures or revises actions to meet the changing needs of the emergency. Therefore, absorptive capacity may positively moderate the relationship between information accessibility and collaborative emergency capability.H4Absorptive capacity enhances the relationship between information accessibility and collaborative emergency capability.\nH4aHigh absorptive capacity (AC) enhances the relationship between information accessibility and collaborative efficiency.\nH4bHigh absorptive capacity (AC) enhances the relationship between information accessibility and collaborative flexibility.\n",

A standard plan is composed of the organizational structure and operational mechanism at all phases of the emergency management. It also describes the responsibilities of the concerned departments and actions to take to respond to various levels of emergencies. This study uses a mixed method (Williams & Shepherd, 2017) to analyze a research sample of 110 contingency plans of F District in Shanghai. Data were obtained from the evaluation of the contingency plans in two ways. (1) The traditional Likert scale method measures several attributes of the contingency plan using mature scales from previous studies. (2) Social network method generates attributes from the network structure of the department network in each contingency plan. The network is established by assessing the context of the plan and whether or not two departments have certain interactions, as shown in Table 1\n. All stated departments in an emergency management office (committee) usually have bilateral interactions with one another. On the basis of this standard, an undirected relation matrix is constructed for each network in 110 plans, where 1 indicates the existence of interactions and 0 means none. Next, the matrix is calculated using two formulas to generate the two structural attributes of the network, namely, accessibility (Stephenson & Zelen, 1989) and connectedness (Borgatti, 1997; Borgatti & Halgin, 2011). Data gathered using the Likert scale and social network matrix were combined, and a multiple linear regression model was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses.

We used specific terminologies in emergency management to avoid ambiguity. The subjects include 110 contingency plans from F District in Shanghai. First, three scholars specialized in emergency management carefully studied each contingency plan, and a four-round Delphi method was conducted to score each item for the explanatory variables \u201cAbsorptive Capacity (AC),\u201d \u201cWorkflow Integration (WI),\u201d \u201cAccessibility (ACC),\u201d and \u201cInterconnectedness (INTC)\u201d and control variables \u201cPlan Management (PM)\u201d and \u201cYears in use (YR).\u201d The values of PM, YR, INTC, and ACC are attributes that were judged and assigned by reviewing the plan. The values of AC and WI are measured using a five-level Likert scale, where officials scored each item of the two variables. Furthermore, using a three-round Delphi method, we handed over the contingency plans to three government officials and repeated the scoring process for the dependent variables \u201cEfficiency (EF)\u201d and \u201cFlexibility (FL)\u201d in each plan. Officials are in charge of emergency duty of the district and evaluate the quality of submitted plans yearly. Therefore, EF and FL are the expected values of each plan that the local government desires and examines and are measured using a five-level Likert scale, where officials had to reach an agreement for each item of the two dependent variables. Their anonymous responses are aggregated and shared with three experts after each round. The experts are allowed to adjust their answers in subsequent rounds on the basis of their interpretation of \u201cexpert response\u201d that has been provided. The final value is reached on a five-level Likert value of a single contingency case after a maximum of three rounds. Next, we finalized the score of each question in each questionnaire and matched the control variables, independent, and dependent variables. Eventually, we obtained one scored questionnaire, including one department relation matrix for each contingency plan.",

When the leading department is powerful in collecting information from the collaboration network, the avoidance of low efficiency due to asymmetric information is easy, which improves collaborative efficiency. Information accessibility has a negative correlation with flexibility, which is the opposite of our assumption. After the analysis, we found that high accessibility indicates the complicated relationship between departments. The network may have multiple centers, which prevents the leading department from making rapid changes in strategies, namely, flexibility. This finding corresponds to that of Bock, Opsahl, George, and Gann (2012). For example, the fire department from Tiao and emergency response center from Kuai built two information systems for emergency management. The emergency response center makes every effort to coordinate other departments in the Kuai system to gain more required information for the fire department, which greatly enhances the ability of collaborative efficiency of the fire department in leading the emergency response process. However, the fire department and emergency response center are two main nodes in the network (Fig. 2(1)). If the leading department makes fast changes to meet the needs of emergency evolution, then the coordination of the two main nodes will be slow for reacting because they are two different systems rather than a uniform system led by the fire department.",

As strategic collaborations occur among government departments, managers and staff from different departments become familiar, and as their ties strengthen officially and unofficially, the communication barriers decrease during emergencies. Therefore, collaborative efficiency is improved. Similarly, if the leading department can mobilize more resources during emergencies, then they can regularly have more collaboration with other departments. The trust and familiarity cultivated through this process will enhance the executive power of the interdepartmental system and thus provide flexibility (H3b) when strategies change. Based on the aforementioned analysis, workflow integration is the macro basis of improving collaborative emergency capability. When departments work closely together, the leading department can improve the exploitation of information at the micro-level to create positive impacts on the efficiency of the entire collaboration network. For example, if the fire department carries out strategic collaboration, information sharing, and business integration with other related departments, such as hospitals, police stations, and transit authority, and cultivates trust with other agencies, then collaborative emergency capability can be improved.",

Moreover, Fig. 5(1) shows that the positive correlation between accessibility and efficiency strengthens as absorptive capacity increases. This finding indicates that as the leading department enhances its absorptive capacity, the collaborative efficiency of the plan improves as a whole. Interestingly, compared with the control group, efficiency decreases as we add in the moderation of absorptive capacity, and only when absorptive capacity is at a high level (mean plus a standard deviation) can efficiency surpass the control group. Therefore, we infer that the moderating variable further describes the reality where low levels of absorptive capacity are unable to facilitate the leading department in exploiting large amounts of information to improve collaborative capacity. In actual emergency management, many factors hinder the absorptive capacity of the leading department. Such barriers include the fact that data resources are physically scattered among various departments in the Tiao and Kuai systems. Therefore, the leading departments face difficulty in absorbing valuable information from the data, and distortion occurs during data transfer. Fig. 5(2) shows that information accessibility has a negative correlation with flexibility. However, as absorptive capacity increases, the negative relationship between accessibility and flexibility weakens. This finding implies that when the leading department enhances its absorptive capacity, filtering information helps to create emergency decisions and improve flexibility during collaborative emergency actions.",

Workflow integration indeed improves the efficiency and flexibility of emergency collaboration, and the leading department plays a crucial role in the process as its information accessibility and absorptive capacity significantly enhance the collaborative capacity of the entire network. However, as Table 2 shows, governments remain ill-prepared for emergency collaboration in several ways. Emergency collaboration is based on the integration of workflow, which is relatively weak, as indicated by a low mean score of 2.73 among the government departments. Moreover, the absorptive capacity of the government is far from high, with a mean score of 3.06. Thus, policy makers should invest resources into the enhancement of workflow integration and absorptive capacity. The lack of workflow integration can negatively affect the timely exchange of crucial information about an unfolding crisis and hamper effective responses. For example, in Beijing city government's response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis in 2002, the absence of workflow integration between military and civilian health authorities significantly delayed the government's response and contributed to a wide outbreak. Collective learning by the network of involved agencies during crises can be promoted by the facilitated sharing of failure and best practices among agencies' personnel, information systems, and virtual experiences (Moynihan, 2009a, Moynihan, 2009b).

As Phillips, Lawrence, and Hardy (2000) pointed out, powerful participants in collaboration relations are able to advocate their interpretations of issues more forcefully than others and privilege their position and capabilities. However, in terms of flexibility, the leading department in a complicated network will encounter difficulty in mobilizing resources or executing changes expeditiously as redundant relations can reduce flexibility. Thus, avoiding micromanagement and setting extremely specific goals in a fast-moving crisis situation are wise decisions for policy makers. Goal setting has been found to be associated with predictable side effects in business research, which includes hampering of learning and collaboration by encouraging negative competition (Ordonez et al., 2009). Without detailed goal setting, collaboration pertains to increased autonomy and flexibility in responding to complex urban crises, such as mass infectious disease outbreaks, hurricanes, and serious air pollution.",
