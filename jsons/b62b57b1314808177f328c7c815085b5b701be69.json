Asthma has recently been de\u00aened as a``chronic in\u00afammatory disease of the respiratory tract in which a number of cells have an important pathogenic role, including mastocytes, eosinophils, and the T lymphocytes. In susceptible individuals this speci\u00aec in\u00afammation provokes recurring episodes of dyspnoea, a sense of suffocation, thoracic constrictions and coughing, above all during the night and in the early hours of the morning'' (35). Generally, it is divided into``allergic'' (or extrinsic) and``nonallergic'' (or intrinsic) (36). The accumulation of eosinophils in the airways, the production of various proin\u00afammatory cytokines leading to the activation of endothelial cells inducing, in turn, adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 (37), VCAM-1, selectins, and RANTES, leads to a complex in\u00afammatory process which ends with several clinical expressions that depend both on the various stimuli and on individual responses based, for asthmatic subjects, mainly on atopy (38\u00b145).",

By subsequently measuring the parameters of the\u00afow-volume loop (FEV 1 in particular) at 5-min intervals up to 30 min, it is possible to determine whether the subject is positive for EIB (54, 55) . A subject is considered positive when the FEV 1 is reduced by at least 10% (in athletes) or 15% (in sedentary subjects) compared to base values. In the case of a positive outcome of the test, it is essential for the extent of the problem to be evaluated, and therapeutic safeguards put into effect for the patient under examination.",
